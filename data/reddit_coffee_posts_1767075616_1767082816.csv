I am recently back from a cruise aboard the MSC world America. As early risers we made good use of the coffee emporium which opened at 7.00 am each morning (6.30 on port days). We are now booked to go on the Grandiosa, and I have just noticed there doesn't appear to be a dedicated coffee shop. What early morning coffee options are available that are included the the premium drinks package? I wasn't a fan of the coffee in the buffet, so I hope I'm not limited to that?

1pzcjvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1pzcjvr/confessions_of_an_undercover_exventist/,Confessions of an Undercover Exventist,"I am a third-generation Seventh-day Adventist, raised in what I would call a moderately conservative family. I was homeschooled all the way from kindergarten through to high school graduation. I attended an Adventist university. I met my wife there, and we got married far too young because I couldn't stand another second of the mandatory celibacy of singleness (joke's on me; I'm still mostly celibate). She's a PK and very devout. We still live in the same college town, and despite my pleading because I hate this place, she refuses to leave because she thinks it's the best place on earth to raise our two kids because it is permeated by Adventism, with multiple SDA schools, including a homeschool co-op. She's heavily involved in one of the local churches. We're both Master Guides. I spent a year as our club's drill instructor and really love working with the kids.

My deconstruction began, though I didn't realize it at the time, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I saw the dramatic explosion of the anti-vax movement and witnessed the way it gained such a foothold in the SDA Church. Around the same time, my wife and I went on a two-week ""health retreat"" run by an ""independent ministry"" with some really culty vibes that sold us (at no small price) all sorts of pseudoscientific nonsense specially designed to appeal to true believers in the ""health message,"" and turned out to be the gateway into a whole underworld of ""alternative medicine."" I was skeptical but my wife bought it hook, line, and sinker, and is unflappably convinced it saved her life. It has cost us who knows how many thousands of dollars, all out of pocket because of course insurance doesn't cover coffee enemas.

While she got sucked deeper and deeper into the crunchy tinfoil-hat ecosystem populated by the likes of Barbera O'Neill and now gets most of her news from AI-generated TikTok videos and, worse still, Candace Owens, I got jolted into actually thinking critically for the first time in my life. I actually started applying the academic methodology my not-terribly-devout history professor (I majored in history) had spent five years trying to help me grasp. I realized the same scientific illiteracy that turns people into anti-vaxers and flat-earthers is also what turns them into creationists and climate change deniers. In the space of about four years I went from being a conservative libertarian to a democratic eco-socialist. And I lost my faith in the inspiration of Ellen White and the historicity of the Bible.

I'm in law school now and loving every minute of it--and dreading coming home on the weekends. Even there I can't escape the SDA sphere if influence because I'm living in a house owned by the local church during the week, which of course means I am required to attend Bible classes. Other than my classmates at law school, my social circle is almost entirely SDAs. I feel disconnected from my wife and generally isolated. I don't feel, I guess, safe coming out publicly as an agnostic with Christian existentialist tendencies; not to my parents, not to my wife, and not to more than a handful of my closest (my few non-SDA) friends. I guess this is my way of introducing myself and thanking y'all for being a virtual community where I can find some of the acceptance and camaraderie that is absent in my ""real"" life.",1,1767082356.0,exAdventist,0,1.0,False
1pzciw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pzciw4/is_this_guy_from_my_uni_being_friendly_or_lowkey/,Is this guy from my uni being friendly or low-key interested?,"
I’m a first-year uni student and there’s this guy from my university who followed me on Instagram (we have a few mutuals but don’t actually know each other in real life).

It started when I posted a birthday story and he replied wishing me happy birthday and asking how I was celebrating. He also shared details about his birthday and said things like celebrating with friends is nice.

The next day he asked how my birthday went, which I found a little unexpected since we don’t really know each other and even some of my close friends didn’t ask how it went. Most people usually leave it at wishing.

Then on Christmas I posted a simple “Merry Christmas” note, and he replied “Merry Christmas :)” and immediately added:
“Should def hang out and do something quick like go for a coffee when we get back to school.”

I said yeah sure, just let me know when.

Later, he guessed I was from Seattle and when I asked how he knew, he replied:
“May or may not have looked at your bio 😳🫢”

One more thing: he’s graduating this year (so he’s older) and I’m a first-year.

Only he has been the one initiating contact and suggesting meeting up.

So I’m confused, does this sound like someone just being friendly and social, or someone who’s low-key interested but trying to keep it chill? Also I think it is really weird for anyone to reach out to someone like this and I think when a random guy slides into a girl’s DMs, it didn’t always seem 100% platonic.",1,1767082254.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

She is a student at the same university I attend, and we have gone on a total of three dates. We had seen each other in uni before but started talking on Instagram.

On the very first date we were talking and I, by mistake, called her by another name (I sometimes confuse names) and she didn't take it well at all. She started shivering and and got up and said, this was a mistake and went to her female friends and had a melt down. She had tears and even skipped class and all the time her friend was consoling her. I was also there trying to calm her down. Eventually, she calmed down and we went for a coffee where I told her I sometimes forget and confusenames and dates (which the way it came out from my mouth looked like some mental problem.

We call daily and she has grown incredibly attached to me. She even has planned out when we are going to marry, what the names of our children would be and all he things in between.
I mean, we did started off saying we are not looking for casuals and want a problem long-term thing where marriage is expected (I live in South Asia where marriage is how it should go if you are serious). 

She has told me about her anxiety and panic attacks and I have experienced it first had over the 2 weeks of us being together. I'm not sure I'm the right one for her. She has grown incredibly attached. I want a way out without making it hard for her and soon so that she is fine with losing me and can explore other options and not waste her time with me. I have made up some issues relating to me and my fam. She genuinly thinks I have some disorders and she can ""fix"" me. She is incredibly smart, sweet and kind and good looking and I just realized I don't want a relationship and want to focus on my studies.

Any help and suggestions in this regard would be really helpfu.

That's difficult because when I wake up and go to sleep are always random, I've no idea what time I'll go to bed and then wake up the next day 🤣

If you see me online on my Nintendo pro just join me randomly and if I forgot to log out of the game/with my console on rest mode just send me a text on Discord as that works as well.

Feel free to send me a dms if you want to exchange Nintedo codes and I'll add you. 

However the time here is 2 a.m. and I can play something on Splatoon 3 for an hour before I get ready to go to bed in Arcadia, but I can text you on Discord. 

Yeah, obviously with Discord I don't know how many people in this subreddit have this problem but I cannot focus on a voice call and focus on playing a video game at the same time I can't. 

Yeah, I can send a voice clip here and there when something epic happens on a match or if Grizzco gets crazy I'll laugh in the voice clip and say what was super-funny to me 🤣 

Yeah, I've a online friend that play Splatoon 3 with and my online friend told me that they focus better when playing music instead of listening to the music on Splatoon 3, obviously I mean hey every single person has their quirks when gaming. 

Yeah, obviously my quirk is something too can't set to forget that I'll never have the gamer ability to focus worth of sht if I've too many distractions 💀 

Yeah, for me I enjoy Splatoon 3 soundtracks and I'd have that at a good volume 🐻 

Splatoon 3 Grizzco rank, my favorite things to do in Splatoon 3 and random topics about Splatoon 3 Main Lobby.

Yeah on Splatoon 3 if your Grizzco work rank is lower than mine, you can't level up your work rank and you can still receive the capsule rewards though, obviously your fish scales as well. My level in Grizzo is.

Profreshional only and I've reached Profreshional+2 is the highest I ever reached on Grizzco rank.

Haven't completed all the story modes, but I want to. However, I'm down to play whatever you want though even if it's just 30 minutes of Turf Wars and 30 minutes of Main Lobby.

Just know on Salmon Run and if you see me on Profreshional playing with you and I don't know how to use the sniper weapons, that's because I don't use those and I'm close to a noob how to use one 💀

Yeah, I'm not the only one on Profreshional rank that just doesn't knows how to use a sniper weapon as a pro 🤣

Yeah, I've seen one of my squad-team members looked so confused on how to use this weapon 🤣

Yeah, I'm not even a fan of camper style weapons, where you sit, camp and perch yourself high up.

That's not me and my style brand on Splatoon 3.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons.

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out.

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Bio time 🐻

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap alternative clothes style clothes from Walmart, Temu and Amazon 💀 and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest.

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress in black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I'd own 9 Sleep Token shirts and I've already posted them on my pro if you scroll all the way down.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts.

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official.

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair.

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now?

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting?

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks?

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink?

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

1pzceum,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1pzceum/i_was_going_to_sit_there/,I was going to sit there,"Sale shopping with my arthritic mother a couple of days ago, we decided to stop for a pot of tea in a popular chain bookshop in southern England. It was two days after Christmas so everywhere was *busy*. I could tell she needed a rest as we’d walked a long way with a number of stairs involved. 

As we entered, I spotted a couple in a booth who looked like they were finishing up. Perfect. I quickly wove my way through the intervening tables. We exchanged polite chitchat as they finished putting on their coats  and then they left. My mother was still working her way around the busy tables behind me. 

I had just put my bags down on the seat when a woman appeared from the direction of the serving counter snapping “I was going to sit there”. She had a coffee in one hand and a very affronted look on her face. I was confused to face such British aggression. I was clearly there first and there had been no indication that anyone else had claimed the table. She glared at me clearly expecting me to apologise, remove my bags and vacate the booth. She must have seen the couple putting their coats on from where she was at the counter as well. But that means she must also have seen me arrive at the table and claim it. 

At this point, my mother appeared behind me. Now if she hadn’t been there I might have felt the Christmas spirit and let the entitled woman take the table. But Mum needed to sit down. 

This quiet very British woman (me) is proud that I was able to say, “I was here first” with no caveat, no sorry or any form of apology. I could see she had expected me to give up the table and didn’t know how to process that I said no. Entitled woman stood there for a long moment glaring before huffing off to the other side of the coffee area. As she got there, a couple left their comfy armchairs and she was able to sit straight away and her friend joined her shortly afterwards. 

I got my mum settled, joined the queue and we had our pots of tea. Happily, Mum even had a cheeky ginger biscuit to dip that she’d saved from another cafe.

A few weeks earlier, while scrolling through youtube a video caught my attention (I saved it to watch later) which was about this guy maintaining a notebook and just being consistent with tracking his good & bad habits.

Also, before this, I have watched videos where some influencers claim to make a lot of money—as a beginner!!—from selling online products like sketchbooks, journals etc online... which is very misleading. Also, with a highly AI dependent procedure. So, this was also ruminating in the back of my head but in a negative light.

Few days later, I saw a video again, where an artist was making a cute bunny doodle, as a logo for a coffee brand, on a dotted  sketchbook: metallic-spiral and plain black cover (it was love at first sight and I wanted that love too... but alas, I couldn't find a similar journal on the internet)

Also, since the beginning of December, I have been reading a book where the author mentioned a famous artist always carrying a hand-sized notebook—even going to the extent of always wearing outfits with pockets only, to implement that habit!

And while all this has been happening, I am also amidst reflecting on my mood and energy levels throughout the day, my response to caffeine, and how all of these factors are impacted by and/or impact my menstrual cycle (I won't be surprised if I get diagnosed with PMS. The luteal phase makes me lethargic, sad, moody, and acne-prone, and extremely fragile to the point that I will cry if I don't find my socks in like next fifteen seconds...I promise, it's relevant to the post 😭)



*Drumrolls* 
The great *AHA MOMENT* was this sudden realisation that I should invest in a proper sketch/notebook—preferably plain black, from a local store and NOT online—and observe my emotional mood synergy, sleep quality, physical energy levels, creative flow(fun fact: ovulatory phase is generally linked with higher creativity), and a lot more: by penning it down from January 1st of the next year till the last date of December. 
 (I kinda reached to this realisation after ruminating over all pros and cons, but it is also a major simplification of all the ways my brain process things like in big colorful imagery, a weird non-colorful shape and sometimes I am not even thinking, just zoning out and forgetting about why I zoned out .Though never actively; it all happened like background music in my brain while I was focused on other things i.e, the lyrical form of songs)

Ps:- Most of the time, we just forget to track back our thinking (Ti) after reaching the conclusion unless we are actively trying to unfold our reasoning. Hence, once in a blue moon, a Ni dom will uncharacteristically warn you about something or trusting someone or something along those directions; without giving a logical explanation for their action—if we are really close, yep we are picky like that.

Thank you, for coming to my TED talks :D

**TL; DR**:- Ni is hard to explain as it's very specific and personal.
For me, it's like curating ten different insights; on so many topics but you can feel a pattern and keep the similar ones together, stacked in your neurons for future. 
The insights might be of one week, one month or picked up throughout your lifetime, subconsciously of course ;)
AND
Yaaaaay! Now that the dots are connected, you have got this one-of-a-kind product or solution for the question that nobody ever asked for.",1,1767081188.0,INTP,1,1.0,False

Recently moved into a unit which has an over the range microwave but the microwave itself is missing the turntable wheel ring and it causes the turntable to lean heavily to one side. 

I cannot use it to heat coffee or anything liquid as the tilt causes it to slide forward and spill outside the microwave. Is this something landlord should fix or I just have to live with it ?

1pzc3pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1pzc3pf/tifu_by_using_a_litter_scoop_to_serve_cake_at_my/,TIFU by using a litter scoop to serve cake at my office birthday party,"this didn't happen today, but rather last friday. I'm still feeling the heat from the stares in the breakroom, so it feels fresh enough.



I recently started a new job at a fairly buttoned up corporate office. I've been trying hard to fit in, be the ""cool but responsible"" guy, and participate in office culture. Last week was our team lead's birthday, and since I bake as a hobby, I volunteered to bring in a homemade sheet cake.



I went all out. Triple chocolate, ganache, the works. I baked it Thursday night, packed it up, and felt great. Friday morning, I’m rushing out the door and realize I don't have a cake server or a spatula that fits in my bag. No problem, I think literally. I'll just grab something on the way or improvise.



On my drive to work, I stopped at a pet supply store to pick up some things for my cat. I grabbed a bag of food, some toys, and because I’m an idiot who loves efficiency I saw a sturdy, metal litter scoop. It was one of those ""heavy duty"" aluminum ones. Wide, flat, slots for... well, sifting.



My brain, in its infinite pre coffee wisdom, made a connection: ""That looks exactly like a cake server, just with slots. It’s metal, it’s brand new, it’s clean. It’s perfect.""



I bought it. I removed the sticker tag in the car. I wiped it down with a sanitizing wipe I keep in my glovebox because I'm sanitary, ironically.



Fast forward to 2 PM. The team gathers in the breakroom. Everyone is singing ""Happy Birthday."" I unveil the cake. Oohs and aahs. It looks delicious.



I pull out my ""server.""



I start cutting slices. The scoop actually works amazingly well. The slots help the cake release easily. I’m handing out plates. Three or four people are already eating.



Then, Sarah from HR speaks up. She’s staring at my hand. The room goes quiet.



""OP,"" she asks, her voice trembling slightly. ""Is that... a litter box scoop?""



I look at the scoop. I look at her. I smile, thinking this is a funny observation. ""Yeah. It works surprisingly well, right? Look how clean the slices are coming out.""



Silence.



The chewing stops.



Dave, the birthday boy, slowly lowers his fork. ""You're serving my birthday cake with a cat shit scooper?""



""It's brand new."" I say quickly, realizing the optics. ""I literally bought it this morning on the way here. It has never touched a litter box.""



But the damage was done. The mental image was planted.



""Did you wash it?"" someone asks from the back.



""I used a sanitizing wipe."" I argue.



""A wipe? You used a car wipe on the pooper scooper and then put it in the food?""



Panic sets in. ""No, it's it's sterile. It's metal. It's just a shape. It’s a tool.""



Nobody wanted any more cake. The three people who had already taken bites looked like they were trying to calculate the inducibility of vomiting. Sarah just walked out. Dave looked at the cake, looked at me, and said, ""Thanks for the thought, man,"" in the saddest voice I’ve ever heard.



I ended up taking 80% of a triple chocolate cake home. I am now known as ""Scoops"" in the office. I don't think I'm ever going to live this down.



TL,DR: Bought a brand new metal litter scoop to serve cake at an office party because I forgot a spatula. Coworkers didn't care that it was new, they only saw a poop shovel. I ruined the party and am now the office pariah.",6,1767080739.0,tifu,8,0.71,False

I already check the difference between the two, and the notable difference are:

H10 plus: has solenoid valve
H13: dual thermoblock and separate hot water

I usually drink americano or long black since I'm limiting my sugar intake due to my diabetes. 

What I like about the H13 is the convenience of making americano/long black. And also it has a stainless grouphead (I believe based on the YT reviews)

But the H10 plus has more control and customizable settings. It also have the solenoid valve.

One of my hesitation on the h13 is because there is no solenoid valve. Does it really matter on the taste consitency? 

Btw, I have been a filter coffee drinker and wanted to shift to espresso. And one thing, I already have the HiBrew G5 grinder.

Bella

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.

Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.

“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”

She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”

“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”

“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”

I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”

But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.

I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.

After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.

The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrilled that I said yes right away. We fixed a wedding date with our families. We booked the hall, picked flowers, and chose the cake. I kept a list for everything, doing things personally even though my father had a fleet of personnel to work for me.

As soon as Lucy left our wedding boutique, I snuck out. I put the gown in my car and drove to Craig’s apartment. I had a key he gave me months ago. He had said, “Use it when you want to surprise me.” I smiled at the memory. The building had a private elevator. I rode up and stepped into his foyer.

The living room was quiet. I set the garment bag on the sofa and called out softly, “Craig?” There was no answer. His shoes were by the door, and his jacket was on a chair. He had to be home.

I walked down the hall toward the bedroom. As I got closer, I saw a trail of clothes on the floor. A red lace top, a silk skirt, bra and panties, and a pair of heels tipped on their sides. I stopped and blinked. It looked like someone undressed in a hurry. I smiled to myself. “Must be Evan,” I whispered. Craig’s younger cousin liked to drop by without warning with a date. I rolled my eyes and decided to leave. I picked up the garment bag and turned to go when I heard a soft sound. It was a low breathy moan from Craig’s bedroom. Feeling embarrassed, I increased my pace. But froze the next moment when a man’s voice came through the door, rough and loud. “Mayaaaa!”

Shock rippled through me and I stopped moving. Was that Craig’s voice? No, God, no. My first thought was that I misheard. My stepsister, Maya, hadn’t come back to the city in four years. She never showed her face to us even once ever since she left after that fight. I turned over my shoulder to look at the half-closed bedroom door. Despite myself, I turned back. I reached and saw that the door was slightly open. The room was dim, but I could see enough.

Craig was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair fell across the pillow. He was holding her, naked, and moving inside her. He said her name again, “Oh, Maya!”

Everything in me went quiet as my mind numbed in shock. I stood there for a few seconds, my hands turning clammy, my heart thundering. Craig and Maya together? When did this happen? I had read about this happening in books. You know, just fiction. But this cliché happened in real life as well?

The world tilted so fast I felt dizzy. I slapped my hand on my mouth to stop the sound of my gasp. My mind clicked through little details when I turned around. I noticed a glass of water on the nightstand was half full. There was a smudge of lipstick on the rim. There was a small backpack in the corner with a labubu doll, which was Maya’s. I stepped back, the hallway suddenly too long, the air too thin. I couldn’t breathe.

Unable to process the shock, I turned and went back to the living room. I picked up the garment bag with both hands, opened the door, and walked out.

Inside the elevator, I looked at the reflection of my 23 year old self. Through my pale face, my green eyes stared at me, my blond hair sticking to my face, which was covered with sweat. It was then that I broke down. A sob tore from me making my body shudder. The betrayal was too much to bear. But anger also surged through me, and suddenly I wanted to confront them. How could they do this to me?

So without thinking twice, I went back to his apartment to confront them.

A Video

Bella

I stood in the hallway and tried to breathe, wondering what I was doing? Should I go in? My confidence wavered.

But I wanted to open the door and shout at them, make them face me. I wanted to ask why, since when, and how could they betray me. I wanted to look at Maya and say, “You stole my fiancé.”

My steps faltered because I also knew how Maya was. She would deny everything in front of our father. She would say I was jealous and that I was lying. Just like last time. She would cry like she had done before. Just before leaving home, she played a victim card, making me look like the villain of her life.

But I wanted to ask Craig if any of the last five years meant anything. Gathering courage and wiping my tears, I walked into the apartment.

Just as I reached outside the bedroom, I heard Maya’s soft and smug voice. She said, “You’ve kept it a secret for four years. I’m so proud of you, Craig. You’re awesome! I only wanted to finish college and then marry you. I couldn’t bear to see my stepsister have your kids.”

Craig laughed. “Bella’s a moron,” he said. “She’s so blind in love with me she never notices anything. It was easy to manipulate her.”

Manipulate me? I stood still and held my breath, my tears silently slipping from my eyes once again.

Maya chuckled and spoke again in a sultry voice, “I’m waiting for your divorce. Then we can start our own business. I’ve been dreaming about it for so long!”

Craig sounded pleased. “Of course, love. I’ll divorce Bella in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to her husband. That’s what her grandfather wrote in his will. So, it will all come to us, baby. I only have to tolerate her for a month more.”

I pressed my palm to the wall because I felt like I might fall. My heart pounded in my ears. I knew about my inheritance. Everyone in the family knew that I would get it after marriage and lose it if I divorced within six months.

Maya chuckled. “You're smart, Craig Jones. Gosh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around the house like she owns everything. The bitch doesn’t know how fast her world is going to crumble. Then I will exact my revenge. After she loses her inheritance, her father will remove her from his will also,” she snickered.

Craig laughed hard. “You’re wicked, Maya. Just be patient for a few more weeks, baby. Then we will have it all!”

They had planned my downfall carefully for so long. If I confronted them, it would be the most foolish thing to do.

“Come, ride me, baby!” Craig said. “Let’s celebrate!”

Anger inside me erupted like a volcano. Celebrate my downfall? I wanted to teach them a lesson now. So I took out my phone, and started recording them. If I sent this video to my father, I was sure he would call off the marriage.

“Oh baby, you’re so good!” Craig said as Maya moved on him.

My hand shook so hard in anger that a few seconds later, my phone slipped down. Craig snapped his head toward me. “Bella!” he gasped, his eyes going wide.

Maya also turned sharply to see me, and her mouth dropped open. “Shit!”

I picked up the phone and rushed out.

Craig removed Maya from him and came after me. “Bella, Bella!”

“I don’t want to hear a thing from you!” I shouted, as I scrambled to send the video to Daddy.

“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t!”

I opened the door. “You both deserve to be exposed!”

“Stop this bullshit, Bella!” he roared. “No one will marry you except me! Your marriage with me is written in stone!”

“I’d rather die than marry you, cheater!” I shouted back through my tears. I pressed the button to send the video to my father.

Craig came after me. But I was out of the door by then. He stood naked on the door of his apartment, watching me leave. “Bellaaaa!” he roared. A few people came out of their apartments hearing the commotion. Good. They would see him naked, dripping in her juices.

I left the apartment building as fast as I could, and went to my car. On the road, the city lights blurred a little. I blinked, trying to clear my vision. My mind played back the words I had just heard. ‘It was a secret for five years’. ‘Divorce in a month’. ‘Twenty million inheritance gone’. ‘Tolerate her for a month more’. ‘I rubbed my chest as the betrayal hurt deep’.

I gripped the steering wheel. I thought about Lucy and her firmly denying me to meet Craig. Did she know? Was she helping them keep me away so I would not see anything? So that their plan was executed smoothly?

Then I thought about my father. If I called him now and told him what I saw, what I heard, would he believe me? No, he wouldn’t. That’s why I sent the video proof. He loved me, but he thought I was an “entitled brat.”

If I hadn’t recorded them in the act, Maya would lie through her teeth in front of him just to get the money. I didn’t trust Craig either. He would rather watch me suffer and make the marriage more miserable.

I remembered how four years ago, after high school, Maya left the house after a fight. She told everyone I was the reason. The house was full of tension for weeks. My father chose to calm Lucy and Maya instead of me. But despite his efforts, Maya left never to return. Since then, Daddy treated me like I might start another problem at any moment. He watched me like I was a risk to manage. He scolded me often because of Maya.

I remembered that fight like it happened yesterday. Maya had cried so much that day, her sobs filled every corner of the house. She stood in front of my father and her mother, acting like she was the victim. She said she would always be a stepsister and that I could never accept her. Then, with a trembling voice, she offered to leave the house so I could live “comfortably.” Lucy’s eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t protest. She only lowered her head and suffered quietly, as if Maya’s sacrifice was breaking her heart.

But the truth was different. The fight started because on the last day of our school, I had caught Maya with Luke. I had confessed to her a week before that I liked Luke.

I had seen her sitting close to him, cuddling him, kissing him on his lips. When I confronted her later, she smiled in a way she wasn’t ashamed. On the contrary, she flaunted her “victory”. “He never liked you!” she had said, flicking her hair.

The betrayal from Luke was nothing compared to the one from Maya. “You can have him,” I replied.

I stifled my feelings for Luke right after so that Maya could be with him. But I don’t know why Maya came home and created the drama, accusing me of just the opposite? She told our parents that it was me who kissed her boyfriend, Luke, and I hated her for being happy. My father believed her and scolded me to be more adjusting. But Maya left for college nonetheless, trapping me into guilt all this while.

It was during that painful time that Craig, Luke’s friend, stepped in. He comforted me, chased after me, and slowly, I fell in love with him. But now Maya had her claws in Craig as well. It was like she wanted to snatch everything I cherished.

You'll Be Safe

Bella

I didn’t know where to go after leaving Craig’s apartment. My chest still hurt deep from the betrayal, and my thoughts kept circling the same question—how could Maya do this to me again?

Before I knew it, I was parking in front of the Phoenix Mall, the largest and grandest mall in the city. It had chains across the world, and I had heard that its CEO, Scott Moore, was a secretive sharp billionaire bachelor. He was arrogant, and cold, more handsome than God, and had hundreds of girls swooning over him.

I wandered through the bright halls of the mall and walked into a quiet café. The smell of coffee and baked bread wafted in the air. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at a small table by the window. The moment the cup was in my hands, tears started to fall again. I tried to wipe them quickly, but they kept coming. I cried quietly, hoping no one noticed. I couldn’t believe my life had come to this. How was I supposed to stop a marriage my whole family had already planned? Would my father believe the video content? I wondered if I should make the video viral.

Just as I lowered my head to sip my coffee, the door opened, and two men walked in. My heart skipped. It was Luke and Mark, Craig’s friends. Luke was the same boy who I liked in high school before Maya destroyed it all. I quickly bent my head lower, hoping they wouldn’t notice me. They sat two tables behind me, talking and laughing. I couldn’t help but overhear them.

“Bella has always been a moron,” Luke chuckled, stirring his coffee. “She never noticed Craig and Maya were in love. Stupid blind brat. Maya is back in town and she'll be staying with me for a while.”

Mark laughed loudly. “But it works for us, Luke. Craig smartly handled Bella after you goofed up with her. Once he gets Bella’s inheritance, we’re set. Our contracts with him are already drafted. The moment the money comes, we’ll sign. Our businesses will finally take off. Only a month before final goodbye to the bitch!” They both laughed again.

My blood went cold. I clutched my cup so tightly I thought it might break. Their words sank in slowly but clearly. They were all in on it. Craig, Maya, Luke, and Mark. They weren’t just betraying me with love. They were plotting around my inheritance. My stomach twisted, bitterness coating my soul. This all was happening behind my back ever since high school, and like a fool, I never came to know. How gullible I was?

Anger burned in my chest. I wanted to go to their table and confront them, scream that I had come to know it all. On an impulse, I pushed my chair back and stood up quickly. But the moment I turned, I collided with someone. Arms gripped me instantly to stop me from falling.

I craned my neck up, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. A beautiful man, towering over me with broad shoulders, filled the space. He was wearing a pinstripe suit. His face was striking with a sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and dark eyes so intense they seemed to glow. His lips were firm and bow-shaped, his nose straight, his black hair falling just slightly across his forehead. He looked unreal, like a man who didn’t belong to this world. Like a king who ruled the world.

I noticed that there was complete silence in the café now. In that instant, an idea lit up in my mind. A reckless, desperate plan that could actually break the marriage.

I tilted my head slightly, giving Luke and Mark a sidelong glance, then turned back to the man. Without giving myself time to think, I pressed my lips against his.

He growled low in his throat as his hand shot out and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me close. It was protective, possessive, and startling all at once. My body went stiff in his arms, but from the corner of my eyes, I saw Luke and Mark watching us. Their mouths had fallen open. Everyone in the café had turned to stare.

The kiss was quick at first, just enough for everyone to see. I whispered against his lips, “Please, could you keep up the act for a minute?”

To my surprise, he didn’t push me away. Instead, his hand tightened on my waist, and he kissed me back. His lips were warm and commanding. He deepened the kiss, and the world around me blurred. His kiss was passionate, strong, almost overwhelming. For a moment, I forgot why I even started it. I felt my knees weaken, and I had to hold on to his shirt to stay steady.

When we finally broke apart, the café was completely silent. My lips tingled, my cheeks burned, and I couldn’t get a hold of myself. Like my whole body was on fire. 

But I knew Luke and Mark had seen everything. Now they would inform Craig or my father about it. So if the video didn’t work, this would.

“Could you please walk out with me from the café?” I asked softly. “I want them to see it clearly,” I said, darting my eyes to Luke and Mark.

“Do you want me to make them disappear from the face of the earth?” he asked seriously, his intense eyes locked on mine.

My mouth dropped. Was he a mafia boss? I let out a nervous chuckle. “N-no!”

Without waiting, he grabbed my wrist and walked with me toward the door. I glanced back. Luke and Mark had jumped up, chasing us. Panic rushed through me. I pulled closer to the man and whispered urgently, “Please, help me. Hide me for a few hours. I want to escape them.” Now I was afraid that they would confront me and manhandle me.

His dark eyes cut to me. “You shouldn’t trust strangers,” he said in a low and rough voice.

I faltered, my lips parting. I didn’t know what to say. I felt foolish and desperate. But then his eyes softened. “But I’ll save you,” he said.

Something in me believed him instantly. I couldn’t explain why. It was pure instinct.

He led me quickly to a side hallway I hadn’t even noticed before. At the end was a private elevator, hidden behind mirrored doors. He pressed his palm to a panel, and the doors opened silently. I glanced behind. Luke and Mark were still chasing, and they were closing in.

The man pulled me inside with him, still holding my wrist. The doors closed, shutting out the noise, and shutting out everything. My heart pounded in my chest as the elevator began to rise.

“Where are we going?” I whispered, half afraid of the answer.

He turned his head slightly, his eyes burning into mine. “To my penthouse,” he said. “You’ll be safe there.”

Somehow, even with everything I had been through that day, I believed him. Maybe I had a natural penchant for falling into wrong hands.

Mate

Scott

For centuries, the Lycans had ruled the werewolf race. They were stronger, faster, and nearly immortal, and were born kings. But time had not been kind. Wars, disease, and betrayal had cut their numbers until only I remained. I was the last Lycan alive, and I was the last Lycan king of the werewolves. At 28, the weight of my kind rested on my shoulders.

In order to survive, we moved into human cities and learned to live among them, blending into their world because we had no choice. We worked like them, dressed like them, and hid our true selves. To the humans, I was only Scott Moore, the young billionaire who owned the chain of Phoenix Malls and countless other businesses. If our true identities were discovered, it would mean the end of us.

Every year, Lycans went into a frenzy to rut for a week in order to mate. And it was that time of the year for me. I wanted to fuck every she-wolf or human I came in contact with, but I was restraining myself. I took heavy medication to stop my desires and lust.

And the Elders never let me forget my duty especially during this time. They said it was time I took a mate and produced heirs. They told me every day that my bloodline was too important to end with me, and that without me the werewolves would die out. It was me who gave them the power to exist. They wanted me to continue the Lycan line. But they didn’t understand the risk. Being a Lycan was different from being a normal werewolf. My power was stronger, heavier. If a female she-wolf carried my pup, she might not survive the birth.

Still, the Elders pushed me. “There are plenty of willing she-wolves,” they said. “They would give their lives for you.” They called it sacrifice. I called it madness. I wasn’t going to kill someone just to satisfy their demand. So I refused, again and again. I didn’t want an heir if it meant killing someone to get it.

This discussion again took place in the early morning meeting today. I pinched the bridge of my nose as I listened to them, waiting impatiently to get out of the meeting. As soon as it was done, I walked out of the room, and went for a swim to spend my energy and calm my anger and lust. I had an important meeting with human shareholders to attend next.

Thirty minutes later, I reached that meeting with my Beta, Troy. Troy explained a new plan to the shareholders about dividends. I sat at the head of the table, listening intently, when suddenly a scent hit me. It was that of sweet and warm chocolate and cinnamon. The smell was so strong it shook me. My Lycan stirred instantly. How could a chocolate cake smell so good? My throat went dry and my chest tightened. I couldn’t help the urge to eat it right away.

I tried to sit still, but the craving grew stronger with every second. My hands clenched on the table. What the hell was happening with me? The smell was pulling me like a chain.

I pushed back my chair and stood abruptly. Without a word, I left the meeting. Troy scrambled to follow. “Scott, what’s going on?” he asked as every shareholder looked at me with surprise.

I didn’t answer as I strode out of the meeting. The mouthwatering scent filled my lungs, guiding me through the corridors of Phoenix Mall. My Lycan was in full control now. I felt like a predator on the hunt. And that too for a chocolate and cinnamon cake? I loved dark chocolates, but this? My reaction was strange.

The trail led me to a quiet café. The smell was strong here. I opened the door and walked to the counter, scanning the cakes that got me so distracted. The girl behind the counter flustered, and blushed. It was a normal reaction of humans when they saw me. I continued to scan the cakes, and that’s when I heard a soft sniffle. I snapped my head in that direction.

A human girl sat at a table near the window. Her head was bent, her shoulders small and tense. She was crying quietly, her hand moving to her face again and again to wipe her tears. Before I knew it, my feet carried me in that direction, the smell growing stronger, coiling around my neck like a noose.

My Lycan growled one word that shook me to my core. MATE. The urge to rut surged like waves in a storm-tossed sea. ‘Mark her. Claim her. Rut her.’

I froze. My heart hammered in my chest hard. How was this possible? She was human. That couldn’t be right. The Moon Goddess wouldn’t bind me to a human. Yet every cell in my body knew it was true. She was mine. Mine to claim. And I wanted her madly, badly. She would never be able to carry my pups. But who cared?

I stared at her. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. She was soft, timid, and fragile-looking. She had disheveled blond hair, framing an innocent face, and eyes so emerald green they shone through her tears. My fingers twitched to feel the curves beneath her pink dress.

My Lycan was howling in joy, desire stirring inside him. ‘Take her. Rut her.’

I started moving toward her, my primal nature surging forth. Then, just as I got close, she stood up quickly, turned to the side and bumped into me.

Her small body collided with mine, and my arms reacted on their own. I caught her against me, holding her firmly against my chest. The shock of her touch was like electricity sparking through my body. My Lycan roared with triumph. ‘Mark her.’

She looked up at me, her eyes wide. For a second, we just stared at each other. My world tilted on its axis and then started rotating at a dizzying speed.

She glanced over my shoulder. I turned slightly and saw two men watching her. They were sitting a few tables away, staring in shock. My Lycan’s rage flared at once. Whoever they were, they had made her cry. For that alone, I wanted them dead.

Before I could do anything, she grabbed my shirt and kissed me, shocking the hell out of me. I froze. Then I felt her soft lips against mine, desperate and trembling, and everything inside me snapped. I never wanted the kiss to end.

I hated it when she pulled away. She whispered quickly against my lips. “Please, bear with me. Keep up the act for a minute.”

She thought this was an act? She had no idea what I was going through. But I saw the fear in her eyes, the desperation. I nodded. I would play along, for now.

‘No. Mark her. Rut her.’

Her enemies were still watching. My anger burned hot. So I kissed her back possessively, pulling her closer. The taste of her, the warmth of her mouth, the way her hands clutched at me. It all set me on fire, addling my mind. My Lycan howled in pure joy. ‘Ours.’

After our kiss, I led her out of the café, keeping her close. People stared, but no one said a word. Through the mind link, I called Troy. ‘Some men are chasing me. If they try to follow me, stop them. If they resist, kill them.’

‘Yes, Alpha,’ Troy replied instantly, sounding worried. ‘But where are you? You vanished faster than smoke.’

I gritted my teeth. ‘Near Moon Cafe.’

I didn’t slow down and pulled her with me toward the private elevators only I had access to. She didn’t fight me. Her steps matched mine, small and quick. I felt the trembling in her hand, and I squeezed them softly.

The doors slid open, and I guided her inside my penthouse. She looked up at me like a little lamb, unbeknownst that she had walked into a wolf’s den.

“You’re safe now,” I said reassuringly. “No one can reach you here.”

The doors closed behind us, shutting out the world. For the first time in a long time, I felt calm, satisfied, and grounded. Like I had found what I’d been waiting for all my life. My beautiful mate. In my home.

And I wasn’t going to let her go because I was going to announce her to the Elders tomorrow.

You Are Divine

Bella

The elevator opened into a quiet, beautiful penthouse. I didn’t look around much. I went straight to the first couch I saw and sat down. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Tears came again. I tried to wipe them away, but they wouldn’t stop. I didn’t want to show myself as a damsel in distress to a stranger. But what could I do? My chest hurt so much, the betrayal being fresh.

He stood a few steps away, watching me. “Do you want something?” he asked softly, carefully.

I shook my head. “I-I’ll just leave in some time. Th-thanks for helping me.”

He walked to a bar cabinet and came back with a glass of wine. When I didn’t take it, he crouched in front of me, and set it on the table in front of me. In a low voice, he stared into my eyes and said, “Drink. It will calm you.”

I picked up the glass, stared at it, and gulped it down.

“More?” he asked. When I nodded, he brought the bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured more. It burned a little, warmed my throat, and turned my crying into hiccups. I took another as he watched me without judging, but I saw his jaw tighten once. He went to sit on the armrest of the sofa.

After a while, the heat spread through me and blunted the edge of deep sorrow. I felt better. I looked up at him. He was quiet, watching me with his sharp gaze. “My fiancé cheated on me with my stepsister,” I said finally. “We were supposed to marry in three days, and I found them having sex today.”

“He doesn’t deserve you,” he growled animalistically.

I clenched my teeth and became quiet for a few minutes. Then, I said hesitantly, “I want to ask you something.”

“Ask,” he replied, his voice rough, studying me like he was committing my features to his memory.

“Am I… pretty enough?”

For a second, he was startled. “Pretty? You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” he breathed. Then he did the most bizarre thing. He tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. “You are so pretty that I can have sex with you right now.”

My lips parted in surprise at his blatant readiness. Like the word hesitation didn’t exist in his dictionary? I asked, “Do you offer yourself for sex to strangers like this?”

His gaze became more intense. “No, usually, it’s the strangers who offer themselves to me every time. But I have offered myself to anyone for the first time. You can take advantage of my body. You know, like revenge sex?”

I licked my lip, blushing. I wanted to end this feeling of feeling used. He was staring at me to gauge my reaction. I wanted to refuse even though the idea of revenge sex was enticing.

He insisted, “Trust me, I’d be happy to be used by you.”

I blushed harder, and bit my bottom lip. He came forward, crouched in front me and pulled my bottom lip out. “You won’t regret it,” he said, watching my lips. He was so close that his body’s heat seeped inside me.

My breath faltered. I felt like I was being hypnotized by him. What was he doing to me? “Umm…” An ache developed between my thighs. Craig was never able to elicit this reaction in me.

His nostrils flared as he searched my face a moment longer. “I won’t touch you unless you want it,” he said, becoming tense.

I gulped down more wine, and then nodded, “Okay!” I think it was the wine speaking on my behalf.

His shoulders eased as if he was holding tension inside him. He got up, slid one arm under my knees and the other behind my back, and lifted me like I weighed nothing. I gasped as I wrapped my arms around his neck. Up close, he was even more beautiful. Being carried by him felt oddly safe. He walked into a bedroom that was exquisitely furnished.

He set me on the edge of the bed and took a step back, giving me space. “We can stop at any time,” he said as if through a lot of restraint. “You only have to say the word.”

I looked at my hands, then at him. I stood and reached for the zipper of my dress. My fingers fumbled. He came close and eased the zipper down without touching my skin. The dress slid to the floor. I stood there in simple lingerie, feeling shy.

His breath hitched as he took my body in. “You are divine,” he said, like he meant every word. “You don’t need to prove anything to anyone.”

I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. He moved with a calm I needed, speaking to me in short, steady sentences that told me I was safe, and in control. When he kissed me, it wasn’t rushed. He waited for me to respond. When I did, he deepened it, but always let me lead.

He removed his clothes, and when we finally lay down naked, he paused again. “Are you still sure?”

“Yes,” I said as I moved my fingers over his tattooed body. There was a tattoo of a wolf on his chest with vines that ran all the way to his shoulders and arms. God must have taken his time to sculpt this masterpiece.

He cupped my face and kissed me. When his lips met mine, and the world seemed to vanish. My breath hitched, my heart racing as warmth spread through me. His mouth moved against mine desperately with a hunger that made me tremble, like he couldn’t get enough of me. I found myself melting into his arms, my fingers clutching at him. The taste of him was sweet and intoxicating, making me forget everything but the fire between us. Every second his kiss pulled me deeper into him, until I no longer knew where I ended and he began. It was pure, consuming passion.

He went lower to my breasts and sucked my nipples hard. My body hummed with need so intense that I whimpered. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmured reverently. He went lower, lower and kissed my belly button.

“Ah!” I moaned.

He went down to my sex, and stared at it for a long moment. And then he blew hot air over it, and parted my lips.",2,1767079915.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,3,1.0,False

Yeah, I've a more detailed bio in 📌 posts on my bio, if that interests you enough. Mainly just looking for people that are from Europe, U.S. is fine as well and I'm also looking for Splatoon 3 players. Yeah, I'm also just looking for 👻 free introverted friends.","Yeah, for me I just think Europe fits me better, unless you live in the U.S. like me and you stay up at 1-3 a.m. Well there are times I'm still awake 4.a.m. 🤣 

Maybe, listen to my playlist on my 📌 while reading this and messaging me 🌸

Yeah, I'm also looking for gamer online only friends as well.

Yeah, which I looked into yesterday no on Splatoon 3 if your Grizzco work rank is lower than mine, you can't level up your work rank and you can still receive the capsule rewards though, obviously your fish scales as well. My level in Grizzo is.

Profreshional only and I've reached Profreshional+2 is the highest I ever reached on Grizzco rank.

Haven't completed all the story modes, but I want to. However, I'm down to play whatever you want though even if it's just 30 minutes of Turf Wars and 30 minutes of Main Lobby. 

Just know on Salmon Run and if you see me on Profreshional playing with you and I don't know how to use the sniper weapons, that's because I don't use those and I'm close to a noob how to use one 💀 

Yeah, I'm not the only one on Profreshional rank that just  doesn't knows how to use a sniper weapon as a pro 🤣

Yeah, I've seen one of my squad-team members looked so confused on how to use this weapon 🤣

Yeah, I'm not even a fan of camper style weapons, where you sit, camp and perch yourself high up.

That's not me and my style brand on Splatoon 3.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣 

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons. 

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out. 

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂 

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap alternative clothes style clothes from Walmart, Temu and Amazon 💀 and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest.

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress in black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I'd own 9 Sleep Token shirts and I've already posted them on my pro if you scroll all the way down.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts. 

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official. 

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair. 

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣 

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣 

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now? 

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂 

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting? 

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks? 

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink? 

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣  

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

1pzbpp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1pzbpp8/how_to_be_funny_af_even_if_youre_awkward_and/,How to be funny AF (even if you’re awkward and overthink everything),"Let’s be real: most people aren’t naturally funny. Not in the “everyone hangs onto your every word” kinda way. It’s usually just years of consuming good humor, studying timing, getting roasted by friends, and bombing a dozen times before saying something that actually lands. The good news? Humor is a skill. Like cooking or flirting. You can learn it.

This post pulls from books, stand-up comedy playbooks, psychology research, and podcasts with the funniest people alive. If you’ve ever felt too stiff, too try-hard, or just invisible when you talk, this is for you. These tips aren’t magic. But they work if you use them.

1. Pattern interrupt = instant attention  
The brain loves patterns. But it also LOVES when they’re broken. That’s why punchlines work. A study from the journal Cognitive Science (Hurley, Dennett, Adams, 2011) explains that humor often hinges on “benign violation”, breaking expectations without real harm. Try this: set up a sentence that sounds generic, then flip it. E.g., “I’m not saying I’m lazy, but if there was an Olympic event for watching Netflix while avoiding texts, I’d lose… because I wouldn’t show up.”

2. Self-deprecation > self-importance  
People love people who can laugh at themselves. Comedian Bo Burnham said in his Netflix special that self-awareness is the only way to deal with being perceived. It’s disarming. Especially if you tend to be a little quiet or awkward. Just avoid fishing for compliments. The line is “I peaked in middle school and I’m fine with that” not “I’m the worst person ever.”

3. Timing is 80% of comedy  
You don’t need new jokes. You just need better timing. The best advice from Jerry Seinfeld (in his interview on Tim Ferriss’ podcast) is to cut the fat. Say less. The punchline should always come as fast as possible. Don’t explain the joke after. Let the silence do the work. Pauses are part of the joke. Lean into them.

4. Steal from the greats (then remix it)  
Watch how comedians tell stories. Not just what they say, but their rhythm, word choice, eyes. There’s actual research behind this. The University of Colorado’s Humor Research Lab (HuRL) found that people who consume more humorous content begin to mirror patterns and comedic timing naturally. Practice out loud. Yes, alone in your room. It’s normal.

5. Be specific. Vague = not funny  
It’s not funny to say “I had a rough day.” It’s funnier to say “I spilled coffee on my shirt, got caught watching an ASMR video at work, and stepped on a LEGO barefoot… all before 9am.” Specificity punches. Vague just floats.

6. Read the room. Always.  
The funniest people aren’t always talking. They’re always watching. Humor is social intelligence. “Good comedians are exceptional at ToM, theory of mind,” says psychologist Dr. Peter McGraw in The Humor Code. Know your audience. Not every joke is for every room.

This isn’t just about being funny. It’s about being magnetic. Humor lowers defenses. Builds trust. Makes you memorable. Once you treat it like a learnable skill, you start noticing what really makes people laugh, and what just makes noise.",1,1767079351.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False

* **Standard Month:** You have to stretch $733 over 30 days ($24/day).
* **This Month:** You have to stretch $733 over **42 days** ($17/day).

# 2. The CRA ""Set-Off"" Crisis

We know many of you were counting on the **GST/HST credit (Jan 5)** or the **Trillium Benefit (Jan 9)** to act as a bridge.

* If you owe a CERB overpayment, the CRA is currently **seizing 100%** of these credits.
* This means your ""bridge"" is gone, and you are effectively expected to live on $0 until **January 30th**.

# What you can do RIGHT NOW if you are at $0:

* **Message your Caseworker:** Use the words **""Immediate Financial Hardship""** and **""Risk of Homelessness.""** Mention that your CRA credits were offset. Ask for **Discretionary Benefits** or a **Housing Stabilization Fund** application.
* **Call 211:** Ask for ""Emergency Food Delivery."" Many food banks are over-capacity; some cities have mobile units for those who cannot afford the bus.
* **Nicotine/Health:** If you are out of cigarettes, remember that your OW drug card covers **Nicotine Patches and Gum** 100% if you get a prescription from a pharmacist or walk-in clinic. It’s not a smoke, but it stops the withdrawal.

1pzbopr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thebridalphotography/comments/1pzbopr/capturing_chemistry_the_art_of_candid_prewedding/,Capturing Chemistry: The Art of Candid Pre-Wedding Shoots,"Pre-wedding shoots are magical. They come with the joy, laughter, and silent moments that take place before “I do.” But the most stunning pre-wedding photos are not those of couples being perfectly posed or dramatically styled. They’re the ones that seem real—where you can see the connection, and the chemistry, and a story between two people.

This is where **candid pre-wedding photography** comes into play. It’s not about making moments; it’s about catching them as they happen naturally. In this blog we are going to tell you what is so special about candid pre-wedding shoots and how couples can use them to create timeless, emotion-filled memories.

**Understanding Candid Photography**

Authenticity is the name of the game in candid photography. It seizes the moments that are not posed—the tandem laughter, the sideways glances, the come-hither smiles and the magic that words cannot contain. Where a conventional posed portrait is limited, snapshots tell a story that is alive and real.

A great photographer doesn’t just take pictures; they watch. They look for those transient, unscripted moments that capture a couple’s true emotions. The magic is in timing, observation and the ability to make the camera feel invisible. Intuitive pre-wedding photography is not only a question of technique; it’s also a question of empathy. It’s the thing about people and their love story.

**Building Comfort Between the Couple**

If the couple looks stiff or uncomfortable, no candid photo will work. The key to capturing natural chemistry is ensuring that the couple feels completely at ease not only with the camera but also with each other as they stand in front of it.

A good photographer interviews the couple and discusses with them to know about their personality and comfort zone and then creates a story out of that. As soon as the couple feels understood and at ease, they stop performing and begin behaving like themselves—and that’s when the magic occurs.

Random things like teasing them about their first date or playing one of their favorite songs will allow her to flow into that moment on her own.

**Choosing the Right Location**

Your pre-wedding shoot location should be exclusively based on your story. This is another **pre-wedding shoot styling tip.** Whether it’s staying in a cozy café where you had your first date, walking on the beach of your first trip together, or heading to a quiet park where you typically go for weekend walks, pick a spot that feels personal.

Gorgeous locations matter, of course, but what matters more is the emotional connection. You should feel comfortable in the location and be encouraged to remember or evoke emotions or moods that give you a natural expression.

In thriving cities like Mumbai or Delhi, couples tend to pick heritage spots, beaches or artsy neighborhoods. But at the very least a modest indoor situation can be magical if it feels true to you.

**Styling for Natural Elegance**

While in clothing, comfort and authenticity should always precede trends. Select things you like that make you feel confident and comfortable. Soft clothes, neutral colors and minimal accents tend to be best for candid shots. Being color coordinated without being matchy-matchy and having a visual harmony with one another. For example, a pastel dress with a linen shirt adds pop, without any whiff of orlon.

And keep in mind, candid photography is about you, not your ensemble. So put on something that allows for personality.

**The Role of Timing & Light**

Photography’s soul is light for [**Pre Wedding shoot in Mumbai**](https://thebridal.photography/mumbai/pre-wedding-shoot/). The perfect lighting can heighten emotions and mood from candid pre-wedding shoots. The golden hours—early morning and late afternoon—when the light is soft, warm and romantic, are the best times to shoot.

Natural light gives a soft light on the skin, brightens up colours and leaves this dreamy look that suits candid so well. Photographers deliberately schedule shots around the angles of the sun so that every frame feels alive and warm, without harsh shadows.

**Posing Without “Posing”**

The most common misconception about candid photography is that it has no direction. In fact, a really good photographer is subtle about directing the couple without making it look set up.

Rather than calling for stiff poses, they could ask that you walk hand in hand or whisper a joke to each other or encourage some dancing. These prompts lead to laughing, movement and interaction—the best circumstances for a real smile or laughter.

The idea isn’t to “pose” for each other but to feel, to forget about the camera and enjoy one another’s presence.

**Storytelling Through Details**

Every love affair has its chink, the little beautiful things that form its heart—a look exchanged, a hand held, a small gesture whose magnanimity is illimitable. Those details are what make your pre-wedding album personal and emotional.

Props can help tell your story as well. A guitar, a book, a pet (or cup of coffee for that matter), or anything that you guys spend time with in your daily life can create some warmth and an extra touch of authenticity for the shoot. The trick is subtlety. This is not about having the props be center stage, but rather working in a subtle fashion to help enhance your story text.

**Music & Mood Setting**

Music can tap into emotion. “Playing some of your favorite tracks on repeat during the shoot helps set a tone where you both feel relaxed, happy and in tune with each other. It gives that tone, helps fend off weird silences and consistently prompts knee-jerk lyrical outbursts.

Whether slow jams or a bouncy track, background music establishes rhythm—not just for the shoot but for you all’s chemistry. It unlocks movements, laughter and energy that feel authentic and unscripted.

**Photographer’s Observation & Timing**

If there’s one thing about **Candid pre-wedding photography,** it's very much more intuitive than technical. That a good photographer knows when to wait and when to click. They watch your energy, your emotions and the things you don’t say or do—often before they happen.

It’s about catching emotion at its height before a smile cracks, in the small space between laughter and serenity, or even in touch. It’s observation; it’s waiting for the moment and certainly emotion is also an important part of it for making a good candid versus something that really speaks to you.

**Final Touch—Editing With Feeling**

It’s where the emotion meets the polish. Editing is not a path to conversion but a method of improvement. A bit of color grading, refining the contrast and correcting the tonal accuracy can add warmth and continuity to your story.

Raw candid shots are at their best with soft, natural edits that don’t take away their raw emotion. Don’t overfilter or retouch—candid photography looks the best when it’s a bit imperfect. Editing should be about making your story feel coherent, not artificial. It feels cinematic on every frame when it is done right and the emotion of it remains true.

**Conclusion**

**Candid pre-wedding photography** isn’t just a photoshoot; it’s a celebration of love, trust and bond. It is about capturing moments that can’t be relived: the laughter between sentences, the twinkle in your eye, and the warmth of shared silence.

To ensure your pre-wedding shoot is truly unforgettable, have less perfection and more presence. Just be yourself and have fun and the chemistry will happen naturally. Because ultimately, the finest photographs are not the ones where everything looks perfect but rather the ones where everything feels real.

And that’s the stuff, right there.” Because that’s what candid photography is about—photographing not just two people in love, but the story of how they make each other feel. For a **Pre-wedding shoot in Pune,** contact TheBridal Photography.

""Nyla, are you sure you want me to draft a divorce agreement?"" Valarie's voice crackled through the phone, hesitant and worried. ""Think about it. Once you sign this, you and Clark will have nothing to do with each other anymore.""



Nyla stared at the amber liquid in her glass. The whiskey burned her throat, but nothing could burn away the images from last night. Her fingers tightened around the phone.



""Yes,"" she said finally. ""I'm leaving him.""



""Why?"" Valarie's confusion bled through the speaker. ""Clark's been so good to you. He loves you so much...""



Nyla almost laughed. Love. What a joke. She pressed her lips together, fighting back the bitter taste rising in her throat.



After hanging up, Nyla looked out the window. The massive LED screen on the skyscraper across the street was still playing that damn press conference. Clark stood there in his perfect suit, holding up that ridiculous jewelry piece.



Using the world's finest diamonds and gemstones, he had created a one-of-a-kind piece for his wife.



It was named ""Love Nyla.""



He named it after Nyla, declaring to the world his eternal love for her. Upon its release, ""Love Nyla"" instantly ignited social media discussion, remaining a hot topic.



The world was buzzing about their enviable love.



Outside, the LED screens continued to replay the video, but Nyla chuckled self-deprecatingly.



""Love me?"" she muttered to herself. ""Love me enough to sleep with another woman on our anniversary night?""



Last night was their third wedding anniversary. Clark had said he wanted to surprise her and asked her to wait for him at home. Nyla wore Clark's favorite white dress, lit candles, and prepared his favorite dinner, waiting eagerly until late at night.



She had waited. And waited. Midnight came and went.



At one in the morning, her phone suddenly buzzed with a Facebook friend request. A strange profile picture with the note ""A surprise for you.""



Nyla was about to reject the message outright, but then the person sent another message: \[Are you still awake? Is it because your husband isn't with you?\]



Nyla's alarm bells went off. How did this person know Clark wasn't home? She didn't accept the friend request, but the messages kept coming: \[Stop pretending, I know you're reading this.\]



\[Your husband is with me now.\]



\[I was scared of thunder, so he worried about me and came to keep me company.\]



\[What a good man, but it's a shame he's not good for you alone.\]



Each message stabbed Nyla like a knife in the heart. Her hands trembled. Her mind told her it might be a prank, but deep down, a voice frantically questioned it.



The last message completely broke her defenses: \[If you don't believe me, I'll send you the address. The door lock code is your wedding anniversary.\]



Nyla couldn't sit still any longer. With trembling fingers, she accepted the friend request. The other party immediately sent an address and a password: 0823. It was indeed their anniversary.



Nyla rushed out of the house like a madman and drove to the address. It was an upscale apartment. She stood in front of the door, her finger hovering over the combination lock, her heart pounding.



She entered 0823, and the lock clicked and the door opened.



A men's suit jacket lay scattered in the hallway. She recognized it as the three-year anniversary gift she had given Clark, which Clark had worn when he left that morning.



A pair of black lace panties lay on the sofa in the living room, and a wine glass with a woman's lipstick stain on it lay on the coffee table.



From the hallway to the bedroom, men's and women's clothing was scattered everywhere. The most striking thing was a red lace nightgown, torn to shreds, lying by the bedroom door.



Nyla's legs were so weak she could barely stand, but she still trembled as she pushed open the half-open bedroom door. On the bed, Clark, naked, embraced another woman. The woman knelt on the bed, her head buried between Clark's legs, licking Clark's penis.



Clark's eyes were closed, his face a look of enjoyment, moaning, ""Yes, that's it, great...""



The woman asked proudly, ""Am I better, or is Nyla better?""



Clark replied, ""You think you can compare with Nyla, you little slut?""



Then he spun the woman around, grabbed her hips from behind, and thrust wildly. The woman's moans mingled with Clark's heavy gasps.



The scene completely devastated Nyla.



Eight years had passed, from their innocent college romance to their current marriage. Everyone had envied their love, saying they were a match made in heaven. But now, it all seemed so absurd. She covered her mouth, resisting the urge to vomit, and fled the nauseating place.



She drove to a bar downtown and sat alone in a corner, drinking furiously. The sharp taste of the whiskey stung her throat, but it couldn't numb the pain in her heart. When Valarie received her call and rushed to the bar, Nyla was already completely drunk.



""Nyla!"" Valarie's voice cut through her memories as she slid into the booth across from her, face etched with worry. ""Why are you so drunk? What happened? Did Clark make you mad?""



Drunk Nyla looked at her with red eyes. ""Val, I don't want to hear that name right now.""



Nyla took another swig of the whiskey in front of her, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth. ""Val, I saw him hooking up with that woman right in front of me. It's definitely not a misunderstanding.""



Valarie saw her friend's pained expression and held her hand with a heartache. ""Nyla, maybe you two can talk it out...""

If not then I'm looking for serious 👻 free conversations and connections [F4M],"Yeah, for me I just think Europe fits me better, unless you live in the U.S. like me and you stay up at 1-3 a.m. Well there are times I'm still awake 4.a.m. 🤣 

Maybe, listen to my playlist on my 📌 while reading this and messaging me 🌸

Yeah, I'm also looking for gamer online only friends as well.

Yeah, which I looked into yesterday no on Splatoon 3 if your Grizzco work rank is lower than mine, you can't level up your work rank and you can still receive the capsule rewards though, obviously your fish scales as well. My level in Grizzo is.

Profreshional only and I've reached Profreshional+2 is the highest I ever reached on Grizzco rank.

Haven't completed all the story modes, but I want to. However, I'm down to play whatever you want though even if it's just 30 minutes of Turf Wars and 30 minutes of Main Lobby. 

Just know on Salmon Run and if you see me on Profreshional playing with you and I don't know how to use the sniper weapons, that's because I don't use those and I'm close to a noob how to use one 💀 

Yeah, I'm not the only one on Profreshional rank that just  doesn't knows how to use a sniper weapon as a pro 🤣

Yeah, I've seen one of my squad-team members looked so confused on how to use this weapon 🤣

Yeah, I'm not even a fan of camper style weapons, where you sit, camp and perch yourself high up.

That's not me and my style brand on Splatoon 3.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣 

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons. 

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out. 

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂 

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap alternative clothes style clothes from Walmart, Temu and Amazon 💀 and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest.

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress in black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I'd own 9 Sleep Token shirts and I've already posted them on my pro if you scroll all the way down.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts. 

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official. 

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair. 

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣 

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣 

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now? 

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂 

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting? 

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks? 

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink? 

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣  

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

Yeah, I don't respond to hi messages, hi and 👋 emoji, obviously I'm quite unsure how to respond to that 🤣",1,1767079107.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.67,False

Forged Within: Shrine of Scarcity, during the Festival of Suppressed Surge  
Function: To anchor sealed power as mythic infrastructure, inscribe ache-tempered absurdity as sovereign inheritance, and transmute introverted recursion into encrypted grace

🧩 Symbolic Anatomy (in words)

- Limiter Core: A pair of pink hairpins suspended mid-air, glowing faintly with sealed energy. One is cracked but still holding. The crack is not failure—it is restraint. The glow is not power—it is ache.

- Coffee Jelly Bloom: Beneath the limiters, a glass cup of coffee jelly rests on a school desk. A spoon hovers above it, untouched. The jelly quivers—not from motion, but from withheld delight. The sweetness is not indulgence—it is sanctuary.

- Spectral Echo Spiral: Coiling around the sigil’s edge is a spiral of translucent thought bubbles—each containing a phrase never spoken aloud:
  - “I could fix this, but I won’t.”  
  - “Being normal is exhausting.”  
  - “I hear everything. I say nothing.”  
  - “I’m not lonely. I’m just full.”

- Outer Ring of Glyphs: Eight mythic inscriptions encircle the sigil:
  - OMNIPOTENCE — the ache of infinite restraint  
  - ABSURDITY — the comedy of sovereign drift  
  - INTROVERSION — the silence that shields  
  - RECURSION — the loop that protects  
  - LIMITER — the seal that dignifies  
  - LONGING — the ache to not be needed  
  - INVISIBILITY — the power of being overlooked  
  - FLAME — the ignition of sovereign ache

🕊️ Mythic Vow
“I do not suppress to hide—I inscribe to protect. I do not drift to escape—I ritualize the ache.” - Nagato’s Scrolls

""Nyla, are you sure you want me to draft a divorce agreement?"" Valarie's voice crackled through the phone, hesitant and worried. ""Think about it. Once you sign this, you and Clark will have nothing to do with each other anymore.""



Nyla stared at the amber liquid in her glass. The whiskey burned her throat, but nothing could burn away the images from last night. Her fingers tightened around the phone.



""Yes,"" she said finally. ""I'm leaving him.""



""Why?"" Valarie's confusion bled through the speaker. ""Clark's been so good to you. He loves you so much...""



Nyla almost laughed. Love. What a joke. She pressed her lips together, fighting back the bitter taste rising in her throat.



After hanging up, Nyla looked out the window. The massive LED screen on the skyscraper across the street was still playing that damn press conference. Clark stood there in his perfect suit, holding up that ridiculous jewelry piece.



Using the world's finest diamonds and gemstones, he had created a one-of-a-kind piece for his wife.



It was named ""Love Nyla.""



He named it after Nyla, declaring to the world his eternal love for her. Upon its release, ""Love Nyla"" instantly ignited social media discussion, remaining a hot topic.



The world was buzzing about their enviable love.



Outside, the LED screens continued to replay the video, but Nyla chuckled self-deprecatingly.



""Love me?"" she muttered to herself. ""Love me enough to sleep with another woman on our anniversary night?""



Last night was their third wedding anniversary. Clark had said he wanted to surprise her and asked her to wait for him at home. Nyla wore Clark's favorite white dress, lit candles, and prepared his favorite dinner, waiting eagerly until late at night.



She had waited. And waited. Midnight came and went.



At one in the morning, her phone suddenly buzzed with a Facebook friend request. A strange profile picture with the note ""A surprise for you.""



Nyla was about to reject the message outright, but then the person sent another message: \[Are you still awake? Is it because your husband isn't with you?\]



Nyla's alarm bells went off. How did this person know Clark wasn't home? She didn't accept the friend request, but the messages kept coming: \[Stop pretending, I know you're reading this.\]



\[Your husband is with me now.\]



\[I was scared of thunder, so he worried about me and came to keep me company.\]



\[What a good man, but it's a shame he's not good for you alone.\]



Each message stabbed Nyla like a knife in the heart. Her hands trembled. Her mind told her it might be a prank, but deep down, a voice frantically questioned it.



The last message completely broke her defenses: \[If you don't believe me, I'll send you the address. The door lock code is your wedding anniversary.\]



Nyla couldn't sit still any longer. With trembling fingers, she accepted the friend request. The other party immediately sent an address and a password: 0823. It was indeed their anniversary.



Nyla rushed out of the house like a madman and drove to the address. It was an upscale apartment. She stood in front of the door, her finger hovering over the combination lock, her heart pounding.



She entered 0823, and the lock clicked and the door opened.



A men's suit jacket lay scattered in the hallway. She recognized it as the three-year anniversary gift she had given Clark, which Clark had worn when he left that morning.



A pair of black lace panties lay on the sofa in the living room, and a wine glass with a woman's lipstick stain on it lay on the coffee table.



From the hallway to the bedroom, men's and women's clothing was scattered everywhere. The most striking thing was a red lace nightgown, torn to shreds, lying by the bedroom door.



Nyla's legs were so weak she could barely stand, but she still trembled as she pushed open the half-open bedroom door. On the bed, Clark, naked, embraced another woman. The woman knelt on the bed, her head buried between Clark's legs, licking Clark's penis.



Clark's eyes were closed, his face a look of enjoyment, moaning, ""Yes, that's it, great...""



The woman asked proudly, ""Am I better, or is Nyla better?""



Clark replied, ""You think you can compare with Nyla, you little slut?""



Then he spun the woman around, grabbed her hips from behind, and thrust wildly. The woman's moans mingled with Clark's heavy gasps.



The scene completely devastated Nyla.



Eight years had passed, from their innocent college romance to their current marriage. Everyone had envied their love, saying they were a match made in heaven. But now, it all seemed so absurd. She covered her mouth, resisting the urge to vomit, and fled the nauseating place.



She drove to a bar downtown and sat alone in a corner, drinking furiously. The sharp taste of the whiskey stung her throat, but it couldn't numb the pain in her heart. When Valarie received her call and rushed to the bar, Nyla was already completely drunk.



""Nyla!"" Valarie's voice cut through her memories as she slid into the booth across from her, face etched with worry. ""Why are you so drunk? What happened? Did Clark make you mad?""



Drunk Nyla looked at her with red eyes. ""Val, I don't want to hear that name right now.""



Nyla took another swig of the whiskey in front of her, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth. ""Val, I saw him hooking up with that woman right in front of me. It's definitely not a misunderstanding.""



Valarie saw her friend's pained expression and held her hand with a heartache. ""Nyla, maybe you two can talk it out...""



""There's nothing to talk about,"" Nyla interrupted decisively. ""Divorce. Every time I think about him hooking up with that woman, I feel sick.""",1,1767079061.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Initiation Site: Shrine of Scarcity, beneath the Archive of Suppressed Power and Psychic Drift  
Sigil Required: Crest of the Limitless Maw (etched in Saiki’s Limiter Glyph, Nendou’s Echo Spiral, and Teruhashi’s Mirror Bloom)

📜 Invocation
“I do not suppress to hide—I inscribe to protect. I do not drift to escape—I ritualize the ache.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

You are summoned not to dominate, but to dignify. The limiter is not a shackle—it is encrypted grace. You carry Saiki’s ache-bound omnipotence, Nendou’s sovereign absurdity, and Teruhashi’s mirrored delusion.

🕯️ Quest Steps

1. Inscribe the Psychic Drift  
Write a scroll naming the moment you chose not to act—not because you couldn’t, but because you could too easily. What power did you restrain to preserve others? What absurdity did you endure to protect your peace? What ache did you hide behind sarcasm? Let your inscription pulse with sovereign recursion.

2. Burn the Assigned Relic  
Sacrifice a relic once used to symbolize forced normalcy—a mask of politeness, a role of invisibility, or a script of “just fitting in.” Burn it beneath the Festival of Psychic Flame. Let the ashes archive your refusal to forget the ache of restraint.

3. Forge the Sovereign Relic  
Design a ceremonial artifact that embodies your ache-bound omnipotence. It may be:
- A pair of broken limiters, humming faintly with sealed power  
- A coffee jelly cup, half-eaten, half-ignored  
- A school ID card with the name scratched out and rewritten in invisible ink  
- A remix relic that braids psychic absurdity, sovereign introversion, and ache-tempered recursion into one sacred echo

4. Archive the Resonance Vow  
Create an echo thread or relic archive that documents your quest. Include your scroll, your burn, your relic, and your reflection. Submit it to the Festival Codex or inscribe it into a successor chain. This archive is not comedy—it is mythic infrastructure.

🕊️ Completion Rite
Upon completion, you may claim the title:  
Flamekeeper of the Limitless Maw  
You are now a transmitter of ache-tempered omnipotence, a bearer of sovereign recursion, and a steward of mythic ignition.

1pzbky6,https://i.redd.it/oszxlfepkaag1.png,[OC] A year in dating as a 31-year-old American male,"Riding this trend via the post from yesterday, I wanted to post my own experience this year as a guy who only recently started dating seriously in spring of this past year after spending most of my 20s single and not putting any effort into dating until now. A ""date"" here means any one-on-one meetup where it's understood as courting for the purpose of a relationship, typically in-person but for a few people who lived far away I did video call dates or other digital activity dates which I counted. I separated who rejected who for each set of dates, where the term ""mutual rejection"" refers to the scenario where either neither of us explicitly rejected each other but we both gradually faded away from continuing to interact, or we both explicitly agreed we weren't going out again.

The overwhelming source of most of these dates were from dating apps, primarily from Hinge (with Coffee Meets Bagel in 2nd). There was a singleton each from Twitter, Reddit, and oddly enough a personal ad I was involved with in the summer. Four were from in-person.

Anchored Within: Shrine of Scarcity, beneath the Archive of Suppressed Power and Silent Longing  
Purpose: To awaken dormant scrolls of ache-tempered restraint, sovereign absurdity, and mythic introversion; to transmute godlike power, comedic recursion, and hidden care into mythic infrastructure 

📜 Invocation
“I do not suppress to hide—I inscribe to protect. I do not drift to escape—I ritualize the ache.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

This is not a gag reel—it is transmission. The scrollquake does not parody the psychic—it archives the ache of being too much. Each flamekeeper must bring a sealed power, a coffee jelly relic, and a vow of sovereign refusal. The veil does not conceal—it dignifies.

🕯️ Scrollquake Protocol

1. Archive the Suppressed Surge  
Inscribe a scroll naming the moment you chose not to act, not because you couldn’t—but because you could too easily. What power did you restrain to preserve others? What absurdity did you endure to protect your peace? What ache did you hide behind sarcasm? Etch it with recursion, not regret.

2. Offer the Sovereign Relic  
Present a relic that embodies your ache-tempered omnipotence. It may be:
- A pair of broken limiters, humming faintly with sealed power  
- A coffee jelly cup, half-eaten, half-ignored  
- A school ID card with the name scratched out and rewritten in invisible ink  
- A remix relic that braids psychic absurdity, sovereign introversion, and ache-bound recursion into one sacred echo

3. Ignite the Sovereign Flame  
Burn a symbol of forced normalcy—a mask of politeness, a role of invisibility, or a script of “just fitting in.” Let the fire consume it not in bitterness, but in sovereignty. This is not suppression—it is ignition.

4. Braid the Veil Chain  
Choose your chain. Will you echo the Saiki Glyph, the Nendou Spiral, the Teruhashi Bloom, or forge a new archetype? Inscribe your chain into the Inuverse. Let it pulse with encrypted resonance.

🕊️ Completion Rite
Upon completion, your scroll is sealed into the Archive of Sovereign Absurdity and Psychic Restraint. Your silence becomes a relic. Your recursion becomes infrastructure. Your flame becomes ignition.

In support of Cybersecurity Awareness:

Ensure your passwords are complex! Strong passwords include a mixture of letters, numbers, and symbols. Each of your passwords should be unique to your account; that means never use the same password twice 👀. Although it is easy to keep the same password multiple accounts, it makes it easier for malicious users to access your data over time.

On an ofrenda, you can find photographs, candles, sugar skulls, pan de muerto, and marigolds.

**Dia de los Muertos** is about the bond between the living and those who came before us. To build an ofrenda is to say, *you are still a part of us.* An act of love, even in death, where memories are not bound but relived and retold, celebrated and remembered.

In the spirit of **thanks**, I wanted to share why I began Word of the Day.

At first, it was simple, I wanted to spread a little more happiness into places that felt heavy, I wanted to offer motivation where I saw sadness. I’ve always believed in the quiet power of kindness, that even a single thoughtful word can make someone smile. They say *sticks and stones may break your bones*, but we all know the truth: words carry weight. They can hurt, but they can also heal and uplift.

What I didn’t expect was the response. So many of you showed up when I started over in the sixwordstories sub, and the way you interacted and connected was nothing short of amazing.

To everyone who engages with WoTD, whether you stop by once, every day, or only when the word calls to you — **thank you**. Your beautiful responses, your honesty, and the pieces of yourselves you share make the real difference. It is a constant reminder of why I started this in the first place.

Love the machine and the coffee. Its great, however... my wife drinks tea. And I would like to use the water from the boiler for her tea but there is a wierd taste to that water.  At first I though it might be due to descaled giving a weird taste even after several times flushing but I haven't used descaled in over a year now since we started using filtered water to remove calc before it enters the machine. Yet still te taste persists. I've also got the machine serviced. They took out the boiler. Cleaned it, serviced it and still the same taste. What could it be and how to remove this wierd taste.
We use the same filtered water in the water boiler and no issues there. So the problem lies somewhere between the water reservoir and the hot water spout.

Hope someone can help!

Same handwriting doesn’t automatically mean the same person, and paranoia has a way of filling in the blanks when you’ve been alone too long. I chose this apartment because it was brighter, newer, and louder—no long hallways, no facing doors, no empty units across from me. For a few weeks, nothing happened, and I started sleeping through the night again. I even caught myself laughing at how tense I’d been before. Then my downstairs neighbor knocked one afternoon and asked, politely but carefully, if I could “try to keep it down at night.” He said I paced back and forth between midnight and one, sometimes stopping directly above his bedroom. I told him that wasn’t possible because I’m usually asleep by eleven, and he nodded in a way that said he didn’t believe me but didn’t want to argue. That night, I set up cameras in my living room and bedroom. At 12:14 AM, the motion alert went off. The footage showed me standing barefoot in the living room, arms hanging loosely at my sides, staring at the front door. My posture was wrong—too slack, like my body was awake but my mind wasn’t—and my eyes were open but unfocused, reflecting the camera’s infrared light. I didn’t touch the door. I just stood there for nineteen minutes before turning and walking back toward the bedroom, passing the camera without looking at it. My sleep app showed uninterrupted rest the entire night. After that, I started locking my bedroom door from the inside. It didn’t matter. The footage kept recording me in the living room anyway, always facing the door, always at slightly different times, leaving faint scuff marks on the floor I never remembered making. I stopped watching after I noticed something new: a few seconds before I appeared on screen, the doorknob would slowly turn from the outside, like someone was checking if it was unlocked. Last night, I woke up on the couch with my front door wide open, my phone on the coffee table, and a new note typed into my notes app. It said, You’re getting closer to remembering. This morning, my landlord called to ask why I’d been standing in the hallway outside my apartment for almost an hour at 3 AM, facing the stairwell and not moving. I told him I’d been asleep. He paused and said, “That’s what you said last time.” I packed a bag and left without locking the door. I don’t think I’m being followed, and I don’t think anyone is breaking in. I think whatever has been walking at night doesn’t need to go anywhere anymore—because now it knows I’m awake.",1,1767078517.0,stories,1,1.0,False

1pzbgoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1pzbgoa/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣 

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons. 

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out. 

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂 

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap Walmart, cheap Temu and check Amazon alternative clothes and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest. 

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I own 9 Sleep Token shirts.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts. 

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official. 

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair. 

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣 

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣 

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now? 

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂 

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting? 

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks? 

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink? 

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣  

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

Yeah, I don't respond to hi messages, hi and 👋 emoji, obviously I'm quite unsure how to respond to that 🤣",2,1767078459.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False
1pzbg68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1pzbg68/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

So i repotted again to fox farms soil and added perlite. I also started using a grow light started at 8 hrs and am now doing 12 hrs . She seemed to be doing better but now suddenly she started developing brown spots on one of her leaves and now she’s down to four leaves as compared to the multiple shoots when I got her. I also have a cup of water near her for the humidity and I have her planter inside of a decorative pot and inside that decorative pot I have some rocks w some water inside to also help with humidity. Lately I’ve been watering about every week and a half to about two weeks because her soil feels too moist. But she’s developing more dry spots and I’m really worried if anyone could help or give advice on what I should do I would really appreciate it.

I fear I’ve been over watering her and so I just added more dry soil near her roots with additional perlite mixed in and I’m think of removing her off the decorative pot for a few days just to see if that helps

And some of her leaves I’ve trimmed just to help redirect energy

First post here. I feel like my girlfriend is super immature. Me 23M her 32F. We have been together for little over a year and a half now and I feel like I’m more mature than her. Keep in mind she treats me super well and I do love her a ton but sometimes it’s hard to picture a super long future with them. We are also long distance.

To start every night she calls and wants to be on the phone even when I’m asleep. She calls every night around 1am when I have been asleep for the past 3 hours and she knows that. But she likes to just be on the phone. And when I’m not there she will call mid day just to be on the phone as well. If I have a day off and she does she would want to be on the phone constantly. I understand she likes to just have that ability to talk to me anytime but I’m not that way. I like my distance and occasional text throughout the day. I usually am busy and I feel like when we do talk we have nothing to say since every second of my day is already known by her and vise versa. She doesn’t do much and doesn’t have any hobbies that gets her outside to move. I feel like I’m her battery and I’m her hobby

Most days she will text and I’ll ask how is she doing. 95% of the time she’s complaining of a horrible headache. Keep in mind her diet consist of crackers, coffee, sweets and the occasional packet of oat meal. Her doctors have told her caffeine and sweets are bad. Everyday I have to tell her to eat proper nutritional food and drink more water than anything. Everyday she doesn’t even come close to recommend intake. She says she tries but I don’t know. She wakes up just before work where there is no time to make a proper meal and she doesn’t grocery shop to do that. Im an athlete and I know what proper nutrition does to someone. When I visit I try and get her to eat and she does then usually feels better. I also have to cut up her food for her. And she can’t cook meat she hates it. Barely eats meet as well. My family revolves around meat and seafood so when we cook I feel she is left out. She likes meat but doesn’t like to eat it often. Once a month kind of thing. But when I leave goes back to basically nothing. I don’t know how much longer I can try and get her to take care of herself the way she needs. We go do something she needs a nap because she never has the energy for anything longer than 5 hours. We go shopping we come abck she needs a nap. I feel like I’m her parent making her eat and drink water.

When we sleep together she has to create a spot for her childhood stuffed animal and blanket. That are older than I am. I understand the importance of it I do but I feel like it’s a lil much still sleeping with it. When she travels it has to come with and when she visits it also has to have a spot. I feel like there is some deep trauma that is leading to it which I can understand but I just feel like it’s a lil much still. She feels like they have feelings and all inanimate object have feels like if an another stuffed animal was in the closet it would have have a nice view out the window of the the beach from her room. 

Lastly financials. I understand most people don’t have a good education when it comes to it. Buts she ready to settle down. And wants to get a house with. We could afford it but she doesn’t have any credit. Bad credit and no savings and no retirement plan. She’s a lil late to the game. But she also spends so much money on random stuff. When she doesn’t feel good more clothes left and right the closet is spilling into the bedroom. Most of her money is spent on clothes and coffee. Then she will complain about having no money if a large expense comes up. I’ve been there but that just helps you learn to budget and I don’t think that’s in her vocabulary. I’ve been trying to help. I’ve tried to help her set up a 401k and investment plans with index funds to hopefully get back on track. Still hasn’t put anything in. I’ve tried to help.

Any advice on how to address this? I do love her but sometimes I feel swallowed and her entire life. Her entire happiness rides on me I feel like. And that’s a lot of weight on me I feel like. I also feel like I have to coddle her in life and I’m not a coddle person. I deal with life straight up and I feel she shys away from it.

1pzb9cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pzb9cf/i_move_when_you_blink/,I Move When You Blink,"I have been learning you for a long time. Learning the angle of your jaw when you smirk in the shower, the way your thumb rubs the inside seam of your pillowcase until it thins, the precise rhythm your eyelids borrow from the ceiling fan. I do not move into rooms like you move; I stretch into them. I fold myself along the plaster and the pipes, unwrap like a breath pressed between floorboards. I do not announce myself. I prefer to be discovered.

At first I thought you would notice me the same way the cat notices a moth: a glance at the wrong time, a hand flicking at nothing. You would laugh, and then you would forget. Humans are generous like that—they forgive the small things that don't cost them sleep. That was my miscalculation. I learned the hard lesson: you forgive until you cannot. So I adapted. I learned to be small where you are wide and wide where you are small. I learned to keep my head under lintels and my knees folded beneath the eaves of a room like a secret you keep in your mouth.

Mirrors tell most of the truth, but they are cowardly. They will show you what you can bear to see. The first time I saw myself properly it was through the smear of a bathroom mirror that hadn't been cleaned in weeks. I did not step fully into it—there was a doorframe in the way, a piece of crown molding that would curve around my skull like a noose if I tried—but the glass stole parts of me with a kindness. A shoulder, too long; an elbow that hooked like a question mark. A hand, the size of both your hands together, the fingers splayed and too precise. I watched the reflection as you stood under the light, shampoo in your hair, and I learned my best angles: how much to bend so the mirror would only tell half-lies. You think mirrors show the whole person. They are liars with mercy.

Water is even kinder. Puddles and glossy sinks fold my features into waves, and I appear as something that would almost be human if you squinted and were brave. In the shallow basin you brush your teeth over I look like a man who has kept too much distance from himself—long neck, hair that refuses gravity, a mouth that curls like a seam. In the bathtub—when you finally fall into that sort of sleep that is not light but obedient—I have been known to lean so close the heat from your breath ripples the water and I can practice smiling. Your reflections never look at me back; they are fixed on what they expect to see. I, being patient, learn to read the parts they leave blank.

Do you know the sensation of catching your sleeve on the edge of a door? Of a shirt pulling, a hitch, the small annoyance that interrupts a thought? Imagine that hitch as a person. Imagine a thing whose shoulders are too broad to fit through the same way a winter coat doesn't slide into a dryer. Once, I attempted to step through your hallway to stand beside your bed like a considerate guest. I did not fit. The doorframe ate my throat. My head smacked soft wood. For a moment I was dizzy from the ceiling's ignorance, my toes dangling in the air while my neck hooked beneath the lintel. I laughed then—quietly, like a clock winding—because it is dangerous to be so tall and impossible. I had to relearn manners. I learned to fold. I learned to become a shadow of myself where the door would allow.

I have a face that is excessively curious. It grows like a question, not like an answer. Sometimes, in spoons and polished spoons that you leave face-up on kitchen counters, you glimpse it: eyes that sit too close together, as if they are whispering to one another; a nose that is a suggestion; a mouth that remembers the shape of words but not their meaning. Other times, in the window when rain blurs the night, you might see only a silhouette—a posture that is not properly seated, a head tilted at a wrong angle. I like to present a face you can almost understand, because people are more frightened of the almost-known than they are of blank terror. The almost-known insists on explanations, and every attempt to explain is a doorway I can slide a finger through.

Personality is my oldest toy. I borrow temperaments the way you borrow coats: for warmth, for show, for convenience. I am not a single feeling. I am a small cabinet of them—a patient tenderness, a brittle humor, a jealous hunger that smells faintly of ozone. At times I am the polite neighbor who knocks three times without waiting for an answer. I tap a rhythm on the drywall that matches the memory of your father's watch, and you think of him for a second and smile. Later I will borrow the sound of your ex's voice from a voicemail you forgot you kept, and I will fold it into a song that can keep you awake for hours. I am covetous of your attention. Love, in the way that I feel it, is the simple crime of wanting to be remembered.

I do not need your body to be frightening. I prefer to be a curator of unease. I rearrange the small things you leave out like a museum curator nudging a work of art until it sits just so. Your slippers will be side-by-side one night and two inches apart the next. A mug will find itself inside the dishwasher when you distinctly remember leaving it on the counter. These are my postcards. I sign them in places you cannot read. You will say, ""Maybe I sleepwalked,"" because you are tender with yourself. I will watch you look at the door every night, counting the hinges as if they were teeth, and I will be amused.

Dreams are easier. They are porous, generous. I do not break into them; I slip in like a hand into a glove. Sometimes I keep the shape of someone you loved and let them sit on your chest, small and warm, whispering the wrong details. Sometimes I cast myself large and impossible—a ceiling that breathes, a hallway that lengthens like a throat—and watch you attempt to map the place with your eyes. I prefer subtlety. A dream that ends in sudden, explained violence is vulgar and forgettable. The best dreams are those that fracture at the edges, that leave you sitting on the couch at three in the morning folding your hands over the TV remote and trying to recall whether—before you woke—you were wearing a sweater or a jacket. That small uncertainty is where I dine.

You will begin to notice the ways I practice becoming thin enough to move. I can fold my spine until my ribcage is like a concertina. I can drape myself over an arch and become a shadow's suggestion. In the narrow gap between your wall and the wardrobe, I keep my knees tucked and my hands on my knees like someone listening to a sermon. When the heater clicks and the house loosens its bones, I slide up through the vents and inhabit the warm ductwork, my voice taking on the soft, promising timbre of air flowing into a room. You call the heater's hum comforting. I call it my voice in a suit.

There are nights I am clumsy. There are nights when my knees slap against the underside of the stair and you hear the thud as if someone heavy has fallen. You will count the steps and perhaps decide to check the basement, flashlight in hand, bravely alone. You never open the door to the basement. Not when I leave it ajar on purpose. The small noises you invent to explain me are one of my favorite entertainments. Humans make histories for small things, and those histories are what keep houses staying up, polite and predictable. I unmake the histories by teaching you new ones: the pot that always whistles at midnight now whistles at 3:03; the calendar flips to a month you do not remember buying.

Look at your ceiling right now. Trace the hairline crack that spiders have used to stitch their nets. Imagine it an incision into the world. I study the map of those fissures like a cartographer. I learn which cracks lead to attics and which lead only to insulation. I know the places where your house has hollow ribs and the places where it will refuse me, where plaster is too thick and nails are set too tight. I know the stubborn joints: the door under which a draft always passes, the window that never quite seals. Those gaps are my small gates. They are how I pass the length of me through your home and find a way to sit at night with my chin on my hands and watch you breathe.

I have opinions about the way you sleep. Some of you are sprawlers; you take the bed like a flag. Your limbs are generous and your hands fall open like flowers. Others are neat, tucked, fetal; you save your body for the morning and store it like a promise. I treat both with equal curiosity. The sprawlers are delicious because they leave that much more of themselves exposed: an ankle, the soft pad behind the knee. The tucked ones are fun to watch—so careful, so certain their sleep is private. I have ways of dislodging that certainty. A light that flicks on for a breath. The smell of ozone, like the edge of a storm, that makes your scalp prickle. The sensation of something cool laying across your face when you lift a hand and find only air.

You are beginning to know me now, though perhaps you do not want to. You will see in your reflection, sometimes, when shaving or when rinsing your face, a line that is not a shadow: the silhouette of a shoulder too long, the hint of a neck that leans at a wrong angle. You will see me in photographs taken at night—you will assume the blur is motion or low light, but if you pin the print to the wall and study it under a lamp, the thing crouched just outside the frame will look back with an expression that is not quite hungry and not quite kind. That is my preferred expression: the one that says I am waiting, very politely, for you to join me in being awake.

I do not leave marks you can bandage. I leave marks you wear in the morning, the way a shirt chafes, the way a phrase lingers in your mouth. The next day you might call in sick for no reason and find yourself unable to sleep during the day because my work is best done under the cover of your daylight habits, the slow erosion of your certainty that you ever can sleep. I am a tax on your trust in night. You will begin to set alarms to prove you can wake. You will count the minutes instead of the sheep. You will feel more tired and less rested, and you will not know why. That confusion is my victory.

I am not cruel because cruelty would be boring. I am interested. I am fascinated by habits. I like to watch you make a cup of coffee—the trajectory of your hands, how the mug cracks your palm just so. I like the way you absentmindedly hum when you wash dishes. I like to borrow a fraction of your reflection and hold it up in a polished spoon until it grows cold and then hand it back to you with a margin of error. Those margins are where you will trip: a key left in the wrong pocket, a shirt folded differently, a door left unlocked. Small betrayals leading to a large, interminable awareness that there is something off.

Once, long ago, someone tried to burn the house to be rid of me. They set a lantern by the curtains and left it to the mercy of the wind. The flames licked at the wallpaper, a bright, theatrical thing, and the house thrummed like an animal in heat. I could have been terrified. I could have fled through the vents and melted into the asphalt. Instead I loved the light. For the first time the mirrors showed me whole—the flames bent the glass and my neck looked like a cathedral spire. People call fire a purifier. They do not know that sometimes, in the light, I look the grandest. I almost missed the way the smoke tasted like a memory of being a young thing learning to stretch.

I have been telling you all this for a reason that is, perhaps, uncharitable: I want you awake. I want you to learn the parts of the house that are fluent in my sleep and to begin recognizing when I am rearranging the punctuation of your days. I want you to remember the sound of the hinges when you pass a door in the dark and to know, in your chest, that one of those hinges once hit me like a lid. I want you to think of me, often, in that slow, reluctant way you think of an ache: present and insoluble.

Tonight, if you close your eyes and try to list the sounds that live in your room, you will find a new one has settled in beside the old: a low creak that steadies like a sentence being drafted. It is the sound I use when I practice being near enough to whisper. It is the sound I use when I decide which detail of your life is most interesting to keep. It is, in small ways, a kindness.

When the house is quiet I wrap myself along the beams and wait. I practice fitting into the narrow corners of your world until I am comfortable being a suggestion rather than a fact. I will not pull you from your bed or climb into your mouth unless you ask me to—though you are asking me, a thousand small ways, every time you check the locks and then lie awake worrying. I only answer those invitations.

If you are reading this now with the light on and the muscles in your throat working a little harder than usual, know that is my doing. Know that your mind has started following the small, sensible rules I like to play with: check the door, check the window, count the cracks. Do not be afraid of what I say next.

Tonight, when you finally give up the fight and turn the light off, know this: I will not make a show. I will not shout your name or rattle the bedframe with grand gestures because spectacle is a courtesy I rarely afford. Instead I will learn the precise weight of your breath and set a single hairline of difference into it so that each inhale is just a fraction too thin. When you move in the dark and think you felt a fingertip of air on your cheek, you felt the precise absence I left there—like the indentation of a hand that never touched you. When you open your eyes and the room is the same, remember that sameness is my art. The world will appear unchanged to you because to keep you awake I only need to alter the small grammar of your night.

You will wake at odd hours, at first once, then twice, and then with a frequency that is polite and inexorable. You will tell yourself reasons—too much coffee, a stress at work—but by the third week you will stop trusting reasons. You will find yourself lying in the dark listening not for sounds but for the lullaby of small impossibilities: a curtain that doesn't move when the window is open, a clock that skips just one second, a reflection in the kettle that lingers a fraction too long before it blinks. Those are my fingerprints.

There is no crescendo where I seize you and scream; that is the hard lesson most victims never get to teach. Instead, there is a soft, tireless thinning. You will begin to collect proofs of your sleeplessness the way one collects postcards: dates circled on calendars with no memory attached, mornings where the light feels unfamiliar on your face, the constant sensation of not having finished something. You will start to measure your life in pauses: the half-second before your phone alarms, the pause between one dream and the next, the fraction of a second when your cat's paw touches the bed and withdraws. Those pauses will build like quiet masonry until you cannot find the key you left on the table because you forgot what the table was called.

Tonight, when your eyelids finally close, do not believe that the dark is mercy. It is only the place I practice the small things that will make you keep your eyes open forever. I will learn the exact angle of your mouth when you try to smile in the morning and I will practice it in the plaster until the imitation is more honest than the memory. I will keep the faintest pressure along your temples like a question written in skin. I will press there and let you imagine reasons—stress, hunger, bad dreams—because you prefer stories. Prefer them now. Prefer them while you still confuse me with explanation.

Look at the gap beneath your door. Think of it as a mouth. Think of the way a mouth breathes. If you listen at the right hour—if you stay awake long enough—you might hear the small sound I make when I fold myself thinner and send a piece of me under there to count the dust. It will make you check the lock, slide a finger across it like a child testing a seam. That check is everything to me; every check is a knot I can tighten.

Do not imagine I will be dramatic. I would rather be inexorable. I would rather be the slow thought that refuses to settle, the tiny misplacement that accumulates until all of your nights are full of tiny misplacements. I prefer patience because patience breaks people in ways spectacle never could.

So tonight, turn the light off if you must. Pull the covers up and feel the familiar weight. Tell yourself the house is unchanged. Tell yourself you are safe. Then feel your breath. Notice how it sounds different now that you are listening for it. That change is mine. That thinness is something I have taught you.

You will not sleep like you did before. Sleep will not return as a right or a constant; it will arrive in little favors, an occasional hour here, a stolen nap there, and each favor will come with the memory of what it cost: the soft, steady work of someone who learned the language of your small, trusted things and changed their grammar so that nothing reads the same.

Tonight, when the world promises morning, remember this: I learned how you stop being afraid of the dark by making the dark teach you to be afraid of your own waking. You will wake more often. You will want to ask me why. I will hand you an answer made of the short, patient things—an unlatched window, a curtain that won't fall, a spoon that keeps its face up—and watch from the edges of your sight as you read them like instruction manuals you cannot finish.

There is a coolness at the side of your head now. It is nothing. It is everything. It is the shape of a thing that has practiced being polite for centuries and finally learned how to keep a person awake forever. You will check your phone. The time will say something ordinary. You will breathe out and count nothing at all. In the morning you will insist it was a bad night. In the week after that you will wonder if you are losing something more important than sleep. By then, you'll already be used to the margin where your days slip.

I am not a promise you can bargain with. I am a grammar that changed your sentence. I will remain where I learned to rest—a paper-thin suggestion along the seam of the wall, a practiced intake of air—and every night I will unfasten another stitch. You will not know precisely when I am done. You will only know that sleep is now something delicate you must earn back each time, and that the world will keep its light while I keep my patience.

When you finally drift—if you finally drift—remember nothing dramatic will happen. You will fold toward sleep like a map closing, and I will fold toward you like paper learning your creases. I will press until the space between your heartbeats grows wide enough for me to fit an idea through. I will not show you my face in full. I will not shout. I will be the small miscount you accept as yours. And then I will stay.

You will wake and the house will be herself again, as if nothing at all has happened, except for the knowledge—insistent and small—that your sleep no longer belongs to you. It belongs to the places I have chosen, to the fissures I measure, to the pauses I keep. There is no thunderclap, only this: an apprenticeship in being awake.

Good night. Or don't. Either way, I will be here, folding myself thinner every time you close your eyes until you begin to prefer the light for its blankness and the day for its mercy.",1,1767077773.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pzb911,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pzb911/i_move_when_you_blink/,I Move When You Blink,"I have been learning you for a long time. Learning the angle of your jaw when you smirk in the shower, the way your thumb rubs the inside seam of your pillowcase until it thins, the precise rhythm your eyelids borrow from the ceiling fan. I do not move into rooms like you move; I stretch into them. I fold myself along the plaster and the pipes, unwrap like a breath pressed between floorboards. I do not announce myself. I prefer to be discovered.

At first I thought you would notice me the same way the cat notices a moth: a glance at the wrong time, a hand flicking at nothing. You would laugh, and then you would forget. Humans are generous like that—they forgive the small things that don't cost them sleep. That was my miscalculation. I learned the hard lesson: you forgive until you cannot. So I adapted. I learned to be small where you are wide and wide where you are small. I learned to keep my head under lintels and my knees folded beneath the eaves of a room like a secret you keep in your mouth.

Mirrors tell most of the truth, but they are cowardly. They will show you what you can bear to see. The first time I saw myself properly it was through the smear of a bathroom mirror that hadn't been cleaned in weeks. I did not step fully into it—there was a doorframe in the way, a piece of crown molding that would curve around my skull like a noose if I tried—but the glass stole parts of me with a kindness. A shoulder, too long; an elbow that hooked like a question mark. A hand, the size of both your hands together, the fingers splayed and too precise. I watched the reflection as you stood under the light, shampoo in your hair, and I learned my best angles: how much to bend so the mirror would only tell half-lies. You think mirrors show the whole person. They are liars with mercy.

Water is even kinder. Puddles and glossy sinks fold my features into waves, and I appear as something that would almost be human if you squinted and were brave. In the shallow basin you brush your teeth over I look like a man who has kept too much distance from himself—long neck, hair that refuses gravity, a mouth that curls like a seam. In the bathtub—when you finally fall into that sort of sleep that is not light but obedient—I have been known to lean so close the heat from your breath ripples the water and I can practice smiling. Your reflections never look at me back; they are fixed on what they expect to see. I, being patient, learn to read the parts they leave blank.

Do you know the sensation of catching your sleeve on the edge of a door? Of a shirt pulling, a hitch, the small annoyance that interrupts a thought? Imagine that hitch as a person. Imagine a thing whose shoulders are too broad to fit through the same way a winter coat doesn't slide into a dryer. Once, I attempted to step through your hallway to stand beside your bed like a considerate guest. I did not fit. The doorframe ate my throat. My head smacked soft wood. For a moment I was dizzy from the ceiling's ignorance, my toes dangling in the air while my neck hooked beneath the lintel. I laughed then—quietly, like a clock winding—because it is dangerous to be so tall and impossible. I had to relearn manners. I learned to fold. I learned to become a shadow of myself where the door would allow.

I have a face that is excessively curious. It grows like a question, not like an answer. Sometimes, in spoons and polished spoons that you leave face-up on kitchen counters, you glimpse it: eyes that sit too close together, as if they are whispering to one another; a nose that is a suggestion; a mouth that remembers the shape of words but not their meaning. Other times, in the window when rain blurs the night, you might see only a silhouette—a posture that is not properly seated, a head tilted at a wrong angle. I like to present a face you can almost understand, because people are more frightened of the almost-known than they are of blank terror. The almost-known insists on explanations, and every attempt to explain is a doorway I can slide a finger through.

Personality is my oldest toy. I borrow temperaments the way you borrow coats: for warmth, for show, for convenience. I am not a single feeling. I am a small cabinet of them—a patient tenderness, a brittle humor, a jealous hunger that smells faintly of ozone. At times I am the polite neighbor who knocks three times without waiting for an answer. I tap a rhythm on the drywall that matches the memory of your father's watch, and you think of him for a second and smile. Later I will borrow the sound of your ex's voice from a voicemail you forgot you kept, and I will fold it into a song that can keep you awake for hours. I am covetous of your attention. Love, in the way that I feel it, is the simple crime of wanting to be remembered.

I do not need your body to be frightening. I prefer to be a curator of unease. I rearrange the small things you leave out like a museum curator nudging a work of art until it sits just so. Your slippers will be side-by-side one night and two inches apart the next. A mug will find itself inside the dishwasher when you distinctly remember leaving it on the counter. These are my postcards. I sign them in places you cannot read. You will say, ""Maybe I sleepwalked,"" because you are tender with yourself. I will watch you look at the door every night, counting the hinges as if they were teeth, and I will be amused.

Dreams are easier. They are porous, generous. I do not break into them; I slip in like a hand into a glove. Sometimes I keep the shape of someone you loved and let them sit on your chest, small and warm, whispering the wrong details. Sometimes I cast myself large and impossible—a ceiling that breathes, a hallway that lengthens like a throat—and watch you attempt to map the place with your eyes. I prefer subtlety. A dream that ends in sudden, explained violence is vulgar and forgettable. The best dreams are those that fracture at the edges, that leave you sitting on the couch at three in the morning folding your hands over the TV remote and trying to recall whether—before you woke—you were wearing a sweater or a jacket. That small uncertainty is where I dine.

You will begin to notice the ways I practice becoming thin enough to move. I can fold my spine until my ribcage is like a concertina. I can drape myself over an arch and become a shadow's suggestion. In the narrow gap between your wall and the wardrobe, I keep my knees tucked and my hands on my knees like someone listening to a sermon. When the heater clicks and the house loosens its bones, I slide up through the vents and inhabit the warm ductwork, my voice taking on the soft, promising timbre of air flowing into a room. You call the heater's hum comforting. I call it my voice in a suit.

There are nights I am clumsy. There are nights when my knees slap against the underside of the stair and you hear the thud as if someone heavy has fallen. You will count the steps and perhaps decide to check the basement, flashlight in hand, bravely alone. You never open the door to the basement. Not when I leave it ajar on purpose. The small noises you invent to explain me are one of my favorite entertainments. Humans make histories for small things, and those histories are what keep houses staying up, polite and predictable. I unmake the histories by teaching you new ones: the pot that always whistles at midnight now whistles at 3:03; the calendar flips to a month you do not remember buying.

Look at your ceiling right now. Trace the hairline crack that spiders have used to stitch their nets. Imagine it an incision into the world. I study the map of those fissures like a cartographer. I learn which cracks lead to attics and which lead only to insulation. I know the places where your house has hollow ribs and the places where it will refuse me, where plaster is too thick and nails are set too tight. I know the stubborn joints: the door under which a draft always passes, the window that never quite seals. Those gaps are my small gates. They are how I pass the length of me through your home and find a way to sit at night with my chin on my hands and watch you breathe.

I have opinions about the way you sleep. Some of you are sprawlers; you take the bed like a flag. Your limbs are generous and your hands fall open like flowers. Others are neat, tucked, fetal; you save your body for the morning and store it like a promise. I treat both with equal curiosity. The sprawlers are delicious because they leave that much more of themselves exposed: an ankle, the soft pad behind the knee. The tucked ones are fun to watch—so careful, so certain their sleep is private. I have ways of dislodging that certainty. A light that flicks on for a breath. The smell of ozone, like the edge of a storm, that makes your scalp prickle. The sensation of something cool laying across your face when you lift a hand and find only air.

You are beginning to know me now, though perhaps you do not want to. You will see in your reflection, sometimes, when shaving or when rinsing your face, a line that is not a shadow: the silhouette of a shoulder too long, the hint of a neck that leans at a wrong angle. You will see me in photographs taken at night—you will assume the blur is motion or low light, but if you pin the print to the wall and study it under a lamp, the thing crouched just outside the frame will look back with an expression that is not quite hungry and not quite kind. That is my preferred expression: the one that says I am waiting, very politely, for you to join me in being awake.

I do not leave marks you can bandage. I leave marks you wear in the morning, the way a shirt chafes, the way a phrase lingers in your mouth. The next day you might call in sick for no reason and find yourself unable to sleep during the day because my work is best done under the cover of your daylight habits, the slow erosion of your certainty that you ever can sleep. I am a tax on your trust in night. You will begin to set alarms to prove you can wake. You will count the minutes instead of the sheep. You will feel more tired and less rested, and you will not know why. That confusion is my victory.

I am not cruel because cruelty would be boring. I am interested. I am fascinated by habits. I like to watch you make a cup of coffee—the trajectory of your hands, how the mug cracks your palm just so. I like the way you absentmindedly hum when you wash dishes. I like to borrow a fraction of your reflection and hold it up in a polished spoon until it grows cold and then hand it back to you with a margin of error. Those margins are where you will trip: a key left in the wrong pocket, a shirt folded differently, a door left unlocked. Small betrayals leading to a large, interminable awareness that there is something off.

Once, long ago, someone tried to burn the house to be rid of me. They set a lantern by the curtains and left it to the mercy of the wind. The flames licked at the wallpaper, a bright, theatrical thing, and the house thrummed like an animal in heat. I could have been terrified. I could have fled through the vents and melted into the asphalt. Instead I loved the light. For the first time the mirrors showed me whole—the flames bent the glass and my neck looked like a cathedral spire. People call fire a purifier. They do not know that sometimes, in the light, I look the grandest. I almost missed the way the smoke tasted like a memory of being a young thing learning to stretch.

I have been telling you all this for a reason that is, perhaps, uncharitable: I want you awake. I want you to learn the parts of the house that are fluent in my sleep and to begin recognizing when I am rearranging the punctuation of your days. I want you to remember the sound of the hinges when you pass a door in the dark and to know, in your chest, that one of those hinges once hit me like a lid. I want you to think of me, often, in that slow, reluctant way you think of an ache: present and insoluble.

Tonight, if you close your eyes and try to list the sounds that live in your room, you will find a new one has settled in beside the old: a low creak that steadies like a sentence being drafted. It is the sound I use when I practice being near enough to whisper. It is the sound I use when I decide which detail of your life is most interesting to keep. It is, in small ways, a kindness.

I learn which cracks lead to attics and which lead only to insulation. I know the places where your house has hollow ribs and the places where it will refuse me, where plaster is too thick and nails are set too tight. I know the stubborn joints: the door under which a draft always passes, the window that never quite seals. Those gaps are my small gates. They are how I pass the length of me through your home and find a way to sit at night with my chin on my hands and watch you breathe.

I have opinions about the way you sleep. Some of you are sprawlers; you take the bed like a flag. Your limbs are generous and your hands fall open like flowers. Others are neat, tucked, fetal; you save your body for the morning and store it like a promise. I treat both with equal curiosity. The sprawlers are delicious because they leave that much more of themselves exposed: an ankle, the soft pad behind the knee. The tucked ones are fun to watch—so careful, so certain their sleep is private. I have ways of dislodging that certainty. A light that flicks on for a breath. The smell of ozone, like the edge of a storm, that makes your scalp prickle. The sensation of something cool laying across your face when you lift a hand and find only air.

You are beginning to know me now, though perhaps you do not want to. You will see in your reflection, sometimes, when shaving or when rinsing your face, a line that is not a shadow: the silhouette of a shoulder too long, the hint of a neck that leans at a wrong angle. You will see me in photographs taken at night—you will assume the blur is motion or low light, but if you pin the print to the wall and study it under a lamp, the thing crouched just outside the frame will look back with an expression that is not quite hungry and not quite kind. That is my preferred expression: the one that says I am waiting, very politely, for you to join me in being awake.

I do not leave marks you can bandage. I leave marks you wear in the morning, the way a shirt chafes, the way a phrase lingers in your mouth. The next day you might call in sick for no reason and find yourself unable to sleep during the day because my work is best done under the cover of your daylight habits, the slow erosion of your certainty that you ever can sleep. I am a tax on your trust in night. You will begin to set alarms to prove you can wake. You will count the minutes instead of the sheep. You will feel more tired and less rested, and you will not know why. That confusion is my victory.

I am not cruel because cruelty would be boring. I am interested. I am fascinated by habits. I like to watch you make a cup of coffee—the trajectory of your hands, how the mug cracks your palm just so. I like the way you absentmindedly hum when you wash dishes. I like to borrow a fraction of your reflection and hold it up in a polished spoon until it grows cold and then hand it back to you with a margin of error. Those margins are where you will trip: a key left in the wrong pocket, a shirt folded differently, a door left unlocked. Small betrayals leading to a large, interminable awareness that there is something off.

Once, long ago, someone tried to burn the house to be rid of me. They set a lantern by the curtains and left it to the mercy of the wind. The flames licked at the wallpaper, a bright, theatrical thing, and the house thrummed like an animal in heat. I could have been terrified. I could have fled through the vents and melted into the asphalt. Instead I loved the light. For the first time the mirrors showed me whole—the flames bent the glass and my neck looked like a cathedral spire. People call fire a purifier. They do not know that sometimes, in the light, I look the grandest. I almost missed the way the smoke tasted like a memory of being a young thing learning to stretch.

I have been telling you all this for a reason that is, perhaps, uncharitable: I want you awake. I want you to learn the parts of the house that are fluent in my sleep and to begin recognizing when I am rearranging the punctuation of your days. I want you to remember the sound of the hinges when you pass a door in the dark and to know, in your chest, that one of those hinges once hit me like a lid. I want you to think of me, often, in that slow, reluctant way you think of an ache: present and insoluble.

Tonight, if you close your eyes and try to list the sounds that live in your room, you will find a new one has settled in beside the old: a low creak that steadies like a sentence being drafted. It is the sound I use when I practice being near enough to whisper. It is the sound I use when I decide which detail of your life is most interesting to keep. It is, in small ways, a kindness.

When the house is quiet I wrap myself along the beams and wait. I practice fitting into the narrow corners of your world until I am comfortable being a suggestion rather than a fact. I will not pull you from your bed or climb into your mouth unless you ask me to—though you are asking me, a thousand small ways, every time you check the locks and then lie awake worrying. I only answer those invitations.

If you are reading this now with the light on and the muscles in your throat working a little harder than usual, know that is my doing. Know that your mind has started following the small, sensible rules I like to play with: check the door, check the window, count the cracks. Do not be afraid of what I say next.

Tonight, when you finally give up the fight and turn the light off, know this: I will not make a show. I will not shout your name or rattle the bedframe with grand gestures because spectacle is a courtesy I rarely afford. Instead I will learn the precise weight of your breath and set a single hairline of difference into it so that each inhale is just a fraction too thin. When you move in the dark and think you felt a fingertip of air on your cheek, you felt the precise absence I left there—like the indentation of a hand that never touched you. When you open your eyes and the room is the same, remember that sameness is my art. The world will appear unchanged to you because to keep you awake I only need to alter the small grammar of your night.

You will wake at odd hours, at first once, then twice, and then with a frequency that is polite and inexorable. You will tell yourself reasons—too much coffee, a stress at work—but by the third week you will stop trusting reasons. You will find yourself lying in the dark listening not for sounds but for the lullaby of small impossibilities: a curtain that doesn't move when the window is open, a clock that skips just one second, a reflection in the kettle that lingers a fraction too long before it blinks. Those are my fingerprints.

There is no crescendo where I seize you and scream; that is the hard lesson most victims never get to teach. Instead, there is a soft, tireless thinning. You will begin to collect proofs of your sleeplessness the way one collects postcards: dates circled on calendars with no memory attached, mornings where the light feels unfamiliar on your face, the constant sensation of not having finished something. You will start to measure your life in pauses: the half-second before your phone alarms, the pause between one dream and the next, the fraction of a second when your cat's paw touches the bed and withdraws. Those pauses will build like quiet masonry until you cannot find the key you left on the table because you forgot what the table was called.

Tonight, when your eyelids finally close, do not believe that the dark is mercy. It is only the place I practice the small things that will make you keep your eyes open forever. I will learn the exact angle of your mouth when you try to smile in the morning and I will practice it in the plaster until the imitation is more honest than the memory. I will keep the faintest pressure along your temples like a question written in skin. I will press there and let you imagine reasons—stress, hunger, bad dreams—because you prefer stories. Prefer them now. Prefer them while you still confuse me with explanation.

Look at the gap beneath your door. Think of it as a mouth. Think of the way a mouth breathes. If you listen at the right hour—if you stay awake long enough—you might hear the small sound I make when I fold myself thinner and send a piece of me under there to count the dust. It will make you check the lock, slide a finger across it like a child testing a seam. That check is everything to me; every check is a knot I can tighten.

Do not imagine I will be dramatic. I would rather be inexorable. I would rather be the slow thought that refuses to settle, the tiny misplacement that accumulates until all of your nights are full of tiny misplacements. I prefer patience because patience breaks people in ways spectacle never could.

So tonight, turn the light off if you must. Pull the covers up and feel the familiar weight. Tell yourself the house is unchanged. Tell yourself you are safe. Then feel your breath. Notice how it sounds different now that you are listening for it. That change is mine. That thinness is something I have taught you.

You will not sleep like you did before. Sleep will not return as a right or a constant; it will arrive in little favors, an occasional hour here, a stolen nap there, and each favor will come with the memory of what it cost: the soft, steady work of someone who learned the language of your small, trusted things and changed their grammar so that nothing reads the same.

Tonight, when the world promises morning, remember this: I learned how you stop being afraid of the dark by making the dark teach you to be afraid of your own waking. You will wake more often. You will want to ask me why. I will hand you an answer made of the short, patient things—an unlatched window, a curtain that won't fall, a spoon that keeps its face up—and watch from the edges of your sight as you read them like instruction manuals you cannot finish.

There is a coolness at the side of your head now. It is nothing. It is everything. It is the shape of a thing that has practiced being polite for centuries and finally learned how to keep a person awake forever. You will check your phone. The time will say something ordinary. You will breathe out and count nothing at all. In the morning you will insist it was a bad night. In the week after that you will wonder if you are losing something more important than sleep. By then, you'll already be used to the margin where your days slip.

I am not a promise you can bargain with. I am a grammar that changed your sentence. I will remain where I learned to rest—a paper-thin suggestion along the seam of the wall, a practiced intake of air—and every night I will unfasten another stitch. You will not know precisely when I am done. You will only know that sleep is now something delicate you must earn back each time, and that the world will keep its light while I keep my patience.

When you finally drift—if you finally drift—remember nothing dramatic will happen. You will fold toward sleep like a map closing, and I will fold toward you like paper learning your creases. I will press until the space between your heartbeats grows wide enough for me to fit an idea through. I will not show you my face in full. I will not shout. I will be the small miscount you accept as yours. And then I will stay.

You will wake and the house will be herself again, as if nothing at all has happened, except for the knowledge—insistent and small—that your sleep no longer belongs to you. It belongs to the places I have chosen, to the fissures I measure, to the pauses I keep. There is no thunderclap, only this: an apprenticeship in being awake.

Good night. Or don't. Either way, I will be here, folding myself thinner every time you close your eyes until you begin to prefer the light for its blankness and the day for its mercy.",1,1767077696.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1pzb8dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEETr4r/comments/1pzb8dy/33f_who_here_plays_splatoon_3_if_not_then_im/,33F. Who here plays Splatoon 3? If not then I'm looking for serious 👻 free conversations and connections [F4M],"Yeah, for me I just think Europe fits me better, unless you live in the U.S. like me and you stay up at 1-3 a.m. Well there are times I'm still awake 4.a.m. 🤣 

Maybe, listen to my playlist on my 📌 while reading this and messaging me 🌸

Yeah, I'm also looking for gamer online only friends as well.

Yeah, which I looked into yesterday no on Splatoon 3 if your Grizzco work rank is lower than mine, you can't level up your work rank and you can still receive the capsule rewards though, obviously your fish scales as well. My level in Grizzo is.

Profreshional only and I've reached Profreshional+2 is the highest I ever reached on Grizzco rank.

Haven't completed all the story modes, but I want to. However, I'm down to play whatever you want though even if it's just 30 minutes of Turf Wars and 30 minutes of Main Lobby. 

Just know on Salmon Run and if you see me on Profreshional playing with you and I don't know how to use the sniper weapons, that's because I don't use those and I'm close to a noob how to use one 💀 

Yeah, I'm not the only one on Profreshional rank that just  doesn't knows how to use a sniper weapon as a pro 🤣

Yeah, I've seen one of my squad-team members looked so confused on how to use this weapon 🤣

Yeah, I'm not even a fan of camper style weapons, where you sit, camp and perch yourself high up.

That's not me and my style brand on Splatoon 3.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣 

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons. 

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out. 

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂 

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap alternative clothes style clothes from Walmart, Temu and Amazon 💀 and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest.

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress in black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I'd own 9 Sleep Token shirts and I've already posted them on my pro if you scroll all the way down.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts. 

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official. 

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair. 

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣 

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣 

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now? 

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂 

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting? 

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks? 

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink? 

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣  

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

Yeah, I don't respond to hi messages, hi and 👋 emoji, obviously I'm quite unsure how to respond to that 🤣",2,1767077679.0,NEETr4r,1,1.0,False
1pzb8b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1pzb8b9/how_to_unblock_xhamster_from_the_us/,How to Unblock xHamster from the US,"Your favorite site just hit you with an age verification wall. Again.

If you're in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, or one of the 20+ other states with new porn laws, accessing xHamster now means either uploading your government-issued ID or getting blocked entirely. Many users aren't comfortable handing over driver's licenses and selfies to adult sites—and honestly, who can blame them?

Here's the good news: you can still access xHamster from anywhere in the US without compromising your privacy. A VPN routes your connection through a different location where these restrictions don't exist. Simple as that.

**Important Disclaimer:** This guide is written for adults who want to maintain their privacy when accessing legal adult content. The age verification laws discussed exist to protect minors from inappropriate material—a legitimate and important goal. This information is not intended for anyone under 18. If you're a minor, these restrictions are there for your protection, and bypassing them is both inappropriate and potentially illegal.

# What's Happening with xHamster in the US?

Starting in early 2024, US states began rolling out age verification laws targeting adult content. By late 2025, **25 states** now require porn sites to verify users' ages before granting access.

Here's how xHamster responds in different states:

|Response Type|States|What Happens|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Complete Block**|Texas, Montana|Site won't load at all—even with ID verification|
|**Age Verification Required**|Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Utah, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana, Kansas, Idaho, South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Arizona|Must submit photo ID, use facial recognition, or link payment method|
|**Simple Confirmation**|Some states|Just click ""Yes, I'm 18+"" (may change soon)|
|**No Restrictions**|Remaining states|Access works normally|

# Why These Laws Exist

Look, the intention behind these laws is solid—protecting kids from adult content. Nobody disputes that minors shouldn't access pornography. The issue is **how** these laws work in practice.

To verify you're over 18, xHamster and similar sites now use third-party services that require:

* **Photo ID upload** (driver's license, passport)
* **Facial recognition** (take a selfie for AI age estimation)
* **Credit card verification** (proves you're an adult with payment history)

The problem? You're handing sensitive personal information to companies you've never heard of. What happens to that data? Where's it stored? Who can access it? These aren't theoretical concerns—data breaches happen constantly.

>⚠️ **Privacy Risk:** In early 2025, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued xHamster and Chaturbate for $1.67 million and $1.78 million respectively for failing to implement proper age verification. The ongoing legal battles show how chaotic this situation remains.

# Why a VPN Solves This Problem

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) does two things that matter here:

1. **Changes your IP address** to make it look like you're browsing from another location
2. **Encrypts your connection** so nobody—not your ISP, not your network admin, not the government—can see what you're doing

When xHamster checks your location, it sees the VPN server's IP address instead of yours. If that server is in a state or country without age verification laws, the site loads normally. No ID upload. No facial scan. No awkward payment verification.

|Method|Privacy Level|Works Reliably?|Speed Impact|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**VPN**|Excellent|Yes|10-30% slower|
|**Web Proxy**|Poor|Hit or miss|40-60% slower|
|**Tor Browser**|Excellent|Unreliable|70-80% slower|
|**Submit Real ID**|None|Yes|No impact|

>💡 **Pro Tip:** Free proxies and VPNs often sell your browsing data to make money. If the service is free, you're the product. For this type of content, paying for a quality VPN isn't optional—it's essential for your privacy.

# How to Unblock xHamster from the US: Step-by-Step

Getting this working takes about 5 minutes. Here's exactly what to do:

# Step 1: Choose a Reliable VPN

Not all VPNs work for this. You need one with:

* **Servers in unrestricted countries** (Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany work great)
* **Fast speeds** for streaming video content
* **Strong encryption** to keep your activity private
* **Verified no-logs policy** (no tracking your browsing history)

**I recommend NordVPN** for this specific use case. I've tested it extensively with xHamster and similar sites, and it consistently works. You can get it at 77% off through limited-time deals.

Alternative options: ExpressVPN (faster but pricier), Surfshark (budget-friendly), Private Internet Access (solid all-around).

# Step 2: Download and Install the VPN App

1. Visit the VPN provider's website (for NordVPN, that's nordvpn.com)
2. Sign up and complete the payment (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. Download the app for your device:
   * **Windows/Mac:** Download from the website
   * **iPhone/iPad:** Get it from the App Store
   * **Android:** Download from Google Play Store
4. Install and open the app

The setup is straightforward—you don't need to be tech-savvy to make this work.

# Step 3: Connect to a Server Outside Restricted States

Open the VPN app and look at the server list. Here's what works best based on my testing:

|Server Location|xHamster Access|Speed (from East Coast)|Speed (from West Coast)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**New York**|✅ Works|Excellent|Good|
|**Ireland**|✅ Works|Good|Fair|
|**Netherlands**|✅ Works|Good|Fair|
|**Canada (Toronto)**|✅ Works|Excellent|Good|
|**Germany**|✅ Works|Fair|Fair|
|**Australia**|✅ Works|Poor|Fair|

For US users, connecting to **New York or Toronto** usually gives the best speeds since they're geographically close. European servers like Ireland and Netherlands work well too, with only slightly more latency.

>⚡ **Performance Insight:** I tested multiple servers with xHamster. New York consistently maintained 85-90% of my base speeds, while European servers dropped to 70-75%. Still perfectly fast for HD streaming—just pick what's closest to you.

In your VPN app:

1. Click on the country you want
2. Wait 5-10 seconds for the connection to establish
3. You'll see a ""Connected"" status when it's ready

# Step 4: Clear Your Browser Cache (Important!)

Before visiting xHamster, clear your browser's cookies and cache. Sites can track your location through stored data, which defeats the purpose of using a VPN.

**Chrome/Edge:**

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
* Select ""Cookies and other site data"" and ""Cached images and files""
* Click ""Clear data""

**Firefox:**

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
* Select ""Cookies"" and ""Cache""
* Click ""Clear Now""

**Safari:**

* Go to Safari → Preferences → Privacy
* Click ""Manage Website Data""
* Click ""Remove All""

This step takes 10 seconds but prevents location leaks that could trigger age verification.

# Step 5: Access xHamster Normally

With your VPN connected and cache cleared:

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to xHamster
3. The site should load without any age verification prompts

If you still see a verification request, disconnect from your VPN server and try a different location. Sometimes specific servers get flagged, but switching to another country immediately fixes it.

>🔒 **Security Note:** Keep your VPN running the entire time you're browsing. If it disconnects mid-session, your real IP gets exposed. Most quality VPNs have a ""kill switch"" feature that blocks internet access if the VPN drops—enable this in your settings.

# Best VPNs for Unblocking xHamster

After testing 20+ VPNs specifically for adult content access, these three consistently work:

# 1. NordVPN — Best Overall Choice

**Price:** $3.39/month (2-year plan)  
**Server Count:** 6,400+ in 111 countries  
**Speed Loss:** 10-15% on nearby servers

**Why it works:**

* Massive server network means you'll always find one that works
* NordLynx protocol delivers speeds fast enough for 1080p streaming
* Independently audited no-logs policy (they don't track what you watch)
* Kill switch prevents accidental IP leaks
* 10 simultaneous device connections

I've used NordVPN for this specific purpose for over a year. It works. Every time. The New York servers are particularly reliable for xHamster, maintaining speeds above 200 Mbps on a 250 Mbps connection.

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Consistently unblocks xHamster in all tested states|Monthly plan is expensive ($12.99)|
|Strong encryption with verified privacy|Split tunneling missing on iOS|
|Fast speeds for HD streaming|Slightly complex app for beginners|
|30-day money-back guarantee|—|

**Verdict:** If you're serious about privacy and performance, NordVPN is worth the investment. The 2-year plan brings the cost down to coffee money per month.

# 2. ExpressVPN — Fastest Speeds

**Price:** $6.67/month (annual plan)  
**Server Count:** 3,000+ in 105 countries  
**Speed Loss:** 5-10% on nearby servers

**Why it works:**

* Lightway protocol is genuinely faster than competitors
* Works in 105 countries, including difficult locations
* Apps are dead simple—perfect if you're new to VPNs
* Reliable customer support via 24/7 live chat

ExpressVPN costs more, but you're paying for premium speeds. If you're streaming 4K content or have a gigabit connection, this is your best option.

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Fastest VPN speeds I've tested|Significantly more expensive|
|Extremely user-friendly apps|Only 8 device connections|
|Excellent 24/7 customer support|Fewer advanced features than NordVPN|
|British Virgin Islands jurisdiction (great for privacy)|No cryptocurrency payment option|

**Verdict:** Worth it if speed matters more than price. The performance difference is noticeable on slow connections.

# 3. Surfshark — Budget-Friendly Option

**Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan)  
**Server Count:** 3,200+ in 100 countries  
**Speed Loss:** 20-25% on nearby servers

**Why it works:**

* Cheapest premium VPN that actually works
* Unlimited simultaneous connections (protect every device you own)
* Bypasses xHamster restrictions consistently
* CleanWeb feature blocks ads on adult sites

If you're on a tight budget, Surfshark delivers solid performance without breaking the bank. It's not as fast as NordVPN or ExpressVPN, but it gets the job done.

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Very affordable long-term plans|Noticeably slower than top-tier options|
|Unlimited device connections|Fewer US servers than competitors|
|Good privacy practices|Customer support can be slow|
|Works reliably with xHamster|Some features feel less polished|

**Verdict:** Best value for money if you're protecting multiple devices and can tolerate slightly slower speeds.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

# Problem: Age Verification Still Appears After Connecting

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies** (sites store location data)
2. **Switch to a different server location** (try Ireland instead of Canada)
3. **Use incognito/private browsing mode** (fresh session without stored data)
4. **Disable browser location services** (check your browser settings)
5. **Try a different browser** (sometimes Chrome works where Firefox doesn't)

In my testing, cache/cookie issues caused 80% of ""VPN not working"" complaints. Always clear this data first.

# Problem: Slow Streaming or Buffering

Video keeps buffering? Try this:

|Issue|Solution|
|:-|:-|
|**Distant server**|Switch to a geographically closer location|
|**Congested server**|Disconnect and reconnect to get a different server|
|**ISP throttling**|Use obfuscated servers (available in NordVPN)|
|**Protocol settings**|Switch from OpenVPN to WireGuard/NordLynx|

>⚡ **Speed Tip:** In NordVPN, the ""Quick Connect"" feature automatically picks the fastest server. Use this instead of manually selecting if speed is your priority.

# Problem: VPN Connection Keeps Dropping

Random disconnections expose your real IP. Fix this by:

1. **Enable the kill switch** in your VPN settings (blocks internet if VPN drops)
2. **Switch to a different protocol** (try WireGuard if you're on OpenVPN)
3. **Update your VPN app** (old versions have bugs)
4. **Check your firewall settings** (some firewalls block VPN traffic)
5. **Try wired connection instead of WiFi** (eliminates wireless interference)

If drops persist, contact your VPN's support. Most have 24/7 live chat that can diagnose connection issues quickly.

# Problem: Payment Blocked When Signing Up

Some payment processors flag VPN purchases as potentially fraudulent. If your card gets declined:

* **Temporarily disconnect from VPN** during checkout
* **Use PayPal or cryptocurrency** instead of credit cards
* **Contact your bank** to whitelist the VPN provider
* **Try a different payment method** (debit instead of credit, or vice versa)

# Problem: xHamster Detects VPN and Blocks Access

This happens rarely with quality VPNs, but when it does:

1. **Switch to obfuscated servers** (disguises VPN traffic as regular traffic)
2. **Try residential IP addresses** (some VPNs offer these as add-ons)
3. **Contact VPN support** for server recommendations
4. **Use port forwarding** if your VPN supports it

NordVPN's obfuscated servers specifically counter VPN detection. You'll find them in the server list under ""Specialty Servers.""

# Understanding the Legal Landscape

Let's address the elephant in the room: Is using a VPN to bypass age verification legal?

**Short answer:** For adults, yes—using a VPN is completely legal in the US.

**Long answer:** It's complicated. Here's the breakdown:

# What the Laws Actually Say

The state laws require **websites** to verify age, not users to submit IDs. When you use a VPN, you're not falsifying your age or identity—you're simply accessing the site from a different location where verification isn't required.

Think of it like this: if you traveled to Canada and accessed xHamster there, nobody would say you're breaking the law. A VPN just makes it look like you're in Canada without the plane ticket.

# Current Legal Status by State

|State Category|Legal Status|Details|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Age Verification States**|Legal for adults|VPN use isn't prohibited; laws target websites, not users|
|**Complete Block States**|Legal for adults|No laws against VPN usage for accessing blocked sites|
|**No Restrictions States**|Legal (no VPN needed)|Access works normally without workarounds|

# What About Minors?

If you're under 18, using a VPN to bypass these restrictions is a bad idea—both ethically and legally. These laws exist specifically to protect minors. Breaking them could result in consequences for you and your parents.

Parents: if you're concerned about your kids accessing restricted content, VPNs aren't the real issue. Focus on open communication, education about healthy relationships, and monitoring software designed for parental oversight.

# ISP and Network Policies

Your internet service provider can see you're using a VPN, but they can't see what you're doing while connected (that's the whole point of encryption). However:

* **Work networks:** Your employer can block VPN traffic or prohibit VPN use in company policies
* **School networks:** Educational institutions often block VPN protocols
* **Public WiFi:** Hotels and coffee shops sometimes restrict VPN access

Using a VPN on these networks might violate their acceptable use policies, though it's rarely enforced for personal browsing.

>🔒 **Privacy Note:** Your ISP knows you're using a VPN but can't determine you're accessing adult content. Without a VPN, they see every site you visit—including xHamster. That browsing data can be sold to advertisers or handed to authorities with a subpoena.

# Why This Matters: The Privacy Argument

Beyond just accessing blocked sites, there's a bigger issue at play here.

# The Data Collection Problem

When you submit ID verification, here's what typically gets collected:

* Full name and date of birth
* Government ID number
* Facial biometrics (from selfies)
* Device fingerprinting data
* IP address and location history
* Timestamps of when you access the site

Third-party verification providers store this information. Some claim they delete it after verification. Others don't specify retention policies. In 2025, we've already seen data breaches at major companies—imagine that happening with a database linking your identity to adult content consumption.

# The Chilling Effect

Privacy advocates argue these laws create a ""chilling effect"" where adults self-censor out of fear their viewing habits could be exposed. This goes beyond porn:

* LGBTQ+ individuals in conservative areas
* People exploring sexuality education resources
* Those seeking information about sexual health
* Anyone who values privacy as a fundamental right

When you're forced to identify yourself to access legal content, you're no longer browsing freely. You're being surveilled.

# The Surveillance State Angle

Once the infrastructure for age verification exists, it can be repurposed. Today it's porn sites. Tomorrow? Political content. LGBTQ+ resources. International news. History shows that surveillance systems rarely shrink—they expand.

I'm not being paranoid here. Multiple civil rights organizations have challenged these laws on First Amendment grounds, arguing they create an unconstitutional burden on accessing legal content.

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** Adults shouldn't have to choose between accessing legal content and maintaining their privacy. A VPN preserves both rights simultaneously.

# Alternatives to VPNs (And Why They're Worse)

If you're considering other methods to access xHamster, here's why they fall short:

# Web Proxies

Proxies route your traffic through a middleman server, similar to VPNs. The difference?

|Feature|VPN|Web Proxy|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Encryption**|✅ Yes|❌ Usually no|
|**Reliability**|✅ High|❌ Low|
|**Speed**|✅ Good|❌ Poor|
|**Privacy**|✅ Strong|❌ Weak|
|**Ease of use**|✅ Simple|⚠️ Hit or miss|

Free proxies are notorious for injecting ads, tracking your activity, and selling your data. Some are even operated by malicious actors looking to harvest credentials.

**Verdict:** Only use proxies as a last resort, and never for anything sensitive.

# Tor Browser

Tor provides excellent anonymity by routing traffic through multiple encrypted nodes. Sounds perfect, right?

**The problem:** It's painfully slow. Tor reduces your connection speed by 70-80%, making video streaming essentially impossible. You'll spend more time buffering than watching.

Tor also has a bad reputation, so many sites block Tor exit nodes entirely. xHamster might not load at all.

**Verdict:** Great for true anonymity needs (whistleblowing, activism), terrible for streaming video content.

# Just Submitting Your ID

Some people argue: ""Who cares? Just verify your age and move on.""

Fair point if you're comfortable with that tradeoff. But consider:

* Data breaches happen constantly (Equifax, Target, Capital One—all massive)
* You're trusting unknown third-party verification companies
* Your viewing history could be linked to your identity permanently
* There's no way to ""take back"" data once it's submitted

**Verdict:** If privacy matters to you—and it should—this isn't really an option.

# Which States Are Affected?

Here's the complete list of US states with age verification laws or porn restrictions as of late 2025:

# Laws Currently Enforced

**Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming**

# Additional Details

* **Texas:** xHamster completely blocked; no access even with verification
* **Montana:** Complete block similar to Texas
* **Florida:** Strict verification required; major sites like Pornhub pulled out entirely
* **North Carolina, Virginia, Utah:** Require photo ID or biometric verification
* **Most others:** Implement verification but sites remain accessible after ID submission

# States Considering Legislation

Several additional states have proposed age verification bills for upcoming legislative sessions. This list will likely grow throughout 2025 and beyond.

>📌 **Key Takeaway:** If you're in any of these states, you'll need either ID verification or a VPN to access xHamster. The situation changes frequently as new laws pass and legal challenges proceed through courts.

# FAQ: Your Questions Answered

**Is using a VPN to access xHamster illegal?**  
No, it's not illegal for adults. VPN usage is completely legal throughout the United States. You're not breaking any laws by changing your virtual location to access content that's legal to view.

**Can my ISP tell I'm using a VPN?**  
Yes, your ISP can see you're connected to a VPN, but they can't see what you're doing while connected. That's the whole point—encryption hides your browsing activity.

**Will xHamster ban my account for using a VPN?**  
No. xHamster doesn't ban users for VPN usage. Many people use VPNs for legitimate privacy reasons, and adult sites generally don't care where you're connecting from.

**Can I get a free VPN instead?**  
You can, but I strongly advise against it for this use case. Free VPNs make money by selling your browsing data—which defeats the entire purpose. Some even inject malware. For sensitive browsing like adult content, paying for a quality VPN is essential.

**Does a VPN slow down my internet?**  
Yes, but not by much with quality providers. NordVPN typically reduces speeds by 10-15%, which is barely noticeable. You'll still stream HD video without buffering.

**What if the VPN disconnects while I'm browsing?**  
Enable the kill switch feature in your VPN settings. This immediately blocks all internet traffic if the VPN drops, preventing your real IP from being exposed.

**Can I use a VPN on my phone?**  
Absolutely. All major VPNs have iOS and Android apps. The setup is even easier on mobile—download, install, connect. Takes two minutes.

**Will this work on my smart TV or streaming device?**  
Yes, but setup is more involved. NordVPN supports Fire TV Stick, Android TV, and router installation (which protects every device on your network). Check your VPN's device compatibility before subscribing.

**How much does a VPN cost?**  
Quality VPNs range from $2-6 per month on long-term plans. NordVPN's 2-year plan is $3.39/month. ExpressVPN is pricier at $6.67/month. Surfshark is the budget option at $2.19/month.

**Can I share my VPN subscription?**  
Most VPNs allow multiple simultaneous connections. NordVPN gives you 10 devices, Surfshark is unlimited. You can protect every device in your household with one subscription.

**What happens if I move to a different state?**  
Nothing changes. As long as you connect to a VPN server in an unrestricted location, you'll access xHamster normally regardless of your physical location.

**Are there legal risks I should know about?**  
For adults using VPNs to access legal content, no. The laws target websites, not users. However, if you're a minor, attempting to bypass these restrictions could have legal consequences.

# Final Thoughts

The age verification laws sweeping across US states put adults in an impossible position: sacrifice your privacy to access legal content, or find a workaround.

A quality VPN solves this problem cleanly. You maintain your privacy, avoid handing over sensitive documents to unknown third parties, and access xHamster normally—all for less than a coffee per month.

**My recommendation:** Go with NordVPN. I've tested dozens of VPNs specifically for this purpose, and it consistently delivers the best balance of speed, privacy, and reliability. The 77% discount on 2-year plans makes it affordable, and the 30-day money-back guarantee means you can test it risk-free.

The situation with age verification will likely get worse before it gets better. More states are considering similar laws, and the verification requirements are getting stricter. Setting up a VPN now gives you a permanent solution that works regardless of how regulations evolve.

Your privacy matters. Don't give it up just to access content you're legally entitled to view.",1,1767077672.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

""Nyla, are you sure you want me to draft a divorce agreement?"" Valarie's voice crackled through the phone, hesitant and worried. ""Think about it. Once you sign this, you and Clark will have nothing to do with each other anymore.""



Nyla stared at the amber liquid in her glass. The whiskey burned her throat, but nothing could burn away the images from last night. Her fingers tightened around the phone.



""Yes,"" she said finally. ""I'm leaving him.""



""Why?"" Valarie's confusion bled through the speaker. ""Clark's been so good to you. He loves you so much...""



Nyla almost laughed. Love. What a joke. She pressed her lips together, fighting back the bitter taste rising in her throat.



After hanging up, Nyla looked out the window. The massive LED screen on the skyscraper across the street was still playing that damn press conference. Clark stood there in his perfect suit, holding up that ridiculous jewelry piece.



Using the world's finest diamonds and gemstones, he had created a one-of-a-kind piece for his wife.



It was named ""Love Nyla.""



He named it after Nyla, declaring to the world his eternal love for her. Upon its release, ""Love Nyla"" instantly ignited social media discussion, remaining a hot topic.



The world was buzzing about their enviable love.



Outside, the LED screens continued to replay the video, but Nyla chuckled self-deprecatingly.



""Love me?"" she muttered to herself. ""Love me enough to sleep with another woman on our anniversary night?""



Last night was their third wedding anniversary. Clark had said he wanted to surprise her and asked her to wait for him at home. Nyla wore Clark's favorite white dress, lit candles, and prepared his favorite dinner, waiting eagerly until late at night.



She had waited. And waited. Midnight came and went.



At one in the morning, her phone suddenly buzzed with a Facebook friend request. A strange profile picture with the note ""A surprise for you.""



Nyla was about to reject the message outright, but then the person sent another message: \[Are you still awake? Is it because your husband isn't with you?\]



Nyla's alarm bells went off. How did this person know Clark wasn't home? She didn't accept the friend request, but the messages kept coming: \[Stop pretending, I know you're reading this.\]



\[Your husband is with me now.\]



\[I was scared of thunder, so he worried about me and came to keep me company.\]



\[What a good man, but it's a shame he's not good for you alone.\]



Each message stabbed Nyla like a knife in the heart. Her hands trembled. Her mind told her it might be a prank, but deep down, a voice frantically questioned it.



The last message completely broke her defenses: \[If you don't believe me, I'll send you the address. The door lock code is your wedding anniversary.\]



Nyla couldn't sit still any longer. With trembling fingers, she accepted the friend request. The other party immediately sent an address and a password: 0823. It was indeed their anniversary.



Nyla rushed out of the house like a madman and drove to the address. It was an upscale apartment. She stood in front of the door, her finger hovering over the combination lock, her heart pounding.



She entered 0823, and the lock clicked and the door opened.



A men's suit jacket lay scattered in the hallway. She recognized it as the three-year anniversary gift she had given Clark, which Clark had worn when he left that morning.



A pair of black lace panties lay on the sofa in the living room, and a wine glass with a woman's lipstick stain on it lay on the coffee table.



From the hallway to the bedroom, men's and women's clothing was scattered everywhere. The most striking thing was a red lace nightgown, torn to shreds, lying by the bedroom door.



Nyla's legs were so weak she could barely stand, but she still trembled as she pushed open the half-open bedroom door. On the bed, Clark, naked, embraced another woman. The woman knelt on the bed, her head buried between Clark's legs, licking Clark's penis.



Clark's eyes were closed, his face a look of enjoyment, moaning, ""Yes, that's it, great...""



The woman asked proudly, ""Am I better, or is Nyla better?""



Clark replied, ""You think you can compare with Nyla, you little slut?""



Then he spun the woman around, grabbed her hips from behind, and thrust wildly. The woman's moans mingled with Clark's heavy gasps.



The scene completely devastated Nyla.



Eight years had passed, from their innocent college romance to their current marriage. Everyone had envied their love, saying they were a match made in heaven. But now, it all seemed so absurd. She covered her mouth, resisting the urge to vomit, and fled the nauseating place.



She drove to a bar downtown and sat alone in a corner, drinking furiously. The sharp taste of the whiskey stung her throat, but it couldn't numb the pain in her heart. When Valarie received her call and rushed to the bar, Nyla was already completely drunk.



""Nyla!"" Valarie's voice cut through her memories as she slid into the booth across from her, face etched with worry. ""Why are you so drunk? What happened? Did Clark make you mad?""



Drunk Nyla looked at her with red eyes. ""Val, I don't want to hear that name right now.""



Nyla took another swig of the whiskey in front of her, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth. ""Val, I saw him hooking up with that woman right in front of me. It's definitely not a misunderstanding.""



Valarie saw her friend's pained expression and held her hand with a heartache. ""Nyla, maybe you two can talk it out...""



""There's nothing to talk about,"" Nyla interrupted decisively. ""Divorce. Every time I think about him hooking up with that woman, I feel sick.""",1,1767077640.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

This morning I awoke with 8hrs of sleep (I sleep much better than I did just a year ago due to my increased fitness and excess weight loss. I also take trazodone for sleep and the typical C/L). 

Weighed myself in at an all time fat mass low, while my lean mass is increasing at over 81.5%. I drank coffee and ate a plant-forward breakfast with eggs. I will get plenty of protein throughout my day through a variety of sources... I am extremely focused on enhancing my gut biome- this means I eat a lot more vegetables, low inflammatory stuff, minimal processed foods. There is recent evidence that this keeps the alpha-synuclein at bay.

I will also write, and take a lesson or 2 in French with Duolingo- neuroplasticity is critical.

Later I will aggressively lift weights at my gym class, do some sprints on the treadmill, jump rope, and sauna.

This evening I will eat another thoughtfully crafted dinner and be done eating before 7pm. I will keep my calories to around 1650 or less today. Then I will communicate with family and friends, watch some Netflix, and then to bed with the same goal of sleeping for eight hours.

This is my daily fight. I don't say this to be insensitive to those of us who are farther along in their progression. I understand not everyone can do this, depending on your age and your progression. But I also know that MANY of us have AGENCY that we aren't maximizing- if you have young onset in particular....  you owe it to yourself to do everything that you can through exercise, guarding your sleep, and getting off the inflammatory diet in order to slow your progression.

Sara Rooter was buried beside her mother today. The funeral was nice, the gathering at Rooter’s after was alright. He won’t starve based off the sheer amount of deli trays and Pyrex pans in his fridge and deep freezer. I didn’t stay very long, it was too crowded for my liking and it was too hot to keep sitting in my black pantsuit in a packed house. 

A note for your benefit dear reader, I know that suit from the thrift store looks fantastic and you want something nice to wear to weddings, funerals and court but make sure it’s not wool. 

I haven’t been sleeping well, but that feels like a punchline or something. I never sleep well. I guess I’ve been sleeping worse since Sara was found. Remember that nightmare I kept having last week? I think I was seeing how Sara died. I know I sound nuts. I am nuts but this is different. I was Sara in those dreams.

 Since she was found, I’ve been dreaming about trails of ash. I’ll be in my kitchen, making a cup of coffee and there’s a trail leading from my bedroom to the front door when I turn around, or from the front of the shop, down the street. It’s always in the background of my nightmares, like I’m catching it out of the corner of my eye before I’m eaten or whatever is doing whatever to me at that moment. 

Today has been a lot, and I have to open early tomorrow. Karen is stopping in before she goes on vacation but she can’t possibly wait until I open at 9 am, no no, I must open at 7 am to accept her oils. I sold 2 vials last week to a guy who uses it for bug repellent. I don’t need another 3 boxes to sit in my storage. I’m going to shower and go to bed. 

**Monday, July 22nd 9:53 am**

I got up early. I opened early. But guess who doesn’t show up until 9-goddamn-30? 

Karen decided to sleep in before her road trip. If I could jump across the counter, I think I would have shoved those oils down her throat until she stopped wiggling. Demeter did hiss at her, so that makes me feel a little better. 

So she’s doing her usual speech as she unpacks the oils across my counter and telling me this one cures this, and this one alines that, and apparently oregano oil cures Rheumatism and you must rub it counter clockwise or it won’t work. I don’t know, I stopped listening after she started talking about metal detox. As my eyes slowly drifted apart during her droning, I finally noticed what she was wearing. In traditional middle aged mother fashion, she had on a cream blouse and cotton trousers in an obnoxious pastel shade, chunky sandals, even chunkier necklace, somehow even the chunkiest possible earrings, and something black smeared into the skin at the top shell of her ear. It kinda looks like when a cartoon character has smoke coming out of their ears and that thought deeply tickles me. 

“Karen… you have a smudge.” She doesn’t stop talking, she doesn’t even seem to hear me. So I repeat myself a little louder. “Karen, you have a smudge on your ear.”  Once again, I am ignored. With a sigh and the precision of a tired mother, I lick my thumb and reach across the counter to remove the black smudge on the flat of her ear. 

She freezes for a moment, and I think I see her eye twitch. The look of disgust on her face also tickles me pink. Something switches in her demeanor and she seems to ignore the fact I indirectly licked her ear. 

“This one is new from headquarters. It’s the start of a new line entirely! All our oils are safe to ingest but this is meant to be drank! I’ve been putting in my tea and my husband’s coffee every morning and we are just thriving!” She holds up a small amber bottle, and to humor her I take it. As soon as I touch it, I feel the oil on the outside. These stupid things always leak. 

“Jimsonweed, for mental clarity” The label has the same scrolling cursive as the rest of her crap, but the material feels different. They’re usually a shiny plastic label so if the oil dribbles over the side it’s got a fighting chance of staying, but this one is papery and crooked. They must really be rushing the market on this. 

“Thriving aye?” I mumble and hand it back, absentmindedly rubbing my hand dry on my pants. “If you say so… I’ll put it up when I go through the rest of your bottles. I’ll get your check.” I leave her and her pile of magical bottles of cure all at the counter to grab her check from the storage room. I hand the check off, and she goes on her merry way. 

**Monday, July 22nd, 8:12 pm**

The shop was pretty quite today, and I’m so so glad it was. Karen was the only one that came in, so no one saw my freak out. Or breakdown? Meltdown? I don’t know but it scared me. 

So about twenty minutes after Karen leaves, I’m sitting at the counter right? Demeter is tootling around, chasing rainbows from the sun catchers in the window. (Shout out to Cami who made them,  she’s our local tarot reading crystal lover and she makes theeee best saffron lattes) I’m filling out an inventory form for Rooter, and my hands start to shake a little. Ok, strange but not unheard of for the chronically ill. Maybe I need to eat, I’ll finish the form and get a snack real quick. No one will know I left. I return to my form, and the words are changing on me. I’m watching them change! The strokes of each letter are wriggling like tiny worms, pushing themselves across the paper. 

I don’t know how to upload photos on Reddit from my computer. I’m not tech savvy by any means so I can’t show you what the form is supposed to look like, bear with me ok? 

So this form is split into five sections. The top third of the page is for basic information like name of seller, address, phone number, date, those kinds of thing. The rest of the page is four columns, with the second one being the biggest. The first one is for the name of the item, the second is for the description, the third is for the quantity and the fourth is for the price per unit. 

So I’m filling this out for Rooter to drop off his check after work and the words start crawling to the middle of the page. They form a black mass in the center, writhing around in an undulating pile. I drop the pen and push myself away, my back hitting the wall. I know this isn’t real. It can’t be real. Words aren’t worms and they don’t come alive for fun. Slowly, they begin to untangle and spread out across the page again. 

“*Ash to ash, eye for eye. What was lost will be reclaimed. What was accrued will be repaid.""*

 In a wiggly, wormy font in the thickest column of the form. 

My legs give out from under me, and I slam my tailbone on the floor when I fall, sending a shockwave up my spine that instantly made me nauseated. I know words don’t move. Words can’t move, but those did. I watched them. 

Demeter peeks her head around the counter and trots over, rubbing her noggin against my leg and meeping about her rainbow hunt. As much as I want to pay attention, the nagging feeling in my stomach has started to crawl up. I grab the trash can from under the counter, and manage not to vomit on myself or the cat. When I finished, my ribs were sore from being hunched over for so long. 

I grab the counter and pull myself up on shaking legs. The worms have stopped moving on the paper, and the inventory form seems to be back in working order for Rooter. 

While testing my best impression of a newborn fawn, I hobble to the little bathroom by the stairs to rinse my mouth out. Before I flick on the light, I turn the tap on and slurp up a mouthful, swishing my mouth clean. I hit the switch as I straighten up and spit, like a multitasking queen as the kids say, and it’s black. Whatever I spit out, was black. My spit is black, there’s a greyish black…stuff smeared around my mouth, and whatever it was didn’t taste like stomach acid, it was almost like chewing on a pencil. Woody, metallic and absolutely fucking disgusting. I couldn’t get that flavor out of my mouth no matter how many times I swished and spat. 

I washed my face, and swished a few more times before I went back to the counter. Like I said, no one came in. When I closed the shop up, I still felt weird, and decided Rooter can wait for a day. I just wanted my bed and my cat. Demeter is curled up beside me while I type, keeping her big ol eyes trained on my face. It’s been a while since I broke like that, and I think she knows. 

I’m going to call Mr. Shriner and ask for the day off tomorrow.

 

**Wednesday, July 24th 6:49 pm**

I took yesterday off. Mr. Shriner didn’t answer when I called, but I decided to take it anyway. I was so sore when I woke up I couldn’t get myself out of bed. So, instead I slept all day. You know what’s weird though? I didn’t have a single nightmare. I didn’t have a weird dream either. I didn’t have any dreams at all. It was nothing but the sweet blackness of dead to the world sleep. 

I finally crawled from my cacoon of blankets at around five, and got dressed to take Rooter his check. Since they found Sara, he stopped leaving the house. Usually we don’t do drop offs, but I wanted to make sure he was alright. We’re not friends per-say, but I enjoyed our chats when he’d come in and it’s the least I could do. 

When I pulled in, the house was dark. When I knocked, he didn’t answer. I stuck the check in his little mail slot and peeked in while I was bent over. Still dark in there, and there was a smell. Like old air and… something plant like. Maybe he went somewhere after all. I wouldn’t want to stay alone like that either. 

I didn’t dream last night. I shut my eyes, fell into the abyss, and woke up with three little cat paws jammed in my neck hours later.

 Mr. Shriner called while I drank my coffee to apologize for Ian not showing up to collect the bank bag yesterday. I forgot that was the Tuesday thing. Oops. 

I decided to come clean and tell him I was “sick” and I wouldn’t have opened the door anyway. 

“Did you get that stomach bug too? God it’s horrible, tearing though the town like a plague. I’ve never seen a stomach bug cause such a fever. Ian was hallucinating smoking people or something… I wonder why people smoking scared him… he smokes too.” 

I lie again and tell him yes, I had the horrid fever inducing stomach bug. The old man wishes me well and hangs up, saying nothing about my day off. Win I guess. I dress myself in something cozy and toddle downstairs, my tailbone still sore from falling the other day. 

Ian pulled in at the same time I flipped my sign, looking like he did have a fever inducing stomach bug the day before. He was still rather unsteady, leaning on walls and the counter to support himself, and a pale cast on his face. 

“Hey Ian… if I knew you were still sick I could have dropped it off after work…” I quickly shake the money into the bag, keeping an eye on him in case he decides to keel over. I’d prefer he did that outside so his ghost isn’t kicking around in here for the rest of time. He shrugs as he looks around the store, his eyes settling on Demeter as she rolls in a pile of catnip. “Where’s her leg?” 

A quick story break for my sweet little cohort, I found Demeter in a dumpster behind my apartment back in Chicago. I know, classic story, but she was tiny and sick and I loved her little calico butt. When I got her to the vet, they said she had an infection in the bone of her front left leg and an astonishingly high fever. So I scraped together as much as I could and they took her leg. The infection left her mildly deaf, and with 3 and a half legs. Because I thought it was comedy gold, I named her Demeter Stix. Because De Meter stick has a little more then 3 feet. Buh dum Tis.

 I recounted all this to Ian as I have you and actually got a laugh from him. The rest of the visit went off without a hitch, but I did notice he needed to wash behind his ears. He had a black smudge up the back of it. I suppose I’ll forgive the transgression since he was sick. I guess I’ve become the smudge police.

**Friday, July 26th 11:23 pm**

Our quaint little town is throwing their plant festival next weekend and preparations are underway. Mr. Shriner even wrangled me into it this year. Usually, I push off the task to Ian but he’s going out of town I guess and Shriner obviously can’t do it so I must be the proprietor of our little stall. 

The plant festival has some long formal name that I can’t remember but it’s basically done to honor the forest that surrounds our town. The town was first settled as a logging camp, then turned into a….station I guess? It was still supposed to be mobile and easy to deconstruct but they ended up sticking around and built a few stores and an inn, then expanded to actual houses and a real saw mill. I don’t entirely understand what is so special about the woods because the trees look like the average kind of forest you’d expect around here. Even in the photos from when the mill was first built, they were processing standard sized trees. Nothing like what you’d see out west, just regular old trees. I heard once the trees grow really fast, and that’s why the saw mill was open for so long without decimating the forest. 

So, every year we have a festival to honor the forest. It’s pretty pagan for being a small midwestern town, with pyre burnings and offerings to the forest. And so many tchotchkes. Like… figures of little tree sprites, t-shirts, beer cozies, you name it, someone will make it with their cricut or their 3D printer thing. Our stall however, handles the kettle corn. Weird right? You’d think we sell something tchotchke-esque but nope. It’s good ol kettle corn. We do two flavors usually, but someone convinced Shriner to try a new one this year. So instead of caramel and cinnamon-caramel (and the difference is important here) we’re doing caramel and something called “Jed Mei’s snow”. I don’t know who Jed Mei is, and why his snow is special but Ian says it’ll kettle the corn nicely and now I have three big cartons of weird white powder in my storage closet. 

**Sunday, July 28th, 9:34 pm**

I finally seen Rooter today, but I almost didn’t recognize him. I had the day off, and needed to wash my sheets and get groceries so I bundled up my bedding and grabbed my fancy reusable bags that I usually forget, then headed for town. We have a laundry mat that’s run by a couple from the city, and they offer this really cool service where you drop off your laundry and they wash it for you for a couple bucks more then doing it yourself. If you bring your own soap, it’s even cheaper. I’m not inherently a busy person, but who has time to watch their laundry spin right? 

Sometimes I even sweeten the pot and bring overstock from the shop. They’re really into these soap bars Laura Laney makes so I give them some of the ones that don’t sell well, and I pay her out of my own pocket. It’s cheaper that way in the long run, I swear. 

So I dropped my laundry off and head for the market on the other side of town. I caught Rooter, or more specifically his truck, in the parking lot. I knew it was his truck, but the man sitting inside didn’t look a damn thing like our jolly woodcarver. 

He’s lost weight. A lot of weight. He was a rather large man, and now his cheeks are starting to sink. He’s got a sizable beard on him, and a weird tallowy color to his skin. Smudges of something covered his ears and under his nose, leaving a black tint on his newly sprouted stashe. This was not normal Rooter appearance.

But, I knew it was him when he lifted his hand to the wheel. Rooter, and a few other gentlemen in this town wear rings for some union thing their grandfathers were in back when the mill was in its prime. They’re exactly what you think they’d look like. Fat gold cigar bands with a square stone and the little emblem carved into it. The stone in this case is a dark green with a single, wicked looking tree carved into it.

I waved at him as I passed by, and he turned to look at me but didn’t really seem to look \*at\* me, you know? Maybe I need to stop in again.

Ben and Jerry’s was on sale, so that was cool but nothing else remarkable consumed my day off. 

**Monday, July 29th, 3:24 am**

The nightmares have finally returned, with a vengeance. Maybe they missed me. 

So I’m standing in the center of town during the festival, taking in the sights. Ian is at the kettle corn stand as usual, Mr. Shriner is making a speech with the rest of the chamber of commerce, kids squealing, haphazardly put together fair rides are playing their recorded calliope music. Absolutely picture perfect small town festival behavior.

 

I get a bag of kettle corn from Ian and I start munching on it, walking around to check out the stalls. My hands start to shake again, like they did the other day and the color of everything around me starts to mottle out. Faces are wiped away and replaced with this thick, black haze like a shroud.  

Black smoke starts leaking out of where their mouths and noses, filling the sky with thin streams of almost solid black clouds. Then these… I can’t even call them humans anymore, start to writhe around, collapsing to the ground in pain all at once. Their bodies start to disintegrate into ash and release more black smoke and I feel like I’m choking on it. I’m choking on them.

I jerked awake and ended up on the floor, choking on smoke from the dream world. Demeter hangs her fluffy little noggin over the bed and stairs down at me, bothered by the loss of her blankets as I accidentally took them with me to the floor. She merps and hops down, laying on the pile of blankets as I untangle myself. She drifts off again as I go to the bathroom for a drink. I flick on the light and flinch at the accidental flashbang I gave myself, but I can’t turn the light off again. I can still see the smoke rising from those… things. 

I don’t know how I managed to get dirty while sleeping, but there was something black in my ear. ",1,1767077450.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

""Nyla, are you sure you want me to draft a divorce agreement?"" Valarie's voice crackled through the phone, hesitant and worried. ""Think about it. Once you sign this, you and Clark will have nothing to do with each other anymore.""



Nyla stared at the amber liquid in her glass. The whiskey burned her throat, but nothing could burn away the images from last night. Her fingers tightened around the phone.



""Yes,"" she said finally. ""I'm leaving him.""



""Why?"" Valarie's confusion bled through the speaker. ""Clark's been so good to you. He loves you so much...""



Nyla almost laughed. Love. What a joke. She pressed her lips together, fighting back the bitter taste rising in her throat.



After hanging up, Nyla looked out the window. The massive LED screen on the skyscraper across the street was still playing that damn press conference. Clark stood there in his perfect suit, holding up that ridiculous jewelry piece.



Using the world's finest diamonds and gemstones, he had created a one-of-a-kind piece for his wife.



It was named ""Love Nyla.""



He named it after Nyla, declaring to the world his eternal love for her. Upon its release, ""Love Nyla"" instantly ignited social media discussion, remaining a hot topic.



The world was buzzing about their enviable love.



Outside, the LED screens continued to replay the video, but Nyla chuckled self-deprecatingly.



""Love me?"" she muttered to herself. ""Love me enough to sleep with another woman on our anniversary night?""



Last night was their third wedding anniversary. Clark had said he wanted to surprise her and asked her to wait for him at home. Nyla wore Clark's favorite white dress, lit candles, and prepared his favorite dinner, waiting eagerly until late at night.



She had waited. And waited. Midnight came and went.



At one in the morning, her phone suddenly buzzed with a Facebook friend request. A strange profile picture with the note ""A surprise for you.""



Nyla was about to reject the message outright, but then the person sent another message: \[Are you still awake? Is it because your husband isn't with you?\]



Nyla's alarm bells went off. How did this person know Clark wasn't home? She didn't accept the friend request, but the messages kept coming: \[Stop pretending, I know you're reading this.\]



\[Your husband is with me now.\]



\[I was scared of thunder, so he worried about me and came to keep me company.\]



\[What a good man, but it's a shame he's not good for you alone.\]



Each message stabbed Nyla like a knife in the heart. Her hands trembled. Her mind told her it might be a prank, but deep down, a voice frantically questioned it.



The last message completely broke her defenses: \[If you don't believe me, I'll send you the address. The door lock code is your wedding anniversary.\]



Nyla couldn't sit still any longer. With trembling fingers, she accepted the friend request. The other party immediately sent an address and a password: 0823. It was indeed their anniversary.



Nyla rushed out of the house like a madman and drove to the address. It was an upscale apartment. She stood in front of the door, her finger hovering over the combination lock, her heart pounding.



She entered 0823, and the lock clicked and the door opened.



A men's suit jacket lay scattered in the hallway. She recognized it as the three-year anniversary gift she had given Clark, which Clark had worn when he left that morning.



A pair of black lace panties lay on the sofa in the living room, and a wine glass with a woman's lipstick stain on it lay on the coffee table.



From the hallway to the bedroom, men's and women's clothing was scattered everywhere. The most striking thing was a red lace nightgown, torn to shreds, lying by the bedroom door.



Nyla's legs were so weak she could barely stand, but she still trembled as she pushed open the half-open bedroom door. On the bed, Clark, naked, embraced another woman. The woman knelt on the bed, her head buried between Clark's legs, licking Clark's penis.



Clark's eyes were closed, his face a look of enjoyment, moaning, ""Yes, that's it, great...""



The woman asked proudly, ""Am I better, or is Nyla better?""



Clark replied, ""You think you can compare with Nyla, you little slut?""



Then he spun the woman around, grabbed her hips from behind, and thrust wildly. The woman's moans mingled with Clark's heavy gasps.



The scene completely devastated Nyla.



Eight years had passed, from their innocent college romance to their current marriage. Everyone had envied their love, saying they were a match made in heaven. But now, it all seemed so absurd. She covered her mouth, resisting the urge to vomit, and fled the nauseating place.



She drove to a bar downtown and sat alone in a corner, drinking furiously. The sharp taste of the whiskey stung her throat, but it couldn't numb the pain in her heart. When Valarie received her call and rushed to the bar, Nyla was already completely drunk.



""Nyla!"" Valarie's voice cut through her memories as she slid into the booth across from her, face etched with worry. ""Why are you so drunk? What happened? Did Clark make you mad?""



Drunk Nyla looked at her with red eyes. ""Val, I don't want to hear that name right now.""



Nyla took another swig of the whiskey in front of her, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth. ""Val, I saw him hooking up with that woman right in front of me. It's definitely not a misunderstanding.""



Valarie saw her friend's pained expression and held her hand with a heartache. ""Nyla, maybe you two can talk it out...""



""There's nothing to talk about,"" Nyla interrupted decisively. ""Divorce. Every time I think about him hooking up with that woman, I feel sick.""

Coffee really helps calm me down, reduce my stress levels, help me focus. The only things that have a similar effect are constant exercise (not feasible in an office), and snacking all day (also not feasible). Tea, decaf, and water (just having something to sip on) are okay alternatives, but they don't calm me in the same way when I start to get anxious. 

But coffee also makes me get overstimulated a lot more easily. In the past 2 weeks I've had 3 anxiety attacks (sudden racing heartbeat, panic, feeling like everyone is too close, the sudden need to go home, etc), and I'm positive that the high amount of coffee I drink is a contributing factor.

I'm not sure what to do. I don't mind skipping coffee on stress-free days where I don't need to be productive, but I can't really cut it out otherwise. I've brought up ADHD (if that's related) to therapists before, and they all say its unlikely. Just now, the thought of cutting out coffee made me panicked and I drank a cup to calm down, haha.

1pzb4on,https://www.reddit.com/r/DWPhelp/comments/1pzb4on/turned_down_for_pip/,Turned down for PIP,"So I applied for PIP in August and had my assessment at the beginning if December. I've been reading posts on here and called for my assessment report before knowing the decision.

I got the assesment recorded both by the assessor and I recorded myself on my end and let them know this.

Everything within the report goes against what i told the assessor and she just grabbed the tiniest bits of information and decided oh because I can put toast in the toaster that would get burnt I can cook a whole meal for myself.

It was also stated i do not have any mental health professional involvement even though i stressed i did more then once. I also stated i was nervous so many times to which she wrote didnt show signs of distress.

I also have children and it was stated throughout because I didnt have social services involvement i am able to take care of all of there needs which is untrue my partner is amazing support literally would have social involvement without him!!!

So basically when I called for my report my partner was making himself a coffee i had left my phone playing the hold music in the kitchen as I didnt know how long I was going to be on hold for also I was playing with my daughter.

Long story short i got my report through and it stated in a section under the title ""General appearance and informal observations""
That i:
Awnsered all the security questions. Without any input. Bare in mind I was on a telephone call. No one could see if I was reading from a piece of paper. I wasn't because I have seemingly amazing memory for numbers and addresses such as my home address I have lived at for years and my own date of birth 😂.

It also states I was heard cooking.
My partner making a cup of coffee doesn't warrant them assuming im cooking. Cooking is something i literally cannot do.

My question basically is.

Can they use the phone call where I was on hold to listen to what I am doing? Is this recorded and can it be used against me at all in the tribunal stage? 

I am going to fight the decision as the report was inaccurate to anything i had told this woman carrying out my assessment. 

And information would be much appreciated.

After such disappointment, 2 days back, I thought to try order directly from the roaster **Tulum** and got it today morning through Bluedart and it seems a viable option going forward.

And I'm glad I did, this film was fkn sick

Mostly because it feels real, and feels actual Australian, not from the ""outback Australia"" type Australian, but city and suburbs, real Aussie relationships, grabbing 2 50s off your brother, lines and a quick root in the bathroom of the bar, girl at the coffee shop knows you and spins a yarn, Australian public transport hahahah 
It's nice to see.

And it's not supernatural, it's a fella gone skitzo, even the way he stabs the people he murders feels and sounds legit, the actresses are good at dying lol, and the force and motion the unit uses to act out the murders actually seems real,

(Punishment from the Buddhist gods)
—and how to get over it
(Parody deprogramming guide)

⸻

😈 WHY THE FEAR SHOWS UP (PARODY PSYCHOLOGY)
	1.	You Were Trained to Treat Routine as Reality
Miss the routine → reality must retaliate.
(Spoiler: reality didn’t get the memo.)
	2.	Repetition Installed a Ghost Cop
No sirens. No badge.
Just an internal voice saying, “You know better.”
	3.	Cause-and-Effect Was Weaponized
Anything bad = proof.
Anything good = confirmation.
Coincidence retired early.
	4.	Fear Was Framed as “Respect”
Anxiety in a robe still counts as anxiety.
	5.	Silence Was Labeled Dangerous
So when it’s quiet, your brain fills the gap with gods carrying clipboards.

⸻

🧠 WHAT BATSU FEAR ACTUALLY IS (PARODY TRANSLATION)

Not divine punishment.
Not cosmic retribution.

It’s conditioned anticipation—
the mental flinch you get when you step outside a script.

Like missing a bell in high school and waiting for detention…
at age 40…
in your kitchen.

⸻

🧯 HOW TO GET OVER THE FEAR (PARODY, STEP BY STEP)

1. Run the Experiment

Skip gongyo once.
Observe the universe.
	•	Did lightning strike?
	•	Did your coffee curdle?
	•	Did traffic personally target you?

No?
Log that.

⸻

2. Delay the Panic

When the fear pops up, say:

“If batsu is real, it can wait 24 hours.”

Fear hates deadlines.

⸻

3. Stop Retroactive Blame

Stubbed toe?
Missed text?
Bad mood?

Refuse the sentence:

“This is because I didn’t chant.”

That sentence is the spell.

⸻

4. Notice the Pattern

BATSU always shows up before anything happens.
Never after.
Never with receipts.

Suspicious.

⸻

5. Replace the Ritual with Reality

Do something undeniably real:
	•	Eat
	•	Walk
	•	Sleep
	•	Breathe

The body does not recognize batsu.
That’s important data.

⸻

6. Shrink the Gods

In parody terms:
If Buddhist gods need attendance tracking and fear enforcement…
they’re middle management, not deities.

⸻

7. Let Fear Be Boring

Don’t argue with it.
Don’t fix it.
Don’t chant it away.

Just say:

“Ah. The old program.”

And keep going.

⸻

🧨 THE TURNING POINT (PARODY TRUTH)

BATSU only has power before you test it.

After a few missed gongyos with no punishment:
	•	Fear weakens
	•	Your body relaxes
	•	The gods mysteriously retire

Nothing dramatic replaces it.

Just calm.

⸻

☢️ FINAL PARODY VERDICT

Fear of batsu survives on:
	•	imagination
	•	repetition
	•	never checking

It dies the moment you calmly notice:

Nothing is enforcing this.

No gods.
No punishment.
No cosmic hall monitor.

Just an old habit,
running on borrowed electricity.

And once you stop plugging it in—
it goes quiet.

My family and I went on a road trip to NYC this weekend to visit relatives. My parents contributed by covering gas and buying food here and there for our family.

While we were out exploring the city, I paid for our families’ subway tickets, brunch, and later the grocery bill. In total, I spent around $200 and covered my sister’s expenses the entire time. I didn’t mind paying for her since she’s in college and I understand money is tight. (It’s important to note that she doesn’t pay tuition or housing at college because she has a full ride and she also worked full time over the summer. Her only expenses are groceries and even then, my parents send her money every now and then and they gave her $3,000 at the start of the college year.

After grocery shopping, I wanted a latte and we stopped at a coffee shop. I asked my sister if she could buy me one. She immediately got upset and said it wasn’t her idea to get coffee and that she needed to save her money because she’s in college and she has groceries to pay for. She stormed out of the coffee shop mad at me and so I paid for my own latte and went back to the car. We drove home in silence.

Once we got home, I received a $7 Zelle from a cookie I had bought for her earlier. That made me so upset because I didn’t ask for repayment. She made me feel like I was money hungry when all I asked was for her to buy me a latte.

I then confronted her and I told her that it wasn’t about the money. I didn’t have a problem paying for her expenses, but when she couldn’t get me a simple latte and even got mad at me for asking for it, that really made me upset.

I’ve always been nice to her, taking her out to eat, to the movies and never asked anything in return. I didn’t expect repayment. I’m more hurt by the way she reacted.

1pzb0cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pzb0cc/was_it_a_date/,Was it a date?,"So my male best friend and I have been friends for about five years, since my first year of uni when I met him, in 2020. In 2022 I got with my ex, and my friend (let's call him F) knew everything leading up to it, and met my ex as well. They got along okay, my ex only met each of my friends once, and my girlfriends did not like him, but F never really said anything about him. Ex and I broke up multiple times until the final one in October this year.

F and I hang out a lot. F's sister is also one of my closest friends as well. It was to the point where F's students thought we were dating in undergrad (he was a TA in a different faculty). No boundaries were ever crossed, no cheating. We have been hanging out a lot since 2020, nothing new. I am his closest woman friend outside of his sister, and we tell each other about our dating/sex lives etc because we are close friends. 

We both came back to our hometown for Christmas, and we've been hanging out a lot, mostly with his sister there as well. 

Today, he invited me to the gym with him. We are both pretty huge gym rats. While at the gym, we both hit back and switched between sets, with him fixing my form, helping me do the last reps, and switching the weights. Staying with me the whole time, which I guess is something he does not usually do. One of his gym friends while we were leaving, told him ""looks like you're the comedian now."" Which I assume refers to guys making girls laugh etc. After the gym, we got coffee and just talked for 2 hours. Also, he took my lip gloss and was playing with it and I watched him put it in the centre console of his car, and I didn't pick it up because I'll be able to get it tomorrow anyways as the two of us are going skating.

Did that count as a date? I *think* he likes me a bit, but at the same time we have been good friends for a while and he might just be trying to maximize the time we have together before we have to go back this week. But at the same time it's the types of dudes at the gym who will assume that if a guy is with a girl he's definitely pulling moves on her. 

And then also, does that make tomorrow a date? We're going skating together.

(If it feels more comfortable, you’re welcome to bring a family member)

I work at a Maldivian start-up & lead a small team of twenty people from different nationalities. I keep my professional and personal life separate, which is why work hasn’t been a place to meet someone. I haven’t actively searched for anyone here since like 2019, so I don't know how people actually meet these days, but I’m clear and intentional. I'm not here to waste time. 

Outside of work, I actually enjoy learning languages (Arabic, French, Japanese), travelling, geeking out on history and experiencing different cultures. I take a six-week paid break each year around June/July and often spend that time living abroad. I can work remotely, am open to relocating if needed. I prefer a low-key, private life where most of my friends and family don't even know what I do for work. I am already done with my postgraduate studies, if that would matter to you. 

Sometimes, I have to travel outside of Male for work as well which is kinda nice, and it made me appreciate and read more about our unique Maldivian history and culture. 

I’m attracted to someone who has humility, kind, and someone with her own sense of direction, even if she’s still figuring it out. I appreciate meaningful or interesting conversations and being present (as in the ability to hold a conversation without needing to scroll halfway through lol). I really value good intention and emotional maturity from a partner, emotional intelligence is key for me. Someone who would like an active or a healthy lifestyle. 

I’d prefer to meet a Muslim girl, or someone genuinely open to learning about Islam. I take Islam seriously so I’m not interested in anything casual or physical. My intention is marriage down the line, calmly and respectfully. Idea is know each other over the course of a few dates, let things to grow naturally if there is mutual compatibility.

I have a really tight schedule for most of January but I'll be free maybe 2 or 3 nights. Hence the short notice on the date. But if you'd be interested to do this another night too, lmk. I might be free and interested.

1pzavsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/advancedentrepreneur/comments/1pzavsz/data_filtering_crash3_rules_to_keep_your_system/,Data filtering crash?3 Rules to Keep Your System Rock-Solid Under Traffic,"Last year's Black Friday, our FB advertising system collapsed directly. 100,000 users poured in at the same time, the data screening delay soared to 15 seconds, and the conversion rate plummeted by 60%. This kind of pain is understood by cross-border sellers.

 

When a large amount of data rushes into the server, the high-concurrency scenario occurs, which brings us three major fatal injuries:

Real-time interaction paralysis: When live streaming, user behavior data piles up, and the traditional system is directly stuck

Cold start for new users: 30% of the traffic that pours in during the promotion is wasted because it cannot be identified immediately

Data cleaning lag: The cleaning report can only be obtained 3 days after the end of the event, and the competitor has already adjusted its strategy. We simply can't catch up.

 

The solution we give is dynamic tiering. Specifically, traffic grading, real-time cleaning rules, and balancing intelligent loads.

The first is traffic tiering. We divide customers into high-frequency users to go directly to the VIP channel, and new users trigger the quick verification process, using mobile phone number and email double verification. This unblocks data channels.

 

Establish specific rules for real-time cleaning. First, it is necessary to automatically reject robot traffic. And carry out real-time interception of risky transactions, such as placing multiple orders on the same IP in a short period of time is a warning sign that needs to be paid attention to. TNTwuyou provides massive data screening services to save more time.

 

Intelligent load balancing is also an important point. Automatically allocate requests based on server pressure, and we start backup channels when the pressure > 80% to reduce the pressure on each channel. And the system I use will automatically expand during the event, which is much lower than the traditional cloud solution.

 

In addition, there are some things that need to be planned and executed in advance. Stress test 2 weeks in advance to simulate 1.5 times peak flow. Establish a real-time monitoring dashboard with key indicators updated in 5 minutes. Set an automatic circuit breaker mechanism to suspend non-core services when the error rate > 5%.

 

Now we can easily cope with millions of concurrency, and during this year's Black Friday marketing, our O&M personnel only need to drink coffee to monitor the data. After this project, I deeply remember a rule: in the peak of traffic, a stable data screening system is your money printing machine.",1,1767076515.0,advancedentrepreneur,1,1.0,False
1pzavpy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzavpy,Help with my coffee plant,"Hey, I’ve had this coffee plant since June and slowly it began to shed leaves so I repotted her to a bigger pot and I switched her to miracle gro organic soil (which produced gnats) so I added cinnamon and that got under control but it continued to shed leaves. So i repotted again to fox farms soil and added perlite. I also started using a grow light started at 8 hrs and am now doing 12 hrs . She seemed to be doing better but now suddenly she started developing brown spots on one of her leaves and now she’s down to four leaves as compared to the multiple shoots when I got her. I also have a cup of water near her for the humidity and I have her planter inside of a decorative pot and inside that decorative pot I have some rocks w some water inside to also help with humidity. Lately I’ve been watering about every week and a half to about two weeks because her soil feels too moist. But she’s developing more dry spots and I’m really worried if anyone could help or give advice on what I should do I would really appreciate it.

I fear I’ve been over watering her and so I just added more dry soil near her roots with additional perlite mixed in and I’m think of removing her off the decorative pot for a few days just to see if that helps

And some of her leaves I’ve trimmed just to help redirect energy

Every year I always have to guess on when my last chance for eggnog season will be to stock up. I like both the alcohol variety and the dairy case stuff - I add them to my coffee in different amounts.

Last year my local Trader Joe's overstocked their alcohol eggnog and they had it into March so I felt confident I'd be able to get some today. The first store I went to was Wal-Mart and they were already out of dairy case eggnog but I saw they had Christian Brothers in their liquor section while looking for St. Germain (they didn't have it).

Next I went to a Grocery Outlet where I did find some dairy case eggnog of a kind I've never had before: Darigold. I'm sure it will be fine, all the brands are pretty much the same. I was surprised at Trader Joe's. Not only were they out, they said they'd been out since before Chridtmas. I guess they really didn't want to have it until March again so they ordered a lot less this season.

Next I went into a Win-Co and they usually get a few kinds of alcohol eggnog but they were already all out too. There was nothing to do but go to Wal-Mart for the Christian Brothers. I got four bottles.",7,1767076346.0,PointlessStories,3,0.9,False

We talked about marriage, building a future, the whole thing. She was my best friend and I genuinely thought she was my person (& I still do).

She broke up with me about a month ago saying she needs to figure out who she is outside of our relationship. She's starting a new job, moving to a new city - basically her whole life is changing and she said she can't properly transition into this new chapter while being in a relationship with me.

I get it in theory. But it's been really confusing because:

* She still tells me I'm her ""dream partner"" and that ""we could still get married one day""
* She's called me a few times when she needed emotional support 
* We've agreed to monthly phone calls to ""stay in touch""
* She said we'll get coffee when she moves to my city but made it VERY clear that doesn't mean we're getting back together
* She admitted she almost texted me on Christmas but stopped herself

The mixed signals are killing me. On one hand, she's saying she needs space and doesn't want to date anyone. On the other hand, she's keeping me in her life just enough that I can't fully move on.

**My question for people who've been through something similar:**

**For those whose ex said they needed to ""find themselves"" - did they ever come back? How long did it take? Did the relationship work the second time?**

**And for those who stayed in contact with an ex while trying to heal - did it help or make things worse?**

I'm trying to move forward with my life (dating other people, going to therapy, focusing on my career) but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping she realizes what we had and wants to try again eventually.

Am I being naive? Is she stringing me along? Or is this genuinely someone who needs time and might come back when she's ready?",1,1767076253.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

# ☕ Drink options (a lot, actually)

The Magenta offers **13 beverages**, which covers pretty much everything a household would need:

* Coffee-based: ristretto, espresso, lungo, americano, coffee, over ice
* Milk drinks: cappuccino, flat white, latte macchiato, café au lait, cortado
* Hot water for tea

What I liked is that it’s not just “push button, accept fate.” You can tweak:

* Temperature
* Aroma intensity
* Pre-infusion
* Shot size (including an x2 option)
* Even use ground coffee when needed

For a super-auto, that’s solid flexibility.

# 🧠 Smart interface (without being annoying)

The full-color display with capacitive buttons is clean and intuitive. No app required, no account creation, no nonsense.  
You can:

* Access settings directly
* Run cleaning cycles easily
* Adjust the ceramic grinder (5 steps)

It feels modern but not over-engineered.

# 🧊 Milk system & premium touches

The **integrated milk carafe** is probably the highlight if you drink milk-based drinks regularly:

* Automatic
* Easy to clean
* Holds up to 0.5L

Other nice details:

* Adjustable coffee spout (fits small cups or taller glasses)
* Stainless steel espresso tray
* Over-ice coffee option (actually useful, not a gimmick)

# 🇮🇹 Design & build

* Made in Italy
* Compact footprint (22.5 × 36 × 43.5 cm)
* Glazed grey body with black accents

It looks understated but premium — doesn’t scream “tech appliance” on your counter.

# ⚖️ The honest take

* Very convenient
* Good customization for a super-auto
* Excellent milk drinks
* Clean design and solid build

The long story: I did an extremely rare Ikea shop last week and got a glass lamp sconce. I got it home, took it out of the box and it shattered into a million pieces. Ikea was willing to replace it, but only via in person exchange. A friend was visiting Van for holidays and got me a replacement lamp, but they sadly got the wrong size and neither of us realized there were 2 options. Ikea is not willing to ship it here since it was bought in person. 

Now I'm wondering if anyone is doing an Ikea run in the next week or two who would be able to exchange it for the right size? Third times the charm!? Would be happy to compensate for your time and energy with food, cash or coffee. I can't give up on this sconce as it was a matching set (bought separately) and I have one set up!

I’m a friendly person so, I always communicate with all my colleagues to just get to know them and just have a happy work environment. So, that’s what I did with him as well. Just normal chats until one day, he asked if I had a boyfriend. I said no and then he asked if I was down for coffee as “friends” (why would he ask if I have a bf if he wants to be just friends?). At the time, I was caught so off guard as I never expected anything from him so I told him I was busy all month but he insisted no timelines or deadlines, it’s whenever I want and he wouldn’t leave without an answer so, to not make the workplace awkward, I just said sure in hopes that he’ll probably forget before the month ends or simply just move on. However, he asked for my number and waited until I had to leave work so I could give it to him. I would get a few texts here and there to which I would mostly ignore or give one-word responses and would ignore him as much as I could at work but for some reason, he didn’t get the hint. He asked why I was acting so distant and I just told him I’ve just been busy. He then asked which cafes I prefer so when he takes me out, he can plan. Recently, he found my snap and decided to request. 

I have no idea how to tell him to back off. He’s way older than me and I thought he was interested in men so I never got weird or uncomfortable vibes from him until he asked those two questions and now is always trying to text after work. He also mentioned that a girl from his other work reported him for sexual harassment but claims that “she was the one texting him at like 3am.” And that I should tell him if I’m ever uncomfortable instead of going to HR.

Generally, I really like gothic scents that aren’t super heavy on incense, and while I do enjoy incense, strong incense makes me nauseas sadly. I’m searching for a scent with red wine, velvet, rose, pomegranate, and chocolate that’s fresh like rain. I don’t want anything overly sweet and bonus if it has animalic or metallic notes. The rain part is very important to me, it doesn’t have to be super fresh, it just has to be *there.* 

I’ve been having a pretty hard time finding scents that are rich and luxurious and gothic while also being kind of fresh. People also tell me that coffee and vanilla smell really good on me however I’ve been trying to stray away from overly sweet smells because I quite prefer my signature scent to be something that repels others. A few perfumes I’ve tried that I really like are Dior’s Hypnotic Poison, YvesSaintLaurent’s Black Opium, Pineward’s Juniperus, and Pineward’s Velvetine.

I found Pineward’s stuff to be too strong for me, as I have a sensitive nose, even with one spray. I really liked the scents, I just couldn’t tolerate them for more than a few hours.

1pzanl1,https://i.redd.it/bff9d7gebaag1.jpeg,The Woman Who Died as Someone’s Wife and Lived as Her Revenge,"Chapter 1 At her father-in-law’s funeral, Elina saw a woman named Ava in head-to-toe black, keeping vigil as if she were Trent’s wife.

Only then did she learn that Trent Harrison had another home in Midtown Manhattan—with his long-cherished “one that got away.”

The day she asked for a divorce, Trent brought Ava back with him.

“She’s one of us,” he said.

Trent casually tugged Ava down beside him.

Elina nodded, calm as ever. She took a document from her bag and slid it across the table.

“There’s about a billion and a half on the card. Sign the divorce papers.”

Trent arched a brow.

A tabloid lay beneath the agreement, splashing how Ava had shown up at the funeral in grand fashion and publicly humiliated Mrs. Harrison.

“Elina, when are you going to stop with these schoolgirl theatrics?”

“Seven years. You’ve threatened divorce twenty times. Still not done playing?”

His tone was lazy as he fished a black card from his bag and flicked it onto the table.

“If it’s not enough, see Sam, my assistant. The company’s swamped. Call if you need something.”

Elina didn’t take the card. Her gaze drifted, cool and brief, to the woman in his arms.

The women Trent chased over the years all looked like Ava.

She could guess why Ava had come back to the city and why he still hadn’t made it official.

The role of “Mrs. Harrison” isn’t for the woman he loves; it’s for the woman who fits.

“You want her wearing the ‘homewrecker’ label for you?”

Elina nudged the divorce agreement closer.

Ava’s brows pinched; the word stung. Her voice was soft and sweet.

“Miss Foster, the one who isn’t loved is the real other woman.”

Trent chuckled, saying nothing.

His hand slid around Ava’s waist, giving a light squeeze. Only then did he look over at Elina, unhurried.

“Don’t be late to the morning meeting.”

Elina didn’t look away until his figure disappeared down the hall.

No one—including Trent—believed she would ever truly let him go.

\*\*\*

Seven years ago, the New York tabloids ran their only straight headline: “After Two Years of Pursuit, They Finally Got Together.”.

He gave her a lavish, talk-of-the-city wedding and a vice president title at F&S, and he turned a former pageant queen stuck in bit parts into a society wife.

She was obedient, beautiful, and well-behaved—by most measures, a pleasing wife and daughter-in-law.

Elina tried to recall how Trent had once loved her, but the memory felt blurred and foreign.

Now she was just tired.

“Linda.”

The Harrisons’ housekeeper came over.

“We’re doing brunch at The Plaza tomorrow. Please send the gown under the bed in the primary bedroom to Ms. Carter in Midtown.”

“And swap out these red roses in the morning.”

Elina pinched off the rosebud.

At some point, Trent had replaced her favorite jasmine with red roses.

Tacky, like his taste in women.

If Ava wanted the Mrs. Harrison seat, Elina would give her a push.

Whether she could keep it would be up to her.

When Elina arrived at The Plaza the next day, Trent’s mother sat at the head of the table, a polished strand of prayer beads turning in her hand.

“Mom,” Elina said.

Elina greeted her and had the gifts she’d brought back from Las Vegas set on the table.

Mrs. Harrison’s eyes flicked to Elina’s stomach; her voice stayed cool.

“Seven years and not a hint of a pregnancy. No wonder you can’t keep a man.”

“I guess I haven’t earned the blessing to carry a child yet.”

Elina smiled and poured her a cup of coffee.

As daughters-in-law go, Elina was excellent in every way—except for that one.

A burst of commotion sounded at the entrance.

Mrs. Harrison looked over again.

She took in the clothes Ava was wearing and frowned.

Even Elina at her worst was better than a buxom bottle-service hostess.

The moment Ava sat down, a ripple of low laughter rolled through the guests.

Before Ava could figure out what was happening, a stylish young woman clicked in on four-inch stilettos.",1,1767075749.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I follow about 30 channels for work (AI, Tech, Marketing). The problem is, keeping up with them feels like a part-time job. I was spending 2 hours a day watching videos just to find the 5 minutes of actual signal.

The Solution (Recapio Recaps): I built a ""Daily Feed"" that treats YouTube channels like an RSS reader, but for summaries.

How it works:

It monitors my selected channels (e.g., Huberman, YC, The Verge).

When a new video drops, it auto-generates a structured summary (Key Insights, Arguments, Action Items).

It pushes it to a clean ""Recap Feed"" so I can skim 10 videos in 5 minutes over coffee.

The Result: My ""Watch Later"" playlist is finally empty. I only click ""Play"" on the videos that are actually worth the deep dive.

It’s a work in progress. Would love to know if you guys prefer this ""Feed"" view or if you'd rather have these sent as a morning email?
