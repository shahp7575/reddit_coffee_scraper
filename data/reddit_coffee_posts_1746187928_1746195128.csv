1kd1vvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kd1vvt/explore_the_keurig_kiced_coffee_maker_review_does/,Explore the Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker Review: Does It Truly Brew Perfect Iced Coffee?,"**Unboxing and Initial Impressions**  
Having tested the Keurig 5000371871 K-Iced Coffee Maker daily for a few weeks now, I can confidently say it offers plenty of smart features bundled in a compact design. From initial unboxing, the sleek gray finish immediately caught my eye—modern yet subtle, it fits seamlessly into my kitchen. Measuring 12.9""D x 5.1""W x 12.6""H, its slim profile saves counter space, a huge win for someone constantly battling appliance real estate. Despite its lightweight construction at 4.4 pounds, it feels sturdy, and its fully automatic operation is a breeze to set up.  

The included 42oz removable reservoir is quite user-friendly. As someone who despises frequent refills, this reservoir lets me brew several cups before needing a top-up, which feels especially handy during morning rush hours. The water filter capability is a bonus for ensuring every cup carries a clean and fresh flavor.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Efficient Brew Over Ice function keeps iced coffee vibrant, not watered down.  
- Strong Brew enhances boldness for those intense coffee moments.  
- Multiple cup sizes offer versatility (8, 10, 12oz) for varying preferences.  

[Check Keurig 5000371871 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bsmgnyn3/)  

**Performance That Stands Out**  
The performance is where this coffee maker shines. The Brew Over Ice setting is a lifesaver for an iced coffee lover like myself. It starts brewing at a higher temperature, extracting rich flavors from the K-cup before cooling down to minimize ice melt. No more watered-down iced coffee, even after a long sip-and-sit session! The Strong Brew setting has been another personal favorite, as I love a bold cup early in the morning. Both functions are accessible via intuitive buttons, and the machine operates quietly enough that it won’t disrupt a household at dawn.

Timing matters too. Brewing your choice of iced or hot coffee takes just a few minutes. It’s fast, and the freshness of the coffee is noticeable. Although it’s marketed as compatible with K-Cup pods, I paired it with the My K-Cup Universal Coffee Filter (sold separately) for brewing my ground coffee, which worked flawlessly. This versatility makes the machine even more impressive.  

**User-Friendly Features You’ll Appreciate**  
User experience has clearly been considered in its design. The adjustable cup sizes accommodate most preferences, but more importantly, the removable drip tray supports travel mugs up to 7 inches tall. As someone often rushing out the door, being able to brew directly into my tumbler is a lifesaver. Plus, the drip tray catches any overflow, making cleanup painless.  

The energy efficiency feature automatically shuts the coffee maker off five minutes after your last brew. For someone prone to forgetting appliances are still running (who hasn’t been there?), this is a reassuring touch.  

**Where It Stumbles**  
While it’s a fantastic product, no device is without its quirks.  

*Areas of Concern:*  
- The 42oz water reservoir can feel slightly small for heavy users brewing multiple cups daily.  
- Limited cup-size options (8, 10, and 12oz) might disappoint those needing a larger-sized beverage.  
- Lack of included accessories like a starter My K-Cup Filter could be a missed opportunity.  

**Market Rivals to Consider**  
This Keurig model stands strong against competitors, but it’s worth noting its position compared to options like the Nespresso Vertuo and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Nespresso Vertuo, while delivering premium espresso, lacks the robust iced coffee functionality that Keurig excels in. Meanwhile, Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers dual brewing (single-serve and full pot), which this model doesn’t, yet it doesn’t specialize in iced coffee as effectively.  

Where this machine truly sets itself apart is with its Brew Over Ice feature—no other coffee maker I’ve tested nails the process of creating iced coffee with such precision. The Nespresso Vertuo may cater better to intense espresso fans, but when iced and hot versatility is needed, Keurig takes the crown.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Judging this coffee maker’s value for money boils down to its specialty: ease, versatility, and quality. Despite a few nitpicks regarding reservoir size and cup-size offerings, its dual-temperature operations make it worth the investment. My household appreciates the ability to brew both a piping hot cup and a chilled iced one in the same machine. Add features like the reusable coffee filter compatibility and energy efficiency, and it becomes evident that the machine is geared toward convenience and performance.

1kd1upm,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1kd1upm/long_beach_downtown_better_than_the_westin_long/,Long Beach Downtown (better than the Westin Long Beach),"Recently finished 5 nights at LBD. Hotel has been renovated so it feels more modern. I usually stay half a block away at the Westin but wanted M Lounge access and to try it out. Glad I did. Westin is tired. Their lobby is nice but rooms need a Reno. Popcorn ceilings if that’s an indication. LBD room was smooth ceilings, modernist appointments. It was better.  Had some friends at the Westin and to be sure checked out their room. Still tired. 

This is a 12 floor hotel and my Titanium “upgrade” got me on floor 11. It’s kind of amazing how every single hotel I stay in is “completely booked” and no actual upgrades available. As such, I was bit annoyed when a colleague whose WIFE is Ambassador (and not even there) got a nicer room with terrace. Seriously Marriott needs to get their heads out of their asses. 

Bathroom lighting for the ladies is adequate. There is a built in magnifier mirror in the main mirror, which works if you are 4’0. I’m 5’9 so I didn’t bother trying to use it. No foot shelf in shower for shaving those legs. 

Room itself was quiet. I didn’t hear my next door neighbors nor footsteps from anyone on the floor above. Rooms are carpeted. There is a bay window with cushions which was a nice touch 

Bed wasn’t terribly comfortable. Bathroom smelled faintly like sewage the whole time. Thought it was my mind playing tricks on me but then a colleague told me that on his floor (4) he woke to horrendous smell. Walking to elevators he saw an industrial clean up hose and the sewage smell hit like a truck. He saw two back to back rooms with the actual sewage back up in the showers and floors.  Take from that what you will but def avoid floor 4 rooms. I’m thinking it’s highly likely the smell in my bathroom was related. They gave me some points to compensate. 

I had a Queen Mary view. Try to get a room with windows facing Ocean Blvd. Otherwise it is rooftops. Hotel location is walkable to lots of restaurants, the Promenade, Pike Place, Convention Center etc. 

Lounge was fine. Typical American breakfast fare but some California bougie upgrades like fresh watermelon juice, chia fruit bowls, yogurt mixes with fresh fruit etc. Only did eve one time and it’s the usual pre-packaged finger food fare like spring rolls and chips etc. Coffee machine offers lattes and the like.  

Bar in the main area is nicely situated and friendly bartenders. Food seemed way overpriced especially given all the restaurants nearby. Didn’t eat there. 

Parking is free. Yes. Free and in a covered garage. Major Bonus points for that. 

Overall I would give LBD a 7. Decent as a business traveler. Better than the Westin. Glad I got to bounce on a Friday as the weekend warriors were heading in and they tend to be missing the gene that allows them to realize that other people exist around them.

1kd1ul8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1kd1ul8/another_beginner_stuck_at_the_same_question/,Another beginner stuck at the same question,"So, I asked about upgrading my french press set up a couple of days ago and was recommended a C2s grinder + an aeropress combination and I have been researching a lot about it. 

While I am sold on the c2s grinder and already ordering it, I am not quite sure about the aeropress.   
The main thing about it is that kaldipress also seems really good and the main issue everyone seems to have with it is the rubber but I can get a aeropress rubber from something brewing for 600/-.   
Also, with that money I can buy a metal filter ( can someone please link a good one ) or maybe buy a good coffee mug. The point is I am not sure if I should go for the aeropress because kaldi is also BPA free and I can just replace the rubber and get the same result? 

Also, would love to know if there is something else I need and a couple of recommendations for whole beans to start with - I love a medium roast.",1,1746194866.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1kd1sid,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1kd1sid/setting_boundaries/,Setting Boundaries,"A few months ago a former friend asked to connect again.
We had a business disagreement a few years ago and went our separate ways. I’d told her I’d be interested in being friends again and continue business stuff separately to maintain the relationship.

Anyways she recently opened up in a new space and invited me to join. I already have a space that’s working for me and I already learned I don’t want to share in a business venture with her. We had coffee a few times, and went on a nice walk one day. I continued telling her I enjoy coffee but I’m not looking for a new space for my practice. She accepted my no, and has been pretty busy with getting things set up. So I haven’t seen her in a while now.

She’s not taking steps to hang out. But she does do other things herself like stuff with her family, Pilates classes, martial arts classes. Everyone makes time for what’s most important to them. I know as adults that time can be quite limited. So I respect that choice.

And I’m not taking steps to do business together. I’m holding to that. It’s hard feeling like the coffees were more about her trying to get me on board. I have had so many people be warm to me whenever they want something. I’ve learned that lesson. She’s not a bad person, just not a friend either. She asked me to come check out the space this week. But I declined. After inviting her several times to go walking, she’s never had the time. So no I don’t have the time for her purposes either.

I’m holding the boundary! I want friends! No more business stuff. ",1,1746194717.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

1kd1rnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureInGermany/comments/1kd1rnw/riding_the_rails_in_germany_a_guide_to_deutsche/,Riding the Rails in Germany: A Guide to Deutsche Bahn Travel,"# Ever Wondered What a German Train Journey Is Like?

Taking a long-distance journey by train in Germany is a blend of efficiency, comfort, and cultural norms. The **Deutsche Bahn**, Germany’s national railway, offers various services, with the **ICE (Intercity Express)** trains leading as the flagship high-speed option. Travelers often prepare by packing snacks, downloading their digital ticket via the DB Navigator app, and arriving at the station with some buffer time.

ICE trains glide smoothly into stations, promising a quiet and comfortable ride. From finding the right platform to settling into a reserved seat, the experience is both organized and traveler-friendly. But what makes a German train journey unique? Let’s explore that, one question at a time.

# Are German Trains Punctual?

**German punctuality** is well-known, but the rail network has faced challenges in maintaining that standard. In recent years, only about **62.5%** of ICE long-distance trains arrived on time. Still, slight delays—typically a few minutes—are often manageable and met with understanding. Travelers use this time to grab a coffee or a snack from station vendors.

Despite occasional setbacks, **German trains remain a reliable mode of transport**, especially when compared to global standards. Passengers adapt quickly to minor changes, and most journeys proceed smoothly once underway.

# How Do You Book and Board a Deutsche Bahn Train?

Booking tickets is straightforward. The Deutsche Bahn website and the DB Navigator app offer user-friendly interfaces for planning routes, selecting train classes, and reserving seats. Digital tickets come as QR codes, eliminating the need for paper.

On travel day, departure boards and bilingual signage help guide travelers to their platforms. Platform diagrams show where each train car will stop, making it easy to board efficiently. Letting passengers disembark before boarding is a standard courtesy.

# Is Your Seat Really Yours? (Reserved Seating Explained)

Seat reservations are highly recommended for longer journeys. Onboard digital displays indicate reserved seats and the journey segments for which they’re booked. If someone is mistakenly seated in a reserved spot, a polite request usually resolves the issue.

**Seat etiquette** is taken seriously. Unreserved seats are first-come, first-served, but passengers without reservations should remain flexible in case the seat is later claimed. Having a reserved seat adds comfort and predictability to the journey.

# What Ticket Do You Need? (German Train Ticketing)

Tickets are typically checked after departure by conductors equipped with mobile scanners. Digital tickets from the DB app are quickly validated via QR codes. Germany operates on an **honor system**—there are no ticket barriers—but riding without a ticket can result in hefty fines.

Travelers using a **BahnCard** for discounts must present it with their ticket. Regional trains also accept mobile and paper passes, making the system flexible and accessible to tourists and frequent travelers alike.

# Hungry on the Train? What Are the Dining Options?

ICE trains feature a **Bordbistro**, offering coffee, snacks, sandwiches, and sometimes hot meals. While prices may be higher than station options, the convenience makes it worthwhile.

Bringing your own food is common. Many travelers pack sandwiches, fruit, or pastries. One notable snack is the **boiled egg**—compact, protein-rich, and long-lasting, though not without its distinctive smell. The casual atmosphere of train dining contributes to a relaxed travel experience.

# Why Do Germans Bring Boiled Eggs and Beer on Trains?

Among common snacks, **boiled eggs and beer** stand out. Boiled eggs are portable, nutritious, and easy to prepare, making them a frequent choice despite their divisive odor. Beer, on the other hand, is legally and socially acceptable onboard, unlike in many other countries.

These practices reflect a laid-back approach to train travel, emphasizing comfort and personal preferences. While they may surprise new visitors, they are well-accepted and routine for local travelers.

# Can You Relax and Take Your Shoes Off? (Train Etiquette in Germany)

Taking off shoes is a debated but generally tolerated practice, provided feet stay on the floor and are odor-free. Putting feet on seats is discouraged and considered disrespectful.

**German train etiquette** emphasizes quiet, cleanliness, and shared space courtesy. Playing loud music, speaking loudly on the phone, or using extra seats for luggage are frowned upon. Quiet zones offer additional peace for those who prefer silence. Passengers are expected to be mindful and considerate, helping maintain a pleasant environment for all.",1,1746194659.0,FutureInGermany,0,1.0,False

Bringing your own food is common. Many travelers pack sandwiches, fruit, or pastries. One notable snack is the **boiled egg**—compact, protein-rich, and long-lasting, though not without its distinctive smell. The casual atmosphere of train dining contributes to a relaxed travel experience.

# Why Do Germans Bring Boiled Eggs and Beer on Trains?

Among common snacks, **boiled eggs and beer** stand out. Boiled eggs are portable, nutritious, and easy to prepare, making them a frequent choice despite their divisive odor. Beer, on the other hand, is legally and socially acceptable onboard, unlike in many other countries.

These practices reflect a laid-back approach to train travel, emphasizing comfort and personal preferences. While they may surprise new visitors, they are well-accepted and routine for local travelers.

# Can You Relax and Take Your Shoes Off? (Train Etiquette in Germany)

Taking off shoes is a debated but generally tolerated practice, provided feet stay on the floor and are odor-free. Putting feet on seats is discouraged and considered disrespectful.

**German train etiquette** emphasizes quiet, cleanliness, and shared space courtesy. Playing loud music, speaking loudly on the phone, or using extra seats for luggage are frowned upon. Quiet zones offer additional peace for those who prefer silence. Passengers are expected to be mindful and considerate, helping maintain a pleasant environment for all.",1,1746194641.0,GermanyStudentLife,0,1.0,False

1kd1nja,https://youtu.be/LiJm6IihNVc,4 Very Scary TRUE Camping Bone-Chilling Moments Horror Stories,"""**The Watcher on Mt. Stringer**"":

It was a beautiful summer evening in North Carolina, the kind where the golden light lingers just a little longer and the air is warm but soft with the promise of cooler mountain air. I was leading a group of eight middle school kids on a week-long camping trip as part of an outdoor adventure program. Our destination that night was the summit of Mt. Stringer, a quiet, lesser-known peak nestled deep in the western part of the state. The hike had taken most of the afternoon—steep inclines, uneven switchbacks, and rocky outcroppings that challenged even the more athletic kids—but they were tougher than they looked. They grumbled, sure, but they didn’t quit. I was proud of them for that.

We reached the top just as the sun was dipping below the ridgeline, casting everything in deep orange and pink hues. The sky seemed to burn, the clouds streaked with crimson light, and the view stretched for miles—layers upon layers of forested hills rolling away into the haze, like a vast green ocean frozen in time. There was no cell service up here, no hum of cars or power lines, just the whispering wind and the excited chatter of kids who had earned their view. It felt like we were standing on the edge of the world.

We set up camp in a clearing just below the summit, ringed by firs and thick underbrush. There were five tents in all—two for the boys, two for the girls, and one for me and my co-instructor, Sarah. She and I had worked together on a few trips before, and she was calm, dependable, and had a great way with the kids. After pitching the tents and settling in, we built a small fire in a stone ring left by other hikers. Dinner was simple: fire-roasted hot dogs, followed by the inevitable, gooey mess of s’mores. The kids were loud, telling stories and laughing, mouths sticky with marshmallow and chocolate, but that kind of joy is contagious, and we didn’t mind.

As darkness fell, the forest grew quiet again. One by one, the kids yawned and drifted off to their tents. Sarah and I made the rounds, checking zippers, handing out extra socks, making sure everyone had water nearby. By the time the camp was silent, it was close to 10 p.m. Sarah said she was heading to bed, and I told her I’d stay up a little longer. I wasn’t quite ready to let go of the peace yet.

The sky was unbelievably clear, the stars like pinpricks punched through black velvet. A full moon hung over the mountains, glowing bright enough to cast shadows. It was almost like daytime, but quieter, more still. I slung my hammock between two trees a little ways off from the tents, close enough to hear if anyone needed me, but far enough that I could enjoy a bit of solitude. I pulled out my flashlight and my paperback thriller, something about a detective tracking a killer through the woods—maybe not the best choice, in hindsight.

The hammock swayed gently as I read, cocooned in the sounds of the night—crickets, owls, the distant cry of a fox. The scent of pine needles and faint smoke lingered in the air. It was peaceful in a way that made the rest of the world feel distant and unreal. I stayed like that for over an hour, flipping pages, until my eyes started getting heavy.

Around 10:30 p.m., I switched off my headlamp and nestled deeper into the hammock, letting the moonlight wash over me. I had just closed my eyes when something on the trail below caught my attention. Movement. A figure.

At first, I assumed it was an animal—maybe a deer or a bear. Black bears are common in this area, and I mentally rehearsed what I’d do if one wandered too close. I sat up slowly, watching carefully. But the way it moved wasn’t right for an animal. It was too upright. Too slow and deliberate.

As it came closer, I realized it was a man. Alone. Walking up the steep trail in the dark. He wasn’t carrying a flashlight or wearing reflective gear—just a dark silhouette slowly ascending the last incline toward the summit. The moonlight glinted faintly off his shoulders, revealing that he had no backpack, no visible supplies. Just clothes and boots, like someone out for a stroll. But this wasn’t a place you casually strolled to—not at this hour, not without gear.

I stayed perfectly still, barely breathing, as he reached the top and came to a stop. He stood motionless, looking in our direction. From my spot in the hammock, tucked in shadow, I had a clear view of the clearing and the tents. He had one too.

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just stood there.

Every instinct in me tensed. The forest, so welcoming moments ago, suddenly felt vast and vulnerable. I strained my eyes to make out more, but the details were lost in the dark. He was just a dark shape against silver moonlight, but I could feel his attention fixed on us, like a weight pressing against my chest.

After several minutes, he turned and walked slowly to a large pine tree near the edge of our clearing and sat down, his back against the trunk, legs stretched out in front of him. He was still facing the tents.

I felt a rising dread that I couldn’t shake. I knew this wasn’t normal. Hikers don’t appear out of nowhere in the middle of the night, climb to remote summits without gear, and sit watching a group of sleeping kids. My first thought was to wake Sarah, but I hesitated. If I left, he might get closer. Or worse, do something before I could get back. I didn’t want to spook him—or make a mistake I couldn’t take back. So I waited.

The minutes crawled by like hours. The air turned colder. I pulled my sleeping bag tighter around me, but it wasn’t the cold that made me shiver. He didn’t move. Didn’t sleep. Just sat there like some ancient statue, staring in silence. My mind started spiraling with possibilities. Was he lost? On drugs? Mentally ill? Or was it something darker?

At one point I gripped the handle of my tiny pocket knife and realized how utterly useless it felt. I imagined confronting him, imagined him standing up, imagined what he might say—or do. None of the outcomes were good. My heart thudded in my chest for hours, every leaf rustle sending a jolt through me.

Then, just after 3:00 a.m., he stirred. Slowly, like something waking from a long sleep, he stood and stretched his arms wide, his silhouette stark against the pale glow. For a second, he looked straight toward me—or maybe just the tents behind me—and took two slow steps in our direction.

I froze.

But then, without a word or sound, he turned and walked away, back down the trail the same way he had come. His form gradually melted into the trees, swallowed by the darkness. I didn’t hear a single footstep.

Even then, I didn’t sleep. Not a wink. I lay there, wide-eyed, scanning the edge of the forest until the sky began to lighten. When the sun finally rose, I felt like I had survived something I couldn’t name.

When Sarah emerged from her tent, stretching and yawning, I told her everything. Her face changed in an instant, concern hardening into something like anger. “You should have woken me,” she said.

“I didn’t want to panic you,” I told her, my voice rough. “I wasn’t sure what it was.”

“We can’t take chances like that,” she said. “Not with the kids.”

She was right. We agreed right there to take shifts the next night, just in case. We didn’t tell the kids—there was no need to scare them unless something actually happened—but I could tell I wasn’t the only one feeling off. The kids were more subdued that morning, as if the mountain itself had whispered something unsettling into their dreams.

On our last morning, as we broke camp, one of the boys came up to me holding something in his hand. “Hey, look what I found,” he said, grinning.

It was a small wooden carving, about five inches tall, shaped like a faceless person—no eyes, no mouth, no features at all. Just a blank head on a crude, human-shaped body. The surface was rough, like it had been carved with a knife, maybe even recently.

“Where did you get this?” I asked.

“Over by that tree,” he said, pointing—to the same tree where the man had sat.

A cold pulse of fear went through me, like ice trickling down my spine. I turned the figure over in my hand. It felt heavy despite its size. Primitive. Wrong, somehow.

I told the boy it was probably just something another camper had left behind, thanked him, and tucked it into my pack without saying anything more. But the unease lingered. As we hiked back down the mountain, I found myself checking behind us more than once, convinced I might catch a glimpse of that same dark figure watching from the trees.

We made it home without incident. But even now, years later, I still have that carved figure tucked in a box at the back of a drawer. I’ve thought about throwing it away, but something stops me every time. Maybe I want the reminder. Or maybe, deep down, I’m still trying to understand what happened that night—what I saw, who he was, and what his presence meant. I don’t think I’ll ever have those answers. But I’ll never forget that feeling, either.



The feeling of being watched in the middle of the wilderness, and knowing—without a doubt—that whoever was out there didn’t come in peace.







""**Into the Pines: A Night of Fire and Fear in Manistee**"":

It was early June, the air just starting to warm and the trees thick with new green. My friends and I had been planning a getaway for weeks—something off the grid, something that would let us disconnect from the noise of city life. The destination we chose was Manistee National Forest in northern Michigan, a stretch of rugged wilderness with rivers, deep woods, and plenty of isolation. We were chasing solitude—just us, the river, and miles of untouched forest. We wanted to fish, kayak, and sit around a fire without the sound of car engines or cell phones breaking the silence.

There were four of us: me, my longtime friend Tom, his girlfriend Sarah, and our buddy Mike. Tom had a reliable old F-150 that we loaded with all our gear—tents, sleeping bags, cooking supplies, portable coolers packed with food and drinks, and our kayaks strapped tightly on top. We brought extra propane tanks, water jugs, and even a small solar-powered lantern in case our flashlights gave out. We'd done trips like this before, but this time felt different. We were heading farther out, relying on offline maps and our instincts to guide us to a spot few people knew about.

The drive from Chicago took about six hours, winding north through farmland that slowly gave way to denser woods. Cell reception grew spottier the farther we went, and that was exactly what we wanted. As we crossed into the national forest, the paved roads turned to gravel and then to dirt, narrow and rutted, the forest pressing in close on both sides. We had to drive slowly, dodging branches and potholes, but eventually we came to a clearing near the river that looked like something out of a dream.

Tom pulled the truck into a small flat area shaded by tall pines. The river glimmered just beyond the tree line, wide and slow-moving, its surface broken occasionally by fish jumping or a breeze rustling across it. The air was thick with the smell of pine needles and fresh water. The ground was soft but not soggy, ideal for pitching tents. A blackened ring of rocks near the river indicated a fire pit used by campers before us.

“This is perfect,” Tom said as he cut the engine. He opened his door and stepped out, stretching. “Look at that view.”

We all stood there for a moment, taking it in—the ripple of water against the banks, the sound of wind through the trees, and the distant trill of birds calling across the canopy. It felt untouched, sacred even. No other cars, no trailheads, no signs. Just forest and river.

We unloaded the truck, making a small base camp with the two tents spaced out for a bit of privacy. Mike and I worked quickly to get the tents up while Tom and Sarah gathered dry wood from nearby. I could hear them laughing as they broke off dead branches and carried armloads back. By the time we had the tents staked and our gear organized, the sun was sinking low, turning the sky a soft orange and casting long shadows across the forest floor.

We built a fire and cooked dinner—thick steaks grilled over open flame, foil-wrapped potatoes roasted in the coals, and corn on the cob that we basted with butter. We passed around beers and paper plates, eating hungrily after the long drive and all the setup. The meal tasted better than anything you’d find in a restaurant, made richer by the setting and the shared effort.

As night settled over the forest, the fire crackled louder in the stillness. One by one, the stars blinked into view, until the sky was flooded with them. Without city lights to wash them out, we could see the Milky Way stretching from horizon to horizon, a hazy ribbon of stars like smoke drifting through the sky. Sarah lay back on a blanket, her head resting on Tom’s chest. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many stars,” she whispered.

We lay there for over an hour, pointing out constellations, debating whether one streak of light was a shooting star or a satellite. The sounds of the forest at night—crickets, frogs, the occasional rustle of something small in the underbrush—felt comforting. Everything was peaceful. No one had looked at their phones in hours.

Eventually, the fire began to die down. We doused it carefully with water, stirring the ashes until we were certain no embers remained. Tom and Sarah zipped into one tent, Mike and I into the other. I lay on my back in the sleeping bag, tired and content. The ground was cool beneath the tent floor, but not uncomfortable. I could hear the river flowing softly in the distance and the last few pops of firewood settling.

At some point in the night, I woke up. No dream, no movement—just a strange feeling that something was… off. The air felt heavy, still. I blinked in the darkness, unsure what had roused me, until I heard it—a low, rhythmic sound, faint but distinct. Chanting. It was distant, almost carried on the wind, but the tone was unmistakable. It was human, ritualistic, and getting louder.

I sat up and strained to listen. The pattern was deliberate, voices rising and falling in unison. Then I noticed a faint orange glow filtering through the tent fabric. My stomach clenched. I crawled over to the zipper and eased it open just enough to look out.

Across the river, maybe 300 yards away, a large wooden cross burned with intense flames. The fire climbed high, sparks drifting upward into the dark. Figures moved around it—shadowy, indistinct—but unmistakably human. The chanting continued, louder now, joined by the occasional hoot or shout. My mind tried to rationalize what I was seeing, but there was no mistaking it. A burning cross. A rally. The Ku Klux Klan.

“Mike,” I hissed, shaking him. “Mike, wake up.”

He groaned, disoriented. “What’s going on?”

“Get up. Look outside.”

He leaned over and peered through the flap. His breath caught. “Is that a cross?” he whispered.

“Yeah. A big one. And there’s people around it. They’re chanting.”

Then came the sound that made my blood run cold—gunshots. Not a single shot, but several, in quick succession. It echoed across the water, sharp and violent. We both ducked instinctively, hearts racing.

“They’re shooting,” Mike said, his voice tight with fear. “What the hell is happening?”

“We need to get out of here.” I scrambled out of the tent and jogged to Tom and Sarah’s. I shook the tent and whispered urgently, “Tom, Sarah—wake up. Now. Something’s going on across the river.”

Tom’s groggy face appeared. “What’s the matter?”

“There’s a cross burning. People chanting. They’re shooting guns.”

Sarah sat up beside him. “Are you serious?”

“Dead serious. We have to go. Now.”

We didn’t take time to pack. Just grabbed the essentials—wallets, phones, keys. We left the tents, the cooler, even the kayaks behind. The four of us moved quickly but quietly through the dark, every crack of a twig underfoot feeling like a gunshot. The chanting and gunfire continued across the water, muffled slightly by the trees but still terrifying.

Tom got the truck started on the first try, and we pulled out onto the dirt road, headlights carving a narrow path through the woods. Nobody spoke for a while. I kept checking the rearview mirror, expecting headlights or something worse to appear behind us. But nothing did.

An hour later, we reached a small town with a gas station and a 24-hour diner. We parked and went inside, still dazed. The fluorescent lights and clatter of dishes felt surreal after what we’d just experienced. We ordered coffee and sat in silence for a few minutes before anyone spoke.

“I can’t believe we stumbled onto a Klan rally,” Sarah finally said, staring into her mug.

“I thought that kind of thing was ancient history,” I said. “Like… something from the '60s. Not in the middle of the forest in Michigan.”

Mike shook his head slowly. “Apparently it’s not. And we were way too close for comfort.”

Tom exhaled hard. “If they’d known we were there…”

We all knew what he meant. There was no need to finish the sentence.

After calming down and finishing our coffee, we found a small motel and booked two rooms for the night. None of us slept well. I kept waking up, heart racing, replaying the sounds of that night—those voices, the fire, the gunshots.

The next morning, under gray skies and with a sense of dread, we drove back to retrieve our gear. We approached cautiously, half-expecting to find damage, or worse. But the area across the river was deserted. No cross, no figures, no sound. Just trees and the flowing river. It was as if the night before had never happened.

Our camp was untouched. Tents still pitched, coolers unopened. We packed everything quickly and left, glancing over our shoulders more than once.



Even now, I think about that night sometimes. The way something so peaceful can flip into something so dangerous, so quickly. It was a sobering reminder that the wilderness isn’t just home to bears and coyotes. Sometimes the real threats are human, and they’re much harder to predict. That night in Manistee changed the way I think about the woods. I still camp, still love the outdoors, but I always stay more alert. Because no matter how remote or serene a place may seem, you never really know what—or who—is out there.







**""The Boy in the Dark"":**

It happened back in 2004, when I was camping with my buddy Jake in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas. We were just looking for a quiet weekend away from everything—no cell phones, no traffic, no obligations. Just us, a couple of sleeping bags, and the kind of silence you don’t realize you’ve missed until you’re out in the middle of it. But what we ended up with was something else entirely—an experience that would leave a deep mark on both of us. No ghosts, no monsters. Just something real, something human. And somehow, that made it scarier. I’ll tell it like it happened, every moment, every sound, every sick twist in my gut, so you can feel it like I did.

The Ozarks were everything we hoped for—rolling hills blanketed with oaks and hickories, hidden waterfalls, and that thick, green quiet that settles around you once you’re miles from the nearest road. We found a spot off an old forest service trail near a little stream, a clearing not more than twenty feet across, just enough space for the tent, a fire ring someone had built with river stones, and a couple of fallen logs we used as benches. There were no other campers anywhere nearby—at least none that we saw. The nearest ranger station was almost an hour’s drive back down the winding gravel road, and we hadn’t seen another car since we'd turned off the highway.

The day was perfect. We hiked, fished a little, and mostly just talked—reminisced about college, caught up on life, drank cheap beer. Jake had just gone through a rough breakup and needed the headspace. I just needed the quiet. By the time the sun dipped below the ridge and the trees turned black against the orange sky, we were sitting around a crackling fire, eating charred hot dogs off sharpened sticks and letting the cool night settle in. The stars overhead were so bright it felt like they might fall right out of the sky. I remember leaning back and saying, “You ever think about just… not going back?”

Jake chuckled. “Yeah. All the time.”

We talked like that for a while—philosophical, maybe a little buzzed. By ten, we’d zipped ourselves into the tent. I could still hear the stream gurgling nearby, the low drone of crickets, and the occasional rustle of wind through the trees. Everything felt right. Secure. I fell asleep fast, like a rock.

But sometime after 2 a.m., I shot awake. Not groggy, not drifting—just *awake*, heart pounding like a drumline in my chest. I didn’t know why at first. The tent was still, the forest outside was quiet. Then I heard it—this soft sound, like a tiny whimper. At first, I thought maybe I was dreaming, but then came another sound: a faint, rhythmic patting noise. Like fingers slapping gently against the nylon of the tent.

I held my breath.

The sound came again, and this time I was sure it wasn’t an animal. Raccoons don’t whimper like that. My gut twisted, and I sat up slowly, straining to listen.

“Jake,” I whispered, nudging his shoulder. “Jake. Wake up.”

He stirred, groaning. “What is it?” he mumbled, eyes still closed.

“Shh,” I hissed. “There’s something outside. Listen.”

He blinked and went still, his ears tuning in. Then he heard it too. The soft whimper. The patting. His expression changed immediately—no more sleep in his eyes. Just alert, tense awareness.

“What the hell is that?” he whispered.

“I don’t know,” I said. My voice felt thin and dry.

The patting stopped. But the whimpering didn’t. It changed—grew louder. Sadder. More… human.

“Is that… a kid?” Jake said, half-whispered.

“That’s what it sounds like,” I said, feeling ice crawl up my spine.

Jake shook his head. “That doesn’t make sense. Out here? In the middle of the goddamn forest?”

We were both frozen. Something about it didn’t sit right—not just the sound, but the *wrongness* of it. It was like hearing a child’s laughter in an abandoned house. Too innocent for the setting. Too misplaced.

I reached for the flashlight beside my sleeping bag and, with trembling fingers, slowly unzipped the front flap of the tent, just enough to poke the light through.

And there he was.

A tiny boy, maybe three years old, standing barefoot in the cold dirt. He was wearing nothing but a drooping diaper, streaked with mud. His face was pale, cheeks blotchy from crying. His lips trembled. He didn’t say a word, just looked at me with wide, glassy eyes, his little hands stretching toward the tent fabric again.

“Jesus Christ,” I breathed. “It *is* a kid.”

Jake leaned closer to the flap and saw him too. “What the *hell*…”

I slowly unzipped the flap all the way and stepped out, the cold biting at my skin through my long johns. The air smelled damp, earthy. The kind of chill that seeps into your bones. But all I could think about was the boy.

“Hey, buddy,” I said softly, crouching down a few feet away. “It’s okay. You’re okay. Where’s your mommy, huh?”

He didn’t answer. Just sobbed louder and waddled toward me with a clumsy, desperate gait. I felt this sudden mix of panic and protectiveness. I wanted to pick him up, shield him from the cold—but something held me back. Because how the hell did a three-year-old end up alone, in a forest like this, in the middle of the night?

“Jake,” I said over my shoulder, “grab my phone. We need to call someone. Now.”

He scrambled inside and came out seconds later, squinting at the screen. “I’ve got one bar. Maybe.”

He dialed and paced, voice tight and shaky. “Yeah, hi—uh, we’re camping in the Ozarks, near… I think near Devil’s Den. There’s a little kid here, toddler age, maybe three. No clothes, just a diaper. We don’t know where he came from.”

I heard the dispatcher’s voice through the phone—calm but urgent.

I called out, “He’s not hurt. Just crying. Scared. Cold.”

Jake relayed it. The dispatcher told us to stay put, keep the boy warm, and not to move.

I ran into the tent and pulled out a blanket, wrapping it around the kid’s tiny shoulders. He was ice cold to the touch. His skin felt damp. He leaned into me, still crying, but a little quieter now.

Then Jake said something that turned my stomach.

“What if his parents aren’t out here?” he whispered. “What if this is… something else?”

I looked at him, eyes wide. “What do you mean?”

“I mean… what if someone *left* him here?”

The silence that followed was thicker than the night. The woods around us, once peaceful, now felt suffocating. Every snapping twig, every shift of the wind, sounded like someone creeping closer. I scanned the trees with my flashlight, feeling that invisible weight of being watched.

Then, from the darkness, a voice—female, panicked, calling out.

“*Tommy!* Tommy, where are you!?”

A flashlight beam bobbed through the trees. The voice got closer, frantic and raw with terror.

Jake and I both froze. I didn’t know whether to feel relief or more fear.

“Here!” I called out, standing up with the boy in my arms. “He’s here!”

A woman broke through the underbrush seconds later, breathless, face pale and smeared with tears. She was wearing pajama pants, a hoodie, and no shoes. Her flashlight shook in her hand as she saw us. When she spotted the child, she let out a sob and rushed forward, pulling him out of my arms.

“Oh my God. Tommy. Oh my God, baby, I’m so sorry.” She rocked him back and forth, whispering into his hair.

Jake and I stood back, still tense. Something about it didn’t fully add up. She hadn’t called his name more than once. No mention of a campsite. No flashlight until the last second.

“We called the cops,” I said, keeping my voice neutral. “They’re on the way.”

“That’s okay,” she said, brushing tears away. “We’re just over the ridge. I must’ve left the tent unzipped. I woke up and he was gone.”

Jake shot me a look behind her back. I knew what he was thinking, because I was thinking it too: this didn’t feel right.

A few minutes later, we heard a vehicle crunching along the dirt road nearby. Two deputies showed up with floodlights and radios. They asked for IDs, talked to the woman, looked over the kid. She gave a name, a nearby trailhead, said her boyfriend was asleep when she realized the boy was missing.

After a few minutes of quiet questions and side-eyes, the officers seemed satisfied. “Just keep a better eye on him, ma’am,” one said. “These woods aren’t kind to wanderers.”

She thanked us again, and they escorted her back into the trees.

We got back into our tent, but neither of us even pretended to sleep. We sat up, backs against the nylon wall, flashlight between us, listening.

“That could’ve gone… very differently,” Jake said.

“Yeah,” I said. “It still might’ve.”

The next morning, we saw her across the ridge, breaking down her camp. She waved at us like nothing happened. Just a tired smile, like it had all been some unfortunate mishap. We waved back, but didn’t speak.

I'm a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, and I'm looking for female friends who would like to chat and maybe even become good friends.

I'm really into art! Whenever I have free time, I love drawing and painting. I enjoy visiting art galleries, going to the theater, and watching movies. I once volunteered at a theater, which made me fall in love with acting and performance arts. Besides that, I love watching all kinds of movies and series, especially about history, politics, and nature, but I also enjoy something fun and lighthearted. Right now, I’m really into the series *Cunk on Earth*.

I love reading books, from classics to psychology. My favorite literature is Lithuanian, and my favorite book is *Tūla*.

Music is also a big part of my life. I listen to all kinds of genres, from classical and jazz to electronic music. Some of my favorite artists are Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Kamanių Šilelis, Alina Orlova, The Be Good Tanyas, and many more.

I’m always curious and love learning new things, so I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, and psychology.

I also love going on walks, whether it's strolling through the old town, walking in parks, or by the river. In summer, I enjoy cycling, wandering through fields and meadows, swimming in lakes, and watching the sunrise and sunset.

Oh, and I’m a huge coffee fan, it’s basically my hobby!

I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

1kd1mei,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kd1mei/teen_girl_is_obsessed_with_me_against_my_wish/,Teen girl is obsessed with me (against my wish),"Pretty much what the title sounds like.

I am 22M. I finished college last year and towards the end of the final semester, I met a fresher girl in my dept and we performed a duet song during a departmental event.

I had bought her coffee on the first day we practiced and just talked to her nicely because I thought that would be a nice gesture as a senior.

But she started waiting for me as days went by, even after the event got over. She would wait outside my classroom and keep asking everyone about me until I came outside.

Weeks passed by and it only got more and more intense. She is younger (around 18 i think) so it was awkward for me, plus I have a gf. I tried shoving her off, being rude to her, blocking her, ignoring her, calmy confronting her, etc. But she finds one way or another to jump right back in.

Eventually, people started teasing me about her and associating us together. My real gf was still long distance at this point and I was really touch deprived.

Somewhere along the way, I might've started to like the physical proximity that she was making me feel. So it started to become harder for me.

Now, things happened in between, and I am now with my girlfriend in another city but she keeps randomly trying to reach me through various numbers no matter how many I block them. Once my gf was using my phone and her SMS literally popped up on the screen.

To give you an idea of how obsessed she is, she literally told me once that she was fine being a side chick to me since I would never become her's?

I don't know how to deal with this. I have never had this happen. I had never gotten much attention from girls before college so I struggle with being assertive when a girl flirts around me.

And I am moving back there next week, really neevous that I might stumble upon her again and repeat the cycle all over again. It's actually even more messed up that this but that would make a really long post so I've stripped the complications.

What would you do if you were me? Also, have you ever seen this happen to anyone, or to yourself even?",0,1746194301.0,self,4,0.5,False

A month went by and we were very happy and then we started to notice some variation in the coffee with flavor. Tried adjusting the temperature and coarseness. without much difference. our conclusion was the beans were perhaps not of consistent quality. After a while I was about to move the machine I saw that water/coffee had come out from under it. And at the same time I started to notice that the puck that is in the drawer has to be scooped out with a spoon or your fingers, just mushy and sticky.  I contacted De'Longhi and got some instructions on what to look for and try out some settings. I decided to clean the machine thoroughly with descaling agent.and everything.When I got to the brewing unit, it was sticky with black coffee all over the unit. cleaned according to manual. saw with mirrors all around inside Oh, there was coffee spilled all around. Tried another round of descaling.the coffee drawer there was a lot of water and behind it.Contacted De'Longhi with information and pictures, and said I had to send it in for service. went to dealer They agreed that it shouldn't be like that.

What should we do? is this normal we are wondering if we should just throw it away and go back to instant coffee instead 

There's a lot of frustration around this now when you feel like you're spending extra money to get a better machine and it turns out to be almost worse than the cheaper alternatives.

1kd1joq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kd1joq/aio_my_husbands_female_friend_cropped_a_group/,AIO - My husband's female friend cropped a group photo and used it as her profile pic,"This is my 1st reddit post, my writing skills are poor, and this is a long story, so I apologize in advance if I cause any confusion or annoyance.


My (40F) husband (40M) has a female friend (40F) we all knew since middle school.  We went to the same tiny school and were in the same grade.  My husband (I'll call him Jason) and I knew each other since 9 years old, started dating at 14 years old, went to the same college, moved back to our home town, and eventually got married. No kids with no plans to have them. Jason's female friend (I'll call her Ann) went to a different college, but she moved back to our home town after college as well to be with her parents. 


Even though all three of us knew each other since middle school, Ann only became close with Jason and not with me. Jason and Ann were friendly  (not yet friends) in middle & high school, but Ann made the effort to reconnect with Jason when we all returned to our hometown after college. I wasn't suspicious of her intentions then because Jason and Ann have similar personalities; friendly, open, sociable.  I'm quite the opposite; I'm shy, introverted, a bit of a loner, and I have mild social anxiety around groups of more than 5 people.  People prefer to gravitate toward Jason rather than me and I actually prefer it that way. Jason cares about people, loves to socialize, and is very good at keeping friends by sending the occasional ""hey, how have you been doing?"". He likes to go with the flow in social situations and tries to be neutral/non-judgmental to a fault; great for giving advice, but not so great at taking sides or giving strong opinions. 


I only started to become annoyed with Ann after years of little things which culminated into the infamous WhatsApp profile pic.  I feel like I have to talk about her background history which I'm not sure if all of it is relevant, but I think it helps to paint a fuller picture. Ann struggles with loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem, and she has a string of failed relationships with men. All of this she has confided in Jason and Jason would tell me. If you're wondering, Jason has warned Ann that he literally tells me everything, but we're pretty sure she eventually forgot because the things he's told me are quite shocking (to me at least). During college, we heard from a mutual friend that Ann went missing for a few weeks.  Turns out, she ran away from college and holed up in a motel where she was eventually tracked down and retrieved by her brother.  Jason never asked why because he has a feeling it's a touchy subject. Ann did another disappearing act 5 years ago during COVID where she essentially ghosted Jason. All of sudden she wasn't responding to texts and calls would go to voicemail. He eventually called her house out of fear that she died or was seriously injured and her mom answered the phone. He asked if Ann was alright, she replied yes, but was acting dodgy. At that point, Jason got the hint that Ann was deliberately avoiding him.  He was still concerned and a little sad because her disappearing act came from nowhere.  But he quickly got over it and life moved on. 2 years later, Ann physically shows up out of the blue at Jason's workplace like nothing happened. Her only explanation was that she was depressed and needed time to herself. When questioned why she couldn't have just texted that so he wouldn't think she was dead in a ditch somewhere, she apologized and didn't offer any other details.  Jason being Jason didn't push and they continued with their friendship like being ghosted for 2 years was a small blip. I was outraged for Jason and I thought ""what kind of friend does this?"", but I let it be.


About her romantic relationships- she has been ""the other woman"" with 2 different men. Not at the same time. The 1st one was with a married man.  The 2nd one was with her coworker who had a girlfriend. Ann only seemed concerned that the married man had a kid and how the kid would be affected. With the coworker, she wasn't all that concerned about his relationship status because he promised Ann he wasn't in love with his girlfriend anymore and that he would break up with her soon. Those 2 relationships didn't work out for obvious reasons. Besides that, there was one time she called Jason to pick her up at 3am because she was stranded at her booty call's apartment. With most of her relationships she would proudly tell them about Jason, how he's her best friend, how important he is to her, and if Jason expressed any disapproval she would take his opinion very seriously. For at least one of her relationships, she has said to them that if it came down to a choice she would choose Jason.  All these incidences irked me, but not enough to be angry or concerned or bring anything up mostly because Jason is always so effortlessly transparent with me. I never asked him to do this, but he even keeps a messaging app open on his giant computer monitor and he doesn't mind if I occasionally glance over and read his messages. It's more convenient for him to see a message in the corner of his computer screen rather than having to pick up his phone.


My annoyance really started to ratchet up recently when the due date for our move across the country started getting closer. So last year when he started to remind everyone he's preparing for the move, Ann increased her visits to his workplace to almost daily. Jason's the manager so there's no one to tell him off for it. She's visited so often, his employees all thought Jason was cheating on me with her. I've also seen her message Jason every now and then how she hates that he's leaving, with no context at all. They're just chatting about something not related to the move, and then she'll say, ""I hate that you're leaving"" out of the blue. The final straw was the WhatsApp pic.


Ann has a bad habit of flirting back with guys she's not interested in and she gives them her number when asked because she doesn't know how to say no. So instead of saying no, she asked Jason if she can use a pic she cropped from a group photo. She cropped it where it just shows a headshot of their faces together. She had it as her WhatsApp profile pic for a month or two, and then she changed it to a selfie. And then a few months ago she changed it back to the cropped couples photo. I asked Jason if Ann was still getting hounded by her admirers and he said, not that he knew of. All I could think of every time I saw that pic was, ""that's my frikkin husband you b"", and how embarrassing it looked. I could only assume that all the people in her contact list would think how weird and suspicious Ann's profile pic is of her and a married man and they probably felt pity for me that my husband had such a suspicious relationship with his ""friend"". It also made Ann look desperate for a man that's not hers. 

It all came to a head when Jason and I got back from travelling a few weeks ago. Jason continued his travels to visit his cousin while I went back home. I asked Jason if he could ask Ann to pick me up from the airport and drop me back home because I knew she's the least likeliest to say no. I've never had her as a contact before and I would obviously need to add her to let her know the plane landed. So I asked Jason how likely is it that she would change her profile pic when it was time for her to pick me up? He didn't believe she would. I've talked with him exhaustively over this to try to understand his point of view, but he genuinely believes that the people who know they are just friends won't think anything of it, and the people who don't know they're friends don't matter. So basically he didnt see anything wrong with the pic and he thought Ann was on the same wavelength. 


Anyway, I was right. The day she was supposed to pick me up from the airport, she changed her profile pic to a generic landscape photo. We did small talk on the ride to my house, but on the inside I was excited about how I was right. Only when I got home and unpacked did that excitement slowly turn into rage. To me, this proved that Ann knew that photo was wrong. Why else would she hide it from me? I definitely rubbed it in Jason's face as soon as he had wifi. Jason admitted he was very surprised and concerned about Ann's intentions. From there, I went over all the things Ann has said and done that raised red flags for me. I told him as soon as he gets back, he needs to talk to Ann. I also told him my fears of being brushed off or having to argue with him over telling him to talk with Ann, but he reassured me that I'm his wife, he loves me, and he takes all my concerns seriously, and he'll definitely have a talk with Ann about all my concerns. And he apologized for being dumb. Jason is very clueless about social etiquette/rules/boundaries and I've know that about him since we were 12. He has to be told point blank when something is weird, so I wasn't too upset with him. 


I also had an epiphany regarding how Ann acts around me compared to how she acts around other people. She's friendly and polite with me, but I noticed she has never actually tried to get to know me. It's never more than small talk. Usually it's awkward silence when Jason has to go to the bathroom. When Ann, Jason, and I are all together in the same room, her conversations are with Jason. I used to work at a clinic, so when she had health related questions, she would ask Jason when I'm not there to ask me for her. She doesn't ask me those questions when we're physically in the same space. I've known this girl for over 30 years and she needs to go through Jason to indirectly ask me a question? In contrast, she's gotten really close with Jason's employees. During her near daily visits to his workplace, she took the time to get to know them. She added them to her WhatsApp contacts so they definitely saw that photo. She has gotten so close with them that she even visits them at work when Jason is at home. 


Ann knows she has been overly dependent on Jason for her mental health and that she needs therapy. She also predicts she's going to spiral into a depression when he leaves. She did see a therapist for 2 or 3 sessions, but she admitted to cancelling her follow up appointments. She changes the subject when asked why. 


So next week, Jason set up a coffee date with Ann to talk about almost everything I just wrote (leaving out her relationship history) and how she's been violating my boundaries and she needs to continue with her therapy sessions. I gave permission that they can still contact each other with the reminder that I will know everything. She'll need to understand that she's walking on eggshells with me and I never want to see her face again. 


The problem is that I feel a little guilty that this will more than likely break a friendship. Ann will realize that Jason has told me everything she has confided  in him so she will feel embarrassed, if not betrayed. I also feel a bit guilty that I'll be responsible for accelerating her depression. Also, a big part of my guilt is that I've known Ann for years and this will seem like it came from nowhere. Maybe I should've said something awhile ago, but I was afraid of being a paranoid controlling wife. On the other hand, Ann proved she knew the Whatsapp pic was wrong when she hid it from me. Did she also know all of her other actions were wrong? 


So, AIO about that WhatsApp pic?  Was Ann overstepping relationship boundaries with all the other things I mentioned? There's the telling her boyfriends how Jason is more important than them, there's the near daily visits, the random and multiple ""I hate that you're leaving"" messages, and getting super close with Jason's employees while she can't even directly ask me for advice related to my occupation. Should I just let this go since Jason and I are leaving in 3 months anyway? Thanks guys for your help. Sorry again for the long, rambly rant. ",1,1746194093.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.67,False

I’m planning to move to DC the weekend after Labor Day (Sept 7–8) and would love any advice, neighborhood recs, or general thoughts from folks here who’ve done something similar! For perspective, I’ve never lived/moved solo and this whole process is new to me. 

I’m a 29-year-old woman, born and raised in Brooklyn. I’m graduating from grad school in 3 weeks & turning 30 the same week, so it feels like the right time to finally make this move. I went to college in Greensboro, NC and have a bunch of friends in the DMV — I’ve been visiting for years and always felt drawn to living here. Also, I’ve been living at home the last 8 years since I finished undergrad as I was gig hopping and working in food service. especially drawn to Mount Pleasant, Columbia Heights, Petworth, and Adams Morgan (north of the chaos) — they seem to have the right mix of calm, charm, walkability, and community. I’d love something that gives Park Slope/Carroll Gardens (the neighborhood I grew up in, even though it’s a bit bougie/$$$ now) energy — farmers markets, co-op groceries, leafy streets, local coffee shops.

I’m also a runner, so I’m really hoping to live near a park or trail system like Rock Creek, Anacostia River Trail, or Mount Vernon Trail — anywhere I can get in long runs without dodging tourists or waiting at every stoplight.

Hoping to find a studio or 1BR under ~$1,800, and I’m planning to tour apartments in late July or early August (again, I’ve never moved!) I’m aiming for a Sept 1 lease but to move the following weekend (avoiding Labor Day traffic, ideally having a friend drive me down in their truck).

If anyone has tips on where to look, what to know about moving here, fostering cats, or avoiding rookie mistakes, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!

I realized what I enjoy about shooting is not the shooting itself - it's the fun with friends at the range. The community. 

Long story short: I finally decided to stop by the local range (Okanogan Wildlife Council) to say hi at the office, and meet the crew. I pulled up to an amazing facility, with 200-400yd-ish range, gorgeous firing line...........no one there. No office, no shooters, no community 😆

I recently was introduced to matcha and enjoy the tea. I was curious if anyone else drinks higher end matcha in lattes? I am coming into matcha with a deep background in the specialty coffee/light roast espresso hobby. My latte recipe is simply 2-2.3 grams of of matcha shifted, 20ml of water at 170 Fahrenheit mixed then an additional 50ml and whisked with a chasen until frothy. I will then steam or use 175ml of cold oat milk to make my hot or iced latte. If I wanted to sample higher end matcha would I still be able to enjoy the different flavor profiles through this type of drink or does one need to drink it straight to get any perceived differences? Currently using Mizuba Tea Company Daily Matcha. The reason I ask is a lot of things resources online say to only use culinary for lattes, but I wasn't sure if that was more of a recommendation for those making sugary or sweet lattes.

I am a bit obsessive right now, but that is what I need to stay focused on my financial health. 

In the beginning, I just uploaded all my data. I categorized spending transactions and built up to see the trends for a few months. After that point, I could start working on the budget. I assign every dollar of income to a line item, including putting money in savings and paying off student loans (my next focus). Each morning, I make a cup of coffee and download the new transactions. If I am getting close to my spending cap or I go over, I know I have to move money from another line item. At the end of the month, I zero out the lines that weren't spent, and any extra goes towards additional savings transfers.

https://youtu.be/YRwb-eUrso4?si=vn_eS0ifTks-sPPg

 Below is just my opnion.

It feels like Limerence cause by someone who already has hyperfixation or obsessive tendency that fuel by imagination (usually someone who really good at writing or telling story) in changing they world perception on something or someone. 

It can cause by escapism from reality, soothing object or person, person they sexually attracted to, or hormonal. I kinda feel it world perception malfunction. Everyone has views on every person they met. They make little mind note, summary of the person they met. Like how I see Dr K as a doctor that used to be a monk. But Limerence people has malfunction on that perception. They change that perception based on feeling or imagination but hyperfixation turn imagination into fact in their brain. Using Dr K again, Limerence people might see Dr K as someone who good at making coffee because he works so much in his office so he must make and drink a lot of coffee and I love coffee so that's why I love Dr K. It might root in reality or assumption. The key point is, they have perception problem.

I got this conclusion from my observation with my friend and I. We both creative people but I more drawing and artistic imaginative while my friend is more writing and world building imaginative. She has Limerence while I dont. My friend really into this one singer. Make scrapbook of that guy. My friend has problem that she believes with her whole heart that this singer's wife should die because she wouldn't make the guy happy or what not. Like she even believe that the guy never happy with that person even tho the guy the one who confess and chase after his wife.

Thank god my friend didn't voodoo that wife but yea she did burn and scratch some X on the wife pictures. But on the other hand, I terrible at writing. I might has memory confusion since I can imagine me or someone doing something that didn't happen (schizo)

1kd11q8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd11q8,UPDATE: I tested twice my Vyvanse (brand vs. generic vs. older stock brand) blindly: and the results were definitive. It’s not placebo.,"
About 35 days ago, I posted here about my growing suspicion that my brand-name Vyvanse was losing potency, and that the Teva generic I’d tried felt like complete garbage. I even suspected the name brand had changed since last summer, because I’d started needing to top it up with Dexedrine just to function , even with better sleep and lower stress.

So I decided to test this properly.

⸻

Part One: Initial 3-Day Controlled Test

I picked three days where my hormones were stable (I’m female; cycle timing matters). Each day, I took a different pill:
	•	Day 1: March 2025 Name Brand Vyvanse (My usual). Still needed extra Dexedrine to function, but at least I functioned.
      •	Day 2: March 2025 Generic (Teva). 
Total collapse. Couldn’t get out of bed. Doom-scrolling, brain fog, couldn’t word-retrieve. Took sublingual Dexedrine just to move.
	•	Day 3: August 2024 Name Brand . I used to split these because they were too strong. Took it preemptively before getting out of bed and… BAM. Heart pounding. Fully awake. Wired. Felt like I took double the dose/ or how I did last year.

I figured maybe this was placebo or hormonal. So I reset for a full cycle and prepped a blind test.

⸻

Part Two: Blind Test (My Husband Randomized the Pills)

He labeled and locked away the pills the evening before each test day in a locked opaque pills box/tube (I have kids and they jump in the bed in the morning so I keep my meds locked in there so they can’t access them). I had no idea which one I was taking each day because I would pour the contents straight into my mouth without seeing its contents. 
	•	Day 1: Smooth day: I assumed I got the April 2025 brand again. Needed Dexedrine but not desperate. Usual lack of motivation on my takes. Took a coffee later that morning.
	•	Day 2: Again, total failure.  Zero effect. I spent 50 minutes on a task that should’ve taken 5. Slept early. Needed 7.5 mg Dexedrine to barely push through. Two coffees. Fog, no drive, no clarity. This had to be the Teva.
	•	Day 3: Boom. Heart pounding, immediate motivation : Didn’t need Dexedrine. No coffee. Jumped into writing a report first thing. Felt like pure lightning. Same jolt as the August 2024 pill. 

This order turned out being the same as last month because my husband confirmed the order was correct. 
⸻

What This Confirms for Me:
	•	There’s a huge, measurable difference in potency between pills.
	•	The Teva generic is worthless for me. Even opening it into yogurt did nothing.
	•	The name brand has also changed – the August 2024 ones were much stronger than the 2025 batch.
	•	This is not placebo. I randomized, blinded, timed it hormonally, and tracked the effects. It’s real. Heck, I even took the same protein shake before ingesting the pills in bed every time.

⸻

Next Steps: I Need Lab Testing Help

I still have:
	•	August 2024 brand-name Vyvanse
	•	September 2024 brand-name (not yet tested)
	•	April 2025 brand-name
	•	March 2025 Teva generic

I’m willing to pay out-of-pocket for third-party testing – potency, degradation, composition, whatever. I just need honest labs, not pharma-affiliated ones.

If you’ve had pills tested before, please drop recs below. I’m in Canada but open to U.S.-based labs too.

⸻

For the first time in six months, I have the motivation to clean my house. That’s how big the difference is.

⸻

TL;DR:
I blind-tested my Vyvanse (brand and generic) across batches. Teva was useless. Current name brand is weaker than august 2024 stock. I want to get all batches tested. Looking for lab recommendations: will pay out of pocket.

Let’s start with the positives. It *does* brew coffee. I mean, water goes in, brown liquid comes out — magic, right? It’s “fast & fresh brewed,” which really means “lukewarm and mildly flavored,” but hey, expectations are everything.

It’s also ""[travel mug friendly](https://amzn.to/4k3mzAh),"" which is great if your travel mug is tiny and your idea of travel is moving from your couch to your kitchen. The one-cup reservoir is a bold design choice — nothing says efficiency like filling the machine every. single. time. you want coffee. You like routines, right?

And don’t forget the reusable filter feature, perfect for feeling eco-conscious right before tossing 27 plastic K-Cups in the trash anyway.

But the best part? It’s *refurbished*. So if you’ve always wanted to own a coffee maker that’s already survived someone else’s Monday mornings and passive-aggressive kitchen rage, this one’s for you.

For the past month, I’ve been experiencing chest pain and decided to get it checked. I had an ECG, which came back normal, and the doctor referred me to a psychiatrist. I was prescribed medication for anxiety and to help with sleep.

For a few weeks, I felt normal and had no pain. Occasionally, there was mild chest pain, which I assumed was due to anxiety or panic attack.

However, this morning, I experienced a deep, stabbing pain on the left side of my chest. There was no sweating, dizziness, or shortness of breath. At times, felt numbness in my hands and arms. The stabing pain was occasional but it persisted throughout the day.

I went to the hospital again and had an ECG and got checked echocardiogram, which I did 2 days back. The cardiologist said everything looked normal and prescribed pantoprazole 40mg. (Got it checked by two different cardiologists.)

But the chest pain still persists and I'm worried. 


Pain is usually when I'm sitting or laying down. I go for brisk walk every morning  but never felt it  Also, sometimes chest pain is followed by passing gas.
I can't seem to recognize any other relevant pattern.

I don't smoke or drink but, I do consume coffee and tea on a regular basis.

What additional tests can I do to be reassured that the symptoms are not cardiac?

I wasn’t expecting much, especially since I usually see McAfee get roasted online, but figured why not try it before installing one of my usual go-tos from the free VPN Reddit threads like Windscribe or Proton.

It connected fast and didn’t totally kill my speed, which surprised me. I was able to browse, check emails, and even stream a few YouTube videos in 720p without buffering. But once I tried accessing a region-locked show on Netflix, it immediately gave me the proxy error. I also noticed it doesn’t give you many server options unless you upgrade to the premium plan, and the settings are super limited. It feels like something that’s built more for basic users who just want a “set it and forget it” kind of VPN.

Honestly, I’m thinking of switching back to Windscribe just for more control and better server access. Curious if anyone’s used McAfee VPN long-term, does it get any better, or should I just treat it like the antivirus version of a free VPN that’s fine for browsing but not much else?

It seems to get easier the longer you can go without..every day I'm having less urges. My body is feeling better, mental health is getting better..no more feeling bloated, sick, heavy, sad, and exhausted because I lost control again the night before. Hunger is feeling more manageable, food noise is slowly disappearing.

I was really worried for a while that this would be a constant, 24/7 battle every day for the rest of my life. But it doesn't seem to be, even after only 3 weeks.

The first week was really hard. I'd wake up in the night and just go stand in my kitchen, take a finger scoop of peanut butter (lol) instead of a huge binge, and go back to sleep. Been able to take a ""pause"" and actually recognize I don't actually want to eat, I've had enough food, and this is the disorder talking. Magnesium supplements seem to be helpful. 

I was bingeing 3-4 times per week, for over a year. This was the worst BED had ever been for me, even though it has been a struggle my entire life.

Anyway, just wanted to share. It really does seem like if you can white-knuckle your way through the first little while, and say ""no"" to the urge, it eventually starts to give up.

Hopefully this continues 🙏

Editing to add : Something else that has really helped lately - I almost never felt satisfied after a meal, which led to seeking a lot more food, and overdoing it often.

My hunger cues seem to be 20-30 minutes behind my brain? So I've been having a glass of water, a meal, either doom scrolling for 20-30 minutes or getting up to go do something else, and saying ""if I'm still hungry by then, I will eat more"". Sometimes also having a tea/coffee in that time frame.

Not once so far have I still been hungry after giving myself that space.

Checking out of my hotel (it’s raining but under the hotel canopy).
I have one check-in size luggage, a rolling laptop bag, my purse and I am holding a coffee.

Driver pulls up and doesn’t get out of the car to assist. Just pops the trunk. 
Set coffee down on ground and I bring my items over to the trunk and attempt to load - he has items in the trunk. Now I have to rearrange his items to make room for mine. I am clearly struggling. 
Takes about 4-5 min to make everything fit so I was able to close and secure the trunk. 

Pick up coffee get into car. He doesn’t greet me. Simply asks for a PIN code. 
Drive the short distance to my drop off location (less than 1 mile) only to repeat the process in reverse. Zero assistance. 
I gave him 2 stars and zero tip. 

Sorry, not sorry. If you want 5 stars and a tip (which I give 99.99% of the time) then you should at least say hello and you must assist with luggage (unless clearly handicapped/or communicate why you are unable to assist).

I have only one other time had someone not help with luggage and she was in her 8th month of pregnancy, but she stepped out of the car, greeted me, closed the trunk - everything but lift the heavy bags which is 100% acceptable and understandable under the circumstances.

I'd like to give away my Pilot Kakuno with a medium nib.

I bought this last month and have used it sparingly since. There's no issue with the pen or the nib, but the section diameter is just too big for me. When I write with it, I can see myself having to pause and frequently change my grip.

I've inked it with Pilot's Purple cartridge. I'd bought the Purple because I was on the lookout for a purple ink, and I'd heard great things about this ink. But as they say, one fountain pen lover's OMG! can be another's meh. I am not a fan of Pilot's Purple, and I don't think I will be using it. (I'm open to purple ink suggestions at the \~CNY 40/INR 500/ USD 6 price-point!)

I'd like to give away my Kakuno and the cartridge pack of Pilot Purple ink (which has 4 unopened cartridges, since 1 is currently hooked up to the Kakuno). If you:

* identify as queer\\woman and live anywhere in Asia
* have always wanted to try out the Kakuno/love the Kakuno and would like another
* would like to try out Pilot's Purple cartridge ink/love this ink and would like more

...let me know! I will send the pen cleaned along with the 4 unopened cartridges of Pilot Purple ink. (There was no converter with this pen.) My intentions on restricting this PIF to queer/women is because I know we exist, but we're hard to come across!

Please DM if you would like me to share videos or photos.

This giveaway is open for you to throw your hat in until Monday, 5th May, 7 pm IST (India Standard Time), i.e., the next 72 hours. I'll pick a random user from the comments using an online spinning wheel and reach out to the winner.

All the best!

PS: I also have a pack of Pilot's Brown cartridges with 4 of them unopened. I was not moved by this shade. Let me know if you'd like me to include that too. I probably sound like someone who really does not like Pilot - I do! My Metro is almost always in use, and I'm keen to try their bottled inks, particularly the Blue-Black. But yes, I am on the lookout for an affordable (for me) shade of coffee/dark brown and more-red-than-blue, warm purple ink.

1kd0qcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PPOPcommunity/comments/1kd0qcg/tried_listening_to_other_ppop_groups/,Tried listening to Other Ppop Groups,"I made a PPop Sampler playlist in Spotify with the express mission of giving Ppop groups a chance. I decided to take note of first impressions upon listening and watching the accompanying MVs.

So far, I am impressed. There’s variety. Pero ito talaga ang strength nating mga Pinoy: harmonies. I get frustrated with some Kpop groups kasi minsan parang mga solo singers lang na pinagsama-sama.

For this, I checked out the following groups suggested by Google: **Alamat, YGIG, Pluus, PHP, BGYO, MNL48, Yes My Love** and **Hori7on.** I watched two MVs per PPop group- one with the highest streams in Spotify and the other is their newest release.

Some disclaimers: These are musings of a Pinoy who sings well enough but knows next to nothing about technicalities in music production so there’s going to be a lot of “vibes”. I also did not include SB19 or Bini because I listen to them a lot. :D

**Maharani (Alamat)** \- So many Filipino elements in the MV plus there’s a Bini cameo. This song is peak Pinoy RnB that’s “swabe.” Sarap ulit-ulitin. The choreography looks great. My personal fave!

**Sa’yo Pa Rin Uuwi (Alamat)-** A ballad made for soft-hours. There’s subtle harmonies and the acappella gospel choir bridge sounds divine.

**Shaba Shaba (YGIG)**\- The MV looks low-budget but the rap line is \*chef’s kiss\*! I found it a bit annoying kasi masyadong matinis in some parts but I think it’s part of the concept because it’s supposed to sound like a children’s song.

**Universe (YGIG)**\- This reminds me of Gfriend’s early releases. It’s a bouncy song with pure vocals. The rap flow felt a bit out of place, though.

**Amigo (Pluus)**\- For a song released in 2023, this felt a bit dated. The “Amigo-go-go” hits so hard, though.

**Summotion (Pluus)** \- This has ""summer anthem"" potential because the vibe and instruments are similar to “Pantropiko”.  The MV was so cute too. Matagal ko na-gets na hindi pala siya lyric video. >.<  

**Lampara (PHP)** \- It’s a touching, upbeat song with a matching MV full of heart. For some reason, this sounds like a top-tier Station ID theme song.

**Pansamantala (PHP)** \- The BL storyline of the MV matched the song so well even if it’s not explicitly that kind of song. It sounds like a sad waltz. As an iyakin, naiyak ako.

**Tumitigil ang Mundo (BGYO)** \- I really love the quality of their voices. The choreography is crisp. The harmonies- solid!

**Andito Lang Ako (BGYO)** – This song’s alt rock style is very appropriate for BGYO’s charms - parang college rock band. Their voices are so distinguishable but work well together.

**Pag-ibig Fortune Cookie (MNL48)** \- This sounds like a cute version of Sexbomb songs with Japanese cadence. I have a feeling that this song will work even with Pinoy pronunciation. There were no distinct voices but there were lots of harmonies.

**Summertime (MNL48)** \- Wow! Is this the same MNL48? It’s totally different. There’s a lot of noticeable voices. This feels like a retro disco song.

**Laging Naroon Ka (Yes My Love)** – This is a cover of Jaya’s song. This version sounds like something Michael Pangilinan would release. If you like 2000s RnB with goosebumps-inducing harmonies, this is for you. Their voices have different flavors but they sound cohesive. They’re like the Pinoy version of G.O.D.!

**Coffee Date (Yes My Love)** \- Why??? This song is underwhelming compared to the RnB sound they had. This is more pop rock with One Direction as the inspiration.

**Sixteen (Hori7on)**\- It’s an upbeat song which matches their youthful and preppy MV. The stripped bass and vocals make for a strong impact in the “lalala” parts. It’s in Korean and I found that in some parts, their diction was questionable.  

**Cold (Hori7on)** \- The song is for easy listening. I can distinguish their voices very well. Laidback yung choreography but they manage to make it look fresh.",11,1746191875.0,PPOPcommunity,2,1.0,False

1kd0mjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurangabad/comments/1kd0mjc/cafes_to_try_out_freshlybrewed_speciality_coffee/,Cafes to try out freshly-brewed speciality coffee?,"I have been reading a-lot about freshly brewed coffee and was hoping to make a shift from instant coffee to freshly brewed coffee at home.

While i have some understanding of different level of roasts and grind sizes to pair with different equipment, i haven’t tried much apart from instant coffee.

I was planning to buying a frenchpress, Timemore c2 manual grinder and get the beans from bluetokai. 
But the setup is too expensive of an investment to make when i have too little of an understanding of what to expect from a fresh brewed cup of coffee.

Many online suggested that i should try different brews at local cafes first to get an understanding and be able to taste the flavour notes.

So 
Wanted to ask are there any cafes where they specify roast levels and coffee origins and stuff?

Tried google maps but there seems to be no local roasters (which is to be expected)

Coffee enthusiasts in the city—where did you all first start exploring coffee at? before getting a home setup?

Any recommendations are appreciated.

**AITA for refusing to get my best friend a wedding gift?**



I (23F) have known my best friend (24F), let's call her Maria, since we were babies. We have been inseparable our whole lives and she is like a sister to me. We both grew up in a poor area and our families struggle a lot with money. We are both in our final year of college now and I don't have a lot of money to spare - I have lots of student debt and I work two jobs to have enough money for food and rent, etc. We both go to a very prestigious college so we have worked very hard to get to where we are.

Around six months ago, Maria met a guy at the shop she works at, called Mike (33M). They started dating pretty quickly and Mike is very rich - he is the definition of living off daddy's money. At first I was a little bit skeptical as obviously Mike is quite a bit older than her but she seemed happy. After a month of them dating, Maria had changed a lot. She was missing lectures and tests to go on last-minute holidays to Dubai, Paris, New York, etc, and always coming back with designer accessories. After three months she moved in with Mike, which upset me as I had to sell our shared apartment because I could not afford rent by myself. I thought they were moving very quickly but I didn't want to seem jealous or petty by bringing it up.

Around a month ago, Mike proposed to Maria, and she accepted. I was happy for her, but after she told me her plans, I was shocked. Maria's dream since we were kids was to work for NASA and she has worked so hard for this - she has taken internships there and was planning to apply there for next year. But her new plan is to get married, graduate college and move to LA with Mike and become a housewife. The wedding is planned for this December and it is the most lavish, expensive wedding that you could think of. Her bridal shower is next week and she has asked me to be her maid of honor. While I don't approve of her plans, of course I said yes.

She's inviting me and some of her new, rich friends she's met through Mike to the shower, and she made a groupchat with all of us in. She sent us a list of the presents she wanted which took me by surprise because this list included designer items and luxury furniture that I could definitely not afford - the cheapest was $550!! I had planned to get her something sentimental and personal, not designer brands. While all the bridesmaids were discussing in the chat what they would buy for her I messaged her privately and apologised that I wouldn't be able to buy anything. She completely went off at me, saying that my financial issues shouldn't get in the way of her wedding. I got pretty upset as this isn't the Maria I've known my whole life and she is well aware of my issues with money. I told her that if this is the way she's acting, I wouldn't buy her anything at all.

She's removed me from the wedding party chat and I've had several angry messages from Mike and the bridesmaids telling me what a horrible friend I am. I'm feeling very conflicted about whether I'm in the wrong, AITA?



**Comments**



**Prudent\_Border5060**

*Nta But your friendship is over basically. Her values have changed. She isn't the same person anymore. And honestly there is some massive red flags in her relationship. You cannot help her in this regard. It's time to let her live her life the way she wants. Your lives aren't compatible anymore. She is placing a gift over your shared history. And what your friendship means. To be honest being a bridesmaid is very expensive. And with her taste it will be even more so. It sounds like she is putting having an expensive lifestyle over her own dreams. I think you need to do what's best for you. Do not go into debt for this wedding. I would decline being a last of the wedding party due to financial reasons. If she is a true friend she would understand.*

*Yup would not be surprised if Maria wants a weeklong luxury bachelorette in Turks and Caicos or something just as extravagant*

**Prudent\_Border5060**

*Yep. Honestly there is no OP could financially handle her expectations. You have to love the guilt card though. Her old friend is only to happy to spend other peoples money but if it means so much to her she would cover the costs.*

**CaptColten**

*NTA. She dumped you with a shared apartment that you cant afford, and then is mad you cant afford things? And your financial situation shouldn't ruin her wedding, like what? Does she think you're out here being poor just to spite her? Does she think you should just fall behind on your bills and skip a few meals so she can have a fancy handbag? This girl doesnt care about you, and she's made it very obvious.*

**Update - 15 days later**



Thank you everyone for your comments. It has been 3 weeks since I dropped out of the wedding party and I am still getting calls from Mike and the bridesmaids. I spoke to a couple friends and asked for advice and like a lot of comments said they advised just to be there for Maria and try to reach out if possible. I messaged her last week asking to meet for a coffee and after being left on read for a few days she agreed.

I spoke to her explaining my concerns about the marriage and why I decided to drop out of the wedding party. She stayed silent through all of it and when I finished she broke down in tears, so badly she couldn't speak. I took her back to my place and once she calmed down she explained what was really happening.

Like I said, Mike lives off his parents' fortune. Turns out his parents had a deal - he could only continue using their money as long as he got married by 35. As he was quickly reaching this deadline he found a young, pretty girlfriend and rushed into marriage so he could continue his luxury lifestyle. Maria found this out at family dinner back in July; Maria tried to confront him but he threatened her with taking all her money leaving her jobless & without an place to live. Mike's parents also have a prenuptial in the works and Maria confessed she has been stalling it as long as she can. She also explained to me that the bridesmaids/new 'friends' had been picked by Mike as daughters of his father's friends and they all made fun of Maria for being previously poor. Because of this she felt like she had to change hence the dramatic personality change and expensive registry.

It all went down after I dropped out of the party. Maria caught Mike cheating with an even younger girl, she found messages of them sexting and evidence of her coming to their house. She confronted him and he denied everything, deleted all evidence and tried gaslight her into thinking she made it up. She was sleeping in the spare room until we met up, and right now she's staying on the couch in my apartment. Last night she officially called off the engagement and both me and her have been receiving hateful messages all night.

We're making a plan at the moment to help her cut ties with Mike, get back on track with college and find a job again. I'm still mad at her for what she did to me and it will take a very long time for our friendship to get back on track but I am trying my best to support her. Again, thank you everyone for your comments and feedback, I really appreciate it. While she still has a long way to go, I am happy to see that the person I knew and loved is slowly coming back.

I’d come up with like 3 different plans with 3 different friend groups and in every single one of those groups the people I’m close with personally are out of town. 

Finals just ended this week so it makes sense, but it really does put a damper on things.

I’m in a college in Orlando which gives me a lot of options, but I don’t really know what to do. I have some individual friends outside of those groups I can definitely drink with, but idk if I want to do it with just 1 other person.

Idk I’m just feeling really depressed about it all, meanwhile all my coworkers and are telling me about how crazy their 21st’s were and I’m really feeling left out because I wanted that too.



Current options I’m looking at:

My mom booked a hotel for my friends and I to stay at tomorrow night up in jax (2 hours away), maybe I could use that somehow?
 
There’s a coffee shop I like that does chess saturdays. I’m not any good but it’s fun to go and play some lol. Maybe I’ll spend some time there but can’t do this and the hotel. Also doesn’t help with the whole wanting to get sloshed with people thing lol.

I have a hard party friend of mine that likes to plan stuff, maybe he can whip something up for me. I’ll message him after posting this to see what he thinks. Can’t do him and hotel tho he’s working til 5

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Let's say I go to a coffeeshop each day and buy a cup of coffee from there. 
This would mean:
-> Money flows in one direction. 
-> I either have to top up the channel in the beginning with enough BTC for multiple days or do on-chain transactions to top up the channel. 
-> The coffeeshop doesn't really get it's share of BTC until closing the channel, causing another on-chain transaction.
-> The transactions within the channel are less secure than on the main network. 

Maybe I'm getting something wrong, if so please explain. 
Now my questions:
1. I see why lighning is supposed to be reducing transactions, but since money doesn't often flow 2 ways between 2 parties, this is mainly a fancy way of bookkeeping for a prepayment of goods/services, right? 
2. This also means that if the business wants access to it's money it's interested in closing channels as soon as possible after the transaction, right?

1kd0c9l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd0c9l,Bye Freya (I hate thrips),"hello everyone, long time lurker here.  
I need your help making sense of this. At the end of January I bought a beautiful little Calathea at the store and I called her Freya. I put her, together with my coffee plant Lisa, into a small glass greenhouse. That was mostly a try on my end because I felt like the coffee plant was suffering from a lack of humidity.  
I kept both of them in this greenhouse. I did not change the soil. About two weeks ago I noticed a infestation of fungus gnats (I hope that's what they're called in English). So on Wednesday I gave out predatory mites to fight these. Today (Saturday) I noticed thrips all over my Calathea. I've had a long infestation of Thrips before, and the size and look as well as the damage to the plant seem to indicate to me that those are thrips again.  
So my questions:

1. Is it actually Thrips? I don't think these are like larvae from the mites right? I gave these out before and I could have sworn they didn't look like this.
2. If it's Thrips, how the fuck did it get there?
3. Could it be that the soil with which the mites came, had thrips larvae as well? (in this case I would be royally screwed).

There is no saving Freya btw, I already threw her out, just to be sure. I don't want to have to deal with a month long fight against these fuckers again.

Yesterday my boyfriend showed me a YouTube video of a comedian he likes interviewing gay comedians. I’m not usually into comedy, but I got interested when I heard “gay comedians,” so I watched with him. Honestly, I didn’t find it funny, but he really enjoyed it and we watched for quite a while.

In the middle of the interview, they were talking about the COVID lockdown. One comedian said, “Now you have to make your own coffee!” and another replied, “I’m not Laura Ingalls Wilder!” I chuckled. Yeah, right—she wrote a lot about home cooks.

So I said to him, “That was really funny,” and he replied, “It’s such a gay joke I don’t even get it and I’m gay!” That surprised me.

I went to school in Korea and Japan, and I first read Laura Ingalls Wilder in junior high in Japan. *Little House on the Prairie* was on our list for an overseas literature assignment. Students picked a country over break, read a representative author, wrote a report, and presented it. For the U.S., we read Kurt Vonnegut and Laura Ingalls Wilder,Mark Twain; for France, Victor Hugo. Our teacher told us that Wilder is to America what Natsume Sōseki is to Japan—a national literary icon.

I loved *Little House on the Prairie* and talked with teachers and classmates about how it reflects American life and values. I even imagined every American grew up reading it—just like every Japanese person has read Natsume Sōseki. 

So when my boyfriend said he’d never heard of Laura Ingalls Wilder, I was shocked. I asked, “You don’t know Laura Ingalls Wilder? *Little House on the Prairie*?” He said he’d never heard of her. I’ve always thought he’s very smart and well‑read—smarter than me—but he teased me, saying that expecting every American to know Wilder is ""stiflingly liberal.""

Out of curiosity, I asked my other American friends. Everyone I asked knew Wilder and had read *Little House on the Prairie*. When I told him today, he called it a “biased sample.” That got me wondering: Gay American redditors, do you know Laura Ingalls Wilder? Did you read *Little House on the Prairie* as a kid? Was she taught in your school curriculum? What role does she play in American literature?

We're adding a bakery, and we've been wanting to offer good coffee for a while. With the bakery we have products and staff to draw customers in the mornings, so coffee would be a natural accompaniment. In the past we've done big percolator batches, but there's a big drawback to that: 

because we're an organic farm, we kinda have to offer organic, fair-trade coffee, which is pretty expensive to throw out at the end of the day. But like anything, you never build the customer base by being wishy washy about how much or how often coffee is available. 

We know the commercial espresso machines are expensive and require maintenance, but we do have staff in the bakery who know how to use and maintain them. The benefit of that is that the coffee itself won't be wasted. But at what point does that trade-off make sense? I'd love some hard numbers on cups per day required to justify what price of machine. 

So im just looking for feedback on what machine combo makes the most sense financially, considering the organic, fair-trade bean thing, and considering that we still want to minimize our up-front investment. Can we get into an espresso machine for under 2 grand that will last a while? It's not going to get used as much as in a dedicated cafe, but there's potential it could get real busy.

Having used it extensively over the past months, I can confidently share my thoughts on this carry-on option. It has its highs and lows, and here's the breakdown of how it measured up based on my experiences.

**Design and Build Quality**

The exterior immediately caught my attention; its sleek, durable ABS material feels robust yet lightweight. Lifting it, even when fully packed, didn’t strain me—a huge plus for someone who detests lugging heavy bags around. It’s tough enough to withstand the trials of frequent travel, such as airport handling and storage compartments. Despite its sturdiness, the clean black finish gives it an elegant edge that fits whether you're on a professional trip or vacationing in style. The retractable molded handles with soft rubber grips were a welcome touch; they made carrying or pulling the luggage extremely comfortable. And let’s not forget, the 10-year warranty is a nice reassurance of quality.

**A Traveler’s Friend: Maneuverability**

The spinner wheels deserve an entire paragraph on their own because they’re that good. With four 360-degree multi-directional spinner wheels, moving through crowded airport terminals or down narrow airplane aisles became much more manageable. The wheels deliver a surprisingly smooth glide, though I noticed they struggled slightly on rougher outdoor terrain like cobblestone streets. Still, in normal airport and hotel settings, they performed excellently. It felt like the luggage moved alongside me without any effort.

**Expandable Capacity and Organization**

Packing has always been my Achilles’ heel—until I started using this suitcase. With 18.25 x 14 x 10 inches of packing space, I found that it could hold enough for a 5–7 day trip easily. Its split-case design expands when needed, which saved me countless times after indulging in some last-minute shopping. The interior features compartments and zipped pockets that help significantly with organization. It’s particularly handy if you're one of those people, like me, who loves to keep everything in place. I was even able to fit small electronics and toiletries in their specific sections for quicker access during TSA checkpoints.

**Unique Features and Clever Additions**

One of the standout extras was the cup holder integrated on the back of the luggage. I didn’t think much of it at first glance, but mid-coffee at an airport gate? Genius! It’s small details like these that elevate the experience. The steel, push-button locking telescopic handle felt incredibly sturdy and functional. Unlike cheaper-feeling alternatives, this one didn’t wobble while rolling the bag or pulling it upstairs. It performed as seamlessly as I could ask for!

**Highlights**

- Lightweight and durable ABS hardshell.
- Intuitive spinner wheels for smooth navigation.
- Expandable for extra packing space.
- Convenient cup holder addition.
- Sturdy, adjustable telescopic handle.

**Critiques**

The luggage isn’t without its pitfalls. Although the handles and wheels are sturdy, the zippers left a bit to be desired. While functional, they felt a bit stiff and didn’t glide as smoothly as I expected. On one occasion, I had to use extra care while zipping it closed, mainly when it was fully packed. There's also the question of wheel durability; during a cobblestone street adventure in Europe, the rubber on a wheel slightly wore down. Lastly, one minor issue was the absence of additional zippered mesh compartments, which would have been handy for packing smaller items.

- Zippers could operate more smoothly.
- Rubber on wheels not ideal for rough terrains.
- Lack of extra small interior compartment pockets.

**Competing Brands**

When comparing this to similarly priced luggage like the Samsonite Omni PC or the American Tourister Bon Air, the SwissGear 7366 tends to outshines its peers in certain aspects—especially maneuverability. The Samsonite Omni may have a better track record for durability on harsher terrains, but it lacks the thoughtful features like the cup holder or the expandable storage ability that sets this suitcase apart. Meanwhile, the American Tourister Bon Air looks good and is comparable in weight, but the SwissGear feels more polished, especially with the telescopic handle’s stability.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

The cost efficiency of this luggage strikes a fine balance. Considering its thoughtful design, practicality, durability, and convenient features, it feels like a worthwhile investment if you’re someone who travels a few times a year. While not perfect, these niggling issues don’t overshadow the overall functionality and style of the bag. For its price point, it’s delivering plenty of value for someone seeking long-term usability and travel comfort. It’s a quality travel companion without dipping too heavily into your budget.

So I’ve realized lately that I’m at that point in my coffee journey where I don’t really enjoy most café coffees anymore—unless they’re exceptionally well made. I find myself preferring my home brews using manual methods (like pour-over, mokapoth, or French press) over the typical espresso-based drinks from cafés.

It’s not that I hate espresso or lattes, but I just feel like many cafés serve overly bitter, poorly extracted shots or drown everything in milk and syrups. At home, I can dial in my grind, water temp, and brew time exactly how I like it—and it tastes clean, balanced, and more nuanced.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Is this just a phase or does the appreciation for manual methods over café espresso drinks stick around long-term?",9,1746189976.0,IndiaCoffee,5,0.85,False

[[Part 1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/s/bUeMY9tCxE) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/s/kxkZfKhRuX). Part 3

It had been a month and two days. Tri'veek remained stood in the commons area, levitating in a precise form of silence. Henry and Jordan visited him frequently during this period of time. Sometimes individually, occasionally together, rarer yet they would bring other crew members who had not yet been introduced to the ships resident stowaway. 

Tri'veek had little awareness of his small cult following, his gaze remained transfixed towards the artificial and encouraging constellation of mankind's design. He may have remained in that state for a great while longer if not for the feeling of a familiar presence in a nebula the Keeshaw was fast approaching.

Henry was in the midst of leading a demonstration of why we do 'not the Tri'veek' by gently placing a pair of long-johns atop the Stirling form with a janitorial implement. 

Tri'veek's awareness slowly receded from the space around their vessel to its origin point. The long John's had taken on a distended and foreign appearance, stretching along a dozen faltering orbital paths around Tri'veek. Curiosity and fascination lit the faces of the three crew members who had joined this educational seminar. Triveek waited patently as the longjohns slowly became stretched so thinly the humans could no longer percieve them. 

A round of cheers followed. Apparently this had become a rather routine happening. Tri'veek had initial concerns of the humans acceptance as a whole, thinking Henry and Jordan to be unique specimens. Henry had apparently been putting great efforts to remove these doubts. 

""These memes. How do they relate to one another. You label them similarly but all I have bore witness to was the rapid acceleration of entropy.""

Tri'veeks sudden burst managed to illicit a startled yelp from Henry, as well anamused eound of laughter at both the reaction and the enigmatic beings query of befuddlement.

"" I uh.. wasn't sure how long you'd be out big guy. I uhh... took care of introductions for you with the rest of the crew. "" , a moment of hesitation,

""I actually had someone else to introduce you to for that specific reason. Jordan and I got to talking on why memes might have been a bit much based on what you told me about gods and shit.""

""But I feel that this new stuff will make it worse.""

Tri'veek paused for an hour while the crew dispersed and Henry went to grab an advice and some coffee. Henry was quick to return and sat, enjoying the bitter drink and silence of the morning. 

""Understanding is the path to ideatic evolution. Learning this 'new stuff' cannot be worse than this void of knowledge."" Tri'veek once more broke the silence.

Henry took another deep sip before standing, gesturing for Tri'veek to follow. He was given as wide birth as the man and illuminate schiss made their way to the tertiary command deck. A humble command center nestled at the rear of the ship between the numerous void shifters that dragged the Keeshaw forward. A shielded windows provided a brilliant view of the fracaline wake as the shifters fractured and reassembled space frantically.

In the the forgotten distance, an abandoned paper cup sat defeated, discarded. Watching passersby. Cooling ominously to room temperature. 

""Tri'veek, this is Geoff. He is the vice chief of the scientific wing of the Keeshaw's expedition. I told him was you told me. Ideas that take on ecological roles of predator prey. Becoming solid. Says he has a way to explain what Jordan showed you.""

Henry remained in the doorway with an arm propositioned Tri'veek to advance into the command deck. Geoff, for all his brilliance, had the observational awareness of a broken projector. Blindingly bright, but not functioning as intended. He had not realized the Oblique mass' presence nor heard Henry's loudly obnoxious introduction.

Tri'veek silently approached from behind, propelling himself on strands of hardlight. 

""I have become aware you have an explanation for memes.""

Geoff jumped nearly jumped from his skin when his attention was violently ripped from the screen and every fibre of his being became aware of the pearlescent fragmentation of all he had known to be true that loomed mere feet from him.

This was the first human Tri'veek was aware of to have such a negative reaction to his presence. Henry was quick to calm Geoff and sit him down, reminding the man  
had forewarning and ample time to mentally prepare, while simultaneously coaching him through breathing excersizes.

For Henries simplicity and skepticism, Tri'veek  had come to know that the man's presence seemed to have a soothing effect on the other humans. Tri'veek's appreciation of both the individual and species itself grew in these moments.

Once Geoff had calmed himself, it was as though a switch had flipped. Gone was the timid frightened man, in his place an impassioned youth given the opportunity to talk about a subject of fascination.

""So if I understand correctly from what Henry told me, for all other species, ideas tend towards taking literal, physical form, is this correct?""

""The literallity varies, though physicality is a constant."" Tri'veek responded.

""I can understand you confusion. Going from a  universe of absolutes to one in flux must have been jarring.""

""It ... agitating..""

""Instead of attempting to explain the images themselves, it would probably be better to explain the word itself. Meme. Derived from Memetics, which itself is derived from genetics. Came about as a failed scientific field to track the spread and mutation of ideas across a population, as you might a gene. Hence meme.""

There was a palpable silence. Several of the moniters and computing devices experiences the most infinitesimal of delay as the mass of the air in the room increased by an imperceptible amount. 

""What do you mean spread and mutate?"" Tri'veek asked in disbelief 

""Well that's why it's failed. Every human mind percieves every piece of information in a unique way and holds its interpretation of the world it's presented. How this data is recording affects how the idea is transformed. A picture of a house provides a more absolute image, but relies on our eyes which are flawed. The red I see might be different from henries. If house is written, our minds fill in the blanks, no matter how descriptive. And how these blanks are filled will vary from.person to person. And then there's language and translation and a while host of other issues...""

Geoff continues to trail off for some time, Tri'veek say in in both silent horror and contemplation.

1kczycy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kczycy/will_the_tohonfoo_coffee_maker_mat_truly_protect/,Will the TOHONFOO Coffee Maker Mat truly protect your countertop? A detailed review!,"Testing out the TOHONFOO CM-REC-20-15-BK Silicone Coffee Maker Mat has been quite the experience for me, especially being a daily coffee drinker who happens to value a clean and scratch-free countertop. With its generous dimensions of 19.7"" x 15"", the mat is a practical size for most coffee machines, and it doesn’t just protect—it's a multitasking wonder. The raised 3/5"" edge is like an unsung hero, holding in any accidental coffee spills before they turn into a sticky mess on my kitchen counter.

**Features That Deliver a Real Punch**

The first thing I noticed was its high-quality silicone material. This mat isn’t flimsy or cheap-feeling—it’s sturdy, flexible, and incredibly soft to the touch. I’ve had it endure the heat of my espresso machine during a busy morning rush, and not a single warp or deformity appeared. Its heat resistance and waterproof build make it a game-changer for anyone who frequently uses coffee appliances.

But let’s talk about the non-slip surface because, seriously, who enjoys having their coffee maker shift every time they press a button or lean against the counter? Thanks to this mat, my coffee maker stays firmly in place like it has glue holding it to the surface. I even tested it with some external force (okay, maybe I bumped into it while multitasking), and it still didn’t budge.

[Looking for TOHONFOO CM-REC-20-15-BK discounts? Check Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0cwh4q7mv/)

**Practicality and Daily Versatility**

One thing about this coffee maker mat is its versatility. Initially, I thought it’d live solely under my coffee machine. However, after trying, I discovered it’s perfect for other uses as well. For instance, you can pop it under the sink to catch any drips, use it as a pet feeding mat, or even place potted plants on it to protect surfaces. My neighbor borrowed it for their cat’s litter box—it worked wonders in maintaining a clean area. It’s also dishwasher-safe, so cleaning up is ridiculously easy.

**Key Benefits**

- High-quality, durable silicone material ensures longevity.  
- Raised edges keep spills contained, saving countertops.  
- Multifunctional use beyond housing the coffee maker.  
- Heat-resistant and waterproof, suitable for hot beverage appliances.
  
**Some Areas for Improvement**

While I’ve mostly enjoyed using this mat, I did notice a few nitpicky details:  

- The size, while great for most coffee makers, might be overkill for compact appliances. It almost covered an entire section of my tiny apartment counter.  
- Its flexibility makes it easy to store, but folding it a lot could leave slight creases that take time to flatten out.  

**Alternative Offerings in the Market**

I compared this mat with similar products, including one from a popular competitor in the coffee industry (let’s call them ""Brand X""). Brand X offers a mat that’s slightly thinner but also lacks the 3/5"" raised edge. While it might cater to someone looking for minimalism, it doesn’t offer the same level of counter protection. Another contender focused on aesthetics over functionality, but that didn’t win me over—the silicone used wasn’t heat-resistant and warped under prolonged heat exposure. 

On the other hand, the TOHONFOO mat excels with its resistance to heat and liquid, making it more practical for daily coffee brewing. However, one rival did offer additional color options, which is something I missed here. A black mat is versatile enough, but some folks enjoy matching their accessories to their kitchen decor—you know, coffee mats in bright reds or whites could feel like a nice touch.

**Price Performance Worth Discussing**

Discussing pricing without giving away exact numbers, the TOHONFOO CM-REC-20-15-BK really balances quality with affordability. It costs more than cheaper, thinner mats, but the durability and premium-grade silicone pay off in the long term. In comparison to high-end designer mats, it offers much more value for its modest price range. For practical coffee enthusiasts or people with busy households, this is a smart way to invest in protecting your countertops as well as adding convenience to your coffee routine.

The CASABREWS 4700Gense Espresso Machine impresses with its 20-bar pressure system, milk frother, and adjustable temperature settings—features I had wanted for ages. Obviously, there’s much to discuss, like what it does exceptionally well and where it stumbles.

**Design and Build Quality**

Opening the box, the first thing I appreciated was the brushed stainless steel exterior. It looks modern, complements my kitchen decor effortlessly, and feels durable to the touch. It's sized conveniently at 12.2"" x 7.9"" x 15.5"", which fits snugly on my counter without dominating the entire space. The detachable 51 oz water tank simplifies the refilling process, although I found myself wishing it had a water level indicator on the front to avoid errors when in a hurry. Every element—from the buttons to the steam wand—adds to its no-nonsense design aimed at reliability.

**Make Your Favorite Coffee Brewing Simple**

This machine turns you into a home barista with ease. The 20-bar professional pump blew me away with how effortlessly it extracted the coffee’s aroma and flavor. I made lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and even Americanos, all with just a few button presses. My coworkers were surprised I hadn’t hit the corner coffee shop in weeks. Surprisingly, the single and double-shot pre-programmed options deliver consistent results. Brewing two espressos simultaneously for my companion and me really saves time during the hectic mornings.

**[Check CASABREWS 4700Gense price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d1v1cdn1/)**

**Latte Frothing and Foam Texture**

Frothing milk became almost therapeutic for me. The steamer wand delivers creamy and textured microfoam, though the process can feel slightly constrained due to its shorter length. It works like a charm for standard latte art and cappuccino foam. If milk is your thing, invest in a slightly larger frothing pitcher because the included one feels cramped when milk doubles in volume as it steams. Even my children, eager to try coffee-making, picked up steaming on their first attempts.

**Upsides**

- Compact size is perfect for smaller kitchens.  
- 20-bar pump ensures authentic espresso extraction.  
- User-friendly control panel for easy navigation.  
- Customizable temperature for personalized tastes.

**Areas of Concern**

- The steaming wand could use a bit more length for increased flexibility.  
- Double-shot programming is slightly finicky—timing is everything.  
- Noise level during operation is on the louder side, especially during steaming.  

**Included Accessories Impressively Thoughtful**

CASABREWS goes above and beyond with its included components. The tamper’s weight feels just right in hand, and the provided milk frothing pitcher is a nice touch for beginners venturing into at-home latte creation. A small tamper mat is also provided, although its edge-resting design made it inconvenient for seamless storage on my kitchen counter. After multiple uses, it became second nature to grab the accessories quickly, but I’d still recommend upgrading some components for coffee enthusiasts seeking more precision.

**Direct Competitors**

Comparing this machine with other espresso makers in its league highlights its big advantages and smaller niggles. Against something like the Breville Bambino Plus, the CASABREWS edges ahead with a larger water tank but falters slightly in steam wand versatility. The De’Longhi Dedica, on the other hand, competes well with its swivel frother but lacks the professional-grade 20-bars offered here. The CASABREWS essentially bridges the gap between niche professionals and casual users, striking a nice balance between affordability and quality.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering the features packed into this product, it's an effort in affordable luxury. Though premium espresso makers might boast advanced systems like PID controllers or pre-infusion, this machine aligns itself with budget-conscious buyers who don’t want to compromise. I also appreciated its semi-automatic operation for the level of control it offers without feeling overwhelming. Given its consistent performance in key areas, I genuinely consider this money well spent on a product of its caliber.

I'm planning to travel to Colombia very soon, at the beginning of June, till mid July, total of 6-7 weeks.  
It's my first time traveling in Colombia, and in Latin America in general. I'm from Greece and I have a decent level of Spanish.

The idea is to arrive in Bogotá, spend a few days there, and then take a bus to the Coffee Region. I want to do a week or so of volunteering at a coffee farm near Armenia, and then spend a 4-5 days in some places traveling a bit norther: Salento, Filandia, Santa Rosa de Cabal, and Jardín.

From Jardín, I plan to take another bus to Medellín. Stay just 1 or 2 days, and then maybe try San Rafael for another week of volunteering.   
  
Back to Medellin to take a flight to Leticia.   
  
Stay around 8-9 days for volunteering in the Amazon, and then take a flight from Leticia back to Bogotá. And from there back to Greece. 

Does this plan make sense or am I being a bit too optimistic?

Thanks for the help!

I'm a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, and I'm looking for female friends who would like to chat and maybe even become good friends.

I'm really into art! Whenever I have free time, I love drawing and painting. I enjoy visiting art galleries, going to the theater, and watching movies. I once volunteered at a theater, which made me fall in love with acting and performance arts. Besides that, I love watching all kinds of movies and series, especially about history, politics, and nature, but I also enjoy something fun and lighthearted. Right now, I’m really into the series *Cunk on Earth*.

I love reading books, from classics to psychology. My favorite literature is Lithuanian, and my favorite book is *Tūla*.

Music is also a big part of my life. I listen to all kinds of genres, from classical and jazz to electronic music. Some of my favorite artists are Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Kamanių Šilelis, Alina Orlova, The Be Good Tanyas, and many more.

I’m always curious and love learning new things, so I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, and psychology.

I also love going on walks, whether it's strolling through the old town, walking in parks, or by the river. In summer, I enjoy cycling, wandering through fields and meadows, swimming in lakes, and watching the sunrise and sunset.

**LIGHTING THE DARK PAST**

>

No longer is my past an autobiography; it is a reference book to be taken down, opened and shared. Today as I report for duty, the most wonderful picture comes through. For, though this day be dark – as some days must be – the stars will shine even brighter later. My witness that they do shine will be called for in the very near future. All my past will this day be a part of me, because it is the key, not the lock.

**Twenty-Four Hours A Day**  
**May 2**  
**A.A. Thought For The Day**

In A.A. we often hear the slogan “Easy Does It.” Alcoholics always do everything to excess. They drink too much. They worry too much. They have too many resentments. They hurt themselves physically and mentally by too much of everything.  So when they come into A.A., they have to learn to take it easy. None of us knows how much longer we have to live. Its probable that we wouldn’t have lived very long if we had continued to drink the way we used to. By stopping drinking, we have increased our chances of living for a while longer.  *Have I learned to take it easy?*

**Meditation For The Day**

You must be before you can do. To accomplish much, be much.  In all cases, the doing must be the expression of the being.  It is foolish to think that we can accomplish much in personal relationships without first preparing ourselves by being honest, pure, unselfish, and loving. We must choose the good and keep choosing it, before we are ready to be used by God to accomplish anything worthwhile. We will not be given the opportunities until we are ready for them. Quiet times of communion with the Higher Power are good preparation for creative action.

**Prayer For The Day**

I pray that I may constantly prepare myself for better things to come. I pray that I may only have opportunities when I am ready for them.

**Imagination Can Be Constructive, p. 157**

We recall, a little ruefully, how much store we used to set by imagination as it tried to create reality out of bottles. Yes, we reveled in that sort of thinking, didn’t we? And, though sober nowadays, don’t we often try to do much the same thing?

Perhaps our trouble was not that we used our imagination. Perhaps the real trouble was our almost total inability to point imagination toward the right objectives. There’s nothing the matter with truly constructive imagination; all sound achievement rests upon it. After all, no man can build a house until he first visions a plan for it.

**May 2**  
**Look out for the power trips**  
**Understanding hidden motives**

We can often use a lofty reason to disguise a hidden motive behind our actions. We might be seeking power over people’s lives, for example, while claiming that “we’re only out to help them.” We may argue for a point of view only to establish a position of power. Such power trips are destructive, and others usually see them for what they really are.

If we’ve really accepted the principles of the Twelve Steps, we have no need for power trips. The logic of Step Eleven, for example, is that we’ll always have the power needed to carry out what’s in line with God’s will for us. We do not have to jostle and manipulate others to establish our importance or our authority.

When we really come to terms with our own tendencies to take power trips, we’ll be able to deal with others who come on strong with their power trips. We’ll soon perceive that such threats usually fade when we refuse to resist them or be upset by them.

*I’ll undoubtedly meet people today who are maneuvering for power in different situations. I will neither criticize nor oppose them. My responsibility today is to avoid any of my own tendencies to take such power trips.*

Most of us want to be happy. We just don’t know how. We aren’t sure what happiness is. We’ve learned the hard way that some things we wanted didn’t make us happy. We’re learning that happiness comes when we live the way our Higher Power wants us to live. That’s when we’re honest. When we do our best work. When we are a true friend. We make happiness; we don’t find it. Sometimes we don’t even know we’re happy. We’re too busy with our work, our recovery program, our friends and family. We need to slow down and know that when we do what we need to, happiness comes.

**Prayer for the Day:** Higher Power, help me know that I’m most happy when I listen to You and do Your will. You know better than I do what makes me happy.

**Action for the Day:** What parts of my program am I most happy about? Today I’ll think of these and enjoy myself.

**Each Day a New Beginning**

We defeat ourselves with labels. We hem ourselves in; we shorten our vision; we cut off opportunities in the making. We influence how others think of us, too. Someone wise said that we teach others how to treat us. Are we teaching people to expect nothing great from us because we are always afraid? Do we shatter their vision of our potential by never thinking we can handle what may come?

We become the persons we have programmed ourselves to be. We can revamp the program, anytime. And right now is a good time to begin. We are surrounded by persons who have done just that.

It’s time for praise. We are all that we need to be, and more. We will be helped to do all we are asked to do. We have an inner beauty that only needs encouragement to shine forth. If we smile from within today, we will free ourselves from our negative cages. A new life awaits us.

**May 2**  
**A LATE START**

– “It’s been ten years since I retired, seven years since I joined A.A. Now I can truly say that I am a grateful alcoholic.”

Finally on one cold winter day, I called Alcoholics Anonymous, and that evening two ladies took me to a meeting. We had a twenty-five minute ride in the car, and I remember how good it was to talk about my fear and shakes, how kind they were without encouraging my self-pity. I remember being given a cup of coffee I could hardly handle and hearing impossible promises that would materialize if i would only make the impossible commitment. I did want to stop. The ladies suggested that I go to a women’s meeting the next night, and I did. I had a drink first, of course, and when it came time to identify myself, I stated that my brain told me I was an alcoholic but the rest of me didn’t believe it. The next night it snowed, and I stayed home and drank. That was the end of my first try at A.A.

**The Language of Letting Go**  
**May 2**  
**Our Higher Power**

For the next twenty-four hours …

In recovery, we live life one day at a time, an idea requiring an enormous amount of faith. We refuse to look back – unless healing from the past is part of today’s work. We look ahead only to make plans. We focus on this day’s activity, living it to the best of our ability. If we do that long enough, we’ll have enough connected days of healing living to make something valuable of our life.

I pray for knowledge of Your will for me only.

We surrender to God’s will. We stop trying to control, and we settle for a life that is manageable. We trust our Higher Power’s will for us – that it’s good, generous, and with direction.

We’re learning, through trial and error, to separate our will from God’s will. We’re learning that God’s will is not offensive. We’ve learned that sometimes there’s a difference between what others want us to do and God’s will. We’re also learning that God did not intend for us to be codependent, to be martyrs, to control or care take. We’re learning to trust ourselves and for the power to carry that through.

Some of recovery is accepting powerlessness. An important part of recovery is claiming the power to take care of ourselves.

Sometimes, we need to do things that are frightening or painful. Sometimes, we need to step out, step back, or step forward. We need to call on the help of a Power greater than ourselves to do that.

We will never be called upon to do anything that we won’t be empowered to do.

*Today, I can call upon an energizing Power Source to help me. That Power is God. I will ask for what I need.*

**Say when it’s enough**

“Say when,” my friend says as she refills my glass, meaning she wants me to tell her when I have enough juice.

Saying when is a simple idea that we can use in our daily lives, as well. Sometimes there is no visible end to the troubles that beset us, and all we can do is seek shelter from the storm. But often, it’s up to us to decide when we have had enough. An irritant might be just a minor inconvenience for a while, but the longer it lingers, the more irritating it becomes. Say when. Say that you have had enough and refuse to let the irritant into your life anymore.

A draining person can latch on to a sympathetic ear. Know when that person is starting to take more than you are willing to give. Say when. The same can also be true of good things. Some of my friends like to make five, seven, and even ten or more skydives in a single day. I don’t. I love the sport, but I also know when it becomes too much of a good thing for me. I say when.

*God, help me know and respect my limits.*

|""*There is one thing more than anything else that will defeat us in our recovery; this is an attitude of indifference or intolerance toward spiritual principles.*""|
|Basic Text, p. 18|
|When we first came to NA, many of us had great difficulty accepting the spiritual principles underlying this program-and for good reason. No matter how we'd tried to control our addiction, we'd found ourselves powerless. We grew angry and frustrated with anyone who suggested there was hope for us, because we knew better. Spiritual ideas may have had some bearing on other peoples' lives, but not on ours.Despite our indifference or intolerance toward spiritual principles, we were drawn to Narcotics Anonymous. There, we met other addicts. They'd been where we'd been, powerless and hopeless, yet they'd found a way not only to stop using but to live and enjoy life clean. They spoke of the spiritual principles that had pointed the way for them to this new life of recovery. For them, these principles were not just theories but a part of their practical experience. Yes, we had good reason to be skeptical, but these spiritual principles spoken of by other NA members really seemed to work.Once we admitted this, we didn't necessarily accept every single spiritual idea we heard. But we did start to think that, if these principles had worked for others, just maybe they'd work for us, too. For a beginning, that willingness was enough.|

I'm 35F from EU with muscle pain and stiffness. I walk like a penguin after waking up. Walking gets easier during the day & after lots of coffee. Pain comes usually in the evening. Unless after stretching the pain was pretty shocking. My ck was normal last year. 

I got worried as my uncle (70+) died this year and he had pretty bad myotonia and muscle atrophy. He was in wheelchair. He told myotonia + muscle atrophy was herited from his father but he didn't mention if he knew the disease type. My father (70+) is his brother and he has muscle cramps. He can walk tho. But my father avoids doctors like the plague, so I don't know if he has got myotonia or muscle atrophy going on. He got an ear implant in his fifties.

Since I mostly build solo, I like to think that Theo is the CEO while VLRevolution is the dev - a clear separation of concerns.

I'm a self-studied full-stack developer, passionate about designing the best user experiences possible.

A revolution was brewing, but it took another six months before I wrote the first lines of code for what would eventually become UNI AI. The first commit was June 21, 2023.

The world had suddenly changed. We now had computers that could *think*, even if imperfectly. It was clear they would only get better. For me, this was proof that the ""singularity,"" predicted by great thinkers from von Neumann to Kurzweil, was real and near.

Personally I believe that singularity is the moment each of us becomes superhuman by leveraging AI to transcend the limits of time, resources, and knowledge. I believe in the limitless potential within us all, and UNI AI aims to provide the tools and ecosystem to help you realize it.

But it wasn't always called UNI AI. Inspired by this new wave of AI, I sought a world-changing idea. To be honest, back then, I was still healing from emotional wounds, battling my vices. On one fateful evening, self-medicating with some herbs, my mind raced, conjuring a vision: the next generation of apps, programs that mostly design and build themselves.

That was the lightbulb moment: a universal library of next-gen apps, easily built with just willpower and thought. A future where ideas are currency. This vision remains core to UNI AI – building a community-powered ecosystem where *your* unique knowledge, experiences, and skills are invaluable and can even be monetized through what we call the UNI CREATOR ECONOMY (more on that later!).

In a moment of inspiration, I named the project UNIAPP – the universal app, the last app you'd ever need. The tagline flowed naturally: ""UNIAPP - Dream, Design, Deliver.""

**Navigating the Labyrinth: Early Hurdles & Lessons**

In a rush of excitement, I started building a prototype to show a close friend and long-time business partner. Months flew by as I dove into the trenches. Naively, I thought a prototype would take just a few months. Big mistake! I was still relatively new to *app* development, despite being a senior full-stack developer.

>**Lesson:** Don't underestimate app development vs. web development. It’s a different beast. Always budget extra time for research & skilling up. Use downtime from slow progress to study & test.

The complexity was overwhelming. To speed things up, I leaned into automation.

>**Lesson:** Automations combined with AI are truly game-changing, especially for solo builders. A series of simple scripts (Node.js/TypeScript worked for me) inputting & outputting prompts & data can go a very long way!

By the end of summer 2023, I had a working prototype with over 2000 AI-generated ""chatlets"" (our term for these AI-powered apps). It was a dream realized, even if far from launch-ready. An app that built itself!

**The UNIAPP Setback & Rebirth as UNI AI**

Frustrated with the slow pace and feeling the pressure, I considered finding a co-founder to help raise capital. To pitch effectively, I needed to solidify the UNIAPP brand. That meant doing what I should have done on day one: checking for trademarks.

Fatefully, UNIAPP was already registered by an education application company. My beloved brand shattered instantly. Letting go was painful; I'd already registered domains and poured my identity into the name.

>**Lesson:** Check trademarks EARLY! And when setbacks hit, it's okay to feel down. Take time to grieve until you find the courage to pick yourself back up.

As the saying goes, ""it is what it is."" When life didn't give me UNIAPP, I eventually created UNI AI – a unique name that clearly reflects our mission: a universal AI platform.

**The Human Element: Partnerships, Funding & Resilience**

I offered my friend equal partnership: I'd build, he'd handle business and fundraising. This proved challenging. Lingering issues from a past venture, coupled with his doubts about UNI AI's ambitious scope, created friction.

>**Lesson:** Never partner with somebody who doubts the core vision. Passion can't be forced.

The nail in the coffin might have been OpenAI launching the GPT Store in January 2024 – an idea seemingly identical to UNIAPP, making us feel obsolete.

>**Lesson:** Never think your idea is unique. Assume competition exists or is coming. This builds confidence in your *own* execution and differentiation.

As one partnership faded, another formed. The very first member of an online community I'd started years ago became a small, early investor, believing in the vision when others wavered.

But bootstrapping remained incredibly difficult. Finding the time to build solo while sustaining myself felt like a constant battle.

>**Lesson:** Bootstrapping requires resilience, frugality, and unwavering faith. Be prepared for the grind. Be frugal, pursue scrappiness, and don't lose faith. Your Dreams need you!

I juggled part-time web development, freelance automation jobs, and even a full-time role for a few months, alongside taking loans from family. It’s the reality of building something from nothing.

**Refining the Vision: The Growth and Creation Engine (Mid-2024 - End 2024)**

Throughout 2024, I wrestled with UNI AI's unique value proposition while steadily building foundational features. I knew staying private was crucial to uphold our community commitment – building the AI project we all deserve, where value flows back to the users who build it.

Simultaneously, I was navigating personal challenges stemming from a failed relationship.

>**Lesson:** Avoid falling in love with someone not cut out for the startup life if you're pursuing a demanding dream. The paths often conflict. Fall in love with your dreams first; honor your personal journey. I now consider myself married to my business.

This period forced introspection. Starting in autumn 2024, I committed fiercely to my health – no compromises. It was time to heal.

>**Lesson:** The easiest way to lose focus is to neglect your health out of spite for past events. Forget what happened; focus on what you can make happen *now*.

My routine became rigorous: wake up, breathwork & meditation in the sun, mantras (self-love, gratitude, inner wealth), a 70-minute run (starting smaller and building up is key!), shower (finishing ice cold), simple breakfast, then deep work. An hour walk mid-day for brainstorming (my best ideas come then!), dinner, rest, more work, and finally, 1-1.5 hours of yoga (essential for preventing running injuries!). I even gave up coffee, finding more peace and better sleep without it (though I know that's polarizing!).

>**Lesson:** A holistic health routine (mind & body) is non-negotiable for sustained high performance and clarity, especially when bootstrapping. Find practices that resonate and sustain *you*.

This commitment brought clarity. I realized my earlier focus was flawed. I'd been trying to build an AI *better* than humans, potentially replacing us. Depressing, right?

The real lightbulb moment: What if AI didn't replace us, but *empowered* us to become our best selves? An AI fighting alongside us, revealing our limitless potential? That felt *empowering*.

This insight reignited my passion. UNI AI's true identity emerged: **""The Growth and Creation Engine,""** helping users **""10X Your Life.""** The focus shifted to building the Core Collections and \~80 premium chatlets centered on growth, mastery, creation, and transformation.

**Building the Ecosystem: Light Points & Community**

To make the community commitment real, I designed the Light Points (LP) system – UNI AI's loyalty currency. It rewards engagement and support, giving early believers a tangible stake and a voice.

UNI AI's ecosystem is gamified. Actions earn LP, a leaderboard helps track progress, and everyone has an equal chance to build their AI legacy. Even on the free plan, LPs allow limited access to premium features, offering a taste of the full potential. UNI AI is built for viral growth, with a promise to funnel value back to the community.

**The Road Ahead & Your Invitation**

The Growth and Creation Engine is almost ready. We're putting the finishing touches on the platform.

Does this sound interesting?

**You still have a chance to become one of the 2220 Founding Members.**

**Visit** [**uniai.io**](https://uniai.io) **right now and join the waitlist.**

You'll get a notification 48 hours before the Beta v0.9 launches, allowing you to claim your unique UNI ID. The first 2220 claimers lock in Founding Member status forever; all other early joiners get the almost-as-exclusive Early Adopter status.

Come build the future of AI together with us.

Don't let AI replace your life. Let it help you 10X it.

You deserve it all...

I'll finish with some wisdom from Kendrick Lamar's ""man at the garden"":

    “Twice emotional stability
    Of sound body and tranquility, I deserve it all
    Like minds and less enemies
    Stock investments, more entities, I deserve it all
    VVS', white diamonds, GNX with the seat back, reclinin'
    Bitch, I deserve it all”

Thanks for reading this far! This journey has been intense, filled with pivots and breakthroughs, both for UNI AI and for myself. Sharing it openly feels like the right way to start building the transparent, empowering community I envision.

Im currently using a breville bambino and a breville smartgrinder pro (wich fit perfectly for me since I like a good espresso while being a casual user). I'm getting good beans from a local coffeehouse.

  
After reading a bit, it seems that it would benefit me to get myself a botomless portafilter and a IMS screen to enhance the taste of my coffee. For years I use the dual wall double basket that came with the machine.

So my questions are : Would it really benefit me to change my portafilter set-up ( Botomless and IMS screen) ? And if so, coud you guys give me link to a good bang for my bucks combo.

  
As said, I found the grind size and quantity that give good shot ( I enjoy a long espresso , half a cup at least). But i am not the kind to weight the grams or i could not tell you how many onz it gives me.

1kczmho,https://v.redd.it/ocrn76yl0dye1,Embracing AI Adapting to the Future of Work,"**How AI is slowly eating my bookkeeping job (and why I'm oddly okay with it) \[Personal Story\]**

I've been a bookkeeper for about 20 years, and I'm watching my job slowly disappear before my eyes. Thought I'd share my experience since I can't be the only one facing this.

When I started, we used dot matrix printers and JD Edwards. Had to save work to massive hard drives daily and everyone lived in fear of corrupted databases. Now? Everything's in the cloud, and AI-powered tools like Zapier have completely transformed my workflow.

What used to take me minutes per transaction now takes seconds. Customer info automatically flows from payment gateways to our CRM to our accounting software (Xero). My job is basically just checking that receipts match and clicking ""OK."" It's becoming mind-numbingly boring.

The scary part? My employer is actively seeking work for me to do. The workload has decreased so much that they're struggling to justify my position. My identity is wrapped up in this work (we spend 5 days a week doing it, how could it not be?), and the thought of being pushed out ""because I'm not needed anymore"" feels pretty shitty.

But here's the weird part - I don't entirely hate this transition. Since March 2020, I've been working 100% remotely. No more 2-hour daily commutes. No more taking half-days off for appointments. My husband and I house-sit in different locations, exploring new areas while working full-time. I absolutely love this lifestyle and don't want to give it up.

So my solution isn't fighting against AI, but adapting. I'm learning video editing, recording techniques, and software like DaVinci Resolve. I'm putting myself on Upwork and Fiverr. I'm focusing on skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.

The way I see it, we're like coffee shops in the age of Nespresso machines. Sure, people can make great coffee at home for cheaper, but they still flock to cafes for the human connection. That's what we need to focus on - the things AI can't replicate.

Anyone else in a similar boat? How are you adapting to AI in your field?

**TLDR:** AI is automating my bookkeeping job to the point where my employer struggles to find work for me. Instead of fighting it, I'm adapting by learning new skills while maintaining the remote work lifestyle I love.

**August 4**

I am grabbing things from below the counter when John pipes up.  
  
“Okay boss…  stop me if you’ve heard this one. A mermaid walks into a coffee shop and is a merman by the time they get to the counter.”  
“This a joke?”  
“Dead serious.”  His voice changes.  Work mode.  “How May I help you…good person.”  
  
I look up from the counter and a familiar androgynous creature is standing there. Her hair is shiny, blue, and beautiful.  Thin face, a bright smile that covers what I know are occasionally shark teeth, and eyes a green that screams of the ocean.  As always, I can’t look at her too long because she is too pretty. 

I also know this creature. Quite well. We joke together because we have the same nickname. “Hi Pat!  Want your usual mocha?”  Pat nods and gets a little shy.

John does a double take.  “Unfuckingbelievable.  How?”  
As John gets their drink ready, I look over. She is embarrassed and I need to fix that. “Okay, so stop feeling like that. There is no shame in this room.  Believe me, you’ve hung out with Jackie long enough.  Work with her and it vanishes…”  
Pat laughs that merry laugh, but it is a slightly different but still beautiful voice. Familiar. Like it was in the car ride. Our eyes meet.  I realize something is different.  She is not vaping, and her voice is…  is that an Adam’s apple?  *Hold up*! The look on my face must register my feelings because she looks down and begins explaining.  
“Fish in schools change gender to keep the balance. This is the first time I have been in here where the women clients outnumber the men by a fair bit…”

She, no he, they?  They are in a panic. I need to be kind to my friend. This isn’t new. Jen. I will adjust. More important is to be kind to my friend.  
“So, you switched to male to keep things as balanced as possible and everyone at ease. Why do you think you need to feel embarrassed? Also, they/them better from now on?”  
Pat looks up and smiles. I see genuine gratitude in those sea green eyes.  “Good point.  Yes to they/them. Especially since you and John are both treating me like you always do. Except John. He didn’t recognize me!”  
“I was looking at your cleavage when it just up and vanished.  Even with that happening, you merfolk are all too pretty to look at too long. Things get difficult. So, I don’t really know you from Chris or Blake.  And don’t get me started on either of the Greys.  I like hanging out with both of them, but I wouldn’t be able to tell them…”

The gasp tells me he is piecing it together. Pat and I are now enthralled.

“apart…?!?!?!  Oh… oh no.” 

Almost there…

“NO.” 

ALMOST THERE…

“Wait.”  Yep, he’s there.

“I thought… FUCK.  There is only one Grey, right?”  The finality and acceptance at his conclusion almost got a giggle out of me.  
“Oh, sweet summer child, the pleading in your voice is hilarious. Yes, there is only one Grey. They delight in waiting until the balance is different each time to come in when you are here.”  
“Boss, ban Grey from here.  I can’t imagine looking at them in the face again!”  
“You know I will not even as a joke. You will just have to be nice.  Also, Grey’s ordered the same thing every time, male or female.  You keep making comments about it and they keep hinting.”

“That’s not it.”  He looks upset.

“I didn’t get it until Pat explained the school thing.  I realized Grey and the rest were probably similar.  No shame in it.""  I feel like this should reassure him.  It does not in the least.  
“Shit, you don’t get it.  I am supposed to go to a Nicks game with Grey on Friday. I set it up with ‘male’ Grey.”  
I go over the usual demographics of those games in my head and realize why he said that. As does Pat.  
“You may have made the date with male grey, but you will have female grey on your arm.  This is worth the worry I had coming in!”  
“Rule 3!”  I chime in.

John immediately looks mortified.  “I DIDN’T THINK OF IT AS A DATE!!!”

“Grey certainly did.” We both giggle here.

“FUUUUUUUUCK”

“Calm down, this one slides.  I will ask Grey to take it easy on you.  Would you be able to help there, Pat?  Also, remember what we said at the club some months back and the most efficient way of not worrying about a man stealing your baby?  Maybe tell Grey not to eat him.  He has really good availability.”

Pat smiles.  They are laughing a quite bit and seem at ease.  John turns ashen, “Baby?  Eat me?  Hold on, what?”

I am glad Pat is no longer embarrassed by who they are at the moment.  I hope it lasts. They should be comfortable in their own skin.  No one should take that from them. “Hey Pat, you know you can be you here. Rule 5 is ‘Don’t judge.’ And it is as important as the others. Okay?  Besides, you really think I would let anyone make fun of my nickname sharing bestie?”  
  


They fist bump me.  “More than bestie. You are my sister from another mister.”  
I feel something shift. So does two-thirds the room. Pat’s eyes become huge.  “Oh.  Oh no.  Oh no no.  No no No. Nononono! I didn’t think…” 

I feel weird.  There are gasps in the room.  I stagger a bit.  
  
A chill reaches my spine as the irregular client chime sounds. Oberon walks in wearing his usual attire and immediately looks at me.  He looks surprised and afraid. He then looks straight at Pat and his rage is apparent.  “What have you done?”  
  


Several minutes of de-escalation on my part later, we are sitting at a table.  
“The point is you declared Pat your kin. IN A PLACE OF POWER.  LITERALLY THEIR PLACE OF POWER!!!  Do you have any idea what that entails?”  
“They have been blessed by the Sea?”  Pat seems to have shrunk into themselves.  
“Keep going…” Oberon is not holding back.

“They will have kinship abilities to merfolk?”

A random thought jumps in, why are they using “they” for me?

“And what are those?”  As he says this a fairly large group of women from an office somewhere come in.  I feel something change in me. I look over as Pat stares at me in horror and empathy.  
Oh… oh no…. 

Well, THAT thing's new.    
  


**August 4**

“THIS ISN’T FUNNY JACKIE!!!”  
“You are right, it’s hilarious Pat.  Dear god I have to find my dad’s VHS tapes of SNL now so I can watch the skits on Pat.”  
In my home, there are two people. Me and my best friend and employee, Jackie. She is a fiery redhead that is so very, **very** female. She is a very curvy female that is currently just in a towel because she was about to take a shower when I showed up with this situation.  A situation that means I am now a… a guy.  A guy watching her towel valiantly battle her laughing fit to stay on.  It’s losing that battle.

 I am losing a battle of my own with this thing in my pants, I am blaming that failure of a towel.  It is now my nemesis. Damn you towel. Stop struggling and… Yikes.  I need to find a way to fix this swapping thing.  Because I can’t be in this home with her like this.  
“Okay, so you had like C cups before, so is the packaging proportional to that or…”  
“Alright, one, why the hell do you know my cup size, and two, I am not showing or telling you!”  
“We do laundry together along with seeing you naked more than once. And damn it, I was hoping!”  
“That was how, not why, Jackie…”  The memories of the occasional walk ins for showers shows up along with the one time we discussed Cindy and *I wonder how any of my blood is reaching my cheeks when THAT is stealing it all. That towel could fall at any moment and I kinda want it to… How do men deal with this thing?!*”  My face and crotch betray me…  
Jackie stares at me, blushing.  
“You are salivating… and.. Um… bi awakening. Remember. You had a hand in it. Literally.   I check you out almost as much as I do Verenestra.  Shower stuff just confirms it.  Speaking of…”  She looks at the shower and then me, her eyes are like pools of water beckoning me to join her.  Her towel moves a little further down. 

Bitch is doing it on purpose, I know it.  It may fall off any second.  
My mind races through all the scenarios and the damn thing down there just got even bigger. Fuck!!!  I need an escape. She is bad enough for me without this thing between my legs encouraging us!  Especially with how she is smiling*. I think she may have the Fae beat for pure desire causing sexiness right now.*  
“Um, Jackie, don’t get any ideas.”  
“You’re straight, right?”

“Woman!”

“You have enjoyed me groping your ass and you have groped my chest...”

“Don’t…”

“And you are a guy now..”

“Don’t you dare.”

“And I am a gal…”

“DON’T YOU FUCKING DARE!”

“So why not try out that penis, for science?”

“I SAID DON’T GET ANY IDEAS!!!”

 “It’s more like a fantasy come true than an idea…”  


“You didn’t listen to me at all. Alright, this is too tempting. I am going to the small apartment above the shop. See you tomorrow.”  


“You didn’t say for whom it was too tempting…”  
*FUCK.  Right, time to leave.*  
  
“Stop!  You need to pack some clothes. Probably want some loose-fitting ones. I’ll shower while you pack so I am not in your face and the temptation thing is dealt with.”  


Sounds reasonable. I need some clothes in case this takes a while. I get a small carry bag filled and start to head out when I pass the open bathroom door.  Oh. My.  


She left the opaque shower curtain open and just the almost clear plastic one is closed. I am presented an almost perfect view of her back as she showers.  And then she turns around and looks at the doorway.  *This woman hates me.  I swear she’s a succubus!*  I run out the door before doing so gets awkward.  I swear I hear a sad “awwww come in and wash my back” as I leave.  Bitch!  
  
  
**August 7**

  
3 days. 3 fucking days. So far, I have spent most of them as a guy and I have like 9 phone numbers for my troubles.  2 are from men. It is even affecting straight men because me as female Pat has gotten 3. That’s like three times the normal rate for me as a woman normally. I am not sure if I should be complimented or insulted. This isn’t the body I feel right in and this sucks.

I get this now. Being in the body that is right for you isn’t weird. It is just what is right for you.  I never had to think of it on such a level before.  Gods above, Jan has been so fucking sweet to me.  She is a godsend.  I am so going to donate to Trans Lifeline every month from now on.  If they helped her, they absolutely deserve it.  
A new face comes in with Pat. The bell rings something strange.  Every hair on my body reacts. That is not a good sign. Jackie gasps when she sees her.  She’s probably thinking dirty thoughts.  
“Pat, I need you to meet someone. Call her Morgana.”  
My blood freezes. The only one which equals Mab and Titania in some of the tales. Mab has domain over sky, Titiana the earth, and Morgana La Fey has the seas, lakes and rivers.  
She isn’t coming as a customer. I can sense it. I bow. “Good day to you, Morgana.  I am pleased to make your acquaintance.”  
She nods. Looks over at the now female Pat and tilts her head.  
“I have been asked for a favor from this one to help you with their error.  I would ask permission to do so.”  
“Denied.”  
She shakes her head from shock as do Jackie and Pat. Their bewildered expressions would be funny if this wasn’t so dangerous for me.  
“Do explain.” Her tone is one of pure annoyance.  
“I do not know the nature of the favor you would extract from one I hold dear. A valued guest in my domain and one I call friend. Without knowing if the exchange is a fair one, I am not willing to subject them to owing such a favor to one of the greatest of the Fae. I know them, to right a wrong done to one they hold dear, they would pledge almost anything.”  
She smiles and I almost faint in terror.  
She addresses Pat.  “You told me this one was special.”  Her words are icy.  This is not good. 

“You were willing to live decades as my servant for her and this is what she does when I am to perform this favor?”  
Pat shakes with fear. I move without meaning to and am physically between them in an instant.  
Gasps from the Fae onlookers. Morgana’s eyes grow wide in surprise.

“You would stand in my way while I deal with one of my own?”

“If they are a guest, a friend, and **within a place that is mine, I WOULD.**”  I can feel the air change.  Morgana’s eyes do not show fear.  But they are in the neighborhood where that show is happening. Very close by.”  
“I see. Well, she really is special indeed.  This will not do.”

*So hot.  Look at him go.*  
She addresses me, “Child, you have the sea’s blessing. But it is incomplete and not refined. It was made within your domain without thought.”  Her smile is not what I expect. It is warm and caring.  
“You may be their, what was it?  Ah, yes.  Sister from another mister, but you are not a child of the FaeWyld.  As such this blessing has not been properly bestowed.  Let me fix that.”

She begins to glow.  “Be at ease with your blessing, deny it no longer, and may it never harm you again.  Know your own power.”  She moves fast as lightning and kisses my cheek.  
I feel a difference immediately.  What is going on?  I can see all the Fae now.  Like see THEM. Not their glamour, the real being behind the mask.  I see Pat’s gills and topaz skin.  I see Morgana. Oh, holy shit. She is glowing. Wisps of light trailing off in every direction. Hell, one of them is going to the sink?  Oh. Water.  She’s connected to every source of flowing or standing water?!?!  And so beautiful.  Her eyes, the blue of reflected sky, no whites.  *Okay, Pat, stop staring at the gorgeous goddess.*  
I look around. *Todd is an actual troll. Green scales, dagger teeth, everything. Still in those beautiful blue eyes I see my kid bro.  The Nymph, Terra, is… oh my. Maybe don’t look directly at her either.*

I look at John. His form remains itself. But I can see in his torso something glowing. It is a rock.  Granite. Steady, unmoving. Surrounded by grey waters and some mud which all flow around that core.

Lemar is similar. His form surrounds a core which for him is a windstorm. And in the center is a calm and serene lake. I swear I see a swan there. She has made her way into there, huh?

Jackie. WHAT THE EVERLIVING FUCK?!?! I don’t see her core surrounded by her body like I do with them. I see fire surrounding her and her skin shimmers with a copper sheen. Her eyes glow blue with fire. Her hair is literally flame.  It is like her core and her outer self are one.  She is a creature of fire and metal and wind. And she is absolutely fucking stunning.  Oh crap, she’s basically a Fae.  And if she is…

Now I am a little scared.  I look down at me.  
  


My skin is steel with sinews of green vines and veins of ice throughout all of it.  My nails are molten iron.  I see fire surrounding me. Green fire. It is whipped about by an invisible wind and autumn and spring leaves float around me. Cherry blossoms and maple leaves and pine needles whirl in patterns around me.   
Green light also surrounds me. I can see it connecting to every entry and corner of the building. Of my domain… Oh, I can see letters in the air above the door. Backwards. I wonder what they say and they race to me and turn so I can inspect them.  “May all who come to my place find peace, calm, happiness, and may they follow the rules!! The rules of etiquette and hospitality are absolute here.  Break them at your peril, as you risk the wrath of the Winter and Summer courts and most importantly the ruler of this domain, Pat.”  
I send it back with a flick of my fingers. The last line makes me seem on par with the Courts and that shouldn’t be. Ugh. I can’t fight any Fae that would mean me harm. What should I do about….  
A voice enters my mind.  “*Holy fucking shit balls. Look at him. I’m wetter than my first time seeing Oberon. I mean. Fuuuuuuck.*”  
  
Who the hell is thinking THAT?  And is that about me…?  
  
I look at myself in the mirror.  My shoulder length brown hair is no longer there. In its place is a mass of leaves, ice, water, and fire. It encompasses all the colors therein. It moves as if alive.  Below it my normal ordinary brown eyes are opals, the pupils a sea of stars. My features haven’t changed much, though my fingers seem to end in flames. Oh, yea, I am still a guy. Maybe if I look on my body…  
I can see what looks like the ocean within me. It is in my chest and my loins. I realize I can make it change, and I am a girl again. Wow. Awesome. Too bad I can’t make this belly pudge migrate to my chest… oh um. Wait… It did? That’s not right. That fucking worked?!

*WWWWWWHHHAAAAT?  She’s even more gorgeous.  Definitely remembering that tonight…*  
  
“WHO KEEPS BROADCASTING ALL THE LEWD?!”  My words are too loud for my voice.  I am just glad the last human that doesn’t know left the lobby minutes ago.  There are startled Fae jumping.  Even Jackie yelps.  
I turn and as I do so I give her my best “knock it off asshole” glare.  She knows better than to be scared of me.  Yelping.  Yeesh.  3 nearby Fae cower. One of them is probably the source.  The Nymph that always flirts with me?  Probably.  Oh. Yea, don’t look at her too long…

Jackie looks at me, smiles, raises her hand and does her “you bet, I am totally going to do better now” thumbs up with the smile that makes me laugh. Ugh. That woman.  
I turn to Morgana.  She has a look that might be … concern(?) on her face.  
“How do I turn this off, good lady?”  
She smiles. “You must focus your will.  Tell your senses and, most importantly, your power to return to what your mortal being is used to.”

Okay. So, powers calm down? 

WOW THAT WORKED!!!  Light is normal, I look normal in the mirror though my bra is off a bit and tight as hell. Glad I decided to put it on in case of switches, not professional to go without.  Need to adjust it tho.  Hold on, the cup size is too small now…Oh crap, was that a permanent change?  The flat belly is nice. I really should be working out…. FOCUS PAT! Talk to Morgana!  
  
“My lady, I am unsure how to address what you have done.”  *I denied her favor to Pat and yet she did it anyway.  Does it count as a favor to me?  One I didn’t ask for?!*  
  
“Consider this merely a correction.  Sooner or later, you would have earned the blessing of the sea and lakes as you have the air and land. Pat jumped the gun, but only because Pat should have brought their feelings to my attention.  You have been kind to all my children and charges. As such, while Pat gave you a minor blessing, it still carried the weight of all their admiration for your efforts. It was in all but name, MY blessing. I fixed it and gave you a key to accessing all of it so my blessing would not be viewed as anything but a positive. You may change at will so long as you wish it. You may also find the sea unwilling to harm you. In any case, no favor was needed.”  
“So earlier, were you testing me?”  
She nods.  “I was.  You passed better than I could have imagined. Even facing me, your will was absolute. You tapped into your power as though born to it to defend Pat from me with no hesitation.  From me. One of the queens.  Believing it would likely mean your end.  And you were GLORIOUS!!!  Your eyes were afire, your gaze could burn lesser Fae and you held the full power of your domain within you. Magnificent!”  
What the fuck is she talking about?  
Morgana smiles at me and I feel like our audience is done.  And I really don’t have a say in it.  “I believe I am parched. Pat, let us have a drink together. What do you recommend?”  
Together they walk to the counter and John begins to serve them.  Jackie runs up to me.  
“Babe… you flew.”  
I am a little annoyed at the lack of professionalism but more concerned with something else.  My mind tries to process it.  “Wut?”  
“You literally flew. Well, first you saw her turn on Pat and you just… appeared between them. You literally weren’t in the space in between.  Just pop and there.  And you weren’t touching the ground. You were hovering like half a foot up. You didn’t notice how much you towered over her?  Oh and there were green and almost white flames around you. And you were such a hottie like that. Anyway, you were on fire and your hair was CRAZY and you suddenly went back to femme fatale you. Except with some changes…  you do that on purpose?”  
My shame is immediate.  “Yea, kinda…”  
“Can you do it for me?  I would like some upgrades on the curves.”  
“Sorry, I can’t upgrade perfect.”  
*OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMGOMGOMG!!!!*  
“Who the hell keeps broadcasting?”  
Todd pipes up, “probably some shipper.”  
“What the fuck do you mean Todd?”  The asshole just laughs and waves the question away.

  
“Anyway, even if I could change you, I wouldn’t want you to change.  Now, YOU saw the fire and stuff?”  
“The only people that couldn’t were the people that don’t know how many of the irregulars aren’t average people, and they all left. All the enlightened, as you like to call them, could.  Right guys?”

Lemar just nods, a little dumbfounded.  I think my change scared him a little.

“Those office girls thought there was a fight or something and the staff was stepping in.  They bugged out fast.”  
“I guess this place protected me like it does them. Oh yea, Todd, your natural form is bad ass.”  
“You really think so?!”  
“No.”  I wink at him, and he starts laughing. Big sis can’t give him a full compliment, after all.  Got to maintain my Nee-chan street cred in front of Beth.

“Okay, so now that you can control when you… flip the script…. Want to…”  
“Stop right there. This ability is a thing that is special and not for a kink. It is how they live, finding their balance with that of others. I am not abusing that.” I also want to be the me that I feel is right.  
“Fair!”  She holds up her hands. And walks away. That is her saying “I was wrong, not bringing it up again.”  *She is so damn adorable.*  
She turns and smiles at me as she busses a table. It is no wonder she is dating such a cutie as Cindy. 

 **August 11**

“I need advice. Should I go with the black shirt or blue?”  Todd is looking pained, and I am not going to let that stand.

“That blue shirt kicks ass with your eyes. Go with that.  Where you two going?”

“Movies are bad. I wanted to give her something fun, Luna Park.”

Jackie walks up and leans on the counter.  She smiles. “An amusement park for a first date. Bold. I like.  When are you taking me, Pat?”

I laugh and nudge her.  “Ask Cindy to go, dork. Hell, she’s right there in the lobby, waiting for you to get off shift for your movie date. And we are talking about Todd.”  I switch my attention back to him.

“I suggest you plan on no more than 2 rides that induce motion sickness and then do less date vibe killers after that. Be sure to offer to pay for the food and absolutely listen to her ride preference.  Don’t push a girl on her first date.”

“Got it nee-chan. You are the best, wish me luck.”

As he leaves Jackie looks over at me. “You realize we are helping an actual Troll, like unseelie, do better on a date with a human girl…” her tone is pure mirth.

“Yea, and we both know he would take bullets for strangers.  If she is precious to him, she is the safest person in that park. He may be a troll and occasionally kinda an ass, but he has one of the nicest hearts I have ever met.  Hell, he’s on the safe list with May and Connie if an employee wanted to date him.”

Connie is about to come in when he stops at the door, opens it for her, and waves.  He whispers to her, and I listen in because I can’t help myself. “They really are the best, even when they think I can’t hear them.”  She laughs, winks, and nods.

I can taste the staleness of K-cups. So I have been taking my little k-cup reusable insert and some coffee from home. Some hotels don’t have those kind of coffee makers so but many do. I really hate it when I go to a hotel that has those little hot water heater type of coffee makers and their inserts with a pouch is a different size so I end up putting hot water in the cup, and dropping the pouch in like a tea bag. (Former Marine so I will find a way lol) Sometimes on short trips I rough it for a day or two, and found some nice instant coffee brands so I just need hot water. Back around Christmas 2024 I started seeing ads and articles for different single cup makers and this one kept sticking out. I watched videos, found this group, and joined it, but didn’t pull the trigger. About a month ago I received my AeroPress Original. It fits in my backpack perfectly. Easy to use and easy to clean. Again, I take coffee from home (I have an adjustable burr grinder) so all I need  is hot water and a cup. This whole week I had to work in California. I ordered and had a flow control cap delivered to my hotel. I did not bring coffee, I just went to a local store known for not selling ANY unhealthy items. I grabbed some small quantities of different kinds of beans they have in hoppers and ground them at the store. One I really liked, the other roast was a little meh, so I didn’t get stuck with a pound of something I didn’t care for. Basically, all week I have enjoyed some of the best coffee I have had on the road in the past 4 years!! Without the k-cup staleness from hotel pods, without the lack of flavor you lose from reusable k-cups (something misses in that brewing method, water passes through too quickly 🤷🏻‍♂️). And without having to clean up, throw on regular clothes and shoes and get coffee from the lobby that may have been there all night 🤨. I need to get the XL model for home. This is really a game changer (for me). Some of my friends call me a coffee snob, I used to say I wasn’t but after this week I am thinking they might be right 😂.",14,1746188488.0,AeroPress,6,0.95,False

I leave my house at 8am and get home at 10pm. With the responsibilities for dinner and other household things, I have no time to revise during the week and the weekends become so hectic trying to cram everything in. I don't get a second of downtime which is taking a huge toll on my mental health.

From some advise, I've tried to take a 10/15 minute walk in the afternoon - and thats only if i'm not feeling guilty for my time not revising. I really want to take some time to have a coffee or a sweet treat to take my mind off everything, but I'm strapped with cash. 

I feel like I deserve this break and it would really be motivating if you could support me for one once a week. Theres about 5 weeks for my exam - so just 5 coffees would actually make my day and help me to take the time for myself that I desperately need.

Ok, I (20f) am part of a group of four friends. We tell each other everything and have known each other for 6 years or so. Our friend D (22f) dated a guy from our high school who'd had a crush on her for a while, and the entire time they were dating last year (approximately 3 months), she was complaining to us that he was really unattractive to her and she was just giving him a chance because he's a good guy, funny, and smart (and free meals don't hurt!). We all told her that it would be best to be honest and stop taking advantage of a guy who has liked her from the moment they met, stop stringing him along, and cut off contact because we thought it was really selfish of her. She kept up the relationship, behaving super lovey-dovey when no one was around them but as soon as we would all hang out, she be aloof, etc. They break up eventually because she couldn't find him attractive but of course she still can't be honest and gives him some sob story about them not being meant for each other, blah blah blah. I got really excited to hear that they broke up because I had been crushing on him (B 23m) hard before they ever went out. But I wasnt sure how he felt about me, and we all saw how crushed he was by the breakup, especially according to D's account of it and her big show she's put on. Every time us girls would hang out she made a huge spectacle of ""texting"" B and going on and on about how much he ""missed"" her and was trying to ""win her back"". All of us felt how wrong it was for her to continue communicating with him if he truly felt this way because he's such a great guy and she'd made it crystal clear (at least to us!) that she thought he was ugly and not worth her time. Fast forward to almost a year later, and I get a call from this guy B. (In a small town, we'd begun working in the same company) He starts talking about his day/life, asking me questions to get to know me better, and I start opening up to him in a way I never had with another man. He asks me when we can meet for a date and we decide four days later. The very next day I rush to meet D before work for coffee to tell her about the call and make sure there's no hard feelings if I do date him. I even told her I ""would not go on a single date with him if I knew it would ruin our friendship"". She told me she wasn't attracted to him and to go for it. But as I'm about to leave she gives me a hard stare and says real cryptically ""Don't hurt him."" And then basically dismissed me. I had no mixed signals from her until that, but I had told her to stop me if it was a problem and she still had 3 days. But not a word from her about it and we all hung out the following day, by then everyone knew about the date coming up and nothing negative was said. Our date was fantastic, we had a lot of fun getting to know each other more, and nobody brought up D so I figured everything with that was finally over for B. I mean, he must've moved on right? Well, we got really serious really quickly. We're very compatible and share a ton of similar interests and backgrounds, and we both fell hard. Within four months we were in love and talking about marriage and what our future together might look like. At work (different departments) everyone can see how smitten we are but we keep it professional, even with all the teasing going on, especially from our boss. Around our five month mark, things start happening. D decides to ""gift"" back to B everything he'd given her during their 3 month relationship (birthday present, his jacket, etc) right in front of me in a dramatic show-and-tell, starts making comments within our friend group constantly reminding me that he dated her first or pointing out any similarities D and I may share as ""the only reason"" he likes me. I find it annoying but also childish and don't play along. We gloss over her passive aggressive behavior and move on. Now, us four girls being friends since junior high, we know each others families to an extent. At this point I've been dating B for almost a year. I'm at a party with our friends and some of D's family when her big brother introduces me to their cousin by saying,""this is OP, D's WORST nightmare!"" Which shocked me and I immediately ask why he'd say that to someone I'm meeting for the first time. He looks shocked at his comment and my cluelessness and tried to brush it off, but by then I had a feeling that D must've been saying things behind my back. I don't want to ask my friends because I feel if she felt a certain way about me and B dating she would've said something to my face, especially when I've done nothing but consider her feelings from the beginning and don't share much if anything that goes on between me and my boyfriend. I just feel confused that she's been so rude up to this point that it's beginning to wear on me and I'm reconsidering my friendship with someone so immature that she'd treat me like this when: a) she never was attracted to him; and b) she broke it off after only three months and felt relieved when they stopped dating because of point a) above!

What you need to do with this part of your tool kit is put the context upfront. This could be a conversation about literally anything. Let’s do a simple example of the classic educational experiment of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich if you ask the AI model, what is this experiment really doing and you have it tell you what the experiment is doing you can use that context while you continue the conversation.

Example of above:

“What’s the classical educational experiment where you write directions out for peanut jelly and butter sandwich and what is the lesson of it?”

```
Output: The experiment involves students writing step-by-step instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which a teacher then follows literally. When instructions like ""spread peanut butter on bread"" are given, the teacher might place the jar on the bread without opening it.

The lesson demonstrates:
1. The importance of clear, precise communication
2. Assumptions we make when giving instructions
3. The gap between what we think we've communicated vs. what we've actually communicated

This exercise is commonly used in programming, technical writing, and science education to teach the value of explicit instructions and the challenges of communicating procedural knowledge.
```

Given the context of the above experiment, how would one write those clear directions of setting up their own self ran chat models on ollama for experimentation?

```
Clear Directions for Setting Up Self-Hosted Chat Models with Ollama
Given the ""PB&J sandwich"" lesson about clear instructions, here's a precise guide for setting up chat models on Ollama:
Step 1: Install Ollama

Open your web browser.
Navigate to https://ollama.com/download
Download the version specific to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Double-click the downloaded file to begin installation.
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation.
Verify installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing: ollama --version

Step 2: Download a Model

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Type the following command to download a model (example with Llama 2): ollama pull llama2
Wait for the download to complete. The terminal will show download progress.

Step 3: Run the Model

In the same terminal, type: ollama run llama2
Wait for the model to load. You'll see a prompt appear.
Type your question or prompt and press Enter.
To exit the chat, type /exit or press Ctrl+C.

Step 4: Experiment with Different Models

To see available models, type: ollama list
To download another model, use: ollama pull [model-name] (e.g., ollama pull mistral)
Run the new model with: ollama run [model-name]

Step 5: Adjust Parameters (Optional)

To modify generation parameters, use: ollama run [model-name] --system ""Your system prompt here"" --temperature 0.7
Adjust temperature (0.0-1.0) to control creativity (lower is more deterministic).

Common Troubleshooting

If Ollama doesn't start, ensure the service is running with: ollama serve
If a model fails to load, check available disk space and RAM.
For GPU acceleration, verify your GPU drivers are up-to-date
```


This was just a random EZPZ example to showcase, but it’s up your wildest imagination of setting up the context. 

-context of a long conversation on how different philosophers see the world, and then with your prompt “pull” in the context with clear references to the “totality” or even “assumed sentiment of prior conversation”

- context of how a coffee artisan would view the art of their barista-ship then applying “the same methodology they would use to a {{specific_art_or_craft}}.

- Context priming chat about interpreting a piece of art image input, then asking model to interpret an engineering concept under the guide of the context.
