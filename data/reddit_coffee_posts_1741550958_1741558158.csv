I can think of a small play area in the Barbican in London, or in a coffee shop near where we live in Shropshire there is an area with a few toys for babies/toddlers.

I've seen dozens of analyses on how to save Starbucks, and I never see anyone saying what seems to be obvious: Starbucks is declining in sales because people simply have better options for coffee taste/quality than they used to. For decades they were the best coffee option for most people because the alternative was waffle house or McDonald's, neither of which even served Arabica beans; but now, with every small town having a local roaster and decent local coffee shop(s), and every podunk gas station serving Arabica bean coffee, Starbucks is average or below average compared to most available options, and not below average in price.

The vast majority of analysts seem to say that the solution is marketing or pricing that same below average coffee in different ways, or offering different food options, or changing who can sit in the lobby or not...why is the coffee quality and flavor itself never up for discussion? 

This same question goes for TGI Fridays, Applebee's, Buffalo WW, etc...why do analysts never criticize the quality of food/drink when it comes to food and beverage chains' declining sales?

I have a rule that I can't look at my phone unless I do (fill in the blank).  
My current goals are to read more and drink more water. So my new rules in the morning are ""no book, no phone"" and ""no water, no phone"". In order to look at my phone, I have to read x amount of pages or for x amount of minutes (my specific rule is 15 minutes). It's really been amazing how starting my day reading gets my brain awake for the day instead of maxing out my dopamine before 6am scrolling, and I get some uninterrupted reading and coffee-drinking-in-peace time before my kids wake. I also make sure to drink a glass of water before I look at my phone. I have a friend who will keep her book on top of her phone where she charges it. The physical boundary helps remind her.

It can look different for everyone, but it's helped me cultivate a really meaningful morning routine I look forward to that help meet some of my goals, especially with young kids. And I don't necessarily stress about ""me time"" or time spending meeting certain goals because I've made it a priority to build it into my day before everyone else is awake. All I had to do was set my alarm 15 minutes earlier. My time with my book and coffee is so precious to me and I genuinely look forward to it every single morning. And I honestly don't even look at my phone right away still most days because it's become so engrained to do the other habits first.

Other ideas could be:

stretching

exercising

cooking breakfast for yourself and/or family

meditation/prayer

creating a grocery list for the next couple of days

journaling/gratitude practice

practice an instrument

work on a crossword puzzle or sudoku puzzle

prep/chop ingredients for dinner later that evening so they're ready to go

go sit outside

skin care routine

crochet

Also! It can look different every day or specific to that day if you want to get something done. For example on Sundays: ""no grocery list, no phone"" and ""no water, no phone"" then I'll use that time to write out meals/groceries for the week before I order them for pick up. The rest of the week it's reading & water. :) Sometimes if I slept really well the night before I will just sit in the living room and ask Alexa to play my favorite music...sit and enjoy it because I want to, knowing my kids won't yell at me to play something else hahaha

the past few days i feel that i can not fully empty myself i guess. the only change that i've recently made was taking a b12 supplement in hopes of helping some fatigue ive been experiencing. i stopped taking the supplement, assuming it was that. i know it may take some time to resolve but ive now tried stool softeners and a saline laxative. while i do end up pooping, it takes a long time. 

i know not to strain and hurt myself, so it's usually just me sitting there for 30-an hour at longest to poop what usually takes me about a 5-10 minute bathroom break on a normal day. im just concerned that what im taking isn't causing a more dramatic effect. is there any reason i would still feel the need to poop after pooping twice this morning? the first was more liquidy i assume from the laxative, the second a little less. but i still feel pressure and the urge to go to the bathroom.

I have a lactulose breath test result that indicates IMO (see test result table).

My main symptoms are:

* a lot of gas building up that I can easily get rid of, but it is still very uncomfortable if you have to fart every 5 minutes for hours if you ate the wrong food
* my poop is very fragmented and almost never comes out as a ""sausage"" in one part

  
I was a heavy coffee drinker for the last 15 years and I finally stopped 2 weeks ago. The first day after I stopped I had a solid sausage poop even though from that food I would normaly not get it. 

Next day I was at a birthday and I ate 3 pieces of cake after the main meal. Had to poop at the party but also that was a one go sausage for some reason. I continued eating foods that would normally come out very fragmented, but I always had easy bowel movements that were a solid sausage. This continued until 5 days had passed, then I was back at my normal fragmented poop.

So now I am contemplating if a lot of my issues are actually related to my subconcious nervous system activity, because I think I put my body in some kind of imbalance during the withdrawal phase and the digestion started to work a lot better for the first days. I was very tired from the withdrawals and I even had an erotic dream the first day of withdrawals, which is something I did not have in the past 10 years for sure. I am planning on finally visiting a psychologist, maybe I can get some imrovements there.

I dont bring anything to this for him to just be okay like that if anything happens. In the moment I didnt know what to say, i looked up at him holding back my tears and he immediately tried to retract it ""i didn't mean it like that"" but honestly theres no other way to mean it Though? He tried to hug on me  an i hugged back but started tickling him an clowning on him about it ""oh yeah ud be fine without me"" "" that's good to know ud be just fine if anything happened"" like playfully i made it into a joke kind of but my heart hurts I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.",3,1741555146.0,venting,2,1.0,False

1j7hs2d,https://i.redd.it/bsqz0201cqne1.jpeg,How to Find Winning Products for Your E-Commerce Business (Reverse Engineering Method),"How to Find Winning Products for Your E-Commerce Business (Reverse Engineering Method)

One of the most crucial steps in building a successful e-commerce business is selecting the right products. While many people struggle with this, the reality is that product selection can be simplified using a strategic, reverse-engineering approach. In this post, I’ll break down exactly how to identify home-run products that sell consistently, using psychology, market trends, and data-driven insights.

Who Are the Best Buyers?

Understanding your ideal customer is key to selecting the right product. Here’s who you should target:
	•	Women – They control household spending, frequently purchase gifts, and are more engaged buyers.
	•	Baby Boomers – With 97 million individuals in this demographic, they have disposable income and purchase items related to anti-aging, home décor, and convenience.

What Do People Buy?

People spend money on products that fulfill their deep-rooted desires. Some key motivators include:
	•	Love & Relationships – Items that enhance social connections, dating, or intimacy.
	•	Social Status & Confidence – Fashion, beauty, fitness, and self-improvement products.
	•	Wealth & Financial Growth – Business, investing, and money-making tools.
	•	Entertainment & Leisure – Niche hobbies, gaming, and pop culture trends.
	•	Self-Actualization – Mindfulness, personal development, and wellness products.

How to Find a Profitable Niche

The best niches are evergreen, meaning they have long-term demand. Some top-performing niches include:
	•	Fitness & Weight Loss
	•	Self-Improvement & Mental Health
	•	Home Décor & Organization
	•	High-Quality Jewelry & Accessories
	•	Pet Products
	•	Tech Gadgets & Accessories
	•	Health & Beauty (anti-aging, skincare, hair loss solutions)
	•	Unique Hobby Products (fishing, golf, cycling, yoga)
	•	Coffee & Specialty Drinks

Key Product Selection Criteria

When evaluating a product, ask yourself:
✅ Is it easily available from a supplier?
✅ Is there consistent demand?
✅ Are people willing to pay a high margin? (Aim for 50% profit)
✅ Does it have low competition on big retail sites like Walmart?
✅ Is it lightweight (preferably under 2kg)?
✅ Does it trigger an emotional response or solve a problem?

Avoid These Mistakes!

❌ Selling commodities like toothbrushes or paper towels.
❌ Picking products with razor-thin margins.
❌ Ignoring branding potential—always think long-term!
❌ Selling fragile items like glass or complex electronics (high return rates).

Pro Tip: Leverage Data to Spot Trends

To find winning products, use these research tools:
	•	Google Keyword Planner – Identify high-search-volume niches.
	•	Pinterest & Instagram – Discover trending aesthetics and viral products.
	•	Amazon Best Sellers & Aliexpress Sales Data – See what’s selling in real-time.
	•	Kickstarter & Indiegogo – Spot future trends before they go mainstream.
	•	MyIP.ms & Shopify Store Insights – Analyze the traffic of successful e-commerce stores.

By combining these strategies, you’ll be able to reverse-engineer success and find high-demand, profitable products. Stay ahead of trends, validate your ideas with data, and always prioritize quality and branding over short-term wins.

1j7hpm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1j7hpm0/13_sorce_sample_reviews_from_a_perfume_newbie/,13 Sorce Sample Reviews from a Perfume Newbie,"Hello all! It seems there are no shortage of these as of late, but I will also be joining the Sorce review train! 

My roommate and I both decided to finally try out Sorce after hearing the nonstop praise about them and their scents, and we tried quite a few samples out. I know I would have found it helpful to find more ratings on individual scents I was interested in when deciding what samples to purchase first, so I hope these reviews might be useful to some of y'all! I will warn that I am not too experienced in the world of perfume quite yet though, so some of these reviews might not be all too descriptive. 

Obligatory PSA: I only rested these perfumes (Me and my roommate got oils for all of the following samples) for like a day before testing them, so it’s possible they might change up on me a little bit again when I retest in a few days. TBD. 

My ratings are also quite subjective; I thought all of these perfumes smelled really nice, but some of the ones I gave lower ratings to were just because I am not personally fond of the notes. Overall, all of these perfumes were beautifully crafted and blended, IMO. 

**A Love Story Discovery Set**

*Ended up landing on this set since all of the perfumes sound gorgeous and it was more cost effective!*

**Chapter 1: Desire**

**This is Not a Love Spell**: violet, blueberry jam, creeping ivy, lavender, star anise, vanilla **\******aromatic fruity violet***

I enjoy this one! However, I find that my nose has a bit of a difficult time differentiating the notes (which my roommate also agreed on). Smells like a fruity vanilla, and out of the bottle there’s a little “oomph,” when I inhale?? It might be the star anise? Idk, but it’s nice! On my skin I get mostly a sweet, fruity vanilla, both on application and dry down. I like it, but I do wish it was more distinctly blueberry. I would overall rate this a **7/10.**

**Chapter 2: New Love**

**Match Made in Heaven:** matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood ***\*slightly floral gourmand***

My roommate purchased this one so I haven’t gotten the chance to personally test it on my skin, but it smells really nice out of the bottle. It smells like a sweet matcha; no grassy odor, which me and the roomie are both fond of. It’s very well blended, a very pleasant and non-offensive gourmand, and according to her, it has good throw and longevity. Based on her feedback, she’d probably rate it **10/10.** My roommate plans to FS this. 

**Chapter 3: Connection**

**The Lovers**: bergamot, iris, jasmine sambac, bamboo, vetiver, green banana, mysore sandalwood, animalic amber **\******fresh floral amber***

A really nice floral overall! I’m not the most educated on differentiating between different types of flower notes, but I can say that whatever is going on here is pleasant. Something, perhaps the green banana, gives it a nice sweetness that complements the florals nicely. It sort of just smells like how I imagine the color green would smell, if that makes sense? Overall, I’d also rate this a **7/10**. It’s good, but just not my thing, necessarily. I plan on testing it again once it settles a bit more to see how the scent evolves. 

**Chapter 4: Pleasure**

**A Sign Painted ‘Peaches’**: peach nectar, sun-warmed peach skin, saffron, gardenia, ambergris, vanilla absolute, vetiver **\******sweet solar fruit***

Ok yum. The peach smell is very apparent from the bottle, although I will say there is a sort of chemical and artificial smell as well; my roommate said it smelled almost like acetone? However, on the skin this doesn’t seem to be an issue, thankfully! My roommate’s skin really brought out the peach smell, and it sort of smelled like peach ring candy on her skin. Unfortunately, my skin sort of just… eats the fruit smells up??? On drydown, this smelled very similar to *This Is Not a Love Spell* on my skin, but I did think the peach was at least a little more distinct compared to the blueberry notes in the other one. A solid **8/10** in my book.

**Chapter 5: Obsession**

**Venus in Fleurs**: ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absolute **\******sweet atmospheric floral***

I remember reading reviews about this perfume before ordering, and I have to say I understand quite well where people were coming from. It does give Florida, to be honest; humid, with a nice green, plant-like smell and some sweetness coming from the vanilla and mango. It reminds me a little of when I would go to botanical gardens as a child, and in greenhouses filled with butterflies, plates of fruit would hang sporadically from the ceiling, filling the damp air with a hint of sweetness. **8/10** on this one as well, although much like the other two fruit perfumes so far, my skin sort of ate this one up too :((( so I will let it rest for a few days and then try it again.

**Chapter 6: Longing**

**The Things Unsaid:** spring rain, pink pepper, saucer magnolia, peony, raspberry, cotton, cedar ***on\*aquatic floral***

Omfg. omfg. I was not expecting to like this perfume as much as some of the others I ordered based on the notes alone, but it’s so beautiful? I’m sometimes wary of aquatics because they are very hit or miss with my skin, but the spring rain note of this perfume is fantastic. The florals are also blended beautifully, and the peony and magnolia are incorporated so smoothly into the rest of the perfume, along with the cotton smell. To me, this perfume is a sort of clean, nostalgic scent; the smell of clean bed sheets straight out of the dryer, and as you snuggle underneath them after taking a warm shower, you sit and watch the rain outside from your bedroom window. **10/10,** I plan to FS this. Wow. 

**Chapter 7: Rediscovery**

**Dark Skies**: desert sage, agave, tuberose, saguaro, sandalwood, vanilla **\******sweet*** ***aromatic floral***

My least favorite of the set tbh, but I think all of the perfumes are fantastic overall, so still a good scent, just not for me! I’d say it fits the theme it's based upon quite well; if *Venus in Fleurs* smells like a damp greenhouse, this smells like a dry, desert greenhouse. I’m reminded of when I had to visit a greenhouse at my university for a biology project, and the room with the cacti reminded me of this scent a bit. The desert plant smell is REALLY potent out of the bottle and when it’s still wet on my skin, but after drying for around 30 minutes or so, I found that these scents mostly dissipated, and I was left with a nice, sweet vanilla. I’d give this **5/10** overall; like I said, not a bad scent by any means, just not one that I’m personally a fan of. 

**General Catalog Scents:** 

Onto the other scents I purchased! 

**Fuckery:** Luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, clean sheets ***\*fruity, spiced amber***

Got this perfume primarily because my roommate insisted it would be hot on me (lol). Again, I understand the hype; this one far has the strongest throw and longevity of the ones I got, and the smell also remained quite consistent for me over time. For both me and my roommate's skin, the cherry smell is very strong, but not in an overpowering way; it smells sort of like those dessert cherries you’d get on top of an ice cream cone, but the sandalwood and tobacco add in a nice, mature layer to it. I give this one overall a **6.5/10;** while I do enjoy the perfume and think it’s blended together really nicely, it was a little strong for me, and not something I’d see myself wearing on a regular basis, although I will be holding onto my sample to use for more special occasions. 

**Snow Moon Magic:** Our best-selling Moon Magic gets extra cozy for winter with the addition of fluffy marshmallow, a house tincture of Tahitian vanilla beans, and gooey cookie butter ***\*true gourmand***

Yet another one I completely understand the hype for. The chai spice smell is very pleasant and not too overpowering, and the addition of the cookie butter is fantastic. I am a cookie butter fanatic myself, and found that the way this perfume smells is very similar to how cookie butter smells IRL. I was a little iffy on how the different scents would clash, but it’s really nice, especially for those who like gourmands. This was also another scent my roommate purchased, so I have only tried it sparingly, but I have liked it so far. The only criticism is that the throw isn’t very strong, and you have to get pretty close to the area of application to smell it. My roommate is planning on purchasing an alcohol based sample for this at some point in hopes that the throw is a little stronger. Will let it age for a little longer and test again, but current consensus is about a **9/10.** This may be a contender for a FS. 

**The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake:** Warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom; vanilla bean ice cream, Mysore sandalwood, Australian sandalwood ***\*spiced woody gourmand***

This was actually a freebie! It seems this scent is quite beloved, so it was really fun to find it in my order. I think I’m just a big fan of Sorce’s gourmands in general, and this is no exception. It smells pretty much exactly like how you’d imagine from the notes, and the spices are not overpowering at all. I don’t detect the peach as well, but I do get the cake and ginger/cinnamon quite well, with the added sweetness from the vanilla ice cream. My roommate said she really liked how it smelled on me, but for some reason something about it sort of messes with my nose??? I’m not even sure what exactly I’m detecting, but for some reason I felt it went a little bit funky on me :( but I am also quite tired while testing these out and the other scents might be interfering with my smell a bit so I will probably retest a little later. For now, giving this a solid **6.5/10** with the potential to increase after a bit of rest (for both the perfume and my nose).

**Cabanilla:**  Salted vanilla, sand, palm fronds, driftwood, a cracked coconut, brown sugar, balsam of Peru, and a distant beach bonfire ***\*vanilla musk***

Simple and straightforward; I am quite a fan. I was recommended this earlier as a nice, summer-y vanilla. The coconut and vanilla pair really nicely together for a very nice, pleasant scent. It reminds me a little of my coconut shampoo that I use, though; I like the way it smells, but I think the coconut is a bit more overpowering compared to the vanilla, so this is another I want to rest a little more in hopes the vanilla will become more apparent with time. **8.5/10** for now; this is on my list as a potential contender for a FS if the vanilla springs up a bit more later on!

**The Bees:** Honey extract, myrrh, Egyptian jasmine absolute, pollen, iris, mimosa absolute, fresh cream, cedar, petrichor **\*aromatic floral** (slightly sweet)

Okay damn. I know this perfume is supposed to smell like honey, but I was not entirely prepared for the extremely photo-realistic honey smell that came straight out of the bottle. This perfume is VERY honey; I think I’d get almost the exact same smell if I took a whiff straight from a bottle of real honey. If you really like the smell of honey, this is a perfect perfume for you! I found the honey smell was also very forward on my skin as well, with the more floral notes a little more obscured. They did peak out a little bit on dry-off and the longer I wore it (30+ minutes after application), but I still primarily get honey. **6.5/10** since this perfume was almost *too* honey for me, and I was hoping to smell some of the other notes more, but like I said, if you really enjoy the smell of honey, this perfume is gorgeous; one of my friends who is fond of honey really enjoyed this one, so definitely give it a shot!

**2 AM in Lafayette:** Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar **\******earthy gourmand***

Last, but certainly not least, and *holy shit.* I think I’m in love. The notes sounded beautifully edible, but I was concerned for how they’d go on my skin. In theory, this perfume sounded scrumptious; I love vanilla and milky scents, and the addition of a coffee layer and caramel sounded very enticing, but I’ve had issues in the past with coffee notes going sour on my skin. This, though? No issues at all. I’m so happy with how this perfume goes with my skin chemistry; out of the bottle, the beignet smell is very apparent. On my skin, though, a sort of burnt-sugar smell emerged that I did not smell in the bottle, but not in a bad way; to me, it smells like if you were to blowtorch sugar on a creme brulee. In addition to this, I got a subtle whiff of coffee in the background, with a nice, milky vanilla. As I wore it throughout the day, the caramelized sugar smell slowly transitioned into a more sweet, baked good sort of smell. By far my favorite of the batch, and I will absolutely FS this perfume. **11/10** I am so thrilled that Sorce’s gourmands work with my skin. 

  
Anyway!!! Those are my current Sorce purchases and reviews. Like I said earlier, I am so so impressed with this house, and I totally understand why people are obsessed with them. Even the perfumes I wasn't super fond of smelled really nice overall, and I'm excited to try some more samples. A few others I am interested in trying (if anyone has their own personal reviews on these and can offer input) are:

\- Moon Magic (we actually ordered a sample of this one and it seems like it was accidentally left out of our order :((( but it sounds yummy and I hope that we can get our hands on this one to try)

\- Falling Stars (Any of the coffee bases tbh, the samples only have salted vanilla now but all the bases sounded unique and yummy)

\-Strings of Light in the Forest

\- The Cookie Party

The first car, the S5 is mine I just got, & just started working on as well, with adding more carbon fiber in the interior, a carbon fiber spoiler, I.E cold air intake, & a few other mods, only had it a week, only so much I can do, regardless how excited & impatient my son & I are to finish it. Lol

Next up is rims, a 12"" sub, LED ambient interior lighting, I.E or Jakal Stage 1 tune, AWE Touring Exhaust, updated MMI screen, carbon fiber steering wheel, & hopefully hood, & some H & R springs, & spacers to have it sitting right. 

I've owned a lot of cool, fast & unique cars, but NOTHING like this, especially the B8/B8.5 is the last true driver's focused Audi with buttons,& switches, & an analog feel, & they really didn't miss with ANYTHING on this car, besides an alarm, but they're not legal to be installed in Germany for some reason, so don't do it for the rest of the world too.... 😂 

We have a lot of car meets here in Reno & N. Cali, so I'll try to post as many cool V.A.G cars I see, & even Ducati's as well since they're fam too & deserve the respect, I'm also a big 2 wheel fanatic as well, but now more modified high speed e-Bikes, that instant torque at whim is addicting!

# Here are the top 5 most upvoted posts for February 2025 💖



1. [Public libraries are underrated. What benefits does your local library offer that not everyone may know?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AussieFrugal/comments/1ivdw1i/public_libraries_are_underrated_what_benefits/)

Surprisingly, this post is the top most upvoted post for the month (especially since it’s my post lol). Very interesting to see the different benefits at other public libraries offer! I didn’t even know that some libraries even offer a seed library. However one mystery question remains, as this user has asked:

>I discovered a week ago that my local library has a seed library. Borrow the seeds to grow, let one run to seed at the end of the growing season, collect the seeds and return it to the library in the little packet provided.

>I don't know what happens if you try to grow something and it fails though lol. Do you get overdue fees?

 

2. [Australians and Brits don’t know how to make instant coffee correctly. Here’s how to make a good coffee for cents per serve with no upfront cost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AussieFrugal/comments/1iqk0ai/australians_and_brits_dont_know_how_to_make/)

Well well, this one did get a lot of users talking. I commend and thank the user for sharing their own frugal tip on making a good coffee. What’s your tip on making a good coffee?

 

3. [Unique hacks to save $?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AussieFrugal/comments/1infh0v/unique_hacks_to_save/),

This post had many users sharing their unique hacks. The top most upvoted comment is below, however I encourage everyone to read the post because there are so many great tips! Thank you to everyone who shared :)

>Shopping centre food courts reduce meals in the late afternoon - you can often get plenty of food for dinners/lunches much cheaper than regular takeaway.



4. [Lucky day!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AussieFrugal/comments/1ilzsmv/lucky_day/),

This user happened to stumble upon super-reduced food at supermarkets and they got a great haul of highly discounted good! Very nice

Sometimes it’s worth taking extra time to browse at the grocery store… depending on the timing, you may find clearance sales for items that you like\~

 

5. [So all you have is $20 for a week](https://www.reddit.com/r/AussieFrugal/comments/1ixfcic/so_all_you_have_is_20_for_a_week/), 

As per the title, if you had $20 for a week, what can you get to get through the week? This user (also the top commentor) gave detailed and great guide on keep their budget while making delicious healthy food. Thank you for sharing!

>Do you have oils and spices? Assuming yes:

>900g oats, 600ml of milk, 500g pasta, 375g dried black beans and lentils, 2x tins of chopped tomatoes, 1 kg flour, 1 kg white rice, 500g frozen mixed veggies, two onions, one head of garlic/jar of minced garlic (whichever is cheaper), a small piece of fresh ginger. Online that comes to $20.10 at Coles.

>With that you can do oatmeal for breakfast and then make three lunch/dinner options: veg curry, mexican beans and rice, and a veggie soup. You can make some flatbreads to have with the curry or taco style flatbreads to go with the mexican beans. If you have yeast ($2.80) and some sugar ($1.95) or honey, you can make all sorts of bread. If you need to buy two cheap spice packets, I'd choose whatever is on sale in the indianish/mexicanish style - just something to add flavour.

# Health insurance premiums increasing AGAIN!???? 😱

[Bad news Frugalities, health insurance premiums are going to increase on April 1!](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-26/private-health-insurance-goes-up/104987048) When will it stop??? 😭

This is a good opportunity to review your current health insurance plan and find a better deal!

If you are looking for the latest deals on health insurance, such as bonus points and/or free weeks, many bargain hunters on OzBargain (https://www.ozbargain.com.au/tag/health-insurance) posts the latest deals! If you’re already set on specific health insurances, regularly check their website for offers.

Some examples of websites to compare different private insurance includes [privatehealth.gov.au](http://privatehealth.gov.au) and [CHOICE](https://www.choice.com.au/money/insurance/health/compare).

If you are unsure what health insurance does, [privatehealth.gov.au](http://privatehealth.gov.au) provides a great summary on how health insurance works and how it relates to Government Surcharges and Incentives (https://www.privatehealth.gov.au/health\_insurance/surcharges\_incentives/index.htm)

Besides regularly switching providers, what other tips do you know on saving on health insurance?

1j7hkbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1j7hkbk/mystery_illness/,Mystery Illness,"So I’ve had RUQ pain for nearly the past year. I’m at a loss and so is my doc. I normally don’t ask the masses for ideas but I’m so lost. Listed below are my symptoms and things we’ve ruled out. If you have any ideas, please comment below. 

I’m a male in his mid 20’s



SYMPTOMS
 
- RUQ pain that will sometimes radiate to the back

- Popping sensation when hunched over, when stomach relaxed or extended

- Sometimes feels like it’s in my stomach or near my stomach. 

- Feels swollen all the time in RUQ like something there 

- Feels like it’s in a small spot that will radiate out to a larger area

- The pain is approx 1 inch below my rib cage and approx 3 inches to the right from my point of view

- Pain goes up into face when bad and/ shoulder and back at night or with headache

- Pain in back of throat

- Coffee makes it worse 

- If I consume small amounts of alcohol (drink maybe a glass of wine once a month), that night it hurts and the next day. 

- Empty stomach makes it worse 

- Running at high intensity makes it worse

- If I press on it, it feels almost as if it in the back of my throat and hurts 

- Sometimes back will spasm directly behind the pain but could be unrelated 

- Morning after steak dinner and rice with butter, side started hurting which then radiated to the central area. Felt like bad gas pain. Hurt pretty good





THINGS WE’VE RULED OUT AND DONE (in order from oldest to most recent)

- RUQ ultrasound which was normal (to include pancreas, liver, right kidney, bile ducts, and gallbladder)

- Comprehensive metabolic panel which has been normal (except high bilirubin once a year ago)

- HIDA scan which showed 95% EF and discomfort on CCK injection

- (not acid reflux) PPI (Prilosec and Pepcid) have done nothing and been on for a long time

- (No ulcers) H. Pylori fecal test which was negative 

- Cholysystectomy (for hyperactive gallbladder which was chronically inflamed on pathology) which did not help pain

- Hyoscamine (levsin for IBS) did not help

- Bland diet does help after few days 

- Endoscopy found nothing. No ulcers or inflammation or anything.

Was speaking with a few people, including a coffee repairman, and I get the sense that upgrading the grinder could have a significant impact on the espresso I'm producing. Doesn't seem like the Fausto is well regarded - it was my first nice grinder and machine setup (I use the ECM Mecanika Profi IV.)

I am a male, age 26

I wanna start off by saying that I used to love drinking monster energy drinks, I had a period of 2 years where I drank 1-2 pr day, and I wish I never did, because I had the scariest experience of my life, I thought I was gonna die, but basically one day in june 2023 i drank my monster as usual, and Boom, all of a sudden my heart started Racing out of nowhere, going 190 beats pr minut, and I was rushed to the hospital where they treated my condition as fast as possible.

I have not drinken any energy drink since then and Will never drink one again,

But at New Year’s Eve 2025 I had abit to drink, and it triggered some old fears and anxiety and it is something I am dealing with til this day wishing I never drank the monster energy drink.

Fast forward till today I still live with the trauma and fear of my heart going that fast again, and I have come to the conclusion that I need to stay away from alcohol and energy drinks and smoking for the rest of my life.

Everytime i walk past the monster energy drink in the local shop, I just get reminded by the bad experience I had.

I hope my story could make someone stop drinking energy drink, and just use normal coffee or a banana to use as a pre workout before the gym or just in general drink a Pepsi Max or something just stay away from that thing I wish I never touched in my life.

I will regret it for the rest of my life.",5,1741553871.0,energydrinks,4,0.78,False

I’m unsure when it went missing, and have been retracing my steps ever since. I have called doctors offices, gyms, restaurants, coffee shops, pretty much every place that I’ve gone over the last month and have gotten nowhere. The only place that I can think of where I may have left it would be at one of the 5life climbing gyms across the city. I’ve gone back to each one and asked around and dug through their lost and founds, but with no luck. 

If anyone has any info, or has recovered it, please DM me. It is a size medium and the sleeves have been shortened, so there is additional stitching at the cuff. If you zoom into the photo above, you can see what I’m talking about.

## Getting Started: How to Use Reusable Nespresso Pods

Using reusable Nespresso pods is a straightforward process, but following these steps will ensure optimal results:

1.  **Choose Your Coffee:** Select your favorite coffee beans and grind them to a fine or espresso-specific consistency.The grind size is crucial for achieving a good extraction.A grind that is too coarse will result in a weak, watery espresso, while a grind that is too fine can clog the pod and produce a bitter, over-extracted shot.
2.  **Fill the Pod:** Use a coffee scoop or a Nespresso pod filling tool to fill the reusable pod with ground coffee. Avoid overfilling, as this can prevent the machine from closing properly or lead to a weak extraction. Most pods have a fill line to guide you.
3.  **Tamp Lightly (If Applicable):** Some reusable pods benefit from lightly tamping the coffee grounds to ensure even distribution and proper extraction. However, avoid tamping too firmly, as this can make it tough for the water to flow through the coffee.
4.  **Close or Seal the Pod:** If your pod requires a foil lid, apply it carefully, ensuring a tight seal. For “lid-free” pods, simply close the lid or secure the top according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5.**Insert into Machine:** Insert the filled pod into your Nespresso machine as you would a regular capsule.6.  **Brew Your Espresso:** Start the brewing process. Monitor the extraction to ensure it's flowing smoothly and evenly.
7.  **Clean the Pod:** After brewing,remove the pod and discard the used coffee grounds. Rinse the pod thoroughly with water.For stainless steel pods, they are generally dishwasher safe. For plastic pods, check the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning recommendations. Proper cleaning is essential for maintaining the pod's performance and preventing the buildup of coffee oils.

## Tips for Optimal Espresso Extraction with Reusable Pods

Achieving a perfect espresso with reusable Nespresso pods requires some experimentation and fine-tuning. Here are some key tips to help you get the best results:

*   **Grind Size matters:** Experiment with different grind sizes to find the sweet spot for your preferred coffee. Start with a fine espresso grind and adjust as needed.
*   **Coffee Quality is Key:** Choose high-quality, freshly roasted coffee beans for the best flavor.*   **Tamping Technique:** If tamping is required, practice your technique to achieve a consistent and even tamp, if the pod requires it..
*   **Water Quality:** Use filtered water for brewing to improve the taste of your espresso.
*   **Preheating:** Consider preheating the pod with hot water before brewing to improve temperature stability.
*   **Experimentation:** Don't be afraid to experiment with different coffee types, grind sizes, and tamping pressures to find your perfect cup. Keep notes on your experiments so you can replicate your triumphant results. The right amount of coffee and compaction may vary based on the individual pod.

## Addressing common Concerns and Drawbacks of Reusable Nespresso Pods

While reusable Nespresso pods offer numerous benefits, it's crucial to acknowledge potential drawbacks and address common concerns:

*   **Learning Curve:** Requires some initial experimentation to find the right grind size and tamping technique.
*   **Maintenance:** Requires regular cleaning to prevent clogging and maintain performance. Reusable pods need to be cleaned after each use, unlike the dispose-and-go nature of single use capsules.
*   **potential for Leaks:** some users may experience leaks if the pod is not properly sealed or filled.
*   **Compatibility Issues:** Not all reusable pods are compatible with all Nespresso machines. Always check compatibility before purchasing.*   **Extraction Consistency:** Achieving consistent extraction can be more challenging compared to using pre-filled capsules. Due to the variance in grind size and tamping, the results may vary.
*   **""my Reusable Nespresso Pod Broke"":** While stainless steel pods are durable, malfunctions can happen. Check warranty details and contact the manufacturer. For plastic pods, gentle handling will extend lifespan.

With proper care and maintenance, reusable Nespresso pods can last for years. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent the buildup of coffee oils and ensure optimal performance.

Factors like the type of use and care can impact lifespan.

Budget, Needs and Wants Listed","Hey all – I've got another request for input on neighborhoods for our family of three with one car.

We may have an opportunity to move down to LA from the Bay Area at the end of May or beginning of June. With a kindergartner and a wife who doesn’t drive, planning ahead is the name of my game. My wife will need to commute to USC’s campus, so the Metro Rail is key for the mobility scooter that she uses.

Housing Needs

We're targeting up to $5,000/month for a 2+ bedroom house but can push to $6,000 if we find one we love. We can make do with one bathroom but would love 2 after living with just one for the past five years. A helpful factor for our budget is that we only need about 1,000 sq. ft. and a small outdoor space—anything extra is a bonus; too much is a burden.

Location Needs

We're looking for a neighborhood with very good or better elementary schools and within a 10-15 minute drive of a Metro Rail station. Her current BART commute is 30 minutes of train time, with a total door-to-door time of about 45-50 minutes. If we can stay within that range, we’re happy. She’s comfortable transferring if needed (e.g., taking the A or B line downtown). My search started with the E Line since it goes directly to USC, so we’ve looked at Culver City, Palms, Cheviot Hills, and the Rancho Park area—it seems like they have the schools, though budget/availability might be tight in some of them. I haven't looked elsewhere just yet, as I figured Reddit is the ultimate springboard for this type of thing.

Community Wants

We’re in our early 40s with a kid, so nightlife isn’t a priority anymore. That said, we love enjoying what the neighborhood/local area has to offer—parks, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants, markets, festivals, and the occasional brewery. These days, most of our social life revolves around our kid’s school and sports, along with my personal sports hobbies, so we're looking for a family-friendly environment with access to the rest. 

Where to Look?

Beyond the usual listing sites—Zillow, Redfin, Craigslist—are there any other platforms or sources I should be browsing? Should I check the major brokerages sites too?

A few things I’m debating:     
1.    USJ Day: I have a whole day dedicated to USJ (Universal Studios Japan), but I’m wondering if it’s worth the time. Should I swap it for more Tokyo exploration (e.g., Akihabara, Yoyogi, Pokémon Centers)?     

2.    Nikko Day Trip: I’m considering adding a day trip to Nikko on May 15, but I’m not sure if I have enough energy. Do you think it’s worth it, or should I relax and explore more of Tokyo instead?

Would love to hear any feedback or suggestions on my schedule, especially if you’ve been to Japan before! Am I missing any must-see spots or experiences? Thanks in advance",1,1741553163.0,itineraries,0,1.0,False

I see a lot of posts in this sub about coffee making people more anxious. I can 100% relate, as coffee generally makes me feel awful and increases my anxiety by A LOT. 5 hour energy’s do the same thing to me.

My meds make me pretty tired during the day so I feel like I need something to wake me up.

Sustained energy without the anxiety! I drink them pretty often now.

Yerba Mate is a caffeinated herbal tea. There are many benefits to it as well; rich in antioxidants and nutrients, boosts energy and focus levels, may enhance physical performance, may protect against infections, may help you lose weight and belly fat, lowers blood sugar levels, and may lower your risk of heart disease. (Source: healthline.com). It also doesn’t stain your teeth like coffee. 

You can buy it online or at places like CVS and chain grocery stores.

Two young hearts, two dreams unseen.

You had books and a future so bright,

I had a uniform ready to fight.

You cleared JEE, with joy in your eyes,

I got selected, saluted the skies.

You got into college, with plans ahead,

I trained hard no time for bed.

Your day started at 7, nice and slow,

Mine began at 4, with miles to go.

You studied late, with coffee in hand,

I stood on guard protecting our land.

You graduated in cap and gown,

I earned my stars, no need to frown.

You got a job with a fancy pay,

I was sent to serve without delay.

You went home to family every night,

While I dreamt of them by the bunkers light.

You celebrated with joy and cheer,

I shared stories with the comrades near.

We both found love, we both wore rings,

But our vows, they meant different things.

Your wife saw you each day's end,

While mine prayed for the letters I’d send.

You travelled for work, far and wide,

We came back, but not the same,

You walked in and I came with fame.

Your wife cried when she saw your face,

And you held her close in a warm embrace.

My wife cried too, but her heart in pain,

Because I couldn’t wipe her tears again.

For I lay still, in a flag draped bed,

Medals on my chest, my duty said.

Your life went on, with dreams and plans,

While Mine ended here, in this final stand.

We both left home at 18,

Two different lives, both brave and keen.

Your carried on, with love and light,

And mine ended here.

It’s especially confusing because we are completing a remodel on what will be our first property offered for vacation rental.  I hope that my guests have a much better experience than what we just completed. 

I did not complain to the host as it was a 3 night stay and not much they could do. 

After fees we paid $467/night. 

-The photos of the property were very outdated. The actual condition was no where close to what was represented. 
-Property listed as having a coffee grinder. Did not. Had to run to the store to buy ground coffee.
-TV in master bedroom did not work.
-Gas fireplace is main living did not work. 
-Down bath smelled of mold and visible mold growth on walls.
-No sponge or cloths to wash dishes with.
-Furniture so worn that you had to sit in cushions to have any support in the seat
-Smoke detectors beeping needing batteries
-Pool table was smaller than standard. No chalk for cues
-outside hot tub leaked water.  No hose to fill. I used a broken downspout to funnel water into the tub to fill it up. It would not heat up and leaked back down.  Unusable. 
-Possibly from broken downspout host had taped over the gutter. This allowed a constant drip on the deck. They had placed a rubber mat where the water splashed on the deck. This is a mountain house and it was very cold. This water spot froze and caused my brother to fall. It was the only slippery spot on the deck. 
-cutlery was miserable. 
-broken outdoor furniture.
-refrigerator cooled, but barely. Freezer was fine although I did have to unclog the ice chute to get the in door dispenser to work. 

The overall house was not especially clean and there was probably years of dust buildup on the ceiling fans. 

The home is in need of serious maintenance overall. Lot of small miscellaneous items that need repair or replacement. Sticking doors, doors that don’t lock, stone falling off the wall, sink stoppers missing or broken, etc. 

Perhaps I was being a little too critical or maybe this minimal quality is all that is expected. It’s especially confusing because the home has a 9.8 rating. However the reviews are generally older. The last review was in October of 2024. Some as far back as 2022 mentioned the worn furniture. 

I want to leave an honest review but at the same time I don’t want a retaliatory review that could affect my future listing. I hope that my guests never feel the way I do about our property. There are several processes I will be sure to implement as a result of this experience.

So what should I do?

I don't know why I acted like that. I obviously wish I had not done so. I know now that I was afraid of so many things. I wish I had told you about them. I wish we hadn't argued. That I had not been so infuriating, difficult, but more then anything else I wish that I didn't make you regret being kind and opening yourself up to me. I'm sure people had told you not to speak to me. So it's awful what has happened surely, and I been unable to think of anything else lately. I just think not knowing what has happened to you, if you are safe or okay, and thinking that i made you regret trusting me is something that hurts me even still.

I don't really know if I read your letters or not there is no way to really tell and for everyone that may be you, probably 20 that aren't. I really don't have anything to ask of you. I just hope wherever u may be, that you are OK.  I don't get to decide how you feel about me but I hope u won't always hate me. I don't want mean things I said to erase everything about me that was good. I think of that a lot to.

She is brilliant and beautiful and has a great sense of humor for those she feels comfortable around. She's empathetic and hard working, and I did really get lucky in having her as a partner, but all of that right now doesn't seem to matter in my head. 

She has a very demanding job (physician) and works crazy hours. We have one child together and want another, that hopefully will happen in the next year or so. We moved a couple years ago for her job, and I was lucky to find a job I've really grown to love and find a lot of meaning in myself. It's very hard for her to make friends, and as a dad who is often taking care of my toddler by myself while my wife is either working or recovering from long shifts on the weekend, I often feel like a single parent, with no support system, because the way I make friends traditionally has been through running, which is impossible to do with our schedules.  

I get my wife works very hard and doesn't mean to leave me on an island and I can hear people already saying ""you knew what you were getting marrying a doctor"", but the idea and the reality are very different. I do my best to keep up with my growing and demanding workload (I have a PhD in a science field and work at a large company so my job is also a lot at times), but sometimes I feel unseen. She tells me how grateful and thankful she is to have me in her life in cards for special occasions, and every once in a while she'll grab coffee for me coming home from work when she's getting some herself on the weekend after working a long shift, but I feel less like I have a wife, and more like a roommate who shares a child with me. 

I get the traditional thing is for the wife to have more domestic duties and I know many women would probably relate to this more, but I'm just so frustrated and sick of feeling alone. I have many friends but because we've moved, none of my other close friends live near me and I rarely get to do fun things.

Context -> So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.

So this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing. 

She dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.

For starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house. 

He is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.

Anyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad. 

I don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings. 

I hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.

Every time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone. 

But it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad

Latest chapter：Chapter 18
Chapter 1
I froze as I watched the video of Flynn Brooks, my mate and alpha of the Silver Moon pack with another she wolf, my heart hurt like a thousand knives stabbing into my chest as I realized the depth of the betrayal.
In the video, he sprawled in his red Ferrari, Vivienne, his mistress writhing on his lap. The car rocked, fogged-up windows barely concealing their naked bodies. Moans and gasps filled the air—raw, shameless.
My heart shattered, my wolf Lisa in pain.
I was Flynn's Luna. But the woman in the video—the one he was devouring—was his so-called ""true love.""
Their wild, reckless passion in the car had led to the inevitable: a devastating car crash. The image of the mangled vehicle still haunted my mind, a twisted reminder of their carelessness and the consequences it brought.
""Are you still willing to bleed for him?"" The Healer's voice yanked me back to reality.
Outside the emergency room, Alpha Flynn, my mate, lay unconscious on the hospital bed, his body covered in deep wounds.
I nodded without hesitation.
Even if the blood flowing from my veins wasn't meant to save an Alpha who cherished me, but a man who had already given his heart and body to someone else.
When I stepped out of the operating room, drained and weak, the mocking whispers of the wolf pack stung like daggers.
""Luna Jade is pathetic. No matter how much Flynn humiliates her, she just keeps crawling back for more.""
""Did you see that video? He's crazy about Vivienne. Meanwhile, his so-called Luna is out here offering up her own blood like a damn fool.""
I lowered my gaze, letting their words slide off me as I sipped the coffee in my hand. They didn’t know. They didn't need to know.
I had already started counting down the days to the end of this so-called ""Mate Bond.""
This time, I wouldn't look back.

1j7grar,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1j7grar/help_my_sil_is_ruining_my_wedding/,Help - my SIL is ruining my wedding,"Hey my Potato Queen. Big fan - sorry for the long post. 
I (30F) got engaged to my fiancé (30M) after being friends since we were teenagers. I moved from London for him and am learning a new language. It’s hard but worth it. We’re getting married this summer and initially everyone was very supportive and I felt like the child in me who was bullied and not popular at all was finally getting her dream come true. 
Of course everyone came with opinions and occasionally snide comments would get back to me but I was determined to get the wedding I wanted (we’re not rich, I’m just creative and always try negotiating). 
My sister in law (fiancés brothers girlfriend) Julie (26F) was supper supportive and I asked her to be a bridesmaid even though I didn’t know her well. I’m alone here so I needed someone to help and she was willing, even tearing up when I asked. I was so excited.
She also has two kids, 5 and 1, so at the planning stages I asked her before deciding whether she wanted the kids in the wedding (fiance and I didn’t). She said no and asked jokingly if we could make it a 3 day wedding so they could get time off. 

Perfect, no kids as I’ve only seen and heard horror stories when they’re in the wedding. I love kids and dote on her two boys, get them gifts, babysit (the rest of their family never does), but this is an expensive event that will be held in English and likely bore the kids into tantrums. Besides I wanted everyone to be able to fully enjoy themselves and celebrate us without worrying about changing dirty nappies or taking turns calming/entertaining their kids. My other friends and relatives were told to bring no kids too so they would be the only ones there which just made no sense. Everyone agreed kids make weddings hard.

Fast forward to 4 months before the wedding - we’re at the venue discussing decor. Julie suddenly decided she wanted kids there after all, I said I’d have to talk it through w fiance and although I didn’t mind (I did, so my fault for trying to spare her feelings) but I’d have to think. Despite this she already started instructing the venue coordinator where kids seats would go (we never agreed they would stay for the evening), the coordinator didn’t speak English so I was getting frustrated because among other things, all of my decisions were being questioned with comments like “are you really making a big deal over 100 euros”, “maybe this place isn’t for you”, “you can’t have everything you want” (I didn’t even get a chance to say what I wanted, and we had already put the deposit down so this wasn’t helpful). Then Julie told me I was getting too emotional and needed to calm down (at that point I wasn’t even in my final form lol and was imo mildly irritated) so I told her to please stop managing me and my wedding and arguing with me, because I’m feeling ganged up on and I needed space. I hadn’t walked 10 feet when I heard her muttering something about me to my fiance and MIL. I was so angry, so I eventually calmed down but disassociated the rest of the day.
Following weekend I thought about it constantly, unsure if Julie could actually support me the way that I needed and if the kids were going to throw tantrums (kids are kids, it’s not their fault) she would be just as likely to make me feel bad about it. 
I then messaged to say that I was sorry but I don’t think having the kids there is going to work, explaining that we had already told other guests no (who were coming from abroad), including my own sister, and it was just going to complicate everything unnecessarily. I reiterated that I loved her and didn’t want to upset her, and if she wanted to talk through we could meet up. I also offered to do a little bridal breakfast just with the kids so that we could celebrate separately and they’d feel included.

Julie responded with saying that then she wouldn’t be attending the ceremony or be a bridesmaid then, and would just join the evening festivities. 
I was shaking. It took me hours to calm down and I replied saying that I was hurt that she reacted like that, explaining that I never said they could come but that I’d have to think about it and talk it through. I finished with saying that I will give her space and when she’s ready, I am happy to talk things through.

Then my fiance got a message from his parents inviting themselves over for coffee the following day. Three guesses why.
For context, fiancés dad is having heart issues, with two clots in his lungs and leg. Mother was suffering from stress from work and was given time off.
Parents came and as I suspected they came to ask why the kids weren’t invited. I explained, fighting an active panic attack, palms sweating and heart beating wildly. I didn’t want to argue because I didn’t want to stress them further. I could see mother worrying because Julie had withheld the kids from them last time Julie had arguments with the mother and there was a lot of drama. Mother is rightly concerned that she will lose her son again.
Parents said they didn’t understand but it’s our wedding so we decide, and they don’t want to pressure us or take sides. I pointed out that them being there puts pressure on me no matter what and I really didn’t appreciate Julie going to the them behind my back to get them to fight her battles for her. Fiance agreed with me and said he never liked Julie, because she had a habit of acting like a princess. 
I seriously considered kicking her out of the wedding altogether, and letting the kids come with their father. 
For days this was on my mind and I wasn’t given space - I got text from the father and the mother asking for an update which was that I was still waiting for Julie to let me know when she wanted to talk. 
Following weekend the mother asks again and we have a long conversation about how I felt my boundaries were crossed and how this was the exact opposite to what I needed months from the wedding. Having this on my mind was giving me regular anxiety attacks, I was constantly shaking whenever thinking or talking about it. The parents kept saying that they were ready to mediate and have all of us together to talk things through. 
I didn’t understand why 6 people needed to be a part of the conversation when only Julie was the one with problems with me. I didn’t want for there to be a repeat of me feeling ganged up against (for either of us) and I didn’t want the parents to be put through a potentially stressful argument.
Fiancés mum called again to ask for an update I was fed up with this anxiety, so I said that that for her sake and the father’s health, I’ll reach out again to Julie to see if she wanted to talk. 
By that point I was actually done with Julie - I didn’t understand why she was making such a big mess over something that should be a joyous time. How was she expecting this to impact our relationship? 
Julie agreed to talk and we called (on loudspeaker for my fiance to hear) - I had all of my walls up, all business and I wasn’t interested in arguing. 
I began with saying that we could deal with it ourselves, as it would only complicate things if we involve others. 
I asked if she wanted to come to the wedding, and she said yes, and then I said the only way that I could see the kids being there is if they had someone else with them to supervise and to take them home. Julie said that she didn’t know if her mother would be willing to take time off at which point I said that I will leave the logistics of it to them as 4 moths should be enough time to figure something out and this compromise should make everyone happy. 
Julie proceeded to talk, often cutting me off to tell me how she wanted future issues to be talked through over the phone and not by text. She almost shouted at that point which is when, and this was petty, I told her I couldn’t hear her, the connection was bad. It took the wind out of her rant right away and worked as a little amusing treat for me to keep me sane. She then repeated her “demand”.
I explained that due to my ADHD it helps to type out my thoughts so that I cover everything I wanted to say but that if she struggled with texts, so that it would be fair to both, we could see what works best and she could let me know when she needed me to call her instead. 
To that she got snappy saying “You always say I struggle with things and I don’t like it. I don’t struggle with anything, everything is fine with me so you need to stop saying it because I get upset when you do.”
Maybe I overused the word without thinking (she never said she had something against it) but didn’t she just say that she didn’t like talking things through over text???

I thought I was being empathetic but apparently any time I said that I understood her struggles when she mentioned wanting to lose her baby weight or how work was hard or the baby was keeping her up. But turned out that she saw all of those moments as attacks or ways to undermine her. 
I’d never do something like that on purpose but I admit that having lost weight myself through exercise, I thought I could have helped her. I also shared that despite hitting my goal weight, I was getting judged more than ever and I still had things I didn’t like about myself - saying that weight doesn’t matter.
She finished with this cherry on top “this is why I wanted there to be people to witness the conversation”. 
I asked to clarify “what as in if I take what you say and twist it?”
She said yes.
WTF???
I don’t know if it was a language barrier (never had problems before, but she kept on insisting that language was suddenly an issue now so maybe) but I couldn’t believe she actually said that - how poorly did she think of me? Since when? If I was as bad as all that, why come to the wedding at all?

It’s been two weeks and this is still a topic even though I offered a compromise to keep peace until the wedding. Fiancé’s brother told my fiance the 5 year old apparently cried when he heard he wasn’t going to the wedding (why was the child even told anything? This is just emotional blackmailing) I still get anxiety attacks and my blood pressure has rocketed since. 

It didn’t help that I lost my job recently too and I’m struggling financially and there is so much to do but no one really to help, because at this point, it’s less stress doing it yourself. World news are stressing me out too because my fiance is in the army and I’m scared he’ll have to go fighting.
Julie messaged the family group saying they’re throwing a party for their kids’ birthdays. 

I don’t want to go, because I can imagine that Julie would have complained about me as this horrible, vicious person to her parents and friends too but I will send presents because it’s not the kids’ fault. Fiance said he wouldn’t go either if I wanted but honestly I don’t know what’s worse. I told him to go. Didn’t need more judgement about now keeping the uncle away, the monster that I am.

To top it all off, today my fiance told that Julie apparently thought she was still a bridesmaid. What do you mean? 
I don’t know what to do - I don’t think I can handle any more conflict. I want to tell all of them to F off at this point. The looming conflict is hanging over my head but I don’t have the strength to fight and search for a new job and plan the wedding and mind my mental health. Am I being petty and overly dramatic because honestly I don’t think they’ve even seen the worst I could be. I take things to heart and this is something I’m not likely to forget or forgive. None of the other 50 guests have caused this many problems for me.

They haven’t had to pay for anything or do any bridal events and yet instead of helping me as they should, they create pressure and anxiety for me with little to no consideration towards my wellbeing.
I don’t need people like that in my life but I don’t want fiancé’s parents to suffer in the crossfire, and I don’t want more drama at the wedding. ",7,1741551930.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,11,0.82,False

1j7gpwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/1j7gpwp/peterson_nietzsche_and_kierkegaard_arguing_chat/,"Peterson, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard arguing - Chat GTP","# Scene: A Timeless Café, Suspended in Thought

The setting is a dimly lit café, seemingly outside time and space. Candlelight flickers on wooden tables, and the faint smell of tobacco and old books lingers in the air. Outside, a storm brews, though no one knows if it is real or symbolic.

Seated at a round table are **Friedrich Nietzsche**, his mustache bristling as he swirls a glass of red wine; **Søren Kierkegaard**, his hands folded neatly, a cup of black coffee untouched in front of him; and **Jordan Peterson**, adjusting his suit jacket, a bottle of sparkling water beside him.

**Peterson** (leaning forward, gesturing): The problem, gentlemen, is that in abandoning tradition—religion, responsibility, hierarchy—modern man has become lost. Nietzsche, you saw it coming, the “death of God” and all. But you thought we could just replace Him with something else. You were wrong. Look at the chaos we have now!

**Nietzsche** (laughing bitterly): Oh, don’t be so naïve, doctor. You clutch at the ruins of Christianity like a drowning man grasping at driftwood. What you call “chaos,” I call an opportunity. The weak may suffer, but the strong—ah, the strong will rise!

**Kierkegaard** (sighing, shaking his head): You are both mistaken. The problem is not that God is dead, but that man refuses to humble himself before Him. Faith is not about clinging to social order, as Peterson suggests, nor is it about brute strength, as Nietzsche dreams. It is about the individual’s leap into the unknown!

**Nietzsche** (mocking): Ah yes, the “leap of faith.” Into what, exactly? More suffering? More servitude? Religion is nothing but shackles! Christianity glorifies weakness—it tells the herd to bow, to suffer, to obey! I say—let them perish and make way for the Overman!

**Peterson** (frowning): But look at what happens when people abandon moral structure. We get resentment, nihilism, totalitarianism. People need meaning!

**Nietzsche** (leaning in, eyes blazing): And I gave them meaning! The will to power! Man is not a meek lamb seeking comfort; he is a beast meant to **conquer**!

**Kierkegaard** (calmly): And yet, Friedrich, you died alone, insane, embraced by the very abyss you claimed to master. Tell me, did your “will to power” save you from despair?

**Nietzsche** (pauses, tightening his grip on his glass): … I would rather die seeking greatness than live groveling before a god that demands I renounce myself.

**Peterson** (nodding solemnly): That’s exactly the problem. You reject God, but then you still want meaning. You still want purpose. But when you remove God, you remove the very foundation of truth itself. That’s why society is crumbling.

**Nietzsche** (grinning): And yet, you, Dr. Peterson, who claim to uphold order, only do so because you are afraid of what comes next. You think you can resurrect God with psychology? No. God is **dead**, and we have killed Him. Now we must become gods ourselves—or be crushed beneath history.

**Kierkegaard** (softly, almost whispering): No man can bear the weight of being God, Friedrich. That is why Christ took it upon Himself.

Silence falls between them. The storm outside grows louder.

**Peterson** (after a long pause): Maybe we’re all just terrified of what happens if we’re wrong.

The wind howls outside, rattling the windows of the timeless café. The three men sit in silence for a moment, their drinks untouched, as the weight of their words lingers between them. A waiter, ghostly and indifferent, refills Nietzsche’s glass of wine and sets down another coffee for Kierkegaard. Peterson exhales, rubbing his hands together.

**Nietzsche** (leaning back, smirking): Afraid of being wrong, you say? That is precisely why I reject your entire premise. Weak men fear being wrong, so they cling to their comfortable illusions—God, morality, tradition. But I embrace the abyss! I do not beg for meaning—I **create** it.

**Kierkegaard** (nodding, folding his hands): And yet, Friedrich, you tremble at the edge of the abyss, pretending not to be afraid. You speak of “becoming gods,” but tell me—what god has ever gone mad from his own philosophy?

**Nietzsche** (tensing, gripping his glass): I did not go mad because I was wrong. I went mad because I saw **too much**. The truth is unbearable to those who are not strong enough to hold it.

**Peterson** (adjusting his suit, nodding): You see, that’s exactly it! This is what happens when you remove **responsibility** and **order**. You think you're free when you reject moral structure, but you just become lost. You saw too much? No, you saw **too little**—you dismissed the fundamental truth that meaning is not **created**, it is **discovered**.

**Nietzsche** (laughing bitterly): Oh, how very Christian of you, doctor! Always speaking of responsibility, structure, and meaning as if they were divine laws written into the universe. But what if there is no cosmic order, no grand design? What if all this— (gestures around, eyes burning) **is just chaos pretending to be order**?

**Kierkegaard** (smiling faintly): Even if that were true, Friedrich, do you not see? It is precisely because the world seems chaotic that faith is necessary. The leap into the unknown, the embrace of paradox—this is where truth resides.

**Peterson** (leaning in, voice firm): But it’s not just faith—it’s **responsibility**! When people abandon moral tradition, they drift into nihilism, resentment, self-destruction. Look at the modern world! Depression, addiction, ideology—people are desperate for meaning, and they are turning to **false gods** instead of real ones.

**Nietzsche** (grinning, shaking his head): And yet, I see no gods, Peterson. Only frightened men who cannot bear the thought that their suffering has no higher purpose. You preach about meaning, but I ask you—**what if there is none?** What if the real test of man is to stare into that void and laugh?

**Kierkegaard** (gently, but piercingly): And what if, Friedrich, the true test of man is to **stare into that void and kneel**?

**Nietzsche** (scoffs, but his fingers tighten on his glass): Kneel? Never. I would rather burn.

**Peterson** (softly): And yet, you did.

The room falls silent. Nietzsche’s eyes flicker with something—anger? Doubt? He takes a slow sip of wine, his usual smirk faltering for just a moment.

Kierkegaard watches him with quiet sympathy. Peterson exhales, staring down at the table, lost in thought.

The storm outside does not relent.

The storm outside reaches its peak—thunder cracks, shaking the windows. A sudden gust blows the candle flames sideways, casting flickering shadows on the walls. Inside, the tension at the table is thick, but the debate is nearing its breaking point.

Nietzsche’s fingers drum against his wine glass, his eyes dark with intensity. Kierkegaard remains still, his hands folded in quiet patience. Peterson looks between them, his expression a mix of exhaustion and determination.

**Nietzsche** (smirking, but weary): You speak of responsibility, of faith, of kneeling before the unknown. And yet, tell me, has any of this **saved** man? Has faith prevented suffering? Has your precious moral order done anything but chain men to mediocrity?

**Kierkegaard** (softly): No, it has not prevented suffering. But it has **redeemed** it.

**Nietzsche** (leaning in, eyes burning): Redeemed? Tell that to the millions who cry out in vain to a silent god! Tell that to those who suffer without meaning! Your Christ may have carried the cross, but he has left the rest of us to rot in the dirt.

**Peterson** (firmly): But that’s just it, Friedrich. **Suffering is inevitable.** You know this better than anyone. The question isn’t how to avoid it—but what to do with it.

**Nietzsche** (laughing bitterly): And you say I am the madman! Suffering is **fuel**. It is the forge of the strong! But to endure it for some imaginary redemption? That is weakness!

**Kierkegaard** (tilting his head): And yet, Friedrich, even you did not escape suffering. You were consumed by it. Did your will to power save you?

**Nietzsche** (pauses, gripping his glass; a shadow passes over his face): …No.

The admission hangs in the air. The storm outside seems to soften, as if listening.

**Peterson** (gently): That’s why responsibility matters. Not as a burden, but as a way forward. You talk of creating meaning, but what if meaning isn’t something we **invent**—what if it’s something we must **live** into?

**Nietzsche** (gritting his teeth): And you call that living? Shackled to duty, to dogma, to guilt? No. I would rather suffer freely than kneel in comfort.

**Kierkegaard** (smiling slightly): But that is where we are the same, you and I. I, too, embrace suffering. But I do not embrace it **alone**.

**Peterson** (nodding, quietly): And maybe that’s the real difference.

Nietzsche looks at them both, something unreadable in his eyes. He lifts his glass, then hesitates. His whole life, he had sought to tear down illusions. But now, sitting across from these men—one who had embraced faith, and one who had defended responsibility—he wondered…

Had he been fighting **against** something? Or simply fighting **alone**?

Outside, the storm finally **breaks**.

A sudden, eerie stillness settles over the café. The candlelight no longer flickers violently; instead, it burns steady and strong. The three men sit in silence.

At last, Nietzsche exhales and lifts his glass.

**Nietzsche** (softly, almost amused): To suffering, then.

Kierkegaard lifts his coffee. Peterson lifts his water.

**Kierkegaard** (gently): To what comes after.

**Peterson** (nodding): To responsibility.

They clink their glasses together.

a bit of advice would be welcome as I have zero experience with guys.

Personal info: I am f27 and he is m36.

First I need to provide some context because our relationship started complicated - we were on quite bad terms for 3 months due some work related drama (we don't work in same department nor are our jobs really connected, but whole company and human resources were a bit screwed up). Then I made first step towards getting along by giving him some pralines for his birthday - I liked him from the first time we met even though we were on different sides of everything. After that gift he asked me out for a drinks and when I asked him out again next week, he made some silly excuse. However, he continued to text me - we had three months of texting each other maybe once a week but no real contact in person except occasional meeting in company common area. In this texts he did, however, notice small details about me - my mood, what I wore which day, jokes I made and so on. I didn’t want to ask him out again as he refused me last time.

Two weeks ago, however, he asked me out on coffee. We had 3 hours of brilliant fun and he hugged me after. We also had few long texts after that, but he is inconsistent - sometimes he texts long, sometimes he replies with three words… I asked him out, he accepted. Our conversations are full of banter, jokes and compliments. I often look him straight in the eyes and he sometimes compliments “wicked spark” I have in them. On that other coffee, I suggested an outdoor activity (kayaking) which he agreed on instantly. We went kayaking and basically spent 8 hours together. A lot of banter again, we were really close to each other and in few moments I think he subtly acknowledged being aware that I fancy him (For example, I told him he is being silly, he replied that that’s why I find him interesting). He shared some ultra personal information (maybe he doesn’t find it as personal as I do, I don’t know) about ex-girlfriends, mental health and wishes for future. However, not once did he try to get closer to me in physical sense, no touches, no kisses, nothing. After that whole day spent together he just gave me really quick hug and that’s it. He didn’t mention any further plans except to see me at work.

So I am just so confused. I keep overanalysing his every word. I have no idea how to interpret that behaviour - does he like me, does he just enjoys that someone likes him, is he just to polite to refuse my kayaking offer… I don’t know if I am expecting too much to soon?

UGH

1j7gia4,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1j7gia4/seeking_coffee_roaster_and_grinder/,Seeking coffee roaster and grinder recommendations for a new business,"Hello! I'm in the early, early stages of starting a new cafe and bookstore business. I will be hiring baristas once things get underway, but in the meantime, I'm needing to finalise my estimate of starting expenses before I can move forward. Can anyone recommend a roaster and grinder that would be the safest choice for a new business that's still gaging demand? Most recommendations I've found online are understandably for those who already know what demand will be, but I'm unclear how to approach this as a completely new business.

By 'safe choice,' I mean: a) Does the basics very well and reliably, b) Can easily handle the early days of low demand but comfortably adjust to higher levels later on (though I'm definitely not expecting to have extremely high demand very soon).

Ideally, I'd like to not spend more than £5k ($6.5k) in total for both, but can go slightly above if the machines are worth it. I'm aware that the roaster will be the biggest expense and quality is a big deal to me, so please give me your recommendations for roasters that are above this price range IF there is a must-have for creating fantastic, high-quality coffee.

Thank you in advance to anyone who responds! I apologise for sounding like a noob -- I am not super knowledgeable about the coffee prep process, but am very much trying to learn the essentials along the way.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.",1,1741551172.0,ArtificialSentience,6,1.0,False

1j7gftu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j7gftu/he_works_and_sleeps_all_day/,He works and sleeps all day!,"Me (31F) and my husband (35M) have been together over 15 years with a teenage daughter. We both work full time jobs. He has been at his job for over 10 years. His schedule is Monday-Friday 6:30am-5:30pm rotating days to night every two weeks, weekends off. I work as management in retail so rarely weekends off and work any hours of the day at a given time with 9 hour shifts.

Now lately all he does is work, come home, sleep from 6-8:30p, workout from 9:30-10p and back to sleep. 
If he schedules any leisure time it is at the bar with coworkers (I am sober and stopped drinking 2 year ago). I get 1 Saturday a month and 2 rotating Sundays off a month in which most of the time it’s me and my daughter spending time together , while he stays home and sleeps until 3-4pm…. 

I have expressed that it makes me feel lonely and bothers me that when I ask to go out for a coffee or walk around shops that I am telling him what to do and I can go out myself if I don’t want to be home “that badly” but he has no problem making plans with other people. “We live together and that should be enough” is what he has said to me..

He has been on anxiety and depression meds for almost 2 years now so it has been diagnosed but I’m not sure what else to do or say to get him to understand where I am coming from. 


TLDR: husband just works sleeps, or goes to the bar and I feel lonely. Tells me I am wrong for telling him what to do on his time. ",3,1741551085.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Søren Kierkegaard, dressed in his usual somber attire, sits with his hands neatly folded, a cup of coffee in front of him. Across from him, Friedrich Nietzsche, wearing a slightly disheveled coat, leans forward, his intense eyes gleaming in the candlelight. The café is quiet except for the occasional murmur of other patrons and the faint sound of rain against the window.

**Kierkegaard** (smiling wryly, stirring his coffee): Women, my dear Nietzsche, are creatures of contradiction—both a gift and a torment to men. I have loved but one, and in that love, I found despair.

**Nietzsche** (scoffs, sipping his wine): You speak as a man who has known love and fled from it. If you had truly understood the nature of women, you would see that love itself is the grandest illusion, a trick of nature to keep men enslaved.

**Kierkegaard** (raising an eyebrow): And yet, you have never loved. What authority do you have to speak on the matter?

**Nietzsche** (grinning, leaning back): I observe, Søren. I see men destroyed by love, worshipping women as if they were divine. But woman—she is not divine. She is will to power in its most seductive form. She ensnares man not with reason, but with instinct, with her cunning.

**Kierkegaard** (shaking his head): You see only the surface, Friedrich. A woman is not merely a force of nature; she is a reflection of man’s soul. To love her is to see one’s own weaknesses laid bare. That is why I turned away from my beloved Regine. Love demanded too much—it demanded my very self.

**Nietzsche** (mockingly): Ah, so you chose despair instead? How very Christian of you. Always suffering, always renouncing. Tell me, did it make you free?

**Kierkegaard** (quietly): It made me true to myself. Love is not about possession, as you seem to believe. It is a burden, yes, but also a divine calling.

**Nietzsche** (chuckling darkly): Love? A divine calling? No, my friend, it is a battlefield where the strongest prevail. Men like you see love as sacrifice. Men like me see it as conquest.

**Kierkegaard** (smirking): And yet, it is I who have known love, and you who have merely speculated. Tell me, Friedrich, which of us is truly enslaved?

Nietzsche is silent for a moment, his fingers tapping against his glass. The rain outside intensifies, as if echoing the tension between them.",0,1741551005.0,kierkegaard,3,0.17,False
