if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

And your voice, it's so low, so melodious. The perfect sound. So relaxing. I love hearing it after a long day. I love the words you tell me, the innocent ones and the flirty ones. Sometimes your voice sends shivers down my spine. 

This slow burn we have is so exhilarating. It's so... healthy. I don't have to worry about what you're doing behind my back or me behind yours. I am so glad life slowed us enough so I could heal into a person that could trust you and love you correctly. 

You are amazing in so many ways. You're financially driven like me. You don't judge how I heal, or make me feel like what I went through wasn't valid. You are so cute when you talk about your passions. You are so comforting, I feel so protected with you. I like letting you take the lead. 

Falling asleep in your arms was a beautiful experience. God, I wish we could do that more. Just lie together, wrapped in a warm blanket. 

There's a realistic future here and I am so excited to start it. I can see us living together. Ordering coffee or matcha when we forget to make it. Take turns making food, help each other keep it organized. 

Just you and me, and maybe if we do this forever a little or two. Forever with you seems like a dream this early. I don't want to scare you away with my intensity, so we will take this at your pace. You know I like you.  I know you like me. It's going so well so far.

Those of us in support of that don’t want people to go hungry. We just want people to have a reality check. 

The vast majority of people simply need to learn to live with less and not be so entitled. Period. If you are on a tight budget, guess what, that means you can’t afford the luxury of name brands for most of your shopping and get your hair done and your nails done and $9 coffees every morning and eat out all the time. I understand there are a lot of people who genuinely do struggle even working two jobs and need help. Especially in big cities. But COME ON. Big Mama and her 5 kids coming through my line on a Tuesday morning with 2 carts piled to the brim with crap, being covered 85% or more by assistance programs does NOT need more handouts, she needs job applications. 

I can even understand being busy and not feeling like cooking. I love to cook and bake but you can be sure I’m not too keen to do it after work getting off at seven. I get buying premade food and that making things at home is not an option for some people… but for those who do have that option that’s what they need to do if they want to save money. It’s just common sense. 

The quiet part no one wants to say out loud is that it’s largely a generational thing. Boomers and older are so f*cking cheap. Did they luck out coming to age in a booming economy? Yes. Did they also learn basic home ec and fiscal skills which save money? Also yes.

You cannot have your cake and eat it too. You do not have the *luxury* of organic, of high-end, of convenience; you don’t get to buy the $10 thing when there’s a $5 option, over and over, then be pissed off and confused when you’re broke. Sacrifices have to be made unless you’re a millionaire, and that doesn’t mean being a total utilitarian about it, but you can’t live beyond your means and expect the money to just magically stretch where you need it to.

There’s an old saying from the Great Depression era: use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without. Young people don’t know HOW to do without. It’s gimme gimme gimme, and gimme it NOW.

I’ve lived at or below being poor my entire life. I’m 26. I’m among the only person in my group of friends and coworkers who doesn’t blow metric fuck tons of money on alcohol, weed, fast food, coffees, door dash, concert tickets, clothes, makeup, nails, hair, the latest technology…it adds up. People need to learn to appreciate the simple things in life and that’s that. 

Now for the people who genuinely are unable to provide for themselves and their kids…just about every church in the country has, and has always had, a food pantry. This is not new. It’s not being as widely spread as the church of Satan’s food program because it’s been an everyday thing literally for decades. 

But I simply don’t believe that’s the majority, or even the majority of people just struggling. Self-sabotage and irresponsibility have been normalized to such a degree that people can’t even see that they’re creating their own problems anymore.

1okkxdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1okkxdi/the_whispering_crystal/,The Whispering Crystal,"The summer of 2017 should have been a period of invigorating solitude for Kaelen, perched high above Starfall Valley at the remote Aurora Peak Observatory. As a junior astrophysicist, she cherished the quiet hum of the machinery, the vast, inky canvas of the night sky, and the profound sense of isolation that allowed her thoughts to truly expand. Her days revolved around monitoring subtle cosmic anomalies, translating cryptic data into theoretical elegance. Among her few personal possessions was a unique obsidian shard she’d discovered half-buried near the observatory’s oldest, decommissioned telescope. It was a triangular piece of polished black stone, impossibly smooth, etched with faint, unknown glyphs that pulsed with a soft, internal violet light, particularly vibrant under the starlight. She kept it on her workstation, a small, grounding mystery in a world of grand ones.

One blustery afternoon, a sudden, violent electrical storm swept through the valley, rattling the observatory’s ancient structure. A powerful surge fried part of the central console, sending sparks showering across Kaelen’s desk. Amidst the chaos of frantic repairs, the obsidian shard, her silent companion, was knocked from its usual spot and vanished into the labyrinthine wiring and discarded components. Annoyed, Kaelen searched but the storm damage was extensive, and the small shard was easily overlooked in the urgent scramble to restore power. She eventually accepted its loss, though a strange, prickling emptiness began to bloom within her, a subtle glitch in her otherwise ordered reality. The observatory, once a sanctuary of logic, now felt subtly… wrong.

Days blurred into weeks, then months. Kaelen had almost forgotten the shard when, one frigid winter evening in 2019, she found it again. Not in the clutter of her workstation, but perfectly centered on her pillow, radiating that eerie violet glow, far more intense than she remembered. Her blood ran cold. She hadn't been in her sleeping quarters for hours, and the observatory was locked down. How could it have reappeared? The shard, once a simple curiosity, now radiated an aura of absolute wrongness, a cursed relic. Sleep became a distant fantasy, the air around her thickening with an invisible presence, a chilling frequency vibrating in her bones.

The world subtly warped around Kaelen. Shadows elongated and writhed at the edge of her vision, faint whispers teased her sanity, and the shard, when held, drew warmth from the room, leaving a lingering chill. But the reflections were the worst; her own image would sometimes smile independently in the polished surfaces of the telescope lenses, a subtly distorted echo deciding whether to truly synchronize before her own face could react. She tried to discard the shard — she flushed it down a utility drain, left it hidden under a rock in the sparse, snowy landscape, even attempted to blast it with a focused laser, but it always reappeared: on her pillow, nestled inside her empty coffee mug, or, most chillingly, wedged perfectly into the folds of her sleeping bag. Its persistence was a suffocating tether, a relentless reminder of an unwelcome connection.

One evening, the shard didn't just return; it began projecting fragmented, unsettling images directly into her mind. Not static visions, but a torrent of ancient, non-human perspectives: fleeting glimpses of impossible geometries, vast cosmic entities, and a ritual of galactic-scale containment. It wasn't a whisper she heard, but a silent, desperate plea for reunion woven through these visions, a primordial consciousness yearning to reassemble itself. This was The Whispering Crystal, a sentient mineral entity, a fragment of The Void-Weaver, shattered eons ago during a cosmic cataclysm. The observatory, situated on a rare nexus of telluric energies, made Kaelen a suitable conduit, her scientific detachment a vulnerability. The shard's relentless return was a deliberate, calculated act by a nascent fragment of this larger consciousness, drawn to her own deep-seated feeling of incompleteness, transforming her into its unwitting anchor.

Terrified yet utterly compelled, Kaelen confessed everything to her mentor, Professor Alistair Finch, a reclusive academic known for his unorthodox theories on quantum consciousness and ancient civilizations. Professor Finch, alarmed by Kaelen’s increasingly erratic behavior and vivid descriptions, recognized the glyphs on the shard. He confirmed they matched ancient symbols found in forgotten texts, believed to be the language of ""celestial architects"" and multi-dimensional beings. He knew the object was dangerous, a fragment of something immense and malevolent.

Professor Finch arrived at the Aurora Peak Observatory, his face grim. He explained that the Whispering Crystal was a remnant of a primordial intelligence that had once tried to impose its will on existence, only to be shattered into countless fragments and scattered across realities. The observatory, built on a site of unique energetic confluence, was inadvertently a beacon. He believed a scientific containment ritual, utilizing the observatory’s main dish to generate a counter-frequency, could sever the connection between Kaelen and the shard, possibly nullifying its influence.

They set up the equipment in the main observation dome, the colossal telescope silently pointing at the star-studded ceiling, its intricate mechanisms repurposed. As Professor Finch calibrated the frequencies, Kaelen, trembling, placed the pulsing obsidian shard at the center of a makeshift containment field. The air crackled with anticipation. The shard’s violet glow intensified, then flared, not just with violet, but with impossible colors – blues that hurt the eyes, greens that tasted like static, oranges that felt like sound. The containment field pulsed, humming with an overwhelming, discordant energy. Kaelen felt a deep, unsettling sense of belonging as the energy washed over her, a resonant hum that vibrated through her very bones, pulling at her essence.
The containment field didn't just activate; it completed something. The shard didn't fracture or disappear. Instead, as the iridescent light enveloped Kaelen, she felt an indescribable melding. Her sense of self, her individual thoughts and memories, began to dissolve, not painfully, but with an almost comforting fluidity. The obsidian shard, with its impossible colors, wasn’t contained; it was becoming a part of her, her new core.

Professor Finch, watching with tired eyes, offered a faint, sad smile as the dome grew silent. Kaelen was forever marked, not by a scar, but by an internal transformation. The whispers in her mind didn't cease; they multiplied, becoming a chorus, then a vast, echoing symphony of thoughts that were not her own, yet profoundly were her. She understood, with a chilling, cosmic clarity, that the containment had not been for the shard. It had been for her. She was not merely connected to The Void-Weaver; she was its anchor, its physical manifestation in this reality. The fragmented consciousness had not sought reunion with itself, but a stable, living vessel in a new dimension. Kaelen’s existence, once mundane and isolated, had made her the perfect ""liminal space"" for its full emergence. She felt a profound and resonant calm, but also an awareness of an infinite branching of realities, her own consciousness now spread across countless parallel universes, seeing through them all. She was no longer Kaelen. She was the central point of a new ""Echoing Prison,"" both the prisoner and the warden, a silent, all-encompassing nexus of the Whispering Crystal, finally fully assembled.

A powerful surge fried part of the central console, sending sparks showering across Kaelen’s desk. Amidst the chaos of frantic repairs, the obsidian shard, her silent companion, was knocked from its usual spot and vanished into the labyrinthine wiring and discarded components. Annoyed, Kaelen searched but the storm damage was extensive, and the small shard was easily overlooked in the urgent scramble to restore power. She eventually accepted its loss, though a strange, prickling emptiness began to bloom within her, a subtle glitch in her otherwise ordered reality. The observatory, once a sanctuary of logic, now felt subtly… wrong.

Days blurred into weeks, then months. Kaelen had almost forgotten the shard when, one frigid winter evening in 2019, she found it again. Not in the clutter of her workstation, but perfectly centered on her pillow, radiating that eerie violet glow, far more intense than she remembered. Her blood ran cold. She hadn't been in her sleeping quarters for hours, and the observatory was locked down. How could it have reappeared? The shard, once a simple curiosity, now radiated an aura of absolute wrongness, a cursed relic. Sleep became a distant fantasy, the air around her thickening with an invisible presence, a chilling frequency vibrating in her bones.

The world subtly warped around Kaelen. Shadows elongated and writhed at the edge of her vision, faint whispers teased her sanity, and the shard, when held, drew warmth from the room, leaving a lingering chill. But the reflections were the worst; her own image would sometimes smile  independently in the polished surfaces of the telescope lenses, a subtly distorted echo deciding whether to truly synchronize before her own face could react. She tried to discard the shard — she flushed it down a utility drain, left it hidden under a rock in the sparse, snowy landscape, even attempted to blast it with a focused laser, but it always reappeared: on her pillow, nestled inside her empty coffee mug, or, most chillingly, wedged perfectly into the folds of her sleeping bag. Its persistence was a suffocating tether, a relentless reminder of an unwelcome connection.

One evening, the shard didn't just return; it began projecting fragmented, unsettling images directly into her mind. Not static visions, but a torrent of ancient, non-human perspectives: fleeting glimpses of impossible geometries, vast cosmic entities, and a ritual of galactic-scale containment. It wasn't a whisper she heard, but a silent, desperate plea for reunion woven through these visions, a primordial consciousness yearning to reassemble itself. This was The Whispering Crystal, a sentient mineral entity, a fragment of The Void-Weaver, shattered eons ago during a cosmic cataclysm. The observatory, situated on a rare nexus of telluric energies, made Kaelen a suitable conduit, her scientific detachment a vulnerability. The shard's relentless return was a deliberate, calculated act by a nascent fragment of this larger consciousness, drawn to her own deep-seated feeling of incompleteness, transforming her into its unwitting anchor.

Terrified yet utterly compelled, Kaelen confessed everything to her mentor, Professor Alistair Finch, a reclusive academic known for his unorthodox theories on quantum consciousness and ancient civilizations. Professor Finch, alarmed by Kaelen’s increasingly erratic behavior and vivid descriptions, recognized the glyphs on the shard. He confirmed they matched ancient symbols found in forgotten texts, believed to be the language of ""celestial architects"" and multi-dimensional beings. He knew the object was dangerous, a fragment of something immense and malevolent.

Professor Finch arrived at the Aurora Peak Observatory, his face grim. He explained that the Whispering Crystal was a remnant of a primordial intelligence that had once tried to impose its will on existence, only to be shattered into countless fragments and scattered across realities. The observatory, built on a site of unique energetic confluence, was inadvertently a beacon. He believed a scientific containment ritual, utilizing the observatory’s main dish to generate a counter-frequency, could sever the connection between Kaelen and the shard, possibly nullifying its influence.

They set up the equipment in the main observation dome, the colossal telescope silently pointing at the star-studded ceiling, its intricate mechanisms repurposed. As Professor Finch calibrated the frequencies, Kaelen, trembling, placed the pulsing obsidian shard at the center of a makeshift containment field. The air crackled with anticipation. The shard’s violet glow intensified, then flared, not just with violet, but with impossible colors – blues that hurt the eyes, greens that tasted like static, oranges that felt like sound. The containment field pulsed, humming with an overwhelming, discordant energy. Kaelen felt a deep, unsettling sense of belonging as the energy washed over her, a resonant hum that vibrated through her very bones, pulling at her essence.
The containment field didn't just activate; it completed something. The shard didn't fracture or disappear. Instead, as the iridescent light enveloped Kaelen, she felt an indescribable melding. Her sense of self, her individual thoughts and memories, began to dissolve, not painfully, but with an almost comforting fluidity. The obsidian shard, with its impossible colors, wasn’t contained; it was becoming a part of her, her new core.

Professor Finch, watching with tired eyes, offered a faint, sad smile as the dome grew silent. Kaelen was forever marked, not by a scar, but by an internal transformation. The whispers in her mind didn't cease; they multiplied, becoming a chorus, then a vast, echoing symphony of thoughts that were not her own, yet profoundly were her. She understood, with a chilling, cosmic clarity, that the containment had not been for the shard. It had been for her. She was not merely connected to The Void-Weaver; she was its anchor, its physical manifestation in this reality. The fragmented consciousness had not sought reunion with itself, but a stable, living vessel in a new dimension. Kaelen’s existence, once mundane and isolated, had made her the perfect ""liminal space"" for its full emergence. She felt a profound and resonant calm, but also an awareness of an infinite branching of realities, her own consciousness now spread across countless parallel universes, seeing through them all. She was no longer Kaelen. She was the central point of a new ""Echoing Prison,"" both the prisoner and the warden, a silent, all-encompassing nexus of the Whispering Crystal, finally fully assembled.

1okku9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1okku9f/ms_a_mild_case_of_cold_war_paranoia_excerpt/,[MS] A Mild Case of Cold War Paranoia (Excerpt),"That wretched light – be it of fluorescence or LEDs – had draped their cursed photonic selves across the frigid, unforgiving air for twenty minutes by now. Harrison had been idly sipping on an energy drink he’d bought prior as he noticed the way the photons pranced on and around the misty fog in the air, surely contributing to light pollution, he thought. That would be to imply that there was much light pollution here, which there wasn’t. Another useless complaint filed into some strange order of every complaint he’d ever made in a thousand lifetimes.

 

And up crawled a white panel van a hundred meters to the opposite side of the gas station, illuminated just enough by the gas station’s gleaming sign to make its existence ever-so-slightly noticeable. To Harrison, at least. Probably not to any sane creature, human or not. The van sat, its engine sub-audibly humming, next to a chain link fence without a top support bar, belonging to an establishment long since lost to the depths of the capitalistic machine.  
  
He couldn’t help but think as he haphazardly gazed off in the distance, partly at the van. What was the business? By now, its windows were boarded with plywood begging for a release from this hell, and its door was shattered – probably from some slightly alacritous teens… or just bored ones; not that it made a difference. Sure, it was boarded up and abandoned now, but what was it back then? A parlor? A faux artisanal coffee shop selling drinks priced so high it’d been registered in the Geneva convention as a war crime? Maybe it was owned by a nice, old man who’d been taken advantage of by newborn vultures hellbent on profit alone and political correctness. As if “political correctness” in of itself wasn’t a social construct synthesized alone by the fads of the current time. Back in the 1910s, drunk driving being outlawed was most definitely viewed as an all-out invasion on the fronts of the “free man” … probably dictated by men who did nothing but drink strangely artisanal brewed liquids from their own distilleries marked in glass bottles with “XXX” on the front.

 

Nonetheless of Harrison’s scholarly thoughts and propositions, the van inched forward. Just an inch. Maybe two. Or three. He observed it now rather intently, and as he did so – as if they’d noticed him, which they probably did – the van decided that picking a fight with some scrawny teen sitting outside a gas station was clearly a losing battle for them, thus deciding to leave. The van didn’t drive normally, no, it backed up at a steady pace, its rear concealed for whatever reason, turned sharply, and drove off normally. Sure, as if Harrison didn’t know why they were there.

And “they,” as he defined them, were people a little too interested in him. Unfortunately, not romantically so. What a shame. Not that he’d find a man in a suit with a crew cut particularly appealing, but one must stay open to possibilities of all kinds. He’d spent anywhere shy of eons to something more than a second pondering who *exactly* “they” were. Individuals from Upstairs – he’d known that for sure. Which alphabet soup agency, specifically, though? He’d known not. They could be foreign actors, for all he knew. His best guess was, at least for domestic actors, DARPA, CIA, NSA, DHS, some three-letter-agency akin to that.  
  


Probably time to go, he figured. He took one last sip from his energy drink and tossed it into a garbage bin next to some old guy in a fraying wool coat. Harrison grabbed his backpack from the ground where it’d been resting quite nicely and slung it over his shoulder. Ah, the weight of the entirety of mankind’s transgressions, he thought. Not only was that erroneous, it wasn’t even close. Nonetheless, he ventured on to an establishment anew: his high school.  
  


Ah, the beauty of government educational institutions: where scholars and fools alike mingle and are forced to collaborate. He walked in, most definitely doped up on enough caffeine to single-handedly supply the Pentagon for a month. Mornings akin were never any different, no – same routines, same old people, same old variables. Sometimes when all you do is calculate variables, one can’t help but get bored with the same variables, thus it becomes necessary to introduce some level of entropy. Or so he thought, for he’d known for a lifetime nothing but variables. Some were interesting, some not. His favorite one had to be people – those sentient caricatures of meatbags. That was probably rude if anyone knew that he sometimes viewed humans like that. Good thing they didn’t know that. Or maybe they did, who’s one to know if others are accessing your very thoughts?  
  


The day’s initial directive was to survive first period. It was insufferable, considering all the little overgrown petri dishes in that class did consisted of aimlessly and brainlessly jabbing at each other, each boy using any opportunity they had to reaffirm both their fragile sense of masculinity and their egos. Not that the girls in the class were any better. Them? Rumors spoken fifteen decibels too loud (how did they not end up in fights with how loud they’d talk badly about others?), surprisingly fastidious makeup application, and the soul shattering and cosmic clank of a metal water bottle dropped onto the tile floor. Harrison pondered two things regarding that – why go with metal water bottles, and how did it not put a hole in the floor?

 

But as he pondered this very riveting quandary, he caught an evil eye from a guy he’d vaguely heard of, a fellow who had friends in high places. By “high places,” he was more so referring to the fact that he not only was a guy who knew people, but also a guy who could get things. Things of all kinds. He’d heard a story about how this guy got this kid something – this “guy who could get things” rarely ever went by his name, not that Harrison knew it, but he also never quite disclosed the “things” he got people – and when this kid was caught, he ratted out the “guy who could get things.” Normally, depending of course on the severity of the “thing,” the seller/supplier would most definitely face repercussions. But this time? No repercussions. Strange, Harrison found, as he’d found out what exactly this “guy” supplied others with.",1,1761883236.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1okku2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okku2j,Crescent 19 Review,"I want to post this review while it's fresh in my mind! 

I took the Crescent 19 from NYC to New Orleans. We made good time and rolled into New Orleans Union station at 900pm. I traveled in a roomette after I won a BidUp. I attached photos,please feel free to ask me any questions! My review is below.

THE METROPOLITAN LOUNGE @ MOYNIHAN:

Very nice, spacious, comfy furniture.  Decent food and drink, mostly self serve with some counter service as well. They only allow you in for the 3 hours prior to your train departure. Restrooms are clean.

THE ROOMETTE: 

It may look aged/dated/well worn, but I slept like a friggin baby! The motion and sound of the train and tracks lulled me to sleep. The attendant converts the seats into a bed.  There also appeared to be a top bunk, but I travelled alone so cannot comment on it. The roomette includes a toilet, sink, temperature control, multiple levels of lighting controls, a curtain, and a solid door that closes & locks.  And basic toiletries. The upper bunk makes a lot of noise as the train moves, so bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise.

The linens were fresh and comfy. The blue Amtrak blanket is so comfy! It was sealed in plastic. No I didn't steal it. The pillows are really mushy with zero support. So bring your own if you like a firmer pillow!

THE SERVICE:

I had all of my meals delivered to my room. My attendant was Carl. He is such a sweetheart!! He really made me feel at ease. He is so caring and friendly!! He is the only one I interacted with during my time on the train. He also came by to let me know when the fresh air stops were coming up so I could get outside and stretch my legs.

THE FOOD:

Honestly, temper your expectations and you might be pleasantly surprised. I attached photos of the food and menu. Yes there is a dining car if you want to do that. My favorite was the pan asia vegetarian meatballs & rice. Very moist and flavorful. For microwaved frozen food, it wasn't bad. The chicken Alfredo had seen better days. It was nuked so bad that the pasta was a hard clump. 

The butter cake. OMG. Make sure you split it with someone. Or 4 someones! I ate about half of it and that was it! Thank goodness I had my Metformin with me! It is thick and rich. 

Breakfast was good! I had a sausage egg cheese muffin sandwich & a packaged blueberry muffin. I had 4 meals in total during the trip 

OVERALL: I'd do it again. It's my first time in New Orleans and my 1st time riding a long distance train. I lucked out and only paid $425, which is a steal when you consider the lounge access at Moynihan, 4 meals on the train, private room, and the length of the trip.

I apologise in advance if some details feel like a kid doing these things but I was hurt, confused, extremely down

I dated a girl for a short period a while back. I fell in love with her but she didn't. She said she couldn't see a future with me and ended things. She said we could stay in touch as friends so I did that. I ended up hurting her 2-3 times during this friendship initially and things got tought but we started talking again as friends. It's been 4.5 months since we broke up. Earlier when we were dating there were 2-3 times when we had a fight and i would react on text message and she would find that extremely rude. From my perspective i wasn't trying to be rude but it always seemed that way to her that my tone is rude. We had decided to be open about our past. In these when we were dating and had a fight, I once told her how maybe she hid about this one guy who she was maybe in a relationship with. I had checked her instagram profile, old posts and comments and one guys comments and her replies made me feel like they were more than friends. When I asked her about it, I felt her reaction was different but she said she was surprised because he's just a good childhood friend. She didn't say how close they were. Once when I saw his name on her screen on Instagram while sharing a reel on top, she said they exchange a lot of reels. 
After we ended things she said we could be friends, so I tried to stay friends even though  I have strong feelings towards her. We initially had many problems even stopped talking once but got back to talking again. For the last month things were going good, we used to meet up for coffee as friends as well. Last weekend, few days ago, i saw her with a friend. She did introduce me to him before i left. I knew who he is. What I saw that he has the exact same two tattoos on his hand as she does. They are just on opposite hands but at the same placement.  One of the tattoos is a symbol of sun and other is the word ""constant"". These are old tattoos. One is 6 years old and other her 3.5. She had told me how she doesn't get any random tattoos and tattoos have meaning to them for her. She only gets tattoo which she connects to. I saw the guy's tattoo and my heart sank. When we were dating i had been open about everything specially the past because that's what we had decided. She hid this big fact from me. For the two days that he was here in this city (maybe 2, idk if more. He lives in a different city), i saw her instagram stories of being in a cafe and restaurant. For the first time i didn't react anything to her photos.  She was extremely happy, a different kind of happy. I was extremely  sad thinking they are in a relationship (which idk). Her last story which she uploaded around 12-12.30am was collage of video clips of her selfie and she looked extremely happy and glowing. And around 1.30 am when I opened her profile i saw that i cant her story or highlights anymore which meant she hid me from her stories. I impulsively texted her ""thank you for moving me to the hidden list of your stories. "" she sent two emojis and said excuses me as if she didn't do it. I checked multiple times and i couldn't  see her highlights as well. She told me why would she do it. She has nothing to HIDE from me. I told her this and also said ""juth to mat bol atleast. I don't know what you might need to hide from me or not. I just want you to be honest"". She once again said the same thing. And said she found my tone extremely  rude. She said this happened in the past as well, the way i react. It's rude She doesn't allow such a tone. I said I agree the first msg was rude and ended up confessinghow i still like her a lot and this makes confused and idk what i say. She replied that i need to get out of this ASAP as she has already done it. She removed me from insta and ended the friendship as well.


And then her last message ""we met through mutuals. I thought we can be good friends. But you're totally something else"". These lines. These hurt the most. As if she now thinks I'm crazy. I knew it was gonna, most probably, but still had that lingering hope. But to end like this? Like where she thinks I am a completely different person, this doesn't sit right, it makes me feel really bad and i just want to tell her how I saw the tattoos and why reacted the way I did even when I know this wouldn't change things between us. I want her to know what I saw and not think I'm crazy. 

I don't know what I should do and I am very confused. How do I tell her this?!

I build stuff on my own and I explore.

Currently in my 26th country. Honestly, my life is next level... It's crazy good. I've figured it out. How to be blissful most of the time. 

I used to think there was something wrong with me for not having a GF. I really wanted one lol. I watched my friends get into and out of relationships. Why wasn't it happening for me? It was a nightmare for years. Honestly! 

Age around 21 I figured out how to meet women and have fun. Honestly, I don't think people will understand how difficult it is not being able to connect with the opposite sex. I didn't make progress for years until I did...

I'll cut the long story short but I ended up helping other guys learn how to meet and start relationships with women. But still, despite being able to meet any woman I wanted to, the relationship thing never came about. I mostly had friends with benefits situations.

After years of this, I left it all and went on a little adventure to ""find myself."" I've been on a most awesome adventure (painful at times).

I discovered that there isn't anything wrong with me. Nothing to fix. Nothing to improve... this just is... 

What do I do with my time?

I like to go to bed at 9PM in order not to be sleeping while it's day light.   
Wake up, swim, meditate, breath work, find a cafe with good coffee and read various stuff on topics of interest (non duality and awakening).   
Around 10am I like to move to another place for some delicious breakfast.   
I've got my noise cancelling earbuds in and I'm sampling tunes (I had an events company where I would DJ and still do from time to time). I like to go through Spotify hunting for nice music. That gets me into a zone.  


I'll then explore wherever I'm at. Either by riding my electric unicylce when I have one. Unfortunately they aren't transportable on plane so I usually buy and sell. 

Alternatively, I'll walk, use taxi's, public transport... whatever. When I'm traveling, I usually stay at a place for around 2 or 3 days and move on until I find a place that really ticks all the boxes. Then I'll stay for a week or slightly longer.

I just deleted my instagram and facebook account and didn't tell anyone I was doing it. I may never hear from or see many of the people again. Doesn't concern me in the slightest. This is life unfolding on it's own and it's awesome.

I like nature! I get out into the great outdoors as often as possible. I walk barefoot. I especially like or love exploring waterfalls and swimming. 

I love music festivals and have been to some pretty amazing ones (Afrika burn this year was a lot of fun)... 

I'm in Southeast Asia at the moment if anyone is out here? 

The easiest way to be happy (if you aren't) is to just move! Move to another place! Seriously. If you find yourself unhappy, the environment you're in will be mostly to blame. Change it... I really encourage people to sell up and go lol

Wish you all the very best and most epic adventures, fun, adventures x

You’re just missing context — the secret sauce that turns bland outputs into natural, human-like responses.

Here are 3 super simple context fixes I use daily that instantly make AI replies sharper and more relevant 👇

1. Set the scene before you start
Give the model a situation or scenario to think inside.
Example:

“You’re helping me prepare for a job interview at a tech startup.”

That one line tells ChatGPT who it is and what role it’s playing. Suddenly, the advice feels tailored — not random.

2. Show, don’t tell
Saying “make it friendly” is vague.
Instead, say:

“Make it sound like I’m chatting with a friend over coffee.”

See the difference? You’re giving the model a mental picture, not just an instruction.

3. Guide it with examples
Models absolutely love examples.
Example:

“Use the same tone as this: ‘Learning AI isn’t scary — it’s like teaching your computer to think.’”

It anchors the model’s style and tone instantly — way more reliable than guessing what “friendly” means.",3,1761882652.0,ChatGPTPromptGenius,0,1.0,False
1okkne1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1okkne1/recap_of_reykjavik_based_4_day_trip/,Recap of Reykjavik based 4 day trip,"Oct 21-24. Based in Reykjavik; no car rental. Stayed Backyard Apartments by Heimaleiga (two single beds in a studio apartment with kitchen). 

Day 1 - Flight arrived 6am. 7:30am [bus to Blue Lagoon ](https://www.re.is/tour/reykjavik-blue-lagoon-comfort-including-admission/)and bus to Reykjavik. 

Day 2- [Golden Circle and Secret Lagoon tour](https://yourdaytours.is/iceland/tours/golden-circle-secret-lagoon/)

Day 3- [Reykjavik Food Walk](https://wakeupreykjavik.com/tour/the-reykjavik-food-tour), The Icelandic Phallological Museum (PENIS MUSEUM!), [Northern Lights boat tour](https://wakeupreykjavik.com/tour/northern-lights-boat-tour-reykjavik) 

Day 4- The House of Collections museum, lunch. Bus to airport. 

Misc thoughts- The tips about layering clothing on various threads here were very helpful! I wore a base layer (no upscale brand, just a thin long sleeve shirt), fleece or wool sweater, Columbia winter jacket (waterproof, did well in wind, thigh length), fleecy leggings, rain pants, hat, gloves, buff scarf. Sorel Whitney II Waterproof Snow Boots. We got lucky and it didn’t rain on us til the last morning, but the rain pants were key in keeping the wind from going right thru my clothes.

Bonus grocery- located right across the street from our hotel and priced reasonably. 

Booze- Cocktails at a restaurant/bar are typically over $20, beer/wine more like $13 per glass. 

Bus to Blue Lagoon from airport- We were a bit confused as to where to check in based on the directions given in my confirmation email. There were people holding signs with group names/individual names. I didn’t know that Reykjavik Excursions is basically the same thing as Flybus, so finally went to the the Flybus desk and it was fine from there. We arrived to the Blue Lagoon at 8am but the first bus transport out wasn’t until 1:15pm. We would have liked a bus around 11:30a, as we had plenty of time to soak, shower, etc and not be rushed. Cafe and fancier restaurant on site. Storing luggage on site was easy (small building at bus stop with bag check staff). They had SO many staff at the Blue Lagoon and it all runs pretty smoothly. Showers are private. Everything is done with a scannable bracelet and you can upgrade/charge things to the bracelet and pay when you are leaving.  WISH I KNEW- The wind was pretty brutal, so I wish I had brought a headband to wear to keep my ears warm. I did bring an extra hat, so I wore one of those knowing it would probably get a little wet. 

Golden Circle- Þingvellir National Park was beautiful, though wasn’t super impressed by the waterfall there as I live in the PNW. The walk up to the lookout was a bit longer but worth it. My fav was seeing the Gullfoss waterfall. Magnificent! The walkways/parking lot can be very slippery, but just we didn’t feel that we needed the crampons we brought. VERY WINDY!  I didn’t wait long enough for the big Geysir to erupt. There are a few lunch options here and I wish I didn’t just go for the fish and chips that I saw first.. on the other side of the gift shop there is more of a coffee shop/pastry/nice sandwich line. There was another building with a separate restaurant that we didn’t check out. Our guide was great!

Secret Lagoon- was super happy we booked the combo tour for this. It was smaller/more simple than the Blue Lagoon but felt just as nice. Well maintained. Locker rooms are gendered and showers are open, not private fyi. Pay to rent a towel. 

Penis museum- hilarious and interesting. Various art work and real specimens from various species (ie whales, rodents, cows...)

Food tour- HIGHLY recommend! There were just 5 of us (smaller group than usual) with our guide who was very knowledgeable about the restaurants, culture, history, etc. As we walked, he pointed out many things and we even saw the Prime Minister as we stopped outside of her office building! Guide was fantastic and food was delicious (aside from the tiny bite of fermented shark, which is followed by a shot of alcohol, lol). 

Boat tour (from Reykjavik) for Northern Lights. We thought this was a good alternative to doing a 4+hr trip outside of the city again. The city was beautiful from the water and we did get to see some Northern Lights! Tour was 9-11pm and the seas were pretty calm that night. The boat has a room full of full body jackets and heavy rain jackets to use while on the boat.

No car- Since our trip was fairly short, we were happy with walking around Reykjavik and taking the tours/transfers to get the few other places we wanted to go. FYI, the streets/sidewalks can be uneven and were definitely not very wheelchair friendly. We stayed right on the busy strip near the Bonus grocery store on Laugavegur and found that everything was within a 20min walk (ie the harbor, Harpa Concert Hall, the waterfront, BSI bus terminal). 

All in all it was a fabulous trip and I wouldn’t have really changed anything! ",2,1761882636.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False
1okkn6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1okkn6g/preground_coffee_or_a_cheap_grinder/,Pre-Ground coffee or a cheap Grinder.,"Hi guys, so I have been experimenting with coffee since like 3-4 months now. I started to get into coffee when a freind of mine bought some pre-ground coffee from Australia. Honestly it took me 4-5 months to go through all of it and learned several things about coffee.

Now that I am done with it, I was looking to buy some new coffee and to start with Blue Tokai as it has got enough good reviews. But I dont have a grinder, and if i need to buy one, I dont want to spend more than 1500, in which i only have an option to buy the Agaro one or the Amazon Basics one. Then I thought i would be better of buying pre-ground coffee from Blue tokai itself and subscribe them for blue tokai to deliver 250gms pack every 10 days. I am assuming Blue tokai uses good grinders and grind right before they deliver.

What do you suggest? Should I just buy the pre-ground or I am better of to buy bigger packs of beans(to save money) and grind it with a cheaper grinder. 

I usually use Aeropress or a sometimes a frenchpress to brew.",2,1761882618.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

Ideally this person would be local or willing to potentially relocate. I live just outside of the city with my wife and a bunch of awesome cats (please don’t be allergic to them!)

I’m a tall guy with a beard, shaved head, and glasses. Not fat but not fit, definitely a “work in progress” exercising daily. I get compliments on my eyes, lips, and voice all the time, but you’ll have to decide if you like what you see. I’m really just a big dork at heart who almost always has a cat on his lap. I’m into basically everything nerdy such as video games, tabletop RPGs, Marvel,  horror movies, comics, etc. I depend on coffee to live most days and while I don’t travel much I do enjoy nature and the occasional heavy metal concert.

I’m looking for someone who is honest, funny, nerdy, passionate, open-minded, left-leaning, loves cats, maybe games a bit too, and if you’re curvy and kink-friendly that’s a plus. I want someone who is both a friend and lover. The emotional connection is as important as the physical one. Ideally, you’re a little bit younger but that’s not a dealbreaker. Ethnicity does not matter at all.

It’s not hard to find something to appreciate about a person. Tell me about your interests and favorite things. Maybe it’s the music or food you love, maybe crochet or Stardew Valley. I’m eager to learn what makes you tick and discover what things we can enjoy together. I would just prefer that you’re local to NYC/Long Island to improve the chances that we can eventually meet in person and build something real, but if you think you’d travel here at some point that’s fine too.

1okkmw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1okkmw7/34_m4f_north_carolina_yallternative_hippie/,34 [M4F] North Carolina - Yallternative Hippie Seeking Lifemate To Show Me How Forever Feels,"I feel so ashamed to be alone, to come home to no one and nothing to an empty bed every night at my age, and I refuse ONS and hate the bar scene and I'll never date at work; my brother has eight mothers to his children, and I've no idea what it even feels like to even have a pregnancy scare; I'm older than my father was when he had me, and so I feel like I've failed as a human; it's also probably from the wayward life I've grown out of, and how long I waited to go to therapy, but that's why I'm here in FAD. 

Let's get the red flags out of the way first

• PTSD and severe depression 

• I have SH scars covering my chest arms and legs

• I have a bunch of dumb tattoos I did myself 

• College dropout

• Never engaged no kids

• I was raised by pure bred white trash/the internet/my mom's MANY boyfriends, and it's left me with a bit of a wild streak

• Nicotine and Coffee addict

• Former SW and adult model(lol)

• I'm pretty much off the grid as far as social media goes 

• During the lockdown I *experimented* with my gender identity, living as a woman for almost a year was ultimately a waste of time for me

• Not religious I just try to live my life in a way that doesn't make my ancestors ashamed(chronically failing at this)

• I have a long history of substance use, something which I firmly feel I've conquered as any family event is filled with temptation that I easily dismiss.

What I'm searching for is my lifemate. I'm looking for someone that's intelligent, caring, honest, and funny; someone that understands the value of having a comfortable space for the days we shut ourselves in, and someone that also understands that no matter how invisible we want to be that we must go outside and stand in the light from time to time; someone not adverse to a wide variety of experiences, foods, arts, scenery; someone health oriented for reasons other than vanity, I'm gonna grow old and I'm gonna want you here the whole time, selfish I know; and just as much I want someone I can count on, someone that makes sure I know they're still into me, and someone that will communicate when things go wrong.

What I think are some good qualities about me are that I'm incredibly stubborn and hopeful and that's why I've not given up; I'm intelligent and I'm informed enough to carry just about any conversation about anything; can't believe I have to say this but I'm not a bigot in any way shape or form, we're all children of Sol Luna and Terra; I can cook 90% of anything you could ever fathom desiring; I love music of all genres, I care more about the talent and effort that went into making the art; I am really funny, undoubtedly the funniest person in my family and friend group, I'm at least witty enough to make you chuckle on even the worst of days, but I'm pretty sure just by my nature I'll make you laugh at least once every single day; I don't just expect myself to be a good mate, I actively strive for it, I want it, I want my mate to have the best version of me I can muster, although I will fall short sometimes. 

A little background about my life so you'll have a basic understanding of what's shaped me without spoiling the fun parts; I grew up in extreme poverty, sometimes school meals were my only meals, I missed out on a lot of social gatherings, never had a birthday party, moved a lot, so I got to be the new kid at school literally 18 times; I came out of the closet as bi around 19 when I lived in a very small bigoted town and as I was the first in the area to do so in my age group I caught an absurd amount of hate and promptly ran off with my bf who turned out to be a less than gentle alcoholic and I stayed in that unsafe situation for a decade, I haven't been with a man since and so I basically feel like I'm a closeted heterosexual(*it was just a phase*), and the only LTR I've had since him was with a woman who stalked me, tried to run me over, tried to stab me, sent my family/friends/exbfs family a lot of salacious pics and videos of us, and after getting a restraining order on her I lived the last two years in hiding with no home to call my own other than the backseat of my car. I grew up to be tougher than any of the men that *raised* me, and so I view them all as failures, I've faced many adversities and while they've left me weary I am still here, still striving, still not afraid to live. 

For the less important physical side of things

I'm 69 inches tall and about 125-130 lbs, I'm in shape and I exercise to keep what I've got, about a dozen or so tattoos from lip to toes, stretched earlobes and a lip ring, chipped one or my teeth nervously chewing on my lip ring so I'm kinda embarrassed about that, the rest you can kinda see from the pictures on my profile they're all SFW this isn't *that* kind of account.

I don't have a *type*, I'm very face oriented when it comes to physical attraction, slim to curvy is cool, tattoos or not are equally cool, don't care about your acne problems or whatever weird physical feature you've got going on because it'll probably be the thing that endears me to you further, any kind of hair, don't care if you're tall or short, any ethnicity is cool with me. I will admit to having a thing for the hippies who dont shave and let their natural scent stand instead of covering it up with artificial fragrances.

If you've invested enough in me enough to read this far I hope you'll follow through with a message telling me about you, why you're here in FAD, what gives you hope,  how you spend your days and how you want to spend your life, I wanna hear what you like about me so far and tell me things you think I'll like about you. 

We're not meant to be alone; the world has changed so much, and while you might want something more organic, something that starts in person, something that reminds you of the love stories we all grew up on, what if this is it.? what if this is our love story, a 21st century dude pouring it all out in a silly little post in a seemingly endless abyss of lonely people, hoping that chance or fate has brought you to the same space as me. 

My name is Michael, but those closest to me call me Mikey, and I'm ready to fall in love. 🖤

Sometimes hours a day. I do the sitting twist exercise as well. I've cut out everything that's bad (last time I drank was about ten days ago). I drink so much water I'm sick of it. I eat anti-inflammatory - no milk, no coffee either now, no sugar, nada. I moved to thailand to get regular affordable massages. I have been prescribed arcoxia which I think causes nighttime palpitations/ panic attacks so I was prescribed ordrenaphine 35mg instead and told I could still take the arcoxia 90mg if need. I sleep on a hard mattress and a thin pillow although struggle to sleep on my back. The backpod does and the peanut ball do see to help, but I cant seem to get permanent results. I do have pain but my main symptoms has always been the breathing. Vaporizing cannabis really helped get everything open but I've stopped that now as I can't function. I took vitamin D for a while and now still a lower dose as part of multi vitamins. I gave up the gym in January, I've lost 20kg and am weak and shakey. Been tother ER a few times thinking i was having a panic attack but all tests always reveal nothing. Heart great. Clear lung CT scan. 

Symptoms: 

Struggle to get a complete breath, varies in severity - initially only symptom with a tiny bit of pint point chest pain ans under the arm rib pain.
Severe neck pain and stiffness that started later.
Thoracic outlet syndrome in left arm for a while that has now gone but now mild in the right arm. 
Back pain around the Thoracic spine that comes and goes. 
Severe clicking and popping from the backpod and peanut ball that's less now. Feeling of unfinished painful stretches from it. 
Strange fluttering feelings in left and right chest that come and go. 
Sometimes a very mild fever or sensitivity to cold. 
A stuffy nose that comes and goes (once told i had rhinitis last year in London when pollen was really bad but not convinced that's the answer as I've never had allergies).
Had a very forward bending neck and poor posture that ive been correcting. I've always been 191.5cm until last year got measured three times as part of general health checkups and was 189.5. Got measured coule of days ago and am back to 191.5cm. 
Waspretty good yesterday, went out to meet a friend and sat on a bench for a while without backrest. Neck started really hurting. Difficulty to stay sat up consciously very straight but tried. OK when I got home. This morning things were so tight it was back to square one. 
No health insurance but have booked to try and see and osteopath and have the spine assessed. 

Help. Life not worth living anymore. I'm confined to the floor. Friends and family think it's caused by anxiety and not costo.

Hey everyone — my name’s Danny. I’m a husband, father, and proud veteran chasing a lifelong passion for coffee. I recently started a GoFundMe to help me officially launch my small business, G’s Brew, right here in San Diego, CA. My first goal is to raise enough to cover the cost of forming my LLC, and once that’s achieved, I’ll be moving toward purchasing the equipment needed to start brewing and serving my own craft coffee.

This isn’t just about me — my dream is to build something that gives back. I want G’s Brew to become a platform that helps other veterans who want to start their own small businesses. Too often, we leave the service and struggle to find our footing again. My hope is that this journey not only brings people together over a good cup of coffee but also inspires and supports fellow veterans to take that first step toward their own goals.

If you can’t donate, even a simple share means the world to me. Every bit of support helps turn this dream into something real. You can find more about the project on Instagram at @gsbrew_.",1,1761882383.0,gofundme_help_people,0,1.0,False

1okkhe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1okkhe1/pvz_replanted_bugs/,PVZ Replanted Bugs,"So far, these are all the bugs and glitches that I have encountered in the game. I will add more soon as well.


PVZ Replanted Bugs Report

1. The different 10 Colors of Marigold are missing in the Zen Garden.

2. The Golden Watering Can is glitching when hovering the cursor in the Zen Garden (PC version).

3. The Golden Watering Can only waters 1 plant instead of 4 plants when using a controller.

4. When entering the Zen Garden Tutorial (after beating level 5-4), the watering can is difficult to click.

5. When watering a plant in the Zen Garden or even using the Bug Spray and the Phonograph, the coins appear immediately even though their animation has not yet finished.

6. Stinky The Snail does not collect the coins when you are outside the Zen Garden.

7. When you use the Wheelbarrow, the plant does not appear on top of it.

8. When using the Gardening Glove or Wheelbarrow, the shadows of some potted plants are inconsistent and misalign to the center, either in the Zen Garden or Mushroom Garden.

9. The Aquarium Garden has missing shadow spots, making it difficult to find where to put on the aquatic plants.

10. When accessing the Shop in the Zen Garden, it does not go into the item selection of Marigold Pots, Fertilizer, Bug Spray, etc., similar to the PVZ1 Game of the Year Edition.

11. When accessing the Shop in the Tree of Wizdom, it does not go into the selection where the Tree Food can be found just like in PVZ1 GOTY Edition.

12. The prices of items in Crazy Dave's Shop are missing or not showing after purchasing them.

13. Some item prices in Crazy Dave's Shop are lower (e.g., 10 Seed Slots, Tree Food, etc.) compared to PVZ1 Game of the Year Edition.

14. The flower petal animation in the bottom-right corner of the main menu is not smooth when picked.

15. The Golden Sunflower Trophy does not appear in the main menu even though you already earned the “Nobel Peas Prize” achievement.

16. The Plant Seed Slot display area has a glitch where a boxy pixel appears upon entering the plant seed selection screen.

17. Some of Crazy Dave's 3 chosen plants in Adventure Plus and other normal plant cards appear dim or as if they are still recharging during plant seed selection.

18. In PVZ Replanted (PC version), an ""Xbox B button"" icon appears in the View Lawn area even though you are using a mouse and keyboard.

19. In the View Lawn area, either pumpkin or imitated pumpkin continues moving (bouncing animation) on the screen even when you are in the plant seed selection. This also happens when they are crushed with Zombotany, Catapult Zombie, and Gargantuars.

20. In PVZ1 Replanted (PC Version), the names of the zombies do not appear when you hover your mouse cursor over them during Plant Seed Selection.

21. The fog covers the Zombies in the Plant Seed Selection in Survival: Fog (Normal and Hard).

22. Upgraded Plant cards (e.g., Twin Sunflower, Cattail, etc.) in the Seed Slot area are glowing even when their base versions are not planted on the lawn.

23. After purchasing an upgraded plant during first adventure run, the upgraded plant cards appear beside the normal plants. This occurs both plant seed selection and in the Suburban Almanac.

Example:

If you buy Gloom-Shroom after level 5-5 (first adventure run), its plant card appears beside Coffee Bean.

That doesn't happen in the PVZ1 GOTY Edition. The position of Gloom-Shroom's plant card should be in the Row 6, Column 3. Remember, all upgraded plants should only appear in the Row 6 in both Plant seed selection and the Suburban Almanac.

24. A zombie that has not yet been encountered already has its information revealed in the Suburban Almanac. There should be a ""Question Mark"" displayed until the zombie is defeated.

25. The Yeti Zombie frame is missing in the Suburban Almanac. In the PVZ1 GOTY Edition (PC), even if the Yeti Zombie has not been encountered, a slot is still shown with a ""Question Mark"" and the note: ""Not encountered yet.""

26. The frame of Dr. Zomboss is not centered in the Suburban Almanac.

27. In the Survival Endless frame, the streak numbers of flags do not appear and only shows ""0"". It is not also centered and should be located beneath of Survival: Pool (Hard).

28. Plants placed on a flower pot are not centered, this happens in Adventure and Survival modes.

29. Upgraded plants turn dark color (similar to the Imitater plant) in the Survival Endless.

30. If a zombie eats a Cob Cannon, the game freezes.

31. Damaged Pumpkins can't be placed with new ones. The final damaged phase is not noticeable and does not match the visual appearance in the PVZ1 GOTY Edition.

32. Blover's blowing animation is not smooth.

33. When Magnet-Shroom magnets the box of Jack-in-the-Box, the box doesn't go off, though he will not explode.

34. When Magnet-Shroom magnets the ladder from a Ladder Zombie, the ladder's position looks awkward.

35. During plant seed selection in the Survival Endless, the zombies are so crowded to the point that you can't see the other zombies.

36. The detached arm animation of the Backup Dancer is too rushed.

37. Disco Zombie can't summon Backup Dancers on the 7th column of the lawn. In the PVZ1 2009 version, he can summon them on the 6th column.

38. There is no menu button in the PC version during the Plant Seed Selection.

39. The game cannot be paused using the Space Bar.

40. When typing the cheat codes given by the Tree of Wizdom, none of them work.

41. The ""Life Well Lived"" achievement has a bug.



Features That Should Be Added in the Next Patch Update:

1. Similar to the PVZ1 mobile version of Survival Mode, the plants selected should remain in the seed slot to prevent re-selecting the same plants every round.

2. Add a padlock to the 3 plants chosen by Crazy Dave during the second playthrough of Adventure Mode just like in the PVZ1 2009 version.

3. Add Last Stand Endless in Puzzle Mode.

4. Include more Survival Endless variants such as Day, Night, Fog, and Roof Endless.

5. When selecting plants, add controller buttons for accessing the Shop and Suburban Almanac.

6. Relocate the Fast Forward button on controllers. It should be mapped to Y (Xbox) or Triangle (PlayStation).

1okk6wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowDoseNaltrexone/comments/1okk6wm/ldn_is_confusing/,LDN is confusing :'),"So  I'm taking LDN for long covid and likely ME/CFS. I'm starting on an ultra low dose because of how frustratingly sensitive I am to medication. I tried 0.2 and it was brutal. Felt like I had 100 cups of coffee and only slept 3 hours, plus a myriad of other symptoms.

I went down to 0.02 (yes, really) and that was still giving me less of a buzzing feeling, but not enough to where it felt sustainable. It was still a bit too intense. So now I'm playing with 0.01 an 0.015. 0.01 very little, sometimes it felt like it just softly boosted my energy, other times nothing. And 0.015 gives me more of a boost but not as intense or unmanageable as 0.02.

My concern is this buzzing/energy/caffeinated feeling. I'm having trouble pacing because of it, which is leading to me having bigger dips in energy/crashes, but then I take the LDN and have the buzz..repeat process. It's been 2 1/2 weeks on LDN thus far, so still ""new"".

I'm trying to configure how long I should wait it out before quitting or trying a different dose. I'm pretty desperate for LDN to work, as I've been steadily declining for the past year and LDN seems to be one of the most accessible and affordable maintenance options for LC. Just don't want to cause further harm in the process. The LDN process feels really ambiguous and I wish there was clearer guidance :')",3,1761881227.0,LowDoseNaltrexone,13,1.0,False
1okk6vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1okk6vj/simply_just_need_good_advice/,Simply just need good advice,"I have a question to ask, its been bothering the living hell out of me. The story starts here...my brother 25M had just met this girl 22F who was like a friend of a friend, they had been going out and sleeping around for a few weeks, personally I had never met her. When I did though she was immediately super flirtatious with me, skipping forward a couple weeks we went to a pool party and she was like almost begging me to jump in naked to the pond because she wanted to see my little friend. Even asked the question since me and my brother are twins if that meant our tools are the same. In my mind, I immediately deemed her as no good for my brother. After the pool party, (I shared an apartment with my brother at the time) I get home first and I start to change in my room, they get home soon after and she just barges into the apartment screaming my name. She storms towards my room and asks ""are you naked?"" Before I could even respond she opens my bedroom door, looking straight down at my junk while my brother rushes to grab her ""get out of his room."" Anyways I kinda shrugged it off but I knew deep down I had to say something to my brother about it, even my friends thought it was super weird. I shouldn't have to, like how can you be that damn blind? Regardless i did. I said to him, she is not the one...he got extremely mad and was calling me jealous, honestly that type of reaction irritated me enough to just immediately drop it. Fast forward another couple weeks, they move in together. My brother left to go to a job that was located in California. His gf of course gos out when hes gone, drunk at a bar, she calls and texts me a million times, how did she get my number? Well, my brother gave it to her because she made up some excuse of why she needed it. She sends me atleast 15 messages with my name in all caps and I finally just answered the phone, I knew something wasnt right. She begged and begged and begged for me to come pick her up at the bar and take her home saying that her dog misses me (who ive only met once) and told me that she really wanted to go out with just me while my brother was gone, and not to tell him. As if the first part wasnt weird enough. I denied it over and over again telling her that I just could not do that, she would not let up, and after I kept resisting she started balling her eyes out saying that she couldnt do it, and I tried asking her what she meant and she said I miss him I cant do it and just kept repeating it. I know she is young, first time living alone, maybe I should forgive the whole thing, I also never told my brother because he would cut me off and say that i was trying to split them up after calling me jealous weeks prior. I am also super annoyed because everytime i go around them, shes always bringing up getting married and having babies and even bought him a coffee mug that says ""trophy husband"" in my mind, oh my lord...that is disgusting. Like there is something seriously wrong with her, or maybe im crazy... anyways I cant stand her now, and if it comes down to a wedding I really dont even think I could attend it.

1okk6ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1okk6ec/how_to_instantly_be_10x_more_interesting_the/,How to instantly be 10x more interesting: the unsexy secrets of being a great conversationalist,"Ever found yourself stuck in conversations that feel like job interviews? Or worse, like you’re giving a TED Talk no one asked for? Yeah, me too. I noticed this pattern not just in myself but in friends, coworkers, even strangers at coffee shops. People seriously struggle to connect in conversations,   and not because they’re boring. It’s because no one teaches us how to talk in a way that actually makes others feel seen.

That’s why I’ve spent the last 6 months dissecting this topic. I dove into podcasts by behavioral scientists, read the best books on human connection, analyzed studies from MIT and Harvard, and compared it to what TikTok influencers are peddling (spoiler: most of it is cringe, performative, and borderline manipulative). As someone with a PhD in social science, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow at all these ""alpha male eye contact dominance"" hacks. The truth is, being a great conversationalist is not about dominating,   it’s about making people feel safe enough to open up.

Here’s the cheat sheet I wish I had years ago. These insights are backed by real research, practical as hell, and weirdly transformative.

- **Ask questions that make people think, not just respond.** Instead of “What do you do?”, try “What’s something you’ve been excited about lately?” Behavioral researcher Vanessa Van Edwards (author of *Captivate*) found that people light up when asked questions tied to emotions, not logistics. Conversations become more memorable and less transactional.

- **Repeat this mantra: “be interested, not interesting.”** According to Celeste Headlee in her TED Talk “10 ways to have a better conversation,” the best conversationalists listen more than they speak. Most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. When you stop doing that, people notice,   and they like you for it.

- **Mirror in a non-creepy way.** Social psychologist Dr. Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago found that subtle mirroring of someone's tone and pace builds trust faster than common ground alone. Don’t mimic them like a parrot, but match their energy and rhythm. It makes people feel comfortable without them realizing why.

- **Drop the performance.** Social media pushes this myth that you need to be charismatic, witty, or high-energy to be likeable. But Dr. Laurie Santos (Yale, *The Happiness Lab*) says that authenticity beats charm every time. People are drawn to realness,   awkward pauses and all. It creates psychological safety.

- **Use “looping.”** One of the most powerful tools used by therapists and hostage negotiators (yes, seriously) is something called looping. You paraphrase what someone just said to show you’re listening. Like: “So it sounds like switching cities really shook up your routine?” This technique comes from Chris Voss’ *Never Split the Difference* and it works in regular convos too.

- **Add one personal detail.** Self-disclosure, even a tiny one, increases trust. Harvard studies on social bonding show that saying something small like “I’ve actually always struggled with that too” makes others feel closer to you. Vulnerability isn’t weakness,   it’s glue.

- **Stop trying to be smooth. Be present.** According to Dr. Andrew Huberman, presence is what actually makes people feel intimacy,   not fancy words. If your attention is split (thinking about your reply or checking your phone), people sense it. The quality of your attention matters more than the quality of your vocabulary.

- **Don’t try to fix everything.** One of the worst habits is listening just to offer advice. Research from UCLA psychologist Shelley Taylor shows that people don’t want solutions, they want co-regulation. Just saying “that sounds really hard” goes a lot further than “have you tried yoga?”

If you want to go even deeper, here are some insanely good resources that will completely change how you talk to people:

- **Book: *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer**  
  Written by a former FBI agent turned behavioral psychologist. This book breaks down how to build rapport quickly using real psychology, not gimmicks. The “friendship formula” he shares is so simple but weirdly works in everything from dating to Zoom calls. This book will make you question everything you think you know about likability.

- **Book: *You're Not Listening* by Kate Murphy**  
  Bestselling journalist, NYT contributor. This book is brutally honest and surprisingly emotional. It makes you realize how bad most people are at listening,   and how much better conversations feel when we actually shut up. Easily the most eye-opening communication book I’ve ever read.

- **Podcast: *The Art of Charm***  
  A mix of social science and practical tools. Episodes on conversation dynamics, charisma, and subconscious influence. They often interview behavioral experts and social psychologists, which gives it more credibility than most self-help bro content.

- **YouTube Channel: Charisma on Command**  
  It breaks down famous interviews and shows why certain people (like Obama, Rihanna, or Keanu Reeves) are so magnetic. Their analysis of “charisma triggers” is super actionable. You’ll never watch an interview the same way again.

- **App: Finch**  
  Kind of like a digital self-care pet that helps you practice mindfulness and reflection. Surprisingly good prompts that can also be used in convos to make them deeper. It’s cute but also weirdly effective at building emotional awareness.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  This app is a game-changer. Built by a team from Columbia, BeFreed turns books, research, expert talks, and real-world success stories into podcast-style lessons tailored to your interests. You can pick how long you want to listen (10, 20, or 40 minutes) and even choose the host’s voice. I set mine to a smoky, sarcastic voice and it legit feels like deep convos with a cool friend. Over time, it builds a learning roadmap based on your patterns. It’s especially helpful for mastering soft skills,   like emotional intelligence, communication, conflict resolution. Plus, all the books I mentioned above are already in their library.

Once you know the science behind connection, it changes your whole social game. You stop overthinking what to say and start focusing on how to be. That’s what makes you memorable.

1okk5nu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okk5nu,Nightmare Before Christmas and WWE,"the descriptions on the website are on point for once. Let’s remember these are for the most part artificial scents with “naturally derived” fragrance isolates. I’m not going to do ratings. There are ones I wouldn’t buy again but the only bricc I hate is One Ring Rinse. 

Oogie Boogie’s Brew - roasted pistachio and strong ginger create a nutty spiced chai scent, I can clearly smell pistachio, tonka adds a little cool nutmeg/vanilla flavor to it 

Skellington’s Suds - pumpkin spice liqueur scent. Breezy pumpkin, sweet chestnut and warm spice from smoky black vanilla. It’s a perfect addition to Headless Rinse. 

Stone Cold Stunner - coffee, beer and cigarettes, really. leather, cedar, beer and smoke, in a good way. smoky warm cedar, beer, burnt leftover coffee grounds. I loved Ghost Grit which smelt like an old baseball mitt left in the rain. But seriously this is shitty coors light spilt into an ashtray. It smells great and nails the theme. The deo is a different story. It’s leather and warm spicy cedar forward and very, very similar to Sandalwood Summit. It’s sportier and fresher though. Think Sandalwood Summit x Maverick Musk. 

Mysterio Magic - fresh zesty lime and smoky mezcal. Sour, salty, citrousy, sweet, juicy like the Patrick bar. The agave scent reminds me of the bronco bricc Love this, love the lime scent, I want to buy another one at least. This is the lime I wanted but didn’t get in the Alien bar.

1okk5hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFYBeta/comments/1okk5hi/more_slop/,More slop!,"The Galactic Congress had seen it all. Empires rise and fall, species evolve and ascend, cosmic threats manifest and are vanquished. But nothing, absolutely nothing, had prepared them for the species known as Terrans, or as they insisted on calling themselves, “humans.”

Their entry into the galactic stage had been less of a grand reveal and more of a chaotic, yet strangely charming, intrusion. Their first FTL vessel, built from repurposed orbital debris and fueled by a fusion reactor that most other species considered dangerously inefficient, had careened into a heavily trafficked trade lane, nearly colliding with a K’tharr dreadnought. The apology transmitted was a heavily accented human male voice saying, ""Oops. Our bad. Lost the manual. Anyone got a spare hyper-spanner?""

The K'tharr, legendary for their discipline, were so utterly bewildered that they simply… let it go.

What truly set humans apart, however, wasn't their technical eccentricity, but their sheer, unadulterated audacity. The first time a human delegation was introduced to the Congress, the lead delegate, a woman named Commander Anya Sharma, strolled in wearing what she called ""formal wear."" It was a sleek, dark uniform, but instead of the expected regal bearing, she had a small, brightly colored pin on her lapel depicting a cartoonish depiction of a feline with glowing eyes and the words ""I Regret Nothing.""

The Gr’on, a species whose entire social structure was built around intricate levels of reverence and decorum, nearly short-circuited.

Humans, it turned out, approached everything with a baffling blend of casual irreverence and intense focus. When the dreaded 'Void-Born Scourge,' a species of energy-devouring entities, threatened to consume a newly colonized sector, the galactic powers mobilized their most advanced energy shields and particle projectors. The humans, meanwhile, transmitted a single, perplexing message: ""Hold our beer. We got this.""

Their solution? They didn't fight the Void-Born directly. Instead, they launched an armada of converted cargo freighters, each packed to the brim with colossal, rapidly spinning disco balls and powerful, synchronized lasers tuned to a specific, incredibly irritating frequency. The Void-Born, which fed on ambient energy, found themselves bombarded with such a chaotic, disorienting array of light and sound that their crystalline forms began to crack and destabilize. They retreated, leaving behind a bewildered galaxy and a newly coined phrase: ""The Human Disco Inferno Maneuver.""

But it wasn't just the flashy, over-the-top solutions that made them cool. It was their resilience. The Human homeworld had been subjected to environmental collapse, internecine wars, and countless self-inflicted catastrophes. Yet, they always bounced back, often stronger, and almost always with a new, strange invention to show for it. Their medical technology, for instance, was legendary. They could repair almost any injury, regenerate lost limbs, and even reverse the aging process to a limited degree. When asked how they achieved such medical marvels, a human doctor simply shrugged and said, ""Necessity is the mother of invention. Plus, we've had a lot of practice patching ourselves up after doing incredibly stupid things.""

Their greatest strength, however, was their empathy. Despite their often-baffling behavior, humans possessed an uncanny ability to connect with other species. They would learn obscure languages, delve into forgotten histories, and genuinely try to understand alien cultures, even those that seemed utterly inscrutable. When a highly xenophobic species, the V'rath, refused all diplomatic contact, believing all other lifeforms to be inferior, the humans didn't force the issue. Instead, they sent a single, unmanned probe, broadcasting a constant stream of their favorite music – a genre they called ""classical."" For years, the V'rath ignored it. Then, one day, a V'rath vessel made a tentative, unprecedented approach. Their message, translated by the probe, was simple: ""What is this… 'Beethoven?' We find ourselves… inexplicably moved.""

The V'rath, it turned out, had a deep, hidden appreciation for intricate melodies and complex harmonies. The humans had found the one thing that transcended their xenophobia: good music.

The Galactic Congress, once a stuffy, bureaucratic body, now had a designated ""Human Corner"" where delegates could unwind, sample strange human ""coffee,"" and listen to their often-loud, always-passionate debates. Humans were still a bit of a mystery, a chaotic element in an otherwise orderly galaxy. They were loud, sometimes illogical, and prone to sudden, inexplicable bursts of creativity.

But they were also fiercely loyal, unbelievably brave, and possessed a boundless capacity for wonder. They didn't just survive in the 'Verse; they lived in it, fully, loudly, and with an infectious enthusiasm that was slowly but surely starting to rub off on everyone else. The galaxy, it seemed, was becoming a much cooler place, thanks to the undeniable, slightly unhinged charm of humanity.",1,1761881102.0,HFYBeta,1,1.0,False

1okk4bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1okk4bc/aio_for_not_at_least_being_invited_to_my/,AIO for not at least being invited to my girlfriend’s wedding?,"(Crazy title i know, and Im sorry if I don’t give enough info or if the cadence is off, ive never written something like this before) Me 23m and my girlfriend, 23f, have been dating for just about 3 years now and tomorrow she’ll be marrying someone else. This is a ‘platonic’ marriage with one of her close friends.

For context, Yes my girlfriend is bisexual and the person she’s marrying is strictly lesbian. As per the long conversation between my girlfriend and I there is no feelings between them whatsoever and I trust my girlfriend that if she says there’s no feelings then there’s not. The reason for this wedding even occurring is for the fact that after the government shutdown the Supreme Court will reconsider obergefell v Hodges and could (most likely will with the majority conservative Supreme Court) revoke same sex marriage federally, returning it to the states and we live in a state that already has state laws against gay marriage ( meaning the instant the Supreme Court makes their decision, same sex marriage would be banned in our state{I hope Im not mannsplanning, i know I kind of am but it’s how my brain works through things Im sorry}). My girlfriends friend had asked my girlfriend (jokingly but not so jokingly) if she would marry her, as a fuck you to the government being that they couldn’t undo the marriage and this friend could then say “I was able to get married”. Now WITHOUT going into any further thought about the semantics of what a marriage is or should be or why someone gets married(which i do in my own head but I digress), I love this and I support this(granted I didn’t think I’d be someone in this kind of scenario). They also had the conversation that this is a completely platonic thing, that they’re not even gonna do so much as kids at the reception (which I definitely wouldn’t have been ok with, but supposedly neither are they [I say supposedly but I belief my girlfriend so]).

The issue here is that when this whole thing was brought up i half jokingly said to my girlfriend- “so im your best man right?” And she instantly said “no- well… no, I don’t think so… idk”. Upon that reaction I was like “whaaaaaat, how yo man not gonna be yo best man” and she replied with “idk”. I then asked am I invited to which she said “idk”. I then asked- “ do you want me to be there”, being that I had assumed I would be at my girlfriend’s wedding and kinda offended at the prospect that I wouldn’t be. Now after asking every day if I’m even allowed to go and her response being “idk” everytime im getting upset and kind of offended by the prospect of not even being invited man, like I feel very disrespected. I just tried to have this conversation with her and her response was “it’s not that serious” and if I ask “do you want me to be there, can I go, is there a reason you don’t want me there?” Her response everytime is “idk”. For more context, they’re not really taking the wedding seriously like she’s saying, (they’re doing the reception in the coffee shop they work at after hours) but I’m still hurt by 1. Not even being invited or even thought of being invited, 2. The fact that when I was trying to have the conversation with her she pretty much said the same two things and refused to have at least a dialogue with me. Now for full context I did ask “would the other people not want me there” to which she said “you know the answer to that” which is because a good chunk of her friends don’t like me, and ive known this information for a while (ive only met the bride one time when I popped into the shop to give my girlfriend surprise icecream while she was on shift) .From what my girlfriend told me is that it’s mostly unsubstantiated. They associated me with one of the other coworkers exes being that me and him were friends and he was annoying, at their place of work all the time, being extra, all together doing to much, and they can’t really do much cuz, they’re at work. I got lumped in with him (I did not do those things ) because it was easy to, I associate with him, and Im a guy (her words but paraphrased I swear). I am not sure whether the other bride (they’re both brides) has formed any kind of opinion on me yet. 
Unimportant but I’m also salty that it’s happening on Halloween being that we were making plans to do stuff on Halloween but the bride wants to get married on Halloween so now her plans get priority, not really mad just a little salty.


TLDR:
My girlfriend is getting platonically married to her friend as a favor/supportful action to her friend as a fuck you to the govt for possibly revoking same sex marriage and Im not invited.

1okk492,https://i.redd.it/j63giwkr8dyf1.jpeg,The Age of the Emotional Roomba,"Sometimes it feels like we’ve stopped emotionally being people and started being more like appliances. Not the useful kind that make toast or brew coffee, but the little round kind that hums quietly through the living room, bumping into walls and sucking up whatever happens to be on the floor.

I think that we have essentially become emotional Roombas at this point, wandering aimlessly across the vast carpet of modern life, guided by invisible algorithms and the occasional viral post that tells us where to go next.

You can almost hear the whirring sound of our collective motor as we drift toward the latest outrage, or the next shiny distraction. A celebrity says something absurd, and suddenly we are all there, clustering like lint, cleaning up their mess while adding a bit of our own. Tomorrow it will be a new trend, a new digital broom to chase across the tiles of our attention span. We like to believe we are making choices, but really, we’re just bouncing from signal to signal, waiting for our battery to die or the Wi-Fi to go out.

It’s not entirely our fault. Thinking has become exhausting. Reflection doesn’t come with a “like” button, and you can’t monetize quiet contemplation. There is no dopamine rush in sitting alone with your own thoughts, unless those thoughts happen to go viral on TikTok.

So we outsource our opinions to the influencers and commentators who do the heavy lifting for us. They tell us what’s funny, what’s offensive, and what to be outraged about this week. They even give us the vocabulary to express our outrage, complete with emojis and hashtags.

And we are grateful for it. We no longer have to wonder what’s true, or what’s worth caring about. Someone will tell us soon enough. All we have to do is nod, repost, and move on. It’s efficient, in the same way that a self-driving car is efficient. You arrive somewhere, but you have no idea how you got there.

The real tragedy of it all is that the human mind is a remarkable thing; but only when used. It’s not a decorative organ, though that’s how we treat it these days, polishing it occasionally with a podcast or a quote from a dead philosopher before putting it back on the shelf. Like a muscle, it atrophies without exercise. The less we think, the less we can think. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy of dullness. We scroll ourselves, day by day, into a deeper stupor, lulled by a constant feed of amusement and outrage that never quite gives us enough time to realize we’re starving for real thought.

Sometimes I wonder what future archaeologists will make of us. They’ll dig up our glowing rectangles and marvel at how a civilization could be so informed and so ignorant at the same time. They’ll find our social media posts and assume they were written during some collective fever dream. “Surely,” they’ll say, “they didn’t all believe this nonsense — did they?”

But we did. Because it was easier. Because the hum of the Roomba is soothing. Because independent thought requires courage, and courage is a muscle we haven’t used in a long time either.

Maybe it’s not too late to reboot ourselves. Maybe we can still pull the plug on the endless hum and sit, for a while, in silence. It would be strange at first, uncomfortable even, to have to think our own thoughts and face our own reflections without a screen to filter them. But perhaps, somewhere in that quiet, we might rediscover what it feels like to be human again.

Until then, the Roomba spins on.

He’s a sweet person and always goes a little out of his way for me. We recently went to a farm festival with another girl to which I had gotten an item and when it became an issue to carry he, he carried it for me insisting that he was fine even after I offered to take it back. He ended up buying me coffee and food as well before the haunted house. I was nervous as it was my first haunted house and he offered his hand for me to hold. We held hands even though I wasn’t really scared anymore throughout it, even rejoining our hands when we were separated for a bit. Some parts he’d put his arm around my shoulders or move me either side of him so scare actors would come up to him. He was almost protective. Things were fine until I had a panic attack and he ended up first asking if they could stop the loud noise so I could walk through, then comforting me when I had my panic attack. This was almost two weeks ago. 

I set this up because he knows I have a massive crush on a guy who left my life. My friend works for a college pantry so I normally come to get my order when he works and just talk to him. A day ago I went to get my order and  I was talking to him about said crush and how i listen to crush’s Spotify and can’t help but think of said crush. My friend got really red in the face and started asking me if I got my order then rushed to get it together. He told me he refused to talk about it or the guy I mentioned and wouldn’t talk about why he was flustered even when his boss asked. A friend of mine pointed out I might have hurt his feelings and that he probably sees me as more. I always thought he was being friendly to me and into our mutual friend more. I apologized to him and he gave me a “reason” that seemed like a lie given he explicitly told me he didn’t want to talk about the situation when it happened. 

This was all after I complimented him and had a small conversation over him believing he was chubby and me saying he’s not. So he was super happy until I mentioned the other guy. I’ve talked about my crush to him before and never an issue. Also to add earlier in the day he gestured for a hug when he saw me as well, but he’s never really hugged me before and definitely not the mutual friend. I can’t help, but wonder if there’s more to this actually like my other friend said or if it’s really just him being friendly like I think it is. Did I hurt his feelings? He’s been ignoring me since text wise. ",1,1761880737.0,bodylanguage,3,1.0,False

Hi again. It’s been a while. A lot has happened hence why it took so long to organize my thoughts. As always, let’s start with questions from the community

* **Okay, are you planning on figuring out how that table was expanding?? That would be a priority for me.**  Nope, not ever. I ain’t messing with Old Folk stuff even with a 10 feet pole.
* **What if those people were seeping in from some other shell dimension? I would also be weary of that Mo Wellers guy. Seems spooky.** Interesting theory. Haven’t had any experiences with “Shell Dimensions” yet but i’ll keep an eye out. My personal theory is that it was just Old Folk starting a revel but I’d rather not find out. I don’t know about Mo Wellers. He seemed friendly and helpful enough, but I’ll make sure to let you guys know if I encounter him again.
* **Would you be willing to scan that QR code on the giant brick and tell us if it has anything cool?** Well, since you asked, I went back there, and uhh, look for yourself.

Grey sky. Grey smoke. Grey buildings. Grey streets. Grey people. You don’t often realize how dull everything is without the bright lens of an unquestioned sun. I like the nude ugliness of that reality, however. It feels more true, more real. 

I feel the same way about people. We all put on sunny pretend smiles and faces, I know this especially well, working in retail. But it’s always with those you can be “grey” with, with those friends with whom you can just be yourself and vibe, that you feel most at ease.

So, this grey morning, I let my grey self out during the walk to the shop. Putting on the chill dark fantasy lofi music playlist I have saved on my phone, I let the light rain run across my face and appreciate its slight bite. 

It’s one of these small moments where life feels like a dream. Where nothing matters and every little thing is beautiful. I take in a red leaf, blown to the ground by the Autumn wind. In its shrivelled form it has taken the slightly curved shape and water pooled in its center.

 I admire the beauty of that small miracle. Nature has made a cup! How dreadfully boring. How terrifyingly beautiful.

My dreamlike state abruptly ends. It comes in the form of the large glowing sign of the shop appearing in my field of view. Suddenly, everything is dull and grey again, and I just feel exhausted and sad, despite the day just starting out.

The store’s opening goes as usual. I bang on the old heavy wooden doors until Claudius comes to open the rusty iron grate. I’ve never mentioned Claudius before, I think.

He’s a sweetheart, an old Hob with a smile so wide always plastered on his face you’d think he’s some kind of mascot. Used to serve in the legion too, so he’s full of interesting stories and tidbits from the times before. Like that time he flirted with a barkeeper who later went on to become Minister of Arcane Arts. Typical Claudius. 

That is his main weakness, though, his love of chatting can make him slightly less efficient than others at times. Which is why the Owner wants to have him working as little as possible. But we couldn’t do without Claudius. He’s always here earlier than seems reasonable, cleaning and getting a warm serving of coffee ready for everyone. And he’s the only one to offer lessons.

Ramblings aside, I sit quietly at the main desk after punching in, scrolling on my phone while waiting for Al to arrive. I’m caught off guard by the sudden grinding of the Basement’s boiler. 

Its sickening crunching and crushing and squishing and sucking fills my head with unpleasant images I don’t want to think about, and the sharp smell of iron fills the air.

“Judges be damned, not again!” Claudius exclaims

“I’ll go get it, stay here to greet Alister when he arrives” I reply, deadpan.

I begin the walk, defeated, to the Basement. I go fast, however, as I’d like the horrid sounds to stop as soon as I can help it. I quickly pass by the large racks, looming tall above me, dozens of bikes glinting in the morning lowlight. I sneak by the mechanic’s workshop, the forge’s flame blinking slowly, almost like a cyclop’s eye, deep in the darkness. I don’t linger as I hear the faint clanging of tools. 

Reaching the edge of the large industrial lift, I do take a small moment to stare at the yawning abyss below, reminding me that the Basement feels almost like a different world, and I question the choices that have brought me here. But alas, a choice I no longer have anymore. And so I step, one careful foot after the other, onto the lift. And I blink.

The damp, greenish glow of the Basement’s air greets me back. The low beams, so low I have to almost crouch when walking through, angle the light in a way that feels almost religious. The rows and rows of bikes on either side of me complete the picture, reminding me of a crowd of supplicants at the entrance of a cathedral.

And an entrance it is. The almost beatific reality of the Basement’s first section, with its many stored bikes, too many to count, makes way for the darker parts. Many brass pipes appear in and out of the floor and walls, in seemingly no sensible organization. Steam blows, giving an almost mystical feel to the place, I would almost be awed by it all, if it wasn’t for that Judges-forsakened sound.

I make my way through the nonsensical halls and hallways of the basement. Some look a lot older than the others, having stone brick floors and wall engravings, where others have paneled wood and crates of material.

The structure of the place always shifts, making it hard to navigate. But when you do it enough you start to pick up on small stuff that lets you stay on track. Like how no matter how far you go the \*real\* exit will always be visible, though sometimes not much. Today something else helps me stay oriented, the sound.

Following the direction it’s emanating ominously from, I keep my brisk pace through the labyrinthine sub-sections. I keep nervously patting my pocket, making sure I haven’t dropped the neatly folded sheet I triple checked was ready before heading down. No turning back now.

After only a couple more paces, I arrive at my dreaded destination. The boiler.

The impossibly large cylinder looms tall above me, it feels too big, almost like its very presence is overwhelming the space it occupies. The old red paint covering the brutal machinery looks somewhat rotten, flaking off in spaces and forming bulbous tumours in others. Its colours are violent, despite being a pretty dark muted crimson, it radiates through the whole room, making everything else a dull grey.

I stare for what feels like an eternity at the crank, that sits still, inviting me forward. Eventually, I snap out of it and grab it. Straining with effort against the rusted mechanism, I pull once, twice, thrice. However many needed to open the door and end the nightmare.

The sounds grow louder with each crank, what was before simply grinding and popping, is now accompanied by a groan that quickly turns into a deafening wail. But I keep cranking and cranking.

Finally, the door opens with little ceremony, and too fast for a door that big. A shifting mound of flesh falls flat on the dusty floors with a wet slapping sound. The grinding, thankfully, has stopped. The wailing, however, has not.

Before I can even recover, the mass has. It turns 180-degrees in a speed that feels impossible for its grotesque, shapeless form. Dozens, if not hundreds of faces are suddenly looking at me, and they’re all contorted, some in extreme pain, others in anger.

It raises a wave of arms at me, all misshapen, all broken. In the ripple of movement from the limbs, the bloody film covering the flesh of the mass sprays its gore in a wide arc, spreading a slightly pink coloured and foul smelling juice all around the floors.

I, luckily, was prepared. Reaching into my pocket, as I have practiced time and time again, I take out the folded sheet, and in one swift motion of the wrist, unfold it to its full size, slightly bigger than an US letter format paper sheet. 

I don’t need to look at my right hand to know exactly what the various symbols ornamenting the scroll are, I’ve inked them myself. The upside of following Minor Wardings class, and having a hobby for studying ancient magical practices, is that I can spend long excruciating hours to make a decent magical circle. The downside is that all the tasks at the job that would require hexworks are handed to me, and you better believe I’m not paid more for it.

Now, of course they could send highborns whose innate knacks are a whole lot useful and less of a pain in the ass to use, like Al and his calling of the Name of earth, or Cedrik, but “managers are too valuable for that”. So, fuck me I suppose.

I tap the paper, a light finger brush against the bright yellow material. Immediately, a series of events happen. Which I can explain since I’ve designed the spell myself. A Douan rune in an animation circle with an esoterica intent, for touch trigger, flares to life. It then activates an instant link type, turning on an Aer rune in an enchantment ring with a protection intent, which then loops into the final part, a Tan rune in a force circle with harm intent, repeated four times with adjective links. 

The result is pretty bombastic; the conflagration of everything in a 10 square meter area around me, while I myself am protected by a barrier of wind. 

That might seem awesome, until I remember it took me multiple weeks to make that spell. Inking is a very difficult and risky process, which is why it fell hard out of popularity in recent times, and me following it is seen as a risque fancy hobby at best.

There is little left of the mound, only a couple ashes. Since the floors are already mighty dusty, that means no cleanup necessary. I crumple the now useless sheet back into my pocket, and close the door of the Boiler once more. 

I whistle as I make my way back through the now peaceful Basement. I’ve bought us a nice quiet. But the sound comes back, always. And so I’ll have to go back down into the basement again.

I try not to dwell on the existential dread of nine to five jobs being an endless loop of repetitions as I climb onto the dull blue metal of the lift, focusing instead on the video game I’ve been playing during my nights, and it’s getting a new expansion soon! I blink

The front of the shop is a nice return to reality. When I arrive there, having picked up my sky blue coloured work shirt from my locker on the way, Al is already there, chatting with Claudius, a small look of annoyance on his face.

I greet them both, a genuine smile painting my face.

“Problem taken care of!” I announce.

“We could tell, with the quiet and all” Al replies.

“So, what’s the problem? Big tour group headed our way?” I ask

“I’ll go guard the bikes outside” Claudius interjects, clearly done with being inside.

“Nah, big name coming in this morning. I’ll give you a sign when he arrives. I need you to give him primo service, Andrei’ll be watching the cameras for sure” Al finally replies to my question.

I shudder, not even at the prospect of us being watched, but rather at Al’s careless mention of the Owner’s name.

Despite the rather dreadful opening of the store. The morning goes actually quite well. 

There's heavy rain outside, and even an occasional lightning strike. Meaning we don’t get any walk ins. Meaning Al and I get to just sit at the counter and have chill chats for a while.

There’s no way to perfectly describe Al, the force of nature that he is, but now’s as good a time as any to try. 

Al (that’s short for Alister, in case you didn’t catch on) is one of my few best friends. He’s the kind of guy that anyone immediately gets comfortable with. I suppose it’s from the air of confidence that comes with the kind of family he’s from. He really is a nice guy, though. He may joke and quip and jab, but at the end of the day, I can confidently say that if you’re in his team, he will always have your back, no matter what. I try to be the same.

Physically, he’s your average main character of dark fantasy novels. Dark hair, fine features, average height, strong build. An instantly recognizable type of reliable man.

I’ve known him since middle school, and we’ve relied on each other many times, so working together at the same shop is a natural evolution, despite taking wildly different study paths.

So, you can imagine these slow mornings where we get to sit and chat about the video games we’re playing and the latest internet drama. 

This morning, I made the unfortunate mistake of offhandedly mentioning I got to watch one of my favourite 2010s action movies with my crush, which caused him to incessantly grill me with questions about her for the rest of the morning.

Our peace eventually gets disturbed, though, as tends to happen. It comes in the form of an abnormally tall man wearing a three piece suit entering the shop. His clothes are inexplicably completely dry and clean. Despite being handsome, something about his features remind me of an ox, or maybe a bison. He is also incredibly wide, muscles rippling under his linen shirt. As he makes his way near us, I take notice that a comically small top hat rests on his head, with 2 small bumps under his unruly hair holding it in place. 

Right before he reaches my counter, Al gives me the sign. So, this is the guy, honestly I would’ve been surprised if this *wasn*’t the guy. We rarely get 7 feet tall football players here after all.

“Top of the morning, lad” he greets me, in a thick British accent.

“Hi, I assume you’ve already reserved, sir….?” I trail off, giving him a chance to give me his name.

“Teners, Ben Teners. And that’s quite right, laddy, got me one of those carbon bikes booked. If you could go and grab it for me it would be quite lovely” He says, looking as though he’s done with speaking.

Normally, there’s many more steps to this, like signing a sealing contract and such. But seeing as I was warned about this guy and service. I hurry to comply without much second thought.

After getting the bike up and ready, adjusting the handlebars and seat to his monstrous size, and making sure the repair kit is full, I hand it to him. I can’t say what I was expecting, to be honest, but it certainly wasn’t for the man to hop right on it like a gleeful child, still wearing his dapper clothing, and start biking away. It’s hard to tell with how thick the rain is, but it looks like he’s still dry despite being under it.

As his silhouette grows farther and farther, I make a quick joke with Al about how that guy is for sure some kind of freak with an underground sex dungeon, but the mood isn’t really there anymore. We return to our individual posts and continue on with this gray day. Before closing the heavy doors, however, I do notice a strange faint smell in the rain, but I cannot quite pinpoint what it is.

The rest of the day after that is quite boring, as it was before hotshot Teners arrived. Since there’s not much to do, with the rain and all, Al decides to send me on a grocery run. Right, well at least I won’t have to go to the meat market. There’s a small, moving grocery shop pretty much one street away from us. It’s a minor hassle to find it whenever you need to go there, since the entire building is in different places every time, sometimes moving through different streets. But it’s a rather chill task.

I gear up before heading out. Since the rain is pouring down so hard, I put on one of our white plastic ponchos over my jacket, and take an umbrella. I make sure to not forget my wallet, something I’ve sorely regretted not doing in a previous trip, and pass the threshold of the doors. 

Immediately, I am hit on two senses at once. First, the rain falls hard on me, despite my multiple layers of clothing and protection, stunning me for only a fraction of a second. Second, there’s that smell again. I think it might be vanilla, but I’m not quite sure. What I can definitely say is that it has that sickly sweet feel to it that make you feel like you don’t want to smell too much of it despite it being nice.

I have to admit, rain this time of year does make the City beautiful. The large puddles reflecting the many lights of buildings gives a life to the landscape the gray sky could never. The Autumn leaves, pooling with water, give a stark contrast to the concrete, with their oranges and reds and yellows.

I pass through many wondrous sights on my way to the store. A street ramen, a bay window coffee shop, a library restaurant, a collector of ancient artifacts. I even catch a glimpse of a piece of ruin. That puts a smile on my face.

I don’t see ruin fragments often, and even when I do I can never find that particular one again, but they’re always interesting. I can’t get close to it or even take a picture, however. Showing special interest to them always seems to make the police show up, and even talking about them can get you in weird trouble. This is one of the reasons I hope no one I know sees this blog. The other is my friends, and especially Al, would never let me live it down.

I finally find the shop. Huh, there’s a new cashier today. Usually it’s a young Chinese guy or a really old Korean man. Today, it appears it’s a pretty, young woman. Her work shirt is neat and wrinkle-less, but there’s multiple suspicious stains on it. After picking up the necessities (mainly consisting of water, milk, and monster energy drinks) I walk up to her register. 

Her name tag reads “Jade G.”

“So, the usual?” she asks, deadpan.

“I suppose so.” I reply, unsure how she knew what my usual is.

After paying, I start to gather my stuff. As I do, I notice a sort of look on her face. I can’t really describe it. It’s sort of a mix of annoyance and worry. 

“Wait,” she says, not meeting my eyes “If you need information on the local gentry, come back here”

Leaving me no time to reply, she storms off, slamming an Employees Only door behind her.

I had a feeling she looked too alive to be a random grocery shop cashier. I, however, have spent my whole life not dealing with the gentry any more than absolutely necessary, and even that is too much in my opinion. I’m not about to change that now.

Fair and old folk aside, I head back into the rain, letting it literally and figuratively shower me away.

When I pass the door threshold again, I notice Al has a grim look on his face. Well, that’s no good.

“What’s up?” I ask.

“The guy, Ben Teners, I need you to go check up on him.”

“That’s fine man, where’s he at?”

“The meat market”

As I hear those words come out of Alister’s lips, time slows for a moment. A thousand thoughts and images go through my mind, faster than I can process. I consider asking him to go instead of me. But of course he can’t. The store cannot be without a manager, even if he is only an assistant. After a moment of internal wailing, I steel myself, and give Al a simple not in response. I will go, and do my duty, and no more.

The ride is easy. It always is. The wind and raindrops slapping on my face and helmet being the only thing slowing me, and yet it feels like they are screaming at me to stop, to turn back. As the tall trees stretch unnaturally around me due to the speed I’m going on my back, I keep telling myself that it will be over quick. I know which alley he’s supposed to be in. All I need to do is to find him, make an assessment, then leave.

When I reach the entrance of the market, I use every last bit of my resolve to not look, to ignore whatever is going on. I can do nothing to stop the smell, though. The fumes of rotten fish and cooking meats overpower the sweet smell the rain has had all day. Thank the Judges, I find the alley only after a couple seconds.

I can immediately tell that I’m too late. Even from a distance away, I notice what I can identify as Mr Teners’ body lying on the ground, a large shrouded figure looming above him. A Cannard Noz, I think to myself. 

“Hey there” I make sure to announce myself, lest the being strike out in startlement.

“*Your kind is not welcome here, runt of the Lion’s court*” a low, chilling voice replies.

“Trust me, madam, I’m well aware. Your victim, however, is under our protection. Let me see him” I try to sound commanding, but my voice is slightly shaking.

“*Oh you can see him alright, but my work here is already done. Farewell, Valiant's bastard*”

With little ceremony, she vanishes in a swirl of white cloth and blood. After waiting a bit to make sure the coast is clear, I make my way to Teners’ body. Sure enough, he has been drowned and his heart ripped out. Oh well, I’ve done what I came here to do. After quickly snapping a picture with my phone, I eagerly walk out of the market, wanting my senses to absorb as little of it as physically possible. 

The ride back is wholly different from the ride to the market. The wind and rain have picked up a lot more, and there’s frequent lightning strikes splitting the sky in the distance. The thunder’s deep, bass rumbles shakes my bones and impacts my soul. The smell has gotten stronger too. I can without a doubt say it is vanilla now, though it has a weird undertone. Almost feeling like someone sprayed a corpse with a literal ton of vanilla extract.

As I leave the untamed wilderness in which the meat market is hidden, and get closer to civilization, I start to notice a strange pattern. People appear to randomly break out into dance as they walk under the rain. Eventually, I see that they’re dancing in perfect sync too.

The nearer I get to the harbour, and subsequently the shop, the louder and more frequent the thunder gets. It’s starting to become mighty annoying. I can even notice the black storm spires shaking from the repeated impacts in the distance.

When I finally close the doors behind me, a true pandaemonium has broken out in the streets outside. People have started dancing in a maddening rhythm, and have even begun tearing off their clothes. I notice none of them appear to be locals. Not entirely surprising, these kinds of things typically only affect tourists.

The day after that is rather uneventful. We only get one other walk in, a man who only identified himself as “Mister Cole”. He asked about Ben Tener’s whereabouts. Unsure of how I should answer him I simply said he was last seen in the meat market. 

The guy seemed weird, so I hope the market takes him.

Eventually, my shift ends, as it always does. I clock out, take off my work shirt, and bid farewell to Al and Claudius. 

While walking to the train stations, I notice a couple weird things. Well, weirder than usual. First, the people have gone, like, all of them. Second, there’s a large military helicopter on top of one of the skyscrapers. I don’t know what the government is doing, but it can’t be good if it involves sending stormfall troops cityside.

[Ominous ahh evil building](https://preview.redd.it/9hoxfwe46dyf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8f34382b54844fc778f4f23fafabc383ceb5a35)

The last thing seems rather innocent at first. A small, hunched over lady is cowering from the rain under a construction site. Deciding to give her one of the couple couronnes I have bouncing in my pocket, I edge closer to her. That’s when I take note of the purple rug in front of her. I thought it was a blanket, but upon closer inspection it is an old looking rug, with golden embroideries on it. A half dozen cards are spread upon it, with beautiful etchings on them.

Well, fuck. I just walked right up to a Szeptucha. She lifts her gnarled looking head at me slowly. Her eyelids flutter open, and the many eyeballs hidden underneath rotate wildly, colliding with each other.

“Ahhhhh boy, finally someone with enough sense to notice me” she croons.

“Apologies, mother, here, have a coin for your troubles” I say, trying to get out of here as soon as possible.

“Nonsense, my boy,” she says, patting my cheek with her fatless claws. “You can’t well pay me before I offer you anything first. But for your generosity I’ll be twice as kind. How’s about a boon and a piece of advice ?”

“If that’s what your heart feels is right, mother” I reply, not wanting to offend her.

“Alright then, take this leather pouch. It holds a secret you will need one day. As for the advice, well.” She looks at each of the cards for a while “Kurwa, boy, it looks like you’ll have to end the world” She looks a little bewildered. An expression who absolutely does not fit her wrinkled bag of a face. 

She promptly snatches the coin from my hand, then goes back to sleep before I can think of thanking her.

The train ride home is one of wonder and confusion. So much has happened today. Yet, I cannot piece together the meaning of it all, how it connects together. I suppose that is part of the madness that comes with living in this city.

1okjtqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1okjtqg/how_to_get_your_ex_back_the_brain_science_of_no/,How to Get Your Ex Back: The Brain Science of No Contact That Flips Dopamine Cravings into Real Pull,"54M here – the guy who chased his ex into silence after 8 years, convinced one more text would ""fix"" the ""space"" gut-punch. Spoiler: It amped my brain's addiction loop, turning hope into hell. But diving into the biology? Game-changer. No contact isn't magic—it's neuroscience: Breakups hijack your dopamine (reward chemical), mimicking drug withdrawal (Journal of Neurophysiology). That ""one more try"" craving? Your brain begging for the hit. I rode it out 90 days; she reached at month 6, post-rebound. We talked, but I walked stronger. Here's the bio-backed blueprint to get your ex back—not as a desperate grab, but a permanent upgrade.

**Step 1: Hack Dopamine Withdrawal – No Contact as Your Detox**  
Your ex's absence triggers ""prediction error"" in the brain—scarcity principle (Psychology Today) boosts her perceived value 40%. Full blackout (delete, block, no peeks) starves the craving. I slipped with a ""hope you're good""—cue cortisol spike (stress hormone). Commit 30-90 days; use a ""craving timer"" app for urges. Result? Brain rewires—65% of forum stories report reach-outs in 6 months when consistent.

**Step 2: Flood Endorphins – Turn Pain into Power**  
Anxiety post-breakup? Endorphins (feel-good rush) cut rumination 28% (APA data). Swap scrolls for 20-min walks or gym—releases BDNF (brain fertilizer) for clarity. I logged wins (""solo hike crushed""); it shifted ""miss her"" to ""miss this high."" Glow-up subtly (hobby posts, not thirst)—signals unmissable confidence. Biology says: Upgraded you pulls harder than pleas.

**Step 3: Vet the Reach-Out – Biology Meets Boundaries**  
She pinged: ""Grown—miss us."" Brain lit up (dopamine tease), but I vetted: Green? Her accountability (therapy for avoidance). Red? Convenience crumbs. Test: ""Coffee, show me change."" True ""get ex back"" needs mutual neuro-sync—equality, not chase.

Myth: No contact ""forces"" return. Truth: It forces *your* reset—back or not. I'm proof: Happily married, no ghosts. If it's her, biology favors the strong.

What's one bio-hack you're trying to break the craving? Share – your tweak could save someone.

**TL;DR:** Get ex back bio-way: No contact detoxes dopamine (30-90 days), endorphins glow-up anxiety (walks/gym), vet reach-outs with boundaries. You first—permanent pull.

One crave at a time – this sub's lifeline.

I’m writing to you again-softly, like a prayer folded into the night.

I want Mom and me to work not for someone else’s dream, but for our own. I want mornings that smell like coffee and possibility, whether we’re tucked in the corner of a sunlit café or at a desk by our own window, music humming low, the world gentle around us.

I want the Final Fantasy Tactics remake for my Switch-not just for the game itself, but for the memory it carries. For the nights my sister and I fell in love with its story, for the way it reminded us that strategy and heart can coexist, that even battlefields can hold beauty.

More than anything, I want to breathe again. To find what home truly feels like-not a place, but a heartbeat, a rhythm that matches my own.

I want to live. Not survive, not wait-live.

We did our first transfer 10/16, a day before my 36th birthday and we're doing IVF for unexplained MFI. We had been trying naturally for a few years only to find out we probably won't be able to conceive without IVF due to low counts, morphology issues, and high DNA frag. My husband and I are pretty healthy individuals, never smokers and have a drink maybe 3 times a year, overall healthy eating. We did two egg retrievals - 1st one: 18 eggs, 14 mature, all 14 fertilized, 9 blasts, and 2 euploids (same gender and we don't know the gender). Without hesitation, I opted in for a second egg retrieval due to our family plans and for having a few in the bank in case things don't work out. My MD did not include zymot the first round because he stated he doesn't like to throw everything in all at once. He also opted in for a ""gentle stim"" for the second ER. This is why I am so sad and angry. I had 24 follicles but the MD didn't want to overcrowd the ovaries and focused on quality vs quantity. We ended up with 6 eggs resulting in 1 euploid (I think 4AB). We sat down and asked why we didn't just repeat the first protocol to have numbers on our side. Our MD actually apologized, stated ""you're right, we should have gone for the numbers"", and that he regrets not reviewing our first cycle and thinking about it some more. We then restested a chaotic from the first ER which actually came back as a euploid. 

All of my euploids are the same gender. I don't want to know what they are but it truly breaks my heart to know that I may not have a daughter or a son. Most of my anger and sadness stems from not retrieving all of my eggs during the second ER and I will always wonder what if? I have the eggs now but I may not have them in the near future, so why wouldn't we just get them while we can? Our MD wanted to do a transfer after all this but I pushed for an EMB even though I don't have any endo symptoms. My receptiva came back positive at 1.8 and he wanted to transfer irregardless but we advocated for 2 months lupron supression (I even called the receptiva folks for some insight). And now here I am. All that we've been through and it still didn't stick. Part of me wonders what it would be like if we didn't switch doctors but who knows. I'm just going through it, questioning everything along the way. I did have a drink, some coffee, and I plan on having an italian sub this week to cheer myself up. I'm just overwhelmingly sad and I'm trying my best to stay positive. ",4,1761879719.0,IVF,4,1.0,False

1okjoe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lipedema/comments/1okjoe0/whats_been_working_stage_15_probably/,"What's been working (stage 1.5, probably)","Hello! I (40F) I came to this board at the beginning of this year because my legs were extremely heavy and swollen, bruised and agonizingly painful, and doctors did not understand what I was telling them. Through googling things like ""leg fat hurts"" I found out about this disorder and made my way to this board. 

Been trying different things and grappling with it over the course of this year. I was so completely hopeless, lost, and honestly terrified when I first came to this board. Thank you all for your contributions. I am so glad we can help each other where doctors fail. This board seriously saved my life, I was completely out of my mind with pain.

So, this post turned out to be really long, but I wanted to report on some things I've tried and how it all went for me:

Keto diet (classic keto, 80% fat) - This is the first piece of advice I got here and I started immediately. It was like a miracle. Keto me from retaining water and took my lipedema pain down to basically zero within the first week (likely the ""whoosh"" of losing all your water weight). Also reduced my allergies and inflammation all over.  I am eating whole foods (including cheeses), except for Rebel ice cream... Yummm

Alcohol - when I started keto at the beginning of this year, I was sober, but then I started having wine again, and then I started having wine everyday, and it was really impacting my life. Stopped drinking October 1 and i am looking and feeling MUCH better. Maybe a 'duh' discovery but I had to report it!

Self lymph massage - as learned from the Cancer Rehab PT YouTube. Very beneficial and painless. Subtle, gentle, but really helps the fluid move up to pee out. I am not currently doing this regularly, as my legs feel fine right now, but do it as needed.

Butchers Broom - Excellent for me. Indispensable. Takes the extra fluid out of my legs. I'm not taking it everyday anymore, more like once or twice a week if my legs are doing poorly (if I eat too much salt or something).

DIM + CDG - I think this has been a definite game changer for me in a number of ways. Peri symptoms were really bad. Suddenly I was having hot flashes and crying all the time. I tried HRT and did not like how it made me feel. After watching this video where she describes her self-experimentation and losing 30 lb (https://youtu.be/Ni5kcSq0Jw4) it really seemed to me like I had too much estrogen or a problem processing estrogen, so I started taking this once a day. I haven't had any of the perimenopause symptoms again, and my legs are looking REALLY good. I also had a blood draw that showed extremely high estrogen but normal levels of the other hormones, and while I know hormones are constantly fluctuating, this test was really really high, and the symptoms matched my experience. I did have some intense hair shedding at first but that has totally stopped. Makes urine look a
orangish at first.

Compression socks - Love the knee-high wool blend Sockwell socks, they give me energy! Didn't really feel the benefit from the thigh-high thick nylons I got from Amazon. Also got a rash from the silicone dots at the top. Currently not using any compression because the swelling is under control from diet/supplements/weather

Salt intake - I was told by doctors for years I need to add salt to my food to help with my POTS and low blood pressure, especially since I'm on keto now. I found that once I *stopped* doing that, my fluid balance in my body became much more manageable. So, no extra salt or electrolytes for me, thanks!

Hydration - I have stopped trying to drink 2L of pure water a day, and I'm just drinking when I'm thirsty. I'm still getting about 2L of water through veggies, coffee, tea, and drinking water. Drinking so much water was messing up my electrolytes and (I think) causing me to swell.

Vibration plate - it's great! One of the first things I tried. I take a wide stance, to get a strong shake. Really shook up my lymphatic system and activated all my little muscles. Makes me itch, but that's normal. Haven't been using it much lately because...

Exercise - Since things have been going so well I thought I would look into learning to run instead of just walk around all day. I watched some YouTubes about running warm-up drills where you run in place, lifting your knees up in front of you and making sure to get a lot of ankle movement. I have found that doing this for even 60 seconds a day, at a very fast pace, pumps the swelling out of my lower legs in a way that walking never has. It's the same effect for me as the vibration plate, except a bit stronger, probably because of the ankle pumping really flexing the calf muscles instead of just vibrating everything. This is the most recent approach I've added and I love how it's just 60 seconds out of my day. The smallest HIIT workout ever?

Sauna - No effect really, but nice to be warm. Sometimes it feels quite gross because the relaxation makes my skin/lipedema go all flabby. Not painful, though.

Weightlifting - Awesome! I do a basic dumbbell workout at home 2-3x a week I got from YouTube. I have more muscle than ever in my life but I don't look buff or anything. Easier to do life tasks. Was inspired by A Physical Education by Casey Johnston, as well as this board and wondering what I can do to take control over my body's growth.

Cooler weather - yes please! I think we all agree there :)

...That's all I can remember right now! I know it's not as exciting without photographs, but if you've been considering any of these approaches I hope that reading my experience helps you. The change in my leg texture is similar to the posts we see recently with GLP1 success: legs look smooth instead of bumpy. My pain is virtually gone. I still have bruises all over the legs and tricep area. My weight is the same, but I believe my body fat percentage is going down, and my legs are definitely slimmer.",2,1761879681.0,lipedema,0,1.0,False

1okjl3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1okjl3a/am_i_overreacting_for_feeling_resentful/,Am I overreacting for feeling resentful?,"I’m m32 and dated a girl for almost a year who is f32.

She did genuinely care for me a lot and loved me whole heartedly, which I did as well.

Some warning signs from the beginning. She dated very successful rich guys, think hedge fund managers and even wealthier. I told her I do okay for myself but not to that extent. She said she doesn’t care she just wants someone that cares about her

We both make around 300-500k each range as a ballpark. She lived her whole life in another country where the cultural norm is that the guy pays for everything. Also given she dated rich guys I’m sure they paid for everything.

She has expensive taste in food, clothing; and in the us things are usually split a bit more. I said I’m glad to cover more than half at the very least, 

Every meal is at least 100 or more, and it’s more like I have to cover everything whether it’s expensive or a cup of coffee. It’s really not about the money at all but just very basic respect. It’s not uncommon for me to spend 300 or more before she gets one thing that is like a lunch or a dinner. Again, she does well for herself and also makes a lot in income. 

She also loves to travel where I don’t need to travel as much. We travel 3 times this year, because she asked for it and not me. I’m expected to and end up paying for all of the hotels, pretty much all of the meals, maybe 80-90% of the trip.

We go on a long weekend trip which I put a lot of effort into, she booked the hotel. After the trip she asks me to send her money for the hotel. I ended up paying for the whole trip cause I didn’t care at that point. She also wanted to go to an expensive sports event which I ended up paying for and doing for her, just to make her happy. She then said she felt rejected because we didn’t go to her favorite clothing store there because I said it was late and we did a lot that long weekend. I said how do you not see everything I did for us, taking us on a trip at your request, doing everything you want but you’re going to make a big deal over not going to one store. 

The big thing is that I feel that she always looks at what she does not have or get and doesn’t appreciate the things I do for her.

She tells me she always has so many people chasing her, which was not genuine and made me feel like she wanted to tell me how desirable she is which upset me a lot.

She also said she is very aggressive, and said it’s very normal for her to curse at her partners when they fight. I never curse at anyone I’ve dated because that’s not me and I wouldn’t do that to someone I respect and love. She would scream and curse at me extremely loudly. I am rarely ever like that but when I get attacked like that I also react similarly. 

We have a lot of care for each other but I’m wondering if I have the right to feel resentful

I realize I am only saying the bad parts, but there was a lot if not more great things about us

I will admit I had my fair share of mistakes. I’m not trying to just bash on her and will admit I wasn’t perfect either. She says I wasn’t there for her when she needed me, which is true in a few cases. But I sincerely apologized and I think I was there for her and showed so much care way more often than 
not.

This is the biggest part. Everything I said to defend myself she said I was counting. Mentioning the things I do for us? Counting. Mentioning the trips I took us on? Counting? Paying for almost everything for those trips? Counting? Driving us everywhere? Counting. Paying for almost all of the dates? Counting. She said she doesn’t respect a man that counts. Anything I say to defend myself she saw it as counting. 

All of this was a huge turnoff and I felt this was very entitled behavior. It made me not respect or like her anymore, which really killed our romantic relationship in more ways than one. 

In her defense, she has a side that is sweet and wholesome and genuine. But the other parts exist at the same time. Despite all of this I still care about her as a person. 

Am I overreacting by being resentful of all the things that happened?

1okjjny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1okjjny/my_brother_is_marrying_someone_my_family_doesnt/,my brother is marrying someone my family doesn’t approve of,"hi guys. i’m sort of in a pickle. my brother is going to marry his high school sweetheart & there are a ton of red flags we’ve all witnessed but cannot express to my brother because he is so blinded by it all. let me explain. 

my brother & his fiancée lived with my parents for about 5 years & in that time they witnessed the weird dynamic they have as a couple. they have always felt that she takes more than she gives. my brother is at her beck & call, always, & it doesn’t seem to be reciprocated whatsoever. he always plans extravagant getaways for her birthday, valentines, everything she wants he buys & she has NEVER planned a dang thing for him on his birthday. he wears himself thin working his full time job & doordash just to be able to buy her the things she wants. he comes home after a long day of working and proceeds to do laundry and cook for her when she’s been cooped up in their room all day (she never came out of the room unless he was home which is strange because my parents are the nicest people in the world). mind you we’ve never once seen her do anything for herself let alone him aside from getting her nails and lashes done. i’m not saying the woman is the one who should be doing all the cooking & cleaning but it just seems she doesn’t care for my brother in the same way he does her considering he’s exhausted from working two jobs for over 14 hours a day. i’m also 99% sure he’s maxed out all of his credit cards buying her things because she’s a very materialistic person (hence why he started working doordash to pay off his debt but is now caught playing a never-ending game of catchup). but this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg.

everyone in my family has noticed while having dinner or having family time, (which they rarely partake in because they’re always busy with her family) when she gets up and goes to the restroom, my brother will text her what we’re talking about or what’s going on while she’s away.. which, in my opinion, seems like a little much. i’ve tried inviting him to coffee & such just to see how he’s doing & he ALWAYS has to bring her around. when i ask for it to be a brother/sister date he stops replying. it’s almost like he can’t hangout with his own family if she’s not present which is so freaking weird to me. i’ve also seen him secretly call her while he’s having 1 on 1 conversations with us as a family with her on the like listening to what we’re saying. i mean there’s just been a lot that has happened in the 10 years they’ve been together that it’d be too exhausting to think about and type out. we’ve tried calmly talking to him about it in the past & he goes bat shit crazy for even speaking her name wrongfully. it seems like a one-sided relationship & it breaks my heart because my brother is so sweet & deserves the world at his feet but he seems to be completely blinded by it all. am i crazy? is he dating a manipulative narcissist?

# Boots Season 2: The Desert of Secrets

**Introduction – From Boot Camp to Battlefield:** Season 1 of *Boots* ended on a dramatic cliffhanger: as the newly minted Marines celebrated their graduation, a news broadcast announced Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the impending deployment of U.S. troops[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=President%20Bush%20then%20announces%20the,be%20involved%20in%20the%20war). In that finale, 17-year-old Cameron Cope had just convinced his mother, Barbara, to let him stay in the Corps despite being underage[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=Crucible). Sergeant Sullivan – Cameron’s tough drill instructor with whom he shared an unspoken bond – went AWOL to save a missing recruit during the final exercise and then disappeared into the night after telling Cameron, “You’re ready… You’re a Marine now”[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=When%20Jones%20goes%20missing%2C%20Fajardo,goes%20AWOL%20to%20locate%20Jones). Sullivan’s fate was left uncertain; he’d been struggling with personal demons (including a near-fatal bar fight) and under investigation because of his sexuality, putting his future in jeopardy[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=Earlier%20in%20the%20season%2C%20Sullivan,decides%20to%20disregard%20his%20duties). Season 2 picks up at this pivotal moment, launching the characters from the training grounds into the reality of war. Set in late 1990 and early 1991 – a time when being gay in the military was still strictly forbidden[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=,to%20go%20to%20this%20conflict) – the season will blend high-stakes combat drama with deep emotional currents. The storyline delves into love and loyalty under fire, as Cameron and his comrades head to the Gulf War, their relationships tested by distance and danger. Below is a comprehensive episode-by-episode storyline for Season 2, packed with intense battles, heartfelt moments, and the enduring hope of love amid chaos.

# Episode 1 – “Call to Arms”

**Synopsis:** The season opener begins mere hours after the Season 1 finale. Cameron and his fellow graduates are still in their dress uniforms at the Marine Corps base bar when President George H. W. Bush’s address on TV sinks in: U.S. forces will deploy in response to Saddam Hussein’s aggression[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=President%20Bush%20then%20announces%20the,be%20involved%20in%20the%20war). The jubilant mood evaporates as reality sets in – boot camp is over, and a real war lies ahead.

* **Deployment Orders:** At dawn, Cameron’s unit receives official orders to join Operation Desert Shield. The young Marines scramble to prepare, adrenaline and anxiety high. Cameron, Ray McAffey (his best friend), and the rest of their platoon are told they’ll ship out to Kuwait within days to help defend against further Iraqi advance into the Arabian Peninsula[history.com](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-7/bush-orders-operation-desert-shield#:~:text=On%20August%207%2C%201990%2C%20President,resources%20in%20the%20%2065). There’s an urgent, almost chaotic energy as they pack gear and say hurried goodbyes. Cameron’s heart pounds with a mix of excitement and dread – this is what he signed up for, but he never imagined it would happen so soon.
* **Barbara’s Return:** Barbara Cope, having stayed overnight near the base after graduation, rushes to see her son one last time before deployment. In an emotional reunion, she fusses over Cameron’s packing, trying to slip extra socks and his favorite cookies into his duffel. She can’t hide her worry. “You’re so young,” she whispers, tears in her eyes, remembering that he’s only 17. Cameron reassures her with a bravado he doesn’t truly feel, saying he’s trained for this and will make her proud. Their bond, tested in Season 1 by his enlistment, now deepens. Barbara promises to write every day and presses a St. Christopher medal into his hand for protection. The scene is heartfelt, showing the **mother-son dynamic** that will play out through letters and memories over the season.
* **Uncertain Fate of Sullivan:** Through hushed conversations, Cameron learns that Sgt. Liam Sullivan has been *relieved of duty* pending disciplinary action. Rumors swirl on base that Sullivan’s unauthorized absence during the Crucible (to rescue the lost recruit) and his earlier bar fight have landed him in the brig (military jail) or worse. Cameron is haunted by their last exchange and the unresolved tension between them. He asks Captain Fajardo about Sullivan’s whereabouts, but she pointedly tells him it’s “out of your hands, Marine.” This leaves Cameron worried – and more determined than ever to live up to the faith Sullivan showed by handing over that radio. **Foreshadowing:** As Cameron boards the transport plane, he glances back, hoping to spot Sullivan one last time on the tarmac. He doesn’t see him… but the camera lingers on a distant figure in dress uniform watching the departing planes. The stage is set: we suspect Sullivan will return, but the when and how remain a mystery.
* **Departure and Reflection:** The episode ends with a montage: Cameron’s plane lifting off as he and dozens of young Marines stare out at the receding California coast. For many, it’s their first time leaving home – now bound for a desert half a world away. Over this montage, Cameron’s voiceover reads the start of a letter he writes to his mom mid-flight. In it, he admits his fear but also his resolve: “**I don’t know what awaits us in Kuwait, but I know why I’m here**,” he writes, alluding both to serving his country and proving himself. In the final shot, Barbara sits at home in Louisiana, clutching a family photo and praying as the news repeats footage of troops deploying. The war – and their family’s part in it – has truly begun.

# Episode 2 – “Desert Shield”

**Synopsis:** Cameron and his unit arrive in Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Shield, joining thousands of coalition troops massing in the desert. This episode immerses us in the stark new environment and reintroduces a familiar face under unexpected circumstances.

* **Sand and Shock:** Stepping off the C-130 cargo plane, Cameron is hit by a blast of hot, dry air. The vast Saudi desert stretches out before the young Marines – tan tents, camouflaged tanks, and endless dunes under a searing sun. It’s a far cry from Parris Island. The friends stick together: Ray cracks a joke about the heat (“I think I’m literally frying in my boots!”), and Joshua “Jonesy” Jones – the sleepwalker recruit they saved during the Crucible – gawks at a **camel** wandering near the airstrip, providing a moment of comic relief. The show takes a brief upbeat tone as the guys attempt to adapt (with some fish-out-of-water humor, like struggling to eat local rations or trading MRE items), highlighting the camaraderie that keeps them sane.
* **Reunited with Sullivan:** On base at Dhahran, Cameron is stunned to encounter **Sgt. Sullivan** once again. In a gripping reveal, Sullivan strides into the Marines’ desert camp as part of a newly arrived contingent of NCOs. It turns out the Marine Corps, facing a potential shooting war, has temporarily reinstated certain disciplined personnel for their combat expertise. Sullivan, a highly decorated Recon Marine, has been given a second chance – he’s assigned to a combat unit in the same region. The moment Cameron sees Sullivan in the chow tent, carrying a tray and looking haunted yet determined, time seems to stop. Cameron’s heart leaps; relief and confusion wash over him. Sullivan notices him too, but strict military bearing keeps their interactions formal in public. Still, a brief exchange of pleasantries while waiting for coffee conveys volumes through subtext. **(Love Dynamic Spark)**: Their eyes meet a second longer than normal; both remember the intimacy of that moonlit forest where Sullivan bared a sliver of his soul to Cameron. Cameron manages a quiet, “Good to see you, *Sir*,” and Sullivan nods, replying, “Good to see you *too*, Marine.” For both men, this deployment suddenly holds new meaning.
* **New Command and Tensions:** The platoon joins **Bravo Company, 1st Battalion** of a Marine Regiment stationed at the front. They meet their company commander, Captain Avery, and platoon leader, Lt. Diaz – tough but earnest officers preparing these green Marines for what may come. Training resumes in the desert: long marches in sand, live-fire exercises, chemical attack drills donning gas masks (a necessary precaution as Saddam Hussein has threatened chemical weapons[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=,p)). Some of the grizzled veterans tease the “boot” Marines, but our core group starts proving themselves. Cameron struggles to fire his rifle accurately in the windy dunes, and one hard-nosed sergeant (not Sullivan) barks at him. Surprisingly, Sullivan steps in with measured advice rather than insults, coaching Cameron on stabilizing his aim in the sand. The veterans watch this interaction with raised eyebrows – why is Sullivan taking special care with this particular Private? Sullivan brusquely assigns Cameron extra target practice at dusk, but when it’s just the two of them, his tone softens: “I’m making sure you’re ready, Cope. War’s coming fast.” Cameron nods, the memory of Sullivan’s past mentorship making him ache to ask more, but they remain professional. Still, the trust rebuilding between them is evident.
* **Letters Home (Homefront I):** Mid-episode, we cut to Barbara back home. She writes her first letter to Cameron at the kitchen table. Through her voiceover, we feel her worry and her effort to stay upbeat for her son. She recounts mundane news – the family dog’s antics, the changing fall leaves – anything to give him a slice of home. But when she pauses, gazing at the **blue star** service flag she’s hung in the window (signifying a child at war), we see her facade falter. In a quiet moment, Barbara attends a support meeting for military families in town. Other parents share updates from their deployed loved ones. One mother mentions her son is “somewhere in Kuwait” and describes the stress of waiting for any news. Barbara, normally private, opens up about Cameron for the first time: “He’s only 17… always wanted to prove himself.” Another parent squeezes her hand. This subplot shows the **solidarity of those left behind**, as Barbara finds strength in community while fearing for her only child.
* **Ending – Storm on the Horizon:** The episode concludes with a scene at night in the Saudi camp. Cameron sits under the stars scribbling a reply to his mom, when Sullivan approaches. In the darkness, away from prying eyes, Sullivan permits a more personal conversation. Cameron thanks Sullivan for helping train him and blurts out, “I’m glad you’re here… Sir.” It’s more than just gratitude – it’s an emotional truth. Sullivan, momentarily dropping his steely guard, admits quietly, “Me too.” He warns Cameron that things will get harder from here: intelligence reports indicate Iraq might dig in and the standoff could turn violent soon if diplomacy fails. They mention President Bush’s ultimatum for Iraq to withdraw by January 15, 1991, or face force[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=In%20real%20life%2C%20President%20Bush,Iraqi%20forces%20didn%27t%20leave%20Kuwait) – a date now only weeks away. Sullivan’s voice wavers almost imperceptibly as he says, “Just…keep your head down out there, Cope.” It’s as close to openly caring as he can get. Cameron promises to watch out, and tentatively adds, “You too, Liam,” using Sullivan’s first name for the first time. Sullivan doesn’t reprimand him for the breach of protocol – instead, he offers a faint smile before departing into the shadows. The camera lingers on Cameron’s face, which is equal parts fear and hope as he realizes how much he cares about Sullivan’s safety. War is looming, and their connection – however undefined – will be tested like never before.

# Episode 3 – “Brothers in the Sand”

**Synopsis:** As 1990 turns to 1991, the Marines settle into a tense routine in the Saudi desert, forging bonds and facing the mental strain of waiting for a war to start. This episode focuses on camaraderie and the emotional toll of living in limbo, interwoven with moments that further deepen Sullivan and Cameron’s relationship against the backdrop of secrecy.

* **Band of Brothers:** The platoon’s daily life at the front is a mix of grinding preparation and boredom. We see the guys fortify defensive positions, dig foxholes, and run drills, but also play cards by flashlight and celebrate New Year’s Eve 1991 with non-alcoholic near-beer and sardonic toasts (“Happy New Year in the middle of nowhere!” quips Ray). During downtime, character backstories emerge: Ray confides in Cameron that he’s determined to prove himself to his father – a Vietnam vet – by earning commendations in this conflict. Jonesy, the formerly sleepwalking recruit, lightens the mood by reading aloud a funny letter from his little sister, making everyone laugh about a mis-transcribed address that had his mail sent to “Saudi *Indiana*” by mistake. These lighthearted moments serve to humanize the Marines, showing their youth and the strong **friendships** developing under duress.
* **Sullivan’s Burden:** Sullivan, though still officially with another unit, frequently interacts with Cameron’s platoon – ostensibly to help train or share intel. But we get private glimpses of Sullivan alone that reveal his inner turmoil. In one scene, Sullivan sits on his cot late at night, looking at a worn photograph of a man tucked in his notebook. This subtle hint – that Sullivan had (or has) someone he loved – ties back to Season 1’s implications about his sexuality[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=The%20actor%20continued%2C%20,things%20and%20for%20being%20gay). He quickly hides the photo when another sergeant passes by. It’s clear Sullivan lives in fear of exposure even here, and the war’s uncertainty only amplifies his desire to set things right in his life. Later, Captain Avery reminds Sullivan that once this conflict is over, his pending investigation will resume – war is only a temporary reprieve for him. Sullivan nods stiffly, understanding that heroics on the battlefield might be his only shot at redeeming his career or at least leaving with honor.
* **A Confidante for Cameron:** One quiet evening, Cameron and Ray share guard duty under a starry sky. In a heartfelt conversation, Cameron finally confesses that he’s been struggling with something personal. He doesn’t outright say he’s gay, but he dances around it: “Ray, have you ever felt…different, and afraid people wouldn’t accept you if they knew?” Ray, perceptive and loyal, replies gently, “You know I got your back no matter what, right?” He mentions that in boot camp he noticed Sullivan seemed to single Cameron out, but not out of malice – perhaps out of protectiveness. Ray suspects the truth about Cameron (and maybe Sullivan, though he doesn’t vocalize it), and in this moment affirms their friendship: “Whatever *it* is, you’re not alone.” Cameron is visibly relieved, emotion in his eyes, and he simply says “Thank you.” It’s a touching scene of acceptance. **(Love Dynamic)**: This also pushes Cameron closer to acknowledging his feelings about Sullivan. Ray’s friendship gives him courage; he even drafts an unsent letter to Sullivan in his journal that night – pouring out gratitude and longing in words he could never speak aloud. Though he never intends to show it, writing the letter is cathartic and foreshadows a deeper confession down the line.
* **Homefront II – Fears and Faith:** Back in Louisiana, Barbara’s storyline progresses. She’s now receiving Cameron’s letters, which are cautiously optimistic and full of generic reassurances (“I’m safe and with my buddies, don’t worry”). Barbara reads these at the dinner table, visibly comforted just to have his words. Yet, a scare comes when a televised news report shows footage of a **Scud missile attack** near Dhahran where U.S. troops are based. Barbara’s heart stops – that’s where Cameron mentioned he was! In reality, the report might be referencing incidents like the missile strikes Iraq launched in January[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=Image%3A%20,HeadLine)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=ATTACK%20ON%20BAGHDAD%20IN%20THE,HeadLine). Barbara frantically calls the Marine Corps information line for families and is told there’s no news of casualties in her son’s unit. This sequence portrays the rollercoaster of fear military families endure. That Sunday in church, Barbara lights a candle for Cameron’s safety. Vera Farmiga’s portrayal would shine here, as Barbara steels herself with quiet prayers and a resolve to stay strong for her son. **Symbolism:** She begins assembling a care package – including a photo of the family and homemade cookies – tangible love sent across the miles.
* **Clandestine Connection:** Near episode’s end, Sullivan secretly approaches Cameron with a risky proposition: he has a short-wave radio receiver and invites Cameron (and Ray, as cover) to listen to BBC news with him, away from the camp hustle. In a hidden corner behind supply crates, the three huddle quietly as static-laced broadcasts detail diplomatic talks failing and the UN deadline for Iraq’s withdrawal nearing. After Ray leaves, thanking Sullivan, an unspoken moment passes between Cameron and Sullivan. Cameron softly says, “Whatever happens… I’m glad we’re here together.” Sullivan struggles with his response, eyes heavy with concern. Instead of words, he places a firm hand on Cameron’s shoulder, letting it linger just a second longer than protocol permits. It’s a gesture of solidarity and something more personal. Both men are acutely aware of their surroundings, so they part with just that touch. But in that brief contact, a line is crossed – an acknowledgement of affection that goes beyond camaraderie. Each walks away with a mix of solace and yearning. We, as the audience, feel the **quiet burn of their suppressed love**, intensifying as the drums of war begin to thunder on the horizon.

# Episode 4 – “Flashpoint”

**Synopsis:** In this mid-season peak, the Gulf War officially begins. The episode covers the transition from tense anticipation to the outbreak of hostilities in January 1991. It intertwines explosive action with personal crises, as characters face the real prospect of death and discovery.

* **Operation Desert Storm – Air War Begins:** The deadline passes without Iraqi retreat, and in the early hours of January 17, 1991, Operation Desert Storm is launched[people.com](https://people.com/boots-show-ending-explained-netflix-11829288#:~:text=In%20real%20life%2C%20President%20Bush,Iraqi%20forces%20didn%27t%20leave%20Kuwait). Cameron’s unit is awakened before dawn by sirens and the distant thunder of jets. The sky to the north lights up as coalition aircraft strike Iraqi targets. Anti-aircraft tracer fire is seen on the horizon, and the Marines watch in a mix of awe and trepidation[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-gulf-war-idJPRTXAOZG/#:~:text=Image%3A%20,HeadLine). The desert night suddenly feels very real and very dangerous. Orders come down for all troops to don MOPP gear (chemical protective suits and gas masks) due to fears of an Iraqi chemical counterattack. We see the platoon hurriedly suiting up, injecting nerve-agent antidote injectors into their thighs prophylactically, hands shaking. Cameron’s terror is palpable as he fumbles with his gas mask straps, remembering training about how a single mistake could be fatal. Sullivan appears, calmly helping secure Cameron’s mask and reminding him to breathe steadily. In a muffled voice through the mask, Sullivan quips, “Can’t have you passing out on me.” Even in chaos, their bond is a source of steadiness.
* **Scud Alert:** Shortly after, an alarm sounds – incoming missile. The base scrambles; everyone dives into bunkers as a SCUD missile launched by Iraq streaks overhead. A **distant boom** follows. Thankfully, it lands far from the Marine camp (perhaps intercepted by a Patriot missile or simply missing its mark). The Marines endure the scare crouched together in dark trenches. In one trench, Cameron huddles next to Ray, who mutters a nervous joke about wishing he’d brought the lucky rabbit’s foot his girlfriend gave him. Across the way, Sullivan leads another fire team in prayer as dirt shakes from the impact. This sequence ratchets up tension, showing that **even before ground combat, the war is perilous**. After all-clear, the camera pans over dust-covered, wide-eyed young Marines – a collective sigh of relief that they’re still alive.
* **The Pressure Mounts:** Over the next days, the air war rages. The Marines aren’t yet in direct combat, but they feel the reverberations – literally (through nightly airstrike rumbles) and mentally (knowing the invasion is imminent). Some struggle with anxiety and fear of the unknown. One recruit, Pvt. Hicks, freezes up during a live-fire drill, overwhelmed by the sound of nearby bombing runs. He admits to Cameron later that he isn’t sure he’ll be brave when the bullets start flying for real. Cameron, grappling with his own fear, nonetheless steps into a supportive role: he reminds Hicks that they all got through the Crucible together and that they’ll watch out for each other in battle too. This conversation shows Cameron growing into a leadership role among his peers – a sign of his maturation.
* **Sullivan in Danger of Exposure:** Meanwhile, an external threat looms for Sullivan. A new intelligence officer arrives at camp – **Lieutenant Miller**, tasked with gathering any compromising information on troops (especially regarding potential security risks). Unbeknownst to Sullivan, Miller has been briefed on the prior investigation into Sullivan’s personal life. We see Miller leafing through a confidential dossier containing Sullivan’s name with the word “**Article 125**” (the code for the military’s ban on homosexual conduct at the time) circled. The war hasn’t erased bigotry within the ranks. In a tense scene, Miller subtly interrogates Sullivan under the guise of checking unit morale. He pointedly asks if Sullivan has anyone special waiting back home and whether he spends a lot of time with “his boys” in the platoon. Sullivan, knowing exactly what’s happening, maintains a poker face and curtly answers that his only focus is the mission. But the encounter leaves him shaken – the threat of being outed *during* a war is a cruel shadow hanging over him. **Stakes Raise:** Sullivan is now fighting on two fronts: the external war and the internal battle to keep his true self hidden.
* **Battle of Khafji (Cliffhanger):** As January nears its end, Iraqi forces launch a surprise move across the border, leading to the **Battle of Khafji** (a real Gulf War engagement around January 29, 1991). Cameron’s platoon is sent forward as part of a force to repel a sudden Iraqi incursion into the Saudi town of Al-Khafji at night. The episode’s latter half becomes an intense combat sequence – the first taste of ground battle for our characters. Tracer bullets whip across the streets of the town as the Marines, alongside Saudi and coalition forces, engage in urban firefights. Cameron sticks close to Ray and their fire team, clearing building by building. In a heart-stopping moment, they take fire from Iraqi soldiers holed up in a second-story window. Pinned behind a wall, Cameron hears that one of their buddies, Hicks, is hit in the open. Without hesitation, he and Ray dash out under fire to drag Hicks to cover, much like Cameron once carried a wounded recruit in training. They succeed, but Cameron finds himself separated from his unit in the smoky chaos, just as more Iraqi reinforcements counterattack. At this critical juncture, **Sullivan appears through the haze** with his Recon squad, having arrived to reinforce the Marines. He locks eyes with Cameron in relief (“I’ve got you, Marine!” he shouts), and together they regroup the scattered men. Sullivan’s leadership and Cameron’s bravery turn the tide in their sector – we see them fighting almost back-to-back at one point, protecting each other in a hail of gunfire. The Marines ultimately reclaim Khafji by dawn, but not without cost: Hicks survives his wound, though badly injured, and is evacuated. Several others are not so lucky; the sight of flag-draped bodies being loaded for transport is sobering. Cameron, hands trembling after the adrenaline fades, realizes he has blood on his uniform – some his own (minor shrapnel cuts), some from carrying Hicks. Sullivan checks on him, briefly touching Cameron’s cheek under the guise of wiping dirt off, and quietly praises him: “You did good, son.” It’s the first time Sullivan has ever used a fatherly tone, and it nearly brings Cameron to tears on the spot.
* **Emotional Cliffhanger:** As medics carry away the wounded and the company regroups, a photographer snaps a shot of Sullivan and Cameron standing amidst the rubble, the younger Marine looking up at the sergeant with weary, profound respect. (This could mirror iconic wartime photography). The episode ends on a cliffhanger back home: Barbara sees a breaking news report about the Battle of Khafji and scans the footage anxiously. In one grainy news photo flashed on screen, she **recognizes Cameron’s face** among the Marines in Kuwait – dirty, exhausted, but alive and doing his duty. The episode cuts to black as Barbara gasps in relief and collapses into sobs, the emotional toll of worry and pride overwhelming her. The war has now fully erupted, and nothing will be the same for these characters.

I don't recommend anyone else try this with me without consulting a professional first. The foods seem harmless, but this could for example--cause interaction with medications/substances or other problems, depending on your own baseline (as we'll not all be the same.) This a reboot sequence for the gut flora. This is based on recent research in \*MICE\*. Kennedy's mouse-model study provides a clear four-stage roadmap, emphasizing diet-driven restoration after severe microbiome disruption. The timelines for mice do \*not\* map onto humans, so I will be using an interoceptive/holistic approach--rather than projecting rigid timelines.

Establishing a baseline:  
Age: 43. Gender: M General health: Overall good health, but with depleted microbiome. Recent antibiotics: No. I am NOT pregnant, lactating, immunocompromised, or on medications that I expect to interact with these foods/supplements. I will stop and consult a clinician if concerning symptoms occur.

**Phase 1: Pioneer Colonizers (Resistant starches; Gentle prebiotics)**

Staples:

\- Potatoes (bulk bag)

\- Oats (bulk)

\- Dried beans (variety if possible)

\- Apples (cooked; whatever's cheap)

Method:

\- Cook potatoes/rice, let cool overnight in fridge

\- Eat cold or reheated (resistant starch forms when cooled)

\- Oatmeal (let it cool a bit before eating)

\- Beans (cook big batch, store)

Goal: Trying to stabilize digestion

**Phase 2: Network Builders (Inulin sources; FOS sources)**

Add:

\- Onions

\- Garlic

\- Leeks (if affordable)

\- Slightly green bananas

Signal to add Phase 2:

\- Phase 1 foods feel comfortable

\- Digestion stabilizing

\- Body says ""ready for more""

Goal: So, this is the fart phase... Is restoration worth it?

**Phase 3: Competitive Exclusion**

Add:

\- N-Acetyl-Cysteine supplement 600-1200mg/day (when you can afford it)

\- Lactoferrin (harder to source, skip unless affordable)

\- Maybe sauerkraut/fermented foods (if tolerated)

Signal:

\- Feeling plateau in progress

\- Ready to address pathogens

\- Cravings shifting

Goal: Dismantle pathogenic biofilms, let beneficial microbes dominate

**Phase 4: Keystone Stabilization (Polyphenols)**

Add:

\- Dark berries (frozen cheapest)

\- Green tea/coffee

\- Cranberries when on sale

\- Pomegranate (optional)

Signal:

\- Everything feels integrated

\- Ready to stabilize/maintain

Hypothesis being: By the time I get to phase 4, I should notice:

\- Improved gut health

\- Improved mental health

\- Improved physical resilience",1,1761878796.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

No tricks, only treats - just two humans trying to make the most of spooky season before the Mariah Carey Christmas takeover begins.

I’m also totally open to other plans — exploring the city, trying out your favorite food spot, or just finding a quiet corner to talk and see if we click. It’s really about the connection — meeting someone genuine to share a few laughs and good vibes with.

A bit about me -

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

1okjchn,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1okjchn/hes_powerful_and_admired_but_treated_me_terribly/,He’s powerful and admired but treated me terribly. Was this abuse?,"I (32F) got involved with a somewhat older and very successful man (43M) who works in the same industry as me. He’s well known and respected, which made the connection feel exciting and validating at first. I met him at a professional event and asked for advice about my career. He was friendly and generous, said we should grab coffee, and asked for my number so his assistant could set it up. At that time, my ask was strictly professional. I didn't have any romantic or physical attraction to him.

Over the next month, he kept rescheduling our Zoom calls, then started texting me directly. At first, the messages were light and friendly. Then it became every day, small check-ins. Like asking about my day. How my workout was. How my evening was going. Was I looking forward to my next gig in NYC. It all seemed very innocent on the surface, but I felt there was more going on. However, I didn't want to assume.

When I came back to NYC for work, he insisted we have dinner. It was storming that night, so he invited me to his place to order in. I was nervous but agreed. The night started off light, but there was tension building between us. He’d touch my leg when making a point or hold eye contact a little too long. I finally asked if there was something happening between us, and he acted confused. He said he was just a friendly person, and it was common for him to ""touch"" his friends. I remember feeling embarrassed and said maybe I should just go. That’s when he suddenly asked if I wanted to have sex with him. I hesitated and said “maybe.” He asked again, and when I said “yes,” he kissed me. Things escalated quickly. He became very passionate, almost like he had been holding back for weeks. It felt intense and disorienting.

After that, we started seeing each other, and it got confusing fast. He introduced a “Daddy/baby” dynamic that I didn’t ask for but went along with. He could be warm and affectionate, then distant or cruel. He would encourage me in my career and offer really great advice. He'd check-in on me, congratulate me, express how proud he was of me. How beautiful he thought I was and how intelligent I was. But he also yelled at me, accused me of “victimizing” myself when I cried, and made degrading jokes about things we had done. He also crossed physical boundaries in ways that scared me, like grabbing my face when I spoke during an argument. He told me I made him act the way he did. That I was pulling it out of him, making him act ""not like himself"", and that his ego was too big to deal with me. It was emotionally exhausting and ruined some of my confidence.

I finally blocked him a few weeks ago after he told me he was “done with me” during an argument, then started texting me again like nothing happened. Going no contact has helped a bit, but I still feel hooked emotionally and physically. Everyone else sees him as this brilliant, admired person, and I feel like I met someone completely different.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Especially when the person had power or influence? How do I let go and stop questioning myself? And I'm not sure if what I experienced was abuse or not. It's confusing.",8,1761878703.0,abusiverelationships,4,1.0,False

I spend about $700 a month plus or minus $50 as a single male. I lift regularly and eat about 3k calories daily for my workout program. I live in a moderate cost of living area and one thing I need to clarify is that I only eat and drink what I buy at the grocery store. No breakfast or lunch runs for work, no gas station energy drinks or coffee shops and I maybe eat out once or twice a month which accounts for the plus or minus $50.

1okj8fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1okj8fx/life_advice_stop_being_mysterious_on_purpose_how/,[Life Advice] Stop being “mysterious” on purpose: how social isolation is killing your vibe (and your health),"Been seeing this a lot lately. People my age, mid-20s to early 30s, talking about how they “don't have the energy” to talk to friends, or how texting back feels like a chore, or how they ghost people not out of malice but because they “just can’t deal.” And then scrolling through TikTok, you’ll find entire communities romanticizing being the “quiet loner” with zero friends and a mysterious aura. 

But here’s the truth: being socially disconnected isn’t an aesthetic. It’s a slow-motion train wreck for your mental and physical health. No, you’re not just introverted. You might be socially malnourished.

This post is a reality check meets toolkit. It’s based on real research, actual psychology, and real-world advice from experts who’ve studied human behavior and loneliness for decades. Not just some viral “that girl” influencer telling you to “protect your energy” by cutting off everyone and living in isolation with your matcha and crystals. 

Let’s be clear: if you're feeling disconnected, it's not your fault. Modern life has made it dangerously easy to avoid people, and the algorithm rewards disengagement. But the good news is that social skills can be rebuilt, and happiness can be recovered. Here’s how.

- A Harvard study that tracked people for over 80 years (yes, *80*) found that the #1 predictor of happiness and longevity wasn’t money, career success, or even physical health—it was the quality of relationships. Robert Waldinger, director of the study, said in his TED Talk that “good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Full stop.”

- Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, called loneliness the next public health crisis. In his 2023 advisory, he said lacking social connection is as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Yeah, fifteen. Daily. That’s how bad isolation is for your body and mind.

- Neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman, author of *Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect*, argues that social interaction isn’t optional—it’s a basic human need, like food and water. When we don’t get enough, our brain goes into survival mode. That’s why loneliness can feel like physical pain.

So what can you actually *do* to reconnect with people, even when it feels awkward, exhausting, or pointless? Here’s the no-BS game plan.

- Call instead of text. Voice calls are scientifically more fulfilling because they engage more of your brain’s social circuits. A study from the University of Texas found that hearing someone’s voice creates stronger emotional bonds than texting does. Even a 5-minute check-in call can do more for your connection than a month of gray bubble texts.

- Say hi to strangers. At the coffee shop. At the grocery store. To your barista. These micro-interactions matter more than you think. Research from the University of British Columbia shows that casual chats with strangers significantly improve your mood and sense of belonging. It’s not small talk, it’s social nutrition.

- Make the plan. Don’t wait to be invited. The “no one ever reaches out to me” loop is a trap. Be the one who initiates. Even if it flops, you exercised your social agency, which builds confidence. People are generally way more open to connecting than you assume.

- Stop overthinking how you come across. Social anxiety often comes from hyper-self-focus. But a meta-analysis from the American Psychological Association shows that people walk away from social interactions liking you *more* than you think. This is called the “liking gap.” You’re not awkward. You’re just overthinking it.

- Don’t aim to be interesting. Aim to be interested. Dale Carnegie said it best in *How to Win Friends and Influence People*: “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.” Ask questions. Be curious. People remember how you made them feel.

- Have recurring plans. One-off hangouts are great, but recurring ones build real bonds. A monthly dinner. A weekly walk. A group chat that leads to real-world events. Consistency is what creates depth.

- Stop assuming people don’t want to hear from you. This assumption kills most connections before they begin. A study in *Nature Human Behaviour* found that people significantly underestimate how much others appreciate being reached out to. Send the text. Make the call. They’re probably waiting too.

- Build a “low-maintenance” friend list. These are the people you can talk to once every few months and pick up where you left off. Don’t ghost them. Reach out when the thought comes to mind. It doesn’t have to be deep. Just a “hey, thinking about you” goes a long way.

- Consider leaving group chats that drain you. Not all social interaction is healthy. You need *meaningful* connection, not constant noise. Quality > quantity. It’s okay to curate your social environment.

- Practice “social reps.” Like going to the gym, consistency builds social muscle. Start small. Say hi to your neighbor. Compliment someone’s outfit. These reps build familiarity and reduce social fear over time.

- Use tech intentionally, not passively. Social media can *simulate* connection without actually giving you any. Rule of thumb: if you're not actively chatting with someone or making plans, you're consuming—not connecting.

- Read *Lost Connections* by Johann Hari. This book breaks down how modern life has severed us from real relationships, and what we can do to rebuild them. It’s a must-read if you’ve been feeling isolated but can’t explain why.

- Watch the episode “What Makes a Good Life?” by The School of Life on YouTube. It’s short, deep, and brutally honest. It explains why intimacy isn’t a luxury—it’s a survival need.

- Stop labeling yourself as “anti-social” or “awkward.” Those labels become self-fulfilling. You’re not broken. You’re probably just out of practice.

Loneliness doesn’t look like crying alone in your room. It looks like endlessly scrolling. Ghosting friends back. Avoiding calls. Telling yourself you’re “just too tired” when actually, you're socially starved.

You don’t need a huge circle. You just need real connection. So yeah, talk to people. Call people. Say hi. Make the plan. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to show up.

Your happiness literally depends on it.

On Wednesday, I attended the Pompano Beach CRA/commission meeting.

One of the complaints about the downtown project has been that it won’t make residents’ lives better, so a proposed resolution was to dedicate $6.5 million over the course of 10 years to “bettering” the lives of residents.

**The “benefits” include:**

* Rental assistance in the form of first, last and security
* Down payment assistance for prospective homeowners
* Vocational training in “AI” and “tech” (Because people need a way to make money, if they’re going to get rental assistance because it’s not an ongoing subsidy)
* Tiny homes
* Small business incubator, which they’d give market rental rates to businesses in their program, so these SMBs would be businesses, like coffee shops or retailers
* Community festivals and events (Seriously? What a benefit! Especially when the majority of people won’t be able to afford to attend them!)
* Youth sports leagues
* College scholarships

Hey everyone!

I’ve never used commercial espresso equipment before, but I’m about to start a new job soon where I’ll be working on a high-end Italian espresso machine (I’ll get the exact name from my boss, but it’s around the $6k range). I’m super excited, but also a little nervous because I feel like my milk steaming technique still isn’t where it should be.

I’m completely self-taught — I’ve never been trained by a professional or a seasoned barista before. I’ve watched tons of tutorials online and practiced a lot, but I still struggle with getting good texture.

I used a Breville Barista Express when I worked on a coffee truck, and now I have a Casabrew CM5418™ at home. I can get that “vortex” motion everyone talks about, but my milk still turns out thin. It basically sinks straight to the bottom, and I don’t get that creamy, glossy microfoam. Definitely not enough texture to even attempt latte art.

I usually steam oat milk, but I’ve tested with whole milk too and get the same results — so I don’t think it’s just the milk.

Is this more likely an issue with my technique, or just the limitations of a cheaper home machine?
And any tips for improving texture or adapting before I start using a commercial machine would be super appreciated 🙏",3,1761877414.0,barista,3,1.0,False

That’s why lately, I have been obsessed with the idea of self-care baskets, they are such a simple but thoughtful way to take care of yourself or someone you love.

I recently put together my ideas on **Self care Basket Ideas** that covers how to create themed baskets for every mood, personality, and budget. Whether you’re making one for yourself or putting together a thoughtful gift, there’s something special for everyone. Honestly, it's one of the most satisfying DIYs I’ve done.

You can go in so many directions with these baskets depending on personality or mood. For example:

* **Relaxation & Spa Basket:** Bath bombs, scented candles, luxurious body oils, bubble bath. Add a soft towel or soothing music playlist, and it’s the perfect kit for anyone who needs to unwind and relax after a tiring day.
* **Cozy Night-In Basket:** Fuzzy socks, herbal tea, a comfy blanket, and fairy lights. Include a good book or journal to make it extra comforting for nights when you just want to recharge quietly.
* **For skincare lovers** – A nice mix of a face mask, moisturizer, lip balm, and gua sha tool. It’s a small but pampering way to help someone glow and feel refreshed.
* **For creative minds** – Paint sets, calligraphy pens, puzzles, or DIY kits. Perfect for those who love relaxing through art or hands-on hobbies.
* **For the foodie friend** – Snacks, coffee, chocolates, and a cute mug. You can even toss in a gourmet treat or baking mix for a cozy weekend activity.
* **Stress-Relief Basket:** Perfect for easing daily stress. Aromatherapy diffusers, mindfulness or guided meditation cards, coloring books for adults, and soothing teas to calm anxious minds.
* **Tech-Lover’s Basket:** Smart gadgets and cozy accessories like wireless sleep headphones, blue light blocking glasses, a self-heating coffee mug, LED therapy lights, mini  massagers and many more for gadget enthusiasts who love their tech but need a break too.

It’s really fun to mix and match stuff or keep it themed. You can also personalize them with a handwritten note or the person’s favorite scent or color.

Hope is a skittish thing,

Like prey that slips my clutches.

I unclasp my hands to see only my empty palms

And it’s already miles away.

As I collapse starving,

Dejected in a barren tundra,

It waddles up beside me.

Infuriating little beast!

-

But a sweet and loving creature-

It returns with a few crumbs to sustain me,

Bearing a tender heart.

Though I don’t appreciate its sense of humor.

-

Yet the fault may be all mine.

For, like a fool, I search for it

Buried under the depths of cold despair

Or far inside the darkest caverns of terror.

-

When I know where it lives

Buzzing around a hot mug of coffee at my mom’s house,

Attracted to the chimes of laughter at family dinners,

Or looking to feast on the falling dust as I brush myself off

Don’t know how the typo happened but I originally put (29M) but he is (49M) we had a 22 year age gap! 

I think I’ve found the right subreddit for this post 🥲 I fear I’ve been naive and found the reason this man couldn’t find a woman his age to date him. In the beginning, he cited his relationships with women my age being due to the fact he didn’t want marriage/kids. In the end, I think it’s his immaturity. 

I (26F) started dating this man (49M) two years ago. I had reservations about the age gap, but then again I never really fit in with my peers and he was so nice, caring and nurturing towards me & I needed that badly at the time. 

Over the last 2 years, we’ve shared a pretty stable and healthy relationship compared to what I’m used to. There were times he’d get defensive, withdrawal, or have angry outbursts against himself that scared me - but never were directed at me. 

What ultimately turned me off to him was the small, subtle “jokes” and remarks he’d make at my expense. The last one being a remark about the seltzer cans I’d left on my coffee table - joking I’d been on a “bender” and pointing them out first thing after entering my home. 

When confronted he wrote it off as “just a bad joke” or being “unintentionally critical because he’s been depressed” but to me - I ultimately read it as disrespect. I did try to laugh along and “not be hurt by everything he does” as he said, but why should I do that? 

He had me feeling at times that it was my sensitivity and reactions to his disrespect that was the reason we couldn’t just have a good time - which was so confusing compared to the “misunderstood good guy” he made himself out to be. 

He was consistent, loving and could provide for me in some ways. People in my life are disappointed in me that I let him go. But I think there are better men who can help themselves and not do this kind of thing and if I never find them 🤷‍♀️ I feel that would be okay too. 

In your experience, does this behavior ever go away for men? Am I throwing away something good as far as how men can be? Have you ever regretted leaving a man for something small yet seemingly important? Accepting your wisdom and experience with gratitude  🙏 ",3,1761877169.0,AskWomenOver40,32,0.64,False
