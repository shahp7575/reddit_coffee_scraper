[Sunlight streams through the window of Sarah Miller's bedroom as she wakes up. The clock reads 7:08. Her hair is dyed blue at the tips, and punk band posters cover the walls. She gets up annoyed and walks down the hall, banging loudly on the door of her father's messy room.]

Sarah: WAKE THE FUCK UP! THE ALARM'S BEEN GOING OFF FOR HALF AN HOUR!

[Joel stirs in bed, wearing only boxers. He grunts, clearly in a bad mood.]

Sarah: YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE AGAIN, DAMN IT!

[In the kitchen, Sarah scrambles eggs while heavy music plays on the radio. She rummages through the cabinets violently. Joel comes downstairs, buttoning his pants with a scowl on his face.]

Sarah: Where the hell’s the pancake mix?

Joel: [Irritated] I was gonna buy it yesterday, but thanks to your little fight at school, I had to go talk to the principal. Again!

Sarah: [Rolling her eyes] I was gonna make pancakes for your birthday. But whatever, right?

Joel: [Heavily sighing] You know I don’t even like pancakes.

Sarah: [With a sarcastic smile] I know. They were for me, you selfish ass.

[Joel pours coffee. Sarah fills a glass with orange juice and practically shoves it at Joel.]

Sarah: Vitamin C. If you’re not gonna take care of yourself, someone’s gotta do it.

[Joel glares at the juice, takes a sip, makes a face, and grabs the coffee instead. He watches Sarah cook in silence.]

Joel: [Accusingly] Did you finish that homework you were behind on? The fractions? [Sarah shoots him a deadly look.]

Sarah: [Sarcastically] Sure, Dad. I also cleaned the bathroom, donated to charity, and confessed my sins. Happy?

[Later, they eat in silence at the kitchen table.]

Sarah: How old are you again, old man?

Joel: Thirty-six.

Sarah: You’re gonna need diapers soon, huh?

Joel: [Dead serious] Who says I don’t already?

[Joel chews the eggs and pulls something out of his mouth.]

Joel: Eggshell.

Sarah: [Mouth full, grinning] Calcium, bitch! Good for the osteoporosis that’s coming!

Joel: [Dryly] Lovely.

[The sound of the garage door opening is heard.]

Joel: Is there enough food for your Uncle Tommy?

Sarah: [Mocking] There would be if I’d been warned...

[Tommy Miller enters through the garage door, wearing a black suit and holding a Bible.]

Tommy: [Solemnly] Good morning, brothers in Christ! [Slaps Joel on the back] Still alive, sinner?

Sarah: [Sarcastically] Awww, how he loves you.

Joel: [Dryly] He’s financially dependent on me, it’s not the same.

Sarah: It’s the same shit.

Tommy: [Opening the Bible] It’s definitely the same. Joel, when are you gonna accept Jesus? [Looks at the table] I thought we’d have pancakes, like the Last Supper!

[Joel throws his hands up, exasperated.]

Joel: [Irritated] Don’t start with the preaching this early! We’ll grab something on the road. Are the concrete guys gonna be there?

Tommy: [Putting the Bible away] They said ""maybe."" God will provide.

Joel: [Furious] Maybe? We can’t frame until we pour the concrete, and we don’t get paid until we frame!

Tommy: We could bring in someone else, finish the job faster.

Joel: No, absolutely not! I already don’t wanna split with you, my own brother. We’ll just work overtime.

Sarah: [Indignant] Seriously? Today? On your birthday? That sucks!

Joel: [To Sarah] Watch your mouth! I know, I’ll be done by nine. [To Tommy] By nine, right?

Tommy: [Making the sign of the cross] God willing.

Joel: I’ll bring a cake, I promise.

[Sarah continues eating but stops when she hears a news report on the radio.]

Reporter: ...ongoing unrest in Jakarta, we advise American citizens to avoid the area...

Joel: Jakarta. Where’s that, the Middle East?

Tommy: [Quickly] Surely it’s the devil’s territory! Idolaters! We must pray for them...

Sarah: [Interrupting] Jakarta isn’t a country, you idiot. It’s the capital of Indonesia, in Asia. You should read something other than that Bible someday.

[Joel looks at Sarah, torn between pride and irritation at her tone.]

Tommy: [Adjusting his tie] There’s still hope for this rebellious young lady! God enlightens even the most lost!

[Joel checks his wrist for a watch, slaps it in frustration, and grabs his pager to check the time. He starts clearing the table.]

Joel: Hurry up, we gotta drop you off at school.

Sarah: [Mouth full] I’m still eating this shitty egg!

Joel: [Strictly] Seven minutes, Sarah. And watch your language!

[Joel puts the plate in the sink.]

Sarah: Your shirt’s inside out, genius.

[Joel checks and realizes she’s right.]

Joel: Shit!

[Tommy, eating the leftovers, watches Joel with a mix of pity and devotion.]

Tommy: [To Sarah] He’s losing his way. We need to bring him back to the light.

[Sarah rolls her eyes. Later, she grabs her backpack and checks if Joel is coming. She sneaks into her father’s room, turns off the fan, and opens a drawer, finding a broken watch and a wad of cash. She takes her father’s razor and examines it. She opens the blade and runs her finger along the edge. The sound of the truck horn honking outside startles her.]

Joel: [Yelling] SARAH! LET’S GO!

[Sarah quickly puts the razor back and takes the watch and money. Outside, she locks the house door and walks to the truck.]

Danny: [Voice from afar] Hey, neighbor!

Sarah: [Switching to a sweet tone] Oh, hi, Danny!

[The Millers' neighbor, Danny Adler, is sitting outside feeding his mother-in-law in a wheelchair. He’s wearing a black shirt with subtle neo-Nazi symbols.]

Danny: [With a slight German accent] Connie was asking about you, since you haven’t been around lately.

[Sarah looks at Joel, who stops loading the truck. He looks back at his daughter suspiciously.]

Joel: [Forced] Go on, make them happy.

[Joel walks away. Sarah turns to the neighbors with a genuine smile.]

Sarah: [Excited] I can come by after school! But just for a little while, okay?

Danny: [With a sinister smile] She’ll take whatever time she can get! You can... bake cookies or whatever. [Joel returns to the truck] Speaking of which... [Grabs a tray of cookies] We’ve got plenty extra. You guys want some cookies? They’re a recipe from my homeland.

Sarah: [Excited] Dad, you love cookies!

[Joel looks just in time to see Danny feeding the elderly woman, who mutters something that sounds like a spell. His expression hardens.]

Joel: [Dryly] I do... but I’m on a diet.

Danny: [Confused] A what?

Joel: [Nervously] Uh... look, we gotta go, but Sarah will come by later and stay as long as you want! [Closes the truck bed] She can explain diets! [Opens the back door for Sarah]

Danny: [Smirking] Great! I’ll let Connie know. She’s got new books to show you, Sarah. About racial purity...

Sarah: [To Joel, excitedly] Cool!

[Sarah gets in the truck. Tommy adjusts himself, a lit cigarette in his mouth.]

Tommy: [Opening the Bible again] I can’t tell you how thrilling it was to hear that conversation with those pagans.

Joel: [Irritated] Put that shit out! And put the Bible away!

[Tommy takes the cigarette out of his mouth and flicks it out the window.]

Tommy: [Sarcastically] Happy birthday to you, sinner.

[The engine starts, revealing a bumper sticker that reads ""Desert Storm Combat Veteran."" The truck pulls out of the garage.]

Joel: [Quietly, to Sarah] I don’t want you around that damn Nazi and that voodoo witch.

Sarah: [Defiantly] And I don’t want a fanatical preacher trying to convert me. We all have our problems, huh?

[The truck drives off. Text reveals: Austin, Texas, September 26, 2003. Later, Sarah is taking notes in a classroom, drawing swastikas and occult symbols in the margins of her notebook with a smile on her face.]
[Sarah is taking notes in a classroom. She’s drawing Nazi symbols and pentagrams in the margins of her notebook instead of paying attention.]

Mrs. Lauterstein: I want you to copy this diagram exactly as it is on the board. [Sarah checks the clock: 2:25 PM] Always subject and predicate; verb and noun. Right, the sentence is ""Where are you going?"" The subject is you. ""You... are going."" Predicate. Where, adverb. See? Okay. I see some nods and head shakes. I swear you’ll use this later in life. Believe me, that’s why you’re here. So, use the subject—

[The audio begins to fade as ominous music plays. One student’s hand trembles, another coughs. The bell rings, and students start packing up to leave.]

Mrs. Lauterstein: Yes, you need to know this! Yes, this will be on next week’s test! The homework is due at the end of class tomorrow!

[Sarah flips off the teacher discreetly as she leaves the room.]

[Cut to Sarah leaving school and boarding a city bus. She looks out the window at the urban landscape of Austin as the bus moves. A man sitting nearby starts preaching about the apocalypse. Sarah puts on her headphones to ignore him. Later, she gets off at a store called Lone Star Watches & Jewelry, a watch and jewelry repair shop. Inside, the owner Nasir inspects Joel’s watch and offers Sarah a price.]

Nasir: Twenty.

Sarah: [Disgusted] That’s it? This shit’s worth way more.

Nasir: [Shocked by her language] Okay, thirty.

Sarah: [Smirking] Twenty’s fine, sucker.

Nasir: It just needs a spring. I’ll do it right now.

[He turns and starts repairing Joel’s watch. A phone rings as Sarah starts looking around the store, picking up and examining items carelessly. Police cars and fire trucks with sirens pass by outside.]

Nasir: All day. I swear.

[A woman who co-owns the store, Tahira, enters from the back.]

Tahira: We’re closing.

Nasir: Huh?

Tahira: انت مش عم تسمع؟ We’re done for today. [Flips the ""Open"" sign to ""Closed.""]

Nasir: It’s 3:15, we close at 7.

Tahira: كنت عم بحكي عالتلفون مع اختي، ما عندك فكرة شو عم بصير, ok? [To Sarah] I’m sorry, he can’t finish.

Nasir: I’m already done.

Tahira: !طب خلصني وأعطيها اياها بقى [Nasir hands over the watch in a box, and she gives it to Sarah.] You should go home. Something strange is happening in the city.

[Tahira guides a confused Sarah out of the store while locking the door and closing the blinds. Sarah flips off the store before leaving. Cut to Sarah ringing the doorbell at the Adlers' house. Connie answers, dressed in black with an esoteric necklace.]

Connie: [Melodiously] There you are, dear. I felt your energy approaching.

Sarah: [Excited] Sorry I’m late.

Connie: I was getting worried. The spirits are restless today.

Sarah: I was picking something up for my idiot dad.

Connie: Ah, I see.

[Sarah enters the house as the family dog, Mercy, comes to greet her. The dog seems nervous, almost scared.]

Sarah: Hey, Mercy. [Starts petting him. She turns to Connie.] Hey, is everything okay? Like, on the news?

Connie: [Mysteriously] What do you mean, dear?

Sarah: Well, there were a lot of cops and fire trucks on the street today. It felt like the end of the world.

Connie: [Whispering] And maybe it is, my young one. The signs are everywhere. [Walks to the kitchen] I was thinking of baking some cookies and having a little séance today.

Sarah: [Excited] Chocolate?

Connie: With raisins. Raisins are good for opening the third eye.

[Cut to the cookies baking in the oven. Sarah is doing her homework while Connie tries to feed Nana in the background. The elderly woman seems to be muttering incomprehensible words.]

Connie: Come on, Mama. It’s green. You love green. [The oven timer goes off.] Oh! There we go! [She sighs and gets up. To Sarah] I don’t know why I talk to her. She’s completely deaf... or maybe talking to the other side.

[Sarah looks around as Connie stops the timer and takes out the cookies. Sarah gets up and walks to a shelf with DVDs. She starts browsing through them.]

Connie: [Off-screen] Want to give me a hand?

Sarah: Coming!

[She continues looking through the DVDs as Nana starts trembling behind her. Sarah doesn’t notice and picks up a DVD, Curtis and Viper 2. But inside the DVD case, she finds a Nazi pamphlet hidden.]

Sarah: [To herself] Wow... this is perfect. [Goes to the kitchen.] Hey, Mrs. Adler? Can I borrow this?

Connie: [Puts on her glasses and takes the",1,1742415066.0,thelastofus,0,1.0,False
1jf6h48,https://i.redd.it/hzuc3bqaeppe1.jpeg,Feeling overwhelmed,"Thought I was breaking out more than a month ago because of eating too much sugar but it just won’t go away :( Finally figured out it’s fungal acne (at least I think?). It’s all over my chest and lymph nodes too. I really need to get it under control because I have appointments for tattoos on my chest/shoulders in the coming months.

I washed my face with head & shoulders 2 in 1 yesterday because that’s what I had. Today my face is really itchy and oily, even though it’s usually not. I usually pick at them because just running my nail over them pops them but I’m trying really hard to not touch my face. And I swapped the coffee I normally have for something sugar free. 

I bought equate medicated shampoo today (i think a generic version of selsun blue). I have differen gel but have never used it. My skin is usually really dry and I use vaseline as a moisturizer but I’ve seen that’s a no-no? But I’m scared to change too many things in my routine at once.

How do I navigate this? Wash with the dandruff shampoo daily until it’s under control, then start differen? Start differen now but only once a week? Help 😩",1,1742415001.0,Fungalacne,0,1.0,False

Ever since I was young, I've had issues with my bowel movements—my mom would always scold me for rarely pooping, saying it could lead to colon cancer in the future.

As a college student living in a boarding house, my lifestyle isn’t the healthiest. I rarely drink water, don’t eat on time, and barely eat veggies (unless I’m home on weekends, where I’m forced to eat them). Recently, I started tracking my bowel movements and realized that sometimes, I go a whole week without pooping without even noticing.

I heard that Yakult or Green tea helps with digestion, but I’m not sure how effective it is. Sometimes, I only get to poop after drinking coffee (lucky day) which I only drink when pulling an all-nighter. I really want to improve my habits, but I’d appreciate any advice—especially natural remedies or drinks that can help me poop (no meds, please!). Any tips?",1,1742414935.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

He is also employed in my business.
Since 2020 (lockdown) his drinking has increased. 
It was never a problem prior to this and he was never a “going out to clubs, pubs “ kind of a person . He isolates himself completely.
He reached the point - at New Year 25, of admitting to drinking a large bottle (70cl ) of vodka per day. Alone in his room .This led to an acute episode of vomiting blood ( coffee grounds) seizures x3 and each seizures led to him going into cardiac arrest.
He spent almost 2 weeks ventilated in ICU , went through DTs , withdrawal etc , but mercifully was mainly sedated. 
I thought this was his rock bottom 
He was told if he drinks again , he’ll either be dead - or wish he was. He was told that his pancreas was partly necrotic .
He recovered and was discharged home at the end of Jan.
Has attended AA since and begun to see an alcohol counsellor. 
Since then has now relapsed 3 times. 
Needed to go back to hospital with acute withdrawal , they gave him thiamine and chlordiazepoxide for withdrawal and sent him home.
Here we are now in the latest relapse. 
And the this is it this time promises , I’ll stop now , etc .
Refuses to entertain rehab.
I don’t know what to do , how to help him , how to manage the shattered hopes and disappointment and fears for him. 
Although I’ve nursed many addicts ( former psych nurse) . I have no idea how to manage this and the bewildering array of emotions which go along with it.
Is there any hope at all? He’s playing Russian roulette with each bottle. 
I’m so afraid I’m going to lose him .

Going on the honor system here but whoever has the best footage where I’m featured I’ll Venmo you some cash monies for finders fees (nothing crazy maybe enough for a coffee 🙂‍↔️

It’s my first time visiting Japan. Coming for 2.5 weeks in mid-May.

I am mid-30s travelling w/ my partner, from Canada.

My partner particularly loves outdoor experiences (hiking, etc.) which is why we included Kamikochi & Izu.

Open to recommendations & tips!

A few specific questions I have are:

\-          What time would you ideally arrive to the Grand Sumo tournament?

\-          Does anyone have recommendations for hikes, dinners, activities in the Izu area?

\-          Any recommendations for day hikes in Kamikochi?

\-          Days 5 through 7 are a lot of train time but I’m particularly excited for the ryokan & hiking so worth it to me. My backup option was Hakone – any thoughts on Hakone versus Takayama & Kamikochi?

\-          Is renting ebikes in Kyoto a good idea?

\-          Any other recommendations that people particularly enjoyed on their trips?

That day was ordinary, . I had just left my grandmother’s place , her voice still echoing in my mind, warning me of the rain to come. She handed me a large green umbrella — one of those old Safaricom ones, sturdy and wide like her love. I didn’t think much of it then, but fate had a way of folding little moments into memories that last a lifetime.

Under the bridge, I saw him — a stranger wrapped in rain and solitude. He smiled at my approach, and I, caught in the kindness of the moment, offered to share my shelter. The umbrella arched over us like a secret we both wanted to keep. Laughter mingled with the patter of rain, stories flowed easily, like we had known each other before — in another life, maybe.

He led me to his school  hostels , a simple place, . I refused to go inside stranger danger you know. , but he brought me coffee and we start at chair  outside .He said I reminded him about his teenage . He told me he loved maths like I did . The rain lightened, reluctantly giving us our goodbye. He walked me home, and in that moment, as the sky exhaled its final drops, he hugged me close, kissed me gently — my first kiss😩😭, wrapped in rain, laughter, and the scent of coffee.

And then — nothing. No phone number since I didn't have a phone so we couldn't communicate but I fantanzied about him the whole term  ..Kenhill wherever you are you are the reason I'm not a doctor

Hey, I’m Julia. I’m 44, divorced for six years, and a mom to two great kids (15 & 19). My life is in a good place—amicable relationship with my ex, no baggage, and I actually like where I’m at. But let’s be honest, something’s missing.

So why Reddit? Because dating apps are exhausting, and every guy who approaches me in real life is under 30. Flattering? Sure. What I want? Not so much. I’m busy, I have a life, and I’d rather just connect with someone without all the swiping and small talk.

Pictures of me in profile, by the way!

A Bit About Me:

🏡 Job: I work in interior design—mostly home staging and renovations. Basically, I make spaces look good and tell people what furniture to buy. It’s creative, flexible, and keeps me on my feet.

🎵 Hobbies: Traveling when I can, live music (yes, I will drag you to a concert), beach days, and hunting down the best iced coffee in town.

💪 Staying Active: I lift weights enough to stay in shape, go for long walks, and pretend dancing counts as cardio.

What I Like About Myself:

✅ I’m fun, social, and always up for an adventure.

✅ I take care of myself and feel better now than I did at 30.

✅ I genuinely enjoy life and don’t let the little things stress me out.

What I’m Looking For:
	•	Age? Ideally 42-55, but I’d consider 35+ if you’ve got your life together. Up to 60 if you’re in great shape and have that something about you.

	•	Height? Over 6’ is my type, but confidence is just as attractive.

	•	Body? Not a bodybuilder, but someone who looks like they care about themselves.

	•	Style? I love beards, long hair, and tattoos, but if you’re clean-cut and it works for you, great.

	•	Personality? Confident, fun, and masculine. Someone who knows who they are and doesn’t play games.

One More Thing…

Let’s be real—attraction matters. If we don’t find each other sexy, it won’t work. I’m not here for endless messaging or a pen pal situation. Chemistry, energy, and that little spark? That’s what makes something real.

If this sounds like you, send a message—and maybe skip the “hey” and make it interesting. Maybe list your favourite and least favourite part about yourself in your message to stand out.",2,1742414101.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False

I think I might have been catfished in the weirdest way possible, and I don’t even know what the end goal was.

So, I match with this girl on a dating app – let’s call her Sarah. She’s gorgeous, like properly stunning, but also has that kind of quirky energy, very quirky. Our chat is great, full of banter, good vibes, all that. We decide to meet up, and I suggest something simple – a coffee or maybe a pint. But no, Sarah wants something *different*. She says she’s always wanted to learn how to play the bodhrán (very specific, but alright). She asks if I can play. I tell her no, obviously. Next thing I know, she’s found a bodhrán instructor and has booked us both a lesson.

At this point, I’m kind of bewildered but also intrigued. It’s a weird first date, sure, but I like her, and maybe this is just one of those fun, spontaneous things you lean into. We text back and forth a bit over the next few days, and on the day of the lesson, she confirms it’s still happening. So I rock up to the place, and just as I’m about to go in, she texts saying she’s running a few minutes late but to go inside, and she’ll meet me there.

I go in, knock on the door, and a middle-aged man (the bodhrán instructor) greets me. He lets me in, sits me down, and we both just kind of… sit there, waiting for Sarah. It’s awkward. After about ten minutes, the instructor suggests we start without her, and I don’t know how to politely decline, so I just… do a bodhrán lesson. For an hour.

And Sarah *never* shows up.

I finish the lesson (because what else am I meant to do I got anxious idk?), leave, and try to get in contact with her. No response. Completely ghosted. Whatsapp is gone, number is blocked. At this point, I assume she’s either dead or this was some kind of mad prank. Either way, I try to move on, chalking it up as the weirdest dating app experience of my life.

Then, about a *week* later, I’m walking past the bodhrán place, and my curiosity gets the better of me. I figure I’ll pop in, ask the instructor if he ever heard from her – just to make sure she’s not in a ditch somewhere.

I open the door… and the instructor is in the middle of a lesson with another guy. 

I start apologising for interrupting, but then I just say feck it and ask the instructor about Sarah. I explain that she never showed up, I can’t get in contact, and I’m a bit worried. Before the instructor can even respond, the other guy turns to me, looking confused, and tells me that he's waiting on a ""Sarah"" she's booked this lesson and also hasn't shown up.

At this point, my brain fully short circuits.

So now, I’m standing there, staring at this guy, realising we were both *independently* lured into taking bodhrán lessons by the same girl, who has now disappeared off the face of the earth.

What the actual f\*ck happened here? My friends are telling me to forget about it (probably because it's the only thing I've talked about for a week straight) but I feel like if you actually EXPERIENCED this you would feel exactly how I feel and would not be able to rest until you've got some sort of answer.

Any theories? I'm almost afraid to ask if this has happened to anyone else. Please tell me I’m not losing my mind. (This was all in Cork btw)",54,1742413909.0,AskIreland,33,1.0,False

1jf5w46,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Key-Archer-2593/comments/1jf5w46/one_tall_ass_leprechaun_or_something/,One Tall Ass Leprechaun or Something,"Today I’m thinking of the small things.

Well… other than reflecting on how my last letter (and really all of them honestly) just entirely lined up with exactly how one of my kind reacts to a breakup, no matter how short… I think it might be worse when its short actually… That’s what I was talking to my therapist about last week anyway. That I only remember really feeling like this when I have left early. If they’re long… seems like I just go through that process within the relationship.. so once it’s over it’s been dead for much too long. Progress? Who knows anymore. Too many instances where I’ve been shown what I knew, but not as well as I understand now (yet still don’t fully get it huh?). I guess the upside of all this is, that I should be over it and processed through it more quickly… if only I can actually move in the right direction this time… I think I’m getting on to the right track… slowly.

But anyway… the small moments right? The things that I liked, rather than all the red flags yeah? Not really as what I want in the future (well.. cuz I’m trying to get out of this right?), not really things I miss about you (I don’t think?), but maybe more just… what are those things that made me look past all the red flags you were waving in my face? Something like that. Maybe reassurance to myself, or acknowledgement to myself, that there was something that made me stay other than just subconsciously wanting to recreate shitty versions of all sorts of relationships where it was proposed as being “love”.

I’ve already told you this… but that whine. I don’t think I’ve ever liked a whine. You did this, little whine, but almost trilling? That’s not the right word, but kinda.. it reminds me of my whiney ass cat.. demanding shit out of me. I say she yells but she doesn’t.. it’s soft and endearing (which makes me wonder how long you’ve practiced that to perfection?). The cat used to wake me up out of a dead ass sleep- hit that biological parent note that makes you jump out of bed immediately to attend to someone else. Yeah… that’s your whine, and as odd as it was… I loved it, rather unfortunately.

You like a splash of the (second) worst milk in the world in your coffee, “just enough to change the color”. Standing there looking at the blackest of black coffee (the way I love it… that 3 cups in 1 mug kind of black abyss)… I felt so unsure about how much to put in. It was so much more than I saw you do when you’d be making us coffee. I’m pretty sure it never changed color despite my heavy hand. You said you loved it, sitting on my bed- were you unsure of leaving my room? There was something in the way you looked at me then, as I handed you coffee. Like you haven’t had someone do before? But you have… I’ve handed you coffee… Whatever that look was, I felt.. close? I’m not sure. But today that memory decided to slap me in the face as I got out of bed this morning.

Almost like the look you gave me the one time I went and saw you when we were “friends”. Maybe it’s just you looking up at me, not too many times I’ve seen that angle of your face. I wanted to tell you, when you confessed later about how you were feeling that day, that I knew, because it was written all over your face. I wonder if you know that? That your emotions are written plainly for the whole world to see, no matter how much you try to hide it, or deny that you have them. Good, bad, “scribbled”… but you already knew I could read them just fine, you’ve seen me do it so many times.

And, though I told you about the way you mistook mine… I know you did it back to me. I, however, know that I’m incapable of hiding emotions. I’m a shit liar (at least to everyone else, turns out I’m damn good at convincing myself anyway). Though you noticed, and often responded in ways that showed me you acknowledged them, without me having to verbalize them. I don’t always like to, as you know. It’s not that I don’t think I have emotions, I’m very aware of that, but I’ve been working on recognizing when those are from the past rather than the present. I don’t know if you ever got that.. what I was saying. Somehow, somewhere along the way it seems we got different messages on handling those. I bet in between our approaches, there’s middle ground there that we both could really benefit from. But anyway.. yeah, I liked not really how you read me, but rather, that you tried to. I don’t think I’ve had that often (obviously…. Considering the cycle I get in yeah?... why this was just slightly different..).

Remember how I said there were times (like the last time) where a large chunk of me kind of dreaded seeing you? It’s a weird feeling… probably just that subconscious screaming of what I was in.. but anyway, every time I saw you it’d go away in an instant. You’d do this overexaggerated (or maybe real, but it’s so much it seems, oddly off?) jump and skip of joy. Like that double heel click jump that a leprechaun does, not literally, but I can’t think of how else to describe it. Little blip of pure joy, like getting a bowl of only the lucky charm marshmallows as a kid.

You know, my older brother used to eat all the oats first. Me and the younger would stare at him like he was crazy, but were always so jealous to see him eat nothing but spoon after spoon of marshmallows at the end. I was too busy draining every ounce of milk out of mine to sort through them, and the younger was always picking every marshmallow out first. That little leprechaun kick of yours makes me want to think you’d eat those oats first as a kid… but I think you might just be the target audience for the “all marshmallow” release.

Getting sidetracked here, but you know that too. That was probably the biggest one really. Seems like those kind of people are the only people I can tolerate even these days. Or ever? I’m not sure, but I see it now much more clearly now that I know. Your hands make me laugh, that reminder. Just right fucking there. Did I tell you that’s what the one on my finger was too? I can’t remember. But since all the rest seemed so depressing (including the one you adored), it was my reminder to stop being so serious. To take things more lightly… that’s why the other on that side is from a gumball machine too. Why I demanded the placement to be “off” despite the artist trying to correct me. It was meant for me not others. A reminder that I’m still not heeding.

Even as I type this, it is difficult to not be so critical of myself huh? Or the world. Or my place in it. My interactions with it. You once called me “eccentric”, I didn’t understand what you meant. You told me it’s because of how I “make things work for me”, that I make situations that are not particularly of interest work for me but in an odd way. I’d never been described that way. I guess you’re right. I just kind of figured that’s what everyone did? One of those big blind spots I guess, perhaps that’s what I kind of saw in you, not that you approached things in that way, but that you noticed it? Maybe it’s just something I wish I was doing in a more positive way. Maybe I just liked the way you imposed your idea of me onto me. That person seemed to be less complicated and burdened. I think maybe the second definition of “eccentric” is much more apt really.

Joyous huh… small good things…

Your confusion of my nose boops. It’s not the first time I have left someone so confused with those. I can’t help it honestly. I love those nose boops. No matter how many times I did it, you just seemed dumbfounded but in awe of my silliness. Or maybe it just was odd enough to not be seen as an incoming attack over the walls you have around you. Kind of like the way I’d search for and hold your hand in those moments, not the ones you’d run from, but the other times. Though you saw those eventually as too much, didn’t you?

The way you smelled. But you knew that too. Part of me is so glad I returned and didn’t ask for a new shirt that last time. Part of me is pissed that I did. I have this theory, that once I don’t like someone, or I recognize the way they’re terrible for me, that their scent is no longer good. The really awful more recent one, started smelling of peroxide for the last couple years we were together. Back then I think I started thinking I was smelling him being sick, but I guess I will have to stop returning future people’s shirts. Start ziplock bagging and storing them in the closet… learn how to make an excel spreadsheet. I’m not too into that kind of science… but it’s important question really. Questions that would really change the state of the world to be answered, see?

Shared music. Definitely. Though as I look back now, I wonder how much that is what you said rather than what it was. Pretty pleased I don’t feel burdened to go to the last shows you mentioned wanting to see this summer. Still fucking bummed I (we?) missed AJJ.

I liked your vocabulary. Even if sometimes I was left quite confused. I think I spent too much time in the last place I lived… where the vocabulary was so limited that I didn’t make sense to anyone in my normal speech. I stopped running into people that understood. I stopped running into people with larger and more diverse vocabulary than my own. It was nice. I wonder if you leave many people confused, well, in just your vocabulary alone- I know the rest of you does regularly.

I think it’s pretty obvious here that I’m not really able to be all that elated looking back at these small things. It’s a mix really. Grey. Dialectical? Speaking of… I’m not as familiar as you are, obviously with that… but pretty fucking sure you’re supposed to finish the whole damn statement in that practice. Not just drop half of it over there, and then later the other half over here. Just back and forth, up and down, sideways and fucking crashing? You would have made so much more sense to me if you had just said the whole bit? You know?

Am I wrong here? Perhaps… but I think that’s one of those things, I appreciate that you can see the discrepancy, or see both sides… AND yet, you’re still hung up on not being able to verbalize that fully, AND I guess in a way you told me that, AND I guess I could’ve done a better job at recognizing that, figuring that out more during the time, AND it likely wouldn’t have mattered anyway, AND that’s part of the whole reason things are the way they are, AND yet, it still bums me out, AND it’s really less about you AND more about myself, where I need to work on things AND recognizing that I’m getting there, AND as cringey as it is to fully put out what it is that I’m going through as I recognize it, it’s needed, AND I wish it wasn’t AND it was easier being oblivious in some ways AND I’m still going to work on that, because somewhere I think I may find a better, more stable, more fulfilling spot in the future if I do AND, that’s what I really want.

So when you told me, “you said this isn’t what you wanted”, you were right, AND you were wrong on what it was I was referring to, AND perhaps, one day, you’ll know what I meant, AND I hope you recognize that similarity we have, that discrepancy, AND find it somewhere else, because yes, this hurts, AND it’s not the reason you may think it does, AND that’s honestly, okay, I don’t need you to understand, AND yet I still wish you did for your own sake.

I don’t know, fucking something like that. Eat your oats AND enjoy your marshmallows.. in the second shittiest type of milk in the world.. or something. I’m gonna go make my “2^(nd)” (6^(th)?) cup of coffee meow, black as the blackest abyss, uncorrupted… Did you ever hear that study that says you’re more likely to be a psychopath if you take your coffee black?

I was made to stay overnight in the airport for the next available flight. 

My purchased Comfort Plus seat was downgraded with this new flight to a pitiful economy seat with limited legroom for my 6ft frame. The free in-flight drinks were ripped from my grasp. I was frigid from the cold of sleeping in the airport. I did what I felt a person does in the face of injustice. I took the seat I felt owed. The FA asked for my beverage of choice, and I requested a coffee with 2 shots of vodka. All felt right. 

Until a man approached my seat with the words, ""Wait, this isn't right."" He turned around, I presume to call a FA, but I stopped him. I told him that he was right. I was not assigned to this seat. I stood up to walk away, leaving my travel bag in the compartment above. I cramped my legs into the dilapidated economy seat in withered apathy. Over the speaker, i hear a FA announce, ""Attention, this is a full flight. Please sit in your assigned seats."" Delta beat me into submission. I locked in my neck pillow, put on my noise canceling headphones, a sleep mask, and fell asleep. I knew she was speaking directly to me.

A little background - we have had a christening booked for several months, our baby is a rainbow baby after a miscarriage the year before and she is our first baby. My family is in another country, godparents also and had to fly over for the christening. My husband has a somewhat distant relationship with his Mum and Sister but very close with his Dad.

Here goes, apologies it’s a long post

We had a message from my SIL a few days before the christening saying she didn’t think she could make it, my husband said no worries and that he hopes everything is ok

A day later she responded saying we’re taking it day by day and it’s really difficult so obviously we’re worried and think something serious must be going on, my FIL called that evening and we asked if everyone was ok, he said he wasn’t aware of anything

The next morning at 7am we get a phone call from my FIL, we are all in bed as is our daughter, we have a busy day ahead as my parents and the godparents are arriving- he is at the bottom of our apartment block and is asking if he can come up (any other time I would have said no but I assume it’s to do with the message from SIL.

FIL precedes to tell us the SIL’s daughter who is in her early twenties is being treated for lymphoma, my husband and I are both shocked and worried for our niece.

FIL then goes on to explain that her blood tests are clear, and she has a having a biopsy done on the swollen lymph node she noticed,  but as she’s had Epstein Barr virus and lost lots of weight in the last 4 years she’s ticking boxes for lymphoma and they’re all devastated and it’s been a really difficult time

My FIL said he was sorry he had to tell us on the day my family was arriving - they’d known for two weeks, biopsy was this a few days away and results within two weeks after that

Obviously I am concerned and so is my husband but  it’s not confirmed yet and we will hope for the best that the biopsy comes back as normal.

So onto the christening, SIL has not said she would come, nor do we expect her to, FIL has explained she has been in tears for two weeks and is beside herself. Our niece shows up and is in great spirits which is lovely to see.

SIL shows up late, no problem but a text to say she was coming would have been nice, christening goes on and we all have a coffee after, SIL keeps disappearing to the table next to us to cry in view of everyone (my family who have flown over are not aware what’s going on as we were asked to not say anything).

FIL takes it upon himself to tell my BIL and his wife at the christening what’s going on, understandably the mood is strange and somber, and my family is confused. 

My SIL came up to me while I was getting baby out of the pram, and I said do you want to have a cuddle, instead of sitting with us and having a chat she took baby down the other end of the table out of my view and sat for 45 mins with baby, I felt I couldn’t say anything because I know how upset she’s been and I’d look like an asshole but the whole christening was probably only an hour and a bit, me and my husband barely got a look in, none of my family or my BILs Family got to hold baby. MIL, FIL, SIL and niece all sat down the other end for the whole christening and barely said two words to us, the only time MIL came to speak to us she stood by the middle of the table and started crying in front of everyone- you know with everything going on

Anyway it wasn’t the most comfortable of events and most people seemed miserable, we feel the christening was ruined but can’t say anything 

AITA for being annoyed they ruined the christening for me, my husband and my family who flew over, I just feel like they knew for two weeks before so could have told us anytime before and also could have waited till the biopsy results as nothing is confirmed at the moment and it does feel like they are all jumping on this and planning a funeral, I don’t feel it was appropriate to tell other family members at the christening either

I have little tolerance for my SIL who has a flair for drama - she also kicked her daughter out a few years ago, didn’t show up to her birthday in the last few months and our niece showed us the texts her own mother sent her calling her a manipulative little b etc. just pure nasty messages 

We have spoken to our niece privately and told her we’re here for her if she needs anything and that we’re really sorry she has to go through this

FIL is also now annoyed at my husband because he has not called SIL about this - Husband and SIL don’t have a relationship really, he text her offering to call before the christening and the day after in case she wanted to talk and she never replied 

Hopefully the Biopsy comes back all clear but honestly just feel the day and family dynamics are a bit of a shit show and I don’t want our baby around that",3,1742411982.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

1jf566d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jf566d/the_forest_took_me_to_a_place_that_doesnt_exist/,The forest took me to a place that doesn't exist,"I thought about killing myself all the time. Intrusive thoughts, like jumping off buildings, bridges, throwing myself in front of cars, or throwing myself towards the rocks in the ocean. Something inside me was eating me up from the inside, and I assure you, it was bigger than any ghost anyone has ever written about on this site. I spent a few nights using some substances and hooking up with any guy I met at the club. My psychologist said that this was a desire to indirectly kill myself. My friends recommended that I look for hobbies to keep me busy, like going to the gym, doing morning runs, swimming or pilates. None of these options appealed to me. On a random Thursday, February 20th, at seven in the morning, I took my parents' car and drove along the main road. There was a small town next to mine, it was an old indigenous reservoir. I didn't tell anyone, because I was afraid they would judge me as a young ritualist. But I was going there because I had heard about a ritual that reconnected you with your innermost self and promised to make you come to terms with your past, and there was a lot of it that you wanted to forget. I drove along the road, and it was swallowed up by the trees, always trusting Google Maps. I parked at a gas station diner to fill up and eat something.



It was when I turned left, towards a dirt road, almost closed, that I felt that things were starting to get strange. The GPS was constantly updating the routes, making me go deeper and deeper into the forest. I used to like this silence. I didn't even turn on the radio. It was just the wind blowing through some leaves and the wheels of my parents' old truck getting dirty with dirt. At some point I came across a deer among the trees. It watched me, and I did the same, slowing down. I loved deer, and that made me instantly happy. I took out my cell phone and took a few pictures before it turned its tail toward me and headed into the forest.

I continued on my way for about another hour, but when it got to two in the afternoon and I hadn't gotten anywhere, I started to worry. Between twists and turns, it felt like I was entering a stomach, a small red pickup truck with a stupid and depressed girl being swallowed by the pine trees. My terror grew.

The car stopped with a full tank of gas.

The cell phone turned off with 40% of its battery still left.

A noise, a moaning of some animal in the middle of the forest.

I was in the middle of a road. Lost. Apparently the place I was looking for to make me believe in life again was the place I was going to die. I thought. Because I have funny thoughts when I'm nervous. I was in shock, trying to start the car and my cell phone, cursing the gods, which was a terrible idea since hours later I would pray to all of them. There was no way I could walk all the way, after spending an hour in the car, and even more so without a GPS.



I settled into the car, left all the doors locked and hoped that another car would pass by, perhaps another depressed person looking for a cure, who could help me get out of there alive.



I fell asleep.



And I woke up. It wasn't night, it wasn't day. I wasn't even in my car seat. I looked around me, I was in a room, like a parking lot, there was only a small light in the center, there was nothing in that place, and I mean literally, just four bare walls surrounding me, no doors, no hidden exits, or anything on the floor, just a light that illuminated the empty field. How had I gotten there?



I was in despair. As if just being there made me feel claustrophobic, I started to lose my breath, to feel hungry, to feel thirsty, as if something inside me was suffocating me, as if there was a cork in my throat. I tried to scream. But to whom? To where? I banged on the walls and made no sound. My own voice wouldn't come out. How could I have slept in my locked car and woken up in a place where there is no entrance or exit? How could I not even remember how I got here?



At some point the feeling of hunger and shortness of breath passed. I think it was just an anxiety attack.



But I still felt desperate and wanted to cry. However, I had entered survival mode.



I started looking for something, this time more carefully so I could get out of there. I stayed for what seemed like hours, days, my sanity practically disappearing. So I decided that instead of dying a slow death from hunger, I decided to die quickly. I hit my head against the wall once, and twice, and three times, until I fell to the ground, still awake, still breathing, but so tired that I passed out.



I woke up in the forest. Thank God. I screamed, and smiled, and cried. I kissed the ground beneath me. My head still hurt, and there was dried blood on my forehead, which made me understand that this was real. The sun was still out, I was happy, I was lost among the trees, I still had no idea how I was being transported to places I was in different, but at least now I had a chance to go back home. I had a chance to get out of there. I could see the sky, I could breathe the air.



So I started running, and I know that many people in the US disappear in the woods or are killed by bears, but I didn't think about the statistics, I just ran, looking for any trace of human life. And by some miracle, or a lot of prayer, I found it, the red truck was there, shining in the light of the end of the day, my eyes couldn't hold back the tears, when I got to it, I noticed through the window that my cell phone was also on by the lights of my mother's call notifications. But as soon as I tried to open the door, nothing. It was locked. Just like I remember leaving it before falling asleep. How could that be?



I didn't have time to think, I just looked for the biggest rock I could find there, punched the passenger window, squeezed through the shards and jumped into the driver's seat, my cell phone on, the key when I turned it, the engine started, it was the best noise I've ever heard in my life, and when I started the car, the old radio started playing some Beatles, and I started laughing, uncontrollably, I didn't know what had happened, but I was extremely happy, the important thing was that I was alive.

But I couldn't even turn the car when the same deer appeared between the trees, strong and helpless, its black and huge eyes stared at me, and now, it didn't seem beautiful anymore. It didn't even look like an animal, its eyes had the anger of a human, or something else. So I finished the turn and accelerated towards the way back, at that moment, the deer also came out from between the trees, and started running.

I'm going to survive, you piece of shit. I couldn't stand all this for nothing anymore.

I accelerated even more.

Until I lost sight of him.



So I started to take it easy on myself, my head was still burning, and night was falling.



I checked the GPS, the route was sending me back home.



Everything was perfect. It was showing 40 minutes to get off the dirt road.



And once again that place was playing with me, because my car stopped again. And I was ready to freak out again. When several footsteps approached my car, flashlights shining on my dirty and bloody face, there were eleven men, all of them, white and tall, dressed in uniform and with guns on their waists. I sighed in relief, maybe they were guards, that's what I thought before one of them shouted for me to get out of the car immediately. As a woman, I started to think the worst, we are taught to do so.



""Get out now, or we will shoot"" Said one of the tallest ones, kicking the front of the car.



""Please, I got lost, but the authorities are already on their way, they have my location, they will be here soon"" I lied, as I got out of the car.



They whispered among themselves. But the bigger guy, without showing any reaction, continued.

""The authorities don't go up this mountain, nor the locals, nor should you.""

""Why?""

""031. Take the girl, don't scare her."" He said, referring to one of the guys who was right behind me, and grabbed my arm, but without using much force.

""Cooperate with us, and you'll get home safely."" The guy said in my ear, while putting a blindfold on my eyes.

""Please, don't do anything to me, I'm too scared."" I begged and asked for things like that, while they pushed me into the forest. I tried to escape and run a few times, but the gun on their waist reminded me that I wouldn't get that far. My tears were running, and I felt like I was almost fainting from hunger, thirst, pain, when I felt with my feet that the ground changed, it wasn't uneven like in the forest, it was smooth. The cold and windy weather stopped, it became warm, and behind me, I heard a door slam.

I spent a few minutes screaming for someone to tell me what was happening. I heard some whispers, but most of them were in codes and numbers, some of them said something about ""Empty Spaces"", which I unfortunately had been there, I spoke regretfully, while the car reprimanded and told him to never talk about ""worms"" around me again. Some time passed, I was standing, with my legs threatening to give way, when someone pushed me again, another door closed behind me, and I sat down on what looked like a chair.

Someone removed the blindfold from me. And I realized that I was in a room, this one with a dark window, lights and a door, in front of me a table with water and a natural sandwich, and on the other side, which surprised me, was a woman.

""You can help yourself"" She said, and I swallowed everything in a matter of minutes, while she watched me. The woman wore the same black uniform as the others, and her face was free, she had brown hair and greenish eyes, and she looked to be between 40 and 50 years old.

""Girl, unfortunately, do you know why you're here?""

""No,"" I replied.

""You entered an area that is restricted to the United States Army, no citizen can pass through that road, didn't you see the signs or the fence?""

""No,"" I replied again, trying to remember something, but there was nothing this type, just an open road ""I'm sorry, I didn't know. Will I have to pay anything or be arrested?""

The woman just writes something down

""Stay calm, I just need you to tell me everything you remember about your time here""

And so I told her everything, why I was going there, the indigenous village I wanted to see, still a little scared, of being executed in secret and no one ever knowing my whereabouts again, but I told her, and after telling her about the room I stayed in for a few hours or days, it seemed, I added ""Was that from the government?""

""No"" she replied.

""Then what was it from?""

She ignored me.

""You'll get an IV here, and we'll discharge you as soon as you feel better, you've been through a lot today, we want to make sure you're okay, and you'll be released""

I was taken to a room, this time a kind man attended to me, he looked like a nurse, he put the IV in my arm and I fell asleep.

I woke up.

A loud noise was making my head hurt, the smell of fried eggs and bacon. I was sleeping at the counter of the diner, it was full of people there, it was already morning, one of the waitresses called my name.

""Finally woke up, huh? You must have had quite a trip."" And she handed me a plate of avocado and a black coffee.

I ate that, drank the coffee, felt my cell phone in my pocket. There was no call from my mother, or photo of the deer, and its battery was fully charged. In the other pocket, the keys to the car. After paying the waitress, I went to the parking lot and it was in perfect condition, without a single scratch, the wheels were clean and the window intact. Everything seemed like a dream, except for the scar on my head and the small mark from where they had put the serum. I checked my cell phone again, and the date was February 24th, a Monday. I spent the whole weekend in that place. I thought about going to the local police and reporting everything. But I was so tired that I just went back home.



I looked into some kind of army reservation there, and there was nothing registered.



I went on the indigenous reservation's Instagram, and the account was simply deleted.



I didn't tell anyone. Only a nerdy friend I know, who told me to report all of this here, I didn't even know about this social network, I'm an Instagram girl, but I've been reading about ""Backrooms"", ""SeteAlem"" and ""hidden bunkers"", and I don't know if any of the stories on this site are real, but I'm desperate, because I'm afraid of being watched, and I don't know who to help.



I'm writing this on March 19, almost a month after the events. My nerdy friend and I went to a concert by one of our friend's rock bands, near Oregon, where the road passes, and then he decided to stop by without telling me. We passed by the same road, but where the gas station with the diner should have been, there was nothing else there, and where the dirt road should have turned, there were nothing but trees. I was outraged and stressed, I made him park in the spot, he started laughing saying that I made it all up, or that I hit my head really hard. We started walking on the side of the road, that's when we noticed the big trees placed there, dozens of trees and thorny plants covering the dirt road.

""I told you so,"" I said.

""Man, they really are trying to hide something.""

We didn't look for anything. We went back on the road towards the concert. I'm writing all this on my friend's account, I'm afraid they're still watching me, I'm afraid of falling asleep and waking up in that room, I'm afraid that deer is still chasing me, and worst of all, that one day he'll find me. If you live near Oregon, you might know which road I'm warning you about, if you've had an experience like this, please contact me, either in the comments or here. I just need to know if you've been there too, and how to get rid of this sick feeling.

As I've grown up, I find myself throwing away leftovers I didn't finish that went bad, or leftovers/gifted food that was forced upon me that isn't nutritious or particularly good.

I have an elderly neighbor who likes to have me over 1x a week for dinner but it's usually takeout items (fries, fried foods, bagged salads in takeout containers, greasy sandwiches) from a certain restaurant or food her neighbor prepared for her that I find really unappetizing. She insists I take it all back home with me, including toppings, condiments, even her portion, etc. I've tried to explain to her I'm just not going to eat it/the fridge is full/ I don't want it/my doctor said my cholesterol is high, but she basically forces it on me because she doesn't want it, either. I've asked if we could just have coffee, but she insists on a full meal; most times I'm the one eating in the room.

I've grown tired of saying ""no"" because it's met with even more insisting and more food and she, like many of her age group, has linked food to being a personal gift that represents her hospitality. Latey, I toss it out when I get home because I'll never eat it; I am pretty strict on what I consume and just 1 day a week of heavy takeout food is already too much. The days of me eating everything and anything are long gone. 

Is my wasting of this type of food really a sin in the eyes of the church? My father used to throw away junk food in the house us kids would sneak in and say it has no value, and thus not a sin.

My gastritis has gotten worse the last days and weeks, I went to my doctor last week and she just basically told me to sit and wait until I get an appointment for an gastroscopy.

The problem is, I am broke and my insurance doesn't pay much, so it takes me months to get an appointment, I probably have to wait 3-4 months to do my first gastroscopy.

I am struggling with gastritis for over a year now, I tried PPI's for 2 weeks, but they just resulted in more bloating and made my symptomes worse. I never touched them since.

I tried to eat in regular intervals but it didn't help me either, maybe I was using the wrong foods.

I stopped consuming alcohol, coffee and sweets, entirely, still my stormach is pissed, neither do I take any meds. I ended up deciding to start fasting since monday this week.

It was suggested for severe gastritis that a 2-3 day fast could help with the symptomes, wasn't from my Doctor I read it Online though.

The first 1-2 days, I noticed not really a change, today though my bloating is gone, my stormach feels warm though and my cough it feels like its getting less. Should I continue my fast? Plan was to do at least 3 days, maybe until Friday and then start eating slowly again. I am pretty hungry interestingly now, the first 2 days I wasn't at all, due to the gastritis.

Last time I did a fast, it was actually the opposite, the first 1-2 days as usual and then the hunger basically went away.

Any sugestions from you guys?

First of all, I would like to thank BB and 'gmatclub' for providing such an outstanding forum. Search few words of the questions and you get explanations from best instructors in the world. This is such an underestimated feature

Also, I would like to thank GMATNina, Marty Murrey, Daagh sir, Buenel and other instructors who are active on gmatclub, and on this forum. Being a non native speaker, it was really helpful to read explanations for verbal questions.

I gave GMAT in test centre as I have seen many online high GMAT scores were getting cancelled.

**Preparation:**

1. 2024

I started studying for GMAT last year in April 2024. I studied for 4-6 weeks and gave an OG mock. I scored 695, so I was bit confident. Then I gave GMAT after a week and scored 655. Since, Im from over represented demographic, I wanted 685-695+ So I appeared couple times again for GMAT after 2 weeks. Again, I scored 655. Something happened in my personal life, which took away all my motivation then.

However, I noticed that there are few problems with these attempts. SInce I was working, I couldnt get full uninterrupted 3-4 hrs to study daily. Also, I had no exam stamina, and by third section, my accuracy would start to drop slightly. Also, back then my Quant was good, but I would fall for trap very easily. I also couldnt get enough practice for DI. Verbal RC was very topic dependent. i would get like 90-95% in topics of science, tech, business, economics, etc and would get like 50% in history, culture, social based topics. CR was good.

I also noticed that the question on actual test were bit tougher than the ones in OG. Especially few DI questions were very very tough. Also in one attempt, I didnt get good 6-8 hrs of sleep. To overcome this, I drank coffee before exam, and boy oh boy, what a bad decision. As soon as I put my headsets on, I could hear my heart racing.

I often felt burnt out as well after working and studying too much. Also, I used to schedule exam on Monday, just to get more time off (Sat+Sun+Mon)

2. 2025

I resigned from my job in mid of Dec 2024. Travelled a bit for the rest of the month; came back and started preparing. I used TOP (India based prep company) and E-GMAT for my preparation. Since I dont prefer early mornings, I knew my exam slot has to be somewhere around 1pm. So, I developed a routine around that time. I would wake up, go to gym, come back and eat a bit, and then start studying at around 12.30-1pm. I would study 2-3 hours straight. Then I would take a break of 1-2 hours, play table tennis, watch some random youtube vids, etc.

There were few days, when I felt so so lazy :D. First time when I missed a day, it was tough to get back on track on the next. So I decided to not take 2 chill days back to back, and I would study at least 1 hour even on bad days.

This time, because I had whole day, my learning curve was very sharp, and I could feel better progress, especially in Verbal. I wanted to score 695/705+. For this score, you need on average 85 in each section. Scoring in Quant was slightly easier than DI and Verbal. However, after 6-7 weeks, I was more confident in Verbal. In mocks, I would get consistent 85-86, where as in Quant couple of incorrect question would drag Q to 84ish. DI was Ok Ok at 82. Scoring, I felt, in DI was bit tougher. 85 score in DI is almost 98-99%ile.

I was also not happy with DI portion of TOP, so I purchased monthly subscription of e-gmat to practice. I think this is what helped me further. e-gmat questions were full of traps, and it helped me stay alert and not commit and stupid mistakes.

**Mocks:**

I gave #1 OG mock in second half of Feb and scored 745. I was happy, but I gave this OG mock #1 last year, so there might be some sub conscious carry over of info. Regardless, 745 was decent.

Gave EGMAT mock1. Score 685 or 695 something.

After that, I appeared for mock 3 and scored 655. I realised that my time management is shit if I get stuck on one question (especially in Quant since I wanted  87-88+). Also I needed to completely remove silly mistakes if possible

I worked little bit on time management using sectional tests or random practice. I, then wrote mock #4 and scored 745. This score definitely boosted my confidence.

Just a day before exam I reset my OG mock #3 and tried it again. Many tutors dont recommend writing mock before a day or two. Anyways, I scored 695 in this one. However, I felt that the questions in this mock after resetting it once were tough, especially DI and Quant.

**Section Order :**

I realised that GMAT is very unforgiving for quant. I saw few reports where they missed one or two questions and that tanked theor score to <84. So this time, I was practicing with

Quant >> DI>> Break >> Verbal

Reasoning was, quant would give me good momentum, and DI is natural progression towards Verbal. Since I could probably solve two sections without break, I took it after DI. Also this time, I had better test stamina.

**Testing Experience :**

I was slightly sick and had back pain in first week of March, so I kinda pushed it to next week. Even on exam day, I didnt break my routine. Slept slightly early the day before and had good 8 hrs of sleep. I went to gym, did light cardio and light weight training. Ate complex carbs ( I read somewhere that it gives sustained energy to brain), protein shake and eggs. Pearson's test centre provided amazing experience. Target was 715+ since it was a good day.

First question appeared, which was easy. But I received few tough questions in first 5. As I started progressing towards question 12-13 difficulty was medium again, and by end it was again very tough. There was one long word problem on which I spent like 3-4 mins. I quickly guessed an answer and came back to it at the end. I was left with 7-8 minutes, so I solved it again from start and got the answer.

In the break of 1 min, I took deep breathes to calm nerves down, and then started with DI.

DI was tough from question 1. I received very early MSR around Q3-Q4 which had lots of data, but by end of this MSR I was keeping up with my pace. Couple of easy questions later, again got tough questions. I guessed one TPA (verbal) in the middle when I was slightly out of time. by question 13-14 I received another big fat MSR. This second MSR kind of messed up with my timings. Graph questions werent very tough, and I didnt get any curveballs. Table analysis was calculation heavy (weights related question) but doable. Couple of DS questions were easy, rest were 705+ level. I was slightly skeptical of very high sore by end of this section. I barely finished my DI section in the last 10 seconds.

Took break, ate a banana, drank some water, and remembered in my previous attempt, I  took like 7-8 mins completely to chill, and when I cam back, the security and checking procedure took additional time and I missed few mins of actual exam. So this time I was done within 5 mins.

Verbal: Got started with 2 medium level CR questions, followed by long RC. Surprisingly, I received two conditional reasoning questions after RC. From this point, I received tough questions in CR. Questions were very lengthy as well. Surprisingly, first time in my GMAT journey, I finished Verbal 3 mins early. haha. I then moved to one marked question, and changed it from incorrect to correct.

I was expecting score around 705-715 since I received very tough questions. However, I was still skeptical thinking I would have made mistakes.

Then boom - score flashed - 755 - Jumped with joy.

**Study Resources:**

GmatNinja videos are amazing and completely free on youtube. These are like free gold.

I enrolled in TOP  online. I think TOP has great question bank to practice. However,  I think this isnt for someone who is not very good with quant. Also, explanation for some questions were.. umm. questionable. Verbal was very good, barring few exceptions. However you get expert feedback very fast, and also, you can search few questions on gmatclub to get convincing solutions from Marty or GMATNinja

I also enrolled in monthly subscription of e-gmat to practice DI more. E-gmat's quant is tougher than OG. It might help you in building concepts, but I dont think GMAT tests the same thing. Still it is amazing for those who is making silly mistakes, because most of e-gmat questions has some kind of trap. Verbal, I think was not representative of actual OG. Although, their questions are not as great as OG question, you can still build concepts. I also think people usually underestimate the power of structured learning provided by prep companies like ttp and e-gmat.

I will start my research with admissions consultants soon.

Every time a stranger is nice to me or a barista gives me free drinks and food or I don’t have to pay for a ticket etc. my boyfriend comments about how it’s bc of my face. I think it’s just my aura/personality, I’m smiley and polite and I don’t see why that would be overlooked. 

Like for example, I was waiting for a limited edition item for my BF to drop for months, and the wait for this was crazy. I went into the store and line was entirely for this drop, the worker told me they don’t have it in stock but then he said he knows when the next shipment is coming in and he shouldn’t do it but he will put one aside for me. I then picked it up a few weeks later and he also gave me his discount, I told my bf and he chalked it down to “wow must be nice all those people in the line didn’t get the same treatment” and I was like yeah it’s because i’m NICE and he felt bad for me, and he said “no he wouldn’t do that if you were ugly or a male”.

This kinda comment is used often, recently I ordered coffee and the driver gifted me free dessert food from another store - it’s one of my favorites so I was so shocked and happy! I told my bf and he said the same thing. It happens very often, once a stranger at the station overheard me on the phone saying my apple pay isn’t working so I can’t get an uber and he asked me if I need cash, I didn’t even speak with him before he was just a kind person! When I study at a coffee shop the manager always pays for my food - idk why! We had a little chat years ago and since that day he rushes to tap his phone on the card reader before I can. Again, instead of saying wow he must think you’re hard working and nice, he says it’s because you’re pretty.

I don’t know if it’s petty for a red flag that he keeps doing this. I want to say something but Idk if he’s wrong for thinking this way

*   **Material and Durability:** Stainless steel kettle interiors are ‍preferred‌ for their durability, resistance to rust, and ease of cleaning. Make ⁣sure the kettle is⁣ BPA-free to ensure safe water consumption. For outdoor use, look for a ‍rugged‌ design that can withstand bumps and drops.

*  ⁤ **Boiling‍ Speed:** Time is precious, especially when‌ you're on the go. A fast boiling kettle can significantly improve your experience.Some kettles boast rapid boil technology, heating water in just​ a few minutes.

*   **Safety Features:** Safety is always paramount. Look for features like auto shut-off, which automatically turns off the kettle when the water boils or when it's empty, as well as dry boil⁤ protection, which prevents the element from overheating if there's no water in the kettle.

*   **Temperature Control:** Some advanced models offer temperature control, allowing you ​to select the ideal temperature for different types⁢ of tea or‌ coffee. This feature ‍is particularly ⁣beneficial⁤ for connoisseurs who appreciate precise brewing.

*   **Portability and Weight:** Especially for travel and outdoor activities, a lightweight and compact design is essential. Look for kettles that‍ can be easily packed in a backpack or suitcase.

I only recently realized that I might have ADHD after someone closed to me thought I ""knew"" I had ADHD for 10+ years. After a couple weeks of delay (I honestly forgot at the beginning - now that I think about it, I remember looking up ADHD symptoms back in the early 2000s but I just.. forgot to go to a doctor about it?), I finally managed to get on a phone call with a doctor from a clinic to discuss about it.

Unfortunately it's like... Because I did well in school (Thanks to Asian parents basically beating my ass), my doctor doesn't think I have ADHD. Also I had previous diagnosis for anxiety and depression, but I am pretty sure I had good reason for that - my ex absolutely destroyed me emotionally at the time.

I mean, I might not have ADHD? ... But everything I've read about it suggest that I do. I saw a lot of posts here, especially ones from a couple years ago, that says ""If you know you know"" or ""trust yourself"" - when I looked into ADHD (And I've been studying up on it for weeks now) everything felt like puzzle pieces that snap together, or like a bunch of lego bricks forming a seamless wall.

But if my doctor said that I don't, then how do I ""Trust myself""? I feel really dejected about the diagnosis. I have trouble expressing myself properly (I am chronically tired; turns out I drink a lot of coffee to get a cognitive spike, but they also make me super sleepy?) and I felt like I haven't advocate for myself properly. 

Uh, this isn't about medical side of things. I know what I \*should\* be doing on that end - trying more to advocate myself, get a second opinion, etc., I just feel really... dejected and defeated I guess. I don't really feel like I have the energy to push for it. Is this common...?

Hydration can be a goal, helps me focus and function better (water).
Protein intake, try to get my 2 scoops protein a day.
Self-soothing herbal teas
Healthy snacks like homemade popcorn or protein chips
Soon enough subscribe to a gym in riyadh and see how it goes, maybe i can do it in the early morning and be it habit before work? Maybe at night? Or both?
Spending time in nature, with some music, 
I wanted to add reading but i am not much interested lately, but maybe i can give it a go.

Say athkar morning and night too, start my day with also upbeat music and affirmations by chat gpt xd

Overall, maybe drinking enough water, some herbal teas, protien shake, some meals or make soups every now and then or boiled eggs and salad, walk or hit gym, and do my best at work is enough. Also self affirmations and journaling maybe.

That is for post ramadan

As for ramadan, i aim to relax as much as I could and treat it as a semi-holiday, to recharge for work, and keep affirming myself


Also a goal could be to connect much more with female friends like haton, anwar, and razan, sometimes it is better not to isolate oneself and go out to cafe eat smth sweet and coffee or latte everynow and then helps too.

The ones who actively hated each other somehow ended up at the same tiny community college.

The fine, yellow tinted paper, ever so slightly crumpled in spots, sat against his dirty hands. A rim of coffee stained the corner of it--their daughter accidentally set a mug of coffee on his newspaper earlier in the morning. He studied the headlines of each page carefully, statements from current Mayor, Thomas's, recent meetings and doings lining the page.

""Johnathan! *Now*, please."" His wife addressed him once more, voice sounding a touch angrier than beforehand.

He sighed, folding the papers and placing them down on the hard wood table while standing up.

""What's even wrong with it?"" He asked, turning to the sink and putting his hands on the edge of the counter. The water was murky, traces of scraps from previous meals swimming in the grey, dirtied liquid.

""I'm not sure, that is what I was hoping you would figure out."" She responded, not looking up from her, seemingly very interesting, needles and thread. ""The drain is probably just clogged.""

A noise came from the sink. A deep, almost humming noise radiating from it. Pretty loud, but it was easily drowned out by the tramping of feet in the second story of the house.

Squinting his eyes, John reached his hand down into the solution of food and water, fingers soon grazing against the metallic bottom. He silently searched for the drain, his skin finally feeling the small dip where the type of material changed. He couldn't see his hand at this point, yet could still hear, and feel now, the obnoxious hum seemingly coming from underneath it.

The man huffed, pushing his hand into the hole in attempts to see why it wouldn't work. Water filled around his arm as he dug deeper, and he hit back the plastic flaps lining the edge of the drain. He shoved his arm farther down...

He wasn't able to rip his hand out before the water turned red with blood, blades began slicing into his flesh, tearing up the skin on his fingers.",2,1742409495.0,shortscarystories,0,0.67,False

Life’s more fun when shared with good company, and I’d love to meet someone new—whether it turns into a great friendship or something more, let’s see where it goes!

# 1. Copycat Panera Broccoli Cheddar Soup [Classic Comfort]

# Ingredients:

* 1 tbsp butter
* 1/2 chopped onion
* 1/4 cup melted butter
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 cups half-and-half cream
* 2 cups chicken stock
* 1/2 lb fresh broccoli
* 1 cup grated carrots
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 8 ounces grated sharp cheddar cheese

# Directions:

1. **Sauté the Onions**: In a large pot, melt **1 tbsp of butter** over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until tender.
2. **Make the Roux**: In a separate pot, whisk together **1/4 cup melted butter** and **1/4 cup flour**. Cook until it forms a thick paste.
3. **Combine and Simmer**: Slowly whisk the roux into the chicken stock and half-and-half mixture. Add the broccoli and carrots, then season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
4. **Simmer and Blend**: Allow the soup to simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the vegetables are tender, use an immersion blender to partially puree the soup for a thicker texture.
5. **Add the Cheese**: Stir in the grated cheddar cheese until fully melted and smooth.
6. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and serve immediately, perhaps with a warm bread bowl to complete the Panera experience.

1jf4229,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jf4229,It’s official: She’s going to puppy preschool,"We just picked up our cattle dog/poodle mix puppy, Rhea, this past Friday. She is 9 weeks and giving us a run for our money. Everyday the craziness amplifies, except when we bring her out in public, she is an angel and will sleep/hang out 100% of the time. 

It is hard training a puppy when she doesn’t know how to listen yet or boundaries. Training treats have helped in learning her name and grabbing her attention, but sometimes she is just going ham on the coffee table and I can’t stop her without physically intervening. We are trying to teach her “leave it” command as she chews everything.

She has been going after our 10 year old pomchi (pictured) Miso, playing way too aggressively. She dragged Miso by her tail 4 feet across the floor yesterday. Miso’s fur has been a big trigger and she’s starting to get uncomfortable in her own home which i hate. Miso is spry as ever, and a big player. She loves fetch and running around, but Rhea needs to understand her boundaries and ours. She’ll bite any and everything, drawing a small bit of blood at times on us humans. 

If we can’t correct this behavior within the next month, we are enrolling her in puppy preschool/training. 

Until then, if anyone has advice for a new puppy mom, i would greatly appreciate it. She is obviously a sweet girl and does not know she’s being a gremlin. ",5,1742409083.0,DogAdvice,1,0.86,False

So now that we are on the same page let me explain what you just watched. The fix for conductors (restore 5% HP and AP) in combination with the new onslought mechanic and limit breaking x5 (or nuka dark buff) can turn you into a imortal death machine that has infinite AP in vats. 

Yes youve heard me infinite vats without the need to spam coffee or other consumables and aslong you keep firing and criting every 2nd shot you wont need stims to keep you alive.

If you want infinite AP for the gattling plasma you need at least 400AP cause every 2nd shot you will regenerate 20 AP which is just enough to cover the AP cost (10 per shot) to keep firing. I had those mods on:

\*Furious \*\*+50% crit \*\*\*-25% AP cost \*\*\*\* conductors

For the gattling laser you need ""only"" 240 AP cause the weapon will use 6 AP per shot. You can use the same setup except instead of -25% AP you should put on +50% durability cause the weapon tends to break fast due to its allready high rate of fire.

You will need either 5 pieces of limit breaking or the +18 luck buff you can get from nuka dark to achieve this.",5,1742408966.0,fo76,10,0.7,False

I went to my local coffee shop and bought beans roasted within 7 days. I’ve adjusted my internal burr to ‘3’ - I done this on advice of multiple reviews who advised the factory setting 6 is perhaps too high. 

I’ve loaded my beans and started off by adjusting my grind amount to 14.5 seconds with a grind size of 16. I measure the dose that came out and this was around 22 grams - aiming for the desired 18 grams. The pour time was also a bit short, coming in around 23 seconds. Aiming for 25-30. 

I’ve readjusted the grind amount to 14 in attempt to get closer to 18 grams of espresso. Given the pour time was also a tad short, am I right in thinking I should lower grind size to ensure a slower pour?

⸻

Their Agenda Stinks—Literally and Figuratively:

🚽 Can’t Handle the Truth… or Toilet Paper – So obsessed with banning books, they forgot the golden rule: Wipe front to back, not in a confused zigzag pattern like a malfunctioning Roomba.

🦠 Censorship Over Cleanliness – They want to ban LGBTQ+ books, but maybe they should focus on banning whatever’s brewing between their unwashed toes.

📚 Scrubbing History, Not Themselves – If they fought hygiene half as hard as they fight accurate history, Listerine and Charmin wouldn’t have to do all the heavy lifting.

💨 Febreze Is NOT a Substitute for a Shower – Spraying Axe body spray or rubbing on essential oils doesn’t count as hygiene. And neither does banning sex ed when their own hygiene proves they need it the most.

🚫 Front-to-Back is a Policy Too – If they applied even half the effort they put into banning books toward learning how to use soap, toothpaste, and deodorant, maybe they wouldn’t smell like expired lunch meat in a Florida gas station.

⸻

Hygiene 101 (Because Apparently, They Missed That Lesson Too)

Bathroom Hygiene for Men & Women:

🚽 Wipe Front to Back (Women) – Prevents UTIs and bacterial infections.
🚹 Wipe Until the Paper is Clean (Men) – No, one swipe doesn’t do the job, my guy.
🧻 Use a Fresh Section of Toilet Paper Each Time – No secondhand smears.
💦 Bidets & Wipes Exist—Use Them – A little extra cleanliness never hurt anyone.
👐 Wash Your Hands – With soap. Rinsing doesn’t count.

⸻

Oral Hygiene (Because Your Breath Shouldn’t Smell Like a Rotting Library Book)

🦷 Brush Twice a Day (Yes, Every Day) – Your gums shouldn’t be the same color as your political views (bright red).
🦷 Floss – Food stuck in your teeth since last Tuesday isn’t a personality trait.
🦷 Use Mouthwash – Your breath should not smell like stale coffee, cigarettes, and despair.
🦷 Scrape Your Tongue – Bacteria buildup is not a conspiracy theory.
🦷 Drink Water – Dehydration makes your mouth smell like an abandoned fish market.

⸻

General Hygiene (Because Axe Spray Won’t Save You)

🛁 Shower Daily – Yes, every day. No, “I don’t sweat that much” is not an excuse.
🩲 Change Your Underwear – Yes, daily. No, turning them inside out doesn’t count.
👕 Wash Your Clothes – Smelling like mildew isn’t “patriotic.”
👣 Clean Your Feet – Foot fungus isn’t a personal brand.
👃 Wear Deodorant – Because “natural musk” isn’t working for you.

⸻

Let’s Keep Schools Clean—And Maybe These Folks Too

Say NO to censorship, misinformation, and the Moms (and Dads) Against Hygiene movement. Stand up for real liberty:

✅ Support teachers & students
✅ Keep books on the shelves
✅ Encourage regular bathing, flossing, and wiping

How Dragons of Etchinstone Replaced My Phone During Downtime,"Lately, we've seen more reviews in this subreddit (which is awesome!), so I wanted to try something a little different. This mini-review takes a unique angle on *Dragons of Etchinstone*—one that I hope offers a fresh perspective and sparks some discussion. Let me know what you think of this format, and enjoy the read!

https://preview.redd.it/hrxiyhg7vope1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04b594c81e91c51d5cb1a9b9d6997d3814ea9741

Like most people, I have a bad habit: when I have downtime—whether I’m waiting for coffee, standing in line, or sitting in my car before picking up my kid—I instinctively reach for my phone. A few minutes of “harmless” scrolling inevitably turns into reading an argument in a random comment section, glancing at the tenth “help identify this game piece” thread of the day, or a Wikipedia rabbit hole on the economic policies of 16th-century Sweden. Then, just as quickly, I snap back to reality, feeling like I just wasted my time.

But recently, something changed. Instead of pulling out my phone, I’ve been pulling out *Dragons of Etchinstone*. And honestly? It's been the perfect remedy.

# A Game That Lives in My Pocket

For those who haven’t played it, *Dragons of Etchinstone* is a solo adventure game that somehow crams strategic depth, tactical decision-making, and an epic fantasy quest into just 18 cards. It’s completely **playable in-hand**, meaning you don’t need a table or even much space—you can hold the entire game, shuffle and flip cards, and make meaningful decisions all without spreading anything out.

https://preview.redd.it/jzcummzyuope1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c207737860aaf2b6bd95de2be6b46e4ef8815b9b

I started carrying it around just to see if I’d actually play it outside my usual game sessions. Turns out, it fits perfectly into all those little *in-between moments* of life. While waiting in the school parking lot? Knocked out a few encounters. At the dentist’s office? Made it to the final dragon. Sitting through a long hold on a customer service call?

# Why This Feels So Much Better Than Scrolling

*Dragons of Etchinstone* gives me an actual **sense of progress**. Every decision matters, every challenge has weight, and even if I fail, I’ve gained something—experience. Compare that to doomscrolling, where I might come away feeling mildly entertained at best, exhausted and frustrated at worst.

I didn’t expect such a small, in-hand game to keep me engaged and off my phone, but the **challenge-reward loop** is so tight that it rivals even the best mobile games. Each turn is a quick puzzle that usually ends in a reward, creating an addictive game loop where one turn quickly turns into ten and suddenly, time has flown by. The game culminates in a final dragon battle, where victory always feels earned. That’s a massive upgrade over swiping through a never-ending feed of bad news.

# Could Board Games Be the Antidote to Doomscrolling?

I don’t think I’ll ever be 100% free of my phone—it’s too ingrained in modern life. But I’ve noticed that, when given the choice, I *want* to reach for *Dragons of Etchinstone* instead. It scratches that itch for quick engagement, but in a way that actually feels good. It turns dead time into something enjoyable, rather than just another distraction.

And honestly? I think we could all use a little more of that.

(24F) (25M),"I apologize if I am not typing that clear I am very emotional currently. To give a bit of context…I (24F) have been living with/dating someone (25M)for about a year and yesterday he decided to call my parents to pick me up and then when my parents called me about it and I confronted him, he broke up with me. I found out after I had spent 2 hours getting ready for our date while he was on his way home. Our relationship has been pretty rocky because I’ve been struggling to get a job no matter how much effort i’ve been putting in due to the area i’m currently at and being at home alone with no friends near had really put a strain on my mental health and it got to the point he was unhappy because he didn’t want to feel like he had to worry about me or help me. Us communicating never worked out because it always felt like i was attacking him when i said i had issues or if i said i felt a certain way like “it feels like…” but no matter how i worded my feelings it always couldn’t be compromised or helped or talked through without an argument because he didn’t “want to give in to me” when really i just needed reassurance and even when i had asked for reassurance it always was too much to handle. I currently have no friends and am terrified to make the long cross country drive with my parent that i had made with him on my way to live with him. I feel so alone and like I have no one and I love him so much. I thought we had been happy and I have been doing so much lately to make him happier because he didn’t seem like he was. I would make him breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I always made sure to participate in his hobbies with him whenever he asked. I gave him massages randomly or would write love letters in his lunches. I would stop by and get coffee for him or just small acts that could bring him joy like turning the water on in the shower for him so he could get a few extra seconds of sleep in the morning. I did all the cleaning and chores. I stopped asking for things i really wanted like flowers so he could not feel pressured and do it on his own. I stopped bothering him and I stopped taking my medication since it messed with my hormones and made me more emotional than usual. He told me it was working and told me we were good and everything was fine and i had no need to worry but he apparently lied because he didn’t want to hurt me in those moments. I worked so hard and now i feel empty and so alone while packing. He says that after time apart we might be able to get back together but I don’t know how true that is. How am I supposed to feel better after this. What is the best way to stop feeling the love that I still immensely have for him. How do you get around these things and feelings when you have no friends to do things with. I’m not the best with recovering from relationships and usually I’ve been able to disconnect because my last one never treated me good and cheated on me and I had people to rely on then but now I’m not sure what the best thing to do is.

I feel like part of the reason I enjoyed making coffee was the fact that each order was a mini job that needed to be completed immediately, and I was able to get a good flow going when we had a rush. I also liked that the custom orders were almost like little puzzles to figure out while I went down the checklist of different components in my head.

If you've never had a Lenormand reading before, you'll probably find it interesting, accurate and compelling. I personally find Lenormand to be very direct and literal most of the time, which takes away some of the anxiety and broader interpretations we find in tarot. This doesn't mean it's not capable of deep thought, though, as it definitely provides a lot of insight. 

Lenormand is an French divination system that dates to late 1700s, using cards that originally adapted coffee ground and tea leaf reading elements mixed with playing cards. The Lenormand system was named after Marie Anne Lenormand (Madame Lenormand) in the 1800s, in honor of her perfecting and specializing the cards used in the system. She's interesting! You should look her up if you're not already familiar.
