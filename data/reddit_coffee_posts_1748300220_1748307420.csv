1kwagvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1kwagvy/i_just_dont_understand_the_cause_of_my_low_iron/,I just don't understand the cause of my low iron.,"I used to have a horrible diet a decade ago. Never took care of my body. Over this last decade I have really made changes. I drink mostly water. I drink coffee but only about 1-2 6oz cups roughly 5 days a week (less than I used to). I might drink 1 cup of tea a month. I eat all kinds of food. I LOVE food. My period is not that bad imo. I have 2-3 bad days and a size 2 pad I only have to change about 4 times those 2-3 days (I feel like it could be a lot worse!). I drink beer but not regularly enough. Sometimes a few beers in a night. Sometimes weeks without. All of my labs are good except my iron. I'm baffled why it's so low. I can't recall my ferritin etc but I see my primary doc on Wednesday.  

I was working a physically demanding third shift job for a year until recently. I did start drinking zero sugar monsters some nights because it was getting the best of me ( I thought it was third shift killing my energy but I'm beginning to see it was probably the low iron). So maybe it was the energy drinks?? Couldn't have been night shift right? 

So ready to resolve this. I hate the fatigue and most of all I worry about my heart. I still feel the heart palpitations and chest pain occasionally. I want to be healthy because my kids need me. ",1,1748307231.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False
1kwaf9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1kwaf9a/thoughts_to_help_round_out_this_rough_itinerary/,Thoughts to help round out this rough itinerary?,"My husband and I are taking our four teen / young adult kids for their first trip to Paris this summer - with a few days in the middle of our stay in Norway. Our goal is not to fit in every tourist attraction, but to have some fun experiences together and get a feel for the city. So we are aiming for one (or maybe two) tourist things a day; with remaining time dedicated to wandering / cafes / shopping / dividing our party of six. 

We will be staying near Le Bon Marche right in between 6th / 7th and close to several Metro lines.

Would love any thoughts about what might be nice complements to consider across our rough itinerary. The kids all love eating but not cooking/baking; and some combination of them enjoy coffee, thrifting, shopping, architecture, music, and getting a sense of the queer scene. Might aim to include one more tour or an activity like fragrance making.

Thanks for any thoughts or recos!

1kwae9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/electrical/comments/1kwae9t/running_breville_bambino_plus_on_dji_power_1000/,Running Breville Bambino Plus on DJI Power 1000 - no worky,"I purchased a DJI Power 1000 to occasionally run my Breville Bambino Plus out of my car. The DJI power is rated to continuously run 2600 watts for 30 seconds, and the Bambino supposedly runs at 1560 watts. However when ran through the power station, the heating element on the Breville does not seem to turn on, and the wattage output (seen on the power station display) is only 15 or so watts.

When I plug the power station into the wall, with the otherwise same setup, the heating element works properly, with the output wattage hitting around 1300 watts. If the power bank is rated for 2600 watts for 30 seconds (longer than the coffee machine needs to run a cycle), why is it not able to provide the 1300 watts the coffee machine needs?

Can't figure this out and would love to hear the thoughts of the much brighter minds on this thread!

Wife and I are taking our first trip since our baby was born 7.5 months ago. We are making a quick trip to Irvington from RVA where we are staying in June. Wanted to ask locals or those familiar with the area a few questions. 

1. Food: Recommendations on a casual but quality restaurant for Friday and maybe nicer place Saturday (will make reservation). We both love most food and view is nice but not necessary. Only stipulation is my wife cannot eat gluten (celiacs not preference)

2. Any suggestions on things to do during the day? We are both active and would be open to driving if necessary. General interests: Hiking/scenic walks, coffee addicts, wineries/breweries, beach, exploring cool towns/areas, shopping.

1kwaa23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1kwaa23/sciatic_pain/,Sciatic Pain?,"Hi all! I'm 21(F) and last February (2024), I got really shaky on my left leg. I'm away at college so I went to Urgent Care and they gave me fluids and some steroids. It wasn't going away and they kept having me return to campus health center and urgent care. After 7 rounds of steroids, I got referred to a rheumatologist. I got diagnosed with UCTD because of a positive ANA and fibromyalgia because of pain all over. Then, the UCTD and fibromyalgia diagnoses got switched out for a hypermobility diagnosis in December. Meanwhile, the pain is still there and nothing helps it really (except getting high lol).

My girlfriend drove me to the ER two months ago because my left hand went numb and my left leg got shakier (using her old hiking sticks to walk). They did a bunch of blood tests and an MRI of my head/neck. They said I had a slipped disc, but that it wasn't that significant and shouldn't be causing me this much pain. I got discharged with some ibuprofen and a referral to  PT.

I did the eight weeks of PT that my insurance approved, and it was helping! Certain things would still make it hurt (weather is a big one) but it was a big help. On Friday, I woke up and my left hand was practically completely numb. I spilled coffee over everything. My left leg was very shaky and I was sort of limping to move around. I went to work and dropped a bunch of stuff and my boss drove me to the ER. They didn't do any scans or tests, he just said it was sciatic pain, gave me muscle relaxers and steroids. 

I'm almost out of muscle relaxers and I can feel my foot going numb and tingly again. I have terrible brain fog and confusion, tingling/pins and needles on my skin, headache, blurry vision, dizziness, trouble swallowing, issues with the bathroom (bordering incontinence sometimes), and the tingling and pain is in both legs now. Is this sciatic pain or something else? This feels like something else. I've got an appointment with a neurologist as a follow up from my first ER trip two months ago, coming up and was wondering what things you all think I should bring up/mention.",1,1748306645.0,Sciatica,1,1.0,False

The problem I was having was coffee was killing my appetite. I wasn’t eating more than one meal a day,If any. I was getting body aches,I couldn’t sleep, I felt sick and I was throwing up every morning. 
Now, the only source of caffeine I have is one cup of black tea in the morning. The new problem is every morning I wake up at 5 AM exuding so much energy. Like my eyes burst open. I’m super high energy, extraordinarily friendly, constantly making jokes and I’m talking like 1,000,000 mph. 
I worry I’m going to eventually get on my coworkers nerves. Currently there are no complaints, but I’m already starting to bother me. There’s some upsides though. I’ve never been more productive, but I also can’t stop fun seeking. My appetite now has gone from nothing to I wanna eat everything in sight. Not cause I’m hungry but because I want stimulation. My body is acting like a child and my brain is a disappointment parent. 

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Any tips on how to balance my energy levels out? (Other than taking medication which scares me.)

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; your call.)

**Neuro-divergent mess**—Even simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to forgetting.

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

**First Time Character**— while my quest is to seal the deal and have a family, I am all about exploration and character development.

# **Why I’m Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**—I’ll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you’ll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I’m flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).
- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).
- **Homebodies who never want to explore**—I need a partner-in-crime for actual adventures, not just couch quests.
- **Throwaway accounts**—If your account is less than 3 months old with nothing on it, do not message me. *It basically screams, red flag to me*

# **You Might Be My NPC (Noteworthy Partner Candidate) If You:**

- Believe in ""us against the world"" energy.
- Geek out over D&D backstories, RPG character creators, or Commander deck tech.
- Want someone who’ll bring you tea and listen to your latest 3 AM hyper fixation rant.
- Appreciate **ace-spectrum identities** and emotional intimacy.
- **Love spontaneous adventures**—whether it’s a midnight diner run, a weekend hike, or a last-minute road trip to the world’s largest ball of yarn.

# **The Quest:**

If you’re kind, emotionally mature, and ready to build something real, **message me:“Hi” + your favorite animal + where you read this** (*or I’ll Wild Shape into someone who ghosts you*).

## **Bonus XP if you:**
- Know your D&D alignment with certainty.
- Have ever cried over a fictional relationship.
- Want to argue about MTG’s color pie over coffee.

Let’s write a story where we both get the happy ending. (*And maybe a few detours along the way*)

First off, is there a place where we can either discuss or report bugs for the Watchtower mod? Obviously this is available on Nexusmods, not sure what happens for the Creation ones.

So on this part of the stars have eyes quest, from what I can tell from other gameplay videos, there should be a computer here that opens this door. That doesn't exist for me. I clipped through the wall and also tried just progressing the quest by gathering the listening post intel but that just completes the existing quest marker and then dead ends (no additional quest steps).

I also noticed (relative to other gameplay videos) a lack of a big, lumbering mech? Nothing like that in my game. Anyone know what might be happening here?

Michael was ready when Saw arrived the next day. He had only gotten 5 hours of sleep, but that was nothing a large pot of coffee couldn’t fix. He climbed into the van, trying to ignore the scowl the other man had on his face.

“When we get there, don’t do anything unless I tell you to. I don’t need you fucking this up.”

“Sure,” Michael said, staring out the window.

His stomach was sinking as they got closer to their destination. Two thoughts weighed on his mind. The first was his reluctance to do what Raymond and Saw expected him to do today. The second was his plan to test out how his power worked. It was triggered by the skin-to-skin contact with the last corpse he was handling. The only issue now was getting that contact without Saw noticing. He had a plan for that, but the possibility of failure ate at him almost as much as dismembering and ensuring that what was, for all he knew, an innocent person was never found.

When they pulled up to the house, their job was located. Michael slipped a small folding knife out of his pocket while Saw was turned away. He made a small slit on the index finger of his left glove. He planned to slide that finger along the corpse's skin. Peeling the material back just far enough to make contact. He slipped the knife back into his pocket and began suiting up before Saw noticed anything off.

They made their way through the house and to a bathroom deep inside the home. Michael first noticed that the stench was not nearly as foul, and he soon found out why. Placed in the middle of the bathroom floor was a still, partially frozen woman’s corpse.

“Let’s get started.” Saw opened a fresh roll of plastic sheet.

When the room was fully covered, they moved the still frozen corpse into the shower, and Saw turned on the water, cranking it as hot as it would go. The rest of the ice melted in less than 10 minutes, and they moved the body into the center of the room.

“I hope you are ready for this next part,” Saw said, rummaging around in his tool bag.

Michael executed his plan. He pressed his finger to the corpse, creating enough friction to pull the glove back. Just as his finger made contact, another vision was shown to him. He saw that she could predict 5 seconds into the future and how to activate it, but it did not stop there, as another scene played out in his mind.

He saw a man dressed in all black barging into her home. She tried to fight back, predicting his movements, but something strange happened. She let out a scream a second before the man grabbed her left arm. Ice quickly spread over her body until she was frozen solid with a horrified expression on her face. Michael began to sweat as he fell back from the woman.

Saw glared at him. “If that makes you squeamish, you’re going to hate this next part.”

Michael looked down to see the man holding a newly severed arm and nearly threw up in his mouth. A metallic scent filled the room as blood poured from the corpse and onto the plastic sheeting. Saw popped the lid off a large plastic bucket he had Michael carry inside. A soft sizzling sound emanated throughout the room as Saw lowered the severed limb into the concoction within.

He held out a small device that looked like a cast saw to Michael. “You get the other arm, and I’ll start working on the legs.”

Michael emerged from the bathroom an hour later, white as a sheet. Saw had him remove his hazmat suit and gloves, wrapping it all up with the plastic sheeting and placing it in a large trash bag. Michael made his way toward the front door. He needed some fresh air after that. A photo on the wall caught his attention as he was leaving. Michael’s eyes widened as he stared. Two sets of eyes peered back at him. The woman he had just helped dispose of, and a small child who looked to be no older than 7 years old. Unable to contain it anymore, Michael ran into the kitchen and puked into the sink.

It took another half hour for him to sanitize the sink after Saw found out. The man had been pissed off at the delay, but Michael could not have cared less at that point. He silently stared out the window the entire drive home, and when he was finally back at his apartment. He collapsed on the bed, curling into a ball. Michael stayed like that for hours until his phone rang. He reluctantly grabbed it and checked the caller ID. A large sigh escaped his lips as he saw Raymond's name. He pushed himself up, sitting on the edge of the bed, and accepted the call.

“Hello.”

“Null! Heard, you did great out there today, well, except for the mess you left in the sink. So, you're an accessory to murder now. How does it feel to get your first big boy charge?”

“What do you really want?”

“Oh, someone feeling guilty about what they have done?” Raymond mocked.

“I said. What do you want, Raymond?!”

The line went silent for a few moments. Michael panicked. He had overstepped. He could count the number of times he had accidentally called Raymond by his first name on one hand, and all of them had ended with a brutal beating.

A sigh came from the other end of the line. “I know we have talked about this before, Null, but I don’t want to hear my name come out of your worthless mouth ever… You got that?”

Michael gulped. “Yes, sir, sorry, sir.”

“Good, I’ll let it slide this one time as a celebration of your first murder charge, but if it happens again. I might just take one of your fingers… I could start a collection, ya know. Ha, that’s great. Hey, Wonder, couldn’t you see me collecting fingers-”

The call ended as Raymond's voice drifted further away. Michael let out a sigh of relief and collapsed backward. He still needed to test out if he could use that new power, but he was far too exhausted for that now. His eyes slowly shut, and he drifted off, dreaming of a better tomorrow.

Hindi Ito Personal, Ito ay Prinsipyo**

Simulan sa paglilinaw:

*Ang panawagan ng boycott ay hindi dahil sa inggit, politika, o personal na galit. Ito ay paninindigan laban sa mga taong paulit-ulit na nagiging sanhi ng pasakit sa mamamayan habang kumikita sa kalbaryo ng iba.*

Bilang tao, dangal na natin ang niyurakan. Ang prinsipyo ay may karapatan tayo sa malinis na tubig(ayon din ito sa konstitusyon)

SECTION 9. The State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all. 

Ang batas ay bahagi ng tungkulin ng Estado na tiyakin ang access ng tao sa **de-kalidad at makatarungang serbisyong panlipunan**, kabilang ang tubig. Kung walang pananagutan ang mga water provider, nilalabag nito ang obligasyon ng Estado na protektahan ang karapatan ng mamamayan.

**Right to Health and Sanitation (Article XIII, Section 11)**

*“The State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development... There shall be priority for the needs of the underprivileged sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children.”*

Tubig ay hindi luho — **pangkalusugan ito.** Ang batas ay hindi lang para sa efficiency kundi para sa **proteksyon ng buhay** at kalusugan ng publiko.

**2. PrimeWater: Singil Kahit Walang Serbisyo**

Pagmomonopolyo ng tubig sa maraming LGUs

JVA deals na hindi kinonsulta sa publiko

Wala nang ligtas na opsyon — kahit ayaw mo sa PrimeWater, wala kang choice

***“You cannot boycott PrimeWater. You can only endure it.”***

Kaya ang boycott ay dapat ilipat sa mga produkto nilang *maaari mong piliing hindi tangkilikin.*

Ang nangyayari sa ngayon, lumalabas na wala na tayong choice dahil Primewater na ang kasama sa JVA ngayon. Ang sistema, kahit hindi maayos ang serbisyo magbabayad ka pa rin, dahil may basic charge pa kahit wala kang konsumo. Kung sa Primewater ay ginawang sapilitan sa atin dahil basic commodity ito. Makatwiran lang naman na hindi na tayo magbigay pa ng pera sa kanila sa ibang serbisyo.

**3. Konsumerismo ang Sandata: Kung Di Ka Puwedeng Makaiwas sa PrimeWater, Umiwas sa Iba Nilang Negosyo**

Listahan ng mga Villar-affiliated na negosyo:

AllHome, AllDay, Coffee Project, Vista Mall, Camella, Lumina, Bria Homes, etc.

Hindi ito simpleng negosyo — bahagi ito ng isang sistemang nagpapayaman sa kanila habang ang publiko ay nagpapasan ng palpak na serbisyo.

Sabihin mo:

*“Kung hindi natin kayang tanggalin agad ang kontrata ng PrimeWater, kaya natin silang patawan ng pressure sa ibang bahagi ng negosyo nila.”*

**4. Wala Kang Utang na Loob sa Serbisyong Pinagbayaran Mo**

Pondo ng taumbayan ang ginagamit sa “libreng palibing,” ayuda, at mga proyekto

Hindi ito regalo ng politiko — ito ay responsibilidad nila

Pero ipinapresenta nila itong parang “utang na loob” ng mga tao sa kanila

**Ito ang dahilan kung bakit nahihirapan tayong panagutin sila.**

Hindi dapat tayo matakot kung mawawala ang mga serbisyong laan naman talaga sa atin kung sakaling mag-iba ang namumuno sa lugar nio, dahil puede tayong magdemand, dahil taxpayers tayo at may karapatan tayo sa services ng gobyerno. Ang mga services na ito ay nagmumukhang galing sa mga pulitiko, na animo'y galing sa sarili nilang bulsa, pero hindi talaga dahil, galing din ito sa binabayaran nating buwis. Hindi ito regalo ng mgal pulitiko

**5. Kung Walang Accountability, May Power ang Collective Action**

Kung isa-isa tayong tumigil sa pag-suporta, maliit ang epekto

Pero kung sabay-sabay tayong magpasya, nararamdaman ito

Hindi mo kailangang magsimula ng rebolusyon — magsimula ka lang sa *sariling desisyon* mo bilang mamimili

Pwede mong sabihin:

*“Hindi ka powerless. Lahat ng piso mo ay boto rin — boto kung sino ang yayaman, at sino ang dapat mawalan.”*

Hindi laging kailangan ng martsa at megaphone para magkaroon ng lakas ang taumbayan. Ang **coordinated boycott** ay tahimik pero makapangyarihang porma ng protesta. Pwede itong i-frame sa article bilang *“modern, strategic resistance”* na kayang gawin ng kahit sinong ordinaryong mamamayan, kahit hindi lumabas ng bahay.

**Tahimik Pero Matindi: Boycott Bilang Protesta**

Hindi mo kailangang magwelga sa lansangan o sumigaw sa harap ng mall para magpadama ng paninindigan. Kapag sabay-sabay ang mga mamamayan na hindi na bumibili sa negosyo ng mga ganid sa kapangyarihan, *mas ramdam nila ito kaysa sa anumang sigaw sa kalsada*.

Ang boycott ay:

Legal

Tahimik

Di nangangailangan ng permit

Di ma-haharass ng pulis

Pero napaka-epektibo kung sabay-sabay

*“Kapag di na bumibili ang mamamayan, bumabagsak ang negosyo. At kapag nabawasan ang kita ng isang political dynasty, napipilitan silang makinig.”*

Hindi mo kailangang maging aktibista. Hindi mo kailangang maging sikat. Kailangan mo lang gumawa ng isang tahimik pero makapangyarihang desisyon: **“Hindi na ako bibili sa mga produkto ninyo.”**

**6. Panawagan: Please share, Magpaliwanag, Mag-boycott**

Total naniningil ang PRIMEWATER kahit palpak ang serbisyo nila. Makatwiran lang naman siguro na IBOYCOTT O HUWAG NANG TANGKILIKIN LAHAT NG NEGOSYO NILA. TOTAL NAGING PASAKIT NAMAN SILA SA TUMBAYAN, SINGILIN DIN NATIN ANG MGA VILLAR.",1,1748305892.0,pinoy,1,1.0,False

Even with high-quality devices, the accuracy of results depends heavily on proper usage.

Below are four common mistakes individuals often make when monitoring blood pressure at home, along with evidence-based recommendations for improving reliability.

# 1. Measuring Too Soon After Eating, Drinking, or Physical Activity

Why it matters:  
Blood pressure can temporarily increase after consuming caffeine, eating, or engaging in physical activity. Measuring during this period may result in artificially elevated readings.

Recommendation:  
Wait at least 30 minutes after meals, coffee, smoking, or any physical exertion before taking a measurement. Ensure the individual is in a calm, resting state.

# 2. Incorrect Sitting Position During Measurement

Why it matters:  
Poor posture—such as slouching, crossing legs, or allowing the arm to hang unsupported—can alter the pressure in peripheral arteries, affecting the accuracy of the reading.

Recommendation:  
Have the patient sit upright, with their back supported, feet flat on the floor, and their arm supported at heart level on a firm surface. Avoid any conversation or movement during measurement.

# 3. Using the Wrong Cuff Size

Why it matters:  
Cuff size must be appropriate to the circumference of the upper arm. A cuff that is too tight or too loose may distort the reading, leading to over- or underestimation of blood pressure.

Recommendation:  
Measure the circumference of the upper arm and ensure the cuff matches the recommended size range. Most manufacturers offer standard and large cuff options—choose accordingly.

# 4. Taking Only One Reading

Why it matters:  
Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day. A single reading may not reflect the average blood pressure level, particularly if taken under suboptimal conditions.

Recommendation:  
Take 2–3 consecutive readings, spaced 1 minute apart, and record the average. This is the approach recommended by most clinical guidelines for home monitoring.

# Observed Benefits of Improved Technique:

* Increased consistency in blood pressure trends
* Reduced patient anxiety from occasional high readings
* Greater physician confidence in home logs for treatment decisions
* Improved patient understanding of their cardiovascular health

Conclusion:  
Home monitoring of blood pressure can be an invaluable tool when performed correctly. Patients and caregivers should be educated on best practices and encouraged to review their technique periodically.

Should you have questions or wish to share your experience with blood pressure monitoring, feel free to contribute. Peer learning and shared experiences are powerful tools for collective health improvement.

In its early days it was known to be solidly Pentecostal in its doctrine and practice. But after visiting a few Aog churches and being involved with one now nearby, I’ve noticed that’s there’s a lack of that initial fire. Speaking in tongues is not something you really hear or even talked about. Most of the more “supernatural” gifts are reserved for small groups, and even then aren’t that emphasized. The baptism of the Holy Spirit, the key distinct practice that separates charismatics from other churches, is rarely brought up. With maybe the pastor dedicating one sermon a year about it.

Maybe it’s just my area, but the aog seems to have adapted a more seeker sensitive approach. Emphasizing trendy churches with coffee bars, but no longer chasing the power and manifestations of the Spirit. While I do believe we should never emphasize one aspect of God over others(which sadly many Pentecostal churches tend to do) the AG seems to have brushed them aside, only bringing them up privately in intimate settings.

Those were originally two robust and slender golden and black fish tails, but now their tail fins have been bitten off by piranhas, the jagged cuts are still bleeding, and the scales on the tails have been plucked away, leaving only dark red furrows so deep that you can see the white fish bones that were broken off inside.

I was wrapped in red seawater, the gray bottom of the sea through a few glimpses of light, that tragic scene happened right in front of me. I heard chirping sounds around me that could penetrate my brain, sad, desperate, painful ......

The owners of the two fish tails, a female and a male, the male with a crown on his head and the female with long hair flowing, had fish hooks under their chains running through their chest cavities and chains stretching out to the sea. They hung their heads low, their hair lost its luster, as if they were already dead, but when I looked at them, they looked at me too.

""Don't make a sound!"" Their voices rang out in my head. I obeyed their words and shut my mouth tightly, a feeling of panic gradually rising up in my heart.

At that moment, a shadow came swimming in the distance. When the shadow came closer, I realized that it was a huge shark, its body covered almost the entire sea, the faint light was completely blocked. It had a large blood-red mouth, revealing two rows of sharp, dense teeth inside, staring greedily at the two mermaids.

The uneasiness in my heart became more and more obvious, and I wanted to go and save them. But they stared at me, their eyes were bleeding, and they begged me bitterly, ""My baby, don't come out, please, don't come out!""

I don't know why, but my body suddenly couldn't move either, and my heart spread endless fear and sadness.

The giant shark came behind them, bending its head down to press them, the bloody mouth opened more ...... a blink of an eye, the two mermaids only the lower half of the broken tail, from the fish hook slowly floating down, falling deeper into the sea floor.

I looked stupidly at the two broken tails, and suddenly, a sharp, vicious gaze locked onto me.

\--It's the giant shark. I've been spotted!

""Ah...""

I woke up in a sweat and was greeted with a basin of cold water, the icy coldness of which immediately woke me up with barely a cushion. I wiped a handful of water from my face in a panic, gasped for air, and looked over at the middle-aged woman standing by my bed, ""Sorry, Mom, did I wake you up again?""

This is my adoptive mother, with her high sparse eyebrows, bags drooping under her eyes, and angry eyes drawn with blood. Clearly, she had not rested well. The house is not soundproof, and my shrieking woke her up again, and not for the first time. Every time she was woken up by me, she would splash me with cold water, just like she did earlier.

""Heather, if you do that again, get your ass out on the street and sleep!"" The foster mother crossed her arms in anger, a copper basin at her feet, the one they used to wash their feet.

I suddenly felt a fluttering in my stomach, but did not dare to show it. I was a found child and grew up playing my best use, with endless work to do every day. Such days were acceptable after getting used to them, until after I turned seventeen, when I began to have constant nightmares.

I could only sleep for two hours a night, during which I kept having the same nightmare, while in reality I would scream unconsciously, thus waking up my adoptive parents and provoking their verbal abuse and chastisement.

During the day, I still have to fight to work, without a moment's pause. Even if my eyelids are about to stick together, I have to hold them up hard. I seem to be a spinning gyroscope, constantly running, the spirit has faced a breakdown.

I have to find a way out of the mess I'm in or I don't know how much longer I can hold out. A woman in my nightmares told me to go to Reims City before I turned eighteen or I would be haunted by nightmares all the time. I couldn't make up my mind before because I didn't believe in such bizarre things, until now when things are getting worse and I have no choice but to believe.

""I'm really sorry, Mom, I didn't mean it."" I sincerely expressed my apology, and before my foster mother got angry again, I said to her again, ""Can we talk? About my marriage.""

""What is there to talk about, your father and I have decided to marry you to the captain, when you arrive at the captain's house still can not change the problem of shouting in the middle of the night, your husband will not treat you so gently as I do!"" The adoptive mother's voice was shrill.

""I don't want to marry the captain, Mother.""

""It's not up to you, we've raised you so ......""

""I know!"" I raised my voice to interrupt what she was about to say, something she had said many times before, ""I know you raised me this way just to sell me for a good price, but ......""

I paused, swallowed a few times, and said a little nervously, ""But, Mom, that's not my best price, I deserve more!""

""Ha, you girl, what kind of beautiful dream are you having?"" The foster mother unsurprisingly showed a mocking look, ""Think you're some kind of noble lady? The captain is the best place for you to be.""

""Do you remember Mary? Mother, she wrote to me last week."" I said quickly, ""Mary told me that she has an estate of her own in Reims City with endless servants, beautiful gardens, and a wide lawn .......""

Mary, the girl I grew up with, whose parents both died at sea, left here a few months ago, saying she wanted to see other places. After I expressed my admiration and blessings for her, she urged me to leave with her, and although I wanted to do that very much, I finally declined her invitation.

I was scared of the unknown and couldn't leave my adoptive parents, who had given me a home despite their constant chastisement, but now I had to leave. In fact, I hadn't received a letter from Mary in a long time, but I had to use this excuse to coax my foster parents into taking me to Reims City.

Hearing my words, my foster mother's eyes grew wide, filled with envy, and she didn't even seem to be drowsy anymore. She marveled, ""My God, how can this child be so rich? I thought she had died at sea long ago.""

""Of course she had no money, Mary was penniless when she left, and she was even dumber than I was, and average looking, yet she married a rich man, and the villa was given to her by him."" I said to my foster mother.

Please do forgive me Mary , you are a brave and beautiful girl in my heart and I really don't want to say that about you.

""Is it true? God, how can she be so lucky!"" The foster mother excitedly put her palms together and made a prayer, ""If only I had a life like hers!""

""But you already have an adoptive father, even though you don't have any children."" I said awkwardly, ""But that's okay, Mother, you still have me don't you?""

""If I could meet a rich man like that, I would give you and your foster father a rich life in your old age. If you just marry the captain, you will get too little."" I said to her sadly.

""Heather, what do you mean by that? Are you still not rich enough for the captain?"" My foster mother looked at me with a displeased frown, but did not immediately issue a rebuke, and I knew she was beginning to have a heart attack.

""The captain may be a rich man in our area, but he is nothing in Reims City. mary said there are many rich people in Reims City, and if I go to the noble school there, I have a chance to marry into one of those rich families."" I told my mother what I was thinking.

My foster mother's eyes widened and her eyes looked at me sharply, ""That's simply impossible, you still want to go to an expensive school, where did your father and I get the money?""

""You guys ...... don't you still have some savings? The money I've earned from weaving fishing nets over the past few years has been given to you."" I looked at my foster mother and whispered, biting my lip.

Many people here know how to make fishing nets, but the nets I make are cheap and strong, so everyone likes to buy them from me. In order to ease the burden on my adoptive parents, I also knit in the winter and get a lot of frostbite on my hands. But every time I give all the money to my parents, I don't even have money left to buy frostbite medicine.

My adoptive mother's eyes rolled around, not knowing what had occurred to her, and suddenly stepped forward and grabbed me by the hair: ""That's all you're supposed to give us! Are you trying to cheat us out of some money and then run away?!""

""No, mom, calm down!"" My scalp tingled from her tugging and I explained with difficulty, ""I mean, we'll go to Reims City together and you can open a coffee shop there. I'm sure I can't run away with you guys watching me, and I can't leave you guys behind.""

My adoptive mother loosened her grip a bit, and I immediately held her hand, ""Mom, believe me! I just want to give you a better life to repay your kindness to me, without you I would have died long ago.""

""Hey, let go of your hand, it's cold as death!"" My foster mother shook off my hand in disgust and let go of my hair as well. I cowered my shoulders and looked at her timidly, ""I wouldn't dare lie to you, Mom.""

""It better be!"" My foster mother glared at me and warned me, ""I still have to discuss this matter with your father, so don't get any bad ideas, or he'll beat you to death!"" My foster mother wiggled her fat ass and turned around and left the room.

I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the door was closed. The sheets and cotton wool were wet with cold water, and I could only shrink on the worn-out sofa, barely closing my eyes for a while, but I was still a bit apprehensive.

Fortunately, the adoptive father happened to meet a yacht from Reims City at sea this time, and the rich people were singing and dancing all night on the deck of the yacht, spreading expensive wine and champagne to the sea, trying their best to show their luxury.

In contrast, my father could only blow in the cold on a small rickety boat. In strong contrast, my adoptive father was deeply unjust and jealous, longing for the life of the rich people, and I was the only bargaining chip he had to achieve such a life.

My adoptive father did not question too much about my proposed opinion, although he was a bit hesitant, and after reading the letter I wrote in Mary's imitation handwriting, he agreed to my request.

The day before the captain's visit, my foster father took my mother and me away from the place where I grew up. We left by train in the evening to avoid being caught up by the captain.

It would actually be faster to take a boat, but I suffer from a phobia of the deep sea, and although I live by the sea, I rarely go near it. My adoptive parents, counting on me to marry a good man, treated me much better, and when I asked to take the train, they agreed to do so, despite their unhappy faces.

We left at night and the train let out a whistle and began to move slowly. Looking out of the glass window at the night and the stars twinkling in the night, I was filled with a sense of longing and anticipation for a new life.

# Chapter 2

Aemon's POV:

""Bang!"" After a loud bang, my father's roar and my mother's nagging were finally isolated in the door, but I knew it was only temporary.

I quickly ran to the window at the end of the hallway and glanced outside. Before I could get a good look, the door that had been closed was opened again. I didn't have time to hesitate any longer and jumped straight down.

Fortunately, there are no passers-by downstairs, otherwise I really do not know how to explain to each other - from the sixth floor jumped down from the person not only did not fall to death but also can continue to run the strange phenomenon.

""Aemon! You better not come back ever! You little bastard!""

My father's suppressed roar sounded behind me, and I pretended not to hear it as I ran forward as fast as I could run. I could have run faster, but I was worried that a passerby might see me.

Because it is impossible to reach the running speed of a werewolf with human body functions, and I am a werewolf living in a human city in seclusion.

Today is my eighteenth birthday, which should be a happy day, and my father and mother are trying to tie me back to the Busa Forest. They want me to marry Bonnie, but I just think of the girl I've met a few times as a sister.

Busa forest is our habitat, but because of the excessive cutting of trees by humans, some wolves have to live in the city. When I was a wolf cub, I was brought to the city by my parents, and they would bring me back to Busa Forest every year.

I like who I am and I like the Busa Forest, where I can feel free. But I received a human education and integrated into human society. My mother and father were just looking at Bonnie's family power to say she was my destined mate. i would not marry Bonnie because i had no love for her at all.

""You're doing great. You should have left that house a long time ago!"" My wolf said in my head, always rebellious and always egging me on to become just like him.

""Rick, now you are happy, if I am taken back by my father, the unlucky one is me."" I said to it helplessly, but I did not stop running.

Back at the boarding school, my father didn't come after me, I guess he was angry. But I don't regret rebelling against him, happiness has to be earned, after all, it is me, not my father, who will live with MATE for the rest of my life.

Another week went by and my father never came to me, which was great, I think I beat my fate!

But while I was still in the midst of my joy, a predicted problem came to me.

\--My rut is here.

The teacher was lecturing at the podium, a middle-aged female teacher without expression, lecturing like a machine gun, except that the bullets she sent out were hypnotic ammunition. There are already a lot of people around who are asleep, and I'm sitting in the corner, and even less people will pay attention to this side.

My eyes were still fixed on the blackboard, but my hand couldn't help but slip down and lift the crotch of my pants, and the dick inside became even bigger, pulsating restlessly in my underwear.

Even though I had already hit the inhibitor this morning, the stuff didn't seem to work for me, maybe because it was my first heat.

My body seemed to be baking in a blazing fire, and it was very scorched from the inside out. If anyone were to eat a cooked egg right now and put it anywhere on my body, it would be instantly cooked. But the most unbearable thing was the instinctive desire to mate, which kept rolling around in my belly like hot lava desperately looking for an outlet.

""Aemon, you should find a woman to mate with right now, or we're all doomed!"" My wolf growled angrily inside my head as it tried to take control of my body.

I had to stop it. Rick was a crazy guy, and if I let it take control of my body, the school would become chaotic, and my identity would be exposed to humans.

I tried to suppress this desire, but I couldn't help but sweep my eyes towards the females in the class, and looking at their perfect curves, I had a strong desire to jump on them.

At this moment, even though I didn't want to admit it, I felt the difference between myself and humans, I was a beast that couldn't master my desires, and it annoyed me to no end.

My sanity gradually collapsed and I ran out of the classroom in front of the surprised eyes of the crowd. I quickly ran forward, through the school building, cafeteria, playground, I came to the back of the school cedar forest.

This is a place where the school is rumored to be haunted, and no one generally dares to come over. I couldn't wait to strip naked and run wild in the woods, trying to release the damn desire in my body in this way.

But it didn't help at all, my body became hotter and my brain seemed to burn. I began to stop expecting the desire to go away and instead longed for a female to appear in front of me and then pounce on her hard and penetrate her hard.

""It's useless, how can there be a she-wolf here, you useless guy, wait here to die!"" Rick kept complaining in my head, his voice rough, obviously he was having a hard time too.

""Unless you go back now and find a she-wolf ......"" Rick's rawness stopped abruptly.

I don't know if I was hallucinating, but when I was in the middle of the runway, I really saw a young girl. Her back was to me, I could only see her wearing a blue plaid dress, long gray-blue curly hair hanging around her slender waist, half of her white calves exposed ......

So tempting.

The most charming thing is the smell of her body, which is a fresh and sweet smell. Indulging in this smell will give me the illusion of being in the ocean.

""Hey, pussy, what are you waiting for? Get on it!"" My wolf started screaming in my head again, ""If you're being shy, you can give me control of your body, I won't be as timid as you are!""

I heeded Rick's words and took a step forward, when I suddenly rang a bell with my mother's words, who had said in her persuasion that werewolves in heat would be burned to death by the rising temperature if they couldn't settle their desires. But she also said that werewolves can only mate with female wolves because human girls simply can't withstand the body temperature of werewolves and will be burned to death during the mating process.

""Shut up, you can't do that Rick, she's only human!"" I suppressed my wolf with what was left of my willpower.

There was some barren grass in the woods, and now the sun had just risen and the morning mist had turned into dewdrops resting on the tips of the grass. The girl lifted her skirt up a bit to prevent it from getting wet, revealing more of her white skin.

This is just seducing me!

Suddenly, the girl spun on her toes and looked like she was about to turn around. I immediately retracted my body back behind the trunk, my heart pounding, and waited a moment before I carefully poked one eye out to see her again.

The girl turned only halfway, slightly tilting her neck, to the beam of light penetrating the leaves, her face a very pleasant smile.

Luckily, her eyes were closed so I was able to ogle her with abandon. I was simply stunned, I had never seen such a perfect face, even if it was a side face, which made the lava in the small of my back jump even more happily.

""Damn it, Aemon, are you a man or not? You better behave and give me control of your body!"" My wolf hissed angrily in my head as it snatched my body.

My breathing became increasingly ragged and my sanity was close to the edge of complete collapse ......

Heather's POV:

Today is my first day at Gnas School, the best aristocratic school in Reims City, and my adoptive parents have indeed gone to great lengths to enable me to hook up with rich people. I guess they used up all their savings and put all their chips on me, which makes me a little uneasy that they might just sell me to a brothel if they knew I cheated on them.

Now that the foster parents were still talking in the principal's office, they asked me to sit outside in the lounge. After sitting in the lounge for a while, I couldn't resist my curiosity and walked out of the lounge.

It was a gorgeous, spacious campus, twice as big as the school in Sfield. I could see the rubber track and fake grass enclosing the field, which was more like a playground than a weed-covered wasteland.

I only went to school for three years in the small town of Sfield. My foster parents forbade me to go back to school after the tuition fees went up, and they wouldn't have sent me to school if I hadn't told them that there would be more chances to meet rich people in an aristocratic school.

I don't know when I came to a desolate and dilapidated area, and I was surprised to see the scene in front of me. It turns out that even the most gorgeous places have crumbling corners. This place, like me, looked out of place in such an environment. After walking through the dilapidated house with only concrete and steel, I walked into a cedar forest, which was overgrown with weeds, but permeated with the vitality of nature.

I like this place better than the previous building. The air is fresher here, the sun is warmer, and there are still dew drops left on the grass from the early morning. I couldn't help but want to sing, so I closed my eyes and whispered the familiar songs in my head.

This is the song taught to me by the conch, which my adoptive father fished for when he was fishing. When I told my adoptive parents that the conch could sing, they didn't believe me. Even when I sang the song and got their compliments, they just thought I made it up.

But I was happy to get their praise, and after that, I learned many more songs from the conch. When I'm in a bad mood, I just sing this song and I feel calm.

Near the end of the song, I suddenly heard a strange sound, like the sound of a man's heavy breathing.

At the same time, I felt a fiery sight staring back at me! I snapped open my eyes, and before I could adjust to the light, I saw a white figure flashing back quickly. Someone was really spying on me and eavesdropping on my singing!

I felt very angry and quickly chased after him. But the man ran so fast that I only had time to catch a glimpse of his broad, white back and upturned buttocks.

Hey, hope it’s cool to post this here, I apologize in advance if it's not.

My band Direwolf just released our fourth single, and since Trivium has been a massive influence on us (for real, we were basically raised via Trivium, Machine Head, and Stone Cold Steve Austin), I figured this might be a corner of the internet where y'all might be interested in our stuff.

We’re from the Maritimes of Canada, and we are releasing our debut full-length album next month. In Trivium terms, the sound falls somewhere between Shogun and The Crusade. 

No label, just DIY and a lot of riffs and coffee. Check us out if you’re curious:

There are moments where I felt like he would show interest in me and vice versa. However, we got close at such a slow pace because we always hung out during a group setting as we are both in the same club. By the end of the school year, I confessed to him that I had a crush on him  but I was not ready to be in a relationship which is why in some way I held back in getting to be close with him and apologized for any mixed signals. He was speechless and didn’t know what to say but texted if I can have coffee with him. 

When I had coffee with him he also told me he shared the same feelings for me and for two hours we just talked about each other. He also told me he felt like he’s not ready to be in a relationship due to focusing in studies and we just both talked how we are not ready because of different priorities. He then asked me what should we do now like be friends or start seeing each other (like not allowed to talk to other people). I was just honest and said we should just be friends for now since he will be travelling for two minths during summer. He then asked about after summer and I said we shouldn’t make decisions based on the future because we could change and change our decision. Anyways, we both said goodbye and I felt this bittersweet feeling because after that conversation I realized I did want to be in a relationship with him because I felt so safe talking to him but the timing is just off as he will be away.

The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Monday now, the coffee chat was on Wednesday of last week). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

I can’t stand my workmate anymore and I’m stuck with him as my deputy head for another year,"I (23F) have been working in musical theatre as a mic tech for the past 3 years. I love my job and I’m incredibly passionate about it — it’s everything I’ve dreamed of. I have the best coworkers, and it truly feels like a family.

But for the past year, my deputy head (26M) has been behaving and working in all the wrong ways. He stopped doing his track during the show and just stopped helping overall. He wouldn’t even ask if I needed help with the mics — even when he was free and I was still working. All the time, after I finish the sound check, I help the person doing the mic run so we can finish earlier and have a coffee together. But he NEVER offers to help.

Another example of his poor work ethic: sometimes, when he leaves to check that the musicians are in place before the show, he just disappears for hours and only returns to the mic room right before the act ends. He doesn’t say where he’s going or what he’s doing. Nothing. He just vanishes with no explanation. If he were doing something work-related — like listening to the show FOH or talking to our boss — I would understand. But I know he just wanders around the theatre, sometimes playing piano in the rehearsal room, other times chatting with random technicians, or honestly doing God knows what.

He leaves the rest of our team to continue working while he’s off on his little “breaks,” completely unaware — or uncaring — about the work we still have to finish before we can leave.

He’s displayed so much unprofessional behavior, and I’ve had enough.

Our head of sound had a talk with the whole team and basically told us we needed to step up, because she felt we were slacking off (which was partially true — we had been on the same musical for 2 years at that point). We all made an effort to work harder and kept that up. But he didn’t. She even spoke to him directly, pointing out specific situations he needed to improve — and he still kept doing things wrong. So we all eventually lost our patience with him.

On top of that, it’s really hard to talk to him about anything serious. He always plays the victim, only thinks about himself, and honestly comes off as a narcissistic.

Last month we were told what we’d be doing next season. The musical I’m currently working on is going on tour, but unfortunately, I’m not going with it (which really hurt — I had dreamed about and manifested going on tour). Instead, I’m staying at the same theatre but moving to a different musical. At first, I was excited — the new project seemed great. The only thing I was sure of was that I did not want to work with that same deputy head again.

At first, he was assigned to be the local sound tech for the theatre, which meant I’d only have to work with him if he filled in for someone — not ideal, but at least he wouldn’t be my direct boss again.

But this week, everything changed. He got called in to be the deputy head for the new musical I’m working on. Turns out, the person who was originally going to take that role quit, and the company had no one else available. They were actually about to fire him, but ended up giving him another chance — first as the local tech, and now as my direct superior again.

And now I don’t know how to deal with it, because I seriously can’t stand him anymore. He gets on my nerves and drains me emotionally so quickly. Lately, it’s been harder and harder to snap out of that mindset. I feel drained even before going to work, and when I come home, I bring all that negativity with me.

If he acts the same way in the new musical, I honestly don’t know what I’ll do. I can’t keep coming home completely exhausted because of one person. And the worst part is, I feel totally alone in this — because I’m the only one who knows the full extent of what he used to do, how he actually worked, and how much he dragged the team down.

AIO for feeling this way?

I gave up drinking coffee when I moved to the UK cause it didn't come close to back home, 6 months later and I'm doing a late shift at the bar without a wink of sleep the night before - I knew I'd need some caffeine to get me through the shift.

So I did what any reasonable person would do and did a double shot of espresso into a glass of coke. It didn't taste great, but I was BOUNCING off the walls. My dutch coworker asked if she could have a taste and she didn't mind it, and asked me what I'd call the concoction. 

I thought about it for a minute and said it's got coffee, and coke, but no vodka - so it's like a Virgin Black Russian. She chuckled and said if you did it with milk instead of coke that'd be a Virgin White Russian, so I looked at her and said

1kw9k7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/1kw9k7k/community_groups_the_mole_people_of_edge_hill/,"[Community groups] The mole people of Edge Hill - secret underground tunnels, pointless infighting and financial ruin in Liverpool","Most people know the UK city of Liverpool for The Beatles, their three football teams (including Tranmere Rovers) and having an accent that can be nearly incomprehensible to outsiders. Almost no one knows Liverpool as the site of one of the largest, most impressive, mysterious and bizarre complexes of underground tunnels in the world - but it is.

Edge Hill is an unassuming and somewhat deprived area sitting on the eastern edge of the city. Once home to the first intercity railway in the UK and a thriving, wealthy merchant population, it is now full of student flats, abandoned factories and tyre yards. Even the university bearing its name has long fled 13 miles north to Ormskirk. But in the 1800s, Edge Hill was a desirable area, away from the pollution of the Industrial Revolution, allowing the elite to look down upon the city that was building their wealth. One of the people responsible for this was the person who built these tunnels - Joseph Williamson. It's also home to obsessive groups of people fighting - often with each other - to understand who he was, why he built these tunnels, and just how many more of them are there, waiting underground to be discovered.

Disclaimer - I am not involved with any of the groups I've written about here, although I have entertained thoughts of signing up but I don't think it would work - many of them are of retirement age and have much more time on their hands than me. I'm just someone who loves underground structures, went on a few of the tours, chatted to the volunteers and became obsessed with the tunnels, the story, and the strange, dedicated people who are trying to bring them to public attention. I think this sort of story is like a moth to a flame for a very particular kind of weirdo, and I recently learned that I am definitely that type. As many of those types exist on this subreddit, you might be too.

**Who was Joseph Williamson?**

This is hard to answer. Wiliamson was a secretive and deeply weird man, and not even the competing groups of volunteers dedicated to his legacy can properly agree on his history. He didn't like writing things down, and only a letter or two of his exist, none of them containing anything particularly interesting. Born in [Warrington](https://williamsontunnels.com/history-2/williamsons-story/) (probably) to a family down on their luck, he was likely sent to Liverpool with a letter of recommendation to work for a wealthy tobacco and snuff merchant called Richard Tate. Joseph buckled down and worked hard, married the boss’s daughter Elizabeth when the old man died and bought the business from Richard’s failson, Thomas. He then grew the business considerably, incorporating it into his own company Leigh & Williamson.

Williamson and his wife decided to get out of the big smoke and move to Edge Hill in 1805, and almost immediately Williamson decided to build more houses there, with cellars. And as it turns out, the man really loved cellars. So much so he decided to keep digging them out more. And more. And to join them together. And to dig another level below that one. And why don’t we build a [cool double arch on that ceiling](https://williamsontunnels.com/the-tunnels/gallery/#jp-carousel-483)?  And stick a pointless long tunnel in that one that goes on for ages that you can only get through by crawling. And…

**What? Why?**

Unfortunately, we only have conjecture here, because Joseph Williamson was extremely secretive - probably because what he was doing was very illegal. Also, he was fucking weird. Disappointingly, early theories that he and his wife were in a religious doomsday cult and wanted to shelter from the apocalypse seem to be unlikely. However, doomsday vibes abounded when navvies digging out the Liverpool to Manchester Railway broke through the top of one of the Williamson Tunnels and fled in fear, believing that the shouting and strange shapes below meant they had dug down so deep they had broken their way into hell.

The reasons for the tunnels are more likely to be a combination of pragmatism and good old Protestant work ethic. The houses sat on top of huge amounts of useful and lucrative sandstone, making it likely that Williamson was running a secret quarry away from the eyes of the taxman. The presence of ornate [brick arches](https://williamsontunnels.com/the-tunnels/gallery/#jp-carousel-479) point to this - they don’t just look cool, they stop the rock from caving in on the quarrymen’s heads, allowing them to go deeper. 

The ornate flourishes and odd, pointless nature of some of the additions are believed to be makework. The working class of Liverpool were in a bad way at the time, with many returning from the Napoleonic wars to find no work waiting for them. Williamson didn’t believe in charity - he believed in an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay. Except a lot of the honest work was totally pointless - turning grindstones whether there was anything to grind or not, filling in holes and then emptying them again, and getting really intricate with the brickwork when it was completely unnecessary. Still, it was said that at one time he employed half the working-class men of Edge Hill,  more than anyone else, who no doubt thought that while this was all a bit weird, it sure beat starving to death in the street.

Joseph was not a wife guy. He was married to the job. He swanned off on his wedding day, still wearing his marriage attire, to go hunting, and disliked his wife so much he once deliberately let all the birds out of her aviary. They never had children, and lived separate lives. This detail, along with the frequent hosting of male clergy members in his house has led some (well, just me to be honest) to speculate he could have been gay. Or he could have just been a weird guy who didn’t like women and loved digging massive caverns. He would also obsessively count his wheelbarrows every night and perform petty shit-tests on his friends to make sure they actually liked him. 

‘[On one occasion, Williamson invited a number of friends and well-to-do acquaintances to his house for a meal. He sat them at a ramshackle table and placed in front of them a poor man’s meal of bacon and beans. Most took offence and left. To the remainder he said ‘now I know who my true friends are, follow me…’. He took them through to a banqueting hall and treated them to a feast fit for a King.’](https://williamsontunnels.com/history-2/anecdotes/)

He was probably wasn’t much fun at parties.

There are other bits and pieces floating around about Williamson, but despite the lengthy introduction, this post isn’t actually about him. It’s about the people who have dedicated chunks of their lives to finding out more about him and his tunnels - the mole people of Edge Hill.

**Rediscovering the tunnels**

The tunnels were used as a massive municipal waste dump and unofficial sewer for years after Williamson died, and eventually filled up with rubbish and human waste. Complaints about the smell proliferated, and the authorities blocked them up - until a guy called William Hand went down there in the early 1900s and wrote a [newspaper article about it](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2247147339/permalink/10151652205392340) (you need to be logged in to Facebook to see this one). Still, not much was done to properly rediscover them, until a group of volunteers were overwhelmed with curiosity in the 90s and smashed their way in with some diggers. There, they found some incredible antique artifacts going back to Williamson’s time, but mainly coal byproduct, rubble and endless rubbish, all the way up to the ceiling of 60+ foot deep caverns. Thankfully, the human waste had by that time decomposed. They dug it out by hand for years, filling skip after skip, which they funded by showing people the caverns - the head office of The Friends of the Williamson Tunnels (a portacabin) still has a sign up encouraging people to donate by telling them the price of a skip. United by the desire to uncover the mysteries of Joseph Williamson and find out once and for all just what was in those damn tunnels, the volunteers worked together side by side with one purpose, until the inevitable happened -they fell out over some petty bullshit and split and hated each other forever.

**The People’s Front of Edge Hill**

I imagine if you could get one of the volunteers down the pub from each side they would tell a very different story of what happened, but anyone has ever joined a community group will testify to the pettiness and infighting that plague them. From the outside, The Williamson Tunnels Heritage Centre volunteers (henceforth The Heritagers) are the more professional of the two groups. They own the actual visitor centre, although it’s a bit run down. It sells cheap instant coffee, DVDs and mole ornaments. Their tour is (in this author’s humble opinion) not as good. They allow you access to less of their section of the tunnels, appearing to have a more robust attitude to health and safety, and are content to amble through with you for 40 minutes with a largely scripted tour and call it a day. Still, what you see is [impressive](http://www.williamsontunnels.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/74447424_1410669122434029_1991203295770705920_n.jpeg) \- even more so when you consider what both groups have dug out between them is suspected to only be the tip of the iceberg.

The Friends of Williamson Tunnels (henceforth The Friends) are definitely more ramshackle and have difficulty with time management. Their only [salty review ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/keeu5dcywbT1Wxd2A)claims they have competitions to see who can do the longest tour. Their centre is a portacabin on the ruins of Williamson’s own house 0.2 miles away from the heritage centre, with [2/3rs of just the front of Williamson’s old House precariously propped up by rusted steel beams](https://williamsontunnels.com/the-tunnels/gallery/#jp-carousel-460). Apparently this chunk of wall has been at risk of demolition for years but as the council appear to have forgotten The Friends exist - or prefer to just studiously ignore them - it’s still there. They really, really love digging and talking about digging. Tours can top 3 hours, and if you can get a volunteer off on a tangent they will just keep going, but what they say is always weird and interesting. Their area of the tunnels is much more impressive and includes the [Paddington complex](https://williamsontunnels.com/the-tunnels/gallery/#jp-carousel-2416) which goes 60 feet below ground and looks like an underground cathedral, albeit one they’ve installed metal steps in that you have to pump groundwater out of. The acoustics are incredible. Under Williamson’s House itself there’s a narrow, eerie section called [The Gash](https://williamsontunnels.com/the-tunnels/gallery/#jp-carousel-475) that only skinnier tour members can squeeze through in parts, and the weird tunnel to nowhere that can only be accessed by crawling on your hands and knees. Apparently professional cavers have gone in there but I decided not to.

The two groups split in the early 2000s, and I only have hearsay as to why. There are accusations of unprofessionalism, being in bed with the council, and disruptions during meetings (you have no authority here Jackie Weaver!) The Friends are the ones who split from The Heritagers, which was apparently the work of two of the more cantankerous members wanting to go off and dig more. Those members are no longer involved in either organisation, and apparently tried to split a third time before one of them died. Still, the acrimony continues, with members of the Friends splitting off quite recently to go rejoin the Heritagers.

The Council looms large over both groups, intermittently giving them permission and cheap rents to continue their operations then resolutely ignoring them and never, ever providing a penny of financial support. It was probably this atmosphere of neglect that caused extra frustration in the volunteers, leading them to infight over the best way to handle the sites. At one point the Heritage faction decided to allow the sale of an area of land they didn’t deem of historical interest, as it wasn’t a Williamson building. The Friends disagreed, likely thinking it unwise to give authorities an inch. It turns out they may have been correct on this - more on that later.

Having two groups basically doing the same thing 350 yards from each other is the source of endless confusion, not helped by the fact both of them charge the same amount of money (£5, an amount that doesn’t seem to have been raised since the 90s). The Friends technically do their tours of Paddington for free, but £5 unlocks the bonus content under Williamson’s House. People turn up for the wrong tour constantly. Volunteers complain that they go after grants only to find they have already been given to the rival organisation, and that having two organsations causes confusion when trying to fundraise which hurts both of them. However, after I had already started writing this, news appeared that suggests that the Friends may have ‘won’ the battle - although I doubt either organisation would call this a victory.

**I am never going to financially recover from this**

The Heritagers had been operating on a ‘peppercorn’ rent for 25 years, but earlier today it was announced that the Williamson Tunnels Heritage Site is likely to close. Now their lease is up, and the developers want more money than they can drum up with £5 donations - 275k to buy the site or £20k a year to rent it. For a large inner city site this actually isn’t very much at all, but apparently UK organisations like English Heritage who have money don’t want to know about it - possible due to all the weird infighting and the occasional quasi-legal digs of the various groups, plus the difficulties in getting underground complexes listed. This would of course stop tours at that site, and they would quickly fall into disrepair - and future digs, and more areas discovered, will be off the table

This is a huge blow, not just for The Heritagers but for Liverpool. It cannot be understated how cool these underground complexes are - and only somee of them have been discovered. In a sane world, these would be operated by professionals and turned into a massive tourist attraction. People on tours are always baffled as to why something so unique, impressive and just downright fucking weird is only operated on Wednesdays and Sundays out of a portacabin with no signage. With the right attention, this could be a legitimate draw for tourism - but right now, even many people living in Liverpool haven’t heard about these tunnels, let alone the feuding. Closing down the heritage centre seems to be the first step in building yet more student flats over the entire area and filling it up with rubbish all over again - there’s nothing legally preventing anyone from doing so.

Maybe one day, when I’m mad and retired, I will choose whichever Williamson group is still operating and begin to dig out the fresh drifts of rubbish, rediscovering the tunnels all over again. I will make deep, lasting friendships with my comrades in rubble, and we will vow never to let our city’s heritage be lost to greedy developers and council inaction ever again. Then I’ll fall out with a load of them over a misunderstanding and slope off to another part of Edge Hill to dig it out by hand alone. In the meantime, it’s very likely the tunnels could be partially lost very soon, and the future for the rest of them looks shaky. But they’ve stood since the early 1800s. It will take more than filling them with discarded beer cans, empty Rustlers Burgers boxes and Funko Pops from the student halls above to destroy them. They’ll be back one day - but in the meantime we're all left much poorer for their absence.

The Heritagers have a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/adcnrn-save-the-heritage-centre) here to keep their centre and tunnels open.

Their website can be found [here](http://www.williamsontunnels.co.uk/). You can still go on their tour until this Sunday, so if you're local and you've been on the fence about it now's the time.

The website for the totally different organisation, Friends of Williamson Tunnels (with much better pictures) can be found [here](https://williamsontunnels.com/). You can still go on tours with them - and if you're ever in Liverpool, do! Just make sure you set aside a few hours for it.

Williamson Tunnels Edge Hill, operated by The Heritagers, has loads of cool primary sources in the files section. That's [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2247147339).

I also used some material from Underground Liverpool by local historian Jim Moore - mainly the stuff about Williamson's crap relationship wth his wife. It's out of print but second hand copies are [cheap](https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/91721478).

1kw9k5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1kw9k5l/i_intentionally_took_2_gap_years_after_college/,I intentionally took 2 gap years after college and slightly regret it after realizing that I have more free-time than you think in medical school,"Disclaimer: part of the reason is because I took my gap years during COVID so a lot of plans to travel and have fun were shut down

im a US MD recently graduated M4. I graduated college in 2019. I was ready to apply to medical school to potentially start right after college or a year after college (assuming I was accepted) but chose to forego that and take a full year off after college to work, travel, and relax because I thought that once I start medical school and residency, I won't have any free-time to lounge around and relax.

Well, now that I finished med school, I realize how untrue this was and I wish I started medical school right after college because I would be 2 years younger when I start attending-hood (the specialty I want to go into will be 6 years long if you include fellowship).

So don't get me wrong, medical school is not easy. There are periods of time where all you do is literally sleep and study. While medical school is certainly demanding—there are periods where studying and clinical rotations consume nearly all your time—there are also surprising stretches of flexibility. The structure of most modern med school curriculums, especially pass/fail pre-clinical years and online, non-mandatory lectures, allows for more personal time than many expect.

For example, our school's microbiology course was a breeze because all we used were 3rd party materials like Sketchy micro. We all aced our exams and probably went out to the gym, the park, dinner, movies, etc. with friends multiple times a week.

When exams are over, the whole class is often free at once, creating built-in social time that’s hard to coordinate in most adult working lives. By contrast, recent college grads working entry-level jobs or go into fields like law, finance, or consulting often deal with long commutes, rigid schedules, and unpredictable hours. Ironically, med students often end up with *more* flexibility to enjoy birthdays, travel, or a spontaneous night out—especially in the early years.

Our lectures weren't mandatory and they were recorded online. Partied too hard on Thursday night for a friend's birthday? No problem, just sleep in the next day and then watch lectures on 2x speed. Don't feel like attending Friday lectures? Go party all day and then make it up on Saturday afternoon at a coffee shop with your buddies.

M4 year is a total joke. I applied to a competitive specialty and I still had a ton of free time. My friends who applied to non-competitive specialties that didn't require away rotations had double the free-time I had. Exam scores don't even matter because our residency apps were submitted and we already got our Step 2 scores. Using the credit card points and money I accrued during my gap year jobs allowed me to travel to 3 different countries DURING medical school while doing online electives for graduation credits. I literally received 4 units of graduation credits in August of 2024 while on vacation in Tokyo because elective was online and the modules took a maximum of 1 hour.

And now after graduation, I'm just counting down the days until I start residency in July. I've been staying up till 3 AM playing games and watching Netflix and waking up at noon because I can. I've attended 3 different weddings, all in different parts of the US because I planned ahead of time.

Of course, this isn’t to say that medical training is easy. Residency is a grind, and there are sacrifices. But so is life for many friends outside of medicine. People in other fields who make high salaries typically put in long hours to get there. There’s no shortcut to success, regardless of the path.

My life did not feel like it stopped or that I'm ""4 years behind"" my friends because I went to medical school. If anything, I feel like I've been able to have more fun than some people I know who worked 9-5s or went to grad school. I've dated in med school, I've had friends who got married in med school and bought a house. TONS of medical students and residents go to music concerts, Coachella, etc. It's possible.

Is it going to be possible to lounge around and sleep in every single week? No. But neither do 99% of your working friends.

Not saying gap years are a bad idea or that you *have* to rush through med school just to start making money sooner—that's not the takeaway. The point is, if you’re stressing that starting med school means saying goodbye to vacations, weddings, birthdays, and having a life in general... that’s just not the case. With some planning and smart prioritization, you can absolutely make time for all of that.

I wish I just started med school when I had my application ready, especially because all the ""fun"" I could've had in my gap years were ruined cuz of COVID. But now that I'm on the other side, I feel like I've had a ton of fun over the years and traveled way more than I ever have in my life.

The takeaway? Medical school isn’t a prison sentence. It’s hard, but thousands of students do it every year —and with the right mindset and planning, there’s time to travel, celebrate milestones, date, go to concerts, and live life. Don’t let the fear of losing all your free time be the reason you delay your path or that you have to ""use up your 20s now before signing away your life in medical school"". Life doesn’t stop in med school. In many ways, it finally starts to take shape.

The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Monday now, the coffee chat was on Wednesday of last week). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

1kw9i20,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1kw9i20/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — haven't heard back in almost 1 week.,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Monday now, the coffee chat was on Wednesday of last week). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

**I** sent her a thank you email the day of the coffee chat. ",2,1748304275.0,interviews,1,1.0,False

I am not looking for a really long term conversation cause based on my experience, its kinda impossible, or if not, really hard to find. 

I am ok with short and not forced convesation and playful banter on the side, cause who doesn't like a good humour? 😁

I also understand that life can be busy so no pressure to reply fast all the time. I do sometimes take a while to get back😅.

They were as far as I know not actually royalty, but I referred to them as such once and it made them so happy that I always referred to them as such any time they came in.

As before, this was pre-pandemic in 2019.
They were at least in their 80s and may possibly have had dementia in the very early stages. They always had a sandwich and some coffee and would sit there for two hours every Saturday. Never caused any trouble, but it was slightly annoying because technically they were only supposed to be there for like a half hour or so, but we didn’t want to upset them so we just let them stay.

Normally, once I saw that people were done with their tray, I would go and offer to remove it, but they always were saying that they were still using it but one time they got up to go to the bathroom and I simply took the tray for them since I knew they’d already had the sandwich and coffee and weren’t going to be buying anything else. When they came back, the lady was very upset and asked why would you do such a thing. I replied “I thought I’d make things easier on you.” “well we weren’t done with it. don’t do that again.” well OK you’re the boss. Considering they were so upset by it I just let them take it back for the rest of the time they come in.

One other story, I will share about them. I was doing my rounds in the dining room and I happen to look up and notice their car pull in.
I made a note of that figuring that they walk in but around a half hour later they hadn’t walked in. I walked over to the door and noticed that they still in the car with their heads tipped back and so still I feel they were dead, so I went to get my general manager to check on them. Fortunately, she noticed them breathing and told me they had fallen asleep. They came in a bit later stayed for two hours and then left like nothing happened me and my coworkers speculated how on earth the husband still had a drivers license considering he fell asleep like that after arriving at the restaurant.

Once Covid happened in the lockdown started, we didn’t see them again until after the dining room opened back up, and the husband came in once and if I remember correctly, his wife had died and he was going to go into a nursing home",5,1748304212.0,TalesFromYourServer,1,0.78,False

we ended up working out together for a bit and he made me laugh. when i was done, i said bye and didn’t think much of it. but then i saw him again while i was sitting in the cafe area, scrolling my phone. he walked over, sat next to me, and we talked for like an hour. it felt easy. like i didn’t have to try so hard to sound interesting or be “cute enough” or whatever.

before we left, he asked if i wanted to grab a coffee at a place nearby. i was caught off guard but i said yes. we sat and talked for another hour, and he asked for my number before we left. i gave it to him. and now i’m just… spinning a bit. i’ve never been on a real date. never held hands with someone. never kissed anyone. and i don’t really know what i’m doing or what he might expect from me.

Why can't we write properly?,"I need to rant but the problem is everywhere. I am ashamed to explain to elementary school kids that the person who wrote the question is unfortunately illiterate, and you need to learn when to ignore what the question asks and instead interpret the intent behind it. (But sometimes you dont, and it's an intended trick!)

Why do we tolerate math problems being written so poorly that we can't tell the right answer?

Example from earlier today: *All light bulbs in an office were placed into 4 boxes. The first box when divided by 5, the second box when divided by 4, the third box when divided by 3 and the fourth box when divided by 6 resulted in the same whole number. What is the least of number of light bulbs that could have been in the office?* The original question is about coffee mugs, but its worded exactly the same.

Let's break it down:

**The first box when divided by 5 resulted in a whole number.** 

A box divided by 5 will never result in a whole number since it's a single box - it will result in 1/5 of a box. Unsolvable. QED. (also, dividing a box has no relation to light bulbs)

How about we use a proper writing? 

**The number of light bulbs in the first box when divided by 5 resulted in a whole number.** 

Now let's change **""all light bulbs""** to **""several light bulbs""** and zero answer is no longer feasible. 

If you change **boxes** to **shelves** \- the solution of putting boxes into other boxes goes away and we have a proper question. With a single, clear, correct answer.

You see plenty of posts on here that look like mine does while it’s fermenting, big pockets of whey and separated curds. I figured I’d give the labneh thing a try.

There are instructions online, but basically once you’ve got your grains safely out, you stick the kefir in a mesh strainer lined with a coffee filter or reusable cheesecloth and let it separate overnight. Lots can be done with that whey, so I separated mine into a bowl in the fridge. Salted to taste. Mine came out almost exactly like Boursin in texture and mildness, which was surprising given how tart the kefir was before separating. I tried the whey. Zap! That’s where all that tartness went.

I read somewhere that you can use whey to kickstart a winter-dormant composter, so I put the zapper there, we’ll see if it works.

Top toastie has kefir labneh and torshi seer, bottom one has labneh and honey, it’s equally good savory or sweet. I think I’ll do the next batch with chopped chives or see if I can make a Boursin dupe.

Everything was perfect… except he forgot one small detail: pants.

“No one will see below the waist,” Jake thought confidently.

The meeting began. Jake was killing it—sharing charts, smiling, nodding, making awkward corporate jokes. But then, disaster struck.

His cat, Sir Meowington, leapt onto the desk mid-presentation, knocking over Jake’s full coffee mug. In a panic, Jake jumped up to grab paper towels—revealing to the entire Zoom team that he was wearing a banana costume from Halloween. Just... no explanation. Bright yellow, full peel, even had a little stem hat.

He froze. They froze. Then his boss unmuted and said, “Well… potassium is important for productivity.”

Jake is now known across the company as Banana Jake. He leaned into it. His Slack icon is a banana. His email signature includes a banana emoji. And every Friday, he actually wears the costume to meetings.

1kw937z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kw937z/the_man_who_love_bombed_me_dumped_me_over/,The man who love bombed me dumped me over mouthwash,"I (26F) met Donny (30M) on Bumble a few months ago, and things moved fast — mostly because he was the one pushing for it.

Our first date was dinner and a spontaneous comedy show. It was fun, but I was still keeping my options open.

Second date, he made me steak and potatoes at his place and then took me to a live music event. He later told me he had *never* made anyone dinner on a second date before and called it the best date of his life. At the time, I wasn’t feeling a strong physical connection, and I considered backing off, but we kept texting daily. He was away for work, and I was on a trip, so we didn’t see each other again for almost a month.

On our third date, he wanted to take me to a fancy dinner for my (late) birthday, but I said that was too much, so we kept it casual. I ended up spending the night for the first time, and something shifted. He was coming across as emotionally available and genuinely interested in me. My feelings started to change.

A few days later, we met for coffee, and he told me he wanted us to be exclusive. That was technically only our fourth date. I told him I wasn’t ready yet but wanted to keep seeing him and see where it went. He said he was fine with that and willing to wait.

Throughout April, we kept getting closer. I stopped seeing the only other person I’d been dating casually and focused on Donny. He made significantly more money than me and would regularly pay for meals, drinks, Ubers, etc., which I appreciated. He kept making comments about wanting a relationship but always said he understood that I needed to take things slow. I had been burned before and was trying not to rush anything.

At the end of April, I felt ready, and we made things official. We were boyfriend and girlfriend.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my graduation family dinner. I even told him he didn’t have to come — he insisted on joining. He met my whole family. It seemed to go well.

After making things official, I started noticing things that gave me pause. I began to feel unheard, talked over, and generally dismissed. He made comments like “I like to spend money like an asshole.” He would throw away six to eight plastic water bottles a day without recycling. He often spoke poorly about friends he claimed were close. His entire lifestyle seemed focused on maximizing convenience — and that started to show in how he handled the relationship too. I was commuting two hours from outside the city to see him (and for work/friends), and he never once came to me.

Then, completely out of nowhere, he sent me a text saying my *hygiene habits* were a “showstopper” for him, and he was feeling “overwhelmed by the pace” of our relationship and wanted to take a step back.

This was confusing on multiple levels.

1. **He set the pace.** He was the one who pushed for exclusivity, pushed for official status, gave me a key to his apartment, invited me to a wedding at the end of the year, and made future plans.
2. **I gave him outs.** When I stayed over three nights in a row (which was a first), I told him I could stay with a friend one night — he told me not to. When I invited him to my family dinner, I said he didn’t have to come — he insisted.
3. **The “hygiene” thing came out of nowhere.** For context: he showers and uses mouthwash multiple times a day. I typically shower every other day (but also sometimes daily) and have never in my life once been told I smell, have bad breath, or am unhygienic. He had bought mouthwash for me to keep at his place, and I thought it was a sweet gesture at the time — not a sign of judgment.

After he sent the breakup text, I called him, and we talked for 30 minutes. He said his “OCD” made my hygiene habits difficult for him. He also said, “I know I’m very difficult to be with” and admitted the breakup was “90% his fault.”

A week before all this, I had met his parents. We had made future plans. I was starting to settle into the relationship. I thought he was genuine when he told me I deserved to be treated well and that he could see I hadn’t been in the past.

Now, looking back, all those words feel empty. It feels like the rug was pulled out from under me.

I’ve never felt so confused and caught off guard. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

**TL;DR:**  
Started dating someone who pushed for commitment early, gave me a key, met my family, and said all the right things. A month into being official, he dumped me via text over my “hygiene” (despite them falling well within normal habits). He later admitted he has ""OCD"" and said it was mostly his fault. For reference, I am a mental health therapist and know he does not have clinical OCD. Feeling incredibly blindsided and hurt.",0,1748303057.0,BreakUps,0,0.5,False
1kw92of,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kw92of,Tasting: Hydrangea - Luna Bermudez,"Roaster & Coffee Details
	•	Roaster: Hydrangea Coffee Roasters
	•	Location: Berkeley, California
	•	Coffee Name: Luna Bermudez
	•	Origin: El Paraiso, Cauca, Colombia
	•	Producer: Samuel Diego Bermudez
	•	Varietal: Gesha
	•	Elevation: 1930 masl
	•	Process: Double Fermentation Thermal Shock

Process Overview:
This Gesha variety was produced at Finca El Paraiso using an advanced double fermentation process. The coffee undergoes anaerobic fermentation in both cherry and pulped stages, utilizing a Gesha yeast culture. Post-fermentation, the beans are sealed and washed with a thermal shock technique to lock in aromatic precursors and enhance clarity. This meticulous process is designed to maximize complexity and highlight the coffee’s natural aromatics.

Flavor Profile (From roaster):
	•	Egg Waffle
	•	Blueberry
	•	High Mountain Oolong Tea
	•	Body: Silky
	•	Acidity: Brilliant (according to roaster), though see my tasting notes below. 

Taster’s Notes:
First sip was very light but earthy, distinct wet wood flavors of Oolong with a mild sweetness. More tea than coffee, silky mouthfeel that’s easy to sip. Short finish, low acidity and slightly grassy/underdeveloped.

Visual & Presentation:
The beans are on the small-medium size, and show the light roast level. Whole bean and ground bean aromas were grassy and Oolong forward. Extracted coffee presented as very light, almost orange.  

Summary & Evaluation
Hydrangea Coffee Roasters’ Luna Bermudez Gesha is a highly nuanced, experimental Colombian coffee. The double fermentation thermal shock process delivers a cup that is delicate, tea-like, and silky, with flavors reminiscent of egg waffle, blueberry, and high mountain oolong tea. The tasting experience leans toward subtlety, with low acidity, a short finish, and an earthy, slightly grassy undertone. This profile will appeal to those who appreciate refined, lightly roasted coffees with complex processing and a gentle, contemplative cup character.

1kw90os,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1kw90os/my_tips_as_a_firsttimer/,My tips as a first-timer,"Last day here. We read TONS of guides most of which come from “experts”. Here are some things we wish we had known as first time visitors. 

The meal plan thing is annoying. Counter service vs snacks vs sit down etc. I have no idea how much if any money it saves but trying to figure this thing out, it took until the second day and even then I didn’t care for it. But I just want to order a coffee not decide “if it’s a snack” or whatever. We got to where we would just say we are paying with a card then at the end of the meal let them charge whatever they can to the plan. Would not do the meal plan again. The expert style guides aren’t joking about reserving sit down tables months in advance. Thankfully we did this but saw lots of very upset people who couldn’t find sit down places to eat. 

We brought phone backup batteries but test them before the trip. We had a 5000mah battery that should’ve been plenty but it would overheat on magnetic charging so we needed a cable. An anker 10k mah was overkill but the mag charge worked better. For us with two phones the 5000mah was plenty of extra juice. 

The Disney magic bands make no sense for us - with kids, getting everyone to scan. It was faster as a family to have a parent with the passes on the wallet and swipe and scan versus corralling the kids and their magic bands. You really need a phone for maps and it was faster and easier to use the Apple wallet tickets on the same phone for lightning passes and park passes. We would bring one magic band for photos. FYI there is a special way to add park passes to Apple wallet - worth doing it. 

So I live in a suburb but where I live people know how to walk in groups. This is not the case at Disney. People will suddenly stop in the middle of walkways to look at their map or whatever causing traffic pile ups. People will walk in family groups very slowly blocking paths. Basically be very mentally prepared for sort of clueless group behaviour and complete lack of spatial awareness. It was fine it’s Disney and vacation but it was worse than I would’ve thought. 

The ratio of motorized chair scooters per person is insane. Tons of these things and they are FAST and do not yield to people walking. We saw a little girl get absolutely creamed by someone blasting through the park. She was knocked at least 6-7’ straight off her feet and thank god didn’t get run over, she could’ve been killed - but was banged up pretty bad. The woman who rammed into her claimed the scooter took off on its own (wrong, this woman was driving like a maniac before she ran over the child). Be aware that the scooters are heavy, plus a 300-350lb person you’re talking a LOT of force if they run into you. They have a fast mode and slow mode, fast mode is very fast in forward and reverse. We also saw someone get smushed on the bus when someone reversed in “fast mode” and lost control. 

We stayed at wilderness lodge and had a fantastic time. Next time we will stay somewhere with monorail access but taking the boat to magic kingdom was fun. ",33,1748302849.0,WaltDisneyWorld,18,0.85,False

I previously had symptoms of BED for years, so my doctor decided to change my psych medication (for a different mental health problem) from one that increased appetite (as a side effect) to one that doesn’t affect appetite. This was because the weight gain was related to the first medication.

I have noticed a significant reduction in my appetite and because I am clinically overweight I thought this was okay, but now I am getting symptoms of nutrient deficiencies.

BUT I am still ignoring hunger cues. It’s weird because I have no problem with palatable foods like sweet foods etc (even then I don’t eat loads). I know the nutrient deficiencies are bad for me (I’m now getting dark circles, super tired, some under-eye wrinkles, less fit than usual) but I’m fixated on my weight to the point where I care more about that than my overall health. 

I guess I am justifying this weight loss because I imagine the average person would view it as a positive, but because of my history I’m worried that I’m slipping towards something else. I know that this is a bad way go go about weight loss and that I should be having nutrients and regular meals instead, but it’s just so much easier for me to ignore hunger and then just have a chocolate bar or a coffee to tide myself over.

I think I should preface first with; I have joint instability and chronic pain/fatigue as a result. This impairs me a decent bit but I try to work through it regardless.
Unfortunately as an opener drive thru cashier I am also expected to do a Lot of extra things, and it's 3 hours of nonstop running back and forth across the store trying to both get supplies and reach the POS quick enough to take orders. It really depends on the manager and how they're feeling on if it'll be reasonable or stuff like filling the iced coffee?? That's across the store from where I'm supposed to be? 

Needless to say this has begun to really wear me down and cause a lot of pain. I feel as if my body is breaking down quicker doing all this. I don't have the ability to get any sort of doctor's note due to the complexity of my condition and lack of insurance, but I need to get Something changed.

I'm also frequently getting blamed for things and lectured by a rotation of managers even if it was not me who did something or I had a good reason; leading me to frequently have to try and explain myself to deaf ears. 
And all this while an almost nonstop stream of customers comes through my lane DX 
This shift is just driving me crazy and I've felt like I either don't work hard enough or am just too weak for it. Like c'mon it's McDonald's and I'm perfectly intelligent, but idk not enough.

Future Mate,

I’m a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who’s also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I’m talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I’ve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something’s missing... a mate who’s down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some “life unpacking” over coffee or a fire pit.

What I’m not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

I'd love to share some selfies, talk about deal breakers first up to avoid wasting each other's time and fast tracking if we have the potential to connect even.

Cheers,

1kw8rki,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1kw8rki/met_my_roommate_for_the_first_time_he_was_wearing/,Met my roommate for the first time. He was wearing my clothes.,"I (23M) moved into an apartment on May 1st. Super cheap, super small. Super gross. The apartment consists of one long hallway with every room on the left side. The person who sublet me the room told me that people generally stay in their rooms and keep to themselves. I found this to be true, especially since I have now lived there for almost a full month and barely see any of them. 

I get a text last night in the apartment group chat from one of my roommates that I haven’t even seen in person yet asking to be let in the front door as he forgot his keys. I agree to let him in. 

I walk to the front door and there he is. He had just gotten back from a trip, and was holding a roller suitcase. As I open the door I realize the shirt he has on is the same one I lost about a week earlier. Not a generic shirt either. A very specific T shirt from a niche coffee shop that I frequented while living at my old apartment. 

I ask “where’d you get that shirt?” He replies with a mumbled “I don’t know. I just found it and thought it was my sisters boyfriends.” I also spot that he’s wearing the shorts I lost as well. 

This makes me really weirded out for a couple reasons:

1. I NEVER leave my clothes anywhere outside my room. The apartment is gross. The bathroom is nasty. When I shower, I walk to and from the bathroom wearing my towel. Those clothes have never been outside my room unless I’m wearing them. 

2. I haven’t done laundry since I moved in. (I know I really need to) There is no chance of getting them mixed up in the washer and dryer. This is especially true as there isn’t even laundry in the building. 

3. When I toured the apartment, the sub-letter made a pretty big deal about the fact that my bedroom door can be locked from the outside with my key. I didn’t really feel like I would need to do that, but now him saying that makes me feel like he knew I would need to. 

4. This guy seems… off. He barely makes eye contact, cannot hold a conversation, and gives me a freaky vibe. He acts so guilty.


The only logical conclusion I have for him wearing my clothes is that he snuck into my room while I was out and took it out of my drawer. I have no other explanation. 

I asked him today to give me the clothes back, and he said he would when he gets back to the apartment. Now he’s saying that he accidentally took them to the laundromat, and I’m going to have to wait a while to get them back. 

Why the fuck does this guy want my clothes so bad? I’m freaked the fuck out. Help.

I shared my before and after that I had shared as a comment previously, and I mentioned it was really hard to share the before, but I got the most amazing positive comments about how we are all in this together. So thank you. 

I started 1/19/2024 and I haven’t missed a workout since that date, I haven’t ordered food delivery since that date, and I went to a completely whole foods diet, counted calories and stayed in a calorie deficit until recently. I’ve been maintaining between 100-102lbs for 4 months. I’ve spent most of my time on 12.5. I average 20-25k steps a day. 

I’ve lost 55% of my body weight in 13 months. I’ve gone from a size 24 to a 00. My A1C went from 13.7 to 4.9. I’m 56, T2D, post-menopausal, have hypothyroidism and battled PCOS from my early 20s. 

I feel like I would be a slow responder. I’ve had very little suppression of appetite and food noise. I’ve had zero bad side effects. Therefore, with the metabolic help that MJ provides, I’ve learned healthy ways to deal with hunger and food noise. I took control and made it happen. 

What I learned? Drink more water than you thought possible, snack on fruit, coffee, or go exercise to help with appetite. I eat 30-35 different varieties of veggies every day, often at each meal. I cook all but 1 or 2 meals a week. Stay away from restaurant food, especially if you want to count calories. Buy a food scale. Use it for pasta, rice and protein. 

I’ve never had a stall because I’ve been so consistent and disciplined, but that’s just my personality. This last pound was hard fought but I was really in maintenance, so I wasn’t putting a lot of effort in to it. Give yourself some grace. We all handle things differently and life happens.

1kw8o54,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1kw8o54/i_cant_stand_her/,I can't stand her,"so I recently moved into a 5 bedroom house and got 4 roommates, 2 of them are foreign and gone back to their countries to visit for a few weeks, leaving only 3 ppl in the house, me and two other.


I've been having issues with this girl, older than me, who wants to come off as nice but is insufferable. She's closer to other roommates than she is with me, and has had issues for grabbing things, especially food, that's not hers. I can't confirm any of my suspects, but I do have them: I found both my shampoo and soap In different positions, and also my coffee. 

We each have our storage space in the kitchen, and I keep my coffee in my room bc I've got a coffee machine. Recently I left it in the kitchen, in my section, covered by a packet of crackers, only to find the crackers moved and the coffee in sight.

It's the end of the month and money is tight, and I think she's quit her job.

I bought dish soap two times, one my other roommates offered to pay (not her), the next I said no worries, that they could care for the next, and now we've run out and she leaves her dishes in the sink, and has yet to offer to buy one.

She's got a delicate mental state, last week she only asked if I was around because she wanted to talk to someone. I told her I was busy, because honestly she usually does speak with other roommates but I've got enough going on for me with college, and while I understand mental health can be difficult, I don't have to take responsibility for hers, nor do I want to spend my afternoon hearing trauma dumping.

Today she said she had a fever and asked me to go buy her medicine for it, I was in a class by the time so I said no. Then she asked again later, meaning she spent all day inside without a single way to fix her own issues. I'm sick of it.",4,1748301843.0,badroommates,0,0.75,False

His influence helped turn the Sazerac—from a barroom staple into a legendary drink—and rye whiskey was always at its core.

Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye is a tribute to that bold legacy. Uncut, unfiltered, and bottled straight from the barrel, this expression from the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection was released in 2023.

Everything seemed so goddamn mediocre. I was supposed to be enthralled by all aspects of the MC life, but really, who could blame me for being bored? I'd been the head of this club for fifteen years and every day it was the same thing. Being President, I dealt with the business and recruiting. It was boring work and I missed being a muscle. Don't get me wrong, I loved being the Prez. I loved leading my guys into better times than my dad ever did. Above all, I was a natural protector. I stood by my brothers through thick and thin, but more importantly to me, I protected the biker girls and old ladies. All life experience shaped and influenced people. Mine told me that the women in the club took a lot of fucking shit, and they needed someone looking out for them. All clubs' rules differed and the San Jose Black Stallions were no different. The way we were unique was that I had my Scared Law. What was Sacred Law? No one and I mean no one was allowed to ever hurt my girls. That was the easiest way to get on my worst side. My mom had been club property and I would never desire the atrocities I saw happen to her on anyone, not my worst goddamn enemy. I sure as hell didn't want any of the bitches that took care of me and my guys to be hurt the way my mom had been.

It used to be that those discolored walls, abused, peeling linoleum floors, and busted up tables would bring me excitement and pump me up for whatever was coming next, but I just couldn't bring myself there. I hated to admit it, but the slump started when Annie dumped my ass for her side piece, a year ago.

""Annie"" or Keyanna Sinclair and I had a nice thing for a bit. Sex was great. She was sweet, funny, charismatic, and very understanding. What was there not to like? Annie wasn't a Black Stallions girl, just a normal woman I met in a bar that liked me. She didn't know anything about me, my chapter, or my lifestyle which made things simple. She knew I was a biker, but didn't know if I was a weekend warrior or what. Then, one day I was pumped from some club shit that went down and spilled to her. She had done her research by this time and knew exactly who I was, what I did, but we didn't talk about it. She didn't seem upset or bothered by the things I told her other than it involved people she knew. Her best friend, indirectly.

We didn't mention it again until the day she broke up with me. She said she couldn't handle the crimes on my hands, worrying it would come back on her. I wasn't fooled. It had nothing to do with me. Annie had never been scared of me before, but she was then. She was sweating and her pupils dilated with intense terror. She was breaking things off with me because her high school sweetheart had come back to town for her best friend's wedding, and she acted like I was going to kill her. Sure, that was generally how things in our circumstance would've gone down, but I wasn't stupid. I wasn't going to do that in front of other people. She would be ""dealt with"" and then the cleaners would come in. It would be like she skipped town and no one would bat an eye at it.

That wasn't how things ended up though. Annie made sure of that after I shot her honey. She said she had recorded everything I ever told her, which wasn't a hell of a lot. In the event of her or her dude's death, it would be sent to the police, so I was stuck, sitting on my fucking hands.

A lot of my crew broke off after that. They thought I had lost my nerve, that I was going soft, but I wasn't going to risk our club over some scorned lover bullshit. Keyanna Sinclair and Zane Taylor could have their happily ever after but if she talked, they would both be disposed of.

Annie was thirty when we dated. Since her, I made a rule for myself not to get involved with a woman younger than forty.

I tried convincing my little brother, Austin, to join up so day-to-day would be a bit more entertaining, but he refused. He was too busy with a band as head of security. I couldn't really blame him. He made a great living and Bruce Mayes was a great guy. Hook was his club name, but he pretty much just partied with us. His wife, Sally, was amazing. Don't get me started on their adorable kids, Jesse and Jessa. Sure, they were just babies, but they had their father's talent for commanding a room with a toothy smile and adorable laugh.

Now, I was stranded with my gang and every day blended together. Not all of it was bad. I got my choice of the Black Stallions girls to take to bed every night, but there was only so much time they could preoccupy. After doing the same shit for so long, things became boring and mundane.

My club, sex, drugs, none of it interested me.

As I took a swig from my beer bottle and I slammed the bottle onto the table, a wooden shard broke off the side of the table-top like almost every time I did that. I needed to stop or I would need to actually buy a new one. I hadn't done that in ten years. I heard the distinct sound of the creaky, rusted out hinges of the door. I turned and saw my old friend, Hook, walk in. Usually, I had to go to check up on him. He rarely came to the clubhouse. Even more surprising was the smoking hot babe that strolled in behind.

She had long, dark chocolate hair that bounced around her shoulders, like dark water roiling against sand. Sun kissed skin of a biker looked so natural with her olive undertones. Light freckling spilled across her face and trickled down her cleavage. Those bright blue eyes reminded me of the crystal clear ocean hitting the surf. She couldn't have been older than twenty-five. Tits were nearly bursting out of her tight tank top and her plump ass was form-fit to that tight leather skirt. Her toned legs were on full display between the short hem of her skirt and the top of her black high heel boots. She wore a weathered denim jacket that was big on her, a man's jacket. Fuck, she was a damn vision, that vision like a young Megan Fox.

Fuck, she was hot with an ""I don't give a Fuck"" attitude. It was drawing me in. Too bad I had sworn off girls that young. I was forty-five. I need a woman with experience in the bedroom and in life. It didn't mean I wasn't enjoying the show.

She jumped a bit as Domino strolled in behind her, the door creaking angrily, the melody of loud engines outside rolled like thunder through the air. She was squinting from the thick smoke in the air and the dimmed, weak lights. Her phone dropped out of her hand and clattered with the dusty linoleum. She spun around, giving me a full view of the back of her jacket. Her ass was magnificent, but it was the patch that caught my attention.

Black Stallions

Sydney, AS

Est. 1981

She was a fuckin ol' lady? Unlikely. I had been studying her from the moment she sauntered through the door, and she didn't carry herself like a kept woman. She strutted like a model without the whole conceitedness. She knew she was drop dead gorgeous, but didn't overly flaunt it. She probably didn't pick that outfit to make every man in the room stare, but that was inevitable. Even if she was wearing a potato sack, I doubt any fewer eyes would be watching her.

All eyes were on her once everyone caught a glimpse. Hell, it took some huge-titted, naked bitch trying her damnedest to get my dick up and usually, it took more than one. My dick was a rock, and she hadn't so much as batted a thick lash my way yet. I was intrigued, salivating, and eager to find out who she was, what she was doing in my clubhouse.

She righted herself and her eyes moved to Hook quizzically before he said something to her.

""Hey, Hook!"" I called at him. He turned, a big grin on his face. A gritty hand on the small of her leather skirt, he guided her through the crowd toward me.

I was a bit curious about this ""woman."" Sure, I had the agreement with myself to stop being with girls instead of women. She was too young. My cut off age was forty and yet, I couldn't help wondering why the hell she showed up at my public clubhouse.

There was only one reason anyone brought a female into the clubhouse. It was one of the simple needs of the male species. To bang. Women drifted to us bikers, to pledge themselves to the Black Stallions as our whores to do whatever we wanted to. I doubted that was why Hook led this girl through our rickety door. I couldn't deny a man could Fuck other women behind his wife's back, but Hook wasn't like that. He had been all about Sally since he met her, and he was not looking at this girl with anything other than protection and concern. Women always threw themselves at him even with it being widely known that he was hitched. Hook had more pussy at his feet than Johnny Wade ever did.

But, what made me even more curious, the female didn't look at him with any type of interest, more like he was a means to an end. Someone doing her a favor.

Who are you, sexy bitch?

""Hey, Brother."" I gave Bruce a hug and noticed the girl perched on a bar stool by him, back straight with confidence. She didn't seem worried about where she was. Strange.

This girl did not look scared at all. You would think she was sitting in a restaurant instead of a clubhouse. She had the commanding presence of a Dominatrix and the allure of a siren to sailors. She was something special. That was for sure.

""Hey, who's the broad?"" I probed, and he glanced at her over his shoulder. We walked a few feet away as she sat there, taking in her surroundings. Her body relaxed the more she looked around at my rough crowd and took in the stank emitted in the air. It was a mixture of booze, smoke, and sweat. I had gotten used to it a long time ago. Maybe she hadn't been around it before, but she didn't seem bothered by it.

""She's one of my band mate's cousins. You know Liam. She moved in with him a few days ago from Australia."" I slowly nodded. Sounded simple enough but it left me with more questions than he answered.

""What is she doing here? You know the rule about girls who enter the clubhouse, man."" I cocked an eyebrow at him, and he chuckled. My rules were pretty simple. Don't bring a bitch to the clubhouse unless she was Black Stallion's property. Only club property, den mothers, and house mouses were allowed past the threshold. End of story.

""She's a Bred In, Gunner."" That was surprising. Why had I never seen her before? I was sure I wouldn't forget a beauty like her. Bred In was the term for the daughter of a member. It was a title to state that they were untouchable. How could she be a Bred In if she moved here recently? Was her Pops from the area? Did she come here from living with her mother or college or whatever she was doing? The original Black Stallions had their chapter in Australia. Was that where she was a Bred In? Well, it explained how comfortable she was in the clubhouse.

""A Bred In? From whom?"" I asked immediately.

""She's a big girl. She can handle herself with bikers. She may look sweet, but that girl can be scary. Her name is Jenny Saunders. Her dad was the founding father."" Holy Fuck! I didn't know whether to be frightened or impressed.

""Trapper is her dad?"" Bruce slowly nodded. Trapper was a fucking legend in the biker community. If you didn't know who he was, you learned fast. I met him once years ago. We had a meeting when my chapter split off from his. It was amicable but that man even scared me. Trapper was psychotic. I wasn't under the disillusion that bikers like me and Trapper weren't insane to an extent but Trapper took it to a new level. He told me a drunken story about chopping off the dick of any asshole he heard about screwing his daughter. Fuck, was this the same daughter he was talking about?

""Was. He was killed three weeks ago, and she ran here to Liam. He named her his heiress and some of his officers were not happy at being run by a woman."" Wow. Trapper was dead? How did I not hear about this until now? It was usually big news when one of the top five in a chapter died. That kind of news spread like wildfire even this far away.

Naming a female as the next president of a chapter was one of the best ways to insight a war between chapters. The most vicious clubs could be broken down by putting a female in a place of power. That was the deal in an outlaw club. Women were at the very bottom of the chain as far as bikers were concerned. Even if she had been patched which was doubtful. It did happen but it was rare and the woman had to be a hard ass like the men. She had to be able to roll with the punches and take it like a man.

""Holy shit, man. Trapper is gone?"" Hook frowned intensely.

""Her uncle stole her position and tried to force her into being property. She ran. End of story."" Well, Fuck. That was one line my men didn't fucking cross. Whores were whores by choice. If its by force, it's rape and that did not fly. I held my men to higher standards. Some presidents didn't care and tried to start wars with me over it, but I didn't budge. Jenny was sexy, but that didn't mean I would let any of my guys Fuck her against her will. Sure, I didn't mind my guys having a good time with the girls, but rape was a no go. The girls knew this was their life. Rarely did any of the girls put up a fight. If they did, my men knew to take a step back and I would come in and set her straight. The bitches knew what was expected of them, and they did their duty, or they would be shipped off to someone who wouldn't be nearly as nice as me and my guys were.

""Again, why is she here?"" He turned nervous.

""I need a favor."" That was what it always came down to with everyone. They needed help. His expression morphed sheepishly as he kicked his shoe against the dust on the floor.

""What kind?"" My head snapped at the sound of a glass breaking against the counter. The bartender gave me an indifferent look as he cleaned up the broken glass. Damn amateur.

""I know you're still looking for a bartender for the other bar your guys frequent. She's a bartender and fucking amazing at her job, brother. She made some drinks for the band last night that were top-notch."" I had a hard time believing that his experience had anything to do with my guy's needs. We didn't do those top-notch bomb drinks with swirly straws. We were rather simple, beers and straight liqueur. Plus, the girl would need to be cool with the drugs that my guys brought to the table.

""You want me to give a job to a chick I don't know?"" I was about to laugh in his face from that. I only gave jobs to people I knew wouldn't Fuck up. Just because Trapper was her Pops didn't mean squat to me. I didn't know this girl and I had never had a drink she prepped so the answer was definite no unless she could impress me in one way or another.

Then, I saw something incredible. Drill, one of my newer patched members, strolled right over to her with confidence and sex dripping from his eyes. He blocked her against the bar and her sky blue eyes lifted to him. I didn't hear what he said, but she roughly grabbed his head and forced it hard against her knee. I could hear the crack of either his bones or his teeth from a few feet away. My jaw dropped as I watched him shield his face. That sexy bitch hit like a fucking man. Next, she stood up, gripped his shoulder and lodged her knees into his stomach. Last, she kicked him straight in the balls and poor Drill crumbled to the floor, cupping his nuts. The room went stone-cold silent. Some of my guys looked at her with fear. Some were gawking with amusement. Me? I was staring at her in fucking lust.

""Don't ever call me 'doll',"" she threatened, in a voice sweet as honey. She had an accent, a thick, delicious accent that made my dick throb.

If I were to name two things in this world that were my biggest turn-ons, it would be a woman who could kick some serious ass and a woman with an accent. In my book, she couldn't possibly be more attractive than she was at that moment, standing over Drill.

Shit. My dick was in trouble. I could feel the blood stopped at my pole, making it impossible to think of anything else. Screw my promise to myself. I hadn't been this excited about a woman in a long time. That was unsettling. The last time I got anywhere near this excited was Annie, and we know how that turned out. It was apparent that she was nothing like Annie though. Jenny was a tough babe.

This girl was hot enough to be a Sports Illustrated model and what was I? A forty-five-year-old chapter president that looked like a fucking muscle. I wasn't ugly, but I was no Hook either. Women flocked to me because of my position and tattoos, girls mainly into mature men and bikes or they heard that my dick was pierced and was curious about it.

I doubt I had much of a chance. I was old enough to be her dad. Who knows? Maybe she was into the whole Daddy thing. Doubted it though.

""I'm going for a smoke, Bruce."" She glanced over at my good friend who nodded. Her eyes drifted to me. A flirtatious smirk rose across my lips, and she stared at me as she slipped off her jacket. I waited to see her reaction, but she didn't show one. She turned and made a runway walk out of the clubhouse, thrusting her middle finger in the air. A bunch of cheering from the bitches sounded through the room. I chuckled proudly as the rusty door squeaked to a halt, slamming against the steel frame. It was a closed curtain to the scene she just presented to the entire club.

""Okay, she's hired."" Hook raised a brow at me, surprised. Yup, Jenny had even affected me and I think Hook knew it.

""Really?"" I slowly nodded, smirking in the direction she disappeared in.

""Any girl who can flatten one of my guys is gold in my book."" Damn straight.

# Chapter Two: Jenny

Chapter Two

Jenny

Some men were such pigs. That duffus had the gall to call me 'doll' of all things! He deserved the kick in the balls. I may hail from a near-desert, but I was more of a desert cobra than a flower. That was one good thing I got from my dad, my thick skin.

It's been both a blessing and a curse. Guys I'd dated said I was an unfeeling demon. When things ended, I'd shrug it off and move on. I didn't really know what love was. It was a casualty of growing up in the club. When your father is a biker legend like Donald Saunders, you learn to trust no one. That's one reason why I would never let myself get dragged down by a biker. I saw what my dad's lifestyle did to my mom. He screwed around on her constantly, and she cried herself to sleep every single night while he was out with the guys. He had his whores and that was what really killed my mom. It wasn't the drugs or the criminal activity that did her in. It was the way my dad treated her like she wasn't the best thing that ever happened to him. He should've seen her as that. She loved him with her whole heart, and he crushed her every single day.

If there was ever a person in this world that I loved, it was my mom, and she was why I refused to ever let myself get sucked in by a biker that way. I had never even slept with a biker and I planned to keep it that way. The guys in my chapter knew not to Fuck with me n any way, shape, or form.

The only thing that had been tempting to change that was when I saw the biker that Bruce had been talking to. Bruce wasn't a biker, but he was a part of the chapter. That was confusing as hell. I didn't get how someone could be one and not the other.

The man that talked to Bruce had caught my attention. He was a bit rough, scarred across his jaw and through one of his eyebrows, quite the silver fox. He had thick salt and pepper hair, a trimmed beard, and honey-hazel eyes. He had light crow's feet around his eyes, but other than that, he didn't have wrinkles.

A white t-shirt, a Black Stallion's leather vest, and dark jeans covered his muscular, tattooed body. I doubted even a leather jacket could hide those bulges.

What was wrong with me? Why the hell would I check him out? He was a biker! I would never get involved with someone like him. Bikers were man whores. Who knows what diseases I could catch from him! Ugh!

I had to admit. He was ruggedly attractive and there was....something there. Like an undeniable connection between two people who didn't know a single thing about each other. It was something I had only ever read about in ridiculous romance novels. Two strangers locking eyes and feeling an intensity, a connection, a desire form. They would find each other, talk, realize they were soulmates destined to get married, have kids, and live happily ever after.

I scoffed at the thought. As if! I wasn't an idiot. That man had every biker bitch at his disposal to satisfy every desire he had. That wasn't me.

I was nowhere close to being a virgin, but I wasn't a slut either. Just because a biker asked me to suck his dick didn't mean I would. Even if it was that attractive silver fox!

I rubbed my hand up the back of my shirt under the fabric, feeling the still sore bruises of my uncle's force. I knew my dad was an idiot. He actually thought he could get away with naming me as his heiress. Like I could ever be the president of the Sydney Black Stallions chapter. No one was going to stand for it and Dad paid for that with his life. My punishment for his stupid decision was my Uncle Ronny, Crack, trying to force me into being a whore to his buddies. Like he thought I had forced my dad to name me his heiress. He accused me of sleeping with my own father to manipulate him. Ew!

My dad had foreseen someone trying to force themselves on me at one point in my life, and he gave me the necessary skills to escape the situation. No man that came at me that night left unscathed. Crack included.

I escaped the clubhouse and ran to my cousin from my mom's side of the family, Liam. I spent a couple of days at his place before I finally told him what had happened, why I was running from Crack, and why I could never go back to Sydney.

I knew Crack had a hit on me now. Luckily, I did have allies in his organization who were loyal to me. Mostly, the newer guys, ol ladies, and bitches.

When Liam suggested going to the local clubhouse, I almost bolted. I knew what would happen if I was found by my uncle. I would be killed and buried with my dad, if I was lucky. It was the only way for Crack to ensure that I didn't take away his power. I didn't want it, but he didn't give me a chance to tell him that. He just jumped on the let's turn my niece into a whore against her will train.

Liam told me that the local chapter was disassociated with the Sydney Black Stallions because of 'Gunner'. He was the president of the chapter and didn't go by the same rules as the other presidents. He did right by his men, but didn't allow certain things that other clubs shrugged at. Liam said if Gunner agreed that I was right in running that he wouldn't turn me in to Crack. I was willing to take the chance of getting protection from my psychotic uncle if Gunner was really how Liam had described.

Liam contacted Bruce who took me to the public clubhouse. It looked like all the other clubhouses I had ever been to. The intention was to introduce me to Gunner but unless he was the jackass I kicked in the balls, it didn't happen. I wasn't surprised that the duffus biker had the balls to ask me to drop to my knees and suck him off. Normally, I would've laughed at him and told him that he wasn't man enough to handle me, but then he added 'doll'.

No one called me a doll! I would go Biker Lola Bunny on their asses for even uttering a syllable of that disgusting word.

The bikers used to call me that when I was a kid, and it always pissed me off. If someone wanted to see the biker in my DNA, call me a fucking doll!

Strolling out the front door of the biker bar, I took notice of the parking lot. I hadn't been paying attention before. I noticed the bikes, of course, but one thing I noticed then was the distressed and peeling paint on the cement walls outside the bar. It looked like once there had been a mural of a woman with light blonde hair and purple eyes but the paint was so aged that I could barely tell it had ever been there. She was pretty.

The mural had a caption. RIP Davina Devereaux. So her name was Davina? Was she one of the girls from the chapter? Why was there a mural of her? So many questions her picture left.

I pulled out a cigarette and lit it up as I kicked one of the many pieces of gravel in the parking lot.

Some bikes were covered in scuffs and scratches while a select few shined like a new penny. There were two pickup trucks, one being Bruce's truck, and a four-door painted cherry red. That car was probably the bartenders' vehicle. He didn't seem like a truck kind of guy. I was curious who the big, mist blue Silverado with a massive Harley in the bed of the truck belonged to.

That bike was beautiful. It had the black diamond with red outlining near the front tire which I smirked at. Kudos to the One Percenter.

""That one is Gunners,"" Bruce stated as he walked out of the bar and I stood up, tossing down my smoke.

""Hmm. It's nice."" It was true. The bike was in perfect condition. It made me miss my own bike.

I strolled over to Bruce's truck and climbed in. His truck was pretty old and beaten up for a rockstar. I was surprised and not at the same time. Everyone had heard of his band, Mayes, and I personally fangirled when I got to meet his wonderful wife, Sally. I wasn't really a Mayes fan until she joined his team. Sally Mayes was definitely my Justin Bieber.

""Did you talk to Gunner?"" I inquired to Bruce, as he drove me out of the parking lot, and he nodded.

""Yeah, all is good. He was pretty impressed by you."" I looked at him perplexed. What had I done that could impress someone?

""Impressed?"" He nodded and smirked.

""When you dropped Drill, the biker who approached you. Gunner respects any woman who can go toe to toe with him or any of his guys."" That was surprising. Most guys hated strong women like me. I was used to the scrutiny.

""Really?"" He grinned.

""Yeah. I got you a job at a bar they run. They're in need of a bartender, and he liked you. That's a big deal, just so you know. Gunner doesn't like many people. He tolerates most people."" Sounds like something we have in common.

""Ripper"" I didn't have much else to say without sounding like a bitch. I didn't want to seem ungrateful to Bruce. He was a nice guy, for a guy. I was a bit untrusting of guys. I guess that came with my uncle trying to get me gang-raped.

""A bit of friendly advice, Jenny. Don't get involved with any of the bikers,"" he stated out of nowhere, and I gave him a sideways glance.

""I'm not into bikers. Trust me. It's not going to happen,"" I explained, and he nodded.

""Gunner is the only one of those guys that are even a bit trustworthy. He can get pretty possessive though.""

""Why do you keep talking about him?"" I sneered. It was a bit annoying. I wanted a silent car ride. I didn't even want to go to the clubhouse. It was Bruce's idea to take me to see Gunner. I was a bit uncomfortable being there considering what happened the last time I went to a clubhouse to meet bikers.

""I saw you guys looking at each other. I'm not blind,"" he explained, and I groaned.

""Who?""

""Gunner.""

""I don't even know who he was in there."" I was beyond agitated at this point. Why was Bruce doing this now?

""I was talking to him when you dropped Drill."" Oh. My. God. No. Not the silver fox.

""You mean the guy with the scar on his eyebrow?"" I didn't want Bruce to know I paid much attention to him or that I had an attraction for him. Damn. I hoped to avoid the silver fox. He just became twice as off-limits as before. He was my new boss, Gunner.

""Yup, that's Gunner."" I slowly nodded before looking out the window. I just wanted to climb back in bed and forget that man for now. Maybe I would remember him later when I was touching myself. In the shower. Relieving some tension. No, bad idea Jenny. I can't be giving in to these desires. It would make it seem too logical. It wasn't possible to even just Fuck him. Maybe if he wasn't the president of the chapter, I could just Fuck him and forget him. If he was just some random guy in a bar, I could Fuck him then leave. I could get him out of my system, but that wasn't possible.

I would not become a whore for bikers. Not even for Gunner.

""His name is Xander. Xander Davenport."" That was all Bruce said on the subject, and he dropped it. The rest of the ride was silent.

That name was repeating over and over in my head. Xander Davenport. Xander. God, why was that name so fucking sexy and make my skin buzz with arousal?

Shit. This was going to be way harder than I thought. I was in trouble.

Okay. The first step was to admit I had a problem. I wanted Xander 'Gunner' Davenport. I wanted him bad, but I had to resist my lady bits trying to lead me to do something stupid.

Maybe I was just like my mom, and I was being drawn in by something I thought I saw in him that wasn't really there. If that were the case, I knew I was in trouble.

Hailee Steinfeld's Flashlight was blaring through my phone in my room at Liam's house, while I surfed the internet on my laptop. I was looking to see if I had any better job opportunities than working in a biker bar. Sadly, the other options were worse. Two strip clubs, three lesbian bars, and one bachelor party, and that was for one night. I put in an application for the bachelor party. At least that would bring in some extra cash, so I could get my own place.

I was frustrated and consigned to working in that biker bar. That didn't mean I had to be happy about it. If I worked there, I would be more tempted by Xander Davenport, and I wanted to stay away from the temptation.

I slammed my computer shut and turned off the music before going downstairs.

Liam was the proud owner of a two-story, five bedroom house. The exterior was plastered in stucco and painted white with black shingles and matching shutters on the windows. There was a pool in the backyard and a pool house. The interior was laid back. White walls, a few photographs on the walls, and black leather furniture.

The living room had a ceiling high fireplace, two sofas, a glass coffee table, and soft, white carpet. It was the same carpet everywhere except the dining room and the kitchen.

Liam was cooking in the modern kitchen that any housewife would kill for. His bodyguard, Trip, sitting at the mahogany kitchen table, playing on his phone like a teenager.

""Hey, Jen!"" Liam smiled at me, and I returned it. We weren't even close, but we used to be pen pals. He always said if I ever wanted to escape that his door was always open, and he lived true to his word. I would always be grateful to him for that.

""Liam, hey,"" I said, as I ran my fingers through my hair.

""How did it go at the bar?"" he asked, while turning down the stove. Liam and Trip were gone when I arrived, so I hadn't gotten to tell Liam that I got offered a job by Xander.

""As could be expected, I guess."" I strolled over to the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water from the drawer.

""Which means what exactly?"" he asked and Trip snickered.

""She kicked one of my brother's asses."" Trip grinned big, and Liam's jaw dropped.

""What?"" He looked at me accusingly.

""He called me 'doll' and asked for a blow job. Well, asked would be putting it lightly. He demanded I drop to my knees. He was asking for an ass-whooping,"" I justified my actions and Trip laughed.

""Seriously? That's what he said to you?"" I nodded, and Trip grinned big. ""Way to go putting him in his place like that. He's new and doesn't know how things work yet. If the boss heard him say that to you, I doubt he will be around much longer."" Trip explained, and I was befuddled. What was that supposed to mean? He was talking about Gunner, Xander, right?

""Why?"" I asked, as I took a seat across from Trip at the table.

""Because the boss has a thing for you. Obviously."" My eyes widened. ""I got a text from Hook. He said he saw it. Xander has tell-tale signs for those that know him. It's easy to tell once you get to know him. People that don't know him can't tell,"" Trip uttered, and I looked over to Liam who had his protective cousin mask on.

""Be careful there, Jen,"" Liam warned, and I rolled my eyes. I had already resigned myself. I was not going to Fuck Xander Davenport no matter how much my pussy was begging for it.

""I don't date or Fuck bikers. I'm going out to the pool."" I waved to them, as I went out the back door.

I loved Liam's pool. He had a gate installed around the pool, loungers set up around the rectangular-shaped pool, and the pool house built a few feet from the pool. The pool house was more like a tiny house painted an ocean blue with yellow trim. The inside was like an island getaway with a hammock in the living room instead of couches. The small kitchen only had a microwave and a sink, no table or chairs. The bedroom in the back was simple. A queen sized bed with a bedside table and that was the extent of the pool house. It didn't even have a bathroom.

I went to the pool house and changed into my black string bikini. I stole some sunscreen and put on a good amount before walking out to the poolside. I put in my earbuds and turned on the music on my phone. Korn's Coming Undone filled my ears, and I relaxed against the lounger.

People thought I listened to a strange mix of music. I liked all kinds of music, but I listened to a lot of rock around the bikers back home. Korn and Incubus reminded me of my dad, and I was starting to miss him a lot.

If he had heard what Trip was saying about Xander, he would've done some pretty gnarly things to Xander for even looking at me. Actually, most of the guys in the clubhouse would've lost their dicks. My dad was pretty protective of me which was probably why Crack went so above and beyond with his punishment of me.

I was always Daddy's little girl in his eyes. Another reason why guys didn't stick around long. I didn't mind. That was for the best. I didn't want guys to stay around longer than they were useful. No use in leaving a string of broken hearts behind in my wake.

I must've dozed off because when I opened my eyes there were at least fifty people around. I sat up, pushing my sunglasses up my forehead.

Half were women, supermodel gorgeous with revealing bathing suits, and the other half were men wearing either swimming trunks or shorts that they were pretending were for swimming. It was a pool party. I think Liam mentioned it last night. It must've slipped my mind. I recognized a couple of the men from the clubhouse, and then I caught sight of him.

Xander Davenport. He looked so scrumptious. He was shirtless, showcasing his gorgeous tattoos and thick muscles, and he had on some black and gray swim trunks.

People were playing pool volleyball and the ball hit right next to Xander. He picked it up and pegged it at one of his men, laughing happily. He might've been rough around the edges, but I was sure of one thing about him. When he laughed and smiled, he was beautiful. His teeth shined, and his eyes twinkled with enjoyment, accenting his crows feet around his eyes.

Then, his eyes met mine, and I had been caught staring at him. Damn it.",1,1748301631.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

These systems don't work because they're clever. They work because your brain is a predictable machine with exploitable design flaws built into its basic architecture.

We both share a love of classic cars, listen to the same music and going to concerts together, love cooking good food together, love gaming, playing card games in pubs and going out for coffee and cake; the list could go on. I should also add that our sex life and attraction for each other couldn't be stronger. But the issue that has been really starting to wear me down is that I've become so aware that when we're not actively doing something we really struggle making conversation. 

My partner isn't very talkative, and I consider myself a bit more of a 'listener' too, so I often need other people to drive conversation so I can riff off of them, and it seems like she is the same. But this means that when we sit across from each other over dinner or in a cafe we just don't have any form of meaningful conversation. We might comment on things we like, i.e. ""this coffee is great"", ""I like his boots over there"", ""I can't believe how lucky we've been with the weather"", but it's just not stimulating in the slightest, and I feel like I desperately yearn for good, meaningful conversation to feel truly close to someone and to get to know them deeply. I want us to riff off of each other and to lose time to our long chats.

  
This is the first time in my life I've ever dated someone much younger than myself, and I suspect a lot of it has to do with my partner being less adept in casual conversation, and perhaps the conversation I find stimulating is simply boring to her, hence why it doesn't even occur to her to talk about. 

  
What could a possible solution be? Has anyone else experienced a similar issue and made it work with their significant other? Is this the sign of a doomed relationship/ an incompatibility?   

It's beginning to effect how I feel about my partner as it's all I can focus on when we're together, as I'm constantly screaming in my head, ""what do we talk about???""

I'm losing my hair due to hormone issues and I've been trying to stop it from happening by trying different methods, and I've found out about a few things that might help.
Firstly, I realized that my scalp is not oily, it's actually dry, that's why my hair gets super oily super fast, I tried a few home remedies that my friend uses and has helped her and they dried my scalp so much that it started Bruning and itching for the whole weeks I was trying the remedies out, turns out her scalp is oily and mine is not.
So, I read a few posts from here and after some Google searches I realized tear free baby shampoo is the best option for me, I took a medium sized container (about 200 miligram) and poured a small packet of instant coffee (about half a table spoon or more), a few cloves and two sticks of cinnamon (crushed slightly before being added, they'll sink down the bottle so don't worry about them getting into your hair) and I swear not only my itchy scalp was gone after the first wash, but also my hair loss has been reduced to over 80 percent! My hair also holds its oil free condition for two days, I used to get oily hair one day after washing it. Have been using this remedy for two months now and have tried chocolate powder instead of coffee as well and it's still great! (Chocolate powder enhances the scent of the shampoo tenfold!). I've also used health supplements as well, so I'd say it's like I'm working from both on the inside and outside as well.
So yeah, if you have a dry scalp this remedy might help you!",0,1748300701.0,Haircare,1,0.5,False

# Chapter 1

The useless sun seems to be laying its course on me because it was Damm hurting my skin...... not to mention the loud noise of the alarm clock that kept on ringing nonstop.

'Ah!'. I yelled out in pain while throwing my pillow towards the alarm clock.

The clock seems to be lucky today because the pillow didn't touch it, which made it continue ringing.

'Lord God! who did I offend?'. Jennifer asked as she sluggishly got up from the bed.

My name is Jennifer from a respected poor family who helps her lovely mother every day in the market. Each time I go to the market, something terrible happens that I keep asking myself if I'm the cause of all this because whenever I'm not here everything seems to be alright.

Today is another market day, and all I can wish for is that things should go well as I have always planned.

I walked up towards the bathroom and immediately stripped naked with my eyes closed because I still felt sleepy.

Since I came from a poor family........ I didn't fancy the things of the rich, which include a bathtub.

To me, bathtubs are meant for the rich, and that's why I don't fancy it because it doesn't have any difference from a shower.

I turn on the shower and allow my long black hair to become soaked with water. Watching my hair and body with the clean water coming out of the shower, I smiled at how refreshing it was before grabbing my black towel.

The reason I didn't use a bathing soap is that recently I have been too broke to afford the cheapest soap in town, or should I say I was just too busy to think about buying a soap.

I walk up to my bed, which has a lot of clothes on it, which includes both the neat and dirty ones.

Grabbing a white paint, and a pink bra........ I quickly wore them on my body, without cleaning my wet body because my phone was already vibrating, and the only person who could call me early in the morning was my mom.

'Guess I'm gonna be dead now'. I muttered to myself while running out of my room.

'OMG! I forgot to wear my dress'. Jennifer exclaimed while running back to her room.

She grabs a pair of dark blue jeans and wears them as quickly as possible, before grabbing her only shirt .......which is a black shirt.

Jennifer doesn't have any other shirt except for this black shirt which she bought last three years with her savings for that year.

At that time, she had to save one dollar every week, until it got up to four dollars.

Staring at her pink ugly slippers, she smiles at herself before running out of the house........ while heading to the market where her Mom sells vegetables and fruits.

Heading to the market, she started praying inwardly.......... because she doesn't want to be accused of being a cursed child because things most times........ don't go well with her.

I was on my way to the market to help my mum in her shade when I saw this tall slim handsome man. I stared at him continually and he had a light tattoo all over his neck. His appearance alone made me fall in love with him at first sight but he didn't even look at me or even know that someone was staring at him.

The guy is Damn handsome, with black wavy hair that looks soft like that of a baby. 'His hair texture looks like that of mine' I said to myself blushing, but then my evil inner voice scolded me, causing me to shake my head sideways.

'Don't be a crazy young lady........ there's no way his hair looks like yours'. My inner voice said, causing a frown to appear on my face.

The guy tattoo is painted on his neck and seems to be the drawing of an anime girl. His black hair was calling my attention, not to mention that each time he opened his mouth to utter something to the market woman who was attending to him, it made me feel my heart jumping out of its cage.

The guy's leg is long and sexy, and he looks like the guy of my dreams. 'Today! My dream is finally going to come true. I said to myself while walking closer to the guy.

I paused for a while and arranged my shirt and used my fingers to comb my hair, before proceeding further. I licked my lips with my saliva and was about to call out to the guy when he suddenly turned around and bumped into me.

He was holding a juice can, when he turned around and bumped into Jennifer, which caused the juice can to turn upside down, as it poured into Jennifer's body.

""Ohh my gosh! I'm so sorry........I didn't mean to splash it on you"". The guy said with a base, yet breathtaking voice.

""Hmm...... you don't need to be so.... sorry!"". Jennifer answered while stammering.

""Wait! I'll pay for the mess I created on your dress"". He said while placing his hands on his pocket, like if he wanted to bring a napkin...... but Jennifer quickly stopped him from proceeding further.

""Hmm..... don't worry about me..... umm... just worry about yourself"". Jennifer said as she smiled while exposing her teeth in full display. ""You can have this....... use it to clean your face...... it... hmm... it looks wet"". Jennifer added while blushing as she stared at the man's brown sexy eyes.

She was behaving very weird, so the handsome young man refused to collect the napkin and shove it back to Jennifer.

""Thanks but no! you can have the napkin to yourself, I'm cool with my wet face"". The man said while walking away.

""Haha! please have the napkin....... your face is wet"". Jennifer replied while maintaining the smile on her face.

""No, you don't have to be such a formal young lady. Besides I'm the one who mistakenly pours the juice on your body..... so sorry"". The guy said.

""No way! it's either you take the napkin from my hands, or you can kindly give me your number as a means of compensation"". Jennifer said while smiling exposing her teeth.

The handsome Mister standing in front of her shakes his head sideways as he walks away from her.

Without staring back, he made a loud declaration which made Jennifer pray for the ground to open wide and swallow her immediately.

""Sorry Miss! but I don't do girls like you....... and just to be sincere.......I do think you should try to talk to people who are your class"". The guy said while walking away.

Jennifer couldn't see his current expression, but all she could see was the guy's sexy back.......which made her forget for a minute that the guy insulted her not a while ago.

Jennifer ran back to her mother's shop while smiling like a crazy woman who had just won a lottery....... and not just any type of lottery! but the most special lottery of all time.

Her mom's shop was filled with few customers..... so she quickly attended to them, before sitting down on the small stool in her mom's store.

Jennifer placed her hands on her chin, as she kept daydreaming of the guy who she just saw without her being aware that someone was standing right in front of her.

Creating an image of the guy's sexy lips touching her lips, made her blush hard. Not to mention the fact that if she's walking with the guy……. he had to introduce me to his other male friends. Jennifer pounder.

'Gush! it's going to be more than romantic'. She whispered to herself as she kept on daydreaming.

""Miss! are you alright?"". A young man asked while snapping his finger, causing me to snap back to reality.

# Chapter 2

Submitting credentials in this city is very difficult but I finally have the chance to. I was woken up from my bed by my landlord's terrible dogs barking at a stranger . A passerby got my attention with a terrible look on my face that I didn't have the chance to enjoy my sleep.

Getting up I had to prepare something to eat, take my bath and get ready for the interview which I know very well that I won't be selected. The only food I could prepare fast right now is noodles and I rashly get my wheat flour, water, and salt for preparation.

This food is so hot, I need to manage, I'm already getting late for my interview.

Walking toward the market trying to get a motorcycle for the unknown place I am about to go for the interview and I saw this girl.

This girl is so beautiful and I watched the scenery of how this young man mistakenly poured juice on her and she is deliberately offering him a napkin which is wrong. I'm really confused and look at how he pushed her and drove off. ""Damn! She is beautiful but I guess her day is ruined already. Take a Look at her. She is a dreamboat. I'm always the novice type of guy. Let me approach her to see if maybe I might catch the attention of this pretty lady"". Jeffrey talks to himself

""Hello, hello, hello. Sorry to bother you, I'm looking for London street"". Jeffrey asked this pretty lady trying to get the attention of her but yet she didn't even smile at him.

""Oh London street, take the first Street by your right"".

Jennifer turned to look at him which was after he snapped his finger. She thought he was the man she just met but he didn't have a tattoo on his neck, and she just quickly went into the shop with a frown written all over her face.

""Thank you madam"". Jeffrey replied

My inner mind keeps telling me to at least make this beautiful girl smile, but how will I do that? I'm a novice. I can't even ask her properly about the street and you want me to further the conversation. I can't.

Reaching London street, Jeffrey also has to ask for a rashnix company which he was given direction by madam Choe. A woman selling snacks by the road side.

""Hello sir, I'm here for the interview"" Jeffrey talks to the gateman

The man was putting on plain black trousers and a green long sleeve. He is tall and has grey hair, he seems 57 years old, his dressing was quite different from gatekeepers that I do come across. His tune alone will tell you that he's friendly , not to mention the pleasant smile on his face.

""You are welcome, take the first door by your left, you will see your age groups sitting by the side, join them because they are also here for the interview and you are quite late"". The gateman told Jeffrey the direction of the interview center.

'Ohh my God will this interview get to my turn today. I must wait. I have been searching for a job for a long time now, maybe this is a temptation for me to back down'. Jeffrey encouraged himself to wait till it get to his turn

It's already 5 pm. 'Will I be able to wait? Where will I sleep? Anyway I should wait, they could call my name anytime'. Jeffrey said to himself in frustration.

""Jeffrey!...... Jeffery!......, is Jeffrey not there?"" Mr. Samson, manager of rashnix company.

Mr. Samson was a short young man with a little mustache on his face. He was putting on blue dark suit wear that complement his blue fancy shoes. His eye color is coffee brown, a dark brown hat was placed on his hair complementing his outfit. He looks so handsome but his aura alone could make fear creep into the body of his workers, not to mention that he looks very young....... probably twenty-four or twenty-five.

""Sir, I'm right here please pardon me"" Jeffrey quickly answered his name with the fear and tension all written all over him.

""Are you deaf? where are you when I'm shouting your name?"" Mr. Samson asked Jeffrey with a loud voice.

""Can you please identify yourself and tell us why you are here"". Mr. Samson asked again.

""I'm sorry for not answering my name on time. Please pardon my manner. My name is Nagaoka Jeffrey and I'm 27 years old. I worked as an office manager for a mid-sized office supplies company. It was a jack-of-all-trades type role where my general duties were to help generate and qualify leads for the sales team, create cross-team reports for the marketing, product, and sales teams, and ensure consistent scheduling and inventory.

I grew into this role from a receptionist position, where my duties were more client-facing. One thing that caught my eye in your job posting was that it called for a versatile background like mine, and much of my experience managing XYZ Inc S office will translate well into the operations manager position here"". Jeffrey identifies himself for he doesn't know when he said all this. It was like a miracle in his life.

""Write your number, get up and leave,"" Mr. Samson told Jeffrey.

""Sorry sir, are that all the questions?"" Jeffrey with a sad face was confused and he knew that he had failed the interview.

""Yeah, thanks for coming,"" Mr. Samson told Jeffrey with a smile on his face.

""I guess it was a waste of time coming all the way here just for this interview and all I could get is get out and leave"" Jeffrey complained bitterly about why he wastes his effort coming to this interview.

After being sure that Mr. Jeffrey have left the premises, Mr. Samson turn and said

""Wow! look at that guy's punctuation. He is very good. I hope we get him this job. He is the man for this job"". Mr. Samson compliments Jeffrey to his other colleague complaining to him about the interview.

Inside the company lies tMr. Kassim and Mrs. Lillian, who were both discussing…..

Mr. Kassim wore his face like people wear a hat, putting on a business formal dress. His hair was almost as white as the snow but he had deep black. He has a black oval-shaped eye and a small nose. He is Mr. Samson's companion and he loves being around him. sometimes they do going into an argument that might even lead to malign for like three-four days but yet the friendship with Mr. Samson is also a memory to him. and

Mrs. Lillian, a well-trained intelligent lady with a little dimple on her face, was putting on an asymmetrical off-shoulder satin Duchesse gown, reflecting a black, white and beige disruptive pattern. Lilian was Mr. Samson's secretary who people thought she was Mr. Samson's girlfriend because the closeness alone will tell that Mr. Samson and Mrs. Lillian had something in common but this was never true.

"" Why did you tell him to get up and leave just like that? if you like him and you want him to get the job, you could have said something at least to make Mr. Jeffrey feel relaxed but now I guess he is terrified that he won't make it"" Mr. Kassim questions Mr. Samson with an awkward smile.

""I wanted to make him feel bad and then surprised him with the job. it sounds great this way"" Mr. Samson replied using a beautiful smile written all over his face.

""Sir, to be frank, it's an expensive play but let's just hope it walks out fine"" Mrs. Lillian complimented Mr. Samson.

\*\*

On my way home with a frown on my face, I decided to greet madam choe who gave me directions to the Rashnix company.

""Mummy thank you ma, I'm done with the interview. can I have a juice and snack to step down please"".

Jeffrey collected the chilled juice and snack as he sip the drink into his little mouth when he saw this little pretty black approaching towards him? She had a sculptured figure which was twine-thin. Her waist tapered and she had a burnished complexion. A pair of arched eyebrows looked down on sweeping eyelashes. Her delicate ears framed a button nose. A set of dazzling, angel-white teeth gleamed as she blew gently on her carmine-red fingernails. It was a pleasure to see her flowing, moon shadow-black hair. She wore vibrant clothes that made me forget all about the interview.

""My son, how was the interview?"" Madam Choe asked and wondered why his mouth was open steering at her daughter.

""My son, how was the interview?""?. She asked again.

""Oh madam, the interview was a mess for me, I guess I'm not worthy of the kind of job they want. Can you imagine, I was asked to identify myself and I did but the reply I could get was to drop your number, get up and leave. it's frustrating and I'm really tired because getting here isn't easy for me"". Jeffrey explain how the interview went as the pretty lady walks very close to him

""Don't get discouraged. When one door is closed, another door is going to open"". madam choe try to console Jeffrey

""Thank you ma, is this your daughter?"" Jeffrey asked drinking his juice and eating his snacks

""Yes she is"" madam choe reply

"" I must confess your daughter is really beautiful, mere looking at her alone, I lost focus and forgot about the interview"" Jeffrey said to madam choe with a joyful smile looking towards the pretty lady.

""Young man, what are you trying to do here........be very careful, please. I will beat you up"" madam choe replying and laugh at the same time

""Thank you ma! but I will be on my way now.. see you some other time""

Should I go see the girl at the market or should I go home, take my bath and think about my life. it is already late though so it is better I go home, maybe some other time I will be opportune to see her.

walking towards the road when I heard a heavy brake stop at my left hand and I looked at myself and saw that I'm in the middle of the road. The owner of the car came down shouting at me but I quickly ran out.

Reaching home I pulled off my shirt and sat at the chair thinking how I could have lost my life because of thinking about a job. Thinking is very bad. Thank God I'm still alive. Still thinking he slept off and even forgot to eat and take his bath.",1,1748300475.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Got this pc in high school and now it’s old enough for elementary school, so it’s time to upgrade. It’s mostly used for gaming and I’m fine with the performance with games like Black Ops 6 on Low settings or league of legends, but it does stutter quite a bit on Black Ops 6 or with higher end single player games like Cyberpunk even on low settings, I’m struggling to get >60fps.


Existing parts/monitors to reuse? 

I’m okay with reusing any parts if they’re compatible with other upgrades, mostly want to upgrade pc performance with a GPU power of around a Nvidia RTX 2080 or better. Probably going to at least stick with the case, monitors, storage, and fans. Here is what I currently have:

GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 8gb VRAM

CPU: IntelCore I7-8700 12 threads 3.2 GHz

Motherboard: Maximus x hero

RAM: 16GB

Cooling: 5 large fans

Storage: 4tb SSD

Case: very large, can be used as a coffee table

Monitors: 1440p LG Ultragear, 1080p Asus VG248


PC purpose? Gaming. 

Need something that could run a game like Cyberpunk or Oblivion Remastered on High graphics settings, which my pc is struggling to run at Medium to Low graphics at >60fps on a 1440p monitor. Other than high end single player games, I want to be able to run multiplayer games like Black Ops 6 and MMOs like FFXIV.


Purchase country? >1hr to micro center, United States, any store really, I’m in a population dense area. Amazon or other delivery services are fine as well.


Monitors needed? None


Budget range? Preferably lower than 1,000$ USD, but not a strict limit. Also budget friendly, would be happy to spend $500 on just a GPU upgrade if it’ll get me the results I need. I don’t want to spend money, but can if I need to.


WiFi or wired connection? Wired, not needed.


Size constraints? None, tower the size of a coffee table.


Noise constraints: None I like when I can hear the computer “thinking”.


Color/lighting preferences? None but if there’s a cheaper anything without RGB then I want that one.


Any other specific needs? Job satisfaction, a masters degree probably, a new apartment",2,1748300251.0,buildapcforme,4,1.0,False
