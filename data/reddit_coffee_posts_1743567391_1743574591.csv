I (24m) have been casually seeing this guy (24m) for about 3 weeks now. I know where I want things to go, but dont know if its too soon to have the talk. 

Context: 
We chatted on grindr for a bit and he invited me over for a hookup pretty quickly. I politely declined, telling him I like to get to know people for a bit first. We got coffee a few days later, I didn't necessarily think it was a date, but he was really nervous the whole time, asked me for a kiss, and then had a huge grin after we kissed. We went back to his place, cuddled and watched TV, and then fooled around a bit. 

The next day, we hungout again. It was pretty late and he doesn't drink, so I picked him up, we drove around for like an hour, went back to my place, watched a movie, and had sex. It was like 2am at this point and I had to work in the morning, so I made a comment about taking him home, and he asked if he could spend the night. I politely declined, he was very understanding, and I took him home. At this point, I kinda felt like a jerk, so I texted him and told him essentially ""had a great time, sorry for not having you spend the night, im just not ready for that yet, but i am interested in more than just hooking up"". He said it was all good and that he felt the same.

A week later, we had plans to hangout at like 4pm and watch a movie again. He ended up postponing to 6 and then 8. I had friends coming over at 9, so we ended up canceling and decided to get lunch and hangout the next day. I picked him up, we went to lunch, and then he asked me if i would take him to the store, so I did. And then he said he was tired and just wanted to go home and nap, so I dropped him off at home. 

It's been about a week since then and we haven't hangout again, but we have been trying. I work full time as well as a full time student, and I just started a new set of classes so I havent quite figured out my schedule yet. He also isn't much of a texter, so I'll hear from him maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the day. But he still flirts, asks to hangout, sends me cute messages, etc. 

Here's my main problem. When I said I was interested in more than just hooking up, I did mean that. He's very sweet, a total cutie, easy to talk to, and I feel comfortable with him... but now that I've gotten to know him, I don't want anything that serious. Nothing against him, he's a great guy and I really like spending time with him, but we just aren't very compatible and I can't even remotely imagine having a more serious relationship with him. we have basically no common ground when it comes to hobbies, interests, goals, values, etc. 

Ideally, I want things to stay the way they are. I like going on dates, talking, cuddling, hanging out, and having sex. But I have no desire to be exclusive or move past this surface level type of dating with him. So... when do I bring that up? I just don't want to lead him on and waste his time if he wants more than this. But I'm also open to the possibility that I may be hasty in this judgement, so I don't want to shoot myself in the foot if I realize I DO want more. I've been out of the dating scene for a while and I'm used to connecting with people very quickly and intensely, so I don't really know what to do here ü´° thanks bros!

But for my last round of scripts I searched the subreddit took a recommendation and I‚Äôm no closer to getting good sleep. Ive done the same thing maybe half a dozen times now but yet to find something that works well.

Right now my strains are:

Daytime: black cherry punch

Daytime2: coffee creamer

Nighttime: permanent marker

Night time2: amethyst


I have tried quite a few others but to be totally honest ever since moving to MC I‚Äôve never slept as well as I previously did on BM product. Is it because MC is all THC and almost no CBD? Anyone else had a similar experience? I used to sleep like a baby on almost any BM strain but now I‚Äôm on MC I struggle to get a proper sleep and I‚Äôm taking at least 2hrs in bed before dozing off which is a major step backwards from when I was using BM strains.

Anyone have any ideas or fool proof recommendations for strains that will get you to sleep? Have tried a few strains in the past won‚Äôt list them all here but any ideas of reliable sleep strains would be much appreciated.",2,1743574319.0,MedicalCannabisOz,1,1.0,False

Less than a month ago, I got a brand new LMR. Today, after turning the machine on, I noticed that there isn't any steam pressure. In the app, it shows ""Steam boiler ready in 29 minutes."". I tried completely unplugging and turning it on again, as well as performing a factory reset in the app, but nothing helped.  
  
A couple of days ago, I turned off the steam boiler and used only the coffee boiler, but it would be strange if that caused the issue. I looked inside the machine and wasn't sure if these two were the circuit breaker switches (attached image). I tried pressing them, and one made a faint clicking sound, but that didn't help either.

I agreed to meet, and when we got there, he arrived early, which is fine, but here‚Äôs where things got a little awkward. He had already bought himself a coffee when I arrived, and he didn‚Äôt offer to buy mine, even though he asked me out.

I‚Äôm all for equality, but I do think that if someone invites you out, offering to pay or at least buy the coffee is a pretty basic and thoughtful gesture. To me, it felt a little cheap and low-effort especially since the coffee was only $4. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to spend a ton of money ($100 max), but when you‚Äôre the one initiating plans, it seems like common courtesy to show some effort, especially on the first date.

Now, I‚Äôm left wondering: if he‚Äôs this cheap now, will he ever stop being cheap? And if this turns into something more, how could I marry a man like this? I don‚Äôt want to sound materialistic, but I also don‚Äôt want to end up with someone who isn‚Äôt willing to put in the effort. I feel like this was a bit one-sided, and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm reading too much into it or if it‚Äôs a red flag.

He‚Äôs now asked me out again for a second date, but I‚Äôm not sure if I should accept. What do you think? Should I give him another chance, or is this a sign that it‚Äôs not worth pursuing?

My honest review,"So, I came across Winzo after seeing a short Instagram ad. The claims in the ad was the winzo had games that allowed you to play games and win real money. It did sound interesting, I mean real money was involved, so I did not immediately trust it, right? Too many graphics were coming out of the screen, so it looked alluring. I decided to check out a few reviews. Since, I looked for the app on App Store, I saw that it had a solid 4.5 ratings, so this did lift my confidence. I also checked out Trustpilot to see what real people were saying about their experience and did they even make money. Turns out, winzo is quite fun, it had 4 stars on Trustpilot. I noticed it had Bingo and Uno, I love both these games so I decided why not actually try these out and make my own mind.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/ljaukvkq3dse1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=f38b0967bb007e239a2472354690bf8fe633ac46

Downloading etc were pretty simple and straightforward. You know the best part - I got a $1 signup bonus to start my game. Pretty cool. I clicked on Bingo and interestingly a casino table popped out - it was the match-making scene where your opponent is being located. Now, this took some time. Something for the team to look into. Anyways, you are paired opposite a real person.¬†

Coming back to the game, Bingo was pretty easy. Yes, the colors were a bit loud, not my type and it was not like the conventional app and it took few games to get adjusted. The first game I won, but then lost the next two rounds. Actually, I was playing in smaller boots, 20 cents so at the end of three rounds I still had enough money to try out Uno. Same match-making casino like board, you get an opponent and this time I actually made 5 dollars. Yeah, Uno was awesome. I still had my reservations with the money so wanted to withdraw my winnings immediately. This was a big win, could get it in my account very easily with PayPal. No waiting around for the money, but quick transfer. Although, I must say they could add other modes to transfer money as well and the animations could be a bit more immersive. Anyways, I got the amount pretty easily.¬†

Oh yes, another point. There is a referral bonus here, so I sent the link to my brother and when he download the app using this link and played, I got $2 and he got $1. In my opinion, this is the best bit of winzo, their referral amount reflects instantly and you can actually withdraw. I did not, I played another round of Uno.¬†

That said, don‚Äôt expect to get rich playing this, this can be a quick game, a quick buck. You can get your coffee, or perhaps an extra meal with the winnings, but winzo is pretty cool. Just play for fun first, and if you win, it‚Äôs a bonus.

1jphmz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1jphmz3/sanguis_pt_12/,Sanguis [Pt. 1/2],"‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something out there,‚Äù Deputy Erikson said.

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She‚Äôd been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin‚Äô ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he‚Äôll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You‚Äôre more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn‚Äôt bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn‚Äôt have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYounger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn‚Äôt really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy‚Äôs identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs our local law enforcement.‚Äù

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTrying to raise awareness; see if I couldn‚Äôt shake something loose.‚Äù

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there‚Äôd been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor‚Äôs smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren‚Äôt careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone? What made them leave so suddenly?",1,1743573317.0,TheDarkGathering,0,1.0,False

1jphmvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jphmvu/asking_to_meet_because_i_deserve_closure/,Asking to meet because I deserve closure,"I recently made a post about how I  went through a rough breakup. After multiple abusive relationships, this one was felt good... They really did treat me well. They broke up with me in person, however did not give me an explanation. Later they texted me a rather poor explanation (quoted in my last post). 

I feel I deserve more closure and drafted a text explaining that I want to meet once last time and why. Before I send it I'd love any suggestions on how I could improve it, thank you! 

""Hey. If you would be comfortable doing so, I would appreciate if we could meet up over coffee or a bite to eat to talk. To clarify, I have no intention to try to get back together by meeting. After talking through it with some people in an attempt to process, I'm still left feeling confused about the breakup despite your texts trying to explain. I would like to talk through things so I can have a better understanding and receive the closure I deserve.
It is not fair of you to mention that it was more than just your mental health or ""some other little things I thought I'd get over by six months I hadn‚Äôt,"" yet never give me any sort of explanation as to what the hell you meant by that. I'm not perfect, but that doesn't mean I don't deserve to be talked to about what we could improve on? I was your girlfriend. I loved you with my whole heart and soul, so don't you think I ought to get a better explanation? 
I really felt like our relationship was honest and loving, but your explanation over text made it clear you weren't as open with me about how you felt as I had thought. To be completely honest, it also made me feel like I was nothing more than a temporary plaything; fun while it was convenient for you. While I understand that this was likely not your intention, it is how I felt reading your texts, and I do not wish to continue feeling like this. 
I have never been treated as well by a lover as you had treated me, and I truly cherish all of the time we have spent together. You mean so much to me and I really don't want to end things on such a sour note, completely losing you in the process.""

1jphjfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1jphjfy/i_would_appreciate_some_feedback_on_my_first/,I would appreciate some feedback on my first novella chapter.,"The text is called ‚ÄúApples on a Table‚Äù and is a novella in the realistic fiction genre. This work mainly focuses on philosophy and everyday life. It is told through a third person view focused around an old innkeeper of an inn just off of A1A highway in Isla Morada. The story is told through conversations with guests and aims to have discussion on aspects of life and create intriguing dialogue and short stories for them. I hope to get better at writing as different characters and dialects through this so please don‚Äôt judge my first draft too harshly. Thank you. üôè 

Chapter 1
¬†
Off of the scenic highway A1A are many small businesses that have been around for many years. As development comes down from the north and more and more buildings are built on what used to be good beaches. Many people come and many go. Increasing amounts of tourists flood the street and market with their big city cash. For some this is a blessing, for others it is a curse. They bring with them economic prosperity that the locals have not seen, and some feel intimidated. Only adding to this was the prices of goods which slowly rose as more people bought them. Only some were not affected by this rush, some because it simply did not bother them, others because it did not relate to their business.¬†
Unchanged through all of it was a small wooden inn painted in the most Caribbean of colors: a light coral blue. It had white trimming that was surprisingly in very good shape for the age, a roof made of shingles that should have been replaced years ago, and leaks that open into the lobby. But not the rooms, the rooms are kept in tip-top condition, all with a view of the beach from the back window (on both floors). An old man runs the inn. He had been there since before the rush and had just never paid too much attention to it. Hence, he was one of the only who were not affected by it.
¬†
Isla Morada sprung up around him but he still sat on his porch and drank his cup of coffee every morning. Many people came and went through the rooms of the inn. All with stories they just had to tell.

You see, the man had an air of familiarity and of a fatherly presence who you could tell everything to and it would never leave his lips. One day, while setting out the morning breakfast, he left out a tray of apples. A simple action, but it slipped his mind. He never noticed, but many things slipped his mind at his age.¬†

At around noon that day, a motorbike rolled in fast and loud into one of the many open spots in the shell parking lot. The driver hopped off, cursed, checked his tires, clicked his teeth, and then took his helmet off. He was a taller man with a slight limp in his left leg, which caused a slight shift in the way he walked. He left footprints in the shell that were mismatched. The old man chuckled softly at this, hoping not to be discovered. He watched as the man took off his leather jacket and revealed his black, sun-bleached shirt and the belt wrapped tightly around his wrangler jeans. He wore a cap on his head made of a thin fabric that stuck tightly to his head, which was certainly bald or very close.¬†
He walked up the short steps, making the wood creak under him. He opened the door to the screen. Looking toward the old man, he sighed and puffed out his chest. The old man only laughed at him. He had begun to get tired of holding it in and hiding behind his hands. The biker was not pleased, well, nobody would be pleased if you laughed at them. Only would they not be if you laughed with them.¬†

‚ÄúYou the owner?‚Äù A husky voice growled at the old man, making him jump a little. ‚ÄúIf you are then I would appreciate a little service, being this is an inn.‚Äù

‚ÄúStranger, are you southern? I can hear it in your voice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI might be. What does that have to do with you finding me a place to stay the night? Should I yell at you until you can find one?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no, no‚Ä¶ I am sorry but I seem to trod upon simple thoughts sometimes that perhaps aren‚Äôt quite related to what‚Äôs at hand.‚Äù

This time, it was the biker‚Äôs turn to flinch. His hand twitched and his facial muscles contorted for a split second. Being on the earth for as many years as the old man had¬≠¬≠¬≠‚Äîyou learn to read the micro expressions in the face. An understanding washed over the old man. His face softened even more than it had before, sagging in the places where the harsh sun had taken its toll.

‚ÄúYou wanna talk? I‚Äôve been told I make a mean conversationalist back in my dawn years.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to. I just want a place to rest my head old man. Sorry if you don‚Äôt like being called old.‚Äù

The old man just smiled and shook his head. He said softly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind being called old. All sages were old men you know. I take it as people calling me wise.‚Äù He then shrugged slightly, as if to shake off dust that had gathered on him from sitting so long, and proceed to very slowly get up from his chair with the help of the biker.

‚ÄúThank you sonny. I would get up by myself but that might take time you don‚Äôt have.‚Äù He chuckled to himself. ‚ÄúSo, be a dear and excuse me as I show you your room.‚Äù
¬†
The biker nodded, and the old man swept his arm as if to say welcome in. The inside was quite a contrast from the outside. There was a simple light hanging down from the ceiling with a cord that hung just low enough to be a nuisance to the biker, but not the old man. In the corner there was a table with old chairs surrounding it, a cup of coffee still steaming from on the armrest of one, and a newspaper falling off of the other. It smelled of slight mildew but also of that sweet salty smell that the sea breeze often brings on the coast. The floor was a simple wood with a carpet laid over it leading to a semi-grand stairway. The carpet was bright coral blue in color with borders of wavy yellow and white. It was dotted with dingy water marks and contrasting detailed renditions of seashells of all kinds, from sanddollars to conch shells. The more you looked around the more there was to see, but the biker was led to one area. It sat just in front of the stairway at the end of the carpet. The desk was simple but held on it a wooden basket of apples. There were only 9 left in the large basket. They looked so polished and clean that the biker thought that they were fake. 

It was getting to the point in American culture where people did not leave out real fruit anymore as decoration or favors; they preferred plastic because they never had to replace it. So, the biker, assuming the same as many do, did not take one, for fear he may bite into hard plastic instead of the sweet core of an apple.

The old man took his place behind the desk and pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket. These glasses were connected by a long flimsy chain to his pocket to keep them from being lost. His eyes squinted as he pulled a piece of paper and a pen from the one and only drawer.

He then handed both to the biker and said in a professional tone, ‚ÄúSign your name here please.‚Äù So, the biker did. He double checked to make sure that he had written it properly and then handed the paper back over. The old man looked at him incredulously. ‚ÄúAh‚Äîcould I get your signature please? I do think I already asked.‚Äù The biker coughed and tried to hide his face. As one does when they are embarrassed. The old man took the paper back and read over it carefully. He then took his glasses off and smiled at the biker.

‚ÄúBaker Samuels. Did I say it right?‚Äù The old man asked the biker this with a bouncy tone, and the biker‚Äînow known to be called Mr. Samuels‚Äînodded in response.

‚ÄúI used to know a man went by the surname Samuels. He built that fancy resort over there‚Äîback in the 50‚Äôs mind you. I was here first, but he was a nice man, so I let him stay.‚Äù The old man chuckled again. He seemed to be quite amused at himself very often.
‚ÄúWell then, let me show you to where you will rest your head. You know, you don‚Äôt talk so much. I like it, but I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody said you had to like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt very much like that tone of yours, but you paid, so I can‚Äôt just leave you. Here, this way.‚Äù 

He set off walking with a limp to one of the two hallways flanking the staircase. With a sharp turn left he arrived at one of the only two doors. One was marked with a staff only sign, and one had a number on it. 001. The room was light and airy, painted a subtle yellow-grey color to reflect the decorations.
¬†
They consisted of a four-poster bed with muted yellow sheets and white pillows, a dark brown chair in the corner opposite the door, and a large window opening into a view of the beach and the Atlantic Ocean. On the sill sat a small collection of sanddollars and a card which said welcome in big cursive letters on the front. Mr. Samuels walked over and picked up the card, looking at the front before flipping it and seeing a small schedule printed on the back. It read:

7 a.m. Morning coffee and sunrise

8 a.m. Breakfast

9 a.m. Laundry

11 a.m. Early lunch

2 p.m. Newspapers arrive

6 p.m. Dinner

7 p.m. Evening coffee and sunset

‚ÄúAh, is the printing on those hard to read? I had a friend do them for me for cheap.‚Äù 

Mr Samuels simply shook his head and asked, ‚ÄúWhy does the paper come so late?‚Äù

To this question the old man just shook his head. ‚ÄúI think perhaps the delivery route is just too long for one person, so maybe they have shifts. It is a quite tiring job‚ÄîI worked it once. To say that it is a pain to travel on the side of the highway all that distance while carrying the mail would be an understatement. So much news to get out, and not enough time to get it out before new news comes along. It‚Äôs more streamlined these days though. I hear they pay the teenage boys more and that‚Äôs why the papers are delivered faster now.‚Äù

‚Äú2 p.m. is fast for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it used to be 5. So you take what you can get.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ‚Äòspose so.‚Äù

The old man took tiny steps backward as Mr. Samuels examined the room. He finally got to where only his head was peeking from behind the door frame. He smiled widely once Mr. Samuels had turned to face him.

‚ÄúI had better let you settle in. Keep in mind that schedule is mainly built off of mine, and mine never changes, so if you want to talk you should know where to find me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind. I‚Äôll see you later then.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be waiting for you with a cup out on the front porch.‚Äù

Mr. Samuels watched the back of the old man‚Äôs head with its wispy gray hair disappear behind the frame, then walked up to it and shut the door. He flopped onto the bed and almost immediately went limp.
¬†
¬†
¬†
*¬†¬† *¬†¬† *
¬†
¬†
¬†
It was quite a while before Mr. Samuels woke up. The first strokes of yellow had begun to dance across the blue sky and a shelf of clouds just thin enough to still be white were rolling in; turning the yellow into a darker shade of orange. It was early into the sunset, and the bugs were buzzing noisily outside. Mr. Samuels rubbed his eyes for slightly too long and felt the strange hallucinations that come with doing so. Therefore, he had to sit in bed for a second before his eyes cleared up.

He then slowly walked to the door and swung it open; making a creaking sound he was confident enough could even arouse the old man from his sleep. But turns out he would not have to do that. He heard a voice calling to him from outside the open door leading to the screen porch. Figuring he might as well, he walked closer.
Outside was the old man sitting with his back leaning in a chair much too big for him. He was holding a cup. Every once in a while, he would take sips from that cup. Then, after a few moments of silence, he extended his hand with the cup in it.

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù

Mr. Samuels nodded. He took the cup that the old man gestured to with his eyes and sat in the chair next to him. They both settled in to watch as the sun went down.

‚ÄúTell me son‚Äîwhat bothered you so much when you arrived? I saw the twitch in your face; no use hiding it from an old sage as myself. I would like to listen‚Äîand try to help.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis here is hazelnut coffee. I never though I would enjoy it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome now sonny, don‚Äôt try to dodge me. It‚Äôll only make it more difficult when you eventually do decide to tell me.‚Äù

Mr. Samuels took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make you sad old man.‚Äù 

To this the old man rolled his eyes as if to say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard many of sob stories and this couldn‚Äôt be too different.‚Äù This put off Mr. Samuels even more for a reason unknown to the old man. But he continued on anyway.

‚ÄúYou remind me of my father. He was a free soul. Traded his chains of money for a life of travel. Then, one day after he had me, he settled down. As if the settling down had done something to his state, he began to go downhill when I was just a youngin‚Äô. He was never the brightest, but the candle still dripped wax. Then one day, the candle guard started shrinking; nobody could stop it because it wasn‚Äôt needed anymore. My poor mama took him to the doctor. Doctor gave him the mental death sentence. Alzheimer‚Äôs. He would slowly lose touch with reality and memories to the point where he only knew he had kids at some point, not that they were in his lap. So, I watched as I grew older. And I grew up stronger than the other boys because of it. And what do you do when you become strong but don‚Äôt know how to use it? You use it. I once beat a kid so bad his mama had to come pry me off because his daddy was too scared of me. Can you imagine that? From the surprise on your face I imagine you can‚Äôt. Neither could I until I stopped seeing bright red and the tones got darker. I had gotten blood in my eye. I came home that day expecting to see my daddy livid as hell, running out from the house screaming at me with a belt in his hand. He never did come‚Ä¶ excuse me if I start to sniffle a bit. I‚Äôve never really opened this all to strangers. I keep myself wound like a ball and hope the hard exterior of the leather jacket can protect me from the rain, but it can‚Äôt do it forever.‚Äù

The old man was still smiling, although with less enthusiasm now hearing about the tragedy. But he was still smiling because Mr. Samuels had taken the first step to becoming something above the grief you have for a person who has passed on. Many people get caught up in years of residual suffering and constant red eyes and noses. Some never seem to care at all, and others are pragmatic. They think about what they‚Äôre going to do to manipulate people into putting them up so they can make better deals. A silent thanks goes out to those pragmatic thinkers every day.

Mr. Samuels took a moment to look around. He looked at every blade of grass, every shell in the small lot around the tires of his bike. He looked at the old man and saw his face lit by the orange glow of the sunset. For a moment he caught an image. He caught an image of his father, sitting and smiling at the setting sun, watching his life slip away and losing even the awareness of it happening. Tears pooled in his eyes, and he tried to look the furthest away from the old man as he could. He drew a shaky breath.

‚ÄúSay mister, why‚Äôd you build this place on this side, where you can‚Äôt see the sun over the water? I imagine¬≠¬≠, being here so long as you have, that you could have gotten land on the other side.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh well this was cheaper. Plus, I think of it as I can still see the sunset, but also, I can see the people go by everyday and think to myself how luck I am I don‚Äôt have to rush and can sit here and enjoy it.‚Äù

As if to emphasize his point a car sped by with a man in a suit in the front seat. There was a stack of papers on his dash and all four of his windows were closed as to not let them fly out. It was a fleeting incident, but Mr. Samuels could have sworn he saw him eating something. Of course, he was looking ahead at the road and did not have the luxury to look to the right and watch the sun slip into darkness.

The two men sat in silence for a couple minutes until the buzz of crickets started to pick up. The old man said nothing; he did not have to. Mr. Samuels was lost in himself, crying over memories silently in the dark. He took sips of his coffee every now and then and took a couple shaky breaths. Once his coffee had run out, he brought himself back to normal (albeit less aloof and rude now). He got up from his seat, heard the wood floor creak, and looked back towards the road. A passing headlight shined a beam on the old man, lighting up the few teeth he had left in his smile. Then, it passed onto Mr. Samuels, and his puffy eyes and red nose.

‚ÄúThank you for the coffee, it was a good brew. You know I never got your name.‚Äù

‚ÄúSimon. Simon Cedar.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you for your time, Simon.‚Äù
¬†
‚ÄúOf course. If you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôll stay here a bit longer. My coffee isn‚Äôt yet gone. I hope to see you tomorrow morning, Mr. Samuels. Maybe I‚Äôll show you that hotel the guy with your name built.‚Äù

Mr. Samuels let out his first smile since he arrived. It didn‚Äôt fit well on his large and serious face. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you take me in the morning. After we have our coffee.‚Äù 

With that he walked back into the inn, and the old man kept sitting, looking out at the road.

Early the next morning Simon awoke to a quiet house. He went out to drink his morning coffee and sat the whole way through the sunrise. He walked in and over to the only occupied room. He knocked and didn‚Äôt hear a response. He used his master key to unlock it and found it in perfect order, without a soul in sight. He smiled softly to himself as he walked toward the front. Surely enough, the bike was gone.

‚ÄúPoor boy. Must‚Äôve had something come up. Wish he could‚Äôve stayed a little longer; it‚Äôs been a while since I was considered a father.‚Äù

As he opened for the day, nothing had changed except for the new coffee mug upon the table on the porch. Everything was in order, except the desk, for there was something missing. A basket sat upon it. It held 8 apples.",0,1743572927.0,FictionWriting,0,0.5,False

I‚Äôm completely new to this and in all honesty I haven‚Äôt done that much research but I feel like I know the basics. I‚Äôm quite an impulsive person.

Started this to mainly lose weight, but to also overcome tiredness and brain fog. I‚Äôve also got some ear problems at the minute (perforated ear drum) and I‚Äôm hoping this can speed up the healing process.

I‚Äôm tracking my food to make sure I get the right proportion of protein vs fat. Currently working at 60% fat and 40% protein.

I‚Äôve been eating the following

- beef (ground and different types of steaks)
- eggs
- bacon
- cheese (not raw)
- butter (not raw)
- milk (raw)
- coffee beans (ground, using the raw milk)
- honey
- full fat yoghurt.
- honey
-water
-salt

I‚Äôm looking at finding a raw cheese and butter stockist. I had a slight cramp in my foot last night, so going to up my salt intake today. I‚Äôm using pink salt at the moment, but looking at getting some keltic sea salt.

Just have a few questions:

- Am I ok to include the yoghurt/honey or should I eradicate this completely?
- Would you include chicken/fish/lamb
- How does my diet look so far, and critiques or comments?
- Can I drink herbal teas (preferable green tea/peppermint tea
- Should I be calorie counting to lose weight on this? (Seen mixed comments)

I am hitting my 10k steps a day, and have just started the gym (3x weight days and 2 x high intensity cardio)

Any other hints, tips or just general motivation appreciated!! Feel free to link me any inspirational blogs/help websites.

Thank you!

Thank you to everyone in this community for all you do. 

u/likeahuntress - thank you very much for the Arches National Park postcard. I have never been but the design makes it seem so beautiful. I cannot imagine how nice it must be to camp there at night, relax under the stars, and enjoy breathtaking views. I felt very connected with the message you added too.

u/cupcakes_and_canter - thank you for the randomly selected card. I ended up with one celebrating me on my Bat Mitzvah which was quite unexpected, but a welcomed surprise. 

u/CriticismCertain5625 - thank you for the Henry David Thoreau postcard. It was very interesting to read about his life again and the impact of his works such as Walden and Civil Disobedience.

u/lismox42 - thank you very much for the Gates of the Arctic postcard. It's been a dream of mine for years to visit and potentially live in Alaska and this helped keep that dream alive. I 100% agree with you that national parks are a national treasure and must be protected. I also enjoyed hearing about your trip to Yosemite and El Capitan. 

u/remix-sakura - thank you very much for the Alcatraz postcard. I visited San Francisco a couple of years ago and Alcatraz was my favorite part of that visit, so this took me back. Your journey to and from the ferry building was very similar to my own. Glad to hear you also enjoyed In-n-Out, that is genuinely one of my favorite places in the world to eat. 

u/FollowingTheBeat - thank you very much for congratulating me on my accomplishments. Since it's personal I won't talk about it here, but your kind and inspiring words truly meant a lot to me. I definitely needed something like this and am glad to say you helped me deeply.

u/solarkspur - thank you very much for telling me about your trip to Germany. I have never been, but the way you describe it makes it seem like such a lovely place. If I ever visit I would especially like to see the castles just as you did. 

u/TigerLady13 - thank you for the Clark County Museum postcard. I definitely enjoyed hearing about your experience living in Nevada. Your stamp with that day's weather and mood was also a great additional touch. 

u/Kayyrraaaaa - thank you very much for the Princess Mononoke postcard. I actually have tickets to see the IMAX re-release this weekend so this card is absolutely perfect. I am very excited about that and throughly enjoyed your card. You have succeeded in your goal of spreading joy to my little corner of the world. 

u/psychologicalchip589 - thank you for your list of song recommendations in foreign languages. I have definitely enjoyed searching them up and listening to them. Even though I do not understand exactly what they are saying, music has the wonderful ability to connect people between different cultures.

u/C_Strait94 - thank you for telling me about your day. I loved hearing about your peppermint coffee especially, that sounded quite delicious.

u/sammanthax345 - thank you very much for the New York City postcard. I loved hearing all about your trip there and Radio City. I have been to DC (though I never saw the Dream Theater) but have not ever been to NYC. Would definitely love to go if I ever have the opportunity as your trip sounded very fun.

u/melhen16 - thank you for the Dawn Stanyon quote card. I also really enjoyed seeing the fun and cool stamp designs you used on the envelope. My favorite was easily the Skylab one. 

u/Thick-Combination785 - thank you for the butterfly postcard. I thought the quote you included about nevering waiting for the perfect moment as it doesn't exist was a great one. Glad to hear you are doing okay too.

u/Hogwartsismyheart - thank you very much for the Orca postcard. I especially appreciated how you mentioned my love for both aviation and nature. I had no idea about plane design being inspired by beluga whales, so that was very interesting to learn. It meant a lot to mean to hear you wish me luck as I pursue my future goals.

u/nothankyou928 - thank you for allowing me to hear about what's going on in your life. I hope all is well with you and that everything is able to work out nicely. The cute animal stickers you included were also a very nice addition.

5. >!Zed picks Marsellus even though the 'my mother said' bit should've landed on Butch. Zed already knows Marsellus and he was doing the eenie-meenie just for suspense to make it look real. Zed couldn't pick Butch because that would be rape, which is a crime. Zed wouldn't want to commit any crimes. Therefore, Zed is not a rapist.!<

10. >!If Zed didn't rape Marsellus, then why did Marsellus shoot Zed? Marsellus wants to make Butch believe that Zed is a rapist. So he has to make it believable by shooting Zed.

Ever felt like your to-do list starts whispering *evil things* behind your back by midday? üôâ You‚Äôre sitting there, drowning in tasks, sipping on *yet another* lukewarm cup of coffee, and time blocking sounds like the fairy-tale you just can't live up to. I‚Äôve been there, staring at my tragically beautiful, *color-coded* calendar and wondering why I can't fit into this productivity prom dress.

So, if time blocking felt like trying to fit a triangle peg into a round hole (hey, been there, tried that), you‚Äôre going to love this simple twist that breathed some serious efficiency back into my week.

**Here‚Äôs the 10-Second Trick That Saved Me 10 Hours a Week**: üöÄ

>> **The ""2 Minute Reset.""**

Sounds too good to be true, right? But hear me out! Next time you're staring down your task list like it's an angry bull, try this:

**Step 1**: Pick a task. Any task. (Yes, even the one you‚Äôre avoiding like that unread email labeled ‚ÄúURGENT.‚Äù)

**Step 2**: Set a timer for 2 minutes. You have just those 120 seconds to dive in without distractions. Yup, no Instagram, no browsing for the best DIY cat costume. 

**Step 3**: When the timer goes off, ask yourself: ‚ÄúCan I go on for another 5 mins?‚Äù

‚ñ∂Ô∏è If **yes**, congratulate yourself! You‚Äôve *engaged*. Lean into it and keep that momentum rolling.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è If **no**, switch gears. You‚Äôve shaken off the inertia and you can pick up a new task, *now ready for the challenge*.

**Why This Works**: It‚Äôs all about bing-bang-BOOM starting. Ever heard how objects in motion tend to stay in motion? Turns out, that's true for our brains too. Once we get past that initial ‚Äúugh,"" we often end up wrapped in the task. 

Here‚Äôs what makes it perfect for all of us who kinda hate being boxed into any ‚Äúsystem‚Äù:
- **Burst of productivity** without the fancy overhead.
- **Instant action**, no overthinking. 
- **Flexible**‚ÄîIt adapts to everything from cleaning out that dreadful junk drawer to drafting your weekly review.

So fellow MaximizeMe pals, have you ever hit on that magic habit tweak that suddenly made your days feel less like wading through molasses? Share below‚Äîor don‚Äôt, but maybe try the ""2 Minute Reset"" tomorrow morning. Who knows, it might just be the MVP of your week!

I just moved into a new apartment and the master bed room has a terrible dog urine smell (or at least I hope it‚Äôs dog but I know for sure it‚Äôs not cat pee) at first me and my husband thought it was just general dog odor from the previous tenants but after further examination it‚Äôs definitely urine. The carpet in the room is just the standard synthetic brown apartment carpet. 
-
My first attack move was to vacuum the whole carpet very thoroughly (15 minutes) in all directions as slow as possible. Then I put down baking soda all over the carpet and agitated it in there and let it sit for about an hour and then vacuumed that up thoroughly as well. After that I used a Hoover clean slate (mini wet vac carpet cleaner thingy) with water and the Hoover pet odor solution concentrate and saturated a 2ft by 6 ft area (room is small) and then went in with the wet vac
-
I assumed I would be able to do this all in one night but then it hit the 3 am mark and I realized this job was far beyond me. I went over the area a billion times and the water was/is still coffee brown and the carpet still had a urine smell in certain spots. I also noticed that coming up with the water was dog hair and also these tiny, hard black pebbles and when I spread the carpet fibers apart there appeared to be more of these tiny black pebbles attached to the carpet fibers and plastic netting below. So i went back over the area with just water to get the suds out and gave up. I put in a plug in and called it a night. 
-
Tonight I decided that I would just go over it with water and let the water soak for a bit (30 minutes) and then wet vac it. I did that and I‚Äôm not sure if it helped any but by the end the water was starting to be ever so lighter. I also noticed that it smells a billion times worse when it‚Äôs wet. 
-
I put in a maintenance request for them to come help with it but I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre gonna do very little/nothing since I know smells like this are subjective. Like they could just walk in and be like ‚Äúeh it‚Äôs not that bad she‚Äôll adjust‚Äù and dip. So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is what are my options? I can‚Äôt get the rugs replaced since this is a rental and I really don‚Äôt want to rent a carpet dr. bc I have already spent so my money on this apartment and rug but I understand if that‚Äôs my only choice than that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll have to do.

As I look back, I now know that this girl was silently suffering in her Fearful Attached mind, and as I went to go pick up my things last Saturday from her house, I wasn‚Äôt speaking to the person I‚Äôve known for 2years, I don‚Äôt even recognize what I‚Äôve been doing for 2years‚Äî everything feels like a lie, like I‚Äôve been awoken from a dream. We both sabotage, she was always very fearful when I would because she‚Äôd be anxious and get scared of losing me, she‚Äôd comfort me, knew what to say‚Ä¶ walked me out of that darkness, but my sabotage always came with reaction, I‚Äôd get triggered and I could turn nasty, I could weaponize silence and space‚Ä¶ but I also knew that I needed time and space to get myself out of those moments‚Äî she started understanding that‚Ä¶ when she sabotaged it was all about this never working, that her words have been empty lately, one foot in and one foot out, this is going to end one day‚Äî she‚Äôd get squirrelly about moving In, about talking about future plans, pets‚Ä¶ she never wanted kids, she has a belief she‚Äôs non-maternal yet she works with highly functions kids and is amazing at her job. 

Basically this has happened twice in the last month, and there‚Äôs always this grandiose problem‚Äî you know, it‚Äôs been in her mind this problem, and this problem we just haven‚Äôt been able to fix‚Ä¶ okay‚Ä¶ so naturally I‚Äôd ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the problem‚Äù ‚Äî then began a problem I never knew about, one that affected her quite a bit, oh and there‚Äôs another thing‚Ä¶ my girlfriend began to push me away, she began to push our relationship away and I was putting in double the work stressing out, anxiously trying anything for her to just love me, to just return my message with ‚ÄúI love you to‚Äù to hold me and hug me the way I would for her in the kitchen‚Ä¶ but she was suffering, suffering in the idea of her subconscious neglect and the multiple association she has in her life to love, closeness, intimacy‚Äî rejection is her root, she was rejected by her caregivers and she‚Äôs only ever been living in this world to not be seen‚Ä¶ can you imagine that! This women is terrified of being perceived by anyone, she needs to control that narrative or else they might hurt her, perceive her as she doesn‚Äôt want to be‚Ä¶

I was in a frenzy of a state, this was a load of crap dropped on me and she was inconsolable‚Ä¶ I told her that I‚Äôd be by tomorrow to pick my things up from her house, I very angrily returned items she gave me, cards, pictures, crafts‚Ä¶ I cut them up and put it all in a bag for her. Not proud. But it‚Äôs at this point that I‚Äôm not prepared to go another year of my life with someone who hasn‚Äôt been putting in the effort I have, hasn‚Äôt given me the respect of even telling me or considering me when it comes to communicating or giving agency to a problem that is unknown, only she knows about‚Ä¶ I chose painfully to take every part of me out of her life and remove her from mine. I have to protect myself, and I also have to acknowledge that if I can‚Äôt trust your yes, I‚Äôll never be able to trust your no‚Ä¶ 

It kills me to think of the pain I may have caused her, opening that bag, seeing the ripped picture of us, the cut crafts, the notes she wrote that mean nothing to me now, she memories‚Ä¶ but if she were to call me tomorrow would I answer, yes. Why?

I‚Äôm not perfect, and I was not an angel but I wasn‚Äôt a devil‚Ä¶ we hardly fought, we found compromise but it seemingly was just a meaningless compromise, I‚Äôd tell her how beautiful she was all the time, she couldn‚Äôt love herself, I generally think I was a good partner, I think if someone would have been able to come a little further then she was willing to, that we may have worked some great things out‚Ä¶ but I hear all these stories about 6years relationships walking away from them, or abrupt discards for new lovers, cheating‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand how this person wasn‚Äôt building resentment or thinking themselves out of a relationship from the minute they were in one‚Ä¶

And lastly, I know it‚Äôs not her fault, I know it‚Äôs the trauma she endured and it‚Äôs the work she‚Äôll have to put into her life for the rest of her life‚Ä¶ it was very sad to hear her say the future looked bleak, and she didn‚Äôt see one for herself let alone with me, ‚Äúwe‚Äù keep fighting.. no actually you don‚Äôt bring anything to the table or give me a chance to be part of it, if I asked you said your fine‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôve lost 10pounds in 4days, I‚Äôve maybe eaten 1 meal, and I‚Äôve thought my heart was going to come out of my chest multiple times, my jaw is locked and my heart I broken. How did this person do this to me?

I‚Äôm trying to understand what really happened to me.,"I‚Äôm a 37-year-old male (220 lbs, 5'11"", non smoker, drink socially, chronic anxiety, sedentary, resting heart rate 52-55) and experienced some chest discomfort on Thursday night, which I initially dismissed as just another episode of acid reflux. The following morning, I had my usual breakfast of cereal and coffee and went about my day. During a meeting with my supervisor, I suddenly felt a rapid increase in my heart rate. I started feeling dizzy and checked my heart rate‚Äîit was 150 beats per minute. I also experienced a tremor in my chest. I ended the meeting and had my partner drive me to the ER. By the time we arrived, my heart rate had dropped to around 85-90, but then spiked back to 160. My blood pressure upon arrival was 95/145.  That morning, I experienced three similar episodes. The ER ran several tests, but everything came back inconclusive. My Troponin levels were 8, 14, and 12, with a normal ECG and chest X-ray. I was discharged after a few hours with instructions to follow up with my primary care physician, who will arrange for a Holter monitor.

As you can imagine, this whole experience has left me shaken, and I‚Äôm extremely worried about the possibility of having a heart attack. Can anyone help me understand what might have happened?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cooking frozen chicken wings in a slow cooker is a fantastic way to prepare a delicious meal with minimal effort. However, getting that crispy skin can be a challenge. Here are some techniques to help you achieve that coveted crispy skin while cooking your frozen chicken wings in a slow cooker.

### Start with the Right Wings

Choosing the right kind of frozen chicken wings is crucial. Look for wings that are minimally processed and ideally come with skin on. There are many brands available, but organic wings can be a better option for flavor and texture. Avoid wings that are pre-cooked, as they won‚Äôt crisp up well.

### Thawing Process

For best results, consider partially thawing your frozen chicken wings before cooking. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to completely defrost them; just let them sit out for about 30 minutes. This helps to break down some of the ice, allowing seasonings to adhere better and preventing excess water during cooking.

### Use the Right Seasoning

Seasoning your chicken wings is essential for flavor. Here‚Äôs a simple seasoning mix:

- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Mix these spices together and rub them over the wings. Make sure to coat them evenly for the best flavor. Adding a bit of baking powder to your seasoning mix can also help to achieve a crispy texture.

### Layer It Smartly

When placing the wings in the slow cooker, avoid crowding them. Layer them in a way that allows steam to escape. If possible, arrange the wings in a single layer with some space in between each piece. This promotes better air circulation, allowing the skin to crisp up as much as possible.

 *Shop Here Recipes &amp; Crockpots https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *‚Äã  
  
### Add a Cooking Rack** To help keep the wings elevated, consider using a metal rack or trivet inside your slow cooker. Elevating the wings allows the fat to drip away during cooking, preventing them from sitting in their own juices and becoming soggy. If you don‚Äôt have a rack, crumpling up aluminum foil to create makeshift supports can also work.

### Cook on High and Drain

One often overlooked technique is cooking the chicken wings on the highest setting. Set your slow cooker to the high setting for approximately 2-3 hours. After the wings have cooked, carefully drain excess liquid from the slow cooker. This liquid can make the skin soggy. Draining it allows for better skin texture when you finish cooking.

### Finish with Broiling

The final step to achieving crispy skin is to finish the wings under the broiler. Preheat your oven broiler before the wings are done in the slow cooker. Once you‚Äôve drained the liquid, transfer the wings to a baking sheet lined with foil. Place them under the broiler for 5-7 minutes, or until they reach the desired crispiness. Keep an eye on them to avoid burning.

### Experiment with Sauces

If you love flavored wings, you can toss them in your favorite sauce once they are cooked and crispy. Be careful not to use too much sauce, as it can make the skin soggy again. A light coating can elevate the taste while preserving that crispy texture.

By using these techniques, you can enjoy perfectly cooked frozen chicken wings with that irresistible crispy skin, all thanks to your slow cooker. Remember, preparation and proper technique are the keys to getting the best flavors and textures from your meal.

Flavor Profiles and Marinades That Enhance Slow-Cooked Chicken Wings
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to preparing slow-cooked chicken wings, there‚Äôs a world of flavor waiting to be explored. Flames and char are wonderful, but nothing can match the rich, deep flavors that marinating can bring out during the slow cooking process. Choosing the right flavor profiles and marinades can elevate your chicken wings from ordinary to extraordinary.

 *Shop Here Recipes &amp; Crockpots https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *‚Äã** First, consider the basics of a marinade. It usually includes an acid, oil, and a variety of spices or seasonings. The acid, such as vinegar or citrus juice, helps to tenderize the meat while infusing it with flavor. The oil ensures that the spices adhere well and creates a nice mouthfeel. Below are some unique flavor profiles you can experiment with while crafting your marinades:

- **Classic Buffalo**: Start with a base of hot sauce mixed with butter. Add garlic powder, onion powder, and a splash of apple cider vinegar. This potent combination is perfect for those who crave a spicy kick.
- **Sweet and Tangy BBQ**: Combine your favorite BBQ sauce with honey, apple cider vinegar, and a sprinkle of mustard. This marinade achieves balance by mixing sweetness with acidity, perfect for slow cooking.
- **Asian-Inspired**: Use soy sauce as your base and mix in ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and a touch of lime juice. This profile will provide a savory umami flavor, resulting in delicious, sticky wings.
- **Cilantro-Lime Refresh**: Blend fresh lime juice with cilantro, garlic, and a little olive oil. This bright and zesty marinade is fantastic for those who prefer something fresh and light.
- **Herb-Infused Mediterranean**: Mix olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, rosemary, and thyme. This blend adds a fragrant Mediterranean flair to your chicken wings.

While selecting a flavor profile is important, the technique of marinating your chicken wings is equally vital. Here‚Äôs how to do it effectively:

1. **Mix Your Marinade**: Use a bowl or a large zip-top bag. Combine all the marinade ingredients until well-blended.
2. **Add the Chicken**: Place your frozen chicken wings directly into the marinade. If using a bag, ensure to expel as much air as possible before sealing.
3. **Marinate**: Allow the wings to marinate for at least 30 minutes, though overnight is ideal for deeper flavor infusion. If you're using frozen wings, remember they will defrost in the marinade during this time.
4. **Slow Cook**: Transfer the chicken wings with the marinade into your slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 hours or on high for about 3-4 hours, until they‚Äôre cooked through and tender.
5. **Optional Crispy Finish**: If you desire crispy skin, you can place the cooked wings on a baking sheet and broil them for about 5 minutes after slow cooking, ensuring to watch them closely.

Apart from the widely recognized flavors, think outside the box with unique combinations. For example, combining coffee rub with a touch of brown sugar can yield a smoky, sweet, and slightly bitter profile, pushing traditional boundaries. Alternatively, using a fruit-based marinade, such as peach or mango, can complement the richness of the chicken with an unexpected twist.

Thinking about timing? Marinating for longer can provide a deeper flavor penetration; however, be cautious with acidic components like vinegar or lemon juice, as too much time can make the meat mushy. A short duration works wonders with more robust flavors where intensity is key.

You can also consider pairing your wings with unique sides that elevate the meal. Fresh veggies, a zesty coleslaw, or even a classic blue cheese dressing can complement the mouthwatering flavors of your slow-cooked wings.

 *Shop Here Recipes &amp; Crockpots https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *‚Äã** Don‚Äôt hesitate to get creative! Try adding various spices and ingredients, or even infusing your favorite beverages like beer or soda into the marinade. Each attempt can lead to delightful surprises that may become your new go-to recipe.

Slow-cooked chicken wings with rich flavor profiles and marinades are a game-changer in your culinary repertoire. Experimenting with marinades helps you unlock endless possibilities, transforming simple wings into a dish that captivates your taste buds. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and dive into the delightful world of flavor-enhanced chicken wings!

### Conclusion

Making frozen chicken wings in a slow cooker not only saves time but can also result in deliciously crispy skin that elevates your meal to the next level. By employing techniques such as preheating the slow cooker and utilizing a broiler at the end of the cooking process, you can achieve that coveted crunch that delights the senses. Additionally, don‚Äôt underestimate the power of marinades and flavor profiles. Marinating your wings overnight is a game-changer, as it allows the flavors to infuse deeply into the meat, transforming a simple dish into a mouthwatering feast. Whether you prefer zesty buffalo sauce, tangy barbecue, or savory garlic and herbs, the right marinade can completely transform your wings into a gourmet experience.

With these strategies in hand, you can easily impress family and friends or simply enjoy a restaurant-quality meal right at home. Remember to experiment with different seasonings and marinades to find your perfect combination. The versatility of chicken wings means there is truly something for everyone, whether you‚Äôre hosting a game day party or having a casual dinner. Enjoy the journey of cooking, and let your creativity shine in the kitchen. So, gather your ingredients, set up your slow cooker, and get ready to enjoy crispy, flavorful chicken wings that you made yourself!",1,1743570472.0,CrockPot101,0,1.0,False

1jpgwf3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpgwf3,This rock is simply AMAZING,"
So about 10 years ago, in Coffee Creek, California,  my boyfriend was digging a hole for a septic system on his property. When he was about 17 feet down into the ground digging this hole, he noticed this rock, it was quite dirty so he just tossed it out of the hole onto the ground. Later on, he picked it back up, cleaned off all the dirt, and couldn't believe his eyes. There staring back at him was this native American, reaching out in distress. Some people say it is Jesus, but we believe it is a native American, they were very prodominent on where his land now is years ago when this was thier land. This rock came out of the ground exactly like this, that means this rock was ran through that dredge and tossed into those rock piles, somehow finding its way to where it was found . There has been no alterations of any kind, just cleaned. The area where this was found used to be a beautiful pasture, but the gold rush brought white men, who dregded the land and made it nothing but huge rock piles, and then created a huge lake and made a big dam, trinity dam. It looks as though there is blue on the bottom, maybe the lake. We feel as though it's depicting a native American seeing the future of this land and his people (who were massacred). This is something truly and absolutely amazing, and somehow it found its way into our hands, not too long ago our home burned down completely, a total loss, but for some reason he had a feeling to take it to his mother's house right before the fire, somehow he knew to take it out of there.

1jpgwe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1jpgwe2/are_etiquettes_basically_just_peoplepleasing/,Are Etiquettes Basically Just People-Pleasing Techniques?,"I have seen people around getting scolded by old people for not behaving and respecting the way they should be and the way they are taught to. They start questioning out of nowhere, our etiquette and our upbringing, our living standards and every sort of damn thing. 

No hate to senior citizens, this is not what the post is about.

I have seen people around and about questioning how parents don't teach their children how to eat properly. An influencer with a child (1.5 years old) was questioned why she did not teach her child to eat properly without making a mess. 

Parents are also constantly blamed for all such stuff when their kids are small and disrespectful. Asking a kid to do something for you when you are too lazy to do it yourself and blaming it on the parents when they don't do it for you is insane. 

Parents always teach us to respect elders and not be disobedient because what they've learned and what they've seen is to be included in society you should respect others and their opinions, but does that mean we should do everything they say without questioning a thing?

My grandmother, a few days back, asked me to taste something, whether it lacked something, sugar or salt. She couldn't do it herself because she was fasting. I don't like tasting stuff; I mean, in the end, it was my call whether I did it or not, right? I can't even tell if something is missing in the food. She got offended and told me when elders ask you to do something you shouldn't question it and do it even if it is something you don't like. My mother agreed because she did not want to get into another fight with her. When my father came back home that night, she started telling this story to him too. I mean, I can say no to stuff without getting questioned; it's not about etiquette; it's about people pleasing to be included and loved (fake) in society.

Even after all such conditioning into thinking that you agree and do everything you can to not be called upon, I am proud of myself for doing what I think is right in that case. 

Don't get me wrong. If an elderly person asks me for a seat on the bus I will surely give it to them. But what if at the next stop, my grandmother is boarding, and I am saving the seat for her? Please understand that there are a lot of reasons; it's not everything about upbringing and being polite about everything. 

There could be a lot of reasons for not doing a particular thing, it's not always about being polite and understanding in every goddamn situation. This is why females in workplaces just keep their mouths shut even after getting sexually assaulted because of ""log kya sochenge"".

My family judges everyone around for wearing the clothes they wear and for behaving a certain way. Why can't people just accept the fact that not everybody thinks alike, and what you think is right might be considered illogical behaviour by someone else?

I saw this post somewhere on Instagram where a dad and his son play this car game every time they go out. They don't get angry at people for behaving a certain way in traffic, they just think of reasons why they are behaving like that (positive). Like if a person is honking a lot and is cutting lanes, maybe he was late to an interview because while having coffee he spilt it on his shirt and had to change. It's a guessing game, and I liked the way they thought. 

What do you people think about this?

I'm so passionate about this whole topic of freelancing and online business and high-ticket services and personal branding and all that. I could write about it in my sleep.

# Job description

**Blog Writer Needed for Women-Focused Business Agency ‚Äì Authentic Voice, Strong Storytelling**

Are you a talented writer with a passion for storytelling, a knack for research, and a love for all things business + branding? Our agency is looking for a blog writer who can bring an authentic, human tone to content that speaks directly to ambitious women building high-ticket service-based businesses.  
  
What We Do:  
We help freelancers, entrepreneurs, and service providers (mostly women) build and scale premium, high-ticket offers. Our voice is smart, bold, inspiring ‚Äî and never robotic or generic.  
  
üìù What You‚Äôll Be Writing:  
Long-form blogs that blend storytelling with insight  
Thought-leadership pieces comparing our agency to competitors in the market (your first assignment)  
Content that educates, empowers, and resonates with women in business  
Market-researched blogs with strong intros, clean structure, and an engaging flow  
üîç What We‚Äôre Looking For:  
Strong research skills ‚Äì you know how to gather insight from competitors and turn it into compelling content  
An authentic, conversational writing style (think: talking to your smartest friend over coffee)  
Impeccable grammar, spelling, and flow  
Great storytelling instincts ‚Äì you can hook a reader and carry them through an idea  
A genuine understanding of our target audience: ambitious women entrepreneurs  
A portfolio of previous work that shows your voice and writing range  
üí¨ To Apply:  
Please write two sample paragraphs on this prompt:  
  
Women are dominating the business world, launching more businesses than men.  
Write from your own perspective, backed by facts or stats. Make it real, make it resonate, and show us your voice.  
We‚Äôre not looking for perfection ‚Äî we‚Äôre looking for personality, clarity, and flow. Show us you can connect.  
  
If this sounds like your kind of project, we‚Äôd love to hear from you!  
Let‚Äôs make content that doesn‚Äôt just fill space ‚Äî but builds a brand. \*If everything goes well, we would like to hire three people full time  
  
\*Price is non-negotiable

# Questions

1. Have you written blog content for a brand, agency, or entrepreneur before? If yes, please provide a link or attach a sample.
2. What experience do you have writing for a female or women-centered audience? How do you approach voice, tone, and relatability?
3. What industries or niches are you most confident writing in? (Bonus if you‚Äôve written about business, marketing, freelancing, or women in leadership.)
4. How do you ensure your writing sounds human and not AI-generated?
5. Are you comfortable receiving feedback and making revisions based on voice, tone, or direction?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I really like the sound of all of this. This sounds great for me. Except...

**The pay is a fixed rate of $15.** And ""price is non-negotiable,"" she says.

And her average hourly rate paid is just $4.78 per hour! Wow, what a surprise. üôÑ

In general, I get annoyed by clients like this who have such high expectations and low budgets, but what makes me so angry about this particular client is the fact that her whole business is about helping entrepreneurs create and sell high-ticket offers. My blood boils whenever I see clients whose businesses are all about teaching people how to make money and yet they're not willing to pay their freelancers a high rate!! Don't tell me how you supposedly care about empowering women and high-ticket offers and all that, when you don't want to pay high rates!! How can you teach women how to charge high rates for their services when you won't pay high rates? You won't even pay $5 an hour?!?!?!

**You don't really believe what you teach. And that's what makes me mad.** You don't believe in women being successful and raising their prices. You don't want the freelancers you hire to be successful. You just want to pay the cheapest rates possible so that you can keep more money for yourself.

Oh and I'm sure you're telling yourself some story about *""they're from such-and-such country, so it's okay!!!""* I'm sorry, why aren't people from such-and-such country allowed to have high-ticket services??? I thought you cared about helping entrepreneurs succeed. But you don't.

I actually care about this stuff and am inspired by women who built online businesses that grew successfully. This topic is inspiring to me and means a lot to me and I hate the fact that this person doesn't take it seriously.",0,1743569177.0,Upwork,4,0.38,False

My friends and I would meet at a coffee shop and by the window I would just go off telling them to imagine a Celica was parked up front. Later that year that dream became reality. It was my first ever car purchase, and I had been driving an '03 Camry but that one stayed with the family. My Celica is a base model, but it is a 5spd and taught me how to drive stick. It is also incredibly simple and is teaching me how to wrench on my own car.

I have received trade offers, funnily enough both Nissan Zs (300ZX, 350Z). I have considered other cars from time to time (I have driven the MR2 and SC400 shown in image 1, an IS300, and looked at 5th Gen Celicas and a 1st Gen Porsche Boxster), but despite all of that I know I would regret trading or selling THIS Celica. This car saw my first girlfriend, taught her to drive stick on our first date... This car was the model my dad passed up buying in '94, and he has secretly wanted one ever since. This car was given to me by a family of Toyota collectors ~500mi/805km away who had given me the chance to have my first fun car, when their neighbors were right next door cash in hand. 

The Celica has given me so many wonderful memories. Reflecting on it rekindles my passion for the car, and driving it feels as heavenly as it did since day one.

He never asks for a girl's number!"" Hannah squealed as she jumped onto the end of Fran's bed, a grin on her pretty face. ""Although he never normally has to.""
""Yes, such a crush he didn't even notice it was me. No offense Han, but he is pretty dumb,"" Fran joked, shaking her head and pretending to focus back on her coursework.
""It's because you have those glasses on again! I told you they covered half of your face and not to mention you hid your face with a book as he came into the room!"" Hannah laughed, noticing how uncomfortable Fran was.
""Han, just let it drop, ok? I must focus on my work. You said to yourself that your brother is a playboy.""
""Here, this is perfect,"" Hannah said as she threw Fran one of her dresses.
Fran had only known Hannah a couple of months since they had moved in together as roommates. Yet, they had already become good friends.
Hannah had promised to dress Fran up tonight and in her words, 'make every guy at the party want her.' Fran didn't bother to tell her that it was impossible.
Fran's hair was a dull brown, the same as her eyes, which she usually hid with her chunky glasses even though she had boxes of contact lenses.
The dress Hannah gave her was out of her comfort zone. Red was too much a bold color for someone as shy as Fran.
""I can't wear this Han, it's far too flashy.""
Fran looked in the mirror, frowning.
""You're wearing it, end of conversation! Come and sit here, I need to do your hair!"" Fran followed her friend's order.
After a full hour of Hannah messing with Fran's hair and face, it was time to leave. Fran's hair was long and loosely curled, a style she'd never have been able to do herself. Although most of her makeup was light, the lipstick was the same striking red as the tight dress.
""I know I'm great! You can thank me later. I will accept payment in the form of takeout pizza tomorrow,"" Hannah grinned at Fran in the mirror's reflection.
Hannah herself didn't need to do much to her appearance, she was beautiful already. Her long blonde hair fell to her slim waist, and her eyes were bright blue. She didn't need to wear makeup, but she seemed to believe otherwise.
""Let's get out of here!"" Fran grabbed the purse Hannah had borrowed her and threw in the lipstick with money and keys. She was ready to go to her first college party.
When they pulled up outside of the large house, Fran started to feel nervous. She hadn't been to a wild college party before, tonight that would change.
The party was being thrown by the most popular guys on campus at their frat house.
Hannah had begged Fran to go with her, so she obliged. When they stepped out of the taxi, there were drink cans all over the garden with a guy and girl bussing on the grass.
Fran about already felt uncomfortable, and they weren't inside yet.
Hannah pushed open the door, and they entered what should have been the lounge. It was currently being used as a dance floor. The music was deafening and seemed to be some heavy dance song.
Looking around, Fran noticed most of the people here were older than her and Hannah.
As her eyes reached a couch in the far corner of the room, she spotted a guy with two beautiful girls sat on each of his legs. His hair was light brown, the same as the stubble on his jaw. Fran could just about see his fitted white shirt and black jeans under the two girls sprawled across him.
He looked her up and down. ""Fran, please tell me you are not checking out my brother?"" Hannah waved her hand in front of Fran's face before crossing her arms. ""I love him, but he is also the biggest player here. You need to stay away from him. Let's go and get a drink come on,"" Hannah took Fran by the hand and led her toward the large kitchen where every countertop was littered with drink and red cups.
They didn't look alike, yet, how could she really tell from across the room? He did look like the kind of guy Fran should stay away from. He already had two girls on his lap to choose from.
Hannah grabbed a drink bottle from a cupboard and poured them both a shot. Fran took it and poured the burning liquid down her throat and she almost threw it back up. Hannah passed her a red cocktail, and Fran somehow managed to keep the foul shot down.
As Hannah led her back into the lounge, Fran felt lightheaded from the drink. Hannah stopped in the middle of the crowd of dancing bodies and immediately started moving. Fran never usually danced in public, but she did enjoy it a lot, and with the drink in her system, she had new-found courage.
""A girl in red, I like it,"" a big jock said as he grabbed her hip, and Fran attempted to push him away.
""Simon, leave her alone, you jerk.""
The giant seemed to listen to Hannah, which surprised Fran.
""He's my brother's friend, he's also scared of him,"" Hannah shrugged and carried on dancing.
Fran couldn't help but look back at the couch where Hannah's brother sat. He was staring directly at her, his eyes never leaving her own. The two blondes were no longer sitting on him, instead trying desperately to get his attention from either side of him. He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and head slightly lowered.
Fran felt awkward as his eyes slowly looked her up and down. She decided to head to the toilet, feeling uncomfortable with him watching her. Fran told Hannah she would be back in a moment, and Hannah carried on happily dancing with two girls Fran had never met.
Walking up the stairs, the music became quieter and was replaced with a woman's voice. Fran knew face would be red, and she had no idea where the toilet was. The last thing she wanted to do was walk in on two strangers going at it. The upstairs held six different corridors and Fran stood confused as to which way the toilet was.
""Are you lost?""
The voice was masculine and low, Fran felt something deep inside of her. She turned resting her back against the wall to see who had spoken. The man pressed both his hands against the wall behind her, caging her in.
""If you're looking for something a little more fun than the party, my room's down there, or we could do it here if you're feeling brave,"" he said, his piercing blue eyes bright in the dimly lit corridor.
Fran blushed and pushed him away. No way was she doing anything with the college playboy, especially as he was her friend's brother.
""You're seriously pushing me away?"" He raised an eyebrow as Fran stepped back. ""I'm guessing Hannah said to stay away. Don't worry, this can be our little secret,"" he said with a charming grin that revealed perfect white teeth.
""No thanks. Can you tell me where the toilet is, please?"" She stuttered like an idiot. He noticed her hesitation, and his smile grew wider.
""Come with me, I'll show you.""
He took her hand into his own and led her down the corridor to the farthest door.
Inside, the walls were painted dark grey with matching furniture and a giant Television on the wall. When Fran heard the door close behind her she pulled away, worried that he was going to try something.
""Do you seriously think I need to force a girl sleep with me?"" He asked, crossing his muscular arms over him, ""someone had vomited on the communal toilet floor so I'm going to let you use mine, ok? It's the door on the left.""
Fran nodded and quickly rushed into the other room and shut the door behind her. She had no idea why, but her heart was racing, and her skin felt damp. It could have been the drink, she suspected it was more to do with the handsome guy behind the door.
After quickly using his bathroom Fran was keen to get away from him. He was an expert with women, and she was clueless with men. She opened the door to see him lying on the bed his arms behind his head. His white t-shirt was slightly pulled up revealing part of his toned stomach.
Fran gulped and tried to focus.
""Thanks for letting me use your bathroom. I'll be going then,"" Fran mumbled and made her way to the door. Conrad was quick to block the exit.
""Leaving so soon? Do I get to know your name? Maybe your number?"" He looked down at her. His eyes were a lighter shade of blue than Hannah's. Why was she looking in his eyes? She needed to focus and get out of his bedroom.
""No. Can I please go?"" Fran looked behind him, hoping he'd give up and leave her alone. Much to her relief he stepped to the side and let her pass. As she made her way down the corridor, she heard him shout from behind her.
""I'll see you soon, and I will find out your name,"" he mischievously grinned before winking, then shut the door behind him.
As much as she hoped he would stay away from her, it was kind of nice to have the attention. But he was off-limits. She knew a guy like him would break her heart, and it wasn't worth ruining her friendship with Hannah.
It didn't take long to force a drunk Hannah to leave, they got a cab back to the dorms, and Hannah went straight to sleep. Fran couldn't stop thinking about her friend's brother and his last comment.
He wouldn't find out her name, he had probably found someone else to take to his bed already.
When Fran woke up, she felt terrible. Although she hadn't been drunk the previous night, she still had a headache and felt like she needed to drink a whole swimming pool of fresh water. She groaned as she got out of the bed, making her way to the coffee machine that Hannah had set up on her side of the room and made them both one each. Hannah was still fast asleep looking comfortable.
She decided to have a lazy day and get into her baggy hoody and joggers. Not the best fashion choice, but Fran preferred her comfort.
When Hannah woke up, she had a big grin on her face.
Where was her hangover? Fran thought jealously.
""Morning, Fran! Yay, you made me a coffee! Seriously? You're studying? Again?"" Hannah exclaimed as she practically jumped out of bed and opened the curtains.
Fran smiled as she put her books down on the bed and plugged her laptop in.
""You should be studying too, you've not done any work since we became roommates,"" Fran said in a disapproving tone just as there was a loud knock at the door.
Both girls turned to look at the door where someone was persistently banging.
""Who is that,"" Hannah said as the door kept banging ""Sheez! I'm coming shut up!""
Hannah pulled the door open, and there he was.
He looked more attractive today than Fran remembered. In a leather jacket with a white t-shirt and black jeans, he reminded her of the men in the vintage Hollywood movies her mother loved so much. It was a lot lighter here in the bedroom than it had been last night at the party, and Fran could see his bright blue eyes as he focused on his sister.
Fran put a book in front of her face and pretended to read. She found the whole situation way too awkward.
""God, you didn't need to break the door down. What do you want?"" Hannah asked as Conrad followed her into the bedroom.
""Where is your friend from last night? The hot brunette in the red dress?"" He asked as he stared at Hannah.
Did he seriously not recognize Fran? Or was he talking about somebody else?
Fran knew she looked different with her hair still wet, and she had her chunky glasses on, but surely, he wasn't that dumb.
Hannah looked over at Fran then smirked back at her brother.
""And why do you care? Did something happen last night?"" She cocked her eyebrow up at him, clearly amused at his stupidity.
""Don't mess me around, Hannah. Who is she?""
""She doesn't come to this college. Sorry, bro. It looks like you missed your chance at using her like all of my other friends.""
""Give me her number Han. I'm serious!"" He looked angry, crossing his arms in front of his broad chest.
""You like her, don't you? Why? Didn't she hop straight into bed with you like everyone else?"" Hannah frowned at her brother as he started to blush, ""no way, Conrad, you're not going there ok?""
""Fine. Forget it,"" Conrad replied.
Hannah was about to say more when he stormed out of the room and slammed the door behind him.
""Ah! My brother totally has a crush on you! He never asks for a girl's number!"" Hannah squealed as she jumped onto the end of Fran's bed, a grin on her pretty face. ""Although he never normally has to.""
""Yes, such a crush he didn't even notice it was me. No offense Han but he is pretty dumb,"" Fran joked, shaking her head and pretending to focus back on her coursework.
""It's because you have those glasses on again! I told you they cover half of your face and not to mention you hid your face with a book as he came in the room!"" Hannah laughed, noticing how uncomfortable Fran was.
""Han, just let it drop, ok? I must focus on my work. You said it yourself that your brother is a playboy.""
Hannah frowned while looking at her.
""You're right, I did, and I still stick to that. It's probably best we don't tell Conrad who you are...But there is another party next weekend at his house and promise I won't get too drunk if you come?"" Hannah smiled at Fran, the desperation evident in her question.
""I don't know Han, I shouldn't be out every weekend partying I need some time to study and---""
""Yay, I'm so glad you're coming! Another makeover for you,"" Hannah rushed the words out before Fran could decline, ""anyway, I'm going to shower and then study with you, ok?"" And with that, Hannah grabbed her towel and skipped into the bathroom.
A few hours later after promising herself that she wasn't going to the party, she was with Hannah straightening her hair.
As much as she didn't want to go, it was nice having someone glam her up and having girl time with someone. This was something Fran had never done and never thought she would do, despite how much as she secretly wanted to.
""Thanks, Han you really don't have to do this you know,"" Fran said as she took more of her hair between the metal plates. Fran started to feel bad that this friendship was a bit one sided. With Hannah letting her use her things and dressing her up, whilst Fran helped Hannah study seemed a bit unfair.
""Hey, don't thank me, it's nice to have someone to get ready with for a change, you know I never really had a true friend"", Hannah said smiling sadly behind Fran.
It seemed unlikely that someone as outgoing as Hannah had never had a group of friends or at least a best friend. Fran knew why she'd struggled to make friends, she was shy and admittedly slightly weird by most people's standards.
Hannah must have noticed Fran's confused expression.
""Girls never made friends with me because they liked me. A lot just used me just to get closer to my brother and once he'd use them they'd never speak to me again, he claimed he was helping me out getting rid of all the users,"" Hannah frowned, ""and the rest liked being friends with a rich millionaire's daughter,"" Fran had no idea Hannah was the daughter of a millionaire, not that it mattered, it wasn't as if Hannah showed off her wealth.
""You're the only one who made friends with me not knowing who my dad or brother are and it's nice. And when Conrad tried it on you said no to him,"" Hannah smiled at Fran in the mirror as she finished the last strand of her hair.
""I know how you feel. Well not about having people use me just because of who I know, but not having any real friends. No one wanted to be friends with the weird nerd,"" she laughed as Hannah passed her some pink lipstick.
""Well now we have each other so let's go show everyone at this party what a hesitation nerd you can be,"" Hannah grinned picking out a dress for Fran to wear.
Fran looked completely different from last week, yet, surprisingly as good. Her hair was dark sleek and shiny, falling beneath her chest with dark eye makeup and pink gloss. Again, the dress was a bit out of her comfort zone, being black tight and low cut, but it did look good and matched well with the black strapped heels.
Hannah looked beautiful in a blue skater style dress that matched her eye color with her blonde hair curled.
""Now time for pre-drinks!"" Hannah passed Fran a glass of what looked like coke but tasted like bleach. Fran swigged it back as it left a sharp burning feeling in her throat.
""Are you trying to kill me!"" Fran said as Hannah laughed.
""No, I just thought it was your turn to be the drunk one,"" Hannah left her own full glass on the dressing table and called the taxi.
The party was in full swing and Fran was feeling light headed. Hannah had given her more drinks the second they got in the house and Fran decided to go along with it. She wanted to let go for a change and enjoy herself.
Also, there was no sign of Conrad, meaning Fran could enjoy herself without worrying he would be watching her. Not that she cared what he thought, of course.
They were both dancing and Fran was having so much fun. Hannah grabbed Fran by the hand and pulled her into the center of the crowd. Hannah's attempt at not getting drunk hadn't worked as she was not far drunker than Fran.
Fran was happy to keep an eye on Hannah and not drink any more drink herself anyway.
Music played loudly over the speaker as Fran and Hannah danced in the center of the room. A couple of good looking older guys danced behind them but neither of them cared, both having too much fun.
Fran closed her eyes just enjoying the moment letting the music control her when suddenly a firm arm grabbed her around the waist pulling her away from the crowded room.
She turned to see who was marching her out the room, surprised to see it was Conrad. He looked ahead, not showing emotion on his face as he slightly tensed his defined jaw. Fran turned to see another guy with Hannah behind them, Fran assumed was Conrad's friend.
""What! Where are we going! Let go of my arm! I was having fun!"" They were almost outside of his bedroom when Conrad turned around, leaning forward to look her in the eyes.
""Fun? You think getting my little sister to dance like some trashy bimbo in front of the biggest players in college is fun?"" He shook his head as Fran stepped away from him. He invaded her personal space, stepping closer toward her as Fran stumbled into the wall behind her. She was actually feeling intimidated; he was after all over 6ft compared to her 5'4.
""Listen, Fran. You might be a girl who likes to dance up guys at parties, but my baby sister is not! Stay away from her!""
""How dare you say something like that to me,"" Fran said forgetting her previous fear, no one talked to her that way and called her a bimbo.
""You know for someone who is a complete bimbo themselves, you sure act high and mighty! You were happy enough to try and sleep with me last week and I was the one who said no to you! And guess what? I'm a maiden! So, I will stay friends with Hannah and you won't stop---
As Fran tried to finish her rant, Conrad pushed his finger against her lips to silence her.
""You're a maiden? I didn't realize,"" he said stepping away from her.
Fran had no intention of telling him about her none existent private life yet there she was, shouting it out in the corridor.
""Where is Hannah? I want to go home,"" She said trying to change the conversation. He smirked but didn't ask again, thankfully.
""She is staying across the hall from me tonight, there is no way is she heading back to her dorm in that state. My friend Jax has given up his room for her, the three of us have been friends since we were kids,"" he said pointing towards the door where she must have been staying,
Well, at least Fran knew she would be safe, she decided to head downstairs and leave. As she walked down the corridor she was stopped.
""What are you doing. You're not leaving here alone,"" Conrad told her as he firmly put his hand around her waist, pulling her into his strong chest. He smelt faintly of aftershave and soap, Fran rather liked it.
""Going home, obviously. Don't worry."" Fran said angrily, she pulled her wrist back with no luck.
""There is absolutely no way that is going to happen. Do you know how dangerous it is to go home alone? You can stay in my room tonight,"" he said.

She wakes, as she does every day‚Äîbathed in sunlight and shadow. Her eyes open to the gentle hum of the machines outside, collecting water and power alike.

Her morning routine is a reminder: that she is alive, that she has meaning, that she can create her own peace. Light yoga first, to shake off the cobwebs from dreaming. Then, shower, dress, teeth, face, and signature scent. Finally, the worst part of the morning: coffee or tea?

After a quick breakfast of yogurt, fruit, toast, and juice (she still couldn‚Äôt choose between the two hot beverages), it was time for the best part of her day. It was time to walk to the garden and greet the bugs, the birds, the trees, and the fairies.

Her husband didn‚Äôt believe in the fairfolk, but she knew better. She knew if you listened hard enough, you could hear them whisper jokes and giggle brightly. It didn‚Äôt matter if he believed. He loved her and everything she loved. So he‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄúHow are the fairies today? They tell you any secrets yet?‚Äù

Dumbass. Love him. Of course they did.

This morning, the fairies had left her a gift. Not an acorn hat or a bit of moss shaped like a heart‚Äîthough those were common offerings. No, this morning it was a ring of perfectly spiraled snail shells circling the base of the lavender bush. She crouched, careful not to disturb the pattern, and whispered her thanks in the old way‚Äîsoft and steady, as if the wind might carry her voice through the world.

The breeze shifted. A laugh? Or leaves brushing each other? Hard to say. But the garden shimmered that little shimmer it sometimes did‚Äîlike it knew something she didn‚Äôt.

She stood and breathed it all in: the smell of damp soil and citrus blossoms. The sense that something important might happen today, if she just paid close enough attention.

And so, barefoot still and mug in hand, she padded back inside, letting the screen door sigh behind her.
‚ÄúThey left me a message,‚Äù she said, leaning against the kitchen counter.

Her husband, half-buried in newsfeeds and spreadsheets, looked up. ‚ÄúOh yeah? What‚Äôs the gossip?‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúThey said to pack a lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, an adventure for you?‚Äù he asked, looking back to his articles.

‚ÄúAn adventure for us,‚Äù she mused.

They packed a meal for a day of walking, searching‚Äînot knowing what they‚Äôd find, but knowing it wouldn‚Äôt matter, as long as they hunted together.

She put on her favorite sun hat‚Äîan obnoxious thing to some, being too wide and covered in hand-sewn patches‚Äîbut it was hers. She took her husband by the arm, kissed his cheek, and they stepped through the threshold of their front door.

The air was thick with flowers and promises. Their sky sails floated high above, singing pleasantly‚Äîalmost the faint sound of cicadas in summer. They walked the edge of the garden, stopping to say good morning to the passing honeybee and snail, before continuing to the beaten path just past their last crops.

It was a trail they‚Äôd walked many times before, always with reverence and ceremony. It curved and bent organically up a hill, ending at the base of an ancient oak overlooking the whole valley unfolding below. On a clear enough day, you could even see the domed city on the far side of the farmland.

They took their time‚Äîof course they did. There was no rush on a day gifted by the fairfolk.

Halfway up the trail, she paused to brush her fingers against a swaying stalk of golden grass.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching today,‚Äù she said.

He followed her gaze, pretending not to see the tiny shimmer just beyond the veil of leaves.
‚ÄúHope they brought popcorn,‚Äù he replied.

She snorted, and the wind answered with a swirl of petals that danced between them before vanishing into the brush.

When they reached the ancient oak, they sat without a word. Not out of solemnity, but out of that rare and holy kind of comfort‚Äîthe kind that doesn‚Äôt need filling. The valley below stretched like a story waiting to be told. Farms pulsed in rhythm. Wind petals turned lazily on distant turbines. Somewhere near the domed city, a caravan of walkers traced bright banners behind them, weaving color through the patchwork green.

Then she saw it.

Near the roots of the oak, almost hidden beneath a fold of moss, was a door. No taller than a loaf of bread, made of bark and quartz and time.

‚ÄúWell damn,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey really do want us to come.‚Äù

He leaned in beside her, raising a brow.
‚ÄúI guess I should‚Äôve packed three apples.‚Äù

She reached for the tiny handle. It wasn‚Äôt locked. It wasn‚Äôt heavy. It just was.

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù she asked.

He took her hand.
‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

My partner who is half Spanish has affectionately called me ‚Äúamor de mi vida‚Äù or ‚Äúlove of my life‚Äù affectionately for the past year of our relationship (been together three). There are a few romantic phrases he says to me in Spanish that make me feel very special and loved and this is one of them. 

Yesterday I met my meta (of a little under a year) one on one for the first time. We had a walk and a coffee and sent our shared partner a smiling picture, which made him very happy because there have been ups and downs our relationships since he started seeing this meta, so us (meta and I) warming up to each other comes as a great relief.

Later at home he was gushing about receiving that picture and casually said to me something along the lines of ‚Äúhow happy I was to see the loves of my life happy together‚Äù and I got hit with a wave of discomfort. I‚Äôd never heard him refer to her that way, with the words he uses for me. 

I brushed it off as best I could but it‚Äôs gnawing on me. These are the little splinters that really sting me when getting used to the poly dynamic - objectively, it makes sense that he would refer to us both this way, we are both important parts of his life and I can reason that after 8 months or so he might feel like referring to her that way. That‚Äôs the deal, multiple life loves, poly-amory. And yet I‚Äôm wounded anyway. Maybe because it took him a while to say that to me, and now I‚Äôm imagining him throwing it out casually to her for however long.

I've read a lot on this page and I know some people have found it helps while others say it makes it worse. When I first started exhibiting bad symptoms I was working overnights (which was a new schedule for me) and I was working in an ER so it was pretty high stress. When the symptoms started getting really bad I thought it was just caffiene and the combo with night shift and ER stress. I completely cut out caffiene then (and this is from someone who could drink 5-6 cups of coffee and energy drinks without any issue). It took me roughly 8-9 months to get diagnosed and I'm now on new meds that have helped tremendously (midodrine and propranolol 3 times daily). I still have bad days and when I am over stressed or over exert myself it takes a long time for me to get back to my baseline but I kind of want to try caffiene again but I'm afraid it'll bring on worse symptoms. I'm currently in nursing school, I ended up having to quit my job because of the pots but so far I've been able to manage school pretty well but there are times where I desperately want a cup of coffee. I'm not looking to have any excessive amounts of caffiene now (nothing compared to what I used to) but I'd like to try like a regular coffee every now and then without feeling like I'm going to die. 

Anyway this ended up being a bit longer than I thought it would, if you've read this far and have any advice or have had similar experiences I'd love to hear it. I'm pretty much open to anything at this point ",1,1743567647.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

What‚Äôre the benefits of a ‚Äúregular‚Äù store vs a license store? 

The license store is only 2.5 miles from my house, pays 75¬¢ more per hour & is only open 5:30am-5pm M-F. I‚Äôm not sure of *all* the benefits. I feel as though the growth wouldn‚Äôt be as much here though. 

‚ÄúRegular‚Äù store I know you get the free food & drinks, free pound of coffee, Spotify, ASU‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about 8ish miles from my house. So still not bad. 

I‚Äôm trying to compare the pros and cons of each. 

Obviously the M-F & more money is really enticing. I‚Äôm just trying to see if the benefits of a regular store outweigh this one. 

Any insight would be awesome! Especially if you‚Äôve worked for a hospital license store before! ü•∞

The idea is for it to be a seating area and coffee and tea bar

Nothing has to stay. Exterior door included.

Room is 15 x 13.5, with a bathroom that is 8 x 4.5. 
The cabinet layout in the floor plan is not quite accurate as there is another cabinet on the right of the fridge, but fairly close.
counters are 26"" deep. Longer counter is 8 ft, shorter is just over 4 ft.

My thought is to take the upper cabinets out, and replace with a mix of large scale artwork and some open shelving. They are too tall to be used for storage and we do not need that much storage.

Wainscoting and maybe some equestrian themed wall-paper on one wall.
Wall color first choice at the moment is Farrow and Ball Schoolhouse White, and then either Green Smoke or Card Room Green for the cabinets.
Two toned with wainscoting or do all the white color and leave the cabinets as the color. All advice and suggestions appreciated!!",1,1743567565.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

I don't know how many times I'm supposed to go to popular evening spots like UpDown or Tilt, music venues like 331 or 7th St, coffee shops with 15 minute lines like Backstory and Silver Fern, or how long I'm supposed to linger in a record store. Same whenever I venture over to St Paul. Likewise, they're nowhere during my routine weekday: none in the grocery stores, very very rarely at work, and certainly almost never on the bus or train. 


Contrasted against cities where there's always stuff going on with actually busy sidewalks as the daily baseline and streets crammed with all sorts of destinations, It's nearly impossible to run into other mutually attractive gay guys just by going out and about. Here, the windows for meeting someone like that are too narrow and if the bar/hookup scene isn't your thing, well, I have to deduce that it's nearly everyone else's thing. I looked for bookclubs but all that came up were lesbian or trans ones and other meetups are on the other side of the metro during weeknights or only monthly and I just missed it. Even when I go for a solitary walk in the fresh snow in one of the parks along the lake or creek they're not there either. 


Maybe I'm not paying enough attention when I should? Crossing paths regularly just doesn't happen here while it does in other more urban cities. I try to just do my thing, but it's hard not to feel like going out is an exercise in being alone in public. What's the secret everyone else knows? Moving aside.

If you are at first lonely, be patient.

If you've not been alone much, or if when you were, you weren't okay with it, then just wait. You'll find it's fine to be alone once you're embracing it.

We can start with the acceptable places, the bathroom, the coffee shop, the library, where you can stall and read the paper, where you can get your caffeine fix and sit and stay there. Where you can browse the stacks and smell the books; you're not supposed to talk much anyway so it's safe there.

There is also the gym, if you're shy, you can hang out with yourself and mirrors, you can put headphones in.

Then there's public transportation, because we all gotta go places.

And there's prayer and mediation, no one will think less if your hanging with your breath seeking peace and salvation.

Start simple. Things you may have previously avoided based on your avoid being alone principles.

The lunch counter, where you will be surrounded by ""chow downers"", employees who only have an hour and their spouses work across town, and they, like you, will be alone.

Resist the urge to hang out with your cell phone.

When you are comfortable with ""eat lunch and run"", take yourself out for dinner; a restaurant with linen and Silverware. You're no less an intriguing a person when you are eating solo desert and cleaning the whip cream from the dish with your finger. In fact, some people at full tables will wish they were where you were.

Go to the movies. Where it's dark and soothing, alone in your seat amidst a fleeting community.

And then take yourself out dancing, to a club where no one knows you, stand on the outside of the floor until the lights convince you more and more and the music shows you. Dance like no one's watching because they're probably not. And if they are, assume it is with best human intentions. The way bodies move genuinely to beats, is after-all, gorgeous and affecting. Dance until you're sweating. And beads of perspiration remind you of life's best things. Down your back, like a book of blessings.

Go to the woods alone, and the trees and squirrels will watch for you. Go to an unfamiliar city, roam the streets, they are always statues to talk to, and benches made for sitting gives strangers a shared existence if only for a minute, and these moments can be so uplifting and the conversation you get in by sitting alone on benches, might of never happened had you not been there by yourself.

Society is afraid of alone though. Like lonely hearts are wasting away in basements. Like people must have problems if after awhile nobody is dating them.

But lonely is a freedom that breathes easy and weightless, and lonely is healing if you make it.

You can stand swathed by groups and mobs or hands with your partner, look both further and farther in the endless quest for company.

But no one is in your head. And by the time you translate your thoughts an essence of them maybe lost or perhaps it is just kept. Perhaps in the interest of loving oneself, perhaps all those ""sappy slogans"" from pre-school over to high school groaning, were tokens for holding the lonely at bay.

Cause if you're happy in your head, then solitude is blessed, and alone is okay.

It's okay if no one believes like you, all experience is unique, no one has the same synapses, can't think like you, for this be relived, keeps things interesting, life's magic things in reach, and it doesn't mean you aren't connected, and the community is not present, just take the perspective you get from being one person in one head and feel the effects of it.

Take silence and respect it.

If you have an art that needs a practice, stop neglecting it, if your family doesn't get you or a religious sect is not meant for you, don't obsess about it.

You could be in an instant surrounded if you need it.

If your heart is bleeding, make the best of it.

There is heat in freezing, be a testament.
