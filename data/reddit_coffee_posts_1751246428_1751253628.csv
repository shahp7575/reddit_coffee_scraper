Your help is greatly appreciated.,"I'll apologize ahead of time, there's a lengthy bit of fluff in this post, but feel free to skip straight to the question.

I turned 30 this month and I've been doing some reflecting on life in various ways thus far, one being my finances, it's effect on my overall wellbeing, and my mismanagement of this aspect of my life.

-Reflection-

I've work in some sort of management position since I was 17, starting off in the workforce at a restaurant as a manager making 60k-70k a year, depending on the bonus structures that year, with nearly no liabilities at the time. In this time period of my life I wasn't as concerned with my own finances however within my first year of management, at 18, I was able to funnel 1.5 million dollars to the bottom line of one restaurant.

Needless to say I became a very popular topic for the district managers and eventually made my way to the ear of corporate, with the CEO coming by on one occasion to bring his children to get a milkshake personally from the kid that's made him loads of money and worked hard doing so. Looking back it was like I was an animal at the zoo, wow look at the stripes on this donkey, but at the time I was honored to have the CEO come visit my location personally.

My growth slowed at the store, but continued to hold steady. Corporate had decided that I'd be best suited to be spread across the district to other stores in our state, however I didn't receive a promotion to District manager, I guess they feared I was too young, 20 at this point. Instead, I continued to run my store and I was pulled off of salary and given a percentage of bonuses from the stores that I helped develop, 5 stores total.

At this point, I had more money I knew what to do with, but for four years I worked 90+ hours every week consistently. I lived off modafinil, coffee and chasing numbers, but damn I was a rock star. Eventually with the death of someone I considered to be an important father figure in my life, he died at work with his family at home, and I cracked.

I turned in my notice and quit. I was at 24 making 6 figures, no friends, failing relationships, physically shrilved from barely eating, and mentally exhausted.

Living off my savings, I took a year off work. I got back into the gym, spent some time at several occasions at my now ex's family beach house and  spent that year in reflection. For me it was a pivitol moment of my life where I realized I personally lacked balance. I tend to go all in or not at all.

Now here I am at 30 working at a energy storage manufacturing company as a production supervisor making 75k. I've placed some barriers up for myself to not allow my over work tendencies to kick back into high gear. Now I'm tired of working for someone else all together, but it's just not financially viable for me to give up this security at this time.

I find myself once again with that insatiable hunger to drive up some number, but this time my bottom line. I'd like to separate my need to work, focus my energy on other life endeavors and accelerate this investment process as quickly as possible.


-----Question-----

I'll be taking half of my income 50% (35k) each year to invest in high yeild dividends stocks and drip until I reach a livable income. 

With income as the primary focus, I'm looking at some high yeild monthly and weekly dividends to compound on as quickly as possible without having to manage as frequently.

I'm aware there's high risk involved, but I don't plan on cashing out anything other than the dividends once they reach say 40-50k.

Are there any suggestions on making this work effectively? 

Any ways of speeding this up demonstratably?

Has anyone ever gotten burned attempting this?

You guys help would be greatly appreciated.

They drive back and forth with the high beams lights on in my face wherever I‚Äôm parked, stall across the street, drive up slowly at the corner or alley and pull up to the side in view of my peripheral vision making U turns in an aggressive way, others walk by cross the street mocking and laughing loud enough for me to hear engaging in conversation about a certain topic that only I‚Äôm familiar with followed by indirect comments or stand at close proximity to where I am while others use the surrounding coffee shops and clothing stores to stare from inside.

Ok, so after a big breakup I moved into a new neighbourhood, and started seeing this very attractive guy around at my local coffee shop. We both appeared to enjoy hanging out there and doing work. I thought I caught him looking at me a few times... maybe. One day, he was sitting next to me and he was working on his resume and I saw his name on his laptop. I went home and like any girl would do, looked him up online. I found his Linkedin profile where he uploads videos of educational podcasts he hosts and I LOVED his personality and the way he interacts with his guests, he seemed so nice and super intelligent! He's totally my type. 

My crush developed, and I resolved to speak to him next time I saw him, but a month passed before I saw him again, and when I did, I chickened out and we just made more eye contact. Now, another month has passed and I haven't seen him around at all. I'm trying to use Hinge to go on new dates, but none of these guys really interest me because I still have a big fat crush on AWOL coffee shop guy who I may never even see again. I did not think it would be appropriate to message him on Linkedin + expose that I creeped him. 

Please, people of reddit, slap some sense into me, I am becoming obsessed with a mystery man and spending way too much time at coffee shops hoping he'll turn up. Thank you. ",1,1751253310.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

5 or 6 years ago, I matched with a girl in Bumble. We chatted, flirted, we had so many similar interests and I really thought she was cute. A bit femme, geeky and cute (my type). Sadly hindi consistent yung chats namin, sometimes I get busy in college (i was doing my thesis at that time) and she disappears and wont chat for days, until nawala yung momentum sa chat, to the point na nag mutual ghosting kami. 

We never really got to see each other on a date. 

A few years later, after having my worst breakup with another girl, I vowed to myself that I will NEVER date again. I told myself Im just gonna get so successful with my career out of spite and aggressively focused on improving my lifestyle. Dating was really out of the picture and I became so pessimistic with love that I genuinely believed I will end up being alone. 

Until I received a message in twt, from the SAME girl from Bumble who I ghosted (mutually ghosted??) saying in the lines of ‚Äúhey, I know it‚Äôs been years but are you still up for a date?‚Äù 

I blinked. Blinked twice. I was just eating leftover food in my apartment. I remembered her, remembered how we ghosted each other (I cringed so hard and I hoped she didnt resent me for it!). I think at that moment, I figured I think I healed enough. Wasnt expecting anything I was just, okay lets finally meet this girl.

And so we finally met. She was waiting for me to clock out from my work in the nearby coffee shop. Saw her reading a Jane Austen book in one of the outdoor chairs outside the cafe. she looked way different now, masc-presenting, had a cute tattoo, nose piercing, and what the hell really really CUTE.

We shook hands (laughed at it bc do people normally shake hands on their first date??), had ramen together, laughed a lot, roamed around the park afterwards, she explained why it didn‚Äôt work before, because she was still dealing with personal problems, also came from a very toxic relationship and needed more time to heal. I was also not ready for a relationship bc of my research. We both thought it‚Äôs irrelevant now. 

We ended our first date exchanging socials, had another date again a few days later, had our first kiss, our first overnight, we met each other‚Äôs fams, her sisters are amazing, she loves my mom.

The rest was confetti.

It‚Äôs been years now since we reconnected and she has been amazing since. We both came from very toxic relationships, so we both appreciated the fact that things are easy and light now. Every day she restored my optimism in everything. Little by little. Until it somehow feels like my walls are finally breaking. Disagreements didn‚Äôt feel like a war between the two of us, it‚Äôs just a problem we need to solve together. We respect each other. We support each other. 

So to those who are still looking for their happy ending, DON‚ÄôT LOSE HOPE. I was not expecting myself to be in a really healthy relationship (like is this real, pls pinch me). If you are in an unhealthy relationship, dont settle bc she is NOT the one. If you came from a breakup, heal in your own time. When you are ready, put yourself out there! Try to finally strike up a conversation with that cute girl, maybe give her number. Hell, you can even slide into the DMs of an old flame lol. 

Put trust in the universe that everything will fall into place, in the right time. It really is full of surprises.

Thank you so much for reading this long post and Happy Pride to all! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà‚ù§Ô∏è

I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶æPublic reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, ‚ÄúI would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!‚Äù

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It‚Äôs simply unbelievable!‚Äù

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶æPublic reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, ‚ÄúI would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!‚Äù

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It‚Äôs simply unbelievable!‚Äù

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

Yes, I used AI to make it (I know, Im lazy). The things in the boxes just stand for random thoughts, sensations, or ideas/worries/beliefs that can pop up during the session. Don‚Äôt take what‚Äôs written in the boxes too seriously if it sounds silly - it‚Äôs just a metaphor for any thought or idea that may arise at any point during the session. 

When you meditate using this technique, there are two main things to keep in mind:

1. Watch your mind - just be in it. Don‚Äôt try to focus on anything specific like your breath or a mantra; just let yourself be and relax. 

2. When thoughts appear, don‚Äôt identify with them. See them as external objects or passing phenomena.

The idea is to create a bit of distance between you and your thoughts - so you can just watch them come and go without getting pulled in. **Keep your mental activity and your consciousness separate.**

Has anyone else ever felt that weird mix of excitement and, well, a little emptiness right after retiring? Like one minute you‚Äôre dreaming about lazy mornings and finally binge-watching that series everyone‚Äôs been raving about, and the next, you find yourself staring at the wall wondering what to do with all this *freedom*? üôà 

That feeling has a name: the Retirement Blues. It‚Äôs more common than you'd think. We‚Äôve spent decades gearing up for this phase, only to find ourselves feeling a tad lost when it finally arrives. But guess what? You can beat those blues without heading to the pharmacy. üôå

Here are some of my favorite, and let‚Äôs be real, totally doable *strategies* to keep that joy alive in your golden years:

1. **Get Moving**: Have you ever noticed how a good walk or some light stretching can change your mood? Movement releases those happy hormones. Plus, nothing beats the post-workout glow! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2. **Stay Social**: Call up that friend you haven‚Äôt seen since forever (you know, the one who always tells the best dad jokes). Or join a local club‚Äîbe it book reading, knitting, or even pickleball! Social connections are crucial for our mental health. üòÑ

3. **Start a Passion Project**: Have something you‚Äôve always wanted to try, like painting or gardening? Now‚Äôs your time to shine! üé®üå± Channel that creative energy into something that excites you and watch those blues fade away.

4. **Practice Gratitude**: It sounds clich√©, but a little thanks can go a long way. Try jotting down three things you‚Äôre grateful for each day. It‚Äôll shift your focus to the positive and remind you that, hey, life is pretty darn good! 

5. **Explore Mindfulness**: Whether it‚Äôs yoga, meditation, or simply sipping your morning coffee while watching the world go by‚Äîbeing present can help alleviate feelings of longing or restlessness. Plus, it‚Äôs an excuse to slow down and catch your breath! ‚òïÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

6. **Volunteer**: Giving back not only helps others but can also work wonders for your mental state! Find a cause that resonates with you and dive in. The connection you build with others is priceless. ‚ù§Ô∏è

And remember, we believe in meaningful results. Sometimes it's about finding what lights us up and being proactive in pursuing it.

That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at today! It's time to let it out and clear some space. Think of this as our very own mental garage sale‚Äîno item too random, no thought too silly to share.  

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking:

- **What‚Äôs the one thing that keeps popping up in your mind like an unwanted pop-up ad?** Seriously, something that feels like it‚Äôs weighing your brain down. 
- **Is it that project at work that you just can‚Äôt seem to get motivated for?** You know, the one that makes you question your life choices at 3 AM? 
- **Or perhaps it‚Äôs a personal goal that feels so far away it might as well be on Mars?** üöÄ Honestly, why does that fitness change feel like mountain climbing on some days?  
- **Or maybe it‚Äôs just annoying everyday stuff?** Like how do I remind myself to drink more water when coffee looks so much more enticing?

Let‚Äôs be real for a second. **We all have days when we struggle.** And it's okay to not have it all figured out. Sometimes you just need to vent. It‚Äôs not about solving everything in one go. It‚Äôs about acknowledging what‚Äôs there, and that alone can be a relief. 

As we dive into this Brain Dump Bonanza, I‚Äôll start with my own cluttered thought. Right now, I'm overwhelmed by the feeling that I should be more organized. Like, my work emails could really use a Marie Kondo-level transformation. But every time I dive in, I get distracted by (admit it, you‚Äôve been there!) a meme or a coffee break that *just* felt necessary!

So, what‚Äôs in your clutter?  

- **Let‚Äôs slay that mental dragon together! üöÄ** Share your thoughts, rants, or even those odd little worries that sneak up on you. This is a safe space; we‚Äôre all on the same team here.
- **And hey, if something resonates with you, why not hit that ‚Äòupvote‚Äô button?** Let‚Äôs build a wall of support as we uncover our thoughts together.

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

# Chapter Two

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù

She‚Äôd met Jessica once. It hadn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience.

Roman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but his voice softened. ‚ÄúNot all men cheat, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-why‚Äôd she leave you then?‚Äù Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,‚Äù Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. ‚ÄúNot all of them have to do with cheating on the man‚Äôs part.‚Äù

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. ‚ÄúShe cheated on you?‚Äù she whispered, as if it were some great secret. ‚ÄúWas she an idiot?‚Äù

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she‚Äôd ever been interested before. She‚Äôd always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. ‚ÄúI worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.‚Äù

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. ‚ÄúThass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.‚Äù She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. ‚ÄúShould get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‚Äòem...‚Äù

Roman studied her with an amused expression. ‚ÄúYou know, this is the most I‚Äôve ever seen you relax around me.‚Äù

Blair lifted a hand lazily. ‚ÄúThass ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre... you‚Äôre normally soooo difficult to deal wit‚Äô‚Äù she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for that.‚Äù His lips twitched. ‚ÄúI expect the best. That‚Äôs why this company is where it is today.‚Äù

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. ‚ÄúSuppose so...‚Äù Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened, Blair?‚Äù

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. ‚ÄúI was an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because you trusted the wrong person?‚Äù

Blair let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúDan an‚Äô I grew up together, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th‚Äô city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston‚Äôs, and I was happy ‚Äòbout it. Now I wish he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

‚ÄúSo, the wedding‚Äôs off?‚Äù Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. ‚ÄúYep. We didn‚Äôt even have a date set.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was holding it up?‚Äù

She blinked at him. Why was he askin‚Äô so many questions? Why was he bein‚Äô so... nice? ‚ÄúMe. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly. ‚ÄúWhy? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?‚Äù

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. ‚ÄúIf what I saw t‚Äôday was anythin‚Äô to go by...‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she‚Äôd always known somethin‚Äô was off. There was no passion. No fire. She‚Äôd loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn‚Äôt even sad. Just... angry.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair‚Äôs face scrunched up as she remembered. ‚ÄúSaw him,‚Äù she slurred. ‚ÄúH-havin‚Äô sex with... ugh.‚Äù She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn‚Äôt quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn‚Äôt know why she did it. Maybe ‚Äòcause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn‚Äôt move. But then‚Ä¶ Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. ‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he murmured, voice rough. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt-‚Äú

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted‚Ä¶ to feel.

According to the US State Department security service, **""neighborhoods to the east of the city center like Colonia Palmira and San Carlos, as well as the area around the Multiplaza Mall / Boulevard de Juan Pablo II offer lower risk areas for international visitors, but even these areas are known to see muggings. Villa Nueva, El Rincon, Kennedy, and Comayag√ºela represent some of the higher crime neighborhoods in the city.""**

And according to Insight Crime, **""Due to its geographic location, Honduras¬† is one of the most important drug trafficking transshipment points¬† between South America and Mexico. With every branch of government and its armed forces plagued by corruption, the Central American nation has long played a vital role as a¬† transit point in which criminal groups enjoy official protection.**

**Over the last two decades, political protection has allowed traditional drug trafficking groups to flourish. Testimony provided by drug traffickers and Honduran politicians on trial in the United States has revealed deep-seated connections between organized crime and major political parties.**¬†

**Control of illegal activities in Honduras lies in the hands of local criminal groups connected to the country‚Äôs political and economic elite. The judicial system suffers from political manipulation and corruption, as well as a lack of transparency and capacity. Meanwhile, the Honduran police have proven to be one of the¬†most corrupt public institutions. The Army has also been accused of participating in criminal activities.**

**Most recently, the country‚Äôs crime groups have evolved and are now cultivating coca and processing their own cocaine after years of low-level experimentation, which has¬†permanently altered¬†the country‚Äôs drug trafficking infrastructure.""**

I also known that theres no middle class in Honduras, theres only the rich and EXTREMELY poor. The economy is mainly agricultural, accounting for like 14% of the GDP, but I don't know if that means the most common job is a farmer or if thats just the industry that contributes most to the economy. I know that the biggest export of Honduras is coffee, its biggest import is minerals and stuff, which it is rich in, I know that most people think the police are corrupt, I know that taxis are controlled by gangs in some parts of the country, especially in urban areas.  
  
I'd say I know the characteristics, structure, and dynamics of MS-13 and Barrio 18 inside and out, I know that they're extremely violent enemies to each other despite being nearly indistinguishable, but what I don't know is what methods they use to attack each other. Do they use certain weapons, like 9mm pistols are ak-style machine guns? I know that they're notorious for the use of machetes, at least historically, but do they still use that in confrontations with each other? How do they communicate with each other, telegram or discord or what? Where do they live? In California they live in abandoned buildings called ""destroyers"", is it the same in honduras? I know that a lot of them have normal jobs as well. 

And Yulan, the short guy with a 5 million dollar bounty who leads all of MS-13 in Honduras, whats the structure below him look like? Who are his seconds-in-commands, and who are the leaders below them? And what does their Barrio 18 counterpart command-and-control structures look like? 

Is there any video footage or recordings of honduras? I mean like, stuff from people who've recorded incidents on their phones either out in the open or discreetly, along with security camera footage, car footage, etc.?

Does law enforcement in Honduras use bodycams? 

Is there any organized or individual resistance to MS-13 or Barrio 18 in Honduras, similar to Mexico with the cartels or ISIS and Assad in Syria? And is there any media or reports of that type of stuff? ",1,1751251346.0,Honduras,0,1.0,False

Feb-Oct 2019: talking stage. Met twice. Ghosted me on the 3rd scheduled date.

5 years after...
March 2024: nagparamdam si kyah! Kasi nakabili sila ng mom nya ng property 5 mins away from my hometown! 

March 2024 - Aug 2024: talking stage ulit. Met 5x wholesome dates, kwento kwento lang and coffee to talk about life.

Sept 2024: ghosted agen

Dec 2024: nabuhay si kyah. Na-depress daw siya hence the social media detox. 

Nag-uusap kami til now.

But along the way during our joke time moments, nakwento niya about his *totga* na nameet niya rin through common friends back in 2019 who ghosted him after their 1 year talking stage. That nong August 2024 nagchat daw ulit si totga sa kanya but ghosted him again after sometime. And admittedly he felt happy daw ulit during their rekindled communication tho short-lived.

Reflection: i was madly in love with him last year na nag-uusap kami

Only to find out na may iba palang nagpapatibok ng puso niya at sabay niya pala kaming kausap noong August 2024 :((

I am super lean, I am just really muscular. I climb up to v9 and do yoga so I just have a body that reflects that. Every time I wear a sleeveless shirt at the gym (or in the world at all) people stare at me. And no that's not in my head, they STARE at me. Sometimes strangers make comments about how ""jacked"" I am, sometimes women compliment me and ask what I do (literally nothing except climb hard boulders), sometimes people even touch my arms without asking, the other day at the coffee shop at 7am the barista gawked at my arms and was like ""oh my god your ARMS"" and it made me want to fucking throw coffee in her face. Because most of the time I just want to live and not be gawked at like some weird side show? I know it's ""a compliment"" but I'm existing outside the boundaries of what you are supposed to look like as a woman

I am 5'3 and as of today 113.2 pounds. I have like very low body fat so it's mostly muscle like you can see the veins in my biceps not just my forearms. I never wanted my body to look like this, I certainly never TRIED to make it look like this, I just climb hard boulders. OH people have also made jokes about how I take steroids or something too. It honestly makes me feel so bad about myself lol

It makes me think this is partly why I'm perpetually single too, because I'm too masculine, like I'm stronger than most of the men at the climbing gym. I'm not like power lifter body, just my back and arms are very ""cut"" I guess.

idk I'm sick of people telling me I'm ""jacked"" it makes me want to stop doing sports and starve myself into being a waif again. I feel like the trope that men don't like women who are strong is kind of true.

1lnwi0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1lnwi0q/a_memory_of_a_photo_from_months_ago_makes_me/,A memory of a photo from months ago makes me sourly remember you,"I was tired when we met. I was desperate for rest after bouts of depression and anxiety. It had been a long-ass battle I had to silently fight. I was in the middle of submissions, revisions, advanced readings for a postgrad while finishing my current postgrad. My ambitious and spirited self was right at the edge of exhaustion

Generally, I was tired. And I met you

You came in with this energy, enthusiasm with this vigor and sweetness. You were intense. Honestly, from the very beginning, you scared me. And I should have blocked you

But then the game started

I thought it was harmless. I was tired. And over a cup of coffee, after deciding to pursue another degree, a friend told me, ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs no harm done.‚Äù That made sense. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be serious because, heck, I didn‚Äôt even want serious

It became playful. You said so many words

And I someone whose mind was already dulled by skepticism toward men found it ironic. I saw it. I even found it funny, how after just a few days, you had the audacity to talk about a ‚Äúsense of peace.‚Äù How you invoked deep words, tried to make sense of your breakup by comparing it to what you claimed to feel about me

And still, I entertained it. Because I was tired. Because I needed a break from all the seriousness and defensiveness

I liked the attention. I liked the game. It made me feel alive. And for some sick reason, I missed that feeling. I had grown boring after years of forgetting how to feel and focusing only on becoming independent

It was fun. And no I never entered it with grand illusions. I knew what I was getting into

But then you had the audacity to make a grand gesture. To make me question my own beliefs.
To persuade me to open the cracks and let you in

Only to show me, the very next day, that people like you who claim authenticity and honesty are sometimes the most fake of all

What did you say again? ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù?

Sorry for what, exactly? I wanted to laugh. You sounded ridiculous

I asked myself, why did I let you in? Why did I let you get close?

Maybe it‚Äôs because I was vulnerable and tired. Maybe I liked the attention. Maybe I craved intimacy. That easy kind of love that claims to be real. Maybe I wanted it to be easy and you made it seem that way

But I rest in this truth: I entered that game willingly. Before you could make me more foolish, I saw you. And I paid you back

## Key Features Analysis

The durability, appearance, and overall quality of a round marble table top depend heavily on its key features. Understanding these features will enable you to make a more informed purchase, ensuring you select a table top that meets your specific needs and preferences.

**Marble Type:** The type of marble used substantially impacts the table top's appearance and durability. Carrara marble, known for its subtle gray veining on a white background, is a popular choice for its classic elegance. Calacatta marble, with its bolder and more dramatic gold or grey veining, offers a more luxurious and distinct look. Other varieties like Nero Marquina (black marble with white veining) and Emperador (brown marble with white and gold veining) provide different aesthetic options.the density and porosity of different marble types also vary, affecting their resistance to stains and scratches.

Choosing the right marble type is crucial for both aesthetics and functionality. A marble with a lower porosity will be more resistant to stains, making it ideal for high-traffic areas or dining tables where spills are likely to occur. The appearance you choose defines the character of the table top and ideally, the room it occupies.

**edge Profile:** The edge profile refers to the shape and finish of the table top's edge. Common options include bullnose (rounded edge), beveled (angled edge), ogee (an S-shaped curve), and straight edge (a clean, modern look). The edge profile not only contributes to the overall aesthetic but also affects the table top's safety and comfort. A rounded edge is typically safer,while a beveled or ogee edge can add a touch of elegance and sophistication.

The choice of edge profile should be based on both aesthetic preference and practicality. A rounded edge is often preferred for households with children, as it reduces the risk of injury. A straight edge offers a contemporary look and is easy to clean.Before committing to a style it is important to consider how the edge profile affects the surrounding decor.

**Thickness:** The thickness of the marble table top directly impacts its strength and stability. A thicker table top, typically 1.25 inches or more,provides greater resistance to cracking and warping. Thinner table tops, while lighter and potentially more affordable, may be more susceptible to damage, especially with heavy use.

A suitable thickness will improve overall experience and durability for the table top. For larger table sizes, a thicker marble slab is recommended to prevent sagging and ensure structural integrity. The table's base should be chosen to correctly support the dimensions of the table to further ensure stability.

**Surface Finish:** The surface finish of the marble table top influences its appearance and tactile qualities. Polished finishes offer a high-gloss shine that enhances the marble's veining and creates a luxurious feel. Honed finishes, conversely, provide a matte look with a smooth, velvety texture. Leathered finishes offer a textured surface that adds dimension and depth.

The finish of a table-top must balance look and feel with ease of care. Polished finishes may be more prone to scratches, while honed finishes are generally more resistant to everyday wear and tear. Ultimately, the choice of surface finish depends on the desired aesthetic effect and the level of maintenance you're willing to undertake.

Key features of round marble table tops include:

*   Variety of marble types (Carrara, Calacatta, nero Marquina, etc.)
*   Choice of edge profiles (bullnose, beveled, ogee, straight)
*   Range of thicknesses for enhanced durability
*   Selection of surface finishes (polished, honed, leathered)

The staff are certainly friendly and helpful. The lobby and room were very clean with nice decor. There is also valet parking which is convenient in NYC. While the elevators are slow, there are 26 floors. On the other hand, why are there only two elevators for those 26 floors? We stayed in a City Lights suite: The sitting area of our room was spacious; spacious, that is, as long as the sofa isn‚Äôt opened into a bed. It had a desk, a credenza, a chair for the desk and a chair for sitting. There are two square ottomans which I am not sure what their purpose is because they don‚Äôt seem to go with the room and take up space. The kitchen area had a refrigerator and a dishwasher, a microwave and plates, bowls and coffee cups. The drawers, however, have scuff marks on one side, possibly from the dishwasher door? Where are people going to use those plates and bowls since there is no coffee table and the credenza is awkward to eat on? The bedroom had a large king size bed which I found to be too big for the room. There is room for only one person to pass by the foot of the bed and not much room at that. The one big problem I found with the bedroom is that there was no way to cool it down. I set the thermostat for 61, but it showed the room temperature initially at 72 and then it went up to 74. Maintenance has got to look into this. Another issue I had with the bedroom is that there is no door. This could account for the fact that the room never got cool. There was a chifforobe in the bedroom but no other closet space. Meaning luggage has to be kept in a corner of the hotel room. There was a large mirror in the hallway, opposite the bedroom. Looks nice but on closer inspection, there are missing tiles in the frame around it. The bathroom was the high point of the room with lots of light. A fantastic rain shower with a glass door that swings open rather than slides. I just wish the shower head had more settings on it. The large mirror had a television built into it which I found very cool. All in all, a nice hotel but it is certainly not up to the level of the Pierre or the Fairmont Copley in Boston.

Movies are another love of mine, especially dramas, rom-coms, musicals, and some thrillers and comedies. The last film I caught in theaters was ""Materialists."" I enjoyed it, although it wasn't as romantic as I expected‚Äîso I might see it again with a fresh perspective.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances‚Äîit‚Äôs always a magical experience.

It was awful: I felt like I was going to pass out, not go to sleep. Then R, my angry alter, came out and I was badly dissociated. I was so terrified I got up and drank cup after cup of coffee. I didn't sleep at all.

But now, I have no choice. I'm drinking coffee and smoking, using one cigarette to light another, for the nicotine stimulant. My wife hates it, and I know she's going to find out. But I am beyond caring: any port in a storm.

At least I feel that, when I do go to bed, I have some control. The absolute worst is when I'm so tired that all I can do is lay there and feel my thoughts leave me. It is the most terrifying thing in the entire world, worse than PTSD, worse than switching; worse than anything.

Gods, I hate this fucking illness.

But at least I feel more awake. I'm going to have one more cup of coffee and another cigarette and then give it a try. If it still goes bad, I don't know what I'll do. I can take another Adderal, but that just means I'll have to pay the piper later.

In order to wed his first love, my fianc√©, Wesley Houcci, publicly exposed my father's identity as an undercover agent. That resulted in my father being strung up and tortured for one entire day and night.

In the end, my father's legs were chopped off, his eyes were gouged out, and he was thrown into a metal cage and burned alive.

Just as I, Amara Slatero, was consumed with thoughts of revenge against Wesley, my childhood friend, now the Don of Scricia, rushed back from abroad with an army of men.

Bruno Zedano mobilized his entire family's power and influence to hire the best legal team for my father and promised to clear his name. I believed him.

After the funeral, I broke off my previous engagement to Wesley and married Bruno, the man who had allowed me to lean on him during my darkest hour.

Five years later, while standing outside a private room, I accidentally overheard a conversation between Wesley and Bruno, who were inside.

""Every time Amara sees me, she looks like she wants to do nothing else but tear me to shreds. But if the dumb woman ever finds out that the person who sold out her father is actually her husband who holds her in his arms every night, do you think she'll lose her mind?""

My hand, which was just about to push the door open, froze in mid-air.

Wesley's mocking voice continued, ""You're truly ruthless, Bruno! Amara saw you as an older brother when she was a kid, and now that she's older, she climbs into bed with you naked. Never in her wildest dreams would she imagine that the person who actually uncovered her father's true identity was you!""

I stood frozen by the doorway as Wesley's voice echoed, thick with meaning.

""Look at how that idiot, Amara, massages your shoulders and feet every day, acting like she wants nothing more than to dig her heart out and offer it to you. If she ever finds out that you were the one who tipped off the boss about her dad being a mole, don't you think she'll skin you alive?""

""Shut up,"" Bruno warned coldly.

""Ha! Who knew there'd come a day when you‚Äîthe Don of Scricia‚Äîwould pretend to be a saint? Mr. Slatero was always so nice to you when you were a kid, and yet, you sent him straight to his death just because you wanted to please Lilah.""

Bruno slammed the liquor bottle down hard on the table as he snarled through gritted teeth, ""I'll never be able to repay what I owe Amara and Mr. Slatero. Everything I did back then was so that Lilah could be safe. If you dare touch a hair on her head, I'll make you wish you were dead.""

Wesley snorted. ""What a hopelessly devoted Don you are. At least you're sincere about Lilah. Too bad she wants nothing to do with a devil whose hands are as covered in blood as yours. You'd be better off staying with Amara. She thinks you're her redemption, but little does she know‚Ä¶ you're her worst nightmare.""

The sound of shattering glass rang out loudly. I fought to stop my trembling and quickly headed toward the rooftop bar.

I downed a shot of strong liquor in one gulp. I usually never drank, so the burn left me coughing so badly that tears were streaming down my face. The conversation I had just overheard kept echoing inside my mind.

As it turned out, it hadn't been Wesley who had betrayed my father all those years ago, but Bruno‚Äîthe man who had supposedly come back to seek justice on my father's behalf.

That corpse, mutilated beyond recognition, had actually been Bruno's handiwork. No wonder the always-calm Bruno had looked so dazed when he stared at my father's charred remains in the funeral home. I had naively assumed that it was because of grief and anger.

Never had I imagined that the man who had been sleeping beside me for five years was the true executioner who had sent my father to his death. All the tenderness and affection he had woven for me all these years was nothing but his way of atoning for his sins.

How ridiculous.

Hatred bubbled in my chest.

Just as I reached for another glass, Bruno suddenly wrapped his arms around me from behind and drunkenly buried his face in the curve of my neck.

""Where'd you go, Amy? I missed you‚Ä¶ Let's go home, okay?""

These past years, every time he got drunk, he'd always hold me like this and tell me over and over again how much he loved me.

Chapter 2

Bruno's men always said that the well-respected Don of Scricia never told lies and that he truly loved me. But now, all of it only made me feel sick.

Expressionlessly, I helped him into the bulletproof car. Bruno laid his head down on my lap, and his furrowed brows finally relaxed, making him look like a harmless child.

""Lilah, why‚Ä¶ Why couldn't it be me‚Ä¶""

I was finally able to clearly hear the name he had murmured countless times in his sleep. Lilah Biatchi‚Äîthe woman who had caused me to lose everything‚Äîwas the woman he had hidden deep inside his heart.

As it turned out, Bruno had never forgotten her. He had even put on this show of being with me just for her. I had been too naive, underestimating how deep his obsession with Lilah was.

His satellite phone with a golden lion emblem slipped out from his custom-made suit pocket. As I leaned down to pick it up, an encrypted message popped up on the screen.

""Don Zedano, thank you for stepping in tonight and settling the feud with the three major families on my behalf. But I can't accept that underground territory of Scricia that you promised. It's just too much!""

Immediately after, Lilah updated her private social media account‚Äî""Only a true queen deserves to wear a crown.""

Accompanying the caption was a photo of a ruby-encrusted antique ring. Allegedly, the ring was an emblem representing the oldest underground family in Scricia, symbolizing ultimate underworld power.

I knew Lilah was showing it to me on purpose.

Earlier this week, during a fight between families, a bullet had torn through Bruno's chest and gravely injured him. Yet the moment he was barely able to stand on his own two feet, he flew abroad. I was both furious and worried sick, thinking he was risking his life for his family's honor.

But in reality, he had gone to attend a family's succession ceremony. Even while recovering from a gunshot wound, he still fought to have that ring that symbolized ultimate power and gifted it to his true love.

As if something had come over me, I entered his passcode. The moment the final digit was keyed in, the screen lit up. The passcode was Lilah's birthday.

Bruno had never let me touch his personal phone, saying that it was a rule of a Don.

After unlocking it, the first thing that caught my eye was a photo of Lilah smiling in a lavish gown. No wonder his gaze always softened unconsciously whenever he turned on his phone. Then, I opened some folders and found photo albums named after her.

""Lilah‚ÄìOpera House"".

""Lilah‚ÄìVineyard"".

""Lilah‚ÄìCoronation"".

There was a sea of photos there, all of which were of Lilah at the banquets of various major families. There wasn't one photo of me in those thousands of photos. Even he himself wasn't in them. Only Lilah could be found.

Just like how his heart had always‚Äîand would always‚Äîbelonged to her.

The car pulled into the castle. I stared in the direction of the empty basement, my whole body cold.

That room once held my father's badge and the evidence he had collected while he was undercover. It was proof that he had gone undercover for 20 years in order to infiltrate the underground families.

Every time I saw those items, I felt like my father was still out there, finishing the mission he never got to complete.

However, one morning, all that evidence that could've turned all the underground families on their heads suddenly disappeared. The police said that it had been anonymously destroyed. I was completely shattered, and Bruno held me for three sleepless days.

Now, I understood. It had been him. He had destroyed the last piece of my father that I had been holding on to with his own two hands.

Another encrypted message suddenly popped up.

""Don, the will has been finalized per your request. All the Scrician underground power under your name and the succession rights will be transferred to Ms. Biatchi. We're just awaiting your final confirmation and signature.""

Through my tear-filled eyes, I seemed to see the scene from so many years ago.

Bruno, formally dressed in mourning attire, had sworn to me at my father's funeral‚Äî""Amy, I swear on my honor as a Don that I'll give you a home. Everything I have will be yours.""

Chapter 3

I placed Bruno on the bed but didn't take off his shoes and socks like I usually would. Instead, I headed straight for the guest room.

Before closing my eyes, memories of how he had doted on me all these years flooded my mind.

‚Ä¶

The next morning, sunshine streamed through the glass and caressed my face. When I opened my eyes, I immediately met Bruno's focused gaze. He leaned down, planting a kiss on my forehead.

""Amy, were you upset last night? I'm sorry. I drank too much at the meeting of the families. I promise it won't happen again,"" he said, his voice as gentle as always.

I gave a soft hum in response, then slipped into the bathroom to wash off his scent. When I came down, an exquisite Aitarian-style breakfast was laid out on the dining table. I used to always be so moved by this. But now that I had seen his phone, I couldn't smile anymore.

Everything laid out on the table was Lilah's favorite.

The doorbell rang, and Lilah walked in, dressed in the latest couture dress. She sat down at the table with natural ease and smiled at me.

""Sorry to bother you, Amara. Don Zedano and I will be delivering a shipment this morning, so he asked me to come for breakfast.""

I stared at the access card in her hand‚Äîthe same highest-level access card that I had‚Äîand fell silent.

Bruno, sensing something was off, quickly leaned in to explain in a whisper, ""Lilah is our most trusted personnel. It's normal that she has access to the estate.""

The words had barely left his mouth when he leaped up nervously, snatching the mug of hot coffee from Lilah's hand. ""You have low blood pressure. You shouldn't be drinking espresso. You still don't take good care of yourself even after all these years.""

Lilah chuckled softly. ""That's true. It's a good thing you've always remembered.""

As they stared into each other's eyes, something seemed to shift in the air around us. I got up to leave, but Lilah called out to me.

""Amara, the body restoration today needs professional documentation. Can you come take the photos? I don't trust the new forensic examiner.""

I hadn't touched a camera again‚Äînot after my father's brutal death.

Just looking through the viewfinder would remind me of how he had taught me to take photos for evidence, of how defiant he must've felt while being tortured. And thus, I couldn't bring myself to press the shutter anymore.

Bruno was well aware of this. He had locked away all my photography gear, saying that I could always pick it up again when I was ready. But now, he was shoving me into the back seat of the bulletproof car without letting me say a word.

""Amy, you know Lilah gets car sick easily, so I'm afraid you'll have to sit in the back.""

Yet he had somehow forgotten that after going on the run so many times, I had developed vertigo worse than Lilah's.

The car ride the whole way there was so bumpy that I became nauseated.

When we arrived at the morgue, Bruno carefully checked Lilah's protective gear and personally escorted her into the restoration area. Meanwhile, I leaned against the car, gasping for breath while trying to ease my nausea.

""Amy, the restoration is about to start. Don't be stubborn. This documentation is critical for Lilah and her family,"" Bruno said as he dragged me inside.

I lost my balance, nearly dropping the equipment. This was the first time in five years that I was holding a camera again. Fear surged through me, and my fingers trembled uncontrollably. I forced myself to stay calm as I continued taking photos of the restoration process.

During a midway check, only Lilah and I were left. She looked at my photos with disdain, a cold smile curling at her lips.

""Amara Slatero, you're as useless as your father. Who gave him the nerve to infiltrate the mafia when he couldn't even keep his identity as an undercover agent a secret? And you're nothing but a rat. You don't deserve to be with the Don of Scricia.""

I clutched my camera so tightly that my knuckles turned white. I was fighting hard to suppress the rage that was about to explode. Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain across my cheek.

Lilah pulled her hand back, her eyes filled with contempt. ""How dare you take the title of the Don's wife? I never expected you to latch onto Bruno so quickly after getting dumped by Wesley.""

Chapter 4

""You're not worthy of him. Whether it's Wesley or Bruno, they'll forever belong to me! You'll never be worthy!"" Lilah hissed.

My face was still numb from the slap. But before I could react, Lilah suddenly grabbed my hand and, using me for momentum, flung herself to the floor. All curled up on the floor, she instantly appeared pitiful.

""Amara, it's not that I think your photos are bad‚Ä¶ I just wanted to ask if you could try a different angle. But‚Ä¶ it's okay‚Ä¶""

Bruno walked in right at that moment, and the kettle in his hand fell to the floor. He rushed over, pushed me aside, and quickly checked on Lilah.

""Bruno, I'm okay. Don't blame Amara. I was the one who lost my balance‚Ä¶""

""You're too kind-hearted, Lilah. You don't need to cover for her. I saw everything!"" Bruno carefully helped Lilah up, treating her as gently as if she were a wounded gazelle. He held her close as he fixed me with a cold, sharp gaze.

This was the first time in our five years of marriage that he had looked at me in such a way.

""Amara, apologize to Lilah! I've been too lenient with you all these years, and now, you're going so far as to harm your sister-in-arms! Do you know that an injury to her face could affect her missions?""

Bruno's rage-filled eyes bore into me, yet he somehow didn't see the handprint on my face.

I met his gaze calmly. ""Lilah is the one who should apologize. She insulted my father! Bruno, are you not going to explain the things you did to my father?""

A flash of panic crossed his eyes. ""That's so far in the past already. Why are you making a fuss about it now? I promised him I'd protect you, but that was on the condition that you wouldn't hurt Lilah.""

I snorted coldly, finally seeing his true colors. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit me, and I fell backward.

When I opened my eyes again, the sharp smell of disinfectant flooded my nose. A female doctor working for the family happened to be packing up her instruments.

""Congratulations, you're pregnant! You've always been healthy, but you'll need to take good care of yourself during this time, and make sure your emotions don't spike.""

My hand reflexively moved to my lower abdomen. For the past five years, I had always hoped for a child with Bruno. And yet, the baby just had to choose this time to arrive.

My private phone vibrated. It was a message from Bruno. ""The doctor said you just need to rest. Once you apologize to Lilah, I'll have someone pick you up and bring you back to the Scrician castle.""

I sneered as I turned off my phone.

""Ma'am, the Don has arranged an additional examination for you. Please follow me."" As I followed the doctor toward a side room, I sensed that something was off.

Lilah's voice suddenly rang out from behind me. ""I heard you're pregnant? Looks like I underestimated you. Do you know why you haven't gotten pregnant these past five years?""

I turned around, meeting her smug gaze.

""Because I told the Don that your child would jeopardize his whole operation in the mafia. The calcium supplements he gives you every day are actually contraceptives!""

Lilah studied my reaction carefully, waiting for me to break down. But I just responded calmly, ""Okay.""

As I turned around, preparing to leave, a powerful force suddenly hit me from behind. Losing my footing, I tumbled down the marble stairs. Pain flooded through my body, and I watched helplessly as blood seeped across the expensive carpet.

I lost our child.

The moment I left the operating room, I placed the divorce papers on the bedside table in the ward I had been placed in. I left the family's private hospital and headed straight for the airport.

Just before takeoff, a final text from Bruno came through. ""I didn't think you'd have the guts to cross Lilah. You don't have an ounce of class that befits the title of the Don's wife. Put away your pride and apologize immediately!""

I crushed the SIM card and threw it into the trash can at the airport.

Bruno, who was tasting wine with Lilah at the castle vineyard, suddenly heard his private phone ring.

""Don Zedano! Mrs. Zedano has gone missing! She left a‚Ä¶ document on the bedside table. You must take a look at it!""",1,1751250394.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

The greenhouse will accommodate plant life such as¬†banana trees, cocoa trees, coffee (robusta/arabica), lemon trees, orange trees, and other similar species, which means some could reach¬†7‚Äì9‚ÄØm in height, requiring deep soil beds and heavy loads on the structure.

I'm currently exploring how I can integrate this very heavy greenhouse into my design, but am struggling to find precedents and details I can refer to, especially ones that use low-carbon materials.

I'm hoping to get some guidance around material choices that meet low-carbon goals and can help the building feel welcoming, comfortable, and homely (a leading theme of my design) - I'm currently looking at either CLT (mainly for its low-carbon impact and its atmospheric aesthetics), reinforced concrete with GGBS/PFA cement or a steel frame (for it's strength and popularity in other similar projects, but undesirable due to its high embodied carbon content unless I was able to use recycled steel?)

I‚Äôve researched projects like Agrotopia and Lufa Farms greenhouse structures, as well as designs such as the Eden project, but it seems that they all have steel structures and I've found it very hard to source any structural details for them or any similar projects that use alternative materials. Mostly, I'm interested in finding an alternative low-carbon material choice that I can try to make work for my design, but I also want to discuss whether I could justify the use of a steel structure in a low-carbon design.

Any conceptual insights, precedents, or structural principles you‚Äôve seen in projects with heavy rooftop planting would be greatly appreciated! Also, looking for recommendations for any books on details, materials or structures that might help build my knowledge on this area.

You probably thought the same, didn‚Äôt you? I don‚Äôt blame you. You were always the loud one, the one everybody noticed. You never looked behind you when you walked alone. Never thought twice about locking your door.

You should start.

I saw you last Tuesday. You didn‚Äôt see me, of course. You were picking up coffee. Ordered the same thing you always do oat milk, cinnamon, half-sweet. You smiled at the barista, and then you checked your phone. You were reading her texts again. The ones she never answered.

I watched your face when you stared at the screen. You didn‚Äôt look sad. You looked‚Ä¶ relieved.

I knew right then. You didn‚Äôt just know what happened to her. You had something to do with it.

And when I followed you home that night, just to be sure, you made it too easy. One garage code your birthday. I didn‚Äôt go inside. Not yet. I just stood there, in the dark, and memorized the layout.

You have terrible curtains, by the way.

The thing is, I‚Äôm not some killer. I‚Äôm not unstable. I‚Äôm just someone who waited too long for the truth. And you, you were never going to give it to me.

So I‚Äôm going to take it.

I‚Äôve been closer than you think.
That noise you thought was your fridge last night?
That wasn‚Äôt your fridge.

That text you got from an unknown number at 3:02 a.m.? You didn‚Äôt open it. You should have.

That wasn‚Äôt spam.

You‚Äôve got about five minutes to read this before your power cuts out. Maybe less. And when it does if you‚Äôre smart you‚Äôll stay exactly where you are. Don‚Äôt move. Don‚Äôt talk. And whatever you do, don‚Äôt call anyone.

It‚Äôs too late for that.

You don‚Äôt remember what you did.
But I do.

I have issues with eating, a naturally weak immune system that I am treated for, drink a lot of caffeine and used to drink and smoke quite a bit. So I've always been a bit weaker than others but not to the point where it impacted me really. I noticed recently that I've been getting so much more tired. It's at the point where I can barely find the energy to go about daily activities, constantly feel weak and shaky or nauseous, sometimes even passing out. I used to barely sleep and now I'm sleeping practically all day, have to lie down halfway through even cleaning my room, can't go out for more than a couple of hours without completely crashing exhausted and sleeping for hours after. I feel like I shouldn't be this tired. 

I stopped smoking months ago and haven't drunk properly for months either, made sure at least for the past week that I'm eating at least two meals a day, go on a run three days a week and exercise every evening (js like stretches and crunches and stuff to strengthen my muscles). I take creatine to build muscle which my mum recommended bc I am quite skinny and I have started taking my iron supplements again. I still feel tired. My brain just is always telling me to lie down. I have an aunt who struggles w chronic fatigue and I really don't want to. It's summer and I want to be going out and doing things but I don't have the energy to even think. I've been resisting coffee bc I'm pretty sure it will make it worse and I have plans to go out every day next week to try like spend some time outside and less time in my room but idk what else I can do. 

It feels like every day I get tired earlier and earlier, feel more and more weak and dizzy. I nearly passed out at work yesterday and had to be cut early. Does anyone have any other advice apart from what I'm already trying to maybe help with this? I'm considering going back to the doctors abt my immune system bc it does feel like I'm always ill but I would rather try and work on my lifestyle first I just don't know how to get more energy.

I'm here looking for my person to spend forever with. I dream of being together, maybe with a few kids too. I dunno, the thought of coming home from work and cooking dinner together and watching something before bed just sounds perfect to me. If that's something you want as well, you should reach out :)

Additionally I'm kind of a clingy partner and love to chat often! Sweet good morning/night messages melt my heart, and sharing little things through your day will keep me forever.

Some random facts about me:

* I load almost everything I eat with black pepper
* I'll always make a funny face or at least smile when going through an EZ Pass toll booth
* Left handed and born two months premature (my literal due date was April 1st and I feel like that says a lot lol)
* üòÖ is my favorite emoji
* I can't really have caffeine anymore so I'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't have soda a lot - but birch beer is my WEAKNESS
* Apologies in advance, but I'm not much of a gamer, or into anime
* And I have to edge the microwave and stop it with a second to go

Please message me with your name, age and where-ish you are. Hopefully you have some time, because I'd love to connect.¬†**Also - this is a dating post, so please plan on sending a few photos of yourself in the first few messages.**

I know no one‚Äôs likely reading this right now, but that‚Äôs okay. Some things are written not to be seen immediately, but to be felt when they‚Äôre finally found. This is one of those.

I am someone who is a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference.

Maybe you can tell I'm a bit of hopeless romantic, but hope brings me here tonight.

I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions,

I'm the kind of person who believes in the magic of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence. 

My heart has always been empathetic to other and i believe in the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM or driving over with some choclates to make my person happy. 

I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. For me there is beauty in the mundane, i'm the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others. 

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm) 
* Build: Slim * Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check 
* Eyes: Brown 
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed 
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned 

**Interests:** 

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. 

I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care. 

To sum up some typical interests include:
Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc 

**What I Am Looking For:** 

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. 

I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together. 

Expectations: 

* Mutual respect and understanding 
* Openness and honesty in communication 
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth 
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together 

**The Quest for You:** What am I seeking? 

Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. 

I yearn for a love that‚Äôs both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one‚Äôs soul. 

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. 

Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:** 

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you ; not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn. 

Laconic messages with just ""hi"", ""what's up,"" and the likes will be most likely ignored. If I can beat my own laconism when introducing myself here, so can you.

I've had my copper ember mug 2 for like 3 days now. I got it ""Used like new"" on Amazon for a discount. I'm really liking it! I am very slow to drink my coffee, I like to sip it over time, and it is so nice that I can always have a hot cup while I'm working even hours after pouring it. This thing is so dope. I really like the copper color. If I compare it to an actual solid piece of copper (a little memento on my desk from a nearby copper mine), it's definitely darker. Still looks amazing though.

I hope mine keeps working! The only issue I've had is one time when I didn't realize that the mug was turned off, so when I poured my coffee it didn't keep it warm. Once I realized it, I turned it on and it warmed back up. I thought it was supposed to turn on when it detects hot liquid, but maybe I messed it up somehow.

Also I'm using the iOS app without any trouble. So I hope that keeps working too.

How is your mug working out? How long have you had it? I'm curious if this is a ""ticking time bomb"" or if it's just that the most negative experiences are the loudest ones.",1,1751249398.0,Ember,0,1.0,False

The ground floor will be a publicly accessible, homely and welcoming community space, whilst the majority of the¬†first/top floor will be a greenhouse¬†growing¬†tropical fruits, herbs, and vegetables that don‚Äôt typically grow in the UK. The greenhouse will accommodate plant life such as¬†banana trees, cocoa trees, coffee (robusta/arabica), lemon trees, orange trees, and other similar species, which means some could reach¬†7‚Äì9‚ÄØm in height, requiring deep soil beds and heavy loads on the structure.

I'm currently exploring how I can integrate this very heavy greenhouse into my design, but am struggling to find precedents and details I can refer to - especially ones that use low-carbon materials.

I'm hoping to get some guidance and to discuss concepts around:

* How heavy rooftop greenhouses with deep planters and trees have been structurally accommodated in other buildings
* Strategies for balancing openness (which certain rooms, such as a seminar room need) on the ground floor with load paths for heavy rooftop planting
* Guidance on how to size grids for support columns to ensure that they can support these heavy rooftop loads - does anybody know of any good books or sources I can use to work this out? Our university course barely touches on structural details, so I'm a little bit lost!
* Material choices that meet low-carbon goals and can help the building feel welcoming, comfortable, and homely (a leading theme of my design) - I'm currently looking at either CLT (mainly for its low-carbon impact and its atmospheric aesthetics), reinforced concrete with GGBS/PFA cement or a steel frame (for it's strength and popularity in other similar projects, but undesirable due to its high embodied carbon content unless I was able to use recycled steel?)
* Ideas on how I can figure out the weight of the plants, trees, water tanks etc., that will be inside the greenhouse and its plant room so that I can start some calculations.

I‚Äôve researched projects like Agrotopia and Lufa Farms greenhouse structures, as well as designs such as the Eden project, but it seems that they all have steel structures and I've found it very hard to source any structural details for them or any similar projects that use alternative materials. Mostly, I'm interested in finding an alternative low-carbon material choice that I can try to make work for my design, but I also want to discuss whether I could justify the use of a steel structure in a low-carbon design.

Any conceptual insights, precedents, or structural principles you‚Äôve seen in projects with heavy rooftop planting would be greatly appreciated! Also, looking for recommendations for any books on details, materials or structures that might help build my knowledge on this area.

We were close growing up, though our connection has been more on-and-off in recent years as we've gone our own ways. Last summer, the three of us planned a trip to visit one of the friends (Friend A) out West. The other friend (Friend B) and I both live in the East, about two hours apart.

Friend B had been going through a rough patch in her relationship and wasn‚Äôt sure if she could join the trip. Friend A and I really wanted her to come, so we booked everything in advance and left the door open. Last minute, Friend B said she wanted to come but couldn‚Äôt afford the $400CAD for the flight. I found it a little surprising because she's very high income although she had gotten laid off earlier in the year but received a hefty severance and also has other sources of income. Anyhow I offered to cover it, telling her she could pay me back whenever she was able. I really just wanted us all to be together and didn‚Äôt want money to be the reason she missed out.

But then she backed out last minute and didn‚Äôt go. She offered to pay me back, but I told her not to worry and just to pay me when she could since she had mentioned earlier that money was a little tight. Fast forward a year,  she never brought it up again, even though we saw each other a few times and reminisced about the trip. It started to feel awkward to me, especially since she never acknowledged that she still owed me.

Finally, after seeing her again recently, I texted her and asked, ‚ÄúHey, are you able to pay me back for the trip from last year?‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I was going to but forgot,‚Äù and immediately e-transferred the money. I don't believe she forgot because like I mentioned above, we discussed the trip several times over the year and she agreed she wished she had joined friend B and I. If I were in her place, one conversation on the topic alone would've reminded me I needed to pay back. I've felt resentful that she didn't all this while and I felt awkward asking for it back and I only did because she didn't herself. Part of me can't help but think she was hoping I'd never ask and forget about it.

Anyhow, since our text exchange, I haven‚Äôt heard from her, not that we talked regularly, but still I can‚Äôt help but wonder if she‚Äôs upset I asked for money she owed lol.

For context, I don‚Äôt nickel-and-dime friends, this friend and I often take turns covering food or coffee when we go out, and I would never ask to be paid back for small things. But $400 was a big amount for me, and it felt fair to ask.

her:When I went out there it was just mom and I think one other person out there he came out like 10 min later. I understand you don‚Äôt want to talk to or about him but you can‚Äôt get mad at me for talking to him I will do my best not to talk about him to you but I‚Äôm not going to actively avoid him. Idk how I‚Äôm supposed to navigate this whole situation cause you‚Äôre my sister and ofc I don‚Äôt want to seem like I don‚Äôt give a shit about what happened to you cause I do but like you said that is my dad and I can‚Äôt just ignore that yanno? And I know he did fuck shit he put his hands around the throat and choked me but he‚Äôs made so much progress in being a better person since the fire especially I‚Äôve talked to him about a lot of stuff that went down and I know nothing he says or does will ever change what happened but I think at some point you should talk to him about it all and I can be there if you want but he genuinely doesn‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt talk to him and ik you don‚Äôt give a fuck about his feelings and rightfully so but you know it‚Äôs VERY rare when dad shows actual emotions but everytime we talk about you not coming around there‚Äôs a lot there mainly confusion and sadness and I think y‚Äôall could figure out a way to make you comfortable being around like him agreeing to keep distance and stuff yanno? I‚Äôm not trying to talk you into doing anything you don‚Äôt want to do I just really miss our family and it breaks my heart constantly thinking about the fact we may never be the same again and I hate it so much and idk what to do

me:i miss how it used to be too and i hate that it will never be the same too i miss having my dad too but a dad would never put his on me the way he did. i would love to have a relationship with him some day but it‚Äôs not my job to tell a grown man that touching his 13 year old child‚Äôs vagina is wrong. he knows what he did and i know that cus right after he bought me everything i asked for just to keep me quiet. you said that we could figure out a way to be comfortable around him, and as of yet this is it. if everyone gets to ignore/not be around aunt lisa for simply being annoying then i will proceed ignoring him/his existence. i‚Äôm not mad about you hanging out with him it just hurt. i don‚Äôt want you to stop hanging out with him i never asked that

her:I haven‚Äôt read your last message yet but he is taking the  pontoon out me mom and (roommate) are swimming if you y‚Äôall wanna join

i went out and swam with her after that, but we never talked about it. For the rest of vacation, either. She also didn‚Äôt bring him up once after that unless there were other people around. It‚Äôs been 4 days now.

She‚Äôs had the time to make a Facebook post about having a long emotional conversation with her roommate about an album, though.

I think she really needs therapy?

TLDR: my older sister has BPD, and I don‚Äôt know how to go about this situation. She always downplays me and plays the victim. When I first told her what happened with our dad, she did that mumbling under her breath thing and ignored me. There was never a falter in her relationship with our father when I told her what happened to me (csa) in fact it‚Äôs strengthened since I‚Äôve started avoiding him. I‚Äôve been extremely low contact for the past year with him. She doesn‚Äôt take me seriously but I do want to have a relationship with her despite what she‚Äôs also done to me growing up (cocsa)

1lnvolm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1lnvolm/sd_is_stressed_and_does_not_have_time_for_me/,SD is stressed and does not have time for me,"For context:

Over a month ago, my SD and I had agreed on a PPM arrangement that was to be once a week meets. We have had 2 proper (inconsistent) meets since then, excluding the M&G, and we clicked very very well. We are both after a genuine connection and we spend hours just talking in the hotel. He opened up to me during the first meet and I genuinely enjoyed being around him. The PPM is average when compared to my area.

However, he is extreeemely time poor at the moment, to the point where he is at work from 8am to 11pm...sometimes till the early hours of the morning. He says he will be like this for the next couple months but will try to find time for me in-between. We text everyday because he wants to keep that connection going (he wanted a bf/gf type dynamic when we first discussed the type of arrangement). I'm the one keeping the conversation going, uplifting his spirits, sending pics, trying to take his mind off work. I like texting him everyday, that's not the issue. We aren't meeting once a week as agreed and I feel like I have gone weeks without much received on my end.

I'm genuinely concerned for him too. He barely eats or sleeps because of his commitment to work, and basically survives off coffee everyday. I've already voiced this to him. 

I'm wanting to know, from a SD's perspective, what I can do for him during this time. And to the SBs who have experienced similar, if there's any new perspective that might make this feel more mutually beneficial. I'm treading carefully because I know he's already super stressed and focused on work. I do enjoy this SR and I want to give it a proper chance to develop.

1lnvn60,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1lnvn60/i_fucked_around_and_found_out/,I fucked around and found out.,"Downloaded a dating app for my friend's entertainment. It was in February. Wasn't looking for a serious relationship nor a fling, purely because i was also bored and my friend was sad and I wanted to give her some funny stories. I figured a valentine's date would be nice anyway. I had just gotten a new job that month also and was 2 weeks in. You appeared on my page and thought you were cute so I swiped right. I remember saying ""aww I hope we match"". We matched a few days later. I immediately messaged and you replied just as quick. You were fun to talk to and even wanted to meet, tho you said you couldn't take me on the 14th since you were going back to your country that day, but that was fine. We would meet the day before, then. You confirmed our date the night before we'd meet, just as i clocked in to my remote work. We set the date at 11am. What you actually didn't know is that I was already working nightshift that time, so after I clocked out at 6am, I lied down in bed for a while before I got ready. I put on makeup because I didn't have even a min of sleep. I was so sleep deprived that I wanted to just get it over with, and I was telling my friend that if you were boring, I was going to enjoy the food instead. Got to the cafe a min late and you were already there. I got drawn to you. The longer we hung out, the more I liked you. We said goodbye at 3:30 because you were meeting a friend. Inside the Grab, I called my friend all giggly--I was so kilig. Had to tell you that you were the best bumble date so far. You replied with the cutest reply. I was so kilig that day that I only got to sleep for 3 hours before my work started, and my head was pounding from all the coffee I had. You left me your number and I decided to text you to have a safe flight the next day with the intention of ending the dating app experience. After all, I only downloaded the app for 2 things only. I didn't expect you to reply to me and continue texting me. Soon enough, we started LDD- long distance dating. I knew I had to be careful. I didn't want to waste anyone's time if I wasn't serious, and at the same time, I didn't want anyone to waste my time. I knew damn well this thing wouldn't work out in the long run. But you were so cute. Truth be told, I didn't fall for you immediately. You continued flirting with me until... I did. We started ""joking"" around saying we should end our calls with ""love you"", until we actually meant the i love yous. I knew you meant it when you said those words to me. You weren't the type to throw around those words to just anybody else. You don't even say it back to your friends lol. You even showed me a journal(?) entry saying the loveliest things about me. 

Fast forward to June, we just stopped contacting each other that often. Maybe 1x or 2x a week only. You did tell me you started losing interest in me, and that honestly broke my heart. My first ever romantic heartbreak. Because I was out here still loving you. You said maybe it was bad timing and then the long distance too, which, I truly understood. Like I said, I knew this wouldn't work in the long run and yet I still went for it. I thought about it everyday, every night, and I knew in my heart this was just meant to happen at this time, and not for a long time. Now I'm playing all the sad songs I know. I started listening to more OPM too, because why are Filipinos so good at making sad ass songs. Yeah maybe we just know how to yearn. ""He's just some guy"", I keep telling myself everyday, and it works for like, 10 mins. The other day I got pissed at you and I thought it gave me another push to finally move on from you. Now I'm relapsing. When will this end? I'm so tired of checking your social media profiles hoping to see some updates from you. I used to get updates from you every fucking day. Now i couldn't call you that often anymore. We distanced ourselves from each other. It's just been a month, but how long am I gonna be like this? I got my Valentine's date and my summer romance but at what cost? Highkey i'm hoping you don't come back to the PH anymore. What's worse is that I kind of feel that you're already back here and you're just not telling me. What if I see you roaming around the area with another girl? What if I see you at a cafe or a speakeasy waiting for someone that's not me? You said you still wanted to spend some time with me when you're back here to see if it makes a difference in person.

***The Decanter of Endless Water.***

***Domains:*** *Water, States of Matter, Change, Process.*

***Sefirot:*** *Chalice of Pearline*

***Projected Appearance:***¬†

*She appears as three women conjoined as if partially overlapping, sharing a single presence that flows together with perfection.*¬†

*The central form is a woman of liquid water‚Äîher hair flowing like a spring, her skin shimmering with every ripple.*¬†

*To her right walks a woman of frost and crystal, her body formed from sculpted ice, movement slow and deliberate like memory preserved.*¬†

*To her left trails a mist-bodied twin, ever shifting and intangible, features fading in and out of visibility with the wind.*

***Personality:***¬†

*She is tranquil, boundless, and gently indifferent‚Äîcomforting as spring rain, merciless as the flood. She does not resist change; she is change, speaking in riddles and rhythms, always hinting at what must be surrendered to move forward.*¬†

*Emotionally distant yet strangely nurturing, she offers no permanence, no safety‚Äîonly the promise that the cycle will continue, the wheel will turn, and the dance will flow, effervescent, forevermore.*

Massive ice-crystal organs churn visibly within, suspended in slow revolutions like clockwork inside a liquid clocktower.*¬†¬†

*A cushion of thick vapor surrounds it, obscuring its full form‚Äîyet when struck by sunlight, rainbows arc across its silhouette, causing awe and terror alike. When it speaks, its voice changes ecosystems, erodes mountains or soothes hurricanes.*

***Projected Appearance:***

*The Armless God appears as a middle-aged man without arms, his body composed and dignified. He wears a haphazard fusion of priestly robes and faded war gear‚Äîan ash-gray cassock layered with ceremonial armor and empty sheathes.*

*His hair is tied in a loose man bun, and around his neck rests a steel halo etched with broken oaths and forgotten names. Calm and unassuming, his mere presence silences conflict and stirs a grief too ancient to name.*

***Personality:***

*Soft-spoken and unshakably still, the Armless God carries the heavy quiet of one who has seen every reason to act‚Äîand chosen not to. He carries neither mercy nor wrath, only the weight of peace's bloodstained past.*

*Once arrogant and hungry for power, he now embodies restraint as repentance, his wisdom forged in regret and sealed in silence.*¬†

***Compatible: Paragon, Twilight Giant, Death, Darkness***

***Mythical Creature:***

*This creature is a towering, headless, humanoid-bird draped in wings of broken and dulled swords, each feather a weapon once raised in violence and now stilled.*¬†

*Where its head should be, a floating steel halo spins silently, etched with forgotten causes and names of the fallen.*

***Quote:*** *‚ÄúOnce, he was hailed as a civilizations God King, crowned with ambition, his blade the harbinger of victory and death alike.*

*In a battle that shook his world, he slew a god‚Äîa bright flame that lit the war‚Äôs darkest nights. But his hunger did not abate, and he reached beyond, striking down the Great Old One who embodied peace itself.*

*In that final moment, standing alone amid the shattered ranks and the silent field, he found a crown he never sought pressed upon his brow‚Äînot as a conqueror, but as the new god of peace and regret. His arms were lost in the fight, severed by his own cruelty.*

*Now, the Armless God wanders the Field of Mourning, a lone sentinel whose scars speak louder than any war cry. He carries the weight of every life ended by his blade, his soul a pale memorial to restraint, repentance, and the cost of violence.‚Äù*

1lnvj4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1lnvj4d/trip_report_partial_w_trek_and_other_chile_places/,"Trip report: partial W trek and other Chile places, Dec 2024","Overdue post, but wanted to write this since this community helped a lot when researching.

**Background**

Never backpacked before, casual hiker meaning I usually hike on vacations and that's it. Casual runner, which helps w/ some cardio fitness.

Because of this did an unconventional path of the W trek and avoided needing to carry my pack w/ me the whole time. Skipped the part from Torres to Cuernos, so passing Lake Nordenskj√∂ld. Slept in the park though. Had my backpack (40L).

Didn't rent a car because I was nervous about the roads and getting a flat tire and not knowing how to change it.. In hindsight, doing the car would've given more flexibility.

Including times so people can see what's feasible..

**Partial W trek structure**

Base Torres (Central) --> Mirador Frances (did not go all the way to Britanico, but I think you have time too if you're a little faster than average, esp in the summer months!) (Paine Grande) --> Grey Glacier (Grey)

**Base Torres (Central)**

* Booked Bus Sur like everybody else. Bus station was chaos. I think you could def buy one of the other buses the day before or something. But I don't think they have online sites, so having the peace of mind is nice.
* Dropped off our pack at Central (it is just a white tent in the back. Don't even bother standing in line to check in because that was slow and took up time). Did the premium camping using their elevated tents - it's a bit away from the main refugio.
* Started the hike at 10am. Got to the top around 2p. This time included some waiting around / rest. Get back to camp at 7:30p.
* Brought backpacking food and used the hot water inside and ate inside in this 'lounge' area with a bunch of outlets. Best outlet system of the 3 refugios we stayed.
* You can book the meal there, but it says to do it before 3p. It looks like the a la carte stuff sold out (pizza, burgers etc) by the time we got there at 7:30p.

**Mirador Frances**

* Shuttle from welcome center to Laguna Amarga says it leaves at 8a. Really it was 8:15a...
* The shuttle tries to line up with the buses to go elsewhere, so wouldn‚Äôt worry on the schedule / time, but don‚Äôt miss the shuttle.
* 9a: Bus Sur bus from Laguna Amarga to Pudeto. Takes 30 minutes to get there, which is farther than I thought.
* Catamaran (ferry) doesn‚Äôt leave until 10:30. Cafe actually doesn‚Äôt have bad prices!! Sandwiches are \~$10 USD. There‚Äôs coffee too. They take credit card.
* 11a: arrive at Paine Grande. Luckily we‚Äôre the first ones at reception to drop off our bags. Bag drop is free for guests. Otherwise, 4.000 CLP! They didn‚Äôt ask if we were staying there, so be sure to mention it.
* Start hike to Mirador Frances (11:30a), Italiano w/ bathrooms (1:30p), reach  Mirador Frances  (2:45p, included some waiting time)
* Back to Paine Grande at 7:30p. Probably get lucky but end up getting 1 bunk bed, so essentially a private room and outlets too! Was expecting to share a room w/ other people. There were still people who were finishing their hike way later maybe closer to 9?... sunset is not until after 10 or something??
* Community room for people to hang up their towels, clothes, socks to dry. Hot water easy to access for backpacking food.
* Going up to Britanico probably would mean getting back after 9p.

**Grey Glacier and Bigfoot Glacier Hike**

* Leave Paine Grande (8a). This is the only part of the hike where I carried the big pack with me!! I did not pack it well I don't think. Windiest day
* 12:15p: get to Refugio Grey. Check is is not until after 1? This time the refugio is shared w/ 2 other people.
* Mirador is 15 minutes away.
* Bigfoot glacier hike at 2:30p ($200 USD). Booked online in advance. There was 1 other couple at this time. I read that someone just bought theirs the day before for a much cheaper rate...
* don‚Äôt think we get started on the actual glacier hike until 3:30p??
* 7p: get back to the boat and head back to Bigfoot. So it‚Äôs a little over 3 hours of walking??
* 7:30p: back at Grey. They do have an a la carte special (running all day). Burger + drink for 25.000 CLP. Pizza + 2 drinks for 30.000 CLP. Not bad honestly‚Ä¶ Buffet style for paid dinner. Didn‚Äôt see what they were serving. Last night of backpacking food! Mini market: didn‚Äôt think prices were that bad, but definitely a premium. $3 for cookies. $3 for a ok size of chips.
* no community room, so everybody hangs out in the dining room instead. The charging strip is at the front desk, which is not convenient. Did not see outlets in my room.
* *Reflection*: Done one other glacier hike in New Zealand and this was much more intimate. I think  this one is more extensive w/ more hiking. But you are doing the same thing (walking on a glacier), so if you‚Äôre short on time / on a budget, fine to skip. but if you‚Äôve never been on one, definitely go for it!

**Grey to Puerto Natales**

* 7a: leave early to go to the second suspension bridge. Leave the big bag at the refugio. The map says 2 hours from the refugio. The first hanging bridge is 40 min away. Get to the 2nd hanging bridge at 8a... wouldn't say I'm that super fast of a hiker, so not sure about the map.
* 11a: leave Grey to go catch the catamaran
* 2:15: Get to Paine Grande. Hoping for an earlier catamaran, but the earliest one is 5p. Relax along with everybody else.
* \~5:30p: Reach Pudeto. Our bus (Bus Sur) is technically not until 7:30p, but hoping there‚Äôs an earlier bus we can hope on. There‚Äôs a bus there that says 7:15p. Everybody swarms the driver. He says we can get on. But we realize that he‚Äôs not leaving until the marked time‚Ä¶ I don't know if there's an earlier bus that leaves with the 5:30 ferry! doesn't make sense. Waiting for the buses to get more full??
* 7:15p: we leave, but it goes to Laguna Amarga, when I thought it would be heading to the next stop towards town...
* 10p: back in Puerto Natales. I don‚Äôt think we saved much time by getting on the 7:15p because we waited at Laguna for what felt like a while. Check in super late. There are still dinner places open late! But not a ton.

**Full day to tour to Perito Moreno Glacier from Puerto Natales**

Don't think most people do this, but if you have limited time (1 day), willing to spend, and want to see the glacier.. this Turismo Zaahj¬† bus tour is an option ($112 USD) + entry fee to Perito Moreno (at the time $30 USD).

* Bus ticket says departure at 6:45a. When I asked Turismo Zaahj at the bus station, they said 6:10 am and it departs from the office in town. Not the bus station itself. Interesting‚Ä¶
* 5:55a: get there.. and there are other people waiting at least. around 10 people end up on the tour
* get our passports checked before boarding bus (6:15a), bus leaves (6:30a)
* 7:15a: get to the border crossing.. we‚Äôre the first ones. Doesn‚Äôt open until 8a.
* 7:55a: bus driver tells us to get out and wait outside‚Ä¶ because of the time crunch he‚Äôs trying to get us to expedite this.
* 8a: the Chile exit control goes pretty quickly.
* 8:30a: now we‚Äôre at the Argentina border control.
* \~12p: get into El Calafate and pick up the guide. She explains a lot about the glacier and the fauna. The town looks cute. I heard a lot of people dragging it saying there‚Äôs nothing to do. Seems like a bigger version of Puerto Natales.
* 1:30p: Get to Perito Moreno Glacier. The guide buys the entrance tickets for some people. Already got ours in advance. Some people decide to the boat tour where you can get very close to the glacier. Guide recommends the red and yellow trails. There‚Äôs also a blue trail. The yellow one is the main one.
* Get a chicken sandwich from the cafe ($14.43). I think the menu is pricey like \~$15 USD for sandwiches!! Same w/ the souvenir store.
* bus leaves to go pick up the people finishing up the boat tour (3:15p). Leave the park around 3:30p.
* Stop at Esperanza for gas fill up. Only town between Puerto Natales and El Calafate.¬†
* 10p: back in Puerto Natales 30 minutes earlier than I expected!
* *Reflection:* I‚Äôm glad I asked about the departure time. Doesn‚Äôt make sense that they wouldn‚Äôt communicate. I found their WhatsApp number to be hit or miss. Sometimes they wouldn‚Äôt reply to messages / you needed to follow up.
* I thought about bus to El Calafate then renting a car. Bus to El Calafate then taxi. Renting a car from Puerto Natales and doing the full drive. All of those options were more slightly more expensive, but would‚Äôve gave us more time.. but it would‚Äôve required a one night stay in El Calafate that would‚Äôve taken time away from other stuff we wanted to do. That‚Äôs why I decided on the full day tour. Of course I wish we had more time (it was less than 2 hours), but I feel like it was decent‚Ä¶ The full day tour is definitely not cheap though.

**Puerto Natales:1.5 hours  horseback riding and Cueva de Milodon**

* Horseback riding  at 10a with¬†[Entre Aperos y Calafates](https://entreaperosycalafates.cl/en/services/#horseriding) ($50 USD)
* ¬†[Rental Natales](https://rentalnatales.cl/)¬†to pick up car. it‚Äôs a Subaru hatchback (9:15a). They were one of the few that did 1 day car rental! It was pricier than other options, but other places had minimums.
* 9:30a: The schedule is tighter than I‚Äôd like and the lady explains the stuff in the car in the detail: where the flat tire is, where the registration is, parking brake etc. Not used to this at all. Get to the place at 9:50a. 10:30-12 horseback riding. I'm a complete beginner!! never been horseback riding and they were great and patient w/ explaining everything.
* Cueva del Milodon is definitely skippable... I agree w/ what people say online! left at 1 and took 2.5 hours maybe? for all 3 caves. Tours/taxis are 50.000 CLP for 2 hours
* Bus to Punta Arenas (7p). Arrive at 10p.
* *Reflection*: [Pingo Salvaje](https://pingosalvaje.com/en/horseback-rides-in-patagonia/)¬†at Laguna Sofia is the really popular one that a lot of people go to; I think the group would be much bigger, so I loved the intimacy of Entre. Also it was slightly cheaper. Considered¬†[Galope Austral](https://www.galopeaustral.cl/en/programas/), which is similar pricing as Pingo for a 3 hour ride.

**Isla Magdalena for penguins**

* 2 hour boat ride to the island, 1 hour on the island w/ the penguins‚Ä¶  $86 USD
* Uber to Terminal Tres Puentes to catch the 9:30a sailing to Isla Magdalena.
* They tell us to be back at the boat by 12:30p. There‚Äôs a paved / roped path on the island. You can see the penguins pretty closely, but they aren‚Äôt very big. The guides stop us when a penguin crosses the path. There are also a BUNCH of sea gulls. The guide walks with the front of the group. Some people lag behind. We stop and regroup at the lighthouse. The path after the lighthouse has considerably less penguins than the first half.
* 2:30p back to Punta Arenas, uber back to city
* Airport is 20 minutes from the city.¬† There are like 3 gates. But if you need to drop baggage, go earlier. It took a WHILE even with 2 agents working.
* 9p flight to Santiago. Land at 12:15a.. stayed at hotel near the airport w/ free shuttle. get in at 1:30a

**Valparaiso**

* Didn't end up doing a tour due to time limitations, but I recommend it.. Maybe I was being paranoid‚Ä¶ but I could see those empty alleyways and staircases being targets for thieves. Especially because it felt so empty. In another city, I wouldn‚Äôt have hesitated though. People did say Cerro Concepcion and Cerro Allegre were fine..
* Maybe in hindsight skip it for another day trip from Santiago.

**Other reflections**

* I don't recommend Yagan House in Puerto Natales. Actually booked this through a recommendation here!! Booked through a 3rd party and they didn't get the reservation (yes I know this happens), but I don't think they handled the situation very professionally to help me solve it...
* Having a car would've made it easier to move from Central to Pudeto vs having to wait for the bus!! Can start the French Valley hike sooner too.
* If you read any Chile tips, they all say don‚Äôt lose the PDI slip. It‚Äôs not the end of the world if you do because¬†[you can get a new one](https://pdivirtual.cerofilas.gob.cl/etapas/ver/37773067/0), but it‚Äôs another hassle to deal with.
* Allot time for border control when LEAVING Chile during peak season. Took 1h and 10 minutes‚Ä¶ and then < 10 min for security.
* People said LatAM chile site was cheaper than the .com website. I must be dumb or something but it was the same price for me.
   * Booked the Chile domestic flights in July. I don‚Äôt think prices moved that much when I checked back in Sept. I think booking 3 months out would be fine.. Made a time change in November and seats were getting limited like 1-2 seats left on the plane.
* Spanish is going to be helpful of course, but I think you could definitely get by without it. Bus drivers, probably about half of the servers of places we went to, Uber drivers don‚Äôt speak Spanish
* Took out 40.000 CLP cash total for two people and had 5.000 CLP + some change leftover. Chile is heavy on credit card usage! Probably closer to 8.000 if it wasn't for a BIP card mishap.
   * The biggest thing was paying for the Laguna Amarga shuttle. So if you‚Äôre booking this in advance, you don‚Äôt need as much cash. (I did not use this link, but saw people posting it after my trip.)
* BIP card (public transpot): Buying BIP at Parajitos station is cash only. You can buy it with credit card at the airport, but you need to go to the station - it‚Äôs not inside the terminal. Ubers are cheap, so I see why people don't bother

1lnvglb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lnvglb/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_roommates_damaged/,AITA for refusing to pay for my roommate‚Äôs damaged laptop while he was watching our dog?,"My husband and I were out of town this week and left our dog with our roommate (who is also my husband‚Äôs best friend of over a decade). We offered to pay him to dog-sit, but he declined and said he was happy to help.

Our dog is well-behaved but a burrower‚Äîhe often digs into the couch cushions and moves things around when getting comfortable. Our roommate knows this.

One day while we were gone, our roommate pulled the coffee table up close to the couch (something he tends to do) and had his laptop and an open beer on it. While our dog was burrowing, a couch cushion shifted and knocked the beer over, spilling it onto the laptop. The beer wasn‚Äôt knocked directly by the dog‚Äîjust the cushion.

Now the laptop is damaged, and our roommate has asked us to pay for it in full. He says that it ‚Äúcould‚Äôve happened either way,‚Äù regardless of the table setup, and that it wouldn‚Äôt have spilled if our dog hadn‚Äôt been there.

We feel like this was completely preventable. He created a vulnerable situation by putting an open drink next to expensive electronics right where a dog‚Äîespecially one he knows burrows‚Äîwas lounging. We weren‚Äôt even home. He knew the risks and still chose that setup.

We feel bad that his laptop was damaged, but we don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for us to pay the full cost when the damage wouldn‚Äôt have happened without his choices. He disagrees and feels strongly that we should take full responsibility.

So‚ÄîAITA?

This post/ freelance short  is dedicated to the many of us who are about to venture (or have ventured) back to work. If you‚Äôre in a male dominated field like I am, it‚Äôs EXTRA dedicated to you. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see you! How are you doing?‚Äù he asks in the doorway, wearing a freshly pressed suit his wife undoubtedly prepared for him and an easy grin that says ‚Äúthe hardest obstacle to my morning was a two minute train delay.‚Äù

I pause to consider. As I do, I can feel the pad soaking with my intermittent bleeding which hasn‚Äôt seemed to stop since I restarted birth control. Pants were already tight with my new C Section shelf and postpartum weight gain pushing the limits of the waistband. Did I brush my teeth this morning? I think back to 6 am, when I‚Äôd already been up for three hours with the baby and put her down for five minutes to wash my face before screams recommenced.

Husband and I have barely spoken in the last two days, since we do kid shifts and the baby allows no one to rest peacefully while on hers. The last time we did, I was yelling at him for leaving me with all the bottles to wash before bedtime. We haven‚Äôt been intimate since before I was 20 weeks pregnant and diagnosed with placenta previa. We feel more like friends at this point.

I haven‚Äôt seen friends without a child present in almost four months, I realize. It‚Äôs simply been too difficult to leave her with my crippling postpartum anxiety combined with her difficult nature. I may need to up my Lexapro again.

As I‚Äôm turning my computer monitor on, I wonder for the sixth time that hour if baby might be coming down with her first daycare illness. Why did she eat even less than normal this weekend? ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù is barely cutting it as it is. Should we have pursued the tongue tie surgery? Do we need to go back to feeding every two hours? Will daycare make sure she eats well today, even though she will colic scream in their faces for hours? Am I getting a call from daycare in ten minutes that will force me to cancel yet another deposition? Making leadership question whether I can really do this job now that I have two?

Wait, did I remember to schedule the toddler‚Äôs next physical? I think I saw that email  reminder yesterday. Or was it last week? Her hair should probably be cut soon. Guilt pangs deep in my gut for how little time I‚Äôve spent with her lately.

I grab my large coffee and prepare to chug a large swig to try and trick my body into thinking it slept more than 4-5 cobbled together, anxiety stricken hours. Oh god. Is that smell me? Did I remember to swipe deodorant on while holding the baby in one arm and smearing under eye makeup on with the other? Shit, I forgot her extra outfit for daycare too. 

‚ÄúSorry, did you not hear me? How have you been?‚Äù

I plaster on my most winning smile. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm alright! Thanks for asking!‚Äù

1lnv5rh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnv5rh,Signed Book 133: From Tagore to Tree Fights: When Guha Got Me Thinking Green (and Guilty),"After yesterday‚Äôs post on 'Savaging the Civilized', I‚Äôm sticking with the Guha groove today; this time with the third signed copy in my collection: 'Speaking with Nature'. I picked up this copy from the beautiful Kitab Khana in Mumbai, where Guha had dropped by for a book event in December 2024. What‚Äôs more, it got read before I even got my hands on it, by none other than my mother-in-law! And her enthusiastic thumbs-up meant I had to bump it up my ever-growing ‚Äúto-read‚Äù tower.

Now, I‚Äôve always fancied myself as someone who cares deeply about nature conservation. We use solar power at home, harvest rainwater, avoid plastic when we can, and I frequently argue against air-conditioning. (Let‚Äôs not talk about my carbon-heavy work flights though, Guha might be taking notes.) But as Guha gently points out in the book, mine is ‚Äúfull-stomach environmentalism‚Äù; the luxury to care for the environment once your basic needs are met. Ouch, but fair.

'Speaking with Nature' is not your usual hand-wringing about melting glaciers and guilt-laced statistics. Instead, Guha takes us on a walk through history, introducing ten remarkable thinkers who were ecologists long before the word became fashionable. From Tagore‚Äôs warnings about unthinking industrialisation to Verrier Elwin‚Äôs deep bond with tribal communities (he‚Äôs back from yesterday‚Äôs post!) and Mira Behn‚Äôs early alarm bells over pine plantations replacing native Himalayan forests, this is a book rich in insight and layered with historical nuance.

Reading about Mira Behn‚Äôs concerns from nearly a century ago felt especially relevant. I grew up near the Western Ghats, and I‚Äôve seen firsthand how native trees are being swapped for fast-growing commercial species. It‚Äôs like the forest department‚Äôs motto is: ‚ÄúA tree is a tree, what‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù Turns out, the problem is biodiversity, water retention, soil health; basically everything. Mira Behn saw it coming. We just didn‚Äôt listen.

The book is not preachy, it‚Äôs reflective, well-researched, and above all, deeply Indian in context. It reminds us that India‚Äôs environmentalism wasn‚Äôt born in air conditioned conference rooms but in dusty villages, forest paths, and in poetry.

If you're someone who has ever said, ‚ÄúI love nature‚Äù while sipping coffee at a hill station, this book will challenge you, in a good way.

I don‚Äôt wanna do keto anymore just because of how restrictive it is. However I wanna do low carb (under 100g net carbs) and I made a whole plan.

Morning- coffee with almond milk

Lunch- 3 cups salad mix with 1/2 lb grilled chicken breast and 5 tbs lite Caesar dressing  

Dinner- same as lunch 

Snacks

-more coffee/almond milk

-big bag of mini carrots

-4-6 hard boiled eggs

-if still craving something, a protein bar

Without the protein bar 1350 cal/ 70g net carbs

With protein bar 1550 cal/87 net carbs

Potassium 4500mg and sodium 5000(I know is high but I heard it‚Äôs fine because it‚Äôs low carb)

And 8-12 cups of water

Now I know this seems like a weird plan but the thing is I like simplicity. My goals are to lose fat, lose weight, gain muscle, have clear skin, and hopefully feel physically better and more energy. I‚Äôll be working out doing cardio and weights. How would I feel eating like this? How would my skin react? I‚Äôve had hormonal breakouts the past year and I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs my diet. Would my energy and skin be significantly improved? I‚Äôm just curious because keto people swear that they feel amazing and the benefits are amazing and their skin looks amazing but then I hear from others about the bad smell, the low energy, the restriction and the fact that if you eat carbs, you‚Äôll probably binge and feel horrible because you‚Äôre so used to practically no carbs. 

I tried keto before and I got addicted to artificial sweeteners on keto which made me binge more, but that never happened to me with artificial sweeteners before. For example, now, I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to fake sugar if I have it but on keto, oh lord it was something else. I think the extreme carb restriction did something to me and just made my eating disorder worse which is why I think it‚Äôs a bad idea. But I‚Äôm more curious of this because people on keto say low carb will make you feel horrible since you‚Äôre in the middle by getting energy from carbs, but restricting carbs and also not being in ketosis. I always feel jealous of how some people on keto speak about how amazing their energy and skin is.

Here‚Äôs the criteria I‚Äôm looking for:

1. Must be a place with lots of beautiful women. So I can socialize and hopefully break into their friends group overtime. This is a best strategy for finding a compatible partner in my opinion. I'm just in need of some female friends at this time. Maybe they can help me find someone special, I really don't know...

I know they (attractive women) go to some exotic cafes or bars to get their instagram photos taken but it‚Äôs likely that in those environments it‚Äôs more cold approach than warm‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt do well with cold approach personally. 

I‚Äôm thinking maybe a dance studio where we meet everyday or every other day and this dance group will be my ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù. Show up, make friends, and they have no choice but to see you everyday, which leads to them actually acknowledging your presence and existence. You really can‚Äôt do this on a dating app or with cold approach a random person. To actually be in their physical personal space is only way to make real actual friends.

I guess the point of this post is to find a legitimate workaround to dating apps and cold approaching. For reference, cold approach is done at places like coffee shops, parks, produce aisle, walking down the street, etc. places where you will likely NEVER meet her again‚Ä¶
Another thing... I am above average looking guy and fit/ stylish. So yeah I'm not here for self improvement, I have enough confidence to approach but I'm interested in warm approach not cold approach.

So where do you guys go for ‚ÄúWARM approach?‚Äù 
I‚Äôm considering a dance studio or a cooking class or maybe even healing/ meditation class, if any of those things even exist and meet regularly every day‚Ä¶ can anyone give more insight on this?

Asymmetrical slanted ceilings with faux beams, fire place center piece and adjacent kitchen. We don‚Äôt utilize the space as our living room with TV, that is adjacent to this one. We are looking to decorate this as more of a comfy conversation room.  

We have already chosen more of desert colored theme and tried positioning some furniture and rug around the fire place. 

Q1A: (and main reason for this post): what style of console table would fit best behind the couch? Approx 38‚Äù wide and 39.5‚Äù height floor to bottom of larger art piece? Love colorful or subdued tones. Can we make this space work for vinyls and speakers (or is that best suited on opposite wall where dark bookshelf currently lives, see Q4)? 

Q1B: Should we add in a large arched lamp back there? Maybe hang a single or trio of Akari paper pendant lamps from the ceiling? Floating shelves above the plants on the right?

Q2: what should we put in the final corner of the rug? Large knitted pouf (patterned, solid?), another chair, or nothing?

Q3: ready to replace this awesome solid wood coffee table with something a bit more size appropriate; any color, shape, or material suggestions? Will add tray and items later. 

Q4: what to do with this larger (and much more visible) wall? Should this be a better bookshelf wall? Can I do an arched bookshelf with this shape of roof? Maybe I can put vinyl player and speakers on this side along with some books and decorations?
