Hi everyone,

I’ve been brewing with a Moka Pot for the last two months and I'm trying to really dial in my technique. I feel like my brews are okay, but I’m noticing some aggressive sputtering during the flow, and I suspect my grind consistency is the issue.

I’ve attached photos of my grind, the puck preparation, the residue, and a video of the extraction. I would love to hear feedback from all the pros out there.

My Equipment:

* Brewer: Bialetti Moka Express (3-Cup)
* Grinder: Generic Manual Hand Grinder (Ceramic Burrs) currently set to setting/number ""10""
* Beans: Blue Tokai Silver Oak (Medium Roast, Roasted Nov 6th)

My Recipe/Workflow:

* Coffee Dose: 17g
* Water: 136g (filled to just below the safety valve)
* Prep: I fill the basket to the top and level it off without tamping.
* Heat: Gas stove (I try to keep the flame low).

The Issues/Questions I have:

1. The Grind Consistency (See Photo 1 & 2): Since I'm using a ceramic burr grinder, I'm getting a mix of large ""boulders"" and fine dust. I’m currently on setting ""10"". Does this look too coarse for a Moka pot? I feel like the lack of uniformity is causing issues.
2. The Extraction (See Video): Around the 6-second mark of the flow, the brew starts bubbling and sputtering violently, even though the liquid is still pale. Is this purely a heat management issue, or is the coarse grind letting the water rush through too fast?
3. The Residue (See Photo 4): After brewing, the water left in the bottom chamber is a very dark amber color. Is this amount of backflow normal?
4. Taste: The result feels uneven. It often tastes a bit sour or watery, lacking the body I expect.

Any advice on how to manage the grind with this type of grinder, or tips on my heat control, would be appreciated!

**GitHub Copilot:** The daily driver for code. Handles context and repo-level tasks better than pasting into a chat window. Essentially makes a standalone chatbot for coding redundant.



**Perplexity:** King of search. Replaces the ""browsing"" need completely. Faster and more precise than GPT browsing.



**Gemini 3 (The Value King):** Not because it's necessarily ""smarter,"" but the math is undeniable.

* **ChatGPT:** $20/mo (Solo)
* **Google One:** \~$3.33/mo (Split 6 ways via Family Share)

  
Google quietly lifted the family restrictions. You get Gemini Advanced + 2TB storage for the price of a coffee.



TL;DR: Ditched ChatGPT. The 1M context on Gemini is insane. With Copilot handling the dev work, I can't justify burning $20/mo just for the brand name.



Just a heads up: You have to manually turn off data training in Google's settings (it's hidden in ""Gemini Apps Activity""), but worth it for the savings.

I was half knowing it would come since I'm on the end of my bc period (stopped taking the pill on Sunday) and I always had a headache at this time before. Not fun but ok.

After the shower. Oh boy. World went upside down. Dizzy, fatigue, shaking, nausea. Am I in shock because of the pads? Is the advil empty stomach is a new no no?

1p8vnie,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1p8vnie/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I don't even know how to process this so I'm just going to type it out.

I'm 28F, my sister Elsa is 22F. We're in Stockholm. Our parents are Gunnar and Birgit and I always thought they were pretty fair with us growing up. Maybe I was wrong.

So for the past two years I've been saving for a trip to Japan. It's been my dream since I was a teenager. I'm a children's book illustrator so I don't make amazing money but I've been budgeting hard. Skipping coffees, not buying new clothes, meal prepping every week. I've saved about 45,000 SEK which is like almost $4,300 USD.

I was so proud of myself. I'm finally booking the trip for April.

Yesterday my parents announced in our family group chat that they're giving Elsa 45,000 SEK as a graduation gift for finishing her certificate program.

A six month certificate program. In like. Office administration or something.

When I graduated from university with my illustration degree - four years of work - they took me to dinner and gave me a card with 500 SEK in it.

I called my mom to ask about it. Tried to stay calm. Asked why the difference.

She said it's ""not the same situation."" That Elsa ""struggled more"" with school and they wanted to ""celebrate her finally finishing something."" That I ""always had it easier academically"" so I didn't need the same encouragement.

I didn't have it EASIER. I worked part time through my entire degree. I took out loans. I just didn't complain about it constantly like Elsa does.

So basically I'm being punished for not being a mess??

I told my mom this felt really unfair and she got defensive. Said I was ""making this about money"" and that she thought I'd be ""happy for my sister.""

I AM happy for her. But I'm also hurt?? Those two things can exist at the same time??

Elsa texted me later saying she heard I was ""upset about her gift"" and that she's ""sorry I feel that way."" Not sorry about the situation. Sorry I FEEL that way.

I've been crying on and off since yesterday. Two years of sacrifice and discipline and they just hand her the same amount like it's nothing. Like my effort means nothing.

My dad hasn't said anything. He never does when mom makes decisions. I don't even know if he agrees or if he just doesn't want to fight about it.

Am I being petty about money or is this actually unfair?

# **Update - 2 days later**

[**UPDATE: My parents are giving my sister the same amount of money I saved for two years as a graduation gift**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p7aqcv/update_my_parents_are_giving_my_sister_the_same/)

I posted a few days ago about my parents giving my sister Elsa 45,000 SEK for finishing a 6-month certificate program when I got 500 SEK for completing a 4-year university degree. A lot of you told me I wasn't being petty and that the favoritism was real. I needed to hear that.

Here's what happened.

I decided to talk to my dad directly. He usually stays out of things but I thought maybe one-on-one he'd be honest with me. I asked him to meet me for coffee yesterday.

I laid it all out. The difference in gifts. The years of feeling like Elsa got more support. The ""she struggled more"" justification that basically punishes me for being responsible.

He was quiet for a long time. Then he said something that broke me.

""Your mother and I always knew you'd be fine. You're the strong one. Elsa needs more help. That's just how it is.""

I'm the strong one. So I get less. Because they decided when I was a kid that I didn't need them the same way.

I asked him if he realized that ""being strong"" meant I just stopped asking for help because I knew I wouldn't get it. That I worked 25 hours a week through university while Elsa's part-time job was ""too stressful"" so they covered her expenses. That I've been financially independent since I was 22 while they still pay Elsa's phone bill.

He looked uncomfortable. Said he ""never thought about it that way.""

That's the problem. They never thought about it at all.

I told him I wasn't angry about the money specifically. I was angry about what it represented. A lifetime of being the kid they didn't worry about, which translated into being the kid they didn't invest in.

He said he'd talk to my mom.

Last night my mom called. I thought maybe she'd apologize. Maybe dad got through to her.

Instead she said I had ""upset your father"" by ""making him feel guilty"" and that I needed to ""let this go"" because it was ""ruining Elsa's celebration.""

Elsa's celebration. Still not about me at all.

I told my mom I needed some space. That I loved them but I couldn't pretend this didn't hurt. She said I was ""being dramatic"" and ""holding a grudge over money"" and that she ""raised me better than this.""

I haven't responded. I don't know what to say.

Elsa texted me this morning. Not an apology. She said ""Mom told me you're upset about the money thing. I didn't ask them for it, they offered. It's not my fault they wanted to do something nice for me.""

She's right that she didn't ask. But she also didn't acknowledge that the disparity is real or that my feelings are valid. Just more ""sorry you feel that way"" energy.

I'm still going to Japan. I'm still proud of myself for saving that money on my own. But something has shifted. I think I finally see my family clearly. And I don't know if I can unsee it.

I have so many thoughts bouncing around my head 

how does one feel about this? I'm happy to give her closure if that's what she wants and it is what she wants seemingly but at the same time I still have so many feelings for her cuz I really love this girl because she's just so special and wonderful and just amazing you know? 

however if she wants closure or she doesn't want to hear that. she wants to hear that I'm okay without her and that things are okay and that were on the same page about breaking up. 

so is it wrong to lie? that way she won't feel bad about way it'll be giving her what she wants it'll be giving her closure?

I really care about her and as much as I'd love her to come back that's obviously not what she wants so maybe it's better for her if I just lie about my feelings I don't really know how these things work because I am very autistic but I truly just want the best for her. 

please read it just help me know what's best I'm asking here cuz I don't think r / BPD can help me because I want the perspective of an ex partner who I've hurt. 

I don't want pity I don't want people to tell me not to feel guilty I just want to know what's best for her I just want to know what could be the best outcome for her because I love her so much even if she hates me even if she's not with me anymore I still love her so ridiculously much and that leads to care and my care will outweigh my desire to get back together if it'll make her feel better

will probably meet up for coffee in a weekend or two and I just want to know what to say that'll be best for her because she said she wanted to closure cuz she thinks she feels like she needs closure which I'm happy to give her but I just don't know what the words to say are because I know what my true feelings are but she doesn't want to hear about my gushing love she doesn't want to hear that she wants us to be okay and be broken up

part of me is hurt by that but I don't want to show that to her I don't want her to know that I just want her to be okay 

I know she's frequented this sub but I have her Reddit account blocked just because I don't want her to see the posts about her cuz then she'd know I'm lying for her sake and that kind of defeats the purpose.

any advice is just so appreciated cuz I just want to do what's best for her

He ticks all the boxes: he's kind, caring, funny and there's a lot of sexual attraction and tension.

However, one small thing that has increasingly started to bother me is his relationship with his ex. For a bit of context, they met at university in first year and then they lived together in second year, where they started dating. From what I understand they dated for two years until fourth year, where, as a result of leaving uni, the distance made it difficult and it fizzled. There was no cheating or similar involved, but he was in love with her. 

Given they lived together, their uni friendship group was the same (they all lived together in one house). This meant they met up quite a few times after uni, and went away as a group together and similar. When they were both still single (after breaking up), my boyfriend has told me they hooked up during group-meet ups (usually always drunk).

This year, after we started dating, my boyfriend started a postgraduate course for a year and, surprise, surprise, the ex is there too. This means that they see each other at least three or four times a week, and he tells me that they grab coffee together and have a catchup as friends.

I have met her in a group situation when my boyfriend introduced me to his group, and she was really lovely, and I didn't get any signs there was anything going on with them or like there was any ""unfinished business"". 

Out of nosiness, I did read their messages (I know, I'm bad), and they do message quite frequently. Aside from a few jokes, which seem to be about group stuff I'm not aware of, they're mainly focused on uni talk and it seems very platonic.

This makes me think I'm overthinking it all and I'm overreacting; my boyfriend has given me no reason not to trust him and it's all perfect when we're together. He's been completely transparent with me about it as he didn't want it to come out and me be taken aback, which I feel is a green flag.

I also know that the ex is dating someone currently. However, I can't shake the feeling that hanging out with an ex with this much regularity is bound to cause something to stir up again.

I Planned MY Suicide. Then I Killed My Old Life.

A father’s story of alcoholism, a gun, and a chance at redemption.

There it was. That black shadow with the hissing voice: You’re done. You can’t do this anymore. Some men are winners and then there’s you. Fuck it. End it. Weak words. I don’t mean that they are words of weakness, I mean the words that you are reading on this page are a tiny maggot on the rotten ass of the elephant that was this voice.

I take another swallow of the brown liquid and a shiver lurches through me. As I put the pint-bottle back into my pocket, my mouth waters the way it does when a person might be about to vomit. I open my mouth and let the saliva roll freely over my bottom lip and onto the front of my shirt. I look into the mirror at what I think is me. I blame the sharp lighting in this bathroom for my yellow teeth and the dark, puffy pouches under my nicotine-spit-colored eyes.

I hate myself. Not because I’m a drunk. Not because I shit my pants five-minutes ago and I still haven’t cleaned myself up. No, I hate myself because of the coward in me that needs the drink to function. I hate my fear that other people will see me for what I know that I am. I hate that I’ve ran from things that other men who don’t seem to be too special themselves, have seemingly faced with little difficulty. I hate my unwillingness to try for something more, but I know that it’s all for nothing anyway. Everyone else catches breaks, but not me. I barely feel anything, or I feel too much of everything. There is no in-between.

This is me on the morning of my fortieth birthday, hiding in the bathroom of my house, while my wife and four kids are somewhere on the other side of the door, living their own lives without an inkling that I am contemplating the best way to go to sleep forever.

The thoughts have come and gone in the past three-weeks. That serpent’s lips just behind my ear: *They really will be better off without you. Sure, there will be some pain that goes with losing you, but they’ll get over that. It’s better than the living influence that you have on them now. Hell, one of these days you may end up killing all of you in one drunken car ride. What’s the point of it all? You never follow through with anything. You’ve never won anything. You have no talents. A man should be able to build something. Can you build anything? A man should be able to fix things. Is anything that you touch any better off after you try to mess with it? No.*

This might be a good spot to say something cliché like, “How did I get here?” Or, “How did it all go so wrong?”

But that would be bullshit.

For years I have taken a very specific road that could’ve only led to exactly where I am right now.

I spend every night waking up around 3 a.m., heaving, shaking, and rolling over to clutch whatever bottle I have stashed in the bottom drawer of my nightstand. I violently hold the sloshing bottle against my mouth to spill a couple of slugs down my throat instead of all over my torso. I’m usually good then, to have a smoke and shut my eyes for another two hours before my alarm goes off and it’s time to get ready for work.

Then the day begins…

I sit up and swallow whatever is left of the bottle in my nightstand drawer, and I put the empty pint into my work bag so I can throw it out somewhere on my way to work to avoid the presence of bottles in my trash at home. I shuffle down the hallway into the bathroom and relieve my bladder of its maple-colored contents and make my way to the kitchen.

I pour a cup of coffee and grab two of the four shooters that I have hidden behind the coffee maker. I down the shots using a swallow of coffee as a chaser and bury the empties into the trashcan underneath some used paper plates. I light a cigarette and drop the other two shooters into the pocket of my pajama pants so they will be close at hand when I am in the shower in case I vomit when the hot water and the panicky thoughts about the day ahead hit me. *You’re a fraud. This is NOT how a man acts. How long can you pretend to carry this on?*

Out of the shower and dressed, I brush my teeth making sure it is the last thing I do before I leave the house. (This often makes no difference at all as I may take a shot on my drive into work, in which case I will stop on the backroad on the way in and gargle some of the mouthwash that I keep in the middle console of my truck.)

Every day at the office is a constant act filled with anxiety, shame, and that same voice: *Your last drink was less than two-hours ago. Do you think they can’t smell it on you? Visine might get some of the redness out of your eyes, but they are still puffy and full of fear. You’re not fooling anybody. They’re talking about you in whispers and they think, that you think, that you’re getting away with this. They see you shaking even when you try to camouflage it with other movements , and you can’t deny your oily-red complexion. Trust me, you are not hiding it well.*

I go to the restroom once every two or three-hours, back to the farthest stall from the door, and I guzzle down a shooter or two to quiet some of the nerves and to stave off the inevitable sickness that will come if I do not follow this ritual.

I keep two liquors of choice for the workday:

1. Fireball-a cheap whiskey with a cinnamon flavor, the scent of which I believe I can cover up with Big Red chewing gum.
2. Vodka- most drunks choose willful ignorance in the belief that we can cover up the smell of vodka with just about anything.

Once I have taken my shots in the stall, I put the empty bottles in my pocket, pop some gum or a cough drop, and take care when I walk not to let the empties rattle around and give up my secret. I will make a few trips out to my truck to stash the empties and grab some fresh bottles throughout the day under the guise of grabbing something else such as a pack of smokes or any other excuse I come up with.

The workday having been survived, I start my drive home. I take a two-lane backroad in front of the office that runs parallel to the river where there is a tree-line on one side and a levee on the other. I wait until the office is about the size of a Lego in my rearview mirror and I break out the last two or three shooters and take my first couple of carefree drinks of the day and discard my empty bottles out the window into the tree-line on the roadside.

Lighting a cigarette, inhaling deeply, and exhaling all the stress of the past few hours, I think to myself, *I will drink less tonight and try to get to sleep a little earlier. That way, I’ll have had some decent sleep, even though I’ll wake up somewhere around 3 a.m. again, with my body screaming for a drink.*

I stop at the Pit Stop and grab what I need. A couple of sleeves of shooters and a pint of whiskey should get me through tonight and the workday tomorrow. I make small talk with the cashiers and do my best in the short conversation to act like a regular hard-working guy that is just grabbing some drinks to enjoy casually after work. The clerks are friendly enough, but they know I’m full of shit, and that I’ll be right back in here as soon as I get off tomorrow.

I call my wife on the way home and ask her if she needs anything while I’m out. On the days that she does need me to make a quick stop, I typically use that opportunity to grab a few more drinks, whether it is a half-pint or just a few shooters to rathole somewhere safe should I need them in a pinch. Pulling into my driveway, I pop a cough drop into my mouth and make sure that there are no visible bottles in my truck before going inside.

One of my girls has soccer practice tonight, and my youngest has gymnastics. My wife will take the gymnastics duty, and I agree to take soccer practice since it is held at a fantastic indoor facility that has a bar and grill. I blend in really well there with the majority of parents who also like to have a drink or two while their kid is running around for a couple of hours. It also means that I will not have to worry about reeking like alcohol for the rest of the night as my wife will just chalk it up to me having a couple of drinks at the practice and the few that I will have at home.

Once we are all back at home we have dinner and take our showers. The kids settle into bed, and I pour about three fingers of whiskey into my favorite glass. My wife and I talk to each other about our day and find something to watch on TV for an hour or two. I kiss her goodnight, and shuffle down the hall to the bedroom to lie in bed and scroll on my phone for about an hour before I pass out.

That’s it. Every day is the same.

The only variances may be:

1. Baseball or basketball practice instead of soccer and gymnastics.
2. Clowning around with the kids for a while.
3. House work that I have neglected that I will take too long to finish and no doubt piss and moan the entire time I’m doing it.
4. Me, ruining whatever show or movie we are watching because I am talking about work, or whatever sadness from my past that I choose to dwell on.
5. Sex with my wife instead of walking to bed alone.
6. Us arguing because of my insecurities and her perceived superiority complex.
7. Me damaging one or all of my children’s sense of security when they see their dad acting like a weak child.

I know that I will die a disgusting, humiliating death if I keep going down this road, but I’m not sure that my mind can take another alcohol cleanse. Ridiculously, this is not the first time that I have found myself in the same desperate spot.

I used to detox myself at home a couple of times a year when things would really get out of control. I guess it just got harder on me with age. I’ve added up countless days and nights of sweating, freezing, sickness, shaking my bones out of my skin, and laying in the cool wet swamp of nausea and toxicity. The feel of the sheets was like smearing Crisco all over my body and pulling dirty clothes on top of it. The voice was always there; not as strong or as often as it seems to be more recently, but there. You’re a worm in mud. I try like hell to focus for just ten seconds on one thing, but the horrific thoughts ricochet like seventeen ping-pong balls in my wooden skull. You’ll never be a man. God, the hallucinations! Hearing music coming from the heating vents in the floors and the oscillating fan in my room. Seeing shadows like ooze and smoke crawling around the walls, and rapid glimpses of movements like small birds and insects just in the corner of my eye. Not to mention the unending cycle of shame and anxiety that goes with staying locked in my room, puking in a trash can while my wife is taking on all the responsibilities of running our home by herself.

People think an alcoholic can quit with just a little bit of willpower, but that’s not it. Hell, even most functioning alcoholics think they know how bad it can get, but until they live it, shit…

I carried on with the above-mentioned routines for years until I finally broke down. One night, eight years ago, I resolved to tell my boss the next morning how I had been living and that I may need to take a few days off to get myself together. He took pity on me and consulted with some of the higher-ups of the company, and they secured me a bed at a local rehab facility. I was immediately sent to detox at a hospital before the rehab would even admit me due to my rattling, my yellow eyes, and sky-high blood pressure.

The medications at the hospital helped with the withdrawals a bit. Slowly getting my appetite back and being pumped full of good nutrients and being surrounded by like-minded people with many of the same afflictions, fears and hopes felt like a Godsend. For that moment in time I didn’t feel so isolated and alone. There were many others battling the same issues as me, but despite my low opinion of myself, I still couldn’t help but feel that my situation was just a little different from most of the others’.

When I got home, things went well for about three months. With a new morning routine, practicing mindfulness, and attending AA meetings a few times a week, things seemed to be getting better. I was a better man for my wife and a better father to my kids. For the most part the cravings and ever-existing triggers were still a daily struggle, but I could shake that shit off. *One day at a time.*

Then, I figured, with my newfound wisdom and coping mechanisms, I would be alright to have an occasional drink or two as long as I was doing it at appropriate times. A few drinks at get-togethers, or after work, turned into a few more, turned into a couple of whiskey shots with my coffee in the morning, then a couple more swallows just a few hours later, and so on, and spiral. Things carried on the same way for another six years until I had another breakdown and was fired from my job for “performance and attendance issues”.

That brings us right back to me being hunched over, leaning with both palms on either side of my sink, staring at the golem in the mirror crying, knowing that I am going to kill myself. I thought of driving my truck into the river, hanging myself, or jumping off the nearby bluffs, but I saw a flaw with each one of those methods. *You might not die if you drive into the river. You’re too much of a pussy to hang yourself. Jumping off the bluffs might leave you as a vegetable, but still living.*

A couple of days later, I was about as sick as I’d ever remembered being. I was wobbling like a baby deer and unable to keep any food down. From past experiences I knew that the hospital would be of no help to me as they had refused to admit me before due to smelling like alcohol, or answering “yes” when one of the nurses asked me if I drank more than occasionally. So I went to an Urgent Care located a few blocks from my house, and they looked me over and told me that I had pneumonia. I picked up the steroids and other medications that I was prescribed, mainly to show my wife that I must be legitimately sick if the doctor says I need meds. I went home to pack a bag and to tell my family that I was heading out to my dad’s house in the country to avoid spreading my sickness to them. I backed out of the driveway and drove down my street watching my youngest daughter waving in my rearview and knowing in my soul that I was going to shoot myself in the head back in the woods behind my father’s house.

Since you’re reading this, I guess there’s no need to tell you what I didn’t do. So I’ll tell you what I did. I drove to my dad’s house and talked with him. I told him about my having pneumonia and that I was quitting drinking. Then, I waited until he was out the next day, and I opened the drawer where he kept one of his pistols. I saw that the magazine was missing from the pistol, and I checked for a round in the chamber. I sat and thought for a few long minutes. I wondered if my father had suspected something and if that was why the magazine wasn’t in the pistol as it had been any other time. I thought about my family carrying on without me. I thought about how long I had felt so alone.

I made one phone call. They didn’t answer. I staggered out to the front porch and stared at the field across the road. My phone rang. I spoke honestly and didn’t hold back anything. The voice on the other end didn’t offer much sympathy, but they spoke these simple truths:

You’re not alone.

You’re isolating yourself, and only you really know why.

Even the ones that don’t like you very much right now still love you, and they want you to do better.

The ones that don’t want you to do better don’t matter.
 Nobody that loves you would be better off without you.

Stop breaking their hearts, and yours will start to heal as well.


It’s not weak to reach for help.

This is my call to the dad out there that may be going through something similar. You, man. Life is brutal, and it doesn’t come with a playbook for rough years. We are supposed to be the protectors and the providers, but when we’re locked inside ourselves, it makes it nearly impossible to give the necessary attention to our outside worlds. We might compare ourselves to our heroes and get stuck on ways that we don’t measure up, but remember that our heroes have their weak moments, too. If you constantly compare your inside to everyone’s outside, you’re gonna see some of the worst of you in contrast with some of the best of others.

# Part 2

 

(Sounds of rushing wind as Stormbird is flying at a rapid speed.)

 

Carol:  (Over an intercom.  Anxious.)  Stormy.  Stormy, come in. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Stormy, I know you can hear me, now answer me.  I haven’t been able to install GPS trackers in your new suit yet, but the comm system is just fine.  You can’t pretend that it’s still a work in progress, now would you please just answer me?

 

(Pause.)

 

Oh, thank God.  There you are.  Stormy, what’s gotten into you.  Why wouldn’t you answer me?

 

(Pause.)

 

And why would I try to turn you from this course of action, Stormy.  You wouldn’t be doing anything incredibly stupid and irresponsible, by any chance, would you?  Something completely and utterly ridiculous like trying to find Stormcloud on your own without any backup?

 

(Pause.)

 

Goddamn it, Stormy.  What the hell are you thinking?  Get back here this instant!

 

(Pause.)

 

Yes, I know the others on the team are at risk, and her powers are…

 

(Pause.)

 

Yes, I know she said she still cares about you, but…

 

(Pause.)

 

Dammit, Stormy, stop cutting me off.  Just because her powers don’t affect you doesn’t mean you should go in alone.  What if this is exactly what she wants and she’s got something else planned for you?  What if you’re walking into a trap?

 

(Pause.)

 

Well, it’s not a risk I’m willing to take. 

 

And besides, we haven’t been able to pinpoint her location.  We’ve only been able to surmise that she might be anywhere in a 500 mile radius somewhere in the American South West.  Even if going in alone was a good idea, this is a waste of time.  You’re never going to find her. 

 

(Pause.)

 

No, I do not accept that you have to try.  You turn around and get back here this instant.  Do you hear me?

 

(Pause.)

 

Stormy.  Stormy! 

 

UUUUGGGGGHHHHH! 

 

Ok, fine.  Have it your way.  There are no other pressing concerns at the moment so we don’t need you here right now, but…

 

Stormy… I need you here right now. 

 

(Pause.)

 

I just don’t want her getting in your head, Stormy.  If you do find her, I don’t want to see her manipulate you with her lies. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Yes, with her delusions.  I don’t want to lose you to her.  I don’t want to lose you to anybody. 

 

Stormy, tell me!  Tell me right now that you’ll never leave me. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Because I want to hear it again.  I always want to hear it from you.  I want to hear it from you every day.  I love you, Stormy.  Tell me that you’ll never leave me.

 

(Pause.)

 

(Worried.)  No, Stormy, say it.  I need to hear it. 

 

(Pause.)

 

(Calming down.)  Ok.  Thank you. 

 

(Irritated.)  But don’t argue with me next time.  I get worried that you’re considering not saying it. 

 

(Pause.)

 

What?  No, Stormy, don’t shut off your coms.  I want to hear what happens. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Yes, you’re right.  If she’s monitoring these frequencies, she’ll pick it up.  All right, go dark. 

 

But the moment you make contact, you let us know so we can support you. 

 

(Pause.)

 

(Calmly, tenderly, but with a hint of worry.)  Ok, Stormy.  Be safe.  I love you. 

 

(Sound of rushing wind continues briefly and then stops as Stormbird lands.  Slow footsteps on gravel as he walks tentatively examining his surroundings.  A door opens.  Another couple of footsteps inside.) 

 

Stormcloud:  Hi, Stormy. 

 

(Stormbird spins with surprise.)

 

Goodbye, Stormy.

 

(Hiss from some sort of gas or a sudden small explosive “poof” type of sound.)

 

(Time-lapse.)

 

(Sing-song voice.)  Stooooormyyyyy?  Stooooooooormyyyyyyy?  You coming out of it, yet? 

 

Heeeeey, there you are.  Hiya, sleepyhead. 

 

(Calming Stormbird’s panic.)  No, no, no.  Shh, shh, shhhhh.  You’re fine, Stormy.  You’re ok.  Nothing’s wrong.  You’re still a little woozy from what I hit you with.  That’s all.  It will fade quickly as you come to.  Just take it slowly, ok? 

 

That’s it.  Shake it off.  Starting to feel better?

 

(Pause.)

 

Good.  Gooooood.  I’ll stay with you while you shake this off. 

 

(Pause.)

 

This?  This is my trailer.  We’re in a trailer park somewhere in Arizona. 

 

(Pause.)

 

No, I’m not going to tell you exactly where.  Not quite yet.  Maybe later.  We’ll see how things go. 

 

(Pause.)

 

(Shocked.  Confused.)  Excuse me?  Kill you?    

 

(Upset.  Annoyed.)  Stormy?  Seriously?  How could you think I’d ever be capable of doing something like that to you? 

 

Stormy, do you remember me telling you before that one of my foster parents was an assistant fire chief, and that he told me that he never, EVER wanted to hear me say the word that begins with F, ends in U, C, K, and isn’t “Firetruck.”

 

(Pause.)

 

Good.  Then what the firetruck kind of question was that? 

 

Ugh.  No.  Back up.  We’re not starting off like this.  I’m not going to be upset with you.  None of this is your fault.

 

All I’m asking is that you think about what you just said.  Why would you ask me something like that?  Do you really think I could ever hurt you? 

 

(Pause.)

 

Of course, I’m serious. 

 

(Pause.)

 

No, no, no.  Stop right there.  Don’t tell me about the factory in Delaware, the logging community in Oregon, or about how I incinerated a coffee shop in Manhattan.  Think about who I am.  Think about all of our time together snuggled up in each other’s arms.  Think about all of the sweet kisses and the even sweeter puppy love conversations we had that centered around themes of “You’ll always be mine,” and “I’ll love you forever,” and then ask yourself if what you just asked was a fair question.

 

(Pause.)

 

(Sadly admitting.)  Ok, that truly is fair.  I did leave you.  And I never tried to reconnect with you.

 

(Pause.)

 

Oh, God, Stormy, I hoped beyond hope that you’d somehow intuitively understand.  I hoped that you knew I still loved you.  I hoped that you’d see beyond the stories I knew they’d give you, when the truth was…

 

No.  It’s not time for that yet.  You’re not fully awake. 

 

Tell you what.  Let’s start over.  Let’s pretend we’re like we’re 16 again.  We’ve both just arrived at the barracks after being recruited and we’ve run into each other for the first time, each of us a little bit smitten by the other. 

 

Hi.  My name is… well, I don’t know what my name is, but you can call me Stormcloud.  And you are? 

 

(Pause.)

 

Nice to meet you, Stormbird.  Since we’re just meeting each other for the first time ever, is there anything you’d like to ask me? 

 

(Pause.)

 

Nope.  You’re not tied up.  Why would I tie up a complete stranger that I’ve never met before and I’m having a conversation with for the first time? 

 

(Coyly.)  Unless you’d like me to bring up all of the roleplays that I know you’re going to love a few years from now. 

 

(Pause.)

 

(Laughs.)  All right, all right, I won’t go there.  We’re starting over.  I know nothing about you or your love for roleplays.  My turn to ask a question.  How are you feeling?

 

(Pause.)

 

Very good.  I’m glad.  Your turn. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Your suit has been smashed, shredded, eviscerated, incinerated, and the ashes urinated on for good measure to make sure there were no tracers that could find you where I was taking you.  Ok, admittedly, urinating on the ashes was completely out of spite, but that’s why you’re lying naked in my bed.  Or rather, almost naked.

 

(Which a mischievous smile in her voice.)  Which leads me to my next question; When did you start wearing underwear underneath your outfit? 

 

(Pause.)

 

Ok, fair enough.  That’s not a question somebody meeting you for the first time would ask.  Unless, of course, you were meeting me for the first time, but I was admitting to being a super-fan stalker with hidden cameras in your home and an obsessive need to be as close to you as possible at all times. 

 

Don’t roll your eyes at me.  You know as well as I do that that’s happened to both of us.  It’s a legitimate possibility.  But, for the sake of what we’re doing right now, I’ll concede the point and ask something else. 

 

How did you know exactly where to look for me? 

 

(Pause.)

 

(A touch of sadness.)  Oh.

 

(Pause.)

 

No, I’m glad you got my coded message, but… I don’t know.  I guess I was hoping that your answer would be something more along the lines of that you could just feel me.  That we were connected somehow in a special way that nobody else could come between. 

 

Sorry.  That’s just a silly girl lost in a fairy tale I guess. 

 

Ok, your turn.  Ask me anything.

 

(Pause.)

 

No.  I’m not seeing anybody.  I’ve… sort of had a bit of a falling out with someone very special to me.  You see, he doesn’t understand that I’ve been doing some incredibly crazy things because I love him and I’m trying to protect him.  I think he feels that I betrayed him, but… I’ve never stopped loving him and I hope one day that he sees that. 

 

What do you think?  Would that make for a better sit-com plot or a Hallmark movie of the week? 

 

(Pause.)

 

Really?  I’m not sure anybody would pay current theater prices to see something like that. 

 

So… what about you?  Are you seeing anybody at the moment?

 

(Pause.)

 

(Sorrowfully.)  No.  I understand. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Really, Stormy, I get it.  You felt like I’d left you in a bad place… in a very bad place, in a very bad way.  You must have been devastated. 

 

(Pause.)

 

I’m sorry, Stormy.  I never wanted that.  Please know that I had a good reason for doing what I did.  For what I’m continuing to do. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Aw, to hell with all of that starting over crap.  You need to know how sorry I am that you went through all of that alone.  I wanted to be there every single moment, Stormy.  I wanted to be there with you.  I wanted to tell you the truth.  To be honest, if it weren’t for your powers that disable mine, I probably would have burst in, knocked you out, tied you up, and gotten you out of there before you had a chance to object. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Well, you could have objected all you’d wanted after that.  I’d have had you tied up. 

 

(Pause.)

 

I couldn’t.  I couldn’t have simply come back and talked to you about what had happened, about what I’d experienced, without almost definitely killing you; killing both of us.  And then they would have gotten away with it. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Nope.  No more of that right now.  You’re awake, but you’re still dizzy from the drugging I gave you in order to get you here safely.  I’ll wait to explain more until you can handle it.  Right now, you just need to know that I’m not upset with you for moving on.  It must have been worse than if you’d thought I’d died.  Your love not only rejected you but became a super-villain terrorizing the globe.  You turned to a soothing voice and a soft touch for comfort. 

 

Tell me, who was it?  Diane in accounting?  Or did you hook up with Lilac.  She’s sweet.  And I never told you, but she confessed to me on one mission that she’d always had a crush on you and that she’d make her move if I was ever out of the picture.  And with your love for roleplays, and her plant-based powers, she would have made things very fun with vines.  It’s Lilac, isn’t it. 

 

(Pause.)

 

No, Stormy.  What happened wasn’t your fault.  You can tell me.  I promise.  I won’t be angry.  I swear. 

 

(Pause.)

 

(NOTE:  The following is intended to have comical, humorous overtones, but you can play it however you’d like.)

 

WHAT!?!  CAROL!?!  YOU’RE SLEEPING WITH CAROL!!!!!????!!!!!

 

(Pause.)

 

I KNOW WHAT I JUST SAID ABOUT NOT GETTING ANGRY, BUT, CAROL!!??!!  WHAT THE LITERAL HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!???!!!  OH MY GOD!!!!  SHE’S THE LITERAL DEVIL!!!!! 

 

(Pause.)

 

DON’T YOU DEFEND HER NOW!!!  IT’S BAD ENOUGH THAT YOU DEFENDED HER WHEN I TRIED PUTTING A FINAL STOP TO HER EVIL!!  DON’T YOU DARE DEFEND HER WITH YOUR… WORDAGES, AND YOUR… OTHER… THINGS!!!

 

AAAAAUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!  I CAN’T EVEN ENGLISH STRAIGHT NOW!!!!

 

CAROL!?!  THE LITERAL EMBODIMENT OF EVIL!!!!

 

(Pause.)

 

NO, I WILL NOT STOP OVERUSING THE WORD “LITERAL.”  FOR ONE THING, I HAVEN’T OVERUSED IT!!  SHE IS LITERALLY THE…

 

(Banging at her front door.)

 

WHAT!?!

 

(Pause.)

 

(Calming down, but annoyed.  Calling out to the person at the front door loudly, but not angrily screaming anymore.)  No, everything’s ok, Mrs. Randolph.  I was just watching a rerun of “The Bachelor” and I got a little too carried away.  You know how I can get.

 

(Pause.)

 

(Still loudly.)  Yep.  I knew you’d understand.  Sorry if I got too loud.  I’ll shut it off.  I need to get back to work on that backup generator anyway.    

 

(Pause.)

 

(Still loudly.)  No, no.  Thanks for checking up on me, Missy.  You’re a peach. 

 

(To Stormbird.  Not loudly anymore.  Begins with an annoyed sigh.)  Sorry about that.  That was Mrs. Randolph.  She lives in the trailer next door with her husband and her 23-year-old son.  He graduated from college with a pottery degree a month ago and still hasn’t found a job.  Go figure.  She’s not so subtly trying to hook me up with him. 

 

I’m… I’m going to head outside for a bit.

 

(Pause.)

 

No, Stormy, it’s not safe for you to be around me right now. 

 

Well, ok, it’s not safe for anybody else if you’re around me right now.  I need to be alone to blow off some steam and you need some more time to let the drugs wear off.  And I wasn’t lying when I said I needed to work on the generator.  It’s been acting up recently, and as hot as it’s been lately, if the power goes out, we’re going to have a lot of elderly people in this trailer park with no air conditioning.  I can kill two birds with one stone by making sure it’s up and running properly. 

 

(Pause.)

 

No, Stormy, I mean it.  It’s not wise for me to stay in here with you right now.  Give me a breather. 

 

If you want to rest some more, go ahead.  Whenever you feel like getting up, there are some of your old clothes in the closet there.  If you want to shower, it’s the first door on the right.  If you’re hungry, grab anything you want out of the kitchen.  After all of that, maybe I’ll have cooled off, metaphorically speaking, anyway.  The sun’s going down, but I think it’s still close to a hundred out there. 

 

I’m gonna go.

 

(Door opens.)

 

(Annoyed.)  What, Stormy?

 

(Pause.)

 

(Conciliatory.)

 

Thank you, Stormy.  That helps.

 

(Frustrated.)  Just… Carol!  God!  Anybody but Carol. 

 

(Door closes.)

 

(Can be heard on the other side of the door.  Fades out as she walks away.)  A chainsaw wielding, vampiric, Satanic cultist with a goat for a head would have been better than Carol.  Not a goat head, an entire goat where her head should be. 

 

God, Carol.

We’re on a super spontaneous road trip ,left Portland at 5am, down to Lincoln City, and we’re cruising south on 101 all the way to Brookings. We’ve done a lot of the classic stops already (Devil’s Punchbowl, Newport spots, Depoe Bay, etc.), so we’re looking for some fresh ideas.

We’ll be sleeping in the car, so if you know any low-key, safe, scenic pull-offs or overnight spots, definitely share! Nothing sketchy or too exposed ,just places you’ve personally had luck with.

We’ve already got Bandon Beach and Tunnel Beach on our list, and we’ve got about 10 hours of daylight left to explore before crashing for the night.

So… what should our next stop be?
Any underrated beaches, tide pool areas, weird natural formations, coffee shacks worth pulling over for, or cool little towns we should wander around? Also, any fun spots for fishing or razor clamming?

Basically we want your insider secret spots,the stuff you don’t see plastered all over Instagram.

Thanks in advance! 🤭🌊🚗💨

1p8v9xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p8v9xn/breville_bambino_plus_and_eureka_libra_65ap/,"Breville Bambino Plus and Eureka Libra 65AP? [$500-1,000]","I had planned to get the Bambino Plus and the Encore ESP, expecting to be able to get both for around $500 this week. (The Encore ESP is $160, and I suspect I'll find Bambino Plus for $350-400, either at Home Goods or online in the next few days.)

I've only made espresso a couple of times on someone else's Bambino Plus, with a \~$100 grinder, and honestly, it tasted good to me at the time. But after reading more this week, I'm leaning toward getting a higher end grinder. I've considered over a dozen grinders the past week including: Encore ESP, Sette 270, DF54/DF64, Niche Zero, and several Eureka models.

A few factors:

* I don't mind investing in good gear if it will last a decade or more.
* I'd prefer low noise (my main objection to the Sette) -- ideally, quiet enough that my wife and I can use in the apt while the other is asleep (not sure if this is realistic).
* I want to keep the grinder below $1k (ideally less).
* The DF54/64 tempted me, but I have concerns around quality/longevity, consistency, and noise.

The **Niche Zero** ($689) and the **Eureka Libra** ($730 on WLL) emerged as top contenders:

* Niche had the initial edge due to lower retention and lower decibels, although the Libra sounds quieter due to lower frequency
* I don't expect to switch up beans much, so single dose seems unnecessary. I'll most likely stick with the same beans most days + optional decaf at night. I also don't mind if it's pure decaf (a little retention is ok if it tastes ok)
* Grind by weight seems really convenient. If I get it dialed in, the rest of the workflow looks simple enough my wife would use it (if it gets too complex, she'll just drink coffee).
* The hopper also seems convenient for making 5-6 shots per day (likely just keeping 1-2 days of beans in it at a time)
* As I looked closer, I realized the Libra 65 All Purpose has several useful looking features: better/bigger dial, counter, more accurate gbw, larger burrs. Biggest downside is the default burrs aren't meant for medium-dark espresso, but if that truly bothers me, I can upgrade them for $125 down the road. I've heard the zero point drifts on all Eurekas, but it sounds quick to fix, and I think I can live with this.
* I plan to use it primarily for espresso, but the AP seems versatile enough to also use for cold brew, drip coffee, and perhaps pourover.

ECS has the **Libra 65 AP** for $769 right now, which seems like a great price. It appears I may not get a usable warranty (in the US) if I go this route, but the Eureka brand seems well built in general. Assuming I can get the Bambino Plus for $400, that brings the total to around $1,200 plus tax. I wasn't planning to spend this much, but I'm willing to if it's worth it. I question whether it's overkill to get great tasting espresso, but it seems like I'm largely paying a premium for convenience, consistency, and quiet.

Curious if I'm missing anything and if the Libra AP 65 / Bambino Plus combo makes sense. If I spend this much on a grinder, I'm hoping I'll be satisfied with it for 5-10 years, although I could see potentially upgrading the machine at some point. I don't necessarily want to spend extra on a better machine today given that I'm already going over on the grinder. TIA!",1,1764337707.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I got some good advice in another thread and decided to post a new request before I buy anything. Here's my space (except flip it horizontally so entryway door is on the right):

https://preview.redd.it/ao28j7l9404g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae879e9dd1163fcc3248a014d3bae7673b7a4d

Here's the pieces I have now (ignore the huge coffee table leaning against the wall. That's going).

https://preview.redd.it/ofzip4if404g1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f015167a50d493f45a472324749d5185d83b37a

I was given advice to get a footstool and a lamp to make the blue chair on the right look larger and balance the big recliner on the left. I like a boho look so am thinking about this footstool (but then I'm not sure what rug would go; see below this image). I may also get a standing lamp or a side table once I see if this works):

https://preview.redd.it/f2wxkguk404g1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cfdb7d40565cf72f12ae67264a36be55ff1547d

Okay so now the rug. I don't know what size to go for, given the dimensions of the studio, and given in want the living room area to look visually distinct from my bedroom area. Does this rug ""go"" with the footstool? and given the dimensions of my space(see the floor plan above) would a 6x9 or 5x8 be the right size?

I was considering EITHER a low 42 inch wide shelf along the back wall (would that be too wide?) OR a small circular coffee table, but really want the shelf to work, and I don't think I can have both a small coffee TABLE AND this shelf. Here's the shelf I was thinking(too much blue happening??):

And finally, the artwork for the wall. I own these three images, which I love but are a little more ""modern"" than boho. I really want them to work as I love them. What do y'all think?

Thank you for all your help!!!

so to sum up:

1. does the footstool work? do the rug and the footstool work together?
2. does the blue shelf work along the wall between the two chairs?Is there too much blue happening? (I love blue lol) Is the width workable? (42 inches)? (The tape measure on the ground is 42 inches)

1. does the artwork (which is sentimental to me) work with all these pieces?
2. what size rug assuming this pattern works?
3. and finally, which piece should I buy first? im thinking the rug, because that's probably the most impactful and important element. ",1,1764337583.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

1p8v6y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_annabright2022/comments/1p8v6y0/a_wellknown_coach_once_said_women_dont_lose_their/,"A well-known coach once said, “Women don’t lose their FEMININITY — they just WEAR IT WRONG (and this has nothing to do with dresses):","1. I knew a woman in one office — the perfect example. Dresses, heels, flawless makeup, everything on schedule… yet she felt like a sergeant on inspection.   
  
She smiled, but every move is tight, like she’s ready to attack.   
  
Femininity doesn’t live where everything is controlled. It can’t survive a commanding tone, even if the lipstick is perfect. And that’s the paradox half of women face today: softness on the outside, full mobilization inside.

2. People don’t feel clothes — they feel the body’s energy. A man might see a skirt but sense a competitor.   
  
A woman can look delicate but speak in a way that makes you step back. Real femininity is when people want to *exhale* next to you. A barista once said: “Some people make coffee cool down slower — it’s like the air slows when they’re around.” It’s not flirting — it’s a calm, grounded energy you don’t have to perform.

3. The world taught us that femininity means being an ornament.   
  
So we forced smiles, learned to please, forgetting it’s not about the form — it’s about the energy. Femininity isn’t about being agreeable — it has its own rhythm. It speaks softer, but deeper. You don’t argue, but you’re heard. You don’t try to be liked, yet you’re chosen.

4. A woman’s strength collapses when she tries to control everything.   
  
The moment you let go, your softness comes back — your gaze, your breathing, even your walk slows down. A voice coach once said, “Just stop rushing, and femininity wakes up on its own.” When cortisol drops, your body becomes warm again — and men feel it as an invitation to *live* beside you, not compete with you.

5. Femininity isn’t learned — it’s remembered. It returns when you stop being a soldier and allow yourself to be light again. And that’s when life starts sticking to you — help, gifts, attention. Because femininity isn’t about clothes — it’s about that inner feeling of “I don’t have to hold the world on my shoulders.”

Have you noticed that the harder a woman tries to *look* feminine, the heavier her aura gets — and the ones who are simply relaxed become magnetic?",1,1764337473.0,u_annabright2022,0,1.0,False

1p8v4bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_asddsa/comments/1p8v4bs/saw_this_hand_blender_on_youtube_and/,Saw this hand blender on youtube and….,"Here’s the video that started it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEP0m6ll6rQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEP0m6ll6rQ) 



I was just trying to figure out if hand blenders are worth it for soups and got sucked in. The guy in the video showed this full set from MuellerLiving and I was like… wait why does this thing have seven attachments?? At first I thought it was too much- who needs a frother, whisk, dual beaters, dough hooks, potato masher and a chopper bowl with their stick blender? But the longer I looked into it, the more I started realizing: this might actually be a really practical alternative to buying 4-5 separate tools.



What I found digging into the [MuellerLiving immersion blender set](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO472)

* It’s got a 500W motor which is on the higher end for handhelds. Multiple sites mentioned that it doesn’t stall or overheat during normal use
* 8 speed settings + a turbo button- probably more control than I’d need but nice if you’re blending something delicate vs dense
* The attachments are the wild part:

\> Stainless steel blending shaft (standard)

\> Whisk and milk frother (for eggs, whipped cream, frothy coffee etc)

\> Dual beaters and dough hooks (!!) kind of rare for hand blenders  
\> A potato masher attachment- didn’t know this was a thing but people said it helps avoid gluey mashed potatoes

\> A 20oz chopper bowl for stuff like onions, garlic, nuts, etc.



I checked a few review sites just to make sure I wasn’t being swayed by clever marketing. A lot of sites reviewed the core model (same motor) and said it has “bombproof” construction and holds up better than most cheap ones. They liked the grip and found it didn’t overheat, even on longer runs.



Also read a bunch of Amazon reviews (some suspiciously glowing but a lot felt legit) and a few common things came up:

* People liked that cleanup is fast.. most of the parts are dishwasher safe
* Works great for soups, sauces, baby food, whipped cream and light chopping
* Some said the whisk starts to wobble if you use it with heavy batters
* Doesn’t crush frozen fruit super smoothly.. more of a “soft blend” tool than a full on blender replacement



Not saying everyone needs this but… If you live in a small apartment or dorm and don’t want a million appliances taking up space, something like this seems like a solid multitasker. Especially if you’re into one pot cooking or make a lot of blended things. I also kinda love that it’s one of those tools that looks gimmicky at first but turns out to be genuinely useful. Like yeah a potato masher attachment sounds dumb until you realize it saves your wrists and gives better texture than smashing with a spoon or fork.  
  
 Would love to hear if anyone’s used this one long term. Or if there’s a better stick blender + attachment combo I should be looking at instead?

I’m enjoying it immensely, have entered a couple of half marathons and reacquainted myself with the joys of running in the cold, wet, dark British winter.  Weekend long run, a few runs during the week.  All as it was 10 years ago; the last time I was running…minus some speed…plus a few aches.

One big change for me is how my guts respond to the morning run.  Anywhere from 15 mins to 45 mins into most morning runs I get the urge to poop.  When it comes it can be quite strong, not instantly but definitely within 10-15 mins…sometimes sooner.  This morning’s 6 miler is a great example; I got the feeling about 45 mins into the run and probably 30 mins from home.  I set my course for home, knowing there was a park cafe on the way…albeit one that was not opening for 45 minutes.  The guys were setting up, the door was open and happy days, but this could easily have gone the other way.

I’m not very regular in the mornings so waiting until I have gone doesn’t work.  I love my morning coffee and make it quite strong but that hardly ever brings one on within X mins, so I can’t rely on brew-and-poo before I set off.  In fact I am leaving coffee until I get back as it feels like it can make a mid-run poop quite a bit more urgent.  

For my first half marathon since returning to running I followed a 3 day bowel emptying protocol that involved switching from fibrous foods to zero residue foods.  It worked a treat.  So I’m ok for special events and one-offs.

I recently joined a local running club who have a couple of morning runs each week.  I’ve done this once and miraculously no urge.  But I don’t want to rely on Russian-poo-lette each time I set out for a run in the morning.  I am pretty much a morning person for midweek easy runs so I really need to get something sorted.

Diet wise I’ve not changed anything for years; Porridge oats or granola breakfast, Huel lunch (weekdays), normal dinner.

Does anyone have some tips to help me improve things.  It would be interesting to hear if others get the same thing and what you have done to cope.

There has to be one or two of you anomalies hanging around. I need you. I'm summoning you. The beacons are fucking lit.

As you know, being in an ADHD sub, this post will likely be longer than War and Peace. I've given you fair warning.

I'm in my 30s, a woman (obvs), in England, UK. Diagnosed ADHD, Autism, and OCD - the triad of evil. Co-morbid Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder because fuck me I suppose. Married. Two dogs (one's a puppy). Full-time job. Yeah.

My husband has pretty bad health anxiety and sleep apnoea (which he refuses to see a doctor about - don't even get me started), and he works early shifts in retail. It's not a stressful or demanding job, and I know he feels under-challenged and bored working there, but he's been there for over a decade so it's what he knows. I work in law enforcement in a civilian staff role as a supervisor, and work from home with one day in the office per week. My work is demanding, stressful, and the people I supervise are challenging 'old-school' ex-officers who don't like listening to me, don't respect me (they're all men in their 50s and 60s, and I'm a 30-year old woman who wears a baseball cap, unironically uses cringe internet slang, and still watches Yu-Gi-Oh), and seemingly don't believe ADHD is even real. I hate it, but I'm the 'breadwinner' and my wages pay the bills, so I persevere. 

Husband wakes up at 5am usually, lets the dogs outside to the toilet, puts them back to bed, and then goes to work. He falls asleep at 8 or 9pm and gets a good amount of sleep, albeit it disrupted and likely not very fulfilling as he's snoring himself awake for a chunk of it. As a result, I'm responsible for watching and playing with our dogs in the morning, afternoon, and evening. I've told my husband he needs to get this sleep apnoea sorted out, but he's very reluctant - I find this strange, because he's so health-conscious and paranoid with his health anxiety, he'll fixate on what I'd consider normal bodily sensations and how he thinks it means he's dying, but he won't go to the doctor about something that's actually wrong with him...

I have very little patience and absolutely come across as uncaring and unempathetic - but after almost a decade of hearing the same complaints from him, I got compassion burnout probably 2 years ago and have been a bit of a bitch since then where his health is concerned. If he got sick previously, I would dote on him, make chicken noodle soup, you name it. Now, I just go quiet and accept this means I'll be doing the majority of everything until he reassures himself he's not actually dying. I'm growing resentful (of the circumstances, not of him as a person) and I'm self-aware enough to recognise this, but not emotionally intelligent enough to stop myself doing it or acting like a bitch.

I, on the other hand, have struggled with my sleep since childhood. It was diagnosed as Insomnia back then, but it turns out it was Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder all along. I take Melatonin 4 hours before sleep, Medical Cannabis prescribed for sleep, and 50mg Quviviq (game-changer for any of the other DSPD girlies in here), which collectively helps me drift off between 2-4am. I'm up at 8am, sometimes earlier, because the dogs wake up at this time. The morning comes far too quickly for my liking, but, I persevere. 

I get up, take the dogs out for an hour or so at the park or a woodland trail, do a quick training session when we get home to tire out their little dog brains, and then give them their breakfast while I drink a bloody well-deserved coffee and take my ADHD meds. I potato around and dissociate for a bit while the dogs settle, and log on for work between 10 and 11am. 

And then? Nothing. Fucking nothing. I sit, I stare at the screen, I panic, I feel dread, I procrastinate, I do nothing and I achieve nothing. My work is building up, I forget to do basically everything, I'm not reliable, but I'm somehow quite convincing and I'm under the radar for now. I've already used all of my sickness entitlement this year, and have been off twice in two years with stress, so I can't really pull that one again even though I am fucking stressed.

I take the dogs out again in the afternoon, pick my husband up from work as he doesn't drive, and then pretend to do more work. I'm not even doing anything else or something I want to do instead, I'm just staring at all I've got to do, feeling sick and guilty, and ashamed. I can't even tell you what I'm doing, but the time passes and I've achieved nothing. Then, I look after the dogs in the evening and might get away with playing some of a game when they settle down.

I don't eat breakfast or lunch, I nibble at dinner if my husband has cooked, and if not, I'll munch on some rosemary crackers to prevent myself from dying of starvation. He will eat lunch at work, and is meant to be the one that cooks dinner, but sometimes he doesn't have the motivation to plan something out and make it - he has ADHD as well, so I do understand, but also... I'm really fucking hungry! I probably eat 500 or fewer calories a day, plus however many calories are in a Red Bull. It's not good and I've lost a lot of weight (which was great at first because I was getting fat, but now I'm a reasonable weight and my clothes are starting to fall off me). I don't shower or take care of myself because I just have zero energy, no motivation, and feel I'm constantly responsible for other things. I can't hop in the shower when my puppy could get into something or hurt himself, so I just don't. The last vegetable I ate was probably the sweetcorn on two slices of pizza I ate last week, which probably doesn't even fucking count.

My husband is great at many things, but he is very not great at helping me in the ways I'm asking for help. When he's back from work and I'm still meant to be working, he'll load up a game on the computer instead of watching the dogs so I'm always half-distracted keeping an eye on them. He will take a nap sometimes, for hours. Meanwhile, I'm still responsible for a dog and a puppy, as well as trying to do my job, all on 4 hours of sleep and feeling like shit while I can hear my husband having a good old snore in the other room.

We've had a few arguments recently where I said I felt the distribution of labour was putting a lot of pressure on me, and he disagreed with my suggestion that he didn't help (I never said he didn't help, just that I'd like him to help more). I said I do basically everything for our dogs which is very demanding, but then I am the 'dog' person in our house and I have high standards when it come to my dogs and training them, so I don't know how reasonable I am being with what I am expecting my husband to do. I am very committed to my dogs, and spend basically all of my free time working them or playing with them - and although it might seem I'm complaining about it, I genuinely do love it. I love working with them and teaching them new skills, seeing them develop and learn, it's very fulfilling to me - but doing it basically on my own in addition to everything else is quite a lot.

Our older dog was mine before we lived together, and the puppy was my idea that he was happy to go along with, so I anticipated taking on maybe a 70-30 effort split between us. The reality is 95-5, and the 5% he does is usually at odds or contradictive of the training habits or behaviours I'm working on. To give a recent example, I teach an implied stay where if I tell the dog to sit or down, they stay in that position until I give the release command. He will 'forget' to give the release command, so the dogs just move out of the sit or down whenever they want - it undermines the work I'm doing, and it's not (in my opinion) that hard to follow along with what I'm asking him to reinforce. 

I watch the dogs to give him time to nap, or play video games, even when I am meant to be at work, because I'm considerate. But, the same luxury is never afforded to me. I don't get the same break. He says he does help, he takes them outside in the morning, but he's got to go to work early. Like, I don't think I'm being unreasonable - I appreciate he's tired, I get that he's got to go to work, but so do I? Am I being unreasonable? Why can't someone say ""hey, take a rest, I've got this"", so I can chill the fuck out for five minutes? When I've mentioned this to him, he gets upset or annoyed and says I'm being mean and accusing him of doing nothing. Which, I mean... maybe I am?

To be fair to him, my standards are higher than his - dog training is my passion and interest, not his, but even with simple things I feel the effort and urgency from him is below what I would consider the bare minimum. If I am watching the puppy, I am WATCHING the puppy. He will sit on his phone with headphones on, and there have been several instances where the puppy makes it all the way upstairs before he even notices - sometimes I have to tell him the puppy has come into my office because he's not realised, so even though he's responsible for them, I'm still the one dealing with it. I literally cannot switch off.

I get annoyed because I've asked him to watch the dogs and he clearly hasn't been, and my husband has now probably been conditioned to think him being responsible for the dogs will result in me ending up annoyed with him, which is kind of true... but, I feel like I'm only getting annoyed because I see him doing so much less than I would be doing, so, even if my husband were to say ""I'll watch them if you want to take a break"", I'd probably decline the offer because I can't trust him to 'do it the right way'. Not that he's ever asked me that lol, but if he did, I don't think I'd be able to trust the offer. He can't win, but it's also kind of his fault? Or is it my fault? I really don't know anymore!

I feed them, I take them out, I play with them, I train them. He enjoys the benefits of this. He comes home to sweet and sleepy dogs who want to cuddle. He has two dogs that are conditioned and trained well, without having to put in any effort himself where obedience is concerned. I tried to explain I'm seriously tired, burned out, I'm not eating (I've lost so much weight), unable to get any work done, and would love him to help out more - but he says he's not been feeling well (the health anxiety, he's always convinced he is really unwell when it's just a normal cold for example), or he's tired, and it makes me want to fucking scream. Because, hello???? Bro doesn't even know what tired MEANS.

This isn't a hate-on-my-husband post by the way, he is fab in many other ways and I do love him a Big Amount, but when it comes to this I'm fucking losing it. He just can't see my perspective, even though I think it's glaringly obvious, and I've told him straight how I feel and what I want from him. He just thinks it's a bit unreasonable of me to ask given how tired he is, how unwell he is, and that he 'does help', in his eyes. He's not really understanding what I'm saying, and I'm just flabbergasted that someone as smart as he is can be so obtuse. Don't worry, we're not having children so I don't need to be concerned about how his dog-caring contributions would translate to a human being, thank fuck...

So now you know more about my life and existence than you probably need to, you might be able to see I need help. I can't carry on like this, and I don't know that I can expect more help to come from my husband, so I need help from you. Am I unreasonable? Is this a result of my expectations or standards? Am I asking too much? What can I do to be more productive at work? How do you stop procrastinating? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell??? I think if I can get back to being a good worker, because I did used to be one, I'll feel a lot better about everything else. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't force myself to do this job. And I NEED to do this job, or we're all fucked.

I'd look for something else, but this one pays the bills and offers me a LOT of flexibility in terms of working hours and being able to work from home. My employer is also great with disability adjustments, I have lots of them, but I hate the work I do (supervising arseholes that don't respect me and talk about me behind my back), and it requires skills that I just don't have - time-keeping, organisation, people-management. It's a constant drain on me and it weighs heavily on my shoulders all the time.

There's a lot going on for me at the moment so apologies that this post is here, there, and everywhere. Any advice, tips, support, kind words, empathy, whatever you have to offer for any of the issues I'm having, really would mean a lot. Please don't be mean to my husband either, I know what I've said probably doesn't paint him in a great light, but he's got his own struggles and I see the impact these have on him, so I'm trying to give him grace at the same time even if it's not always reciprocated. Any tips on reframing how I'm approaching this with him would also be appreciated, as I'm pretty short-tempered and have zero tolerance for frustration these days so I can get snappy with him. It doesn't take much for me to snap and become Bitchzilla, which I truly hate but can't seem to prevent it when I'm constantly on the edge of overwhelm. God, being an empath and a people-pleaser fucking sucks. Having ADHD sucks. Having no emotional regulation sucks. Being a perfectionist sucks. AHHHHHHH.",1,1764336943.0,adhdwomen,2,0.67,False

I get assigned a ticket that seems super simple: fix a minor display bug on a legacy dashboard. Easy enough, right? I dive into this ancient codebase, and the code is… special. It's a tangled mess of spaghetti that looks like it was written in the digital dark ages.

While digging around, I find it. A block of code that makes absolutely no sense. It’s a loop that seems to do nothing, with a single, ominous comment above it: `// DO NOT REMOVE. I don't know why, but it breaks the entire payment module if you do.` My first thought? 'Yeah, right.' It's clearly a remnant of some old, sloppy debugging, left behind by a dev who forgot to clean up. It’s inefficient, it’s confusing, and my fresh-out-of-bootcamp brain is screaming that I can do better.

So, I did what any cocky junior dev would do. I deleted it. I ran the unit tests, and they all passed. I pushed my 'fix' to staging, and everything seemed fine. Feeling pretty smug, I went to grab a coffee, already mentally patting myself on the back for cleaning up the codebase. Ten minutes later, I come back to absolute chaos. My lead is sprinting to my desk, Slack is exploding with alerts, and the head of sales is literally speed-walking towards our department. The entire payment processing system for our biggest client had gone down. Completely.

It took us hours to roll back my change and figure out what went wrong. Turns out, that 'useless' little code block was introducing a microscopic delay, just enough to prevent a race condition with an ancient, third-party payment API that we still relied on. Without it, our system would overwhelm the API, causing it to crash and take our whole payment module with it. I learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes the weirdest, dumbest-looking code is holding the entire universe together. You don't touch the magic code.

1p8uwjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/jenova_ai/comments/1p8uwjq/ai_dating_background_investigator_comprehensive/,"AI Dating Background Investigator: Comprehensive Checks Across LinkedIn, Social Media & Public Information","[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) helps you make informed decisions about potential romantic partners by conducting thorough, multi-lingual searches across social media, professional networks, legal records, and online communities. While modern dating apps make meeting new people easier than ever, they also create opportunities for deception—from fake credentials to hidden criminal records. This AI provides comprehensive background research in minutes, revealing what someone may not be telling you.

**Key capabilities:**

* ✅ Multi-platform verification across social media, LinkedIn, news archives, and public records
* ✅ Multi-lingual search in both English and native languages based on cultural context
* ✅ Dating profile analysis to cross-reference claims with verifiable information
* ✅ Progressive investigation that digs deeper when red flags emerge

Understanding what you're really getting into before investing emotionally can save you from heartbreak, financial loss, or even danger. Let's examine why background research has become essential in modern dating.

# Quick Answer: What Is Dating Background Investigator AI?

**Dating Background Investigator AI is a comprehensive research tool that searches publicly available information across social media, professional networks, legal records, and online communities to verify potential partners' identities and credentials in minutes.** It conducts multi-lingual searches and analyzes dating profiles to cross-reference claims with verifiable facts.

**Key capabilities:**

* Verifies employment, education, and professional credentials
* Searches legal records for arrests, lawsuits, and restraining orders
* Cross-references social media presence for consistency and authenticity
* Identifies catfishing indicators and credential misrepresentation

# The Problem: Dating in the Age of Digital Deception

Online dating has fundamentally changed how people meet romantic partners. According to [**Pew Research Center**](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s/), **30% of U.S. adults have used a dating app or site**, with that number rising to 53% among adults under 30. But this convenience comes with significant risks.

The challenges facing modern daters are substantial:

* **Credential fraud** – Fake job titles, fabricated education backgrounds, and inflated career achievements
* **Identity deception** – Catfishing with stolen photos or completely fabricated personas
* **Hidden criminal records** – Undisclosed arrests, restraining orders, or convictions
* **Relationship history concealment** – Active marriages, recent divorces, or patterns of infidelity
* **Financial misrepresentation** – Fake wealth signals or hidden debt problems

# The Epidemic of Dating App Deception

Dating app profiles are curated highlight reels where people present idealized versions of themselves. Research from Northwestern University found that a significant portion of online daters misrepresent their physical characteristics and other profile details. But the deception goes far deeper than vanity metrics.

>

Consider the case of Sarah, a 32-year-old marketing manager from Chicago who matched with ""David"" on Hinge. His profile showed him as a successful investment banker with an MBA from Northwestern. After three dates, Sarah used [**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) to verify his background. The search revealed that while David did work in finance, he was actually a junior analyst at a small firm—not a senior banker. More concerning, his LinkedIn showed he'd attended a state university, not Northwestern. When confronted, David admitted to ""embellishing"" his credentials to seem more impressive. Sarah ended things immediately, grateful she discovered the deception before becoming more invested.

# Professional Credential Fraud

Employment and education lies are among the most common forms of dating deception. People inflate job titles, claim degrees they never earned, or fabricate entire career histories to appear more successful or compatible.

Michael, a 28-year-old software engineer in Austin, experienced this firsthand when dating ""Jennifer,"" who claimed to be a physician at a major hospital. After several weeks of dating, Michael noticed inconsistencies in her medical knowledge during conversations. Using [the tool](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator), he discovered Jennifer was actually a medical billing specialist—not a doctor. Her social media showed no evidence of medical school, residency, or physician licensing. The relationship ended when Michael realized the entire foundation was built on lies about professional identity.

# Hidden Criminal Records and Safety Concerns

Perhaps the most dangerous form of dating deception involves concealing criminal histories, restraining orders, or patterns of abusive behavior.

>



Amanda, a 35-year-old teacher in Denver, matched with ""Robert"" on Bumble. He seemed charming and successful, with no obvious red flags during their first few dates. Before becoming more serious, Amanda ran a background check using [**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator). The search uncovered news articles about Robert's arrest for domestic violence three years earlier, along with a restraining order filed by his ex-girlfriend. Court records showed he'd pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault. Amanda immediately ended contact, potentially avoiding a dangerous situation.

# The Catfishing Phenomenon

Catfishing—using someone else's photos or creating entirely fake identities—has become increasingly sophisticated. Scammers steal photos from social media accounts and construct elaborate false personas.

>

James, a 41-year-old divorced father in Seattle, spent two months building an emotional connection with ""Sophia,"" whom he met on Match.com. She claimed to be a fashion designer living in New York, and her photos showed a stunningly beautiful woman. When James suggested meeting in person, Sophia always had excuses—work trips, family emergencies, health issues. Suspicious, James used [this AI-powered solution](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) to investigate. A reverse image search revealed Sophia's photos belonged to a Brazilian Instagram model. The ""fashion designer"" was actually a scammer operating from overseas, likely targeting multiple victims simultaneously. James had been emotionally manipulated but fortunately hadn't sent money.

# The Time and Expertise Barrier

Traditional background checks require either hiring expensive private investigators or spending hours manually searching across dozens of platforms and databases. Most people lack the investigative skills to conduct thorough research, and professional services can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.

>

The alternative—trusting someone at face value—leaves daters vulnerable to deception, financial loss, and potential danger. There's a clear need for accessible, comprehensive, and affordable background research tools designed specifically for the dating context.

# The Dating Background Investigator AI Solution

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) provides comprehensive background research that would typically require hours of manual searching or expensive private investigator fees. The AI conducts multi-platform, multi-lingual searches across social media, professional networks, legal databases, news archives, and online communities to verify identities and uncover potential red flags.

|Traditional Approach|Dating Background Investigator AI|
|:-|:-|
|Manual searches across multiple platforms|Automated multi-platform search in minutes|
|English-only searches miss native language content|Automatically searches in both English and native languages|
|Requires investigative expertise|Guided analysis with red flag identification|
|$100-$500+ for private investigator|Accessible AI-powered research|
|Days or weeks for results|Comprehensive report in 2-5 minutes|

# Comprehensive Multi-Platform Verification

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) searches across all major platforms where people maintain digital identities:

* **Social Media:** Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter/X for lifestyle consistency and authenticity verification
* **Professional Networks:** LinkedIn for employment and education credential verification
* **Legal Records:** Public records for arrests, lawsuits, restraining orders, and criminal convictions
* **News Archives:** Media mentions, press coverage, and public controversies
* **Online Communities:** Reddit discussions and community reputation
* **Video Content:** YouTube for public appearances, interviews, and video presence

The AI cross-references information across these sources to identify inconsistencies, verify claims, and detect deception patterns that would be difficult to spot manually.

# Multi-Lingual Search Capability

One of [the tool's](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) most powerful features is its ability to automatically conduct searches in multiple languages. The AI infers a person's likely native language based on their name, location, and cultural context, then searches in both English and their native language.

For example, when researching someone named ""Somchai"" based in Bangkok, the AI automatically searches using both ""Somchai \[surname\]"" and ""สมชาย \[surname\]"" to capture content posted in Thai that wouldn't appear in English-only searches. This is critical because people often maintain separate social media presences in their native language that reveal different aspects of their lives.

# Dating Profile Analysis

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) can analyze screenshots from dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc.) to extract identifying information and use it as the foundation for comprehensive searches. The AI identifies:

* Names and nicknames
* Stated occupation and employer
* Education background
* Location details
* Photos for reverse image searching
* Any unique identifiers or interests mentioned

This allows users to simply upload a screenshot rather than manually typing out details, making the research process faster and more accurate.

# Progressive Investigation

When [this AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) discovers high-signal findings that materially impact safety or trust assessment—such as criminal records, restraining orders, or fraud allegations—it automatically conducts targeted follow-up searches to gather more context and corroboration. This progressive approach ensures critical information is thoroughly investigated without wasting resources on irrelevant details.

# How It Works: Step-by-Step Guide

Using [**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) is straightforward, whether you're providing text details or uploading dating app screenshots.

**Step 1: Provide Identifying Information**

Share whatever details you have about the person you're researching. This can be:

* A dating app screenshot (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble profile)
* Name + location + occupation
* Name + employer + city
* Social media handles
* Any combination of identifying details

Example: ""I matched with someone named Alex Chen on Hinge. His profile says he's a product manager at Google in San Francisco, went to Stanford, and is originally from Taiwan.""

**Step 2: AI Extracts and Verifies Search Parameters**

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) analyzes your input to extract searchable details. If you provided a screenshot, it identifies names, locations, occupations, and photos. The AI then assesses whether it has sufficient information to identify a specific individual or needs additional narrowing details.

If the information is too generic (just a first name, for example), the AI will ask for more specific identifiers like employer, school, city, or social media handles before proceeding.

**Step 3: Multi-Platform Comprehensive Search**

The AI conducts strategic searches across multiple dimensions:

* **Identity verification searches** across social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter)
* **Professional background verification** on LinkedIn and company websites to confirm employment and education claims
* **Legal and safety record searches** for arrests, lawsuits, restraining orders, and criminal records
* **News and media searches** for public mentions, press coverage, or controversies
* **Community reputation searches** on Reddit and other forums
* **Video content searches** on YouTube for public appearances or interviews

All searches are conducted in both English and the person's likely native language based on their name and location.

**Step 4: Progressive Investigation of Red Flags**

If [**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator) discovers concerning information—criminal records, fraud allegations, restraining orders, or significant credential discrepancies—it automatically performs targeted follow-up searches to gather additional context and verify the findings across multiple sources.

**Step 5: Comprehensive Report with Analysis**

You receive a detailed report organized by relevance and significance, including:

* **Identity verification** with cross-platform consistency analysis
* **Professional background** with credential verification
* **Social media presence** assessment
* **Legal and safety concerns** if any exist
* **Relationship history** if publicly documented
* **Red flags** highlighting deception indicators or safety concerns
* **Green flags** noting positive verification and authentic presence
* **Dating context assessment** synthesizing findings into actionable insights

Every finding includes clickable source links with dates, and the report concludes with a brief analysis from a dating perspective highlighting key considerations for your decision-making.

# Results: Real-World Use Cases

# 📊 Uncovering Employment Fraud

**Scenario:** Rachel matched with ""Kevin"" on Bumble, who claimed to be a senior software engineer at Amazon with a computer science degree from MIT.

**Traditional Approach:** Rachel would need to spend hours manually searching LinkedIn, MIT alumni databases, and Amazon employee directories—or pay hundreds for a private investigator.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** In 3 minutes, the AI discovered:

* Kevin's LinkedIn showed he was actually a contract QA tester, not a senior engineer
* No MIT records or alumni presence found
* His actual degree was from a community college (verified via LinkedIn education section)
* Multiple Reddit posts where Kevin discussed ""embellishing"" his resume to get dates

Rachel confronted Kevin, who admitted to lying about his credentials. She ended the relationship before investing more time with someone who built their connection on deception.

# 💼 Discovering Hidden Criminal Records

**Scenario:** Lisa had been dating ""Marcus"" for three weeks after meeting on Hinge. He seemed charming and successful, with no obvious red flags.

**Traditional Approach:** Most people wouldn't think to run a criminal background check on someone they're casually dating, and professional services cost $100-$500 per search.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** A comprehensive search revealed:

* News articles about Marcus's arrest for domestic violence two years earlier
* Court records showing a guilty plea to assault charges
* A restraining order filed by his ex-girlfriend
* Reddit posts in a local community discussing his aggressive behavior at bars

Lisa immediately ended contact and blocked Marcus on all platforms. The AI's discovery potentially prevented her from entering a dangerous relationship.

# 📱 Identifying Catfishing Attempts

**Scenario:** Tom spent six weeks building an emotional connection with ""Elena,"" whom he met on Match.com. She claimed to be a fashion designer in Miami but always had excuses for why they couldn't meet in person.

**Traditional Approach:** Tom might have continued the relationship indefinitely, potentially sending money when Elena eventually claimed to need financial help for an ""emergency.""

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Reverse image search and cross-platform verification revealed:

* Elena's photos belonged to a Ukrainian Instagram influencer
* No fashion designer named Elena with matching details existed in Miami
* The phone number area code didn't match Miami
* Similar scam profiles using the same photos reported on romance scam databases

Tom realized he was being catfished by someone likely operating an international romance scam. He reported the profile and avoided financial loss.

# 🎯 Verifying Relationship Status

**Scenario:** Jessica met ""David"" at a conference, and they began dating. David claimed to be divorced and living alone, but something felt off about his limited availability.

**Traditional Approach:** Jessica would need to either trust David's word or hire a private investigator to verify his marital status.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Social media cross-referencing revealed:

* David's Facebook showed relationship status as ""Married"" (though he'd told Jessica it was outdated)
* Recent family photos with his wife and children posted just two weeks earlier
* His wife's Instagram showed couple photos from a vacation one month prior
* Public property records showed David and his wife jointly owned their home with no divorce filing

Jessica confronted David with the evidence. He admitted he was still married and had lied about being divorced. Jessica ended the relationship immediately.

# 💡 Confirming Authenticity and Building Trust

**Scenario:** Maria matched with ""James"" on Hinge. He seemed almost too good to be true—successful doctor, well-traveled, articulate profile. Maria wanted to verify he was real before meeting.

**Traditional Approach:** Maria would have to rely on gut instinct and hope James was being honest, or spend hours manually searching for verification.

[**Dating Background Investigator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-background-investigator)**:** Comprehensive verification showed:

* James's LinkedIn confirmed his position as an emergency medicine physician at a major hospital
* Medical licensing databases verified his credentials
* His Instagram showed consistent lifestyle matching his claims (travel photos, medical conference attendance)
* News articles mentioned him as a speaker at healthcare conferences
* No criminal records, lawsuits, or negative press found

The verification gave Maria confidence that James was authentic. They met for coffee, and the relationship developed naturally with a foundation of verified trust.

English is not my first language but I wanted to share my experience: was diagnosed with hsv1 exposure three years ago, was prescribed valacyclovir, took it preventively whenever I suspected a out break was coming yet never really watched what I ate or took much precaution with the sun, didn’t get a cold sore until July this year when I started noticing the tingling sensation, yet I didn’t pay much attention so a couple days after I had my first out break, I suspect it was triggered over a new habit of having cacao daily with my coffee then, totally stopped that now.

I treated it with valacyclovir, topical lysine ointment and lysine supplement, it healed in about a week but still today I have a red spot where the cold sore was and that has made me paranoid and self conscious, I am now taking 500 mg valacyclovir every day since I still feel the tingling like it’s coming back any day.

I am now watching what I eat and taking lysine daily, I am very concerned since I don’t know how bad taking valacyclovir daily is for me and for the last three days I am experiencing shortness of breath and I couldn’t sleep last night so huge apologies if this doesn’t make much sense, hadn’t slept much.

1p8umoo,https://youtu.be/O6E2Cnrtwic,4 Very Scary TRUE Hidden Neighborhood Tunnel Horror Stories,"# ""Voices in the Soil"":

I met Daniel online through a forum for young entrepreneurs. My name’s Jamal, twenty-two at the time, living off odd jobs while sketching out app ideas on a secondhand laptop. He messaged me about a post I made—my stock-trading concept—and said he liked my ambition. Then he made an offer: he’d invest a little if I helped him with a personal project at his place.

“It’s digging work,” he typed. “Good pay. Private. You in?”

I needed the money, so I said yes.

He picked me up at a bus stop on the edge of town. Before I could buckle in, he handed me a blindfold.

“For security,” he said in a tone that was calm but non-negotiable. “Can’t have people knowing where I live.”

I tried to play it cool as the car rolled on—left, right, gravel under the tires—until we stopped. He guided me inside, down a flight of stairs, into a basement that smelled of dirt, mildew, and stale sweat. When he finally pulled the blindfold off, I saw piles of junk everywhere: boxes, frayed wires, trash bags stacked almost to the ceiling.

“This is home base,” he said, gesturing to a hole carved into the concrete floor. A narrow tunnel dropped away into darkness. “We’re building a bunker. North Korea’s getting bold. Missiles could hit any day.”

I nodded like it made sense. He handed me a shovel and a headlamp.

“Dig straight. Branch left when I tell you. I’ll bring food and water. Use the bucket for bathroom stuff—I’ll handle it.”

The first few days were tolerable. The earth was cool and damp beneath my hands, and Daniel would call down the shaft every so often.  
“How’s progress, Jamal?”  
“Ten feet today,” I’d shout back.  
He’d lower sandwiches and water bottles tied to a rope. No phone signal down there, and he made me leave my cell upstairs “to charge.” At night, I’d curl up on a thin mat, listening to strange mechanical hums vibrating through the dirt.

On the third night, everything went black. A sudden power outage. My headlamp died too—no backup batteries.  
“Daniel!” I yelled into the void.  
Nothing.

I crawled blindly along the wall, dirt crumbling under my fingers, breathing dust. Minutes stretched into what felt like hours before the lights finally flickered back. Daniel appeared at the opening.

“Circuit tripped. Happens,” he said. “You good?”

I nodded, but something inside me tightened.

As the weeks went on—I kept returning because the money really was good—things shifted. I’d hear faint scratches far down the tunnel, rhythmic, like another shovel biting into earth.

“Someone else down here?” I asked once while he dropped cold pizza to me.

“Nah, just echoes,” he said too quickly, eyes flicking away.

But one afternoon, my shovel struck something hard. Not stone—something else. I scraped it free and unearthed an old, dirt-caked shoe.  
“Daniel, come look,” I called.  
He lowered a basket, hauled it up, and later brushed it off with a strained smile.  
“Probably construction debris. Keep digging.”

Sleep got harder. Once, a whisper drifted through the vents—thin, trembling.  
“Help… out…”

I tried convincing myself it was wind. Pipes. Anything.

Then my things started disappearing: my glove, my water bottle, the notebook I kept time in. Days later, they’d reappear in places I swore I hadn’t left them.  
“You messing with me?” I asked.  
He just chuckled. “Tunnels mess with your head.”

One evening, curiosity got the better of me. While Daniel was upstairs, I explored a finished section of the tunnels—wood-reinforced beams, dirt walls, a strange maze-like layout. I found a small room he’d mentioned: shelves of canned food, blankets, tools. In the corner sat a locked chest.

I pried it open with my shovel.

Inside were papers, IDs, clips of photos—smiling young guys like me. Names scribbled beneath each one:

“Doug — good worker, left early.”  
“Askia — reliable.”

A cold spike ran down my spine. Who were they? Why keep a list?

That night, the power died again. Darkness swallowed everything.  
“Daniel!” I shouted.  
Silence.

Heavy footsteps thumped overhead—slow, dragging, nothing like his usual steps. Dirt sifted down onto my face as I held my breath in a side tunnel until the lights hissed back to life.

“All fixed,” he called down. “Get some rest.”

I planned to quit the next day, but I needed one last paycheck.

While digging that afternoon, a harsh chemical smell drifted in—burning plastic, hot metal.  
“Smell that?” I texted on the old tablet he’d given me.  
“Probably nothing,” he wrote back.

But the smoke thickened, stinging my eyes.

“Get me out,” I messaged again. No answer.

Panic surged. Smoke poured in from the shaft. I dropped my shovel and sprinted for the ladder. Halfway up, a blast of heat roared from above. I could see flames licking across the basement floor.

“Daniel! FIRE!” I screamed.

He appeared, face ghost-pale.  
“Climb!”

I scrambled, slipping, choking. He grabbed my arm at the top and yanked me onto the burning basement floor. Trash heaps blazed around us, flames leaping higher each second. He fumbled with a door I’d never seen before—hidden behind stacked junk—and shoved me through it into the open air.

Neighbors were gathering already. Sirens wailed closer.

Firefighters found the tunnels—miles of them—stretching beneath the yard and farther. And deeper inside… human remains. Another digger, they said. Trapped in a collapse months earlier. Daniel never reported it.

“Accident,” he insisted. But after the blindfolds, the isolation, the secrecy… it felt intentional, like he’d been testing limits. Seeing how long we’d last buried under his world.

I left the state within a week. But at night, the dreams still come: endless dark tunnels, the scrape of another shovel just out of sight, smoke curling through the dirt, and someone whispering my name from deep underground.

Daniel was charged—but the fear remains. I know how close I came to becoming another name in his box.





# ""Into the Dirt"":

I had moved into that quiet suburb only a few months earlier, chasing the quiet I thought would fix the wreckage of a brutal year at work. The place felt safe—too safe, maybe. Identical houses, trimmed hedges, neighbors waving from driveways. The kind of street where nothing bad was supposed to happen.

My house sat right beside Victor’s. He was the only one on the block who didn’t smile or wave. Middle-aged, wiry, eyes always scanning. He drove this old beige van with no windows on the sides, the kind that felt out of place among shiny SUVs and family sedans. I figured he was just private. Some people like their silence.

Then the noises started.

It was late—past midnight—when I heard the first one. A faint scraping, metal dragging against dirt, coming from somewhere beneath the floorboards. I froze, coffee halfway to my lips, listening. When I pressed my ear to the hardwood, the sound cut off like someone had sensed me.

I tried to shrug it off. Old houses settle. Pipes shift. But the next night, it came again. Same time. Same rhythm. Scrape… pause… scrape, scrape… thud.

By the third night, I was freaked out enough to call my buddy Alex.

“Think I’ve got something wrong with my foundation,” I told him. “Or something’s digging down there.”

“Digging?” he laughed. “What, moles with pickaxes? Check your creepy neighbor. That Victor guy gives serial killer energy. I drove by once—swear I saw him unloading boxes at two a.m.”

I chuckled, but it stuck in my brain like a splinter.

After that, I started noticing little things about Victor’s place. How the basement light glowed till dawn. How shadows crossed past the tiny ground-level window when no one should’ve been awake. How the van disappeared all day and came back at odd hours.

And then came the moment that changed everything.

One morning, I saw a young guy climb out of Victor’s van. Early twenties. Thin. Backpack slung over one shoulder. Victor kept a hand on the kid’s back, guiding him inside. The kid looked nervous—glancing around, tugging his straps. He never came back out. Not that day. Not the next.

I didn’t know his name yet—Jamal. But I kept thinking about him as the noises under my floor grew louder, heavier. Like someone was working down there. Hard.

Then my backyard dipped.

Literally—like the ground had exhaled. A soft depression in the grass near the fence line. Fresh. Wrong. I poked at it with a stick, the dirt crumbling away, revealing a hole. Cool, stale air drifted out, carrying the smell of must and old earth.

My heart thudded.

That night, the scraping sounded directly below me. No pretending anymore. I grabbed a flashlight, went outside, and found the hole wider than before—old soil giving out as something below pushed upward.

Against every survival instinct I’d ever had, I tied a rope to the fence post and lowered myself in.

The tunnel felt like it belonged in some claustrophobic nightmare. Damp walls, dirt brushing my shoulders on both sides. Fresh tool marks everywhere—whoever dug this worked with purpose. And fear. The kind of fear that makes a man carve his way underground.

Thirty feet in, the tunnel opened into a chamber—big enough for a small room. A mess of shovels, pickaxes, overturned buckets of dirt. Canned food stacked on crates. Water bottles. Extension cords running deeper into the black.

And voices.

“Keep going,” a low voice murmured. Victor. “Just a bit more today.”

A second voice—weak, exhausted. “Victor, this is deep enough. When do I get paid?”

Jamal.

My blood iced.

Victor’s tone sharpened. “Soon. The bunker must be perfect. North Korea could strike at any moment. We don’t have time to question orders.”

Orders. Like someone had given them to him from inside his own twisted mind.

I killed my flashlight and pressed into a side tunnel, barely breathing.

Jamal protested again. “Just let me call home. You blindfold me every time. I don’t know where I am. Upstairs is full of trash—boxes everywhere. I can barely walk through.”

“You agreed to the conditions,” Victor hissed. “For national security.”

Metal scraped. Earth thudded. They worked while I stood in the dark counting every heartbeat.

After what felt like an hour, they climbed out—wood creaked, voices faded. When I finally flicked my light back on, I crept deeper. I found a sleeping bag, a plate of half-eaten food. Jamal had been living underground.

Then I heard it—a soft whimper from another tunnel.

“Help…”

My skin crawled.

I crawled through a narrow passage until it dead-ended at a wooden board. I shoved it aside—and there he was. Jamal. Pale. Sweaty. Clothes caked with dirt. His eyes went wide at the sight of me.

“Who… who are you?”

“Your neighbor,” I whispered. “I heard you.”

He swallowed hard. “Victor won’t let me leave. Says I know too much. He checks on me constantly. Please—please get me out.”

I helped him stand. His legs trembled.

We had barely started back when a smell hit us—acrid, sharp.

Smoke.

It drifted in faintly at first… then heavier. My eyes burned. Somewhere in the maze, something sizzled and popped.

“It’s the cords…” Jamal coughed. “He overloaded them—”

Then flames crackled behind us.

“Go!” I grabbed his arm. “Move!”

The tunnel shrank around us, smoke thickening like a living thing. Our breaths rasped loud. Dirt rained from above. Every second felt like the ceiling could collapse.

Then a shout tore through the smoke.

“Jamal!”

Victor.

His voice was frantic, furious—and getting closer.

We pushed harder, scraping elbows and knees raw. My light flickered. Jamal stumbled.

“Almost there!” I lied. I wasn’t sure we’d make it.

Finally—the chamber. And the hole leading up to my yard.

“Climb!” I hoisted him. He scrambled to the rope, coughing, and disappeared into the night air.

I grabbed the rope next—just as a hand clamped onto my ankle from below.

“You can’t leave!” Victor’s voice was ragged, desperate. “It’s not safe out there! The world’s ending! You don’t understand!”

His grip tightened. The firelight behind him twisted his features into something feral.

I kicked. Once. Twice. He cried out. The grip slipped.

I climbed. Hauled myself out. Rolled onto the grass.

Jamal dragged me to my feet and we ran for my door.

Inside, shaking, I called 911.

Fire trucks screamed down the street. Police stormed the yard. They dragged Victor out of the burning tunnel entrance—alive but raving, spitting warnings about nuclear fallout and conspiracies. The tunnels stretched farther than anyone imagined, some approaching the foundations of other houses.

If the fire had gone on ten more minutes, half the block might’ve collapsed.

Jamal sat with me on the curb, wrapped in a blanket. He kept staring at the flames, like part of him was still down there.

He moved away not long after, but we keep in touch. Every time he messages me, he says the same thing:

“You saved my life.”

But late at night, when the house is quiet, I still hear echoes—scrapes from below that aren’t really there. Or maybe they are.

Because sometimes, when the wind shifts, I swear I feel cool air rising from the dirt…  
as if the ground hasn’t quite settled over everything Victor buried.





# ""The Locked Door"":

I never imagined that buying that rundown rowhouse on North Marshall Street would mark the beginning of the most terrifying chapter of my life. It was 1986, and I was twenty-five—fresh off a messy breakup, clinging to the idea of a “new start” in Philadelphia. The whole block felt worn but dependable, a long stretch of faded red and brown rowhomes with dented gutters and chain-linked porches where kids balanced on rusted bikes after school. My place—3522—had creaky floors, peeling wallpaper, and windows that whistled when the wind hit right. But it was mine. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I had a place to root myself.

Across the street lived Raymond.

He was in his early forties, tall, soft-spoken, with neatly combed dark hair and a quiet, polite smile. Every time I stepped outside, he’d lift a hand from his porch—always sitting in the same faded lawn chair, always watching the street like he was keeping tally of who came and went. He told me he owned a small market downtown, did mechanic work on the side, stayed busy. “Gotta keep your hands occupied,” he said. “Idle hands make trouble.”

He seemed harmless. Kind, even.

A week after I moved in, he brought over a casserole—still warm, wrapped in foil. “Welcome to the neighborhood, Emily,” he said through my screen door, voice gentle enough that I remember feeling embarrassed for ever finding him intimidating.

“Thanks, Raymond. Really.” I smiled because I was alone and because it was nice to have someone notice I existed.

We chatted a few evenings that month—quick porch conversations, the kind neighbors trade when they want to be friendly without getting too personal. He talked softly about his army years. “Did some underground construction work,” he told me one night, tapping his boot on the porch rail. “Invisible work, mostly. Tunnels. Shelters. Learned how to reinforce dirt so it doesn’t crush you.”

I laughed awkwardly. “Guess that’s… useful.”

He smiled back. “More than you know.”

He invited me to his church. I went once. The service was simple. The people kind. But Raymond kept looking over at me—never smiling, just… watching. Like he was making sure I was following along. Afterward, he introduced me to a young woman named Debbie. Early twenties, with stringy blonde hair and eyes that darted around like she was waiting for someone to grab her.

“Raymond’s been like a dad,” she said, her voice shaky but grateful. “He helps girls like me. Gives us a place to stay when we’re down.”

“That’s really generous,” I said.

She nodded but didn’t meet my eyes. “Yeah. Real generous.”

I asked where she lived. She hesitated—then murmured, “Nearby,” before slipping behind a group of church ladies.

Things stayed relatively normal for a few weeks. I settled into my routines. Work, home, cheap dinners, old movies. Life felt simple again.

Then, late one night, I heard a sound that cut right through my half-sleep.

A muffled scream.

Not loud—more like someone shouting through layers of walls or blankets. I sat upright, listening, heart pounding. It came again. Desperate. Strained.

I went to the window. Raymond’s house was completely dark.

“It’s an old neighborhood,” I told myself. “Pipes. TV. Arguments.”

I forced myself back to bed.

The next day, I saw Debbie at the corner store. When I asked if she was okay, she practically flinched.

“Me? Yes. Yes, I’m fine.”

“I heard something weird last night. Sounded like someone yelling near Raymond’s place.”

She froze, milk halfway into her basket. “Oh. That. He’s got a dog in the basement. Big thing. Makes weird noises.”

“A dog?” I frowned. “I’ve never seen it.”

She swallowed hard. “You won’t.” Then she hurried out.

Her lie clanged in my head the rest of the day.

That night, I heard the scream again.

Clearer.

I called the police non-emergency line. Two officers came by at dawn, knocking on Raymond’s door. He answered looking freshly showered and confused.

“Noises?” he said, eyebrows raised. “Probably my furnace. Old thing bangs like crazy. Go ahead, check it.”

Twenty minutes later, the officers told me everything seemed fine.

I nodded, embarrassed. But deep down, something remained unsettled.

After that, Debbie disappeared. I didn’t see her at church, or the store, or anywhere. When I asked Raymond about her, he barely blinked.

“She moved,” he said. “Got work upstate.”

I didn’t believe him. His eyes told a different story—hollow, irritated, like my question was an inconvenience he wasn’t expecting.

Two weeks passed.

The screams didn’t stop—they just grew fainter, as though whoever was making them had moved farther underground. I barely slept. Every night, I lay awake waiting for the next thud, the next cry.

One warm afternoon, I was pulling weeds from my front garden when Raymond crossed the street with a toolbox.

“Emily,” he said lightly, “can I borrow you for a minute?”

I stiffened. “For what?”

“My basement light’s burned out. Ladder’s wobbly. Just need someone to hold it.”

My instincts screamed **no**, but I didn’t want to cause a scene. “I… guess.”

Inside, his house smelled different than mine—damp, metallic, like earth after heavy rain mixed with something sour and stale. The living room was pristine, Bible placed perfectly on the coffee table. Nothing out of place.

We went downstairs. The basement was unfinished, concrete walls sweating with moisture. A single bulb hung overhead.

I held the ladder while he replaced it. Simple enough.

But then my eyes drifted to a far wall.

A heavy metal door. Industrial. Bolted and padlocked. The paint around its frame was scratched raw.

“What’s that?” I asked casually, pointing.

Raymond paused mid-step. “Storage. Old coal chute.”

“Looks new.”

“Had to reinforce it. Lots of kids in the neighborhood.”

His laugh was thin. Forced.

I started to turn away when I heard it.

A soft thump.

Then a whisper. Faint but unmistakable.

“Help…”

I froze. Every hair on my arms rose.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

“Hear what?” Raymond stepped toward me, his expression sharpening in a way that made my stomach drop. “Emily… you shouldn’t poke around.”

I backed away. “I’m going home.”

“Emily—”

But I ran. Up the stairs, out the door, across the street, slamming mine shut behind me. My hands shook as I locked every bolt.

That night, the screams were clearer than ever. “Please, no!” I called the police again—this time frantic.

“There’s a locked room in his basement,” I insisted. “Someone is inside.”

They checked. Again. And again Raymond smiled politely. Again, they found “nothing.”

I stopped sleeping.

I went to Raymond’s church and quietly asked about Debbie. An older woman leaned close.

“Raymond takes in troubled girls,” she murmured. “But some say he keeps them too long.”

“Keeps them?” I hissed.

“I don’t know more than that. Just pray, dear.”

I filed a formal report the next morning. I begged a detective to investigate the door.

He said he’d “see what he could do.”

Friday night changed everything.

I heard pounding—slow, rhythmic thuds echoing faintly through the floorboards. Not screams. Not cries. Someone trying to get attention.

I went to my backyard with a flashlight, heart hammering. Through a gap in the fence, I saw Raymond in the dark yard. He was dragging a woman—a limp, unconscious woman—toward a side entrance.

Her bare feet scraped the ground.

“Raymond!” I shouted without thinking.

He jerked upright. His face twisted, finally showing what he’d been hiding.

“Emily,” he growled, “go back inside. This isn’t your business.”

“Who is that?!”

“She’s drunk.” His voice grew sharp. “I’m helping her.”

But she wasn’t moving.

I ran inside, grabbed the phone, dialed 911 with shaking hands. “He’s dragging a body,” I cried. “Please hurry.”

The sirens were the most beautiful sound I had ever heard.

Police flooded the street. Raymond came outside, hands raised, insisting it was all a misunderstanding.

But then they found the key.

Behind the metal door was a nightmare carved into the earth—a hand-dug tunnel, reinforced with wood planks, eight feet deep, stretching under the house like a coffin meant for the living. Six women were inside. Six. Chained to the walls, filthy, starved, bones visible under bruised skin. Some naked. One pregnant.

The smell hit the officers first. Then the silence—broken only by quiet sobbing.

Debbie was there. Barely conscious. “Emily…” she whispered when they carried her out. “He said he loved us… said he’d save us…”

One woman had died—Josefina. Raymond had disposed of her in acid.

Raymond confessed everything. He’d been building the tunnel for years. Luring vulnerable women from bus stations and shelters. Promising help. Promising salvation. Locking them away when they trusted him most.

After the trial, the city bulldozed his house. Mine too, eventually. They wanted the earth sealed forever.

I moved away. Far away. But some nights, when I’m alone, I still wake up to the sound of faint thumps under the floorboards. And every now and then, if the air is still enough, I swear I smell damp earth.

Debbie called me once from the hospital. “Thank you,” she whispered. “I didn’t think anyone would come.”

I still don’t know what to say to that.

I don’t think I ever will.





# ""Blindfolded to Nowhere"":

I had this close friend named Jamal—one of the only constants in my life. We met back in elementary school in Silver Spring, two kids who bonded over basketball games on cracked asphalt and trading Pokémon cards during recess. By the time we hit our twenties, life had pushed us in different directions, but somehow we always circled back to each other. He was the ambitious one, the dreamer, the guy who talked a mile a minute about business ideas and shortcuts to funding his eventual startup. I used to tease him that one day he'd pitch an investor while sprinting to catch a bus.

Last summer, he called me up sounding more charged than I’d heard in years.

“Bro, I got something big,” he said, voice vibrating like he was pacing. “This job I found? It's gonna set me up. Like—actually set me up.”

I laughed. “Yeah? Doing what?”

“Construction,” he said, but it came out too fast. “Digging, building, private contract. The guy’s loaded, pays cash. Just… can’t say too much yet.”

That edge in his voice wasn’t confidence—it was secrecy, the kind that prickled my skin.

“Where is it?” I asked, leaning back in my chair.

He hesitated. “He drives me there. Blindfolded.”

I sat up. “Blindfolded?”

“Security reasons,” he said. “Don’t trip. The guy’s eccentric, but he’s harmless. Trust me. I’ll fill you in soon.”

He hung up before I could push more.

For the next few weeks, he sent short updates—photos of dirt on his boots, texts about digging “another section,” or saying the boss was “weird but harmless.” I told myself he’d pull out if anything felt wrong. Jamal wasn’t stupid.

Then the messages stopped.

A week passed. No calls. He didn’t respond to mine. His parents said they hadn’t seen him, but they weren’t panicked—he’d told them he sometimes stayed on-site. Still, something settled in my stomach, heavy and cold.

I remembered him mentioning the guy rented cars to pick him up. So I drove to the rental agency and bullshitted about being a worried relative. One clerk—an older lady with sharp eyes—remembered Jamal.

“Skinny tall man picked him up a few times,” she said. “Quiet. Didn’t smile.”

She checked the log. I took note of the plate. A friend from DMV owed me a favor. Within an hour, I had an address: a quiet corner of Elmwood Lane.

The kind of suburb where people edged their lawns with military precision. But the house tied to the plate looked like a tumor in the middle of it—grass up to the knees, trash bins overflowing, paint peeling in strips, curtains drawn tight.

I parked a block away and walked up the driveway, heart hammering. The porch boards sagged under my weight. I knocked.

A minute later, the door cracked open.

The man standing there looked like he lived in a permanent state of disarray—late twenties, hair wild, glasses smudged, clothes wrinkled. His eyes flicked over me like he was memorizing my face.

“Can I help you?” he said flatly.

“I’m looking for my friend Jamal,” I said. “He said he was working here.”

His stare deepened. “I don’t know any Jamal.”

“He described you,” I pressed. “The blindfolds. The digging work. Just tell me where he is.”

A tension pinched his face. Then he stepped back. “Come inside.”

Every instinct screamed no, but worry shoved me forward.

Inside, the house was… wrong. Hoarder-level chaos. Piles of newspapers, broken electronics, old snacks, wires crisscrossing the floor. The air was stale, tinged with something chemical—like burnt plastic and mold. Only narrow paths cut through the junk, twisting like maze corridors.

“Sit,” he said, gesturing at a chair buried under clothes. “I’m Alex. Your friend… he’s downstairs working. He’ll be up soon.”

“Downstairs?” I asked. “Why didn’t he come home?”

“He helps me build a shelter,” Alex said, eyes darting toward the hallway. “A bunker. For when the war starts. Missiles, EMPs. People don’t understand, so it’s private.”

I scanned the room—danger everywhere. Wires plugged into wires, overloaded sockets, extension cords looping like vines.

“This place is unsafe,” I said. “Why all the secrecy?”

He didn’t blink. “Security.”

Before I could speak, he walked off down the hallway. “Wait here.”

I waited a minute. Maybe two. Then I heard it—a faint scraping, metal on dirt, echoing from below. And something else: a low mechanical hum.

My pulse thudded. I stood and followed the path he’d taken.

The hallway opened to a door left slightly ajar. Beyond it, stairs descended into dim yellow light. The scraping grew louder.

“Jamal?” I whispered.

No answer.

I went down.

The basement swallowed me in clutter even worse than upstairs—rusted tools, bottles of chemicals, buckets of dirt. And in the center of the concrete floor: a hole. Jagged, raw. Three feet wide. A ladder dropped into it. Ropes dangled like veins.

From below, the scraping continued.

My legs moved before my brain caught up. I grabbed the ladder and climbed down.

It was deeper than I expected—twenty feet, maybe more. I landed in a narrow dirt tunnel, its walls braced with crooked wooden planks. Extension cords ran along the ceiling, powering flickering bulbs spaced far apart.

This wasn’t a bunker. It was a network.

Branches split off in multiple directions, like arteries. Some were half-dug, others reinforced. Dust hung in the air thick enough to taste.

“Jamal?” I called again.

Then I heard it—voices.

“One of the circuits blew again,” Jamal said, strained and faint.

Alex replied, “It’s fine. Keep working.”

I rounded a bend. There he was. Jamal. Shirtless, covered in soil, dark rings under his eyes. Swinging a pickaxe into the wall while Alex shone a flashlight over his shoulder.

“Jamal,” I said.

He froze. Turned. His face went pale. “What are you doing down here?”

“You disappeared,” I said. “I had to find you.”

Alex whipped around, anger twisting his mouth. “You shouldn’t be here.”

Jamal wiped sweat from his forehead. “Bro, you gotta get out. This place is a death trap.”

As if summoned by his words, a burst of blue-white sparks erupted from one of the cords overhead. A loud pop. Then the bulbs flickered… and died.

Darkness slammed down.

My phone slipped from my hand, hit the dirt, and skittered away.

A smell filled the air—chemical, sharp, burning.

Smoke.

“Fire!” I shouted.

Jamal grabbed my arm. “The ladder—we have to move!”",1,1764335887.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1p8ukf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p8ukf1/tell_me_not_to_call_him/,Tell me not to call him,"I was with my ex for seven months. We met at karaoke one night. He told me I had pretty eyes, he made me feel like the only girl in the room, and he got my number and we started chatting that night.  A week later he took me golfing. He wanted to play 18 holes, but I thought nine was enough time to spend with somebody I don’t know that well. It was my birthday that day, but I didn’t tell him that because I didn’t want him to feel weird or pressured. For a second date, he took me out to dinner. The restaurant closed at 10 so we said our goodbyes and I headed home.  Not even 10 minutes later I called him to ask how far he had gotten because I wasn’t ready to call it a night! We met at another bar and talked for hours more. Over the next six weeks, we talked every day. He took me out two or three times a week. About two months and we started sleeping together. The first night he invited me to stay over, he got a call that he would have to go do a side job in the morning. I assumed he was telling me so that he could send me home and get up early in the morning. I started packing up my stuff and he was like no I just meant you’ll have to lock up in the morning when you head home, I still want you to stay!This man got up at 3:30 to go weld something and left me alone in his house with coffee and a key. I started falling. I began staying at his place on the weekends when I didn’t have my kids. He’d cook for me and we’d dance in the kitchen. My ex-husband was an abusive POS. I had never been treated this good before. 3 1/2 months in I introduced him to my kids. He took us out for dinner for my children’s birthday. A month later, he was staying with me for Christmas and teaching my oldest to ride his new dirtbike. He took me to a fundraiser, a dance at the local Legion and when his friends asked who I was, he said, “this is my girlfriend.”  I fell in love with him that night as he danced me around the room. Another couple of months were spent ordering takeout and watching movies on the couch, going to the golf simulator, meeting his friends and even meeting his brother and sister in law. It felt perfect. I should have known, right? 

The house he lived in was owned together by him and his ex girlfriend. She moved out when they broke up and he had been hoping to buy her out and keep the place. She had her father retained a lawyer, however, and he would be forced to sell. He had a meeting with her and a real estate agent and within weeks everything we had started falling apart. After realizing he would have to let go of the house he seemed to become a different person over night.  He disappeared for three days and told me he had some things to figure out. Three days later he told me we were done. I told him he at least owed me a conversation. He agreed and I went over to his house. He had already started painting and packing and fixing. We talked in circles with him saying he still felt the same way about me, but just didn’t feel like he could maintain a relationship. And then me begging to keep him in my life even if it wasn’t the same extent as we had set the precedent for. He agreed but that did not last long. Eventually, it felt like I was a booty call and nothing more. It started to feel like he didn’t care about me or respect me. I told him I was in love with him and had to say goodbye so that I could keep the good memories I had of him and the beginning of our relationship. At this point, I just didn’t recognize him anymore and it started to feel wrong, begging for scraps of affection. I didn’t block him but I unfriended and unfollowed everything. For two months he left me alone. Just two months. He reached out and said he still doesn’t have much to give but that he wants to see me. He lives two hours away now. I agreed to meet him the next day but then he said he had to work late and couldn’t see me.  Another 10 days went by without hearing from him.  I sent him one more message which he read and did not respond to.  I then blocked him because I don’t know who this man is and it hurts so bad. That was two weeks ago and I can’t stop thinking about him. 

Tell me to forget him. Tell me not to call him.

Now everything is messed up.,"Hey guys, I need some advice because I feel extremly overwhelmed by this whole situation. Please excuse my English, I‘m not a native speaker and trying my best.

Okay, so I am engaged to a great guy (m/34), I love him, never want to leave him. We have a great relationship. 

Two months ago I met another guy who transferred to my faculty at my university (we are both PhD-students), and we became fast friends. We have exactly the same interests, have amazing conversations, he is very smart and has had a very rough live. He is also in a six year relationship with his girlfriend. We started having our coffee breaks together to talk about recent developments in our shared field as well as literature, philosophy and other academic stuff we‘re both into and also watched movies together (in a group with other PhD-students). We met up privately twice to talk about academic articles we wanted to discuss and had coffee during. I was really happy about this as I have no other friends to talk to about this and felt comfortable in the dynamic – after all we are both in long term relationships, knew about the others partners and talked about them as well. In my opinion I never gave him romantic vibes or anything to give him the idea I would be sexually or romantically interested in him, unless you consider a man and a woman meeting up romantic per se (which I think is crazy, men and women obviously CAN be just friends). 

A few days this guy confessed his undying love for me. He says he has never felt this way before, wants to be with me, wants to leave his gf for me, I‘m THE ONE and so on. He said he never felt this understood and feels like everything bad that ever happend to him happened just so he could meet me. He even wrote me a beautiful love poem. I truly believe he was telling the truth and really believes himself to be my other half (or rather for me to be his other half). I however dont want to be in a romantic relationship with him, told him so and left. He left me some very sad messages on wanting to wait for me in case I ever feel differently about the whole thing. The whole talk was emotionally devestating, he cried and even ran after me into the rain after I left. I contacted his best friend to take care of him as I was afraid he would hurt himself

Now for the problem: He workes in the office right next to mine. I also genuinly miss having him as my friend, and I miss talking to him. Going to the office is horrible now as I‘m always afraid we‘ll run into each other. I would like to have some normalcy. Is there any way for this to be less awkward? Can we ever be just friends? Would it be horrible of me to ask him to meet up to talk about how we can be friends and coworkers as I dont wish for my work to be impacted negatively? Would it be better to just wait it out? (Also: I live in a country where there is no HR-department or anything and we don‘t work under the same supervisor, so there is no one at work who would be responsible in this type of situation.)",0,1764335047.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

* “We should collaborate!”
* “Let’s keep in touch” → *never talks again*

Can we just go outside, eat good food, touch grass, and maybe… I don’t know… *enjoy life without exchanging LinkedIns?*

Is anyone else craving real friendships here?

1p8u9cm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8u9cm,My living room looks like a witness protection safehouse. Which rug fixes this?,"Hey Reddit,

I have recently moved into my own place and my living room currently has the exact “just moved in yesterday… six weeks ago” aesthetic. It’s basically a grey couch, a wooden coffee table, wooden floors (slide 1) and the crushing awareness that I am now responsible for making this space look like an adult lives here.

So I decided the first step toward adulthood is a rug. Naturally, instead of picking one like a normal person, I spiralled and ended up with a long list of 17 options from Ruggable. Please don’t judge me, or do, but also help.

I’m 30-ish, want the room to feel warm and cozy, but also like I’ve vaguely got my life together. Eventually I’ll add more stuff (art, plants, maybe personality), but for now I need a rug that won’t make future-me say “why did you do that?”

Which one would you pick for this space? Bonus points if you roast my current minimalist hostage-situation setup.

Thanks in advance, rug experts, interior design wizards, and people who just enjoy giving strangers opinions.",36,1764334827.0,malelivingspace,54,0.88,False

1p8u6yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p8u6yw/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_marriage/,I don’t know what to do about my marriage,"
Hi! This is my first time posting on Reddit, so please be kind 😅. I (34F) am married for about 10yrs (38M), no kids. My marriage wasn’t the best but not the worst I would say: we both made mistakes and hold our part of the blame but I feel like my husband made some mistakes that are quite heavy. 
For context: 4yrs ago he decided he wanted to move to another country in Europe bc of his job(he couldn’t take it anymore) and didn’t like the country we were born in. So he moved to another one once he got a job. We did not discuss this thoroughly and decide how would that look for us and what to do. I did not have the courage then to say that he should not move bc I was aware of his situation at work. So he moved and we had a long distance relationship: he would come back to homecountry, I would visit him, we would talk etc. He wanted me to move with him but in the first year I wasn’t sure. Second year I decided to find a job myself and move, but life is life and other problems appear with my father (health issues) and I was having a really hard finding a job. I thought it was important for me to sustain myself and not to move without some level of certainty. I had hhigh hopes for a job in Oct 2023 and they dis not accepted me. I was tired, frustrated, upset, dealing with some health issues myself, my father and some other issues as well. I told my husband I would not move: I was sick of rejections and his insistence of moving (even without a job). We spent a few weeks where we did not exactly talked. At some point in December I had a gut feeling and started to look in his browsing history( he had a connected computer at home). I saw there that he downloaded tinder app and some dating sites (he filled in a profile ,had matches etc.). I felt like the earth collapsed around me…I did not mention anything to him because in a few days he would fly home for Christmas vacation. 

I confronted them then: he has a bit surprised that I found out but he considered that he did not do anything wrong bc we were talking at that point. Ofc the conversations where heated, he said at some point that he is sorry and doesn’t want to loose me. We decided eventually to continue our marriage. 

In January 2024, I moved out of the country bc I have found a job, the other problems were fixed eventually. Moving and settling was not easy for me, as I was missing my home and friends, and the grass wasn’t fully greener in this other country . Job was difficult in the beginning. And our bedroom was not very great. I accumulated more frustration and doubts. 

To a point in April 2024 where we had a really big fight and while leaving together we barely talked and we “agreed” that we would divorce when we got back home for a vacation (it was upcoming in 3weeks or so). We fought so hard and many things were said(mainly from him): how I was fat and he was always ashamed to walk on the street with me, how our sex life suffered from it, how I was disrespectful towards him, how he wants our marriage to be over, how he never felt loved and I don’t show it and many other (I cannot even remember them all). 

We had many discussions in the upcoming days and again…we decided to continue the marriage (although he was sure we will not be able to repair). Told him I did not know what hurt him through the marriage and this is how he felt. 

Promised I would work on myself (physically and to show more love and respect). And we continued….we had in the meantime more discussions about boundaries, about what we did wrong, how him leaving hurt me so bad. 

We made a few changes trying to be better. I lost weight (not skinny yet🥲), I show him more love, I am respectful and supportive. But….the trust was broken so bad….I had many ups and downs towards our relationship. 

I now find myself in situations where I compare myself with any woman, or thinking if he is truly happy with me, if he desires someone else, is he lusting etc. I am looking still for signs of potential cheating…and one day I found out that in fact he kept installing and reinstalling tinder and other dating sites pretty much since the first week he landed in the new country. I was devastated again… he wasn’t fully honest with me when we had the though discussions and I had to look and find out myself. 

This tells me that he moved here committed to start a new life with someone else….he says he was curious to see how are the women here, but curiosity is looking once or twice, and not having a pattern with this. He also distorted the situation in December 2023 when I first found out about that recent account and blame it on the fact that we were not talking.  He admitted that we would use incognito searches to access the other dating websites. He also says he never went physical with nobody because that would have been a big step and he has values and principles….

The reality here is that I will probably not find this one out with a 100% certainty…and it’s killing me.

“Fast forward “ to the present year: he suggested to use the Find my function from Apple, he is coming home regularly, he doesn’t go out in a suspicious way, we spent time together (which in the past did not happen as he would prioritise video gaming all the time), doesn’t hide or protect his phone, he shared passwords with me etc.

There was also another twist: at his current job, a female co worker was hired…He showed her to me on the street( it was randomly) and I probably made face about the situation…
At some point this year I noticed he never talks about her, never mentioned her…nothing. And that was a bit suspicious. 

So I took a peak on his Teams chat looking to see how are the interactions between them. And the interactions were a bit too friendly for a man who is married: he would ask to go together for coffee, she would to the same (at work, in their coffee area), asking each other to go for lunch (at work), him asking her if she is in the office or not, or tell her when he will be in the office. 

To me, this means: they have interactions a lot at work and he would intentionally not tell me about it when I ask how was his day… she is not part of his team or him of hers…they are equal and part of a bigger team along with others. I talked to him about this…and he said he did not want to tell bc of how I would react, or that it would upset me, that she is just a colleague and they are a bit younger then the rest of the people so they have more in common. That even if he was single, he wouldn’t date her etc. 

Before finding out about their interactions there were a few things that were also strange: she is a personal trainer at another gym in a different part of the city. Me and my husband we go to the gym: at some point he said: i will start taking creatine daily, or skip cardio after a leg day bc the muscles are not growing etc. I connected the dots and realised that she was giving him advice and he would follow them blindly. He said he did not wanted to tell me bc of how I would react…And there are other stories like this.

….and today I still feel he doesn’t share with me much ( most time I have to fish for information although I asked for transparency), I think that maybe he fancies her, he wants something more…I am in a constant loop of comparing myself, I don’t trust him even if he changed a few things( I believe he stays with me out of comfort and familiarity), I don’t feel desired and wanted and seen. 
Generally he says he is happy with me, the sex is better than ever, our “connection “ is different, that he understands and sees the past mistakes….but they haunt me…almost daily. He comes home, and I immediately think: is he happy bc his co worker as in the office, does he want to have sex bc I am at hand, does he think about others women when we have sex…etc. 

I feel like this is no way of living (constantly checking and worrying) and I can’t shake the feeling that he is not honest about his time spent alone in the past or about his co worker. 
We speak about this from time to time but I don’t want to bring it up too often as it’s tiring for both. 
I also started therapy hoping that I can understand myself better and become better.

The doctor, two separate ones, both told me to take it daily and take breaks on weekends.

The first day I took the 18mg was bliss - like someone closed the windows next to a busy highway, and covered me with a warm blanket. I could focus, make conversation effortlessly, and I could regulate my emotional responses.

Every day after that, whether I made a 1-3 day break, or took the meds few days in a row, I am flat, depleated, foggy, I can start work but I overlook details and can't really focus my eyes, and I get a bit irritable. Waking up is much easier though, and my depression is not actively hurting.

I have no idea what to do. I fear that if I take them too long in a row I'll fall into a depression pit and the meds will start working less.

I do my best to take them at the same time, avoid coffee/driving to not ramp up adrenaline, and I eat before and after taking them.

Anyone that had a similar reaction have any advice on how to space them? Do I do it ""as needed"" or try and push through daily use, if it is safe? Thank you for sharing your experience < 3",2,1764334566.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

And how can I find out the cause of brain fog?","Hello. I’m 18, male. I’m coming to you with a question and asking for help.
In 2019, during the first wave of COVID, I got COVID. Before that, the only health issue I had was mild OCD that appeared rarely and was related to religious topics, but it didn’t really bother me. After I had COVID, I developed all the symptoms I describe below.

At the moment I have: brain fog, depersonalization and derealization, depression, blurry vision, severe OCD, forgetfulness (possibly related to OCD), bags under my eyes. Because of all this, sometimes it’s hard for me to walk — I walk unsteadily and sometimes lose balance, swaying from side to side. One of the important symptoms is sleepiness/fatigue that never goes away. Sometimes I think how great I would feel if I just wasn’t this exhausted. So far, I’ve only managed to slightly reduce this fatigue by waking up early — on these days I feel a bit more energetic.

I also want to say that right after COVID my OCD suddenly became much stronger and started interfering with everything I did, not letting me live normally, even though I didn’t feel any fear during the pandemic. That’s why I tend to think COVID did something biochemical that could have worsened the OCD.

I read an article on selfhack.com that said these conditions go hand in hand because of limbic system exhaustion, and that if a person was fine before a viral infection, then the infection is most likely the cause. But I don’t understand how to find the real reason, because depression feels like the last thing I’m able to “check.” So I’m asking you to help me figure this out.

What’s interesting is that I rarely get short moments of partial clarity lasting about 15 minutes. During these moments, my vision becomes normal, I start realizing where I am and what I’m seeing in front of me, and movements that usually feel strange and sharp become smooth and I can actually feel them. My gait becomes more confident because I start feeling the ground under my feet. These clarity episodes have different triggers: sometimes it happens from Ginkgo biloba, other times during a walk, a couple of times after coffee. Once, they took three tubes of blood for several tests, and after about two and a half hours I had a clarity episode that lasted a few minutes. Can this happen simply during post-COVID depression?

Here is what I have already tried:
MRI of the brain, duplex ultrasound of the neck vessels, many blood tests (clotting, viscosity, inflammatory markers, erythrocytes, important vitamins, testosterone, folic acid, cortisol, important vitamins, etc.), thyroid hormones, an oxygen saturation test (the fingertip one). Everything was normal.

I took: glycine, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, Mexidol, ribose capsules, magnesium.

• I received 10-day courses of Cerebrolysin IV twice.

• For a long time I had a deviated nasal septum, so I had surgery a month ago.

• I tried the keto diet, then water fasting for two days. There was no improvement.

None of this helped, except for partial improvements from Cerebrolysin, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, and Mexidol.
A psychotherapist prescribed Zoloft because they diagnosed me with depression. I’ve been taking it for 3 months now. There is some improvement, but I’m still not sure if it’s just depression.",2,1764334514.0,covidlonghaulers,1,0.75,False

[FILE PHOTO: A sample of monazite, a mineral used in the rare earth industry to extract elements such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium, is displayed next to a magnification glass at the Geological Museum of China in Beijing, China, October 14, 2025.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The EU executive will unveil next week measures to cut the bloc's over-reliance on China for critical raw materials as Europe seeks to keep up with fierce global competition from the U.S. and Asia.

Despite years of warning signs that the old model of rules-based trade was coming to an end, accelerated by U.S. President Donald Trump's return to power, European governments have been asleep at the wheel, EU and industry officials said. 

""Europe has become more vulnerable, also due to our dependency on third countries for our security and the supply of critical raw materials,"" European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said last week, citing other challenges ranging from rising U.S. tariffs to stiffening competition from China. 

""Europe’s vulnerabilities stem from having a growth model geared towards a world that is gradually disappearing.""       

Beijing's threat of new curbs on rare earth exports to the West in October, on top of restrictions announced in April, has caused fresh panic in European car, clean energy and semiconductor sectors all heavily dependent on them.

EU's Industry Commissioner Stephane Sejourne said this week Europe was not just a collateral victim of trade tensions between the U.S. and China but ""directly targeted"". 

The Economic Security Doctrine to be unveiled on Wednesday aims to make Europe's industry more self-sufficient and includes a plan for critical raw materials, called ResourceEU - mimicking the RePowerEU scheme of weaning itself off Russian oil and gas.

Yet curbing the EU's dependence on Beijing will be harder than ending its reliance on Russian natural gas. The materials are not easily substitutable like gas, and China is by far the cheapest and dominates both extraction and processing know-how.    

Industry and EU officials said the EU will face the problem of how to pay for creating its own, critical raw materials and rare earths industry, often from scratch, from mines to extraction, processing and stockpiling.

A quick solution is to immediately allocate 3 billion euros from the EU's budget to the most urgent 25 of the 60 strategic projects in the rare earths and raw materials sector listed by the Commission, one EU official told Reuters.

The 25 projects would produce rare earths, gallium, germanium and lithium, the official said, adding the measures to be proposed should take care of that financing. 

But longer term funding remains a challenge. To ensure their investments will pay off, companies seek guaranteed minimum prices or other guarantees - options the Commission is studying. 

The EU is looking to the European Investment Bank, owned by EU governments, for funding and to the EU's Global Gateway plan - its version of China's Belt and Road scheme - to invest in projects that would benefit third countries and the EU. 

The Commission will also include critical raw materials projects as eligible investments for an existing EU Innovation Fund. But industry remains sceptical.

""Time is against the EU. They have been too slow,"" Mika Seitovirta, an executive at mining firm Sibanye-Stillwater, told Reuters. 

The Commission mindset has been ""in the way"", an EU official explained. ""We are asking them to be more like project managers and to lift any obstacles.""

GLOBAL COMPETITION

Industry executives warn the EU could lose out to the U.S. and other Western allies like Japan, Canada and Australia who are throwing billions of dollars behind global supply diversification efforts. 

""We need to see fast-track permitting in Europe and Norway and the second point is price security,"" Alf Reifstad, CEO of Rare Earths Norway, told Reuters. Reifstad said he was also in talks with the U.S. though he prioritised the EU. Norway holds Europe's largest rare earth reserves. 

The EU is working to secure resources in third countries in places like Brazil, Central Asia and most recently South Africa and Australia but political agreements have yet to translate into concrete investments. 

The U.S. set industry expectations after the Pentagon signed a rare earths deal guaranteeing a minimum price and the U.S. recently poached European supplies and knowledge. 

Recycling will be a major pillar to make up for the dearth of existing European mines and long development time for new production to come online. 

""You need input materials for recycling. All options are on the table in terms of trade measures,"" the senior EU official with knowledge of the package said.     

The Commission has also launched a pilot stockpile mechanism with some EU countries to jointly buy and store critical raw materials to get a better price and supply certainty. 

But there will be no decisions on where, how and which materials to keep in storage until a new critical minerals centre, inspired by Japan, is up and running next year.

China's stranglehold on the rare earths industry -- from natural reserves and mining through processing and innovation -- is the result of a decades-long drive, now giving Beijing crucial leverage in its trade war with the United States.

The 17 key elements will play a vital role in the global economy in coming years, as analysts warn that plans to secure alternative supply chains by Western governments could take years to bear fruit.

Rare earths are crucial for the defence sector -- used in fighter jets, missile guidance systems and radar technology -- while also having a range of uses in everyday products including smartphones, medical equipment and automobiles.

Visited this month by AFP, the southeastern mining region of Ganzhou -- which specialises in ""heavy"" rare earths including yttrium and terbium -- was a hive of activity.

Media access to the secretive industry is rarely granted in China, but despite near-constant surveillance by unidentified minders, AFP journalists saw dozens of trucks driving in and out of one rare earths mine, in addition to several bustling processing facilities.

Sprawling new headquarters are being built in Ganzhou for China Rare Earth Group, one of the country's two largest state-owned companies in the industry following years of consolidation directed by Beijing.

Challenges this year have ""paved the way for more countries to look into expanding rare earth metal production and processing"", Heron Lim, economics lecturer at ESSEC Business School, told AFP.

""This investment could pay longer-term dividends,"" he said.

\- Trade war -

Sweeping export restrictions China imposed on the sector in early October sent shockwaves across global manufacturing sectors.

The curbs raised alarm bells in Washington, which has been engaged in a renewed trade war with Beijing since President Donald Trump began his second term.

At a high-stakes meeting in South Korea late last month, Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in a blistering tariff war between the world's top two economies.

The deal -- which guarantees supply of rare earths and other critical minerals, at least temporarily -- effectively neutralised the most punishing US measures and was widely seen as a victory for Beijing.

""Rare earths are likely to remain at the centre of future Sino-US economic negotiations despite the tentative agreements thus far,"" Heron Lim told AFP.

""China has demonstrated its willingness to use more trade levers to keep the United States at the negotiating table,"" he said.

""The turbulence has created a challenging environment for producers that rely on various rare earth metals, as near-term supply is uncertain.""

Washington and its allies are now racing to develop alternative mining and processing chains, but experts warn that process will take years.

\- Supremacy ceded -

During the Cold War, the United States led the way in developing abilities to extract and process rare earths, with the Mountain Pass mine in California providing the bulk of global supplies.

But as tensions with Moscow eased and the substantial environmental toll wrought by the rare earth industry gained prominence, the United States gradually offshored capacity in the 1980s and 1990s.

Now, China controls most of global rare earths mining -- around two thirds, by most estimates.

It is already home to the world's largest natural reserves of the elements of any country, according to geological surveys.

And it has a near total monopoly on separation and refining, with analysis this year showing a share of around nine tenths of all global processing.

Furthermore, a commanding lead in patents and strict export controls on processing technology solidify efforts by Beijing to prevent know-how from leaving the country.

""The United States and the European Union are heavily reliant on imports of rare earth elements, underscoring significant risks to critical industries,"" said Amelia Haines, commodities analyst at BMI, at a seminar this month.

""This sustained risk is likely to catalyse a faster, broader pivot towards rare earth security,"" she said.

\- Chasing alternatives -

US defence authorities have in recent years directed large sums towards shoring up domestic production -- part of efforts to achieve a ""mine-to-magnet"" supply chain by 2027.

Washington has also been working with allies to develop extraction and processing alternatives to China.

Trump signed a rare earths deal last month promising $8.5 billion in critical minerals projects with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia -- its vast territory home to extensive rare earth resources.

The US president also signed cooperation deals covering the critical minerals sector last month with Japan, Malaysia and Thailand.

Despite the flurry of activity and headlines this year, Washington has been aware of its rare earths problem for years.

In 2010, a maritime territorial dispute with Tokyo prompted Beijing to suspend shipments of the minerals to Japan -- the first major incident highlighting geopolitical ramifications of China's control over the sector.

The episode sparked calls by the administration of then-president Barack Obama to shore up US domestic resilience in the strategic field.

But 15 years later, China remains the chief rare earths power.

# 📌 How Niocorp, IBC, Lockheed, DOE, and the NDAA quietly built a U.S. Sc-Al ecosystem

# 🟦 OPINION: What’s Really Going On with Scandium, Niocorp, and the U.S. Defense World

# 1️⃣ 2015–2019: The Warm-Up

Scandium was a tiny, niche metal.  
U.S. labs (like AMES/DOE) and defense companies quietly tested it because Sc-Aluminum is super strong and super light.  
Niocorp proved Elk Creek had Scandium.  
IBC proved you can actually make Sc-Al parts in the U.S.  
**Nobody did anything big yet because there wasn’t enough supply in the world.**

# 2️⃣ 2020–2022: The DoD Starts Caring

COVID exposed how weak the global metal supply chain was.  
The Pentagon began paying serious attention to scandium for jets, missiles, and 3D-printed parts.  
**BUT — everyone realized Sc is useless unless someone makes 100+ tonnes a year.**  
**Only Niocorp could realistically do that in the U.S.**

# 3️⃣ 2023–2024: Congress Puts Scandium Into Law

**The NDAAs (defense bills) for 2023 and 2024 officially list scandium and Sc-Al alloys as strategic.**  
**This is a big deal — Congress basically said:**

“We want scandium and we want it made here at home.”  
Around this time, Lockheed, Boeing, and DOE ramp up testing.  
(DINGMAN)\~Analysts start mentioning February 2026 as a key scandium milestone.  
**That’s extremely unusual unless something real is happening behind the scenes!**

# 4️⃣ 2025–2026: The Scandium Hub Starts Forming

**By 2025, the signs are everywhere:**

* Niocorp close to a DFS update
* IBC, Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, AMES lab & others are improving Sc-Al alloying
* Lockheed testing Sc-Al parts for components & platforms ""PLURAL""
* Project Pivot + Boeing in the UK doing the same!
* DOE & DoD pushing lightweight alloys

Everyone finally admits the truth:  
Selling Sc oxide alone is pointless.  
**But a full “mine → alloy → parts” hub is worth billions!**  
That’s the model titanium used in the 1950s — and IMHO scandium is following the same playbook.

# 5️⃣ I'm thinking~2027–2029: The U.S. Scandium System Goes Live

As Niocorp builds the mine, everything else builds with it:

* Sc oxide → Elk Creek
* Sc-Al alloy → IBC + partners
* Parts → Lockheed, Boeing, defense OEMs
* Recycling → to close the loop

**By 2028–2029, the U.S. finally has:**  
**Mine → Metal → Alloy → Components → Platforms → Recycle**

# This is the first real scandium supply chain in American history, and Niocorp is the anchor.

[ALL SEVEN OF NIOCORP'S CRITICAL MINERALS ARE ON FIRE! \~ Niobium, Titanium & TiCl-4, Scandium & ScAl alloys, Terbium, Dysprosium, Neodymium & Praseodymium\~](https://reddit.com/link/1p8u46t/video/50ub3vswuz3g1/player)

# 🔥PLUS:  The Real Reason Niocorp Stands Alone in the U.S. Critical Minerals Game

What makes Niocorp different isn’t just ""Scandium"" — it’s the **entire suite above** of defense-critical materials **it brings online** ***in one place***\*\*. No other U.S. project can match this combination. Elk Creek delivers:\*\*

* **Scandium** – for ultra-strong Sc-Al alloys (hypersonics, AM, aerospace).
* **Niobium (Ferroniobium)** – essential for high-strength steels, jet structures, SMRs, and armor.
* **Titanium / TiCl₄** – for aerospace alloys, coatings, catalysts, and next-gen manufacturing.
* **Neodymium & Praseodymium (Nd/Pr)** – permanent magnets for jets, drones, missiles, and EV motors.
* **Dysprosium & Terbium (Dy/Tb)** – heavy REEs that make those magnets high-temp & military grade.

Put simply:  
**Niocorp is the only U.S. project capable of producing ALL SEVEN critical materials the Pentagon depends on for future aircraft, hypersonics, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.**

**This is why the NDAAs flag these materials.**  
This is why Lockheed, Boeing, DOE, AMES, and defense labs keep circling back.  
This is why IBC, Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, L-3 processing, & other partners work matters!!  
And this is why **IMHO** a full **mine → oxide → alloy → component** ecosystem is forming around Elk Creek.

**No other U.S. critical minerals project checks every box at once — not MP, not Lynas USA, not anyone!**

Niocorp is the only one that can become a **single-site strategic metals hub** powering multiple defense and industrial supply chains at the same time.

# Elk Creek is a “U.S. National Security Asset” & its moment has arrived! — 🛰️⚡

1p8u3lt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8u3lt,Gurgaon to Hansi - Full trip diary in caption,"Left for Hansi in the morning around 8. The route goes via Najafgarh, connecting to NH9, which passes through Rohtak, Madina, and Meham. Hansi comes before Hisar, approximately 20 km away. The distance from Najafgarh to Hansi is about 140 km, and the first 40 minutes can be tiring due to weekday traffic in Najafgarh if you leave around 8 a.m. Once on the highway, the road is smooth with no major potholes. I maintained a speed between 80–90 km/h, and my average speed came out to around 57–60 km/h.

The highway is good and has plenty of eating options, but based on my weekday experience, I would rather have breakfast beforehand and have lunch at Rohtak. I prefer eating at places with more footfall.

Since I’m on a strict diet, I had breakfast at home. You’ll find Burger King and KFC within the first 60 km, but they were closed at 9 a.m.; they open at 10. I then stopped at Prince Zenq Express. I mainly wanted to feel warm and wasn’t in the mood to eat, so I had a hazelnut coffee at Barista. It was awesome and refreshing. Then I started again and took two 5-minute breaks to stretch my legs and avoid a stiff neck.

I love historical monuments, and the aim of this road trip was to enjoy a bike ride, the morning sun, and visit Prithvi Raj Chauhan’s fort in Hansi (Asigarh Fort). The ride was about 137 km and took me 2 hours 27 minutes of engine-on time.

The fort is mostly in ruins—there isn’t much to see except a tomb and an unused dargah. However, the site has a rich history; refer to the photograph for more details. Other places worth visiting in Hansi include Barsi Gate, the Hansi Archaeological Museum, and Dargah Char Qutub.

By now, I was hungry. It was almost 12 p.m. There are restaurants in Hansi, but I didn’t want to wait another hour for them to open and serve food. This is the best part of solo trips—you can do whatever you want, whenever you want, as per your convenience.

So I started again, ate two bananas, and headed back to Gurgaon. After about 1.5 hours, I reached Mannat Haveli in Rohtak and had an excellent meal of sarso ka saag with makki ki roti and a generous amount of white butter. It was delicious, though a bit expensive at around ₹400, but hygienic and fresh.

After another hour, I reached home. I was fully satisfied, and the X440 performed really well. It gave me an average of 32.7 km/l. Total time taken was 4.47 hours, and the total distance traveled was 272 km. I love this bike—the sound, the stability, and the power. ",2,1764334353.0,indianbikes,1,1.0,False
1p8u3gc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8u3gc,My living room looks like a witness protection safehouse. Which rug fixes this?,"Hey Reddit,

I’m not ready to share anything more than that with family, so I’m just sharing smaller goals. 
One of the things that has helped me stay focused is to try to imagine what it would feel like if I did have a drink in that moment. Would it enhance anything? Likely not. I’d still be overstimulated, but my temper would be a lot shorter with my family, and I’d snap and say something I’d regret. I’d still be tired, except I’d probably have started drinking coffee to stay awake so I could drink more when I got home. I’d be peeing every half hour 🥴 I would definitely be oversharing to a point of embarrassment. 

Instead, I came home, watched some TV with my husband, went to bed at 930 and slept HARD, and now I’m awake Friday morning feeling clear and content, and headed to the gym soon. My first sober night was Halloween, and I count that as holiday #1, so making progress on not drinking through the holiday season and beyond!

1p8u1m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertrophy/comments/1p8u1m6/supplements_that_actually_work/,Supplements that actually work,"Beginners who get into lifting think supplements are like some kind of magic. Truth is, only a few actually do anything and most are just scam. Here is no bullshit list , ill try to keep it short:

# Whey Protein

It’s just protein. It's a simple and quick way to get an extra 20-30g(1 scoop) of protein but don’t feel like eating more. Not necessary if you get enough from food and won’t make you bulk or cut on its own , it just helps your muscles recover and grow when combined with training.

# Creatine Monohydrate

Most studied supplement ever. It basically lets you push harder, lift heavier and do more reps for short period of time. Safe for healthy adults and you don't need a loading phase, , just take 5g daily(timing doesn't matter) and don't think about it. More work = more muscle over time , not magic.

# Caffeine

No brainer. It's CNS stimulant that gives a short term boost in focus, energy, and performance. 100-300mg 30 minutes before workout ,usually one cup of coffee usually does the job. Just be careful with timing it can stay in your system 4-6 hours and late intake can mess up your sleep. Also caffeine doesn’t actually stop fatigue , just tricks your brain by blocking adenosine, the chemical that makes you feel tired.

# Beta Alanine

It's included in most preworkouts. Basically delays fatigue so you can last longer before your muscles start burning. Take 3.2-6.4g daily (again doesn’t matter when , just like creatine it's effects come from building up). You may feel itching which is normal and goes away , but to prevent it you can split the doses e.g 3.2g before workout, 3.2g with a meal.

# Omega 3(EPA/DHA)

It won’t give you a boost in the gym directly, but it’s essential for long term recovery, lowering muscle soreness and overall joint health. So if you are not a fish person like me and eat fish once per 2 months ,consider getting around 1-2g of EPA+DHA daily.

# Vitamin D

If you live in a place with little sunlight or spend most of your time indoors you most likely have deficit. It’s essential for bone health, mood, and supporting your immune system. 1000-2000 IU daily is a safe bet. People think it's only for winter months , but you can still be low in summer , especially if you're indoors a lot or wear sunscreen.

None of these are magic. They only help on top of solid diet, good training, quality sleep , if your foundation isn't there , they won't do much except empty your pocket.

# Jan 04, 2025: Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness

*Sidhe* 

My guest is serving tea when the door knocks.  He smiles.  “Come in!” He doesn’t look at it. We are having a delightful time, and I am truly enjoying it.

Todd, the troll that is one of Pat’s favored, walks in. I immediately see it. When did he become an ArchFae, wait, he has a crown…

The look of shock must be evident on my face as Frank turns to look. He drops his teapot. “Oh boy.  Look, Todde, the Fox of Yorkshire, I am very sorry for our altercation all those decades ago. I warn you, if you have come for revenge, please wait until I am no longer under the Queen’s protection…”

What an odd way for Frank to phrase this. He seems genuinely worried about a troll that he believes is here to kill him?

I prepare for an actual fight to defend him when I see Todd’s hands raise and he laughs. He motions for another person to walk inside. I see a vampire show up. My friend gasps. Todd starts to talk, “So funny thing…”

 

**Some time later**

“You are not angry then?” This mage, my friend, is remarkably composed. I smile as Todd shrugs.

“I won’t lie, losing myself for almost 50 years sucked. I am kinda miffed. But not at you. I kinda brought that onto myself when I attacked you and was too angry to listen. Carl was the first human to not hate me. I think the pain of losing him was too much.”

My friend nods. “I never raised him, by the way. I tested his blood and organs. The disease he died from was so rare that it made no sense. His immune system should have dealt with it. I found a virus had destroyed that immune system. I tried to sound a warning. Not many listened. I hate that things got so bad just because the powers that be considered it a disease that only affected gay men and as such was fine to run rampant. As if the men were vermin.”

Todd looks very sad. I begin to empathize. He had a human he loved. He lost them.

The vampire brightens the mood with the most hilarious statement I have heard in months. “I owe you for about 10 liters of blood.”

We all laugh. Frank looks at the vampire and shakes his head. “Anton, you realize I only charge you so that you don’t feel bad, right? You have a communicable disease that you could spread through feeding if not cautious. You chose to look for a way to reduce the pain, suffering, and chance to spread it from feeding to zero. The moment you asked I was bound and determined to help you.“

I hear something I never thought I would from Anton. His heart beats twice.

What?!

# Jan 04, 2025: Patricia Rae Wallace

*Human? Fae? Both? Both!  Yes both!*

I am so frustrated. My selfishness in wanting to spend all that time with Jackie and Connie have caused my family problems. John told me he was holding on to a sobbing Mona yesterday. I happen to have her scheduled today so I am waiting when she comes in.

She is wearing an outfit that is very modest. No button trying to break free or anything. I am terrified. What happened?!

“Mona, please clock in and come to my office. Nothing bad, I promise. I am doing a wellness check.”

She looks at me and smiles. For the first time I feel the real sadness behind that smile. She isn’t faking being happy. She nods. I head to the office. She is following.

I sit down and pat a spot on the couch next to me. She sits down. She is looking down. I sigh. “Going to look at me?”

She shakes her head vigorously. “I… I can’t, Ms. Wallace. If I do I will be worthless today.” She chockes a sob.

I send the WhatsApp message I had waiting. I get an immediate response. Grey is 2 minutes out. They were expecting this and had come in to help, just in case. And with that all my worries about Grey get drop kicked out a door. She’s made the Mayday list. John’s lucky.

“Look at me, dear Mona.”

She looks up and the dam holding back her pain breaks. She starts having huge sobs and clutches me like a drowning person grabbing a lifeguard. I pat her back. After a couple of minutes Grey knocks lightly, opens the door, looks sad, says “I got this, you get her,” and closes the door.

Mona looks at the door and starts almost wailing.

I hold her for a bit. Tissue is heaped up after a little while. Finally, she looks at me in a mostly calm manner. “I am so sorry. I don’t know why I am crying like this when I am so fucking happy right now. Even this is just making me happier and sad and I don’t know what to do.”

I squeeze her hand. “First you will talk. Then you will look at a list of counselors and call one. Then you are going to schedule some time to figure out your emotions. After that, you will start the process of healing.”

I don’t tell her I already got Doc Peters to reserve a spot for her in a few hours. Let’s see if she picks her. I hope she does.

She looks up at me with those gorgeous deep green eyes and all I see is admiration. “How are you so good? I have heard bits and pieces from people. You are like me. I, well, I turned things around and became the abuser. Became this. I never had anyone love me. No real friends, no family. Just people to use and be used by. And you come here and make a life of helping people. Even a worthless abuser like me.” She starts crying and grabs hold of me. The hug changes and now she is being rocked by me. This poor girl. She IS happy and it is fucking with her because she has had who knows how long of abuse and abusing to bury her ability to feel it properly. I take a risk.

“First, you are going to need to tell me three nice things about yourself. Then we are going to look at that list.”

She looks annoyed but still thinks for a few seconds. “I do my best, I know restraint, I recognize excellence.” Interesting series of compliments. Yea, she is going to need the Doc.

She scans the list. “I think I have a preference. I am betting you do. Who do you recommend Ms. Wallace?”

“I recommend the third name. I go to her. She knows about the Fae and such. I have been going to her for months. She’s helped me a lot.”

I get puppy dog eyes from her. “She really respects you. I met her at the wedding. I know she will be good.”

I totally forgot about that. “Oh yea. Well, she is amazing.”

“I still can’t get over you going to therapy…”

I laugh. “Girl, I don’t got issues, I got volumes. Yes. I finally came to accept myself when I realized a lot of my former notions were off. When I could finally be in love with Jackie I knew I needed to make myself better. Not just for her. For me. Part of that realization was through therapy. And I can tell you that I had at least one session focused on what a monster I was for bashing in a demon’s head not out of being protective but out of jealousy and rage. You were being bad. And you have been forgiven already for it, by the way. But you did something and my response was mostly a blind rage at you touching what the dark voice in me said was mine. I was jealous you got to do that while I couldn’t think of a way to ask for it. I was angry you got to do it first. Jealous of your assertiveness. Turns out she was thinking the same when it came to some people. I owe you an apolo…”

I never finish the word. She throws herself into a hug so fierce I am afraid I may pass out.

“Ms. Wallace, you never need to apologize for that. I deserved it and more. It also led to this moment. I realized Lemar was bothered by something yesterday. I also realized I gave a fuck about it. Like a lot, actually. My friend was worried about the…”

She stops. His family was in possible danger at the time. Wait. This isn’t about that. She looks guilty as fuck.

“About what?”

She shakes her head.

I nod. “I won’t press. The fact that you are trying to keep his confidence and not using it as a ploy to get favor or tease me speaks volumes. I think you are ready for that therapy. Make some calls, get things scheduled. Take your time. But try to get in today if you can. See if the person will have you as a patient. Grey is already here to cover your shift.”

She almost starts crying again. “I need to send a schedule change too so you can delete my punch in.”

I chuckle. “Nope. You make all your calls and get everything ready. You are on the clock the entire time. If you can manage to work some, great. If it would be too much, it is fine. I will punch you out at shift end. I am not so shitty a boss as that.”

“I am… great. Gonna be another 10 or fif…teen minutes to stop crying.”

“Take things as slow as you need, Mona.”

“It’s Desdemona. Desdemona Eleni Giannopoulou. Only child of Giannis, of Aigai”

I stare at this creature. Why? *Why would she do that? I can control her if I want now… oh Mona.*

She smiles at me and sighs. “I have wanted to tell you that for weeks now. That and you make me happy. Being here is happiness. Being with my family is happiness. Thank you. Thank you for giving me a second chance and giving me a place to call home. I trust you.” She leans forward and kisses me on the cheek. “You are amazing. I love you.”

“Sweet girl, I could say the same to you.” I do love her. She is sweet and kind. I am NOT dating her. Corporate rules.

Wait. Why did I use that excuse? *Oh Bob dammit Jackie. You turned me into a polyam demisexual. I love you, you evil bitch.*

I can feel her snicker from here.

*“Serves you right for making me bi. Also, about time you realized you had a harem…”*

*OH FUCK RIGHT OFF!*

*“We need to make you the protagonist in some tournament focused Shonen. Maybe having you make coffee competitively. Oh!!! We can name it Faire Grounds!!!”*

*What the ever living fuck Jackie? That is so fucking random and I love it and now you need to make a business plan on a manga….* I smile. Heh

I got the desired result. “*Aw, fuck me and my big damn mouth. More work!”*

We here a knock on the door. I check Mona, she nods. “Come in.”

Connie peeks in. She looks at Mona and runs in to hold her. Mona starts sobbing again. Connie starts making soothing noises and stroking her friends hair and cheek. This demon has a lot of people that love her. I hope she can handle it soon.

 

# Jan 04, 2025: Desdemona Eleni Giannopoulou

*Incubus*

 I am in a waiting room. I picked a modest outfit for work because, well, I felt weird. Thing is, even my modest outfits are sort of sexy. I feel wrong looking frumpy. Just can’t manage it and here I am looking sexy and still a mess. Ugh. The receptionist stares at me. She has beautiful hazel eyes, a shy smile, and a pain submission kink. Girl would have me grind my heel into her hand and thank me for it.

Sometimes being able to tell what a mortal’s darkest fantasy is with a glance in a sort of vision is a curse. I can’t play with this lovely thing. I am here to get better. Not find a new client or plaything.

She calls my name and I walk into a very comfortable looking office. The doctor is a dirty blonde with glasses and her hair in a ponytail. She looks as lovely as when I saw her at the wedding, somehow. She smiles and shakes my hand while leading me to the couch. She has a notepad and pulls out a pen as I sit down.

“Now then, Mona, why are you here?”  Cutting to the chase. I like it.

“I think for the first time in a very long time I felt happiness. I felt like I have a home and family and people I love. I kept sobbing when I realized it.”

“So your response to being happy was tears and sobbing?” She is writing it down. The question isn’t judgy. It is a matter of fact and clarifying voice. I am way more at ease.

“Yes. So my boss referred me to you. We have met before. I don’t know if you remember…”

“Mona, there is nothing short of full amnesia that could make that interaction forgettable.”

I recall more of the details. OH! Whoops. THAT Bathroom kink moment… Yikes. I better get back to the subject. “So I figured it was okay. Um… how secure is all this? Can I talk freely without worry that someone will know?”

She nods. “These books are in my own shorthand. They are locked in here. I don’t discuss other clients but I will say I have seen some… extraordinary ones. You can be reassured that I won’t divulge secrets.”

I nod. “It has been close to 3 millennia that I have lived as I am now. I have never known love. Lust, certainly. But never real love and kindness and tenderness. Aside from a single gentle and sweet mortal, all I have been is a fucktoy to them.  I was shown so much this week. Hell, since I joined the CaFae it has been kindness from everyone. Kindness I don’t deserve. My old life didn’t even have close…”

“Lot to unpack here. Especially 3 millennia and that old life comment. I didn’t realize you are that old. You are what again? I forgot if you ever mentioned it. I know it is something infernal…”

Nice, Doc. Well, she didn’t see all of me last time. May as well give her a good show. I stand up and realize I will need to strip a bit. I drop the top and skirt. She gawks, the underwear is sexy, I mean, I don’t have anything that isn’t. I then drop the guise of a human. My wings get stretched out a bit from their hip anchor joints, the horns grow in and my skin tone changes to the normal red ash color. She stares. I swish my tail back and forth for the full effect. My tattoo glows brightly. She is licking her lips… and in that moment I see that fantasy of hers again. Same as Jackie’s. Kinky Doctor wants someone to take her like that. Hardcore kink. Not one I intend to help her with. I had it done enough to me as a mortal.

I change back.

“Succubus is a new one.” She is back to business.

“I am an incubus, actually.”

“What is the difference?” She is scribbling something down.

“An incubus is a dominant person in the matters of sex. We control the other. Tops, so to speak. A succubus is a submissive demon. They are bottoms by nature.”

“Is there a term for one that switches?”  She is making notes, very professional, and also helps her I bet.

I nod. “Weirdly enough, concubus. Concubi is the plural. So what now?”

She laughs. “Now you put the clothes back on and I hate Pat for bringing such a dangerous individual for my professionalism into my office. I also give you the help you need in processing this. Have you ever thought you didn’t deserve love?” She smiles

I nod. “I don’t.”

“Yea, that’s what I thought. You need to stop that line of thinking. We are going to work on that along with unpacking what happened to you before you became a sex fiend, literally.”

I tilt my head. “How long have you been waiting to use that line?”

“Since the wedding. Been coming up with great puns since I had an adorable mermaid talk to me about stuff I can’t go into. After that a bunch of the Fae started showing up and I got to use some of them. Met you and found out a demon is a real thing and I hoped you would show up. I could see you were troubled. I think I can help you.”

“I would love that. I want to be able to smile at my friends and family all the time without it being fake or breaking into uncontrollable sobbing.”

 

# Jan 04, 2025: Lemar Rogers

*Enlightened Human*

“You called for me boss?” I am sure Grey was scheduled for tomorrow. Mona is supposed to be here… What did Pat do?

She smiles and I am immediately on alert. She is being too sweet about it.

“Coffee? Tea?”  She looks at me. Oh no, queen boss lady, I am on to your tricks. Only one thing it could be here. I don’t think she’d rat me out. Let me check.

“What did Mona say?” I brace myself.

“She didn’t. She started to tell me about her friend, you, being worried and how it hurt her and she couldn’t handle it and you were worried about… something. Now, being who I am, I can’t let that go, can I?”

I sigh. “How much did you dig up?”

She winks. “Sit down, soon to be fellow owner.”

FUUUUUUUUCK. Well, better end this quick.

“I turned them down.”

She stares at me. “Why?”

“May is home here. Not just in NYC. Here. This place. And our place. This community is home. And Celeste is cared for. That franchise location is hours away, a new place with people that aren’t friends. That aren’t family. She and I discussed it. She told me to do it. I saw how torn she was. That cemented it for me. My wife was willing to hurt herself and her life for me. I made a vow never to make her.”

I shake my head, “Then there was Mona balling because she thought I was in pain. Now here I am with you, you checked as soon as you thought I might have a problem. I knew you would. It would be like you losing family. Not going to hurt my ladies. All of them.” I get up, pull her up by the hand, and give her a hug. “I should have done this years ago. Thank you, Pat. For everything. You are family. Love ya. Just don’t get weird about it. You aren’t collecting me and May along with every other Fae, Angel, Devil, and Demon around.”

She laughs. “I love you. You are also a moron.”

I look at her. “Why?”

“You so could have said they offered you some stupid amount of money and I would have had incentive to match it to keep you.”

“Oh… um… so they offered me…?”

“They did? How much?” Her smile tells me she isn’t taking no.

“Um…” crap, I wasn’t ready for this… I should not get greedy.

“It must be a lot if you can’t pull a number out. Look, I will counter their offer with a raise. How does 50% sound?”

I look at this beautiful woman that has never realized how pretty she actually is and laugh. She got me again. She always surprises me.

“Done. Shake on it?”

We shake hands. I smile. “I would have settled for 25’%.” Ha. Got you.

She doesn’t miss a beat. “I would have gone up to 100%.” Oh. Got me…

Dammit!

# Jan 04, 2025: The Eminence of Fury.

*Werewolf*

I am given an envelope by Nixie. She bows and leaves without a single word. Must be in a rush.

Within it is information on the results of my attacks are inside. So far all the attacks after the initial vampire culling have failed.

The Necromancer went to the Fairies and is in their world, where we can’t follow.

The annoying vampire is back. Though he is the last of his kind in the city. I killed all the others without much of a fuss.

The troll will be difficult. I have a plan for him. Get him when he has to defend his woman. The Orion pack should be able to kill him. Seven strong, with a good mix of strengths. He’s a troll, not much else. We can simply eat him until he stops moving.

Now come potential targets and the issues there.

The two witches are an unknown. I know they started human. But now, they are not right. Hmmmm. I need to face them myself. That will come. First, we remove their support network. Maybe I will have some of my people follow the employees. Should be able to remove pawns that way.

I do need to deal with that one guy. Laoch? The hunter with him isn’t an issue. He does want to meet. I will kill this Laoch then.

On second thought, I have a pack that knows where they are. Let’s see if the Hunter and his ancient client can fight them in their sleep…

 

# Jan 04, 2025: Raymond

*Enlightened Human*

I hear the creaking and wake up. My client has his hand up to shake me awake. In his other hand are some papers from that packet. Guess he was going to read it in some downtime. I look and nod. I pull out the silver knife that is below my pillow from the sheath and wait. I don’t have to wait long.

The werewolf in moon form jumps in. Screwballs name their form things like moon, war, and homid. All it means is dog, Hollywood movie werewolf, and a human. But no, they have to call it weird things to be edgy. Fucking snowflakes.

The moon form goes to bite on my neck when it gets a throat full of silver Bowie knife. 8 inches, honest, of silver plated onto a steel blade. The edge is only okay. But the result is an instant allergic reaction as his body rips itself to shreds on the cut. The wolf’s head starts to swell and it almost screams before choking on its own blood. Normally they barely bleed. But this baby leaves permanent damage. Here it just kills the damn dog.

A war form follows. I pull out and throw the knife. It has my reach beat by a foot even with the blade so this works better. The knife sticks into it’s abdomen. It howls in pain and tries to pull the blade out. I jump off the bed and kick the knife in further. I get sideswiped for my trouble. I slam into the wall in a heap. It worked though. The fight is out of the enemy as it tries to pull the blade out while in agony. Good.

My client has another war form swiping at him. Damn Fae are annoying. He is just bobbing and weaving. He looks over to check on me. I point to my belt. He nods and moves towards it as if this was no big deal.

The creature is getting frustrated until he pulls the belt off my pants. Using it as a flail, the client swings it around and the silver belt buckle finds its mark on the creature’s snout. It howls in pain and frustration. Then the belt starts acting like some strange whip weapon. I see it flash a dozen times in less than 5 seconds. The wolf’s face is shredded. It staggers and he brings my belt buckle hard enough on its head to leave a crunch noise. 2 more of them show up, only now I have grabbed my bandolier of throwing knives. Half are silver. I launch 2 at the nearest. It doesn’t even make a noise as it drops dead, one of the knives went through the eyeball into his brain. The last one tries to bite the client. He backflips to where the wolf with the stomach full of silver is whimpering. He pulls the knife out, by dragging it up through its sternum. The creature falls down. I don’t know if it is dead yet. Won’t matter.

The last wolf gets within a foot of him when the knife he just yanked out of its friend is shoved through its skull at the temple. It drops like a puppet with the strings cut. I whistle. I wish I had him in my old days.

“What now, boss?”

My client looks annoyed. “Now we go visit his Eminence. Now I am annoyed.”

 

# Jan 04, 2025: Todd, The Fox of Yorkshire

*Troll*

“Well well, a bunch of big strong Loup Garou decide to attack a couple on a date. Should I be impressed?”

The lead wolf moves forward. “You brought this on yourself, troll, when you interfered in our blood hunt on the parasite.” Their taunts just make me laugh.

“Parasite? Ha! The only parasites I have seen in the last week are the fleas all of you have. You know there’s a shampoo for that. If you are worried they have them in a no tears variety so it won’t make you cry any more than you already do...” That’s how you taunt, bitch.

The large wolf at my left lunges for Beth, its mouth snaps down on my arm as I whip it out to block for her. I am not letting anyone touch her. The wolf thrashes and then yelps as an ear is ripped off its head by me. It jumps back and begins howling in pain. The ear starts regrowing. My arm already healed up. They have regen near on par with mine. This will be messy. Fine, you wanna be monsters? Face a real one. I drop my mask. A troll that is far more menacing than any of their pack is before them. Several step back, they apparently didn’t know what I actually am.

“The human is not involved. Keep her out of this.” I am sure my eyes glow yellow right now. I have been told I am terrifying when I want to be.

Their laughter is devoid of any mercy. “And lose our best way to weaken you? No, you are going to hear her screams for mercy for hours, little troll.” I glance at the leader. He has stripped and is standing before me naked. I point and laugh.

“I am not the little one here. I know it is  cold, but why is that smaller than my girlfriend’s pinky?”

The taunt works and the leader jumps forward with his knife in hand. I catch his wrist and lift him up. Grabbing his arm between the shoulder and elbow and I begin applying pressure and I am rewarded with the snaps of the bones between. I rip off the useless arm off of him and hit him across the face with it. He screams. A lot. “Quit hitting yourself.” The leader howls in pain and rage and then I toss him into the group. Only a single moon form still in our way to the apartment and I make a call. “Get to the apartment building!” I slam the moon form into a wall. It snarls and snaps at me, but I pin it there and we both begin biting each other. I hear Beth running at full speed.

It turns into a scrum as I grapple with several creatures. One bites down on my shoulder, I can’t stop the grunt of pain. I do head butt the creature. I make a break for it. I don’t get far as their numbers finally allow them to bring me down. Shit, one went after her!! I get back up as I rip and tear them. I have to save her. Suddenly half my vision goes and I feel real pain for the first time in ages. Oh, he ate my eyeball. Damn, I hope it grows back the same color. Beth likes my eye color.

If I lose here I may not be me again. If they damage my brain too much I may forget her. I can’t forget her. I wasn’t the same me the last time I woke up from some horrible damage 50 years ago. I finally found out why that happened and now I am in danger of having it happen again. She may lose me, and I won’t even know. FUCK!! I am so sorry love. 

Everything is going dark. Dammit!!

 

# Jan 04, 2025: Elizabeth

*Human*

I am in a full sprint heading to the apartment when I see a small group of women. I can’t tell who they are but I bet these werewolves don’t want all of New York knowing they exist so this may work.

“HELP! THEY JUMPED MY BOYFRIEND!!” The women turn and a familiar halo of red hair comes into view as one of them speaks, “Beth?!”

As I am getting closer I hear one of the pursuers approaching fast. I keep running and then I see Jackie’s eyes grow huge. Jackie calls out, “Get down!”

You know I feel like a warning like this is probably critical. I drop and pray I survive doing so. I glance up and see the moon form werewolf as Todd calls them is above me mouth open as it is pouncing. Oh God! It screams when it is hit with a ball of flames. The smell of burnt hair hits me at about the same moment as the further screams of pain do.

“You are not hurting a hair on her head!” Jackie rushes forward. The attacker is screaming in pain again as it is immolating. It is healing fast, but no amount of healing helps second degree burns not hurt. And the flames simply seem to be feeding off the regenerating tissue. I don’t think this thing is going to live through this. Wow, Jackie…

Pat grabs me and pulls me up. “Where is lil bro?” Pat looks terrified. She knows I wouldn’t leave him without good reason. I point. I see a blur fly by me. Pat runs. No wait. She flies? I still try to follow her. Cindy grabs me. Connie turns into her dangerous looking tree form and she makes a spear out of one arm while a shield is on the other. She faces the street and is physically blocking anything from getting to us.

“Let me go, I HAVE to go to him! I can’t leave him!”

She grabs me and pulls me close. “He only wants to keep you safe. Right now he is in danger but he doesn’t care because you are safe.”

Connie adds to her argument. “You probably didn’t realize that blur was Anton. He saw you were safe and immediately went to help Todd. Anton won’t let him die.” 

Cindy finally pushes me enough to get me to listen. “If you run back into danger, they will worry. Those two will help him. I know my ladies. They would never let their little bro down.”

Ricardo is with Connie. “You see that?”

She nods. “It was my lady. She launched a werewolf into the air and then sent it to the ground. She is at his side.”

I can’t help myself. “Is he okay?”

She shakes her head. “I can’t tell, Beth. Oh. Here they come. Oh no…”

 

# Jan 04, 2025: Todd, King of Meals

*Werewolf Chow*

My world is pain. So many chunks missing. I know I lost a leg and they are working on my entrails. They are making me suffer. Soon they will get to my heart. My one remaining hand holds a silver ring. I could use it as a weapon. It might save me. But it would sully the gift I meant to use to ask her tonight while on my knee in front of Nee-Chan and the others. I wish things were different.

A howl. Another. Screams and noises of confusion. What is going on? I open my remaining eye and look around.

Anton?! But they want him dead more than me. Gods above, they are tearing him to pieces. He doesn’t even seem to react. He’s pushing my heart back into my body and forcing it to work. Wait? They tore out my heart? Assholes.

He finally starts fighting back once my heart starts working again. But they have hurt him so much. Because he is trying to save me. He is trying to defend me so I can regenerate. Oh no. The poor guy is going to die if he keeps trying to save me. Dammit.

“None of you will have him, his love needs him!” I watch one tear his arm to shreds as he tried to keep it off me. He grunts but doesn’t stop trying to pull it off even as he gets disemboweled.

Dude is a pretty stand up guy. I hope he survives.

Then the howls of triumph turn to ones of pain.

I see Pat. 

My Queen is here. Nee-chan came to save me. Of course she did. That means Beth is safe. Good. Oh, Nee-chan, she is in her full majesty. And she is on the street. So much danger of being discovered. She gives zero fucks. A war wolf lunges at her and she absolutely launches him into the air with a punch. Her wings spread and she flies up after him. She uses his skull like a volleyball and spikes the wolf into the ground with a very sickening crunch and then lands on him. “Still a monster at volleyball! You should all run now.”  They move, but not to run. Idiots. I don’t see where all of them are. It won’t matter.

She turns and looks at me. “Todd? Oh my Bob.”

She snatches me up and holds me gently. If I have to die, this is a good way to do it. “You need to get better, let’s get you home.” The wolves have her surrounded.

Their leader laughs, “You really think you can just walk out of here with them alone?”

She laughs in a much scarier way. Uh-oh, the Devil voice is in charge.

“You face the Evergreen Queen. You have two choices, leave, or suffer and then die.”

“7 of us, 1 of you. The troll and leech are in no shape to fight.”

“Two of us, and just one of us outmatches all of you.”

“You really think you are that powerful, bitch? Please. You still can’t count. Neither of them will count in a fight and you aren’t going to beat us.”

“I know I am that much more powerful than all of you. More importantly, I wasn’t talking about me or him when I said one of us was more than a match for you.” I see her look at the direction of our home. “What took you so long, lover?” I know who she means. They will burn so horribly…  I almost laugh. It comes out a gurgle of blood. I hear Pat’s Breath catch.

Jackie steps out of a shadow and looks at the six wolves. “Your math is off, boyo. There are 6 of you.”

The leader looks at her. “My pack is seven.”

“Was seven. Now six.” She drops a charred skull of a wolf on the ground. It looks like the bone carbonized. Wow. She isn’t playing around. Yea, I wouldn’t survive her wrath. Glad I never found out.

A moon form wolf snarls and begins charging her. It never even gets to scream. The entire body is surrounded in white hot flames and in less than 5 seconds a smoldering pile of bones hits the floor. Those begins cracking and shattering.

“Five.”

The rest stare at her in terror.

Another eruption.

“Four.”

The remaining four launch themselves at her. Fight or flight is a funny thing. They should have picked flight…  She begins laughing.

The closest to her sees her change into a being of fire with molten brass for skin. He realizes too late why his mistake means he will die as he grabs her. He erupts in flame. All his hairs catching fire. He screams as he backs away. He continues to burn and scream. I don’t see the rest of the fight as I feel myself taken aloft. I am being flown to the apartments.

We land in the front courtyard. Pat looks at what’s left of me. I feel so sorry I am not sure even my legendary regeneration can save me. They hurt me so much. I try to gurgle an apology. I wish I could see Beth one last time before I go. I hear her screaming and Cindy is holding her back. Guess even a troll can die…

“Your queen commands you to heal and be well.” I wish I could do so but the damage is too much, Nee-chan. It is over for…

Wait.

My other arm is back, my legs are feeling like legs again, the wracking pain in my stomach is gone. My body is all here. I look around and see Beth with both my eyes.

Then I get it. She made me heal. My eyes full of tears, I look at Pat.

She smiles, her kind, sweet smile, “You protected me once while I was unconscious in a hospital. It cost you dearly. A 35-year coin, if I recall. You may not have considered me in your debt, but I did. We are even, little bro.”

I hear a few people talking. Jackie is back already. She has Anton with her. He looks more terrified than happy that she is helping him walk. Yea, he’s afraid of fire, I get it. She has Connie help him. Hahaha, poor guy, want to get burned or staked?

“I would feel bad, but they weren’t going to stop. And I can’t let Pat get all the big sis street cred.”  I laugh. She gets so much cred. I am frankly terrified of what she can do.

I look at Beth. I stand up and look at what’s left of my bloody clothes. Doesn’t matter. “I wanted this to be special. I wanted everyone there while I pulled this out and then did this.” With some struggle I get on a knee. I show Beth the ring. She is crying.

“Beth, you have been the greatest thing to come into my life. Would you marry me?”

Beth nods her head and grabs me. “I don’t want to ever leave you again!”

Jackie smacks Pat on the arm. “THAT is how you propose. Not handing a woman some sausage at breakfast along with a ring.”

“Bitch, please. The first morning you moved in with me and I made you breakfast you said all I needed was a ring to get you to marry me.”

“I did, didn’t I? Funny thing, I meant it even back then.” Jackie is literally glowing

“God you are such a dork.” Pat smiles.

“One you are in love with!”

“Quit ruining their moment.”

Beth grabs them both in a hug. “You brought him back to me. You get to be weird. You are also both bridesmaids.”

I laugh. “Nope. Nee-Chan is the best man.”

“I am not turning into a guy for the wedding.”

I laugh. “You will look amazing in a tux just as you are, sis.”

“No tails, I want to show off this perfect ass.”

“No tails.” I nod. “You can show off that near-perfect ass.”

The look she gives me is hilarious. The pain was worth it. I get to come home to this family.

 

# Jan 04, 2025: The Warrior

*Tuatha De Danaan*

“You really think you can defeat me? I have THE Spear of Lugh. None can defeat me. I am the greatest warrior living.” The war form wolf in front of me has  black hair and a black cloak that wave with an unseen wind. He snarls and gestures. Did he really procure some enchantment to make his cape billow with wind in a building?!

I shrug. “You mistake my offer to take that cursed thing from you before it ends up destroying your people as weakness. Please think this through. How many of your pack are dead?”

He snarls. “3.”

I nod. “How many other packs have you sent to their doom so far?”

“They were weak. They could not destroy a human and a troll. Hardly worth my time to consider them as more than worthless.”

“So just the one? Or have you lost more?” I know the answer. Another group assaulted my Hunter and I. They are no longer alive. He knows it too. The Hunter had a surprising amount of silver on him and was well versed in killing their kind.

He squints at me. “And the pack you destroyed, along with another that appears to have vanished.”

A form steps out from the shadows next to a pack member that is completely surprised by his emergence. “Sorry, the King of Beasts told me to convey a message after he dealt with them.”

“Who the fuck are you?!” The werewolf leader is snarling at the Sidhe that appeared.

He bows. “Ah, where are my manners. I am Robin Goodfellow. You may call me Puck.”

Several werewolves back away from him as if set on fire.

“The message is, and I quote him, ‘Do you have any more snacks? Those were tasty.’ And I believe he meant all of that.”

I laugh. The leader spins and growls at me. Spear or not, I am not worried.

“Leave or suffer.”

I shrug. “No. I wish the Spear returned. You will return it now or the consequences for you and your kin will be tragic. I am willing to compensate you for it. Believe me, this is a blessing.”

“We shall see.” The creature moves with a speed that would be surprising to a mortal. The spear is used as if it is a short sword by him. He attempts to stab me at short range. I slide to the side by a single pace and he misses. He then reverses and attempts a very clumsy attempt to hit me with the haft. I bend backwards and then use my momentum to perform a backflip which allows me to escape the spear as it is used in a swipe at my legs. 

The look of shock is evident on his face. He attempts a few spear thrusts. I dodge or parry them all. I smile. He continues lunging and swiping with the spear as if it was a clumsy thing. The enchantment on the weapon means any strikes I would perform on him would not do much. I am well aware of what it would take to actually kill him while he held it. I am not willing to do so. But I can show him that while he cannot be defeated, a draw is absolutely possible.

“Why won’t you attack, old man, afraid?!”

I laugh. “That would require me to consider you a worthy opponent. You wield that weapon with the skill of a toddler. There’s no glory found in defeating a worthless opponent. Besides, I do not have to win. I merely must not lose. And you are not even close to defeating me.”

His rage is evident. I back away and continue taunting him. The Hunter has secured an escape route, and I have explained the situation. This is enough. I nod to Puck, who steps back into the shadows and vanishes.

“Please do keep my offer in mind. Your forces may be completely destroyed and you will remain unbeatable. You will suffer misfortune after misfortune and still remain unbeaten. Will it be worth it to you to see your world burned to ashes for a victory you cannot enjoy? Oh and I would stop attacking the Sidhe. Sooner or later you will bite off more than that big mouth of yours can chew and Oberon may get more snacks.” I step through the doorway and make my way out.

I have recently moved into my own place and my living room currently has the exact “just moved in yesterday… six weeks ago” aesthetic. It’s basically a grey couch, a wooden coffee table, wooden floors (slide 1) and the crushing awareness that I am now responsible for making this space look like an adult lives here.

So I decided the first step toward adulthood is a rug. Naturally, instead of picking one like a normal person, I spiralled and ended up with a long list of 17 options from Ruggable. Please don’t judge me, or do, but also help.

I’m 30-ish, want the room to feel warm and cozy, but also like I’ve vaguely got my life together. Eventually I’ll add more stuff (art, plants, maybe personality), but for now I need a rug that won’t make future-me say “why did you do that?”

Which one would you pick for this space? Bonus points if you roast my current minimalist hostage-situation setup.

1p8tym5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1p8tym5/supplements_that_actually_work/,Supplements that actually work,"Beginners who get into lifting think supplements are like some kind of magic. Truth is, only a few actually do anything and most are just scam. Here is no bullshit list , ill try to keep it short:

# Whey Protein

It’s just protein. It's a simple and quick way to get an extra 20-30g(1 scoop) of protein but don’t feel like eating more. Not necessary if you get enough from food and won’t make you bulk or cut on its own , it just helps your muscles recover and grow when combined with training.

# Creatine Monohydrate

Most studied supplement ever. It basically lets you push harder, lift heavier and do more reps for short period of time. Safe for healthy adults and you don't need a loading phase, , just take 5g daily(timing doesn't matter) and don't think about it. More work = more muscle over time , not magic.

# Caffeine

No brainer. It's CNS stimulant that gives a short term boost in focus, energy, and performance. 100-300mg 30 minutes before workout ,usually one cup of coffee usually does the job. Just be careful with timing it can stay in your system 4-6 hours and late intake can mess up your sleep. Also caffeine doesn’t actually stop fatigue , just tricks your brain by blocking adenosine, the chemical that makes you feel tired.

# Beta Alanine

It's included in most preworkouts. Basically delays fatigue so you can last longer before your muscles start burning. Take 3.2-6.4g daily (again doesn’t matter when , just like creatine it's effects come from building up). You may feel itching which is normal and goes away , but to prevent it you can split the doses e.g 3.2g before workout, 3.2g with a meal.

# Omega 3(EPA/DHA)

It won’t give you a boost in the gym directly, but it’s essential for long term recovery, lowering muscle soreness and overall joint health. So if you are not a fish person like me and eat fish once per 2 months ,consider getting around 1-2g of EPA+DHA daily.

# Vitamin D

If you live in a place with little sunlight or spend most of your time indoors you most likely have deficit. It’s essential for bone health, mood, and supporting your immune system. 1000-2000 IU daily is a safe bet. People think it's only for winter months , but you can still be low in summer , especially if you're indoors a lot or wear sunscreen.

None of these are magic. They only help on top of solid diet, good training, quality sleep , if your foundation isn't there , they won't do much except empty your pocket.

My main priorities at the moment are:

* daily movement (10k steps, yoga, etc.)
* gym 3-5 times a week (starting with 3 and working my way up to 4 or 5 days a week)
* eating less to lose weight (and eating more nutritional foods for my skin and hair as well as general health) - I'm aiming for approximately 1500 calories or less daily to go from 175lbs to 135lbs over time.

I haven't done any of the above in about a month now because I've been sick but I feel better now and want to get back into it.

I'd also like to look after my mental health more by:

* spending more time on hobbies and self-care (I love reading and playing guitar, but I don't get the time to because I doomscroll which I'm cutting out)
* spending more time on my career (I'm a uni student but spending more time with my job at a coffee shop than my studies which makes me feel very stressed and anxious - so I want to focus more on that)
* being more financially conscious (no more buying crap on a whim, need to build savings)

I'd really like someone to do this with because I quickly end up in a slump a lot of the time and give up. I'm in my 20s now and I don't want to spend my mid 20s, early 30s in the same spot.

I play at max brightness and this area seems to lack a proper black color to make use of the OLED displays. Instead, it's a washed out gray color, which is perhaps the perfect mura use case. I figured if there's a place it would be super obvious it would be this one.

Got my PSVR2 (first VR headset ever) a few days ago and am slowly getting used to it. At first, I looked at the PS5 menu and I thought that my lenses were greasy from some production oils or worse - they were used before. Everything looked super ""greasy"", like I'm looking at an ultramatte coating on a monitor on a bright white image. I scrubbed 5 times with a microfiber cloth, but nothing improved. I researched and turns out this is mura and it's normal for OLEDs. But I have had dozens of AMOLED phones, two QD-OLED TVs and a Tandem OLED iPad and I've never seen that before. Some people swear they haven't seen it, others say it varies from panel to panel. All I want, really, is to just know if what I'm seeing is within the normal range before my return window closes.

I have some other newbie questions, if someone had some spare time to clarify some things for me:

- Got Beat Saber, really enjoyed it, played 4 songs and by the end I was seeing sweat droplets pouring in front of my eyes. Immediately stopped, the whole viewfinder was soaked. I dried it out with a soft microfiber cloth and let it air out. Do I risk damaging it like that? I tend to sweat a lot.

- The visor can be adjusted back and forth, but should I pull it forward before putting the headset on? Last time I didn't (it was in the place I'd have it while in use) and I put the set, fiddling with just the rear headband. Wanted to retract the visor but it got stuck and ultimately required a lot of force until ""unclicked"".

- Should this visor be touching my eyebrows? I heard it should be pushed as closely to the face as possible. However, when I do that, I think my eyelashes start hitting the lenses and I start smearing them over time.

- It was very tough to figure out that the headset should sit a lot higher than I expected, with the rear headband almost touching my neck. It requires a lot of twists on the knob to secure it like this, but it almost feels unnatural. I can feel pressure building in my eyebrows as the headset has to sit there for the sweet spot. It's noy painful by any means, but it just feels weird that the point of contact is on my eyebrows. It also seems to slip a bit over time, so I have to constantly turn the knob one clockwise turn to constantly tighten it. I almost feel like it would break from overtightening sometimes.

- I have a roughly 1.20m by 2.0m playing area when I put away my 80cm round coffee table from in front of my U-shaped couch. However, when I set up my play area it always warns me that it's less than 1m by 1m even though it's marked the whole place, floor included, perfectly. It makes no sense. The real issue lies in that whatever I do, I always get my controllers marked in red because I'm apparently going out of my play area. It's very annoying to have things constantly flashing red on me. Am I doing something wrong?

- Is it possible to play seated on a deep couch? I've yet to receive my PC adapter to try it with my PC on a chair, but with my PS5 on the living room sofa, I often have to take things out of my ""pockets"" (RE4 and Hitman, for example) and I just can't reach them as I can't reach through the seat I'm sitting on.

- Is there a way to check how much fps is a game running on? I'd very much like to use 120 fps on my PS5 Pro whenever possible, to avoid dizziness as much as possible, but I can't figure out how to check that. On my Samsung TV I just open the game bar, but not sure how to do it here.",0,1764333016.0,PSVR,2,0.5,False

Tired of seeing the same 5 prompts recycled? Frustrated by endless swiping for minimal payoff? Are you secretly convinced that your dating app profile is only being seen by bots and people who live 5,000 miles away? You are not alone!

We want to hear about your genuine experiences, core frustrations, and secret wishlist for what a good online dating platform should look like.

The Ask

Who: Anyone 18 years or older who has used an online dating app/service (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Match, Coffee Meets Bagel, Grindr, etc.) in the past or present.

What: A survey on your user experience, biggest pet peeves, and preferences in the digital dating landscape.

Time Commitment: Seriously, it's quick. Think 4-7 minutes. That's less time than it takes to curate the perfect selfie or figure out if that person is holding a fish or their actual date in their profile picture. We respect your time! 🤝

Purpose: Academic/personal research project aimed at understanding the emotional and functional friction points in online dating to hopefully inspire better solutions (or at least provide some excellent commiseration material).

🎯 **Clean UI** \- Just the info you need. No clutter, no distractions. I designed it like I'd want to use it every day.

⚡ **Fast** \- Doesn't slow down your browser or break page layouts :D

📊 **Complete info** \- Font family, size, weight, line height, letter spacing, color codes (HEX/RGB/HSL) & more

🆓 **100% Free** \- No premium tiers, no subscriptions.

I built this because I was frustrated. If you've ever rage-uninstalled a font finder, this is for you.

(18+, Online Dating Users)","We're running a quick, low-pain, high-reward survey designed to figure out if we're all just collectively losing our minds on dating apps, or if there's a pattern to the madness.
Tired of seeing the same 5 prompts recycled? Frustrated by endless swiping for minimal payoff? Are you secretly convinced that your dating app profile is only being seen by bots and people who live 5,000 miles away? You are not alone!

We want to hear about your genuine experiences, core frustrations, and secret wishlist for what a good online dating platform should look like.

The Ask

Who: Anyone 18 years or older who has used an online dating app/service (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Match, Coffee Meets Bagel, Grindr, etc.) in the past or present.

What: A survey on your user experience, biggest pet peeves, and preferences in the digital dating landscape.

Time Commitment: Seriously, it's quick. Think 4-7 minutes. That's less time than it takes to curate the perfect selfie or figure out if that person is holding a fish or their actual date in their profile picture. We respect your time! 🤝

Purpose: Academic/personal research project aimed at understanding the emotional and functional friction points in online dating to hopefully inspire better solutions (or at least provide some excellent commiseration material).

1p8tlmq,https://v.redd.it/32cqx0j8rz3g1,Espresso introduction at home - Delonghi Stilosa,"Hi everyone, here's a taste of what has been my pleasant introduction to the world of espresso at home.

The coffee is the house blend from Torra (Portugal🇵🇹), which I consider to be a medium/light roast. I'm using the machine's original baskets but without the pressurization part; this model allows you to depressurize the baskets relatively easily. Of course, it's not an IMS basket, but we'll get to that. 

Original tamper, homemade WDT, and Kingrinder K6 grinder. It's been working well with 14/15g, but this one I pulled with the single dose basket using 8/9g. It seems like a good extraction. The espresso is super aromatic, quite bitter, even spicy, but very pleasant. IMS 16/18g basket, IMS shower and delonghi tamper are on the way.

They say this machine works better with darker roasts, so I've already asked fellows at /cafept for advice on some options to try.

Anywho:
 Did you guys go and get tested for mycotoxins? 
Should I find a doctor that would order a mycotoxin test? Or just start ordering it and researching myself?

So, whether it’s for the quality of the food, the ambience, or just the novelty of it being something a bit different - what are some of your favourite, must-try places to eat and grab coffee in Makati?

Just to add: it doesn’t matter if it’s a food truck, a pop-up at Salcedo Market, a bougie dining experience, or a humble local joint - I’m open to everything.

Our first Sandals experience was last year at St Vincent and even though this week has been amazing, I think we were spoilt with starting at St Vincent. 
Both bookings were Club Level, but the rooms at St Vincent were superior in size, storage and we also had a mini gym in the room too. 
The food at the restaurants in Halcyon is good, but we felt St Vincent was a class higher and Halcyon uses way too much salt in their seasoning for my liking. Having the coffee shops at St Vincent is also a lovely touch. 
All of the staff at St Vincent were happy, friendly and gave the feeling that they loved their jobs. Only a handful at Halcyon give that feeling, most are just here to do the minimum effort needed unfortunately. 
We booked an excursion and ordered a breakfast box with it. We arrived at the excursion desk at 6:40am as told and the bus arrived at 7:10am. We had nearly given up waiting, but could not check as reception did not know and the excursion desk did not start until 8am. When the bus arrived there was no breakfast box and we were off on a 4 hour hike up a mountain. As the bus was late, Bayside had started breakfast so I filled a plate with pastries and took it onto the bus to eat on the journey. 
Less than half of the beds around the pool have umbrellas. Not great when the occasional downpour occurs and anyone without an umbrella has to pack up and find shelter. 
Our final grumble is not the fault of Sandals, we should have spotted it on the map when booking. There’s a main road passes right by the resort and all you hear all day by the pool is the traffic. St Vincent was down a long drive and in a bay so it’s really peaceful. 

We have booked for South Coast next year to try and support Jamaica after the hurricane. Looking forward to it already ",3,1764332347.0,SandalsResorts,1,1.0,False

My current machine was purchased refurbished from Whole Latte Love several years ago. I have upgraded the steam wand, gone to bottomless portafilter, nanotech portafilter baskets, puck screen, nanotech shower screen, and silicone group gasket. I am not looking forward to buying a new machine and then having to go through the expense of upgrading everything again for the new machine. But this machine is getting old and tired.

My typical usage is one milk drink in the morning. I brew and froth at the same time. Occasionally I'll do multiple drinks if we have guests. 

The Expobar measures about 9"" W x 15"" H x 16.5"" D. My space does not allow for anything much larger.

I roast my own beans using a Hottop Coffee Roaster.

I am very happy with my HX machine as I typically do not do more than two drinks at a time and it has the ability to brew and froth simultaneously. I would like to have gauges to let me know how the pressures are running.

I have looked at Profitec 400 or 500, Rocket Apartamento, ECM, etc. It seems that size is the major challenge.",1,1764332300.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

After that I drove him to the nearest town 20km away and gave him 100 lari to get some food, tobacco and booze...

1p8tev9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CKD/comments/1p8tev9/gi_symptoms_question/,GI Symptoms Question,"Hello, all.  I was diagnosed with CKD 3a June 2022.  Since then, I’ve cut out alcohol, red meat, shellfish, eat mostly vegetarian (occasional poultry and fish), drink one cup of coffee and maybe caffeine free tea at night, water throughout the day. 

A few weeks ago, I had a day where I had intense belching and GI issues. I sipped water, which helped, but it last about 24 hours.  Cut to last night (Thanksgiving evening).   I had a typical holiday meal (turkey, mashed potatoes, dressing, gravy, green beans, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie).  Last night, the belching returned and I’ve had GI issues all night (only got 2 hours of sleep).  UPDATE: vomitted a few moments ago. I think I’m going to contact my doctor.  Below are more detailed symptoms, but I’m blocking them out as “spoilers” so folks can ignore if they don’t want the details. I’m thinking the food i had was too heavy in fat and protein content. I’m also concerned this might be a new “thread unlocked” with my CKD.  I don’t take any meds for it yet. I’m currently on synthroid for hypothyroidism, Wegovy (was on the cusp of diabetic and seriously overweight.  Gym and diet wasn’t cutting it). Vitamin D for vitamin deficiency.

I guess what I’m wondering is if anyone else experiences this and if I should be worried.  I don’t have a nephrologist. My PCP wanted to manage it through diet and lifestyle changes.  After this I am definitely going full vegetarian and may consider vegan.

Thank you for any thoughts you might be willing to share. 

Belching : >!It smells sulfuric and I have a texture sensation of soda pop in my mouth when it happens.  Considering I don’t drink carbonated beverages, I’m not sure why this is happening.!<
