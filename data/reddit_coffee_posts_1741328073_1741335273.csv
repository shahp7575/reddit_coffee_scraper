I just bought a cheap 2 cup moka pot off the internet and I use a gas stove on the lowest setting. The first few tries I had a problem with sputtering (saw on some of the posts that I just need to lube the gasket with some water and really tighten it up). I don't know if the lack of crema is due to the super low heat or if I just have old pre ground coffee (about 2 months in the shelf). Is the flow ok? Should I increase the heat?

Note: In the last 10-20 seconds, I increased the heat slightly to see if it would produce more crema.

Also, should there still be some water left in the boiler? I always have some left on all my attempts.",2,1741334835.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Each week for the last four weeks SHE (to make that clear, it was her initiating every time.) asked to set something up, and either the day would come and she’d ghost me until hours after, or she’d cancel the day before. I talked to her about how if she wasn’t ready to get to know someone or if she just wasn’t feeling me specifically that was fine, I just needed her to communicate that with me. She told me she really wanted to get to know me, and she was just dealing with some stuff.

So, we made plans to meet up yesterday. We both live kinda far from each other (about an hour drive total, based off what she said) and made plans to meet at a coffee shop that she told me was about 30 minutes from her house. Oddly, it was 50 minutes from my place, but I chalked that up to maybe traffic. She told me we’d meet up after therapy, and that the office was a 2 minute walk from her house. Her area is one I’m familiar with, as the place she goes to therapy is the same place that I went to years ago and that building has the only therapists in a large radius. On the drive to the coffee shop, I realized that it was down the street from this therapists office. This had me confused, because it seemed weird that she would repeatedly tell me that this coffee shop was equidistant to both of our places despite it very obviously being 5 minutes away from hers. I let it go, and sat down to wait for her. Hours went by, and each time I told her I was just going to go she insisted she was on her way and asked me to wait. After 3 hours, she stopped responding at all, so I went home. I was pretty hurt, and I left her a voice message or two basically saying that I didn’t want to be around someone who was either a) very obviously ignorant of other people’s feelings, or b) simply not in the right place to put effort towards getting to know someone that way, and didn’t want to be honest about that. I also made it clear that I didn’t appreciate her blatantly lying to me, and that I would have been happy to accommodate whatever it was she needed if she’d just been honest about it. With that, I told her not to contact me again. 
I simply deleted her number after, but my coworker that’s also a friend of hers has talked to her since then. He’s told me that I was too harsh and hurtful in the way I responded, and I should have been more willing to hear her out instead of jumping to conclusions. This was the first time I’d made an attempt at dating for over 2 years after an extremely toxic and unhealthy relationship which caused me to become an extremely guarded person, so I can see how I might have been too quick to put up a wall. But I also don’t want to be around someone who lies about little things like that, and I really don’t want to be around someone who can’t just be up front and clear with me from the beginning instead of sending all these mixed messages.

1j5ifmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1j5ifmz/the_ring_analysis_why_is_your_exs_wedding_like/,"The ""Ring"" Analysis: Why is your ex's wedding like wearing a mask of happiness?","**And we continue with the suffering ladies. No, there won’t be any memes or jokes here either. First, I’m too lazy. Second, the format doesn’t allow it.**

**What the song is about:**

Imagine: you’re standing at the wedding of someone you still love. You say “congratulations” (“omedetou”), clap your hands, but inside—there’s emptiness. The heroine is right there: her pain is hidden behind smiles and rituals. The sparkle of the ring on his ring finger (“kushinayubi no ring”) is not a symbol of love for her, but a nail in the coffin of their relationship. The main question: “Will I ever be able to love again?” (“kore kara saki kimi ijou ni dareka wo suki ni nareru no?”).

**Emotions—from bitter irony to quiet despair:**

* Tears behind the mask: She says “thank you” (“arigatou”) for the invitation, but her tears taste “like bitter coffee” (“koohii mitai ni nigai namida aji”).
* The curse of nostalgia: Memories spin like an old film reel (“suri kirete shimau made ripurei”) until they fade. And his “sweet-and-sour kiss” (“amazuppai kisu”) now burns like salt on a wound.
* Fake applause: Every “cheers!” from the guests feels like a punch to the gut. Even the bells (“shukufuku no kane”) sound like a funeral toll.

**How the lyrics are structured:**

1. **Deadly contrasts:** The sparkle of the ring vs. the darkness in her soul, the joyful cheers of the guests vs. the question “why does it hurt so much?” (“doushite konna ni mune ga kurushii no?”).
2. **Sounds as torture:** The applause and music drown out her true feelings—a classic Japanese “tatemae” (social mask), behind which lies “honne” (true pain).
3. **Questions without answers:** “Will I ever love again?”—she’s not asking him, but the mirror. And yes, the mirror stays silent.

**Why this is “very Japanese”:**

The lyrics echo the Japanese concepts of “honne and tatemae”—the contradiction between true feelings and the social mask. The wedding, as a ritual, showcases “tatemae” (external correctness), while “honne” (the heroine’s pain) remains invisible. The ring on the ring finger, significant in Japanese culture as a symbol of eternal connection, here becomes a sign of separation, amplifying the tragedy—harsh, but realistic.

**Personal opinion:**

""Ring"" is a quiet tragedy amidst the noise of celebration, where every congratulation feels like a knife to the heart. If in ""Raindrops"" the tears blended with the rain, here they dissolve into fake smiles and applause.

**What resonates:**

* **Duality everywhere:** Even the title plays with words: “Ring” is both “ring” and “echo” (of pain that doesn’t fade).
* **The evolution of pain:** At first, the heroine tries to convince herself: “I’ll be happy too!” (“boku mo shiawase ni nareru to omoetara ii noni”). By the end—she realizes her heart is forever locked in the past.
* **Connection to other tracks:** If in ""Baka Mitai"" the hero screamed “I’m a fool,” here the heroine silently swallows the lump in her throat. But both songs are about unspoken feelings that kill.

**What might not click:**

Some might say: “Well, a wedding, a ring, tears—how cliché!” But it’s like cherry blossoms: yes, it’s the same every year, but when you see the petals fall—it still hits you.

**Conclusion:**

The song is a manifesto of invisible grief. It’s about how social rituals become a cage for true feelings. ""Ring"" offers no comfort: the final question about future love remains unanswered, and the sparkle of the ring serves as a reminder—some wounds don’t heal, they just teach us the art of wearing masks. It’s about how we applaud someone else’s happiness, forcing a smile, and then go home to stare at the ceiling, asking: “What’s wrong with me?”

*P.S. If after this song you suddenly remembered how you once said “congratulations” through gritted teeth—you’re not alone. Maybe it’s time to take off the mask and finally exhale? At least in front of the mirror?*",2,1741334248.0,yakuzagames,1,1.0,False

In doing so, we’ve seen a lot of houses that were great but didn’t have a nice neighborhood surrounding them, which has left us conflicted about moving. The best thing about our current house is that it’s in a peaceful but walkable neighborhood with a lot of young families. I love being able to take the stroller and go on a 10ish minute walk to take our child to the park, grocery shop, get coffee, or a bite to eat. It seems really difficult to find bigger houses with similar surroundings. 

We’ve recently been looking at Willow Glen because it seems to offer that. I grew up in the bay and always heard of Willow Glen as a great family area. What I’m confused about is that the school ratings don’t seem to be very good. But I know ratings aren’t everything, and don’t want to be one of those parents who obsesses with sending their kids to the highest rated schools where they are under a ton of stress and everyone else there is just like them. I want a place that has caring teachers, a good learning environment, the resources/mindset to nurture a child’s interests, and will set them up well for their future. In these respects, are Willow Glen schools actually better than the ratings would indicate? Does anyone have personal experience with them and can share?

I get the impression a lot of people in the area send their kids to private school, but I never thought I would do that. It also seems like a lot of the popular private schools are religiously based, and neither my husband nor I are religious. There are areas with higher rated schools that we could afford to buy in, and we would rather put our money into that than private school, but they don’t seem to offer the same walkability or neighborhood feel.",0,1741333555.0,BayAreaRealEstate,2,0.5,False

Indian tiktoker/streamer ShaktyG set up his professional streaming equipment in a local coffee shop Bricks & Brew despite the shops policy regarding professional shooting/streaming which was posted upon the entrance of the premises and on their counter.

The influencer, security guard and administration management got into a heated argument as the influencer refused to acknowledge the compound's policy.

Later that night on his tiktok and Kick live stream, ShaktyG discussed what he experienced and accused the staffs of being aggressive, racist, and ungrateful through fabricated lies and posted continuous questions of why he wasn’t allowed to do his live streaming. He even mentioned that the shop should be “thankful as they needed him to make the shop viral” and “what he did was actually free promotions for the store”. The shop were also targeted by his followers on his live, on Google, and on Facebook with negative reviews even if they haven’t visited the shop yet, and even propagating hate through tagging the shop as the, “racist cafe”.

1j5i97w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchengenVisa/comments/1j5i97w/schengen_tourist_visa_with_family_appreciation/,Schengen Tourist Visa - with family - appreciation note,"A short note to thank everyone on this forum for keeping this space so vibrant and relevant - we found it very useful while preparing for our visa application.

My family of 4 (me M47, wife, 2 children) applied for the Schengen Visa yday with the Austrian embassy at the Bangalore VFS office. 

Countries we are intending to visit: 

Austria (7 days), Switzerland (2 days), France (5 days)

Duration: 14 days

Few points I wanted to share that may come in useful for others - especially if you are travelling as family with children.

1. While booking an appointment on the VFS site, only one appointment slot is sufficient if you are travelling together as a family. We got this verified by calling the VFS Helpline before hand. If you try booking 4 slots, the appointment dates will be further away which would be an issue, if you are in a hurry to travel (like us). The security at the VFS entrance may not be familiar with this process of allowing 4 people with just one slot, so he may ask you to step aside while he checks with the VFS people inside. The VFC center head called up someone in Delhi and got the clarification that this is indeed allowed. So this took about 20-25mins. We had an 8AM appointment, but we got inside the center at around 8.25AM due to this.

Overall during this time, the VFS people were extremely polite and professional.

Please ensure that you reach the center 20mins before your appointment. 4W & 2W paid parking is in the basement. There are tea/coffee/refreshments available just outside the VFS office entrance on the ground floor. Laptops/Pen drives not allowed, there is a storage area where you can safely keep them (paid service)

  
2. Once inside the VFS center, they were extremely efficient. At the Austrian desk, the documents checking and bio metrics for the 4 of us took us an hour exactly. By 9.30AM we were outside.

  
3. Please follow the list of documents exactly as per the VFS checklist.

\- Take 2 photos though the check list says one! (one pasted in the visa application form, and one they will ask separately)

4. In your visa application - ie., the dad or mom (assuming both are working)

\- Ensure you attach your 3 month payslips, and offer letter, and NOC to travel which has the dates mentioned. Ensure that the NOC contains the company letterhead, and has a name of the HR contact, and a phone number of the company mentioned. 

5. In the children's visa application:

\- \[Field #10:\] Write your name, address, email, phone.

\- \[Field #29:\] If you are an Indian returning back to India leave this blank. If you are an Indian working elsewhere eg., US and you are applying to travel from US to Schengen - then in this field you will need to enter the details of our US Visa which will allow you re-entry back to the US after your Schengen visit.

\- \[Field #32:\] Details of who will support the expenses of the child. Tick the box on the right where it says (host/company, org) and check the box below that which says ""Other"" and write your name below that and say ""Father"" or ""Mother"" - since the Father or Mother will be financing the expenses for the child. 

Below that, check the box which says ""All expenses covered during stay""

And also write a simple one page letter, addressed to the Embassy saying that you will be covering all expenses of the child during the period for air, train, accommodation ,food etc. Please mention dates, passport number in the letter. Both parents will have to sign the letter.

\- \[Field #33:\]  Enter parents name, address, email, phone.

\- Both parents have to sign on the last page (children do not need to sign, if they are 17yrs or below)

\- You need to attach a bonafide certificate from your child's school

  
6. Write a cover letter (though the checklist does not mention it) and say:

\- Why you want to travel to these specific countries

\- Mention an itinerary of the dates, what places you will visit on each day, printouts of the hotel reservations, flight, train

\- How you will support your expenses - mention details of your bank account and balance; any other investments that you have like stocks/mutual funds and their value, land, property (support all this with printouts of the documents)

\- Why you will return back - mention family ties, job, ties to community, property that you have (I attached 1st page of sale deed of my apartment, and last property tax paid receipt that has my name - got this idea from this reddit forum!)

\- Cover letter needs to be signed by both husband and wife - if both are working, and both are suporting the expenses of the trip.

\- Take 4 copies of the cover letter, and keep one copy each in each of the applications file - both parents, and 2 children.

 7. Collating all the documents, taking photo copies, visiting the bank, school for the statements, bonifide certificates etc, researching and making the flight bookings, train bookings, hotel bookings, researching on what places to visit in each country (since your cover letter needs to have all these details), reading reviews, reading forums like this one on Reddit  - all of this takes hell a lot of time. Me and my wife massively under estimated it and ended up not sleeping the whole night before our VFS appointment (we slept just 50mins). This is assuming you want to do everything yourself without a travel agent. Please budget about 45-50 person hours for all of this. (not counting trips to the bank/school etc)

8. Ensure your printer at home is in good working condition with all the ink and all topped up. For some reason on this forum I read that colour printouts are preferred where possible. And printing in colour is slower as well. Roughly you will to print about 40 pages per applicant as per the checklist.

9. Take all your old expired passports along. They will need it.

10. At VFS, they said if you opt for VFS Courier add-on (Rs 800 per applicant) you will get the Visa in hand 2 days earlier, since it gets sent to your home directly from Delhi - as opposed to being shipped to VFS Bangalore office, and then they calling you and you visiting them. I opted for that.

11. Please follow everything in the checklist carefully. If you have any doubts about some fields make a mark with a pencil in the margin and ask the VFS Visa person who is checking the documentation. They are helpful even if you haven't opted for the premium VFS service package.

12. At the VFS reception, they will say that if you opt for VFS Premium service (approx Rs 4,500 per applicant), you will get a longer document submission window to resubmit documents in case anything is missing (I'm assuming till 3 or 4pm the same day). They do not pressurize you, they just mention it as an information. If you are confident about your documentation, the basic VFS service is good enough.

I will update you all on whether our visa was accepted or rejected - it will take 3 calendar weeks they said, so hopefully by 30/Mar we will know.

I used to be that student who'd ""study tomorrow."" You know the type:

* Endless coffee but zero focus
* Highlighting entire textbooks in neon yellow (as if that helps)
* ""Just one more YouTube video"" turning into a 3-hour rabbit hole
* Panic-studying the night before exams
* Wondering why I couldn't retain anything

My GPA was in free fall. I was sleeping 4 hours a night during finals week. My study notes looked like abstract art. Something had to change.

# The Turning Point

I decided to treat my studies like an RPG character progression. Instead of vague promises to ""study more,"" I started tracking actual hours of focused work. I set up a 30-day challenge for myself:

The Rules:

1. Track EVERY study session (length and quality)
2. No phone during focus blocks
3. Study with others for accountability
4. Visualize progress daily
5. Celebrate small wins

# Results

Week 1: Struggled to focus for 30 minutes straight. Kept reaching for my phone like an addict.

Week 2: Started using the peazehub for my challenge. The stats, leaderboard to help my gamification challenge

Week 3: Hit my first 4-hour deep work session without feeling drained. Started joining online study groups.

Week 4: Completed more quality study hours in one month than the entire previous semester.

# The Transformation:

* Before: 5-6 scattered hours/week of ""kind of studying""
* After: 50+ hours/week of actual, focused learning
* GPA: From 2.7 to 3.8 in one semester
* Sleep quality: Drastically improved (no more last-minute panic)
* Stress levels: Cut in half
* Retention: Actually, remembering what I study

# What I Learned

The biggest revelation wasn't finding the ""perfect system"" - it was realizing that *consistency beats intensity every single time.*

Those 45-minute focused sessions three times a day accomplished more than my previous all-nighters ever did. And tracking my progress visually made all the difference.

I watched a bunch of videos on the importance of temp surfing (in absence of a PID), and pre-infusion, and how you should start steaming before the light turns on... but all this was for the older models without the brass boiler.

I can't find any good info or videos on the E24 that cover the same topic. So I'm curious, do you guys do all this? What is your routine? Or just hit brew and let er rip?

---

My old routine was to just let it get hot for 20-30 minutes, then just attach the pf and turn it on. But I started to notice that if i let it get that hot steam shoots out violently for the first few seconds from the brew head, figured I'm probably burning the coffee and disturbing the puck. 

The thing I tried today (only once so far) for a lighter roasted coffee:

* let it get hot for 30 minutes with pf in
* Grind, puck prep, wdt, tamp, etc.
* turn brew switch on for 7 seconds (without pf attached) and light turns off
* turn switch off and wait for light to come back on, attach pf at this point
* when light comes on, turn steam switch on for 6 seconds, then off
* NOW start my shot
* did not do any pre-infusion, haven't played around with this yet.

For the steam wand:

* after shot, turn steam switch on
* When light comes on, purge for like 1 sec, then stop, and then steam the milk

I am struggling to stick to them.,"I am here to share my story of my experience meeting someone with BPD, falling in love with that someone, the eventual break up(s) and where I am now. 

Roughly 1 year ago I (34M) met a girl (27F) and fell very hard, very fast for her. The relationship began with some casual walks, and long talks about our pasts. Most of the conversations were focused around her and her trauma. I learned later that this sort of 'technique' was called trauma dumping. I had so much empathy towards what she'd gone through and felt all sorts of desires to step up and be the man that she 'deserved'.

  
Things moved very fast, very quickly so we decided to pump the brakes but this occurred after a weekend of passionate sex, her professing her love for me (we had known each other for 2 weeks at this point and only became intimate in the last 5 days) but I couldn't help but say it back. After the 'pumping of the brakes' she went on a trip and slept with someone else. Totally fair, we weren't exclusive, but it still hurt and she felt the need to tell me the moment we saw each other after her trip.

  
I should've backed off at this point but I couldn't get enough. Despite her devaluing me on this trip after trauma dumping and love bombing me prior to her going away. However I felt as if she hadn't done anything 'wrong' and owed me no true apology. We weren't exclusive and after this trip we decided we were exactly that moving forward.

  
I grew to become incredibly attached and the next couple of months were chaotic. We were spending most nights together. Sex was very frequent for us. We didn't really go out much but spent almost every evening and morning together before parting ways for work. Things were going fairly well and I was absolutely head over heels for this woman. But I couldn't quite feel secure with her. She wasn't very compassionate and I felt as if I was giving so much more than I was getting in return. This made me feel insecure and eventually caused a fight which lead to a break up.

  
We spent a month apart but still talking, sometimes on the phone or facetime but not meeting up. We reconnected at the end of that month for 'casual sex' which I really tried to put forth but my emotions got the best of me and instead of telling her my feelings I basically booty called her then sent her on her way. I honestly thought that's what she wanted but to be fair I didn't handle things perfectly. 

  
This led to a fight/argument a couple days later to which point I had to block her and move on. I was still madly in love with this woman but I knew I wasn't moving forward unless I cut ties. I 'blocked' her but I was just ignoring her messages whilst still reading them and wishing things could've worked out. In this gap of about a month where I didn't respond to her I tried to date around. Nothing compared to her. The connection, the emotional connection, the physical connection; nothing compared to being with her. 

  
One night I was drunk leaving the bar and noticed I had a missed call from her about 30 mins before. I was walking home and called her back without even thinking about it. She said she had a 'friend' over and couldn't really talk and I shrugged it off as if it was probably a good thing. She called back 10 mins later saying they left and we spoke a bit until we decided to meet up in person. We opened up about the past couple of months, expressed how we felt and reconnected intimately. 

  
Not long after that we decided to try again as we felt the time apart made us feel that we belonged together. We hung out for a bit, started dating again, she had essentially moved in to my apartment and the next few months were nice. We were spending every single night together at my place and full on living together. We went from not speaking to reconnecting and living together in like maybe 5 days. 

  
As we lived together in my place we would fight about once a week. Whether it was about work or me not giving enough to the relationship. I was walking her dog, I was putting work off (my job wasn't as schedule intensive) to cater to her needs, I was supporting her and making sure I was available for whatever she needed. It was never enough. We would talk about how best to love and support each other but it was never enough. 

  
I felt like I was getting 99% on a test and still failing. I let her move in as much as she wanted into my apartment. She was moving in her plants, her fish, her dog, basically most of everything she had so that she could feel comfortable in my space. It still wasn't enough and started to really cause issues between us. Neither of us were overly happy.

  
In this timeframe she was hunting for a house to buy and move into. With the intention of me moving in as she was constantly talking about marriage, having babies and spending the rest of our lives together. Honestly, it all sounded magical. I was still madly in love with this woman even though her love for me seemed to change every hour. 

  
She eventually picked a house (I went to every viewing and had my opinions and tried to keep them as reserved and diplomatic as possible. I didn't agree with a lot of what she was searching for but this house was meant to be hers and I would live in it, not a house we picked together) and I moved in the same day she did. Since our reconnection to us moving in to this house together 4 months had gone by. I broke my lease to make this work because she really wanted us to move in together and not have her settle in first then me move in after.

  
Since we lived together things began to get a little difficult. We had a roommate as well to help with the mortgage. I signed a legal document to ensure I had no claim to the house (her dad's idea, not hers) and it all seemed so crazy. It was a flurry of emotion and chaos and passion and sex and laughter and sadness and every single feeling you could even imagine. 



Being with this woman was a roller coaster. The highs were so high and the lows were so low. She would sometimes break into a dance party at midnight. She would prance around and be bursting with joy. Have the night of her life and confess how deeply she loved me and how badly she wanted to marry and have kids with me.



Then the next morning she would wake up completely miserable. If I didn't get up and walk the dog or make coffee or if I asked her what she wanted to do that day it would completely set her off. Of course I didn't fully understand what she was going through. Although I had read books, read posts on these subs, ask around to people who'd experienced dating someone with BPD. I tried so hard to understand but it still didn't prepare me for what was to happen.



She guilted me into quitting drinking because she thought it was a problem in our relationship. It came out later that it was actually an issue she had with her family and her past but she projected it upon me to try and stabilize how much we fought. I quit for 6 weeks, not a drop and we still fought all the same. 



She then decided to quit vaping and on day 2 became....well she didn't want to exist anymore. I wasn't prepared for this. It was a wild night and broke us both immensely. She got through it but turns out she was vaping at work so not exactly quitting?? Then she tried to quit again a few days later and it got really bad. 



The fights hit hard enough to set my brain back and let me assess what was happening. I ultimately decided to end things and it shattered her. I moved out and have tried to keep my distance but it's been unsuccessful.



 I blocked her on socials, blocked her number but she found a way to email me. We've met up a couple times since I have moved out. Nothing intimate but sat and talked. I miss her so bad. I also know I can never be with her again.

  
I don't exactly know what is making me want to write this but ultimately I know it's not easy to break up with anyone, however I find my experience being in love with someone who has BPD has been the hardest and most passionate relationship I've ever had. I will always love this woman. She will always be able to break me down and I have to remain strong in keeping distance. 

  
Pray for my strength to keep her blocked and my ability to avoid connecting with her.

  
I realize now I wrote this to avoid writing to her. Thanks for listening.

I just couldn't find the floor plan for it so, I tried recreating it myself. I went from 30 sqm/323 sqft to 22 sqm/237 sqft! Excluding the garden office and the tiny pool. I'm planning to have at least a 3-4 sqm dipping pool. That would be ultra cute. Btw, this house is not meant for a family. This is ideal for singles only or a couple. I'm the only one living here so, I feel like it's perfect.

I also took inspo from the feedback I received last time, thank you! 

If you're wondering why I don't have a designated storage area or a room for the laundry, my washing machine is going to fit right in the toilet&bathroom. It's a top loader, about 4-5kg capacity so, it's pretty tiny and I am able to fit at least a week worth of clothes in it. 

There's ample storage for cleaning supplies in the bathroom, a storage for my clothes right next to the bathroom door. If I wanna add more storage, I can just remove the side coffee table and put a cabinet for more storage.

Ps. I know the stairs look wonky and it's because I drew it since the stairs I want is not available in the platform I made this floorplan on which is Rayon, so I guess that's why it's pretty ugly, lol. But the vision of the stairs is better in my head. I'll also add motion sensor lights and hand rails so I don't fall and die in the middle of the night trying to get a drink or go to the toilet. 

I hope you guys like it tho!

With tariffs popping up in headlines again, I wanted to piece together how Canada’s been taxing U.S. goods over time. I looked at the chill days before 2018, the rollercoaster from 2018 to 2024, and what’s hitting now in 2025. It’s detailed but quick to scan, with some extra context where it fits. Felt it is important to have some context of the history here because i keep seeing so much BS all over Reddit. 

Before 2018: Smooth Sailing with NAFTA

Back before 2018, Canada and the U.S. had a sweet deal with NAFTA, the trade agreement from 1994. Most stuff crossed the border without any extra fees. But Canada had some big exceptions.

	•Most things paid nothing: cars, steel, TVs, machinery, all zero.
	•Farm goods got tricky. Canada’s supply management system protected its farmers with steep tariffs:
	•Dairy hit hard: milk at 270 percent, cheese at 245 percent, butter at 298 percent.
	•Poultry and eggs too: chicken at 238 percent, turkey at 154 percent, eggs at 163 percent.
	•Other crops like wheat or corn usually came in free.

Quick note: Those crazy dairy and poultry taxes were Canada’s way of keeping its farmers safe from cheap U.S. imports. Everything else flowed easy under NAFTA.

2018 to 2024: Things Got Messy

Then 2018 rolled around, and Trump shook things up big time. Canada had to respond, and it was a wild ride until 2024.

	•In 2018, Trump put 25 percent on Canadian steel and 10 percent on aluminum, saying it was about security. Canada hit back with taxes on $12 billion of U.S. stuff, think whiskey, ketchup, even maple syrup.
	•By 2019, they talked it out and dropped those extra fees.
	•In 2020, NAFTA got replaced with USMCA. Most tariffs stayed low, but U.S. dairy got a bit more room to sell in Canada.
	•From 2021 to 2024, it was quiet. The old farm tariffs hung around, but no huge changes.

Side bit: That 2018 fight was Trump pushing hard, but it fizzled fast. USMCA kept things mostly the same, though Canada’s dairy rules still annoyed the U.S.

2025: Tariffs Are Back and Bigger

Now it’s 2025, and we’re in a full-on tariff storm. Trump’s at it again, and Canada’s not sitting still.

-February 2025: Trump taxed all Canadian goods at 25 percent (energy at 10 percent), blaming Canada for border and drug problems.

-Canada fought back with 25 percent on $155 billion of U.S. goods:

-Right away: $30 billion worth. peanut butter, coffee, furniture, random everyday stuff.

-Soon: $125 billion more, like cars, beef, and steel, after a short review.

-Some provinces are even banning U.S. liquor or charging American trucks extra at the border.

This is a massive trade clash. With $600 billion swapped yearly, prices could climb and shelves might thin out.


I grabbed numbers from old trade rules and fresh reports. Canada and the U.S. trade a ton, so this stuff matters.Dairy’s always the big sticking point!

About 6 months ago I broke up with her. After she stormed out in a tearful rage, I panicked and begged her to give me another chance. I felt I’d made a huge mistake. I asked her to come back, and she did. 

Last week I met a girl in my class. She asked me to go to get coffee and discuss a project. Talking to her was like a breath of fresh air. It made me realize I’ve been unhappy because my girlfriend just doesn’t get me, and maybe never really did. 

I started texting new girl. Just conversation, not pursuing a relationship, but I realized I wanted to, so I hid the texts. Last night my girlfriend saw me texting and it all blew up. She called me a cheater and we had a huge fight. I left and said I wasn’t coming back.

This happened in the four months prior to the global shutdown because of the COVID pandemic (because of course the first time I get a relationship, God gives me the biggest sign to break up with him).

I met Dan (fake name) in a minor class that accepted students of different majors. He was pre-law. I was pre-med.

It was a pretty cliche romcom situation: one day, out of nowhere I notice this guy staring at me from the front of the class (chronic back-of-classroom seater here hehe). For a moment I thought he was just staring into space and just happened to be looking at my direction. But nope~

The next days he kept looking back at me, smiling when I met his eyes (which was hard NOT to do, and I tried not to, but he was seated in front and I had to look in front… you get it). We never talked until one day, when I came in late and found the class grouped up. I panicked, not knowing anyone, and frantically looked for an empty seat near a group i can kind of integrate myself into. 

Out of the mass of grouped people, Dan stands up and invites me over, smiling at me and clearing a space for me, taking my bag and all. I thank him gratefully and then mentally psych myself to calm down and keep up with what the groupwork is about. 

Dan doesn’t allow me to. He chats me up, asking about me and all that. All this under the watchful eye of our professor and our other groumates. I was embarrassed but answered back, trying to steer the conversation into the groupwork. At some point he gets the hint and we finally do the work. 

When the class ends, I scurry ahead, trying to avoid having to talk to anyone else and just get to my next class. I notice Dan with a girl who he holds hands with and then carries her bag. I feel dirty and decide not to get embroiled in that mess. 

A month passes. It’s January. I get a message request in Messenger. It’s Dan. He introduces himself and comments on the philosophical public posts I share on Facebook. We talk. I like having our philosophical debates that I don’t usually get to do with my friends who are more into hard science.

A few weeks later, he asks me out and I say “okayyy” because he listens and makes me happy. I know, the bar is low; but I was delulu. 

We go on the first date. He talks about having just gotten out of a relationship that didn’t end well and having a FBuddy. I tell him I don’t have experience and want to wait till marriage. He rubs my knuckles when we hold hands and rubs his face on my shoulder when he sits next to me. I am mortified but keep quiet (people pleaser detected). 

The next dates I advocate for coffee dates and sometimes study dates. He says okay, but in his room. I say okay. We have the dates. All is well. 

Until Valentine’s day. He wants to go all the way. I say maybe just a hug first. He hugs me so tight. We cuddle for an afternoon nap. 

Then the next days he keeps wanting more. He starts debating me on my religious beliefs. Who is God? Is He real? Why wait until marriage? He shows me YouTube videos that discredit His existence. 

I hate him for it and ask him how he knows what is true? What is the basis of truth? Who is to say he is right and I am wrong?

I don’t talk to him for a few days. And then he invites me for a talk. I go. He apologizes. I say okayyy and go in for a hug. 

He holds me a little too tightly and starts kissing my neck. I tell him to stop it. And then I am on the floor and he is on top. My shirt is gone and he is whispering, “You’re okay; it’s just me. I got you”. My face is cold and I am shaking. 

And then he makes me feel good. But when everything is done and he hugs me in his sleep, I feel dirty. Did I want this? Is this real? Am I at fault? Is this alright?

I get up at sunrise and say goodbye. I walk out of his room and blame myself. I was too weak. I gave in too easily. I feel disgusted at myself. I cover my mirrors and my altar. 

I feel so awful and eventually decide to break up with him on April via email (since we can’t meet anymore due to quarantine). I call him a r*pper because I told him I wanted to wait. He says that’s unfair because I felt good and asked for more. I don’t deny it and feel dirty all the more. 

He tells me “You will never find anyone who will accept you like I did.” And I still think about that up to today. Maybe he’s right.

One look at my profile will tell you that I am not here for Karma. I am only making this post as somewhat of a eulogy to something I considered immutable. And for closure.

I met this nerd in first period on our second day of Freshman year in the early 90's, all because of Star Trek: The Next Generation. We were both brand new to our municipal school system. Me, because I had moved here that summer and him because he had been raised Lutheran and had been schooled at the church. Neither of us knew anyone from the local public schools. We ended up sat next to each other, and I noticed that he had written in his notebook, ""Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra,"" to which I said, ""When the walls fell."" We shook hands, introduced ourselves, and thus began a 31 year friendship.

Now, I don't think we could be any more different from one another. For example, I was an atheist (now, more anti-theist) and he was and is a hard-core Lutheran. We've had... countless debates over the years, always respectful and never sullied by insults or name-calling. If there was anything that was completely obvious from the start, it's that this kid was unwavering in his convictions. Sets his mind to something and could not be persuaded to see another point of view, even if a mountain of evidence fell on his head. But with all that said, we shared a love of adventure and we live in a place that generously rewards going off the beaten path, so our friendship endured and prospered.

When he was in his late 20's, he took some classes at our local university but never completed a degree. He got severely into debt with student loans. After he dropped out of college, he worked entry-level jobs. Warehouse stocking, cashiering, things like that. Eventually, he got a job that he likes, but doesn't pay a living wage. He's been there for over 15 years, now, barely making $20/hr. He's still paying his student loans.

I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. I'd held two part-time jobs during my last years in school, so I was already in the job market. I figured I'd be alright without college. I ended up landing in a very niche field, one that isn't taught in any school, anywhere. It requires licensing and my position requires that I be a Notary Public. After 14 years in the industry, I was burnt out and had an opportunity for a fresh start back in my home State, sponsored by family. I was recently divorced, so I took that opportunity, and it was both the worst and best decision I'd ever made. The best part about it is that in doing so I learned a valuable trade. The worst part was, I experienced utter poverty. There was a point where, after I'd sold off almost everything of value that I had, I didn't have fifty cents to my name.

It was during this lowest point of my life that he decided to come visit for two weeks. We took a road trip across the country to visit old friends that neither of us had seen in years. I was not working, so I had all the time in the world. He fronted the entire bill. The rental car, the gas, my food and coffee. Everything. And all without any expectation of being repaid, because we was fuckin' homies from old times.

After six years away, I decided to come back ""home."" It happened to be at a point in time where my niche industry was hurting for experienced personnel and I was able to secure an absurdly handsome benefits package. One that I can afford to live alone in a nice home. He was living with his brother and another roommate, which was over an hour commute (one-way) to work for him. He wanted to move closer to work, to save on gas, but we're in a rather high cost-of-living area so he couldn't do so on his own. Well, if you can help those you love, you help. So, I rented us a house and charged him 25% of the monthly expenses. For two and a half years.

Well, last week, we had a rather heated debate. The subject matter is immensely important to me, and maybe even to you, but not to this post. I told him if he was dead set in his belief, than we couldn't be friends anymore. I lost my temper, in light of his ignorant dismissal of the actual, factual motherfucking facts. He doesn't work on Thursdays, so I was planning on speaking with him when I got home today. To see if he'd done the research that he said he'd ""have to do."" If he was still set in his beliefs, I was going to offer him a chance to either pay 50% of the monthly expenses (which I knew he couldn't easily afford) or move out. I don't need a roommate, so both options benefit me.

He had moved out by the time I got home. And that's OK.

I was previously going to bed at 2:00 and waking up at 9:00 due work and usually I did not have any issues at all although my body could have felt the need to sleep more but I was OK with a ton of energy. I don't know exactly what happened recently that I started having kind of brain fog and head heaviness after having poor sleep. I went to the doctor and the blood analysis were OK. I would like to add that I have a deviated septum and I was always sleeping breathing through my mouth. In addition I am person with huge anxiety (diagnosed with OCD) but I was able to sleep well even in was having anxiety attacks.

I started changing my sleep patters to try to fix this issue and know I go to sleep at 00:30 but somehow I wake up at 7:15, but waking up  once during the night and then immediately sleeping. The problem starts later, I feel extremely tired no matter the coffee I take. It is a horrible situation and I am try to convince myself that I will be OK but the anxiety and desperation is increasing because I was not like that before and it is killing me such sleepiness.

I have scheduled an appointment with doctors specialised in sleep to try to overcome such situation because I feel that such sleepiness is not normal. I can feel such sleepiness in my eyes too but If I go some months ago back in the time, I was feeling tired but not with such terrible sleepiness when sleeping less than 7 hours. I have also started meditation two times per day.

Any idea in the meantime?",1,1741330874.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

TL;DR

March 6, 2025

Indian tiktoker/streamer ShaktyG set up his professional streaming equipment in a local coffee shop Bricks & Brew despite the shops policy regarding professional shooting/streaming which was posted upon the entrance of the premises and on their counter. 

The influencer, security guard and administration management got into a heated argument as the influencer refused to acknowledge the compound's policy.

Later that night on his tiktok and Kick live stream, ShaktyG discussed what he experienced and accused the staffs of being aggressive, racist, and ungrateful through fabricated lies and posted continuous questions of why he wasn’t allowed to do his live streaming. He even mentioned that the shop should be “thankful as they needed him to make the shop viral” and “what he did was actually free promotions for the store”. The shop were also targeted by his followers on his live, on Google, and on Facebook with negative reviews even if they haven’t visited the shop yet, and even propagating hate through tagging the shop as the, “racist cafe”.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.

Panchakarma, the cornerstone of Ayurvedic detoxification, is a time-tested therapy designed to cleanse the body, balance the doshas, and rejuvenate overall health. It involves five major procedures—Vamana (emesis), Virechana (purgation), Basti (medicated enema), Nasya (nasal therapy), and Raktamokshana (blood purification). While these therapies work at a profound level to eliminate toxins, **a proper diet plays an equally crucial role in ensuring the success of Panchakarma.**

Many people wonder, **“Is it necessary to follow a diet during Panchakarma?”** The simple answer is **yes**. Panchakarma is not just about undergoing detox therapies; it’s a complete lifestyle reset that requires mindful eating. This blog will delve deep into why a specific diet is essential during Panchakarma, what foods to eat and avoid, and how diet influences the effectiveness of this Ayurvedic cleansing process.

**The Role of Diet in Panchakarma**

Panchakarma aims to **remove toxins (Ama) and restore digestive fire (Agni)**. Without the right dietary support, the body may struggle to fully detoxify, and the benefits of Panchakarma may be diminished. Here’s why diet is crucial:



1. **Prepares the Body for Detoxification** Before starting Panchakarma, the body needs to be in an optimal state to release toxins. A preparatory diet, known as *Snehapana* (internal oleation), involves consuming medicated ghee or oils to loosen toxins from tissues. This step is ineffective if the digestive system is overloaded with heavy, processed foods.
2. **Supports the Body During Detoxification** As the therapies begin, the body undergoes intense cleansing. If improper foods are consumed during this phase, the detox process can be disrupted, leading to digestive discomfort, bloating, or weakness.
3. **Restores Balance After Detox** Panchakarma resets the body, but **post-detox care is crucial**. Eating the right foods ensures that toxins do not accumulate again, and the digestive fire (Agni) remains strong.



**Pre-Panchakarma Diet: Preparing for Detox**

The pre-cleanse phase, or **Purvakarma**, involves preparing the body for Panchakarma through dietary modifications. This typically starts **7-10 days before the therapy** and includes:

**Foods to Eat Before Panchakarma**



* **Light, warm, and easily digestible meals** such as soups, kichari (rice and lentil porridge), and steamed vegetables.
* **Ghee (clarified butter)** to lubricate the digestive tract and help in toxin removal.
* **Herbal teas** like cumin, coriander, and fennel tea to improve digestion.
* **Stewed fruits** like apples and pears to provide natural fiber and antioxidants.
* **Moong dal (yellow lentils)** which are easy to digest and provide protein.



**Foods to Avoid Before Panchakarma**



* **Processed and packaged foods** that burden the digestive system.
* **Heavy meats, fried foods, and dairy products** that slow down detoxification.
* **Caffeine and alcohol**, as they disturb the doshic balance.
* **Refined sugars and artificial sweeteners**, which create more toxins in the body.
* **Cold or refrigerated foods**, as they weaken Agni (digestive fire).



**Diet During Panchakarma: Supporting Detoxification**

During Panchakarma, the digestive system is in a sensitive state, requiring **easily digestible and nourishing** foods to facilitate toxin elimination. The diet should be **simple yet fulfilling** to prevent any strain on the body.

**Recommended Diet During Panchakarma**



1. **Kitchari (Rice and Lentil Porridge)** – The staple diet during Panchakarma, kitchari provides essential nutrients while being easy on digestion.
2. **Steamed Vegetables** – Carrots, beets, zucchini, and leafy greens are recommended.
3. **Warm Herbal Teas** – Ginger, cumin, and coriander tea support digestion.
4. **Homemade Soups** – Lentil soup, vegetable broth, and clear soups provide nourishment without overburdening the stomach.
5. **Ghee** – A small quantity daily helps maintain digestive strength.
6. **Fresh Fruits** – In moderation, apples, pears, and pomegranates support detoxification.
7. **Herbal Spices** – Turmeric, cumin, coriander, and ginger aid digestion.

**Foods to Avoid During Panchakarma**

* **Heavy and oily foods** – They counteract detoxification.
* **Fermented and dairy-based products** – These can create digestive disturbances.
* **Caffeine and Alcohol** – These interfere with body cleansing.
* **Processed Sugar and Refined Carbs** – They generate Ama (toxins).
* **Cold and Raw Foods** – They disturb digestive fire.

**Post-Panchakarma Diet: Maintaining the Benefits**

Once Panchakarma is complete, it is crucial to **gradually reintroduce a balanced diet**. The body is in a purified state, and sudden consumption of heavy or processed foods can reverse the benefits.

**Post-Panchakarma Dietary Guidelines**

1. **Continue Eating Light** – Start with warm, cooked meals before reintroducing heavier foods.
2. **Increase Fiber Intake Gradually** – Include whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables.
3. **Stay Hydrated** – Herbal teas and warm water help maintain digestion.
4. **Include Healthy Fats** – Ghee, coconut oil, and sesame oil nourish the tissues.
5. **Practice Mindful Eating** – Avoid overeating or consuming food in a hurry.
6. **Maintain Regular Eating Timings** – This helps sustain digestive health.

**Foods to Avoid Post-Panchakarma**

* **Junk food, deep-fried foods, and processed items**.
* **Cold drinks, ice creams, and overly spicy foods**.
* **Overeating or binge eating, which can weaken the digestive fire.**

**FAQs About Panchakarma Diet**

**1. Can I eat non-vegetarian food during Panchakarma?**

No, it is advised to avoid meat and heavy proteins as they can slow down digestion and detoxification.

**2. Is fasting necessary before Panchakarma?**

Complete fasting is not necessary, but consuming a **light diet of kitchari and soups** before Panchakarma is recommended.

**3. Can I drink coffee or tea during Panchakarma?**

Caffeine is best avoided as it can disturb doshic balance. Instead, opt for herbal teas like ginger, cumin, and coriander tea.

**4. What happens if I don’t follow the diet during Panchakarma?**

Not following the prescribed diet can hinder detoxification, create digestive issues, and reduce the therapy’s effectiveness.

**Conclusion**

Panchakarma is not just about undergoing detox therapies—it’s a **comprehensive purification process** that requires dietary discipline. A well-planned diet before, during, and after Panchakarma ensures maximum benefits, helping the body eliminate toxins, balance doshas, and restore digestive strength.

By following the right dietary guidelines, you allow Panchakarma to work effectively, ensuring a **lighter, healthier, and rejuvenated you**.

She’s 83, but till November , she just lived up the road from me . I’d go see her every night , chat for a bit , make her coffee for the morning , and ride home to attend to my own life . Wasn’t too stressful . The biggest challenge back then was not letting her stressful and negative talking get to me . 

But in early November she fell. Broke a vertebrae. Blood everywhere. When I got to her house the paramedics were already there .

She was rushed to the emergency room and had surgery . I expected a week or so and then back home .

Nope.

She’s been in and out of ICUs. Then another kind of facility to prepare her for where she is now , a rehabilitation facility.

By the end of this month her 100 days there is up and she’ll be coming to live with me . I’m getting home aides for two shifts a day, so that’s 8 hours . 

I think it will be manageable with that kind of help .  Then she’ll be asleep for the night and the only time I’ll be in demand really will be the gap in between the two shifts.

I never expected this . I imagined that with her good insurance , just as it had been covering everything so far , that she’d just go to a nursing home .

I didn’t understand all the ins and outs of Medicaid and 5 year lookbacks and spenddowns .

But she should have . She was a professor and had a doctor friend who tried to tell her to prepare . She had a lawyer who did her will. I just for some reason assumed she’d have thought things through . Looked into them . Planned a little .

She was old a decade ago and walked with a cane back then . So I wish she’d seen a lawyer and done something like asset protection so she could have gone to a nursing home now instead of this .

But here we are now . I’m hoping it will be fine . Maybe a nice , gradual way to say goodbye . Just take it one day at a time where the goal is her comfort . Try to get as many smiles as I can and minimise whatever pain and discomfort.

I’m overwhelmed by all the paperwork. All her bills and statements have fallen to me , and I’ve never done this sort of thing . I’m actually dyslexic and have other learning disabilities, but I’ve looked around and found no sort of help with this . So it’s fallen to me .

I’m trying to put a positive spin on it all.

I’m hoping to benefit from your experiences and feedback here .

If it matters , I’m 47, work from home. Newly single , which is a good thing . I couldn’t imagine attending to my mom while also being in a relationship. Not the kind I was in, anyway.

Thanks for reading .

You watch what you eat. You exercise. Yet, the scale doesn’t budge, and your metabolism feels slower than a dial-up connection. If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone.

Struggling with **weight loss** isn’t just about vanity—it affects energy, mood, and overall health. This is where [CarboFix comes in](https://theworldhealth.org/carbo-fix-official). It claims to flip your **metabolic switch** using **AMPk activation**, but does it deliver?

We tested it to see if it’s the **best AMPk activating supplement for weight loss** or just another bottle of empty promises. Let’s get into it.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **CarboFix**
* **Category:** **Health & Wellness 🡢 Weight Loss Supplements**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.8/5**

# How CarboFix Works

At its core, **CarboFix activates AMPk**, a key enzyme responsible for **fat metabolism**. Think of AMPk as your body's **internal fat-burning switch**—when turned on, it **tells your body to stop storing fat and start using it for energy**.

Many **AMPk supplements** exist, but **CarboFix uses natural ingredients** like **berberine** and **cinnamon bark** to **naturally activate AMPk for weight loss** without stimulants.

Unlike **traditional fat-burning supplements**, this doesn’t rely on caffeine for a quick fix.

So, is **CarboFix** truly **one of the best supplements to boost metabolism without stimulants**, or is it just well-marketed? Let's analyze the ingredients.

# Key Ingredients & Their Benefits

# 🔹 Berberine HCl (400 mg)

# Personal Experience with CarboFix (From Olivia’s Perspective)

I've known **Olivia** for a few years now. She is a **freelance writer and weekend baker** who’s always juggling deadlines while testing out new bread recipes.

She loves **experimenting with sourdough starters and homemade pastries**, but sitting for long hours while working has made it harder for her to keep her metabolism in check.

After noticing **her energy levels crashing in the afternoons** and dealing with **stubborn weight fluctuations**, she [decided to try CarboFix](https://theworldhealth.org/carbo-fix-official) to see if it could help.

Here’s what she had to say:

*""I’ve never been someone who loves intense workouts, and I’m not about to give up my weekend baking marathons. But I was tired of feeling sluggish by mid-afternoon and frustrated with how my weight seemed to creep up, even though I wasn’t overeating.""*

*""Within the first couple of weeks, I noticed that my energy felt steadier throughout the day. Normally, I'd be craving something sweet around 3 p.m., but I didn’t feel that same urgency. It was easier to go longer between meals without feeling irritable or lightheaded.""*

*""Weight-wise, it wasn’t a dramatic overnight change, but after about six weeks, I noticed I wasn’t holding onto as much bloating, and my clothes fit a little better. My digestion also seemed to improve, which I wasn’t expecting.""*

*""The only drawback? It takes patience. If you’re hoping for instant results, this isn’t that kind of supplement. But if you’re willing to be consistent, it can help your metabolism work more efficiently.""*

Olivia’s verdict? **CarboFix helped her feel more in control of her energy and appetite**, making it easier to balance her love for baking with a healthier metabolism.

1j5hanr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slime/comments/1j5hanr/slime_senpai_review_mountain_air_cozy_coffee_shop/,"Slime Senpai Review (Mountain Air, Cozy Coffee Shop, Grave Dust)!","Slime Senpai has already gotten a lot of positive reviews on this sub, and I completely understand the hype now! My order from Senpai got here a day early, and I'm so excited to have these!

The shipping was quick, and the unboxing experience was great. She included a small mystery slime, stickers, and two candies. I love bonus freebies whenever I order from indie shops, and these were very generous.

I've only ever tried one slime shop before, so I don't have a huge frame of reference for what makes a shop great, but I can tell these are really high-quality.

[A picture of the slimes: Mountain Air, Cozy Coffee Shop, and Grave Dust. Featuring mystery slime.](https://preview.redd.it/j56b7exfi7ne1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=976efa67f6b7696e489464a8e4d0f482c801cf4b)

**Mountain Air** is Senpai's neoprene texture. It's very thick and puffy. It's fun to poke and it feels a bit more solid than other slimes. It's unique and satisfying, both texturally and visually. I keep going back to play with it a bit more. The slime makes some nice pops and clicks while playing with it, too. I'll have to watch out to make sure I don't dry these out too quick from playing with them a lot. The scent for Mountain Air kind of reminds me of cologne or men's deodorant. It's a ""cool"" scent.

**Cozy Coffee Shop** comes in two parts: a thick and glossy slime and a pumice topper. Part of the pumice slime got very stuck to the lid of the container so I can't get 100% of it out but that's not really a big deal. I actually kept these parts separate because the glossy slime is so pretty and satisfying on its own. It's smooth and not sticky at all. In general, I kept expecting to get more stickiness or residue from these slimes but they're very nice and smooth. The pumice is interesting. The texture combined with the coffee scent makes it kind of like playing with a kinetic sand form of coffee grounds. It makes a lot of sizzly sand noises while playing with it. The coffee scent for the Coffee Shop slimes is definitely strong. I don't exactly dislike it, but I do wish more of the creamy notes came through. Since I like both textures on their own, I'll keep the parts separate, especially since they have a combined form in Grave Dust. 

[A picture of Grave Dust before it was combined.](https://preview.redd.it/l30rkyy1n7ne1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=75077ea77f48b13ef36325f5c019095ac6a123e4)

**Grave Dust** is a DIY slime with multiple parts: a white glossy base, a dark gray pumice topper, clay graves, and decorative crow charm + moss. The moss is nice for the assembly and taking a pic, but afterwards I was a little like ""well what do I do with this thing"" LOL. The crow is chilling on my desk now. The clay pieces felt almost like foam before they were mixed in. Once everything is combined, it makes for a very unique texture and I like it a lot! It's both smooth and sandy. Lightly sizzly and poppy. I really like this one! I was pumped to see a spooky slime outside of the Halloween season, and the scent definitely reminds me of Halloween somehow. It makes me think of Halloween Horror Nights or Spirit Halloween. It's a leather and flannel scent, but brings those images to mind. Also when I opened the white part for the first time, it stuck to the lid a little and made a bubble and it was like a cute little ghost popping out.

The free mystery slime is a very light purple glossy slime. To me, it has a kind of floral scent but one of my partners told me the scent reminded them of wine and I kind of get that too. It's a nice bonus, and I'm really loving the glossy texture from this shop.

Overall, this order was absolutely worth it and I would love to try more textures from Senpai!",7,1741329287.0,Slime,0,0.9,False

Without it we would just speed through the entire storyline with nothing left except for monotonous coffee making and the same three quests like in Gpgp.

i was on 2.5 for 1 month, then 5 up until 1 month ago. I started 7.5 because i noticed i started to get hungry after day 3 on the 5mg. i did the 7.5 for 3 weeks, then the 4th shot either malfunctioned (or it was me i have no idea honestly) when i looked down there was 2 incision sites, and i think a little bit went inside, but the rest spilled on me. my side effects have been fine / tolerable until i started the 7.5. the last 3-4 weeks i feel the bad side effects of this medication like nausea headache body pain fatigue.

the doctor told me to wait one whole week to do the next shot, so now that day is tomorrow. idk why, but i feel nervous taking it. i feel like now after a week without the full 7.5, then abruptly starting the 7.5 is going to be scary, as in bad side effects or something negative, since the last month was bad and lots of cramps

side note- my menstrual cycle has been normal / and not normal at times before i started zepbound, but mostly normal. at the same time, within the last few months, my period has not been normal. however i am not sure if that is because of this, or cus i was diagnosed with hpv in january 2025. due to this, im currently having to undergo some ultrasounds but that might be an unrelated issue. i have had some cramp / sharp pain in my lower stomach area, i think its the lower left side when ur looking down, sometimes its random. at the same time, i do a lot of stair master and cardio for 1hr or more about 4-5 times a week. that’s also contributed to my weight loss. i don’t weight train, and i have “ozempic face” now. idk if this is relevant but i’ve also had botox done while on this medication (anyone know of any effects from this?)

these have been my only “concerning” side effects for me. has anyone else gone through this? do you think i should start the 7.5 again tomorrow; or maybe go back to 5mg for a week?

although im 137, i still am not at the healthy weight i want to be at (which is 120). do you think zepbound is safe for people who are at 137lbs and not very obese (like 200+ lbs) like is there even any relevance to the weight you are and the mg you’re on?

idk why but im feeling nervous :( i want to continue this but recently i just haven’t been feeling good. also could be my fault - i have not ate protein at alll the last 3 months, drink a lot less water than when i was on it in 2024, and have a sugary coffee drink i make at home but still so yeah my diet is also poor.

advice pleaseee! and yes i will follow up with my doctor but i want to know if anyone can help. thank you!

For me I have never raised the bar this was the first time I had. So I met this guy we talked for a day and a half ish, I first I asked him out at a grocery store I go to all the time. and then he said he noticed me and would text me I don’t hear anything from him, I go back in there 2 days later and he’s like hey I didn’t get a text back from you and I’m like I think I put in the wrong number and I did so he said he’ll text me and he did he was super nice and we talked about random things and I asked if we should hangout.

he said I’m down and he suggested a bookstore that was close to him and I was like sounds great but before all this he asked if I smoked weed and he said cool me too we continued to make plans and I said I get off work at 7 pm so we can go to either a coffee shop or a bookstore and since the bookstore near him closes early I suggest this other bookstore or this one coffee shop and he said the bookstore that’s closest to him I thought he would choose the one close to me cause it’s near his work too but that’s ok.

I agree when I’m on my way after work he suggests I go to his house and park and we can go together to the store cause the parking is a mess and I was like ok he made fun of my driving but that was cute, we go in the bookstore and he says so what were you planning on getting I was like in my head you wanted to come here but instead I said anything so we are walking around and talking about random stuff and what we read and I didn’t know what to say so I said psychology and manipulation and he made a joke so your a manipulative then and I was like no lol I’m more of someone people take advantage of , I know that was weird but I was super nervous :( 

we talk about that and I ask him a couple questions this goes on for about 3 minutes and he asks out of the blue hey are you hungry and I say yes ish and so we go out there is so many restaurants but he chooses Whole Foods and so we get a salad and he wants to eat it at his place I say ok then he gets super touchy feely on the couch and brushes up against me a lot while we are watching a movie and then when he’s going to set up the food he’s like I hope you don’t mind I’m just touchy like that and I said 
ok and so we are watching and at this point I’m asking all the questions and after 5 minutes he says I’m down if you wanna smoke weed and I said ok and before we go out he’s like I just wanna get this out of the way can I kiss you and I say yeah and then after I say I don’t have that much experience that was my first kiss and so he’s suprised so then we are smoking weed and cuddling outside and he asks when did you turn 18 and I tell him and so he gets cold we go back inside and he says it’s cold can we watch the movie in my bedroom, 

at this point I’m super high, and so we do he gets even more touchy feely and said how do you like your second kiss so then we make out a couple times he goes to the bathroom comes back and makes out again he brush’s his knee near my area and I do his but we both just stop at one point and he checks the movie and when it’ll end in a brief second, after the movie he says well I have to get up early so immna have to kick you out so I’m like ok and so he kisses me and I kiss him and I go home 

next morning I text him good morning he doesn’t reply then at the evening I send him another text like hey I had a good time yesterday would you ever wanna do that again and he reply’s with “Yea me too but rn I’m not at a place to continue anything. I’m sorry but yeah I realized it recently that I need to be focused on improving myself rn and I’ve got a lot going on. Agian sorry I realize it probably doesn’t make sense but it’s just complicated for me rn” and I’m like yeah don’t apologize I really hope the best for you, also I’m a regular so it’s been 4 days I go today he sees me and I avoid him and he goes to the back judging from this situation what happened was it me was I not pretty enough, was I too awkward am I just not worth it and he’ll definitely never want anything with me ever again right?",1,1741328494.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

I completed about 70% of U-World Step 1 and had around a 55% average. 



My path was definitely not the average. I was studying for Step 1 in 2023 when my school said I had to start my 3rd year clinical without Step 1. 

Thank God I passed all my rotation Shelf exams and decided to take Step 2 first. I studied for Step 2 for around 5 months and passed.

Then studied for Step 1 for about 2 months after and passed. I will say having Step 2 under my belt definitely helped with diagnosing. There is much overlap between both all exams, shelf, step 1, and step 2. As well having the experience of sitting for Step 2 being 9 hours prepared me for Step 1 which is 8 hours. 



My advice and what worked for me:

I study using Pomodoro method (30 min studying 5-10 min break or 1 hour study 10-15 min break) and use the Forest app. I averaged studying 3-5 hours of focused (no phone or distraction) daily. I took some days off and tried to get steps or gym in. 

For the practice exams and the actual exam I did my best to do two blocks at a time and chunked questions into 10 questions in 15 minutes. This helped me stay on pace and take the exam in chunks. I used essential oils to study and for the exam. I would do Wim Hof Breathing 3-4 rounds before every practice exam and exam. I wore compression socks to get more blood flow.

Day before exam I was just reviewing NBME form that I completed days before and read part of the First Aid Rapid Review. I continued this on the morning of the exam for 2 hours before the exam ( I personally need my brain to get going). I brought nice lunch, caffeine, essential oils, Moxe nasal, dark chocolate, bobo's, and ginger candies. I also brought eye drops and Tylenol in case I got a headache. 

I also use brain supplements called nootropics from Onnit Labs (Alpha Brain for most study days and Black Label for practice exams and exams). If you venture into the nootropic world make sure you are not already taking any stimulant medications (just my recommendation). I would take two alpha brain and drink 3-4 cups of coffee on study days. On practice exam and exam days I would still just drink 3-4 cups of coffee however the Black Label I would take 3 pills out of the 4 pill dose. I found this to be enough. If I needed an extra boost I would take the last one. As well I would and make sure I got my daily green drink in and vitamins

Whoever reads this I hope this helps, I am always praying for this world and hope we all pass and help this world as much as possible. Believe in yourself and trust your gut (the second brain) also we have made it this far the knowledge is somewhere in your head! Best of luck and never give up.",5,1741328492.0,step1,0,0.86,False

1j5h2n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1j5h2n2/less_anxiety/,Less Anxiety,"I’ve only been on Zep for 3 weeks, taking my fourth shot tomorrow. Absolutely love how my entire way of thinking surrounding food has changed. But something else I noticed this week is how much calmer my anxiety has been. I am very sensitive to caffeine. Any amount of caffeine is a major trigger for physical symptoms (hyperventilation/air hunger, palpitations, shaking) and very loud mental anguish. So I avoid it. But I love coffee, so decaf it is (too much decaf and even a lot of dark chocolate can trigger my anxiety too). 

This week, I noticed I’ve felt so much calmer since starting zep. I realized I had some half decaf coffee kcups (I like to torture myself once in a while and see if caffeine still hates me) and I’ve been having one half decaf cup of coffee per day, all week. And… nothing. No palpitations. No shakes. Best of all no air hunger/hyperventilating. None at all. And im super focused at work! Energized but not jittery. I’m still anxious but not overwhelmingly so (for the most part). I definitely have plenty to feel anxious about lately!

I’ve heard that decreased anxiety could be another bonus of Zep and I am just so thankful for this med and all the ways it’s already helping me, even though I’m still in the beginning.",4,1741328389.0,Zepbound,3,1.0,False
