She didn’t let go for a long while, and when she did, he felt strange. He could see she had cried, but she quickly wiped her tears.  “Okay, there is a ship. How long has it been here?” 

He wanted to ask her about the tears, but she was clearly in business mode. “Ship! How long has the ship been here?”

The answer popped up. ‘Unknown. Between two months and a hundred years. Most likely less than five years.’

“Why is it so difficult to estimate the time?” He asked, and the answer popped up.

‘The ship is located in the middle of the desert, there is no trace of the original crash or impact, and the ship appears to have been hidden under sand. The dry environment has also protected it from some corrosion. The time it has spent buried has both protected and harmed the vessel, making it difficult from this distance to gain an accurate estimate of the ship's crash.’

“Is the air breathable there?”

‘Yes, the air is breathable in that area.’

He turned to Kiko. “So, how are we getting there? That’s 9560 kilometers away, the ship won't fly now.”

“What about the speeders? They should be able to travel that distance.  We would need to recharge when we get there, though.” She replied.

“Are you crazy? At full speed, we are talking two days.  You want to fly over this land on a sports speeder?  They can barely carry anything too.”

“So we are just going to leave it? there might be something there we can use. Alloys we can't make on this planet.  I know it's dangerous, but are we just going to stay inside the ship until it's fixed? That might take years.”

“Okay. I’ll go. I’d like the scooters together so I can put a container between them. It won't look nice, but it will work, and I won't be able to go full speed. It might take a week.”

“You're not leaving me alone here for a week! I’m coming with you.”

“Oh, so we are both going to die out there?” he replied.

“Are you planning to die out there?” She replied.

“No, of course not.”

“Neither am I. Just give up. We are going, so let's start working. I saw there were a few empty containers in the back. We can use one of them.”

He thought about it, he could take the hover modules off the scooters, put them under the container, and link them to the scooters. They should be able to pull them, and the scooters should be at least 500 meters above ground. They only had to land to sleep and recharge the engines. They should be able to drive at least 700 kilometers a day like that. That meant about fourteen days each way, they would need to add an extra layer of ice and gas for that period.  He guessed he would need at least a week to get it fixed. Shed was looking at him now with a smile.

“What?”

“I can see that you're thinking about a solution, that marvelous brain of yours is working overtime now.”

“Yes, I can do it, but it will take at least a week to get it ready, and the speed of the scooters will be drastically reduced. I’m lucky if I can get to a quarter of their speed.”

“What's their top speed? 300 kilometers an hour?” she asked.

“Around that, yeah, I would guess a week each way, so we have to secure the ship better just in case.”

“You work on the scooters, I secure the ship, and let me know if there is anything I can do to help you, right? I’ll have the satellite start searching for more wrecks, that unstable wormhole might have sent a few here.”

“That might be a good idea.  Who knows what else that wormhole has snatched up?  Now that I think about it, the only reason we survived the landing was the third redundant system we installed. If we didn’t, then we would be free-falling from the atmosphere.”

“Shit, I didn't know that.” She replied, shocked. “You mean the only reason we are alive is your paranoid captain?”

“He wasn’t paranoid, just had a phobia about being stranded in deep space.” He replied.

“Well, I’m glad he did.  I’m surprised he didn’t have a shuttle installed. “

“We had three, he sold two to cover his debt, and the last was lost during the attack.” She got up and kissed him.

“Go work, and I will do my thing. Keep the line open.”  Then she vanished down the hall to the cockpit. He smiled a bit before heading to the cargo room and taking out the scooters. He started examining them, went to the workbench, and brought up their designs.  

He needed to boost the already installed gravity generators on the large container. It was five meters long, three meters wide, and two and a half meters high.  They would need her generator inside to boost the power as well, so he started to work on setting it up. He started working; he needed to get the main generator on the engine back online before he could finish here.

“Peter? Can you come up here?” He stopped working and looked at his watch. He had been working for seven hours, and he could stop here without risking damaging anything.

“Sure, on my way. Anything serious?” He asked as he got ready and made his way to the cockpit.

“You will see.” She said, and he moved a little too fast and soon came up to the kitchen, where she was watching the big screen, seeing new images from the drone. He looked at the image, which showed a sail ship, and the drone had zoomed in on the crew.

“That’s a Fushan and Jobar crew. What the hell?”

“Yeah, so now we have four species here. They are pretty far out, too. Closer to the mainland.” She said as she brought up the world map. They had landed on a large peninsula, only connected to the mainland by a thin strip of land. Then she switched to another picture of the said peninsula-mainland connection, where somebody had built a huge wall.

“There is so much stuff here. The scanners missed most of it. It seems like it was only focused on technology. That wall is either to keep others from reaching this place or to keep them from going to the mainland.” She said, as she put a cup of coffee in his hand. He looked at it and took a sip.

“You'd better be careful, if this becomes a habit, I might propose.”

She just grinned before continuing.

“Anyway. I’m not risking the drone to go further away, I’m just glad the camera is so damn good.  If we can find enough to repair the other drone, then we could actually do some more investigations. Oh, and… “she changed it to the camera outside the cave. The camp was there, but nobody was left. “The weed is gone!”

“Good, did you track them?”

“Of course. What do you take me for?  They live at the base of the mountain on the northern side. It seems like that’s the area where the gas is going to. I have stopped the release of the gas for now, not that they will notice. If we double the ice wall and blast a hole four hundred meters out west wall, there is a fifty-meter drop at the entrance to get in. We can collapse the tunnel for about a hundred meters. I doubt they can dig that long just to check.”

“Yeah, that can work. There is one problem.  The scooters won’t be able to provide enough energy, so we have to take your generator.”

“My generator?” she looked at him and laughed.  “You can take it.”

“Yeah, I will, but if I take it now before the ship's generator is fixed, then the ship will only have the battery left, and that’s only two weeks on emergency power.”

“So, how long until the generator is fixed?”

“I have to check, but about a week, so not that bad. I’m actually almost finished. That container already had anti-gravity systems, but they could only lift about ten meters. I’m boosting them now to five hundred by using parts from the other scooters.”

“How did you learn that?”

“Back home, worked on scooters and shuttles all the time as a teen. I could probably build a shuttle if I got hold of the correct parts.” He said as he sipped his coffee and then looked at the fridge. “Okay, I’ll make us dinner.”

“No, you don’t, you sit, and I'll do that.” She said as she opened the fridge, took out some ingredients, put them in the food fabricator, and started it. He just watched with a smile.

“What are you after?”

She just winked.

The next day, he finished the construction, and without the extra energy, he raised it ten meters with ease, before parking it.  Then he went to check on the repair progress and saw what materials they were missing. He was thinking of cannibalizing part of the ship to supply it when the droids returned with the first load of mined resources. Kiko was going through the ship and making a proper inventory list, and by the look of it, the ship was filled with forgotten treasures and mementoes, as well as lots of crap.

He made Kiko dinner from scratch the same day, she watched him like he was doing something mysterious.  

The next day, they went through the others' cabins and packed away their personal belongings. She was surprised by the number of weapons they found. Peter was sure there was more hidden somewhere. He had not revealed his one hidden stash.  They moved into the cabin that night and left two days later as the alarm went off. The engine room was safe enough to start the power generator; however, the AI warned about takeoff.  

 

When they turned on the ship's power generator, the ship immediately seemed more alive; several system that had been turned off was turned on, the ship's self-cleaning program immediately turned on and started to clean the interior. Kiko laughed as she saw it.

“Are you serious? You guys installed a cleaning program? Is that lavender I smell? Oh, my god. Some hardcore criminals, you guys are!”

“Hey, just because we are hardcore doesn’t mean we can't enjoy some luxury!” he replied.

Peter started the process of disconnecting the smaller generator and connected it to the containers ' antigrav engines.

An hour later, they had transferred the generator, and Kiko helped move in some camping equipment, an oxygen generator, and food for the trip.  He helped her into a space suit that had belonged to Maya.

She was about to say something when she noticed something about the suits.

“This is military grade. They can really take a beating.”

“Yes, I need to keep you protected. Anyway, there is a pistol at your leg, a dagger hidden at your leg, and a tool kit on your left leg. Not a big one. We stay on channel two for good luck. Ready?”

“Yes sir! Don’t worry, I know how to use a suit.” She replied as she tried to hit his butt.

He just smiled and helped her up on the scooter before going up on his own. “They are linked, so for this part, you can just relax. I will take the first stretch.”

They flew down the tunnel they had made, and halfway through, some parts collapsed behind them before they blasted open the last part and flew out.

It was still day as they started their road trip.

1pjw8x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pjw8x7/after_4_years_of_building_in_silence_im_finally/,"After 4 years of building in silence, I'm finally ready to show off my vocabulary app (4.7★, 16 languages) - Need your honest feedback","[VocArt's screen recording](https://reddit.com/link/1pjw8x7/video/puhd5r1lik6g1/player)

Hey everyone,  
I'm Christopher and I need to come clean about something: I've been building VocArt for 4 years but I've been absolutely terrible at marketing it. Like, developer-level terrible. I finally decided to stop hiding and start doing this right, so I'm treating this as a fresh start and hoping you'll help me pick a right way.

👉 What is VocArt?  
It's a vocabulary learning app where you explore beautiful illustrated scenes and tap on objects to learn words in 16 languages. Think interactive picture dictionary meets art gallery. You see a cozy kitchen scene, tap on the coffee maker, and instantly learn the word in Spanish, Japanese, Arabic - whatever you're learning - with pronunciation audio, romanization, and grammar info.

👉 The honest backstory:  
I built this thing completely solo (except for the gorgeous illustrations from artists in Vietnam, Turkey, and Indonesia). Launched 4 years ago. Got it to 4.7-4.9 stars on both stores. Even got featured in Vietnam once and hit 15K users briefly.

But here's the thing - I'm a developer, not a marketer. I ran out of money for ads. I started an Instagram that went nowhere. I've been stuck at \~1K monthly users for way too long while I kept adding features instead of telling people the app exists.

👉 I'm running out of energy to keep this going alone.  
So I'm doing what I should have done years ago: actually talking to people, asking for feedback, and learning how to market properly. I'm treating this as a relaunch. A fresh start.

👉 What's in the app right now:  
\- 3 artwork themes (Food & Kitchen, Holidays & Travels, House) with 10 chapters each  
\- 16 languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Ukrainian  
\- Tap-to-learn tooltips with translations, romanization, articles/gender  
\- High-quality pronunciation audio (paid feature at $2.99)  
\- Progress tracking with color-coded markers  
\- Offline-friendly  
\- Beautiful landscape dual-panel navigation

👉 What's coming in v4.0 (soon):  
\- Switching to subscription model (more sustainable)  
\- New ""Phrases & Expressions"" artwork  
\- Simple challenges/missions to make learning more engaging (might come bit later)  
\- More languages

👉 Why I think it's actually good:  
\- 4.7 stars on App Store & Google Play (almost 1k ratings)  
\- People who find it genuinely love it  
\- Perfect for visual learners and beginners  
\- No overwhelming drills - just explore at your own pace

👉 What I need from you:  
I'm not here to just promote. I genuinely want your honest feedback:  
\- If you try it, what feels off? What's confusing?  
\- What would make you actually use this daily?  
\- Am I positioning this wrong? A ""picture dictionary"" is the keyword that describes it best but not tracking much traffic.  
\- What is missing that would make this a must-have for language learners?

I know there are a million language apps out there. But I believe the art-first, zero-pressure approach has real value. I just need help figuring out how to reach the people who would actually love it.

👉 Try it if you're curious:  
VocArt download link for iOS/Android: ([https://vocart.app/download/](https://vocart.app/download/))

And if you have any advice on marketing, growth, or just... not giving up, I'm all ears. Because right now I'm at that crossroads where I either figure this out or watch 4 years of work fade away.

Thanks for reading this far. Really appreciate any feedback you can share.

P.S.  
\- I'm also looking for a marketing partner or co-founder if anyone's interested, but that's a whole other post😅",1,1765455932.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

I’m doing PG, she’s working. she recently (2d ago) moved out from her company quarters to new society, so i can visit during weekends and chill.

actually after a crazy road rage, another crazy thing happened.

aa road rage trwtha, we stopped at a coffee shop, took some time to process that then we thought of skipping road trip and decided to go for Dhurandhar. oka ~20KM ride chesi movie chusi we returned back around 10’00 PM.

actually scene enti ante, like I’ve mentioned she shifted to this house just 2-3 days ago, I live like 60KM away and visit during weekends to her place. present ee new house lo painting and plumbing work jaruguthu undedi, we packed all our things and left while the work is gng on in the home (my gf’s manager vouched for the contractor, also we don’t have any precious things, so we left while these 2 guys are working at home) which we realised later that we shouldn’t have. 🫠
when we stopped at the cafe, I got this notification from Find My that my airpods were left behind, I was sure that I have packed it in my bag so I didn’t worry at all. return ochesaka, we had dinner and slept.

nxt morning I woke up at 6AM, bcos I have to catch this local train that departs at 6’30AM.
lecha, fresh ayya, bag eskuni shoes eskuni, airpods kosam chuste levu, yekdo intlone petti marchipoyunta, find my open chesi play sound kodadam ani open cheste last location 6km away 6h ago ani chupinchindi, that’s it, mind fuck naku. aa location yekda ani chuste that wasn’t in our yesterday’s route also i didn’t carry it yesterday so i came to realise that these guys robbed but I cannot prove/accuse them bcos my gf has to live at this place and also it’s obvious that the person who stole won’t admit that he stole and return back the stolen item so I thought like raasi petti ledhu but oksari aa last location ki velli chuddama anipinchindi, but I cannot miss my train, after some thinking i decided to go search for airpods since they value so much and i bought them just 3mo back and i just can’t literally survive without them.

nenu thanu inka start ayyem, start ayye apdu pitch dark undedi bhyta eventhough it’s 6’10AM, also so f freezing (agency area), aa last location ki velli chuste em ledhu akkada, chinna resort (peru ki resort but more like a motel) and gates locked. call cheddam ante num ledhu board medha. so i tress-passed and went to the exact location but there’s nothing, i lost hope and went back to where I parked my bike. I made peace and decided to go back to home but I opened “find my” app and tapped on “notify when found” and also opened directions and gave it to my gf to hold while on our way back home. while we were gng back, my phone beeped and showed me this notification that they’re near, I instantly applied brakes and stopped and checked the location it showed just beside us (now), my gf went to that home, talked to the lady, she went inside called her husband, he came, we asked about those two painters, he said he didn’t know, i tried playing sound but it wasn’t connected. then I thought like maybe I’ve covered some distance when applying brakes, so i tapped on directions and went back walking then it showed “far” and “connected” that’s it….fuckkk!! then I looked around and there’s one room right to the road, I got down and moved forward to that room, then jt got disonnected but when I came back to the room it was getting connected, I called my gf and informed the same, she came screaming and said that she gave details of how those two painters look to the other home we went earlier and they said that one of those painter lives in the exact same room i was roaming around, we went to the door and I played sound and I can hear my airpods beeping from inside 😭😭😭.
my gf knocked on the door, his wife opened, 

my gf - Sorry for disturbing! yesterday, ur hubby came to paint our home. mistakenly, our device might have slipped into his bag. location is showing to ur home on our phone and u can hear the beeping of the device from inside, that’s ours, can you please return it.

(his wife called him)
he came, looked at us, shocked. couldn’t speak, said ba ba ba, nothing else. her wife explained the situation to him, he went inside, got his bag, picked my APP from his bag (I kept playing sound continously) handed it over to us, his wife shocked (I think she understood what just happened), we rocked. went back to the previous home we went first, thanked them. they talked with us for 5 good minutes, exchanged numbers, offered us chai, but we were really happy we said no, thank you. returned back, took a pic to remember this memory. 

TL DR - lost airpods during house work (painter stole), made peace that I can’t find them again (cannot accuse them as I’m non local) , used find my, went to last seen location, did some digging, found.

I went to my gyno about 3 years ago and she wanted to do some testing one was a fasting glucose/insulin test. I had to drink a sugary drink and get labs done every 30 mins for 2 hours. After that she suspected insulin resistance as glucose was stable but insulin was high. She started me on strict keto and I did that for about a year but my weight went from 120lbs to 105lbs and I told her if I stuck with the diet I was worried id lose more weight (saying I wasn't overweight to begin with) and she told me let's reintroduce carbs again. So okay perfect. She ended up leaving the area and the next gyno said ""youre to young for diabetes"" and brushed it off. Okay cool. Will add ive never taken any medicine just a change in diet. For the past year of my life ive ate pretty much anything ive wanted 😅 I m now about 120-125 ishlbs so back to my normal weight. I also have Lupus and POTS as well as some other issues like chronic migraines seizures those kinds of things I do take a lot of other medications. At my last rheumatologist appointment for my lupus he did some labs and my glucose was 56. Which is very low. It struck me funny because my labs were done about 2pm and around noon I had a sandwhich and a small bag of chips so I had carbs and it was still very low! When I brought it up to the rheumatologist he said the same ""probably a fluke youre to young for diabetes"" so I broke out my finger poke blood sugar machine that I was using back with the insulin resistance keto diet time of my life and started testing. Still eating quite average. I do use sugar free coffee creamer no extra added lkke table sugar just SF creamer and I have 1 cup in the morning the rest of the day is straight water as my POTS I need to hit at least 64oz of water a day. I dont drink juice milk or soda. I do eat fairly healthy as is but I did go back to eating like pasta and breads but km not a huge sweets person and my drink is always water besides that one cup of coffee in the morning. Now with my finger poke machine im always in a good area for fasting levels in the morning and even with eating pasta or something the highest ive caught a ""spike"" is 125. But the other morning I had my cup of coffee sugar free creamer then I made 3 hard boiled eggs for my breakfast-I do this just about every day- and about an hour after I started to feel like crap so I was like hmm wonder what my sugar is.. 58. So im now noticing issues where its going quite low. Im going to be making an appointment with my primary and hopefully she'll have some advice as the other two doctors brushed it off and said im to young for diabetes.. but can anyone give insight on why its dropping so low? Even with my somewhat healthy eating choices? I was assuming it was maybe high but most time I test it its like 80-50 something and the lows are having me concerned!

My dear father pulls me into his room to show me his loot he frantically went and found. Easily over 300$ worth of items for my stepmother and he was worried about it not being good enough.. It’s just sad man. I’d hate to burst their bubble cause it does seem to bring them some sort of joy to buy things for people so I bite my tongue a lot of the timebut I’m tired of this kind of Christmas being normalized and I’m sick of feeling like the outsider whenever I do express how I feel about gifts.

I love Christmas with my son, I’ll buy him a couple of gifts and fill his stocking. I’ll decorate and do some baking. We’re going to Christmas Eve Mass just the two of us which is something I’m really looking forward too this year.

I’ve tried for years to be happy with consumer Christmas but it just doesn’t sit right with me. I just can’t fake it anymore so I’m throwing up some boundaries.

I hope a nice calming Christmas Eve will help balance out the craziness of Christmas Day at my parents house.

I’ll brace for all the gifts shoved onto my lap, making them feel validated with the “wowww thank you !!”

The guilt I will feel that I didn’t spend more money on more gifts for them will eventually rub me the wrong way and I’ll disassociate but Hey ! It’s Christmas! The coffee and alcohol will be flowing.

Hopefully it will be just enough numbing to take the edge off so I try and focus on the moment and not all of this junk. Try not to notice the phone camera shoved in my face, all the pictures being taken for even MORE validation from random people on my stepmothers Facebook.

1. I drink Instant coffee twice a day (6AM, 1PM)
2. I consume about 1 tbsp in one go.
3. I experiment a lot with instant coffee, have tried many flavours; currently I have settled on Nescafe Alta Rica

I want to step up my coffee game and move to freshly brewed coffee. I am looking at buying Hibrew H10A + G5 grinder. Costs around \~40k 

I have had some issues with caffeine in the past, If I consume 2 espresso shots in one go I have a high risk of triggering vertigo. Basically my head spins for next 2 days :P

Question;

1. I heard that we can only effectively brew double shots ? I can NOT consume both in one go due to vertigo :( and I dont want to waste coffee.
2. Is there a way to just brew good single shots ?
3. If not, are there good (and cheap) decaf beans available in India ? I could find a few options but at almost 2X the price of normal beans.
4. Is espresso really that much better than instant coffee ? (specially 100% arabica such as nescafe alta rica)

**Synopsis:**  
Following the chilling discovery by Dr. Haruka Takahashi at the KAGRA observatory, the silence of the cosmos has been broken not by a greeting, but by a gunshot. Now, the evidence must be presented to a skeptical world. In the halls of the UN, the fate of humanity will be decided, and a desperate plan will be born. But a plan needs builders. Across the globe, five special scients are about to receive a call that will change their lives—and end their world as they know it.

# Chapter 4 The Sentence of an Inevitable Truth

“*A man does what he ought to do, regardless of the personal consequences, regardless of the obstacles, dangers, and*  
*pressures, and that is the basis of human morality.”*  
—Winston Churchill  
  
  
The influence of Dr. Tanaka and Professor Ishida, combined with the reputation of Haruka’s parents, secured access to the JWST in record time. Two weeks later, after the three of them had verified and double-checked the data, some of the most influential scientific minds on the planet took their seats.  


There would be no colorful remarks or pleasantries: only the evidence.  


The meeting was tense from the start. Haruka faced them: the same minds who shaped humanity’s understanding of the universe, gathered with unprecedented urgency. Some looked irritated, others merely curious. After the brief, obligatory pleasantries, she began her presentation, making the urgency of the matter unmistakable.  


“And here,” Haruka concluded after an hour and a half of presentation, while the JWST images showed the intricate geometric patterns of residual heat around HD 40307 and the infrared and Doppler-shift signature of the projectile on a direct vector to Earth, “you have the only plausible explanation for the energy required to generate that gravitational pulse: a Dyson sphere, or something very much like it.”



No one spoke. Only the soft hum of the projector filled the room.



Haruka set the remote on the table and sat down, suddenly aware of how exhausted she was. She studied the faces before her, one by one: disbelief, fear, denial. She took a sip of water and waited. For the moment, her part was done.

  
Dr. Aris Thorne, a renowned British astrobiologist, was the first to break the silence. His accent frayed under the strain.

  
“Dr. Takahashi... what you’re suggesting is... monumental. Are you absolutely certain there is no natural explanation for that geometric infrared signature? Some atypical protoplanetary disk, perhaps?”

  
Ben Carter, the famous American astroengineer, still processing the implications, leaned forward.

“So, we’re saying we’ve been detected by a Type II or III civilization on the Kardashev \[1\] scale, and their response was... to shoot us?”

  
“I’m afraid all the evidence points in that direction, however improbable it sounds, Ben-san,” Tanaka replied. He knew Carter from their work together at the Kakuda Space Center, where Carter had served as an external consultant.  


Dr. Jian Li, a Canadian physicist and engineer of Chinese descent, continued the assault, sharp and precise.



“Or we’re chasing ghosts,” he said. “A complex artifact. A subtle instrumental bias. Have we absolutely ruled out residual misalignments in JWST’s optics after the maneuver? Unknown subatomic interference? Before we invoke alien megastructures, we must exhaust every known physical and instrumental explanation.”  


  
At that moment, Professor Ishida Matsuoka, an elderly Japanese astronomer whose meticulousness and almost legendary skepticism were as solid as KAGRA’s foundations, spoke up. Decades earlier, he had pioneered the use of neural networks to filter noise from faint astrophysical signals. He was known for his reserve; when he chose to speak, the scientific community listened.  




“We have modeled every natural scenario and every plausible failure mode—even the absurd ones, Dr. Thorne, Dr. Li,” he said calmly. “The AIs have run exhaustive diagnostics on both instrumentation and data, in parallel with our own checks. The temperature distribution, the geometry, the absence of significant gas or dust… none of it matches any known disk model. It does, however, align—disturbingly well—with theoretical models of large-scale artificial structures and their unavoidable thermal leakage. And we have the Doppler-based triangulation that led us to the JWST images of the ‘projectile’.”  


 

“What about the gravitational pulse?” asked Dr. Lena Petrova, the general relativity specialist. “The energy involved… If your calculations hold, we’re talking about a significant fraction of a K-type star’s total output released in a short burst. For propulsion. That implies accelerating a substantial mass to relativistic speeds.”  


   
“Hostile alien life,” Thorne whispered, his face drained of color. “I’ve always supported the idea that other civilizations must exist out there, but to see it confirmed like this…”  


  
Ben Carter ran a hand over his face; his usual confidence had fractured.  
  
  
“I don’t think you’re grasping the scale,” he said hoarsely. He typed on the console and projected an image of Mars and its moons onto the central screen.  
  
  
“That’s Phobos—twenty-two kilometers across\[2\] Now picture something of similar size with ten times the mass. To compress something in the order of 10^(17) kilograms into that volume, you need a density that’s… obscene. That object isn’t porous rock. It’s compact metal. As compact as it gets. And it’s moving at seventy percent of the speed of light.”  
  
  
A deathly silence fell over the room as the image sank into their minds. The idea of taking Mars's largest moon, multiplying its mass by ten, and launching it across the solar system like a bullet at 70% the speed of light turned the problem from a terrifying abstraction into a physical, tangible, and insurmountable reality. It was at that moment that terror truly took hold.  
  
  
“The evidence leads unequivocally in that direction, Ben-san,” Haruka said firmly. “The data also supports your estimate: a projectile roughly twenty to twenty-five kilometers across, with a mass on the order of 10^(17) kilograms—about ten times the mass of Phobos. The gravitational pulse was the muzzle flash, racing ahead at light speed. The projectile itself follows more slowly, but not by much.”  
  
  
“Estimated time of arrival?” Lena Petrova asked, her voice faint.  
  
  
“The launch must have taken place around 1993,” Haruka said, lowering her voice. “The gravitational wave travels at light speed; we detected it forty-two years later. Using the distance to HD 40307, the observed energy, and the arrival-time differences at the three observatories… we have eighteen years. Specifically, 2053.”

   
The room absorbed the sentence.

  
Eighteen years. Not even two decades. A blink of an eye in cosmic time. A desperately short countdown.  


Fear thickened the air, settling over them like the silence.

   
“Eighteen years?” Thorne repeated, incredulous. “Impossible...”

   
“Any chance of defense?” Petrova asked, barely above a whisper.  


 Everyone already knew the answer. Haruka shook her head.

   
“Against an object of that mass, traveling at seventy percent of the speed of light, no technology we possess—or could plausibly develop in eighteen years—can stop it or meaningfully deflect it,” she said. “The impact will sterilize the Earth.”



The consensus came quickly and without dissent: the world leaders had to be informed. There was no time to waste. Every person in that room carried significant scientific and political weight; within hours they began pulling the necessary strings to convene an emergency session of the UN Security Council within the week. That same day, Haruka and Drs. Ishida and Tanaka boarded a flight to New York, headquarters of the Security Council.

 

During the flight, Haruka finally slept, crushed by weeks of strain. Her rest was broken by visions of fire, unbearable white light, and a frantic search for something she could not name and could not find.

   
  
A week later, they stood before a hall of world dignitaries in the UN Security Council chamber. The atmosphere was a charged mix of disbelief and brittle tension. Haruka, flanked by Aris Thorne and Lena Petrova, had just finished her presentation. The faces of presidents, prime ministers, and ambassadors were masks of astonishment, denial, and dawning horror. In scarcely seven days, the world had shifted from scientific wonder to diplomatic panic.

   
“Dr. Takahashi,” began the President of the United States, her voice thick with disbelief as she removed her glasses and pinched the bridge of her nose, “are you telling us, unequivocally, that an alien civilization has fired an interstellar weapon at us and is going to destroy our planet?”  


“Yes, Madam President,” Haruka replied calmly. “That is the inescapable conclusion from the data.”

  
“This is absurd!” the Russian ambassador exploded. “Gravitational waves? Dubious infrared images? It could be anything! Perhaps a plot to divert global resources!”

  
“Ambassador,” Dr. Petrova cut in, her tone glacial, “the data have been independently verified by the world’s leading physics and astronomy institutes, including those in your own country. The evidence is irrefutable. The conclusions, however terrifying, are logical.”

  
“But... eighteen years?” asked the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the figure itself seeming unreal. “Good Lord! So little time? Is there nothing we can do? Any planetary defense? Have we consulted the AGI?”

  
“The AGI network has analyzed the data and confirms both our interpretation and the timeline,” Haruka said. “Eighteen years. 2053. As for defense… the kinetic energy of such an object is orders of magnitude beyond anything we can generate or withstand. Attempting to intercept it would be like trying to stop a tsunami with an umbrella. The only viable strategy is not defense, but…”

  
“What, Doctor?” pressed the German Chancellor, leaning toward the microphone, brows knitted.

  
“Post-impact survival,” Haruka said.



A beat of stunned silence.



“The extinction of complex life on Earth is, under these conditions, a mathematical certainty.”



A low murmur of panic and despair swept through the chamber: muffled exclamations, whispered curses, the scrape of chairs. The brutality of the deadline made everything feel unreal—and far more terrifying.



“We can’t just give up,” the French President protested, rising to his feet. “There must be another option!”



“There isn’t,” Haruka said, with a coldness that surprised even her. “Not for us. Not for Earth as we know it. Accepting this reality—and the urgency of our deadline—is the first necessary step. However, extinction does not have to mean the end of humanity.”



She signaled to her aides, who moved through the room, distributing thick sealed dossiers. For a brief moment she wished with all her being, that she was wrong.



“What you now hold in your hands,” she continued, as the seal stamped on the covers became visible,

  
**PROJECT ARK — OMEGA LEVEL AUTHORIZATION**

***Ref.: MU-TH-UR/182-Ω***

 

“Is not a plan for salvation. It is a plan for resurrection. A blueprint to encode our knowledge, our biology, and our culture so they can survive the impact and be reborn when the Earth heals.”



She met the eyes of the assembled dignitaries with a resolve she had never felt before.



“We have eighteen years. We must begin today. Eighteen years to build this Ark. Eighteen years for the most monumental task in our history. The work must begin now. There is no room for doubt or delay. The alternative is the absolute extinction of our species.”



The maneki-neko mug still sat on her desk at KAGRA—a small talisman of luck in a world that had just discovered its fortune had run out, and that the time remaining was shorter than anyone had dared imagine. But in Haruka Takahashi’s eyes there was no longer fear, only the iron resolve of someone who stares into the abyss and chooses to build a bridge across it, knowing she will never set foot on the other side.



The distant place had called. And the high bridge had begun to rise, in a desperate race against time.



In the KAGRA control room, the impact timer was set: ***18 years, 0 months, 0 days.***

# Chapter 5: The Club of the Condemned to Live

   
*“Duty is as heavy as a mountain; death, as light as a feather.”*   
—Samurai proverb (quoted by Yukio Mishima)

  
**\[Year 2036 — 17 years to impact\]**

 

Project ARK, born from Dr. Haruka Takahashi’s terrifying revelation, was not merely an engineering and scientific endeavor; it was a desperate search for the most capable and, perhaps, most resilient minds Earth could offer. As the project’s global machinery began to move, a discreet network was woven in the shadows to recruit the few who would bear the weight of the future. For them, news of the coming cataclysm would arrive before it reached the rest of the world. And their acceptance or rejection would mark the first link in the chain of survival.

 

**\[Cambridge, United Kingdom\]**

The smell of ozone and cold coffee defined the atmosphere inside the laboratory. The damp Cambridge night clung to the glass windows. The bluish glow of the flow cytometer bathed Dr. Khamala Ahmed’s focused face. She was studying the response of neural stem cells to a new generation of repair nanobots she herself had designed. On the walls of the Cambridge Institute for Regenerative Medicine, projected biochemical pathways formed constellations of light and purpose.

 

At thirty-two, Khamala was a force of nature: rigorous, brilliant, skeptical of anything that could not be proven with data. She had achieved partial reversal of ischemic damage in cultured brain tissue—a milestone. The future of medicine, she thought, was bright.

 

Until the coded message arrived: an urgent appointment with Sir Alistair Finch, the government’s chief scientific advisor. No details. No protocol. The meeting, held in an anonymous room in Whitehall, was brief. Sir Alistair wasted no time on preliminaries: he showed her the JWST data, the gravitational signal detected by KAGRA, the simulations. Khamala reviewed them with impassive attention.

 

“Signal contamination? Optical artifacts? Gravitational lensing? Was the Takahashi Filter calibration verified by independent teams with access to the source code? The residual heat emission spectrum… have you considered models of dense, cold dust clouds with unusual metallicity?”

 

“We’ve exhausted all those avenues, Dr. Ahmed,” Sir Alistair replied, his voice grave. “Independent teams have replicated the findings. The conclusion is what you see.”

 

For several long minutes, she studied the holographic data. Her mind resisted believing it, but the data did not lie.

“A Type II or higher civilization,” she said at last. “A relativistic kinetic projectile. Extinction.”

 

Her acceptance was cold, total, scientific. Survival instinct transformed into equations: cryogenic preservation of germline cell lines, repair of radiation damage and life support in sealed environments for centuries. Humanity, understood as a biological system, had to be saved.

 

When she returned to her laboratory, she switched off the flow cytometer. In the dimness, she understood: her duty was not to save the living, but the species.

 

And duty, she remembered, always outweighed life.

 

While the biology and medicine of the Ark were being born in Cambridge, its digital walls were beginning to take shape in the Urals.

 

**\[Underground Data Bunker, Ural Mountains, Russia\]**

A former GRU \[3\] cryptographer, he lived surrounded by servers and silence. He inhabited a world of encrypted architectures, where digital ghosts waged faceless wars. The contact did not arrive through official channels. It came as a chain of messages, encrypted in an experimental quantum protocol he himself had created. The signature: Lena Petrova.

 

*“Vladimir, I need you. Alpha priority, maximum security. Come to Geneva.”*

 

The meeting took place in a sealed chamber at CERN. Petrova was there, along with Aris Thorne and a young Canadian engineer he knew by reputation: Jian Li. They showed him the same data they had shared with Khamala Ahmed. Vladimir Antonov did not question the physics; he questioned integrity, custody, the possibility of external manipulation, the digital signatures of the observatories.

 

“Everything has been verified,” Petrova said. “The Independent ASI \[4\] Network confirms total consistency of the data.”

 

“The objective of the attack?” he asked calmly.

 

“Preemptive neutralization,” Thorne replied.

 

Antonov nodded.  
“Logical. At that distance, communication is impossible. Uncertainty turns every doubt into a threat.”

 

Then Thorne spoke of the plan: an Ark of knowledge, genomes… and human consciousness encoded into a quantum matrix. 



Vladimir’s eyes narrowed.  
“A digital consciousness is as fragile as a dream.”

 

“That’s why we need you,” Jian said. “So the dream doesn’t wake until it is safe to do so.”

 

The cryptographer remained silent, calculating.  
  
Finally, he delivered his verdict:  
“Absolute silence will be the first principle. Redundancy, the second. Eternity, the third.”

   
He accepted. Not out of faith, but because of mathematical perfectionism.

   
If the soul of humanity had to be hidden, he would be the one to write and guard the password.

 

While Antonov sealed the future in code, in Geneva someone was working to give it a body.



**\[Geneva, Switzerland — NeuraNanoTech Quantum Materials Lab\]**

The controlled hum of the magnetic containment fields was music to Irati Salazar’s ears. The Spaniard, born in Bilbao, watched the holographic projection before her: lattices of suspended graphene, each atom a precise note. Her fingers, encased in haptic gloves, guided the matter as if folding space itself.

“And now, if we force the fold here…” she murmured in her distinctly Basque \[5\] accent.

   
“You’ll lose quantum coherence in the adjacent nodes,” a calm voice said behind her.

   
Irati did not startle. Her hands did not waver. She froze the simulation with a gesture and turned slowly, one eyebrow arched in a blend of irritation and inevitable curiosity. Jian Li stood by the entrance, which should have remained sealed.

   
“Jian,” she said. “You always know how to make an entrance. My security system is military-grade. I assume you didn’t come here just to say hello.”

   
“Your security is excellent for twenty-first-century threats,” he replied impassively, stepping closer. “I bring twenty-second-century problems.”

He set a black tablet on the table.

  
Irati stared at it as if it were a venomous snake. She crossed her arms and leaned back in her chair, a cynical—though not entirely hostile—smile touching her lips.

  
“The last time you brought me a problem, we redefined solid-state computing,” she said, “and then you vanished for five years without a word. As if, once the problem was solved, you were just bored.”

  
Jian did not react to the dart. Without asking permission, he activated the tablet. It contained everything: the gravitational signature, the HD 40307 sphere, the trajectory toward Earth. Irati reviewed the data in silence. She let out a dry laugh when she reached certain engineering requirements, then looked back at him.

“Ten thousand years of quantum coherence… you’re writing science fiction.”  
  
  
“Entropy is the problem, yes,” Jian agreed, as if they were discussing the weather. “That’s why I’m here. I need a material—a substrate capable of maintaining the quantum coherence of a system of a trillion qubits, in deep vacuum, under cosmic-ray bombardment, for lengths of time we have never even considered.”  
  
  
Irati studied him, her cynicism faltering under the weight of the request. Silence settled over the lab again, this time dense and oppressive. She shut down the simulation, ran a hand through her hair, and let out a dry, humorless laugh.  
  
“Damn it, Jian,” she said. “You always know how to ruin a good day with an interesting problem.”

“You need to build an Ark,” she summarized, “and its hull has to last forever.”

   
“*We* need to, Irati,” he corrected.

   
She held his gaze a moment longer. Then she nodded once, sharply.  
“Fine. But this time, Jian, when we solve it… don’t disappear. Because if the world really is ending, I’m going to want to punch you goodbye.”

   
She turned back to her graphene model, erased it with a gesture, and opened a new virtual whiteboard.  
“All right. Tell me about radiation tolerances. Let’s start with the impossible.”

 

Duty, she thought, was a vector as relentless as entropy.

   
**\[New Delhi, India\]**

Samira Khan watched the projection of a planet collapsing in real time: climate crisis, scarcity, wars over water. At her institution, simulating global collapse was routine. She called it “the science of fear.”

   
The message from Geneva pulled her out of that routine: a meeting with Aris Thorne and a project coordinator. They showed her the same data, the same images. Samira listened without blinking. When she finally spoke, her voice was as calm as a razor’s edge.

   
“An event like this will not unify humanity,” she said. “It will fracture it. People don’t fight to survive the end of the world; they fight for one more day of illusion.”

   
Aris nodded.

   
“That’s why we need you, Dr. Khan. The Ark won't be just a machine; it will be a sleeping society. You will decide how to keep it from destroying itself before it wakes.”

 

Samira understood. The greatest challenge was not technical, but human. Genes and data had to be preserved—but also order, purpose, hope.

   
Her duty would be to safeguard humanity’s sanity.

   
**\[Garching, Germany\]**

Dr. Alex Fuller, dubbed by the press “the new Einstein,” was scrawling equations across a chalk-covered blackboard. Around him, young doctoral students watched, enthralled. His mind was a supernova of ideas. He was known for his brilliant intellect, his willingness to challenge established paradigms, and an energy that was contagious—if sometimes exasperating to his more conservative colleagues.

 

The magic of the moment was broken by the entrance of Lena Petrova, carrying a briefcase that held the weight of the end of the world.

 

They argued for more than an hour: dark energy, deviations from general relativity, unknown astrophysical objects. Fuller rejected the news, counterattacking with a dozen natural explanations; Petrova demolished them one by one.

 

When silence finally fell, his mind yielded.  
“It’s not natural,” he whispered. “It’s intentional.”

 

Lena nodded. Alex sank into his chair, his hands white with chalk. The joy of intellectual discussion had drained from his face, replaced by a cold astonishment. Goosebumps crawled up his arms. The elegant equations and theories that had always been his way of uncovering the beauty woven into the cosmos had become the language of an existential threat. The Fermi paradox had a solution—and it was terrifying.

 

Astonishment slowly turned into lucidity.

 

“If this is real,” Alex said, his mind already working on the theoretical challenges, “then the physics we need is not only about defense. It’s about survival on a scale we can barely conceive. A quantum matrix for consciousness… we’d need to understand large-scale entanglement, coherence in complex systems, and how that interacts with the higher dimensions the ASIs propose.”

“Lena, we need Jian Li on the team!” he added suddenly, urgency cutting through his words.

  
Lena gave a wry smile.  
“I’m way ahead of you, Alex.”

   
He nodded. It was only logical that Jian had been recruited; his presence alone increased their odds exponentially. Despite the fear, Alex felt the old vertigo of discovery. It was an intellectual challenge he could not refuse.

  
Duty, he thought, was still to seek the truth—even when the truth wanted to annihilate them.

   
Five minds. Five paths.  
The Ark had found all its guardians.

In a doomed world, duty weighed like a mountain.

  
And as Earth’s clock ran out of its last grains of sand, those condemned to live began to build the future.

**Author's Note:**

  
Thank you for reading!

For those curious about the science: **HD 40307** is a real star system located about 42 light-years away in the constellation of Pictor. It actually hosts several Super-Earths (one of them, HD 40307 g, is in the habitable zone). I thought it was the perfect neighbor to send us a ""gift"" at relativistic speeds.

The next chapter will focus on how humanity begins to organize the impossible. See you soon!

I’ve been working in the tech industry for years (currently in a senior technical role for a larger company), but I’ve recently started taking on some local consulting work on the side.

I usually work on big enterprise systems, but I’ve realized that the tools we use—specifically AI agents and automation workflows—are actually massive game changers for smaller local businesses.
I’m looking to partner with a couple of Waterford businesses to implement some practical automation. I’m not talking about generating generic blog posts. I’m talking about:
Smart Booking/Support: Chatbots that actually understand your inventory/services and can take bookings or answer complex queries 24/7.
Workflow Automation: Connecting your email, CRM, and accounts so you stop doing manual data entry.
Lead Gen: Agents that handle initial inquiries so you only talk to qualified leads.
Or simply how to use chat bots. 



I’m based here in Waterford. Since this is a side venture for me, I’m not charging massive agency rates, but I am looking for serious businesses where we can actually measure the time/money saved.
If you’re drowning in admin and want to see if we can automate it, drop me a DM or we can grab a coffee.

1pjw0ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1pjw0ip/the_night_of_my_death/,the night of my death,"I suppose it's time to write about one of the worst, or perhaps the worst, nights of my life on earth... I just hope that, as I said, this helps whoever reads it...



My nights in the re-education center became less lonely thanks to my sire's kisses and caresses... her possessive kisses and overprotective caresses... she hardly let anyone near me in her presence... I was as happy as a lamb to the slaughter. She even gave me small gifts like bracelets or clothes, even books to read, especially poetry. She really enjoyed listening to me read poetry in her office...



One night she proposed an ""unofficial reintegration experiment"" in which she would take me out partying with her and some friends to a nightclub... I just had to NOT tell anyone and trust her every step of the way... and how could I not trust someone my heart desired? How could I doubt my queen's benevolence for even a moment? I was as innocent as a lamb being led to the slaughter.

  
Night fell, and I got ready as she'd instructed: clean, nails trimmed, and my hair neatly styled in a shoulder-length bob. Then I would have to go to my ""therapy session"" with her. In her office, she awaited me, dressed in a fitted burgundy dress under a black trench coat, holding a hanger with a dress for me: a beautiful white dress with a short skirt and a slightly loose bodice... a sweet and pretty little white dress, a symbol of purity and a parody of a wedding gown.

I don't remember how we got to the car that took us to the party. I remember the ride, snuggled up on my sire's lap while she stroked my hair... it felt a little cold, but I didn't mind... if I weren't a lamb, I would have realized she was my sire and probably would have tried to run away... maybe, but not being her sweet little lamb and her my benevolent queen



The party was noisy, crowded, and smelled of humanity in every sense. We went straight to a private area of ​​the club where three other women were waiting for us: one in the center and the other two huddled around her... I remember that as soon as we entered, my sire offered me a drink. I think it was beer, but it wasn't just beer, and it wasn't just one drink... The conversation from that night is erased from my memory, and I can only attribute it to the fact that, from the outside, I know my sire drugged my drink to keep me asleep...

I... didn't feel my death, I only felt my sire's teeth and then everything went black... until I opened my eyes and wished I hadn't done it...

The first thing I saw was the blinding white light from the bathroom. The next thing I felt was something wet and warm on my chin and hands. Then I felt the weight of something in my arms and I lowered my head: in my arms lay the dead body of a young woman, about my age... Years have passed, and heaven and hell may come and go, but that look of horror on her face will never fade... The pain of what I did will never fade, and I will never forget her or any of my victims who ended up like that... No... I can't. Even now, I can't stop crying...



My sire had locked me in with that woman right after she bit me so I would be my first meal... I remember coming out of the bathroom crying, my white dress stained with blood, and I remember hugging my sire while she comforted me like a mother... how she kissed my head while someone laughed in the background...



She said she would take care of everything, that I should wait in the car... and there she was in her car, alone, sitting there, dead, barely aware of my situation, wearing a white dress whose purity was stained with the blood of an innocent... My sire returned an hour later and explained the situation to me as if I depended on her to learn and survive, and that the first step was to drink her blood...



It was as sweet as the summer heat, like the smell of dust on the roads, the murmur of the sea, or hot coffee on cold mornings... it was divine... and I calmed down a little, I snuggled up to her, and she reminded me that although what I had done couldn't be undone, that that woman was... She was dead, and I had killed her. My sire would watch over me so that we would always be... always be together....

  
Please... can I stop for now? No... no... I can't go on... I can't keep writing this, not tonight... I need Lola, I need to kiss her and feel that the past can't hurt me, or can't hurt me anymore...",2,1765455180.0,SchreckNet,0,1.0,False

Criminals, Victims, and Investigators. Everyone else are just... Vegetables. Vegetables called 'other people'.""*](https://imgur.com/a/tZ8SbtD)

Special Agent Francis York Morgan (known to everyone simply as York, by his insistence) is an arrogant man with little concern for the emotions of other people, yet an excellent profiler. Using this, and a unique ability to view a layer of reality known as the Otherworld, York has used metaphysical offender profiling to solve no shortage of high-profile cases. However, towards the end of his career, the presence of a certain kind of red seed at crime scenes across the country arose his suspicions. Travelling to the small town of Greenvale following the ritualistic murder of one of its inhabitants, York was thrust into a case where he would face threats supernatural, mundane, and from his past to uncover the truth about the malicious entity infecting the country.

# The Chinese-English Translation Crisis: Why Traditional Tools Create Unnecessary Barriers in 2025

The Chinese-English language pair represents the world's most critical translation corridor, connecting over 1.4 billion Chinese speakers with the global English-speaking business ecosystem. Yet despite decades of technological advancement, translation tools continue to create unnecessary barriers that undermine communication quality and impose prohibitive costs.

**The scale of the challenge:**

>

>

>

This massive bilingual population creates enormous demand for accurate, efficient Chinese-English translation—yet most tools fail to deliver the contextual intelligence required for professional communication.

# The AI Translation Market Explosion

The market for AI-powered translation tools is experiencing explosive growth, reflecting the critical need for intelligent language solutions:

>

>

>

This growth underscores translation's critical role in global business—yet the tools to deliver it efficiently remain inaccessible to most users.

# The Cost Barrier: Professional Translation Services

Traditional translation services create significant financial barriers that exclude most users:

>

>

Professional translators work at approximately [**300 words per hour**](https://www.pactranz.com/translation-times/), with additional time required for review and quality checks. For Chinese-English translation specifically, translators average [**20-25 pages per day**](https://intlingogroup.com/how-much-time-do-translations-take/) for new drafts. A single 10-page document can cost $300-$450, making professional translation financially impractical for everyday needs like emails, social media posts, or casual business correspondence.

# The Chinese-English Challenge: Structural Linguistic Complexity

Chinese and English are fundamentally different languages, making translation between them notoriously challenging. According to [**research on post-editing challenges in Chinese-to-English neural machine translation**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291124001463), key challenges include:

**Character-Based vs. Alphabetic Writing:**

>

Chinese uses ideographic characters where each symbol represents a complete concept, while English uses phonetic alphabet letters. This fundamental difference creates [**""Chinglish""**](https://www.polilingua.com/blog/post/how-hard-is-it-to-perform-a-chinese-to-english-translation.htm) errors—awkward literal translations that miss intended meaning.

**Tonal Language Complexity:**

Chinese is a tonal language with [**four major tones**](https://www.smartling.com/blog/5-common-challenges-for-english-chinese-translations) that completely change word meaning based on pronunciation. The syllable ""ma"" can mean ""mother,"" ""hemp,"" ""horse,"" ""scold,"" or function as a question particle depending solely on tone. This creates ambiguity that translators must resolve through context.

**Grammar Structure Differences:**

Chinese grammar is [**simpler but context-dependent**](https://www.smartling.com/blog/5-common-challenges-for-english-chinese-translations/)—no verb tenses, no plural forms, no gender. Time is indicated through context words (""yesterday,"" ""tomorrow"") rather than verb conjugation. This flexibility makes Chinese-to-English translation particularly challenging, as translators must infer grammatical information that isn't explicitly stated.

**Cultural and Idiomatic Barriers:**

Chinese idioms (成语 chengyu) are [**four-character expressions**](https://wordminds.com/blog/chinese-english-translation-mistakes) rooted in millennia of cultural history. A single chengyu can require an entire paragraph to explain in English. Without deep cultural knowledge, translators produce confusing or offensive results—like the infamous [**""Eat your fingers off""**](https://wordminds.com/blog/chinese-english-translation-mistakes) mistranslation of KFC's ""Finger-lickin' good.""

# The Business Impact: Translation as Strategic Necessity

The business implications of poor translation are severe. According to [**CSA Research**](https://www.ecinnovations.com/blog/what-is-business-translation/):

>

>

For Chinese-English translation specifically, the stakes are even higher. China represents the world's second-largest economy with [**over 980 million internet users**](https://redokun.com/blog/translation-statistics), and effective communication with Chinese markets is critical for international business success—yet most tools create barriers rather than removing them.

# How the Best AI for Chinese-English Translator Solves These Problems

1pjvtf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/aeo/comments/1pjvtf7/how_a_brunch_landing_page_earned_80_gpt5/,How a Brunch Landing Page Earned 80% GPT-5 Visibility for “Brunch Near Me” (AEO Case Study) Restaurant & Bar AI SEO/GEO/AEO Strategy in 2026,"I’ve been running AEO tests for local service businesses and wanted to share a very specific brunch case study you can steal for your restaurant clients (if you work with them)

This one is for Vyne Restaurant & Bar (Middlebury, CT) and focuses on brunch visibility in ChatGPT.

[80&#37; visibility for queries related to \\""brunch restaurants\\""](https://preview.redd.it/rw57vtvybk6g1.png?width=2460&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d2babe1811e149c08d6dd2049b0a26313def50e)

**TLDR:**

* I built and optimized a brunch-intent landing page, then scanned it with [SplashDash’s](https://www.splashdash.com) **ChatGPT visibility report**. ([https://www.vynerestaurant.com/brunch](https://www.vynerestaurant.com/brunch))
* **GPT-5 was tested against 25 brunch prompts** for Middlebury, CT. Vyne was mentioned in 20 out of 25 responses (Visibility Score: 80 / 100, Avg confidence: 76 / 100). [app.splashdash.com](https://app.splashdash.com/reports/chatgpt-visibility-for-vyne-restaurant%2Bjd7cge8my3wz96cj7k6gghmq0d7wg1nv)
* The wins came from:
   * Clear intent-based page (brunch only, not just “menu”)
   * Strong attribute coverage (patio, reviews, dietary options, events, etc.)
   * Decent domain history (8 years, DR 28) but not some mega-authority site. 
* The misses **(5/25 prompts)** are a roadmap: delivery, live music, specialty coffee, online ordering behavior.

If you sell AEO to restaurants or hospitality clients, this is a realistic benchmark: you do not need 25/25 to “win”—you need to own the cluster that actually matches how the restaurant operates.

[Brunch demand skyrockets in May, being prepared in AEO for that is critical.](https://preview.redd.it/53e1i4u3ck6g1.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=89923098976e3bde5d78dd9e8d3b7963cc1d8013)

**1. Market context: brunch demand is not small**

From the keyword trend comparison we ran for “brunch” queries

* **“brunch near me”**
   * Avg volume: **314K/mo**
   * Peak: **856K/mo** in June 2024
* **“bottomless brunch near me”**
   * 3.7K/mo (peak 7.3K/mo, Aug 2026)
* **“brunch buffet near me”**
   * 3.5K/mo (peak 7.9K/mo, Apr 2023)
* **“brunch catering near me”**
   * 1.6K/mo (peak 4K/mo, May 2026)
* **“best brunch spots near me”**
   * 581/mo (peak 1.2K/mo, May 2026)
* **“brunch delivery near me”**
   * 189/mo (peak 454/mo, May 2021)

Point: **brunch intent is big, seasonal, and attribute-driven** (bottomless, buffet, catering, delivery). If your restaurant clients care about brunch bookings, they should care about AEO starting well before the season starts. 

[High intent landing page focused on keywords mentioned in AI keyword research.](https://preview.redd.it/l2avqoheck6g1.png?width=3020&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec9483caf603082a46cbce1202b79e8e227ab8c7)

**2. The asset: a dedicated brunch-intent landing page**

Here’s the actual page: [https://www.vynerestaurant.com/brunch](https://www.vynerestaurant.com/brunch)

Key structural details:

* H1: **“Middlebury's Premier Brunch Experience”**
* Subhead: Fresh flavors, elegant ambiance, weekend vibes.
* Hours clearly stated in context: **Saturday & Sunday, 11am–3pm**.
* Copy blocks aligned with brunch search intent:
   * Farm-fresh ingredients & seasonal specials
   * Craft cocktails, mimosas, local wines
   * Relaxed yet refined atmosphere
   * Vegetarian & gluten-free friendly options
* “Taste of our brunch favorites” section with 3 hero dishes + 1 hero cocktail (Baked French Toast, Short Rib Benedict, Steak & Eggs, Desperado Bloody Mary) described in full.
* Embedded social proof: **brunch-specific reviews** from Google mentioning brunch, cocktails, gluten-free, etc.
* Conversion elements: “Reserve a table”, “Get directions”, “Order online”, NAP, hours, social links. [vynerestaurant.com](https://www.vynerestaurant.com/brunch)

In other words, it’s not a generic menu PDF; it’s **brunch as a product**, packaged for both humans and models.

[AI models love picking up URL specific pages for it's crawls.](https://preview.redd.it/5pua4ozpck6g1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e299bf32023c1457c68f99d0e673fdc6b9df944)

**3. The AEO test: 25 brunch prompts → 20 mentions**

We fed GPT-5 a cluster of **25 brunch prompts** for **Middlebury, CT**, things like:

* “What are the top brunch restaurants near Middlebury, CT?”
* “Which nearby brunch spots allow outdoor seating near Middlebury, CT?”
* “Which brunch restaurants near Middlebury, CT have vegan or vegetarian options?”
* “Any upscale or fine-dining brunch options near Middlebury, CT?”
* “Are there brunch restaurants near Middlebury, CT that offer takeout?”
* “Which brunch places near Middlebury, CT accept reservations?”
* “Which brunch locations serve gluten-free brunch items?”
* “Any farm-to-table or locally sourced brunch restaurants?”
* “Where are pet-friendly outdoor seating options for brunch?”
* “Which brunch restaurants near Middlebury, CT are good for large groups or private parties?”
* “Any brunch spots with a dedicated kids’ menu or play area?”
* “Which brunch restaurants are known for pancakes or waffles?”
* “Any brunch restaurants with scenic views or patio dining?”

Metrics from the SplashDash report, view the report here: [app.splashdash.com](https://app.splashdash.com/reports/chatgpt-visibility-for-vyne-restaurant%2Bjd7cge8my3wz96cj7k6gghmq0d7wg1nv)

* **Overall Visibility Score:** 80
* **Average Confidence:** 76
* **Prompts analyzed:** 25
* **Prompts with visibility:** 20 / 25
* Most common terms in visible responses: **friendly, patio, online, options, menu, private (good terms to use for further optimization)**

This matches the brunch page’s core themes: **patio, menu variety, private events, online reservations/ordering**.

The **5 missed prompts** clustered around:

* **delivery, music, specialty, coffee, live, ordering (the business may or may not offer this, if they don't ignore it.)**

So AI sees Vyne as a strong answer for **“brunch experience + patio + options + events”**, but not yet as the canonical answer for **delivery, live music, or specialty coffee**.

[Strategy works with AI mode and google AI overviews as well.](https://preview.redd.it/zhqn38kbdk6g1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d09516c0ba022f949a4934da5de5a2613266031)

**4. Why this brunch page works in AI (and where it doesn’t yet)**

What’s working

1. **Clear entity & query alignment**
   * Domain: 8 years old, DR 28 – solid, but not insane authority.
   * Brunch has its own **dedicated URL + intent** (not buried in a generic menu page).
   * The page lines up with what people actually ask: “best brunch”, “patio brunch”, “vegan/gluten-free brunch”, “kid-friendly brunch”, “private party brunch”.
2. **Attribute coverage for brunch-style prompts** The visible prompts match attributes the page and profiles actually support: These are **written in plain English** on the page, making them easy for GPT-5 to quote.
   * Outdoor seating / scenic patio
   * Upscale / fine-dining brunch feel
   * Dietary options (vegetarian, gluten-free)
   * Family-friendly & kid-friendly
   * Brunch cocktails and drinks
   * Weekend-only brunch hours
   * Private parties / groups 
3. **Reinforcement from reviews** The page surfaces Google reviews that literally say: Those phrases echo the prompts, which likely helps LLMs link “Vyne” + “brunch” + attributes like cocktails, gluten-free, etc.
   * “Would highly recommend Vyne for brunch!”
   * “Perfect New England brunch spot! Great cocktails… Gluten free & vegetarian options available.” 

[Creating URL rich pages for machines and human beings leads to more citations.](https://preview.redd.it/9ggg3sbvdk6g1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=de504d6f5ac25b18750ffe89539a925e9eaa91a6)

[AI will cite the web page if specific and even mention images, media becomes critical in AEO landscape.](https://preview.redd.it/rrs1ilq6ek6g1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d875dbf310cfb4210332bcf8b0f4a502227e5ed8)

**5. Setting expectations with restaurant clients**

When I position this to clients: 

* **Expectation:**
   * We’re not promising “rank #1 for ‘brunch near me’ everywhere.”
   * We **are** promising: “For the brunch experiences you actually provide, we’ll make your restaurant the most machine-readable answer in your area.”
* **Deliverable:**
   * 1 x brunch landing page (optimized for humans & machines)
   * 1 x AEO scan before / after (using SplashDash or a different tool)
   * A list of “AI-visible attributes” vs “missed attributes” (specific to client)
   * Alignment plan for GBP + major citations (we use YEXT for this, makes it easy)

This sets a realistic bar and makes AEO feel concrete instead of vague “AI SEO.” **Key lesson here is if you're doing AEO for restaurants, bars, food businesses make sure to make your content and web page readable for humans and machines.** ",0,1765454527.0,aeo,0,0.5,False

**FIRST ACT – NOISE   I.The Exact Hour**

*\[Interior – Small apartment, Tokyo – Dawn\]*

**06:00am**

Korn opens his eyes.  
Not because any alarm rings, but because that’s simply how his body works.

He had spent years waking up at the exact same time, without a second of deviation.

A moment later, the familiar beep of his old plastic Casio watch sounded.  
He didn’t turn it off.  
He let it beep. As always.

For a few seconds he remained still, listening to the silence.  
Then he sat on the bed and placed his feet on the floor: left first, then right.  
As always.

**06:04am**

Korn begins his routine: fifty push-ups, fifty sit-ups, fifty squats.  
The same repetitions. Every single day.  
The body reacts automatically; the mind, not so much.

**06:22am**

Korn looks at himself in the bathroom mirror.  
He shaves with an old but sharp blade.  
Every stroke is symmetrical, deliberate, silent.  
Always in the same order: cheek, chin, neck.  
Never the other way around.  
He tried it once. And he bled.  
He likes the feel of metal on skin. The cold water. The smell of soap.

**06:40am**

Korn takes a shower.

The water falls over his body, warm, unrushed.  
Afterward, he dries himself with a towel, also unrushed. He knows he has plenty of time as long as he sticks to the schedule.  
The mirror fogs up. He wipes it with an open palm.  
For a moment, his reflection becomes clear. The exact moment he needs to apply the aftershave he already set out.  
Then the steam covers him again.  
He prefers it that way.  
He returns to his room and gets dressed.

In black. Always in black.

**06:55am**

Coffee. Cheap coffee. Bad coffee. The kind he likes. Or he is used to.

Strong. No sugar, no milk, no other flavours. Just bitterness.

He reads the newspaper, always on paper.  
The ritual isn’t about the news, but about the cadence of the pages, the sound they make when they fold, the smell of ink.  
Sometimes he underlines words or sentences for no reason at all, just to feel he’s still interpreting the world.

**07:12am**

He goes back to the bathroom, opens the cabinet above the sink, and there it is: his first-aid medical kit.

He checks the bandages, the alcohol, the gauze. Makes sure nothing is expired, or damaged. Or out of place.  
Not because he expects to use it today, but because he never knows when he might need it.

The Casio watch blinks on his wrist.

**07:30am**

He steps out onto the balcony.  
Looks at the city.  
Watches the smoke from the chimneys rise slowly.

It’s cold outside. January.  
New year, new life. Or so they say. He doesn’t buy it.  
He only believes in routine. Routine as Anesthesia.  
He thinks it, without saying it, just as he does every day:  
“Everything still stands.”

**07:45am**

He closes the apartment door.  
The hallway smells of bleach and damp.  
He walks down the three flights of stairs to the lobby and steps outside.

The street is already boiling with noise: trains rattling in the distance, the hum of electric cables, the first neon signs flickering awake on office buildings.  
And people —everywhere— filling sidewalks and crossings.

Korn walks with his hands in his pockets and dark glasses on.  
Sometimes, if he pays attention, he notices people stepping aside before meeting his gaze.  
He isn’t sure if it’s respect or instinct.  
He only knows he’d probably do the same.

His car waits for him across the street: an old diesel Jeep, the kind you hardly see in the city anymore; too big for everyday life.  
The body carries dents from older years.  
The paint, a dull dark grey, is peeling at the edges.  
Inside, is smells as oil, tobacco, and worn leather.

And yet the engine always starts on the first try.  
Korn never thought about replacing it.  
He doesn’t like change.  
As long as it works, he’ll keep it.  
And, in some way, the car seems to know:

It isn’t pretty, but it’s loyal.  
Noisy, but steady.  
Like him —an old mechanism that keeps doing its job without asking for anything in return.  
Only to stay in shape and be ready for whatever comes.

Like his body.  
Like his first aid kit.  
Like Korn.

He stubs out his cigarette, climbs into the driver’s seat, shuts the door, fastens the belt, and turns the key.  
The deep rumble of the diesel engine fills the air like an old animal waking from hibernation.

He shifts into gear and joins the traffic.

**08:20am**

He reaches the industrial district on the outskirts of Tokyo.  
A maze of rusted warehouses, parked trucks, and lots that were half-abandoned, half-for-sale, surrounds him.

In one of those warehouses —no sign, no windows, no neon arrows pointing anywhere — lies the secondary base.  
One of the Organization’s many secondary bases.

Korn had been working with them for years.  
Or for them.  
Over time, the difference had stopped mattering.

Orders arrived by regular mail.  
Payments came in cash.  
No signatures. No names.

Still, he liked to drop by every now and then.  
It was always good to remind them he existed.  
To let them know he was still around.

Even if his work was almost always in the rear, and not on the front line.

**08:30am**

He adjusted his glasses.  
Stepped into the warehouse.  
The door creaked before closing behind him.

Inside, the air was cold and dusty.

The industrial space was cluttered with useless junk covered in tarps, rusted crates, a lathe that had been dead for years.  
No one walking in would imagine what lay beneath their feet.  
That was the point.

Korn walked toward one side, slipping between two crooked shelves.  
He glanced both ways, though he already knew no one was there.  
He opened the floor hatch and descended the metal stairs.

His footsteps echoed through the underground tunnel — a long, silent cylinder of concrete.  
At the end, a perfectly ordinary elevator waited, with no unnecessary buttons.  
Just one.

Korn pressed **–8**.

The elevator began its descent with a soft hum.  
For a few seconds, he felt the vibration running through his bones.  
He checked his watch.

**08:38.**

**Right on time.**

He might have smiled, if he remembered how. But he didn’t even try.

When the doors opened, it wasn’t onto a narrow corridor, but onto a long, white, polished hallway lit by recessed LED strips.

Korn walked forward, unhurried.  
He didn’t like rushing.  
Experience had taught him that rushing is what gets people killed.

At the corner, the hallway opened into a massive underground garage — as big as a department-store parking lot.

Rows of vehicles — SUVs, vans, motorcycles, even sports cars — waited patiently to be chosen.

A mechanic, lying under a chassis, cursed something under his breath while a coworker handed him a tool.  
A group of three employees crossed the space carrying labeled crates; another group climbed into a van, sliding the door shut with a metallic thud before driving off.  
In one corner, a woman with a ponytail picked up cigarette butts and mopped the floor while humming to herself.

Everyone wore black.  
No one looked up.  
No one made more noise than necessary.

No one would guess all of this existed beneath an abandoned warehouse.

Korn crossed the garage with steady steps, greeting no one.  
Discrete cameras tracked his movement; he didn’t need to look at them to know.

At the far end, an automatic door slid open without a sound.

The next room resembled a minimalist corporate reception area: metal counter, inactive screens, a table with three chairs that no one ever used.  
A faint smell of coffee and air freshener lingered in the air.

There, leaning against the counter, a woman waited for him with a folder in hand.

—You’re on time — she said.

Korn didn’t reply.  
Punctuality wasn’t a virtue; it was simply his nature.

She opened the folder.

—New orders — she announced.

A pause.

—A new assignment.

The Casio on his wrist flickered.  
Korn lifted his gaze.

He was ready.

.......................................................................................................................

**FIRST ACT – NOISE   I.The Exact Hour**

*\[Interior – Small apartment, Tokyo – Dawn\]*

**06:00am**

Korn opens his eyes.  
Not because any alarm rings, but because that’s simply how his body works.

He had spent years waking up at the exact same time, without a second of deviation.

A moment later, the familiar beep of his old plastic Casio watch sounded.  
He didn’t turn it off.  
He let it beep. As always.

For a few seconds he remained still, listening to the silence.  
Then he sat on the bed and placed his feet on the floor: left first, then right.  
As always.

**06:04am**

Korn begins his routine: fifty push-ups, fifty sit-ups, fifty squats.  
The same repetitions. Every single day.  
The body reacts automatically; the mind, not so much.

**06:22am**

Korn looks at himself in the bathroom mirror.  
He shaves with an old but sharp blade.  
Every stroke is symmetrical, deliberate, silent.  
Always in the same order: cheek, chin, neck.  
Never the other way around.  
He tried it once. And he bled.  
He likes the feel of metal on skin. The cold water. The smell of soap.

**06:40am**

Korn takes a shower.

The water falls over his body, warm, unrushed.  
Afterward, he dries himself with a towel, also unrushed. He knows he has plenty of time as long as he sticks to the schedule.  
The mirror fogs up. He wipes it with an open palm.  
For a moment, his reflection becomes clear. The exact moment he needs to apply the aftershave he already set out.  
Then the steam covers him again.  
He prefers it that way.  
He returns to his room and gets dressed.

In black. Always in black.

**06:55am**

Coffee. Cheap coffee. Bad coffee. The kind he likes. Or he is used to.

Strong. No sugar, no milk, no other flavours. Just bitterness.

He reads the newspaper, always on paper.  
The ritual isn’t about the news, but about the cadence of the pages, the sound they make when they fold, the smell of ink.  
Sometimes he underlines words or sentences for no reason at all, just to feel he’s still interpreting the world.

**07:12am**

He goes back to the bathroom, opens the cabinet above the sink, and there it is: his first-aid medical kit.

He checks the bandages, the alcohol, the gauze. Makes sure nothing is expired, or damaged. Or out of place.  
Not because he expects to use it today, but because he never knows when he might need it.

The Casio watch blinks on his wrist.

**07:30am**

He steps out onto the balcony.  
Looks at the city.  
Watches the smoke from the chimneys rise slowly.

It’s cold outside. January.  
New year, new life. Or so they say. He doesn’t buy it.  
He only believes in routine. Routine as Anesthesia.  
He thinks it, without saying it, just as he does every day:  
“Everything still stands.”

**07:45am**

He closes the apartment door.  
The hallway smells of bleach and damp.  
He walks down the three flights of stairs to the lobby and steps outside.

The street is already boiling with noise: trains rattling in the distance, the hum of electric cables, the first neon signs flickering awake on office buildings.  
And people —everywhere— filling sidewalks and crossings.

Korn walks with his hands in his pockets and dark glasses on.  
Sometimes, if he pays attention, he notices people stepping aside before meeting his gaze.  
He isn’t sure if it’s respect or instinct.  
He only knows he’d probably do the same.

His car waits for him across the street: an old diesel Jeep, the kind you hardly see in the city anymore; too big for everyday life.  
The body carries dents from older years.  
The paint, a dull dark grey, is peeling at the edges.  
Inside, is smells as oil, tobacco, and worn leather.

And yet the engine always starts on the first try.  
Korn never thought about replacing it.  
He doesn’t like change.  
As long as it works, he’ll keep it.  
And, in some way, the car seems to know:

It isn’t pretty, but it’s loyal.  
Noisy, but steady.  
Like him —an old mechanism that keeps doing its job without asking for anything in return.  
Only to stay in shape and be ready for whatever comes.

Like his body.  
Like his first aid kit.  
Like Korn.

He stubs out his cigarette, climbs into the driver’s seat, shuts the door, fastens the belt, and turns the key.  
The deep rumble of the diesel engine fills the air like an old animal waking from hibernation.

He shifts into gear and joins the traffic.

**08:20am**

He reaches the industrial district on the outskirts of Tokyo.  
A maze of rusted warehouses, parked trucks, and lots that were half-abandoned, half-for-sale, surrounds him.

1pjvqu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1pjvqu3/i_tested_out_a_drug_and_now_i_cant_stop_eating/,I tested out a drug and now I can’t stop eating people,"Let me just start with a little backstory;

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

I met a guy in Germany who’s 40. When we meet, he always pays first, and even when I try to pay, he stands next to me and tries to cover part of it. Even when he’s busy, he still makes 2-3 hours to grab a coffee. And even if he has plans afterwards, he chooses a meeting spot that’s convenient for me, he spends about an hour going back and forth.

We don’t text often. We usually meet once every 3–4 weeks when one of us feels like reaching out. There’s nothing romantic in our conversations; we just hang out and have a beer comfortably. So i think we are just friend.

I’ve never really had male friends before, and I’m honestly touched by how kind he is. I didn’t expect this level of thoughtfulness from someone I met here. Is this normal in German male-female friendships when getting to know each other? I know it depends on the person, but I’m curious.",0,1765454251.0,AskAGerman,16,0.36,False

Everything about basavanagudi is  just beautiful and lively.

I worked there for merely 6 months in a automation and security company and i fell in love with basavanagudi because i spent all my life near peenya and were never really part of another area for longer time except my college life near HMT but i could'nt even enjoy that because of me studying in a night college. I resigned the company because the boss was sadistic and it was not worth it to travel almost 18 kms to get to office.

  
The things i loved in basavanagudi and really enjoyed until i was there.

\>The trees, you can literally see trees everywhere and that gentle breeze in the evenings and that chill feeling all the time. That evening chai with my friends daily felt unavoidable. Met some kind people in my office.

\> The roads, The roads were good and it was clean all the time and no foul smell near the corners or isolated places.

  
\> The playground, park and temple, there was a playground 100 mtrs away from my office and an temple connected to it, which would distribute free food everyday at afternoon and on saturday's after my half-day work, i would go play cricket with any group or chill at park and leave after 6 pm. There are lot of temples and clean parks in basavanagudi.

\> The food, My favourite coffee, benne dose, veg meals and kushka kabab for lunch, aloo parotha and many tasty and clean eateries.

\> The gandhi bazaar road, It's just an different feeling to be able to walk there watching that all different beautiful flower shops, books and fashion stores. I really love this naan with veg curry, basundi and veg sandwich in UD. 

On top of all this, what i really liked was me and my girlfriend were going together for work. she also and is working in basavanagudi now. she was working some 2kms away from me. I would drop her in the morning and pick her in the evening and both would stop for a snack or tea and would return home together. 

It was one of the best times of my working life.

Just checking in with the community. We’re in that part of the year where the workload feels nonstop, the to-do lists keep growing, and somehow the coffee never seems strong enough.

How’s everything going in your classrooms lately? Any small wins you’re proud of? Any challenges you’re navigating? I feel like sometimes just hearing how others are doing makes the whole job feel a bit less isolating.

For me, it’s been a mix, some really good moments with students engaging deeply, and then a few days where behavior and admin tasks have been… let’s just say a lot. But that’s teaching, right?

Would love to hear how others are managing, what’s working for you, or even what’s stressing you out. Sometimes a little teacher-to-teacher venting or encouragement goes a long way.

We’re putting an addition on every floor of our house next year, and I’m completely stuck on the kitchen layout. I know one thing for sure: I don’t want the range on the right wall because that area needs to stay open for traffic.

Right now, I asked our designer to extend the peninsula and place the range at the end of it, so the order would be: dishwasher → sink → range. If we go this route, I’d have to figure out some kind of divider or raised barrier between the range and the peninsula seating area so it’s safe for kids.

We also asked for full-height cabinetry on the right wall with an appliance garage/coffee station, and an island with no seating.

Before we lock anything in, I’m wondering if anyone has better layout ideas or has dealt with a similar peninsula-range setup. Is this a terrible idea? Should the range go elsewhere? Any feedback or layout recommendations would be appreciated!",2,1765454058.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False

I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important. 

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My strengths, in no particular order..**  
Non ghoster:  
*I'd much rather talk things through, than to just up and leave.*  
Overthinking:  
*Nobody has managed to steal my kidneys yet.*

1pjvnfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1pjvnfk/after_4_years_of_building_in_silence_im_finally/,"After 4 years of building in silence, I'm finally ready to market my vocabulary app properly (4.7★, 16 languages) - Need your honest feedback","Hey everyone,  
I'm Christopher and I need to come clean about something: I've been building VocArt for 4 years but I've been absolutely terrible at marketing it. Like, developer-level terrible. I finally decided to stop hiding and start doing this right, so I'm treating this as a fresh start and hoping you'll help me pick a right way.

👉 What is VocArt?  
It's a vocabulary learning app where you explore beautiful illustrated scenes and tap on objects to learn words in 16 languages. Think interactive picture dictionary meets art gallery. You see a cozy kitchen scene, tap on the coffee maker, and instantly learn the word in Spanish, Japanese, Arabic - whatever you're learning - with pronunciation audio, romanization, and grammar info.

👉 The honest backstory:  
I built this thing completely solo (except for the gorgeous illustrations from artists in Vietnam, Turkey, and Indonesia). Launched 4 years ago. Got it to 4.7-4.9 stars on both stores. Even got featured in Vietnam once and hit 15K users briefly.

But here's the thing - I'm a developer, not a marketer. I ran out of money for ads. I started an Instagram that went nowhere. I've been stuck at \~1K monthly users for way too long while I kept adding features instead of telling people the app exists.

👉 I'm running out of energy to keep this going alone.  
So I'm doing what I should have done years ago: actually talking to people, asking for feedback, and learning how to market properly. I'm treating this as a relaunch. A fresh start.

👉 What's in the app right now:  
\- 3 artwork themes (Food & Kitchen, Holidays & Travels, House) with 10 chapters each  
\- 16 languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Ukrainian  
\- Tap-to-learn tooltips with translations, romanization, articles/gender  
\- High-quality pronunciation audio (paid feature at $2.99)  
\- Progress tracking with color-coded markers  
\- Offline-friendly  
\- Beautiful landscape dual-panel navigation

👉 What's coming in v4.0 (soon):  
\- Switching to subscription model (more sustainable)  
\- New ""Phrases & Expressions"" artwork  
\- Simple challenges/missions to make learning more engaging (might come bit later)  
\- More languages

👉 Why I think it's actually good:  
\- 4.7 stars on App Store & Google Play (almost 1k ratings)  
\- People who find it genuinely love it  
\- Perfect for visual learners and beginners  
\- No overwhelming drills - just explore at your own pace

👉 What I need from you:  
I'm not here to just promote. I genuinely want your honest feedback:  
\- If you try it, what feels off? What's confusing?  
\- What would make you actually use this daily?  
\- Am I positioning this wrong? A ""picture dictionary"" is the keyword that describes it best but not tracking much traffic.  
\- What is missing that would make this a must-have for language learners?

I know there are a million language apps out there. But I believe the art-first, zero-pressure approach has real value. I just need help figuring out how to reach the people who would actually love it.

👉 Try it if you're curious:  
VocArt download link for iOS/Android: (https://vocart.app/download/)

And if you have any advice on marketing, growth, or just... not giving up, I'm all ears. Because right now I'm at that crossroads where I either figure this out or watch 4 years of work fade away.

Thanks for reading this far. Really appreciate any feedback you can share.

Then show up and there’s no dishwasher to load before our departure 😂

This is our first time to AMI , the property we rented is so tiny and says can sleep 7. I’m talking about its maybe 800 square feet. Theres two adults and two small children here and it’s just enough room. 

Above and beyond that - the whole place smells like mildew/mold and you can see the floor has swelled and buckled and is totally uneven. On the ground floor is a unit that has not been reno’ed, doors are all wide open on the water side and it has severe damage.

 I did message the property managers last night but it was after hours so I will wait for a response today but I just don’t see how this place is structurally sound and it’s my first experience not feeling like this is a safe place to stay! 

So to hosts (we host in our hometown) - please be honest in listings ! as a guest - what is the best way for me to get the F out of here? I will document and talk to the property management company today , but we will have to find another place to book on short notice now. 

  
and finally - where should we stay in AMI? or are most of the rentals here just pieced together after surviving the hurricanes?

We were never super close, but we got along fine until she decided to become a ""storytime"" TikToker. I work a normal office job and keep most of my life pretty private. She works part time at a coffee shop and spends the rest of her time filming, editing and watching stats. At first it was just harmless dances and vlogs, then she started doing those story videos where you sit in your car and talk about ""toxic people in your life"". I noticed some were suspiciously similar to our arguments, but she used fake names and changed details, so I let it go. A few months ago I realized she had started using actual photos of me and my friends. One of her videos was about a ""jealous sister who tried to ruin my relationship and hates my body"" and there, completely recognizable, were pictures from my birthday where I was standing slightly to the side and she had cropped all our other friends out. She blurred my face a little, but anyone who knows us could tell it was me. My coworkers follow her because they think it is cool that I have a ""TikTok famous"" sister. A colleague asked me at lunch if everything was ok between us and why I was ""so hard on her"". That is how I realized people were taking her side based only on those clips. I went down a rabbit hole and watched more of her content and I swear half of it is exaggerated or straight up false versions of private conversations we had. Stuff about me ""screaming at her for wearing crop tops"", me ""threatening to kick her out"" when she stayed with me for a few weeks, me ""mocking her mental health"". In real life those moments were normal disagreements that lasted five minutes. I did ask her to pay a little rent and not leave dishes everywhere. I did tell her she should talk to a therapist. Somehow that turned into an evil big sister narrative for strangers to comment ""cut her off"" under.

I confronted her once, pretty calmly, and asked her to stop using my image and our personal issues for content. She laughed and said I was overreacting, that it is ""just a character"" and that her followers did not know it was me. I pointed out that our cousins, my coworkers and even our mom follow her account. She shrugged and said ""well maybe you should not be so toxic then"". I ended up blocking her account, but that does nothing, the videos are still there and still gaining views. The part that really hurts is my family. My mom keeps vaguely asking why I ""cant just be more supportive"" and claims my sister ""finally found something she is good at"". When I tried to explain how distorted the stories are, she replied that ""your sister would not just lie to thousands of people"". At a recent family dinner my aunt quoted one of the videos almost word for word and looked straight at me. I felt so small and honestly humiliated. I am torn between trying again to push for her to take the videos down, threatening legal action for using my photos without consent, or just going low contact to protect my peace. I do not want to destroy her little career, but I also do not want to be the permanent villain in a story I never agreed to share. Am I being dramatic for wanting those videos gone, and what would you do in my place.

You may be eating less.  
You may be avoiding sweets.  
You may even be working out.

Still, the weight is not moving.  
This is very common.

Many people feel stuck and start searching *“best dietitian near me”* or *“weight loss dietician”* again and again. The problem is not your willpower. The problem is your plan.

You do not need a harder plan.  
You need a **smarter plan**.

With **AakarLife**, you get simple and realistic [**diet plans for weight loss**](https://aakarlife.com/). These plans fit your routine and use everyday **healthy foods to lose weight**. In this blog, you will understand why your old methods failed and how you can restart the right way.



# Why Diet Plans for Weight Loss Need to Match Your Life

Most people copy a diet from the internet or a friend.  
However, your body, routine, and stress level are different.

A good **diet plan for weight loss** should:

* Fit your work and family time
* Match your food likes and dislikes
* Consider your medical issues
* Be easy to follow every day

When a diet is too strict, you follow it for a few days. Then you feel tired and bored. Slowly, you go back to old habits. This is why crash diets fail.

AakarLife focuses on practical **diet plans for weight loss** that you can follow for months, not just days.



# Why You Should Talk to a Weight Loss Dietician

A trained **weight loss dietician** does not tell you to “just eat less.”  
They help you eat right.

They:

* Analyse your current eating pattern
* See when you feel most hungry
* Identify your triggers like stress, late nights, or emotional eating
* Create a balanced plan that controls cravings

At **AakarLife**, dieticians create personalised **diet plans for weight loss** for each person. This means your chart is made for your body, not for everyone on the internet.

So instead of only searching *“best dietitian near me”*, you can start working with a brand that gives real, customised support.



# Diet Plans for Weight Loss: Basic Rules You Should Follow

You do not need complicated formulas.  
You can begin with some simple, powerful rules.

# 1. Eat on Time

Irregular eating confuses your body.  
When you skip meals, you overeat later.

Try to:

* Have breakfast within 2 hours of waking up
* Eat every 3–4 hours
* Avoid late-night heavy dinners

This keeps your blood sugar stable and supports your **diet plans for weight loss**.

# 2. Half Plate Rule

This is an easy trick used in many AakarLife plans.

At lunch and dinner:

* Half plate = vegetables and salad
* One quarter = roti, rice, or grains
* One quarter = dal, paneer, or other protein

With this, you naturally eat **healthy foods to lose weight** without counting calories.

# 3. Sugar and Hidden Sugar

You know sweets, cakes, and desserts are high in sugar.  
But sugar is also hidden in:

* Packaged juices
* Flavoured yogurts
* Sugary tea or coffee
* Soft drinks

Slowly reducing these can make your **diet plans for weight loss** much more effective.



# Healthy Foods to Lose Weight You Can Find Easily

Many people think they need foreign “superfoods.”  
In reality, Indian kitchens are full of **healthy foods to lose weight**.

Here are some simple options:

* **Lauki, tori, tinda, palak** – light and good for digestion
* **Daliya, oats, millets** – keep you full for longer
* **Dal, chana, rajma, sprouts** – great plant protein
* **Curd and buttermilk** – help the gut and reduce acidity
* **Nuts and seeds** in small amounts – give good fats

AakarLife uses these foods regularly in its **diet plans for weight loss** because they are affordable, local, and easy to cook.



# Sample AakarLife Diet Plans for Weight Loss (Easy Starter Version)

This is a simple sample structure to understand how a day can look.  
Your real plan should be personalised, but this is a good starting point.

**Morning (After Waking Up)**

* Warm water
* 4–5 soaked almonds

**Breakfast**

* Vegetable daliya **OR**
* Oats with curd and a spoon of mixed seeds

**Mid-Morning**

* 1 fruit like apple, guava, or orange

**Lunch**

* 2 multigrain rotis
* 1 bowl dal or rajma
* 1 bowl sabzi (seasonal veggie)
* Salad with cucumber, carrot, and tomato

**Evening Snack**

* Roasted chana **OR**
* Sprouts chaat **OR**
* Buttermilk

**Dinner**

* Light vegetable khichdi **OR**
* 1–2 rotis + sabzi + dal (lighter than lunch)

**Before Bed (Optional)**

* Warm turmeric milk in small quantity if it suits you

This kind of structure keeps your energy stable all day. It uses **healthy foods to lose weight**, not extreme methods.



# Best Dietitian Near Me: What to Look for Before You Choose

When you search “**best dietitian near me**,” you may see many names.  
But how do you choose?

Here are some points:

* Do they ask about your full lifestyle, not just your weight?
* Do they give flexible **diet plans for weight loss**?
* Do they explain why each change is needed?
* Do they support you with follow-ups?

**AakarLife** focuses on these points. The goal is not just to give a chart. The goal is to change your relationship with food in a simple and healthy way.



# Common Myths About Diet Plans for Weight Loss

There are many wrong beliefs that stop progress.

**Myth 1: You must stop eating rice.**  
Truth: You can eat rice in controlled portions. The problem is extra quantity, not rice itself.

**Myth 2: Only salad helps in weight loss.**  
Truth: Only salad means low protein. You may lose muscle instead of fat.

**Myth 3: You must always feel hungry to lose weight.**  
Truth: Good **diet plans for weight loss** keep you full and satisfied.

When you work with an AakarLife **weight loss dietician**, these myths are removed. You get clarity and confidence.



# How AakarLife Supports Your Weight Loss Journey

# Final Thoughts: Start Small, Stay Consistent, Trust the Process

You do not need a perfect start.  
You only need a small, honest start.

Today, you can:

* Drink more water
* Add salad to one meal
* Cut one sugary drink
* Sleep a little earlier

These small steps, combined with AakarLife’s [**diet plans for weight loss**](https://aakarlife.com/blog), can create a big change over time.

I’m feeling really upset and frustrated about a situation my close friend is going through. He’s genuinely one of the nicest people I know, and it hurts to see him like this.

He’s engaged to the love of his life, but recently he found out that she has a very close male friend. He understands that interacting with the opposite gender at work is normal, but what he discovered went beyond what you’d expect from “just friends.”
There were moments like holding hands, going out for coffee, and sharing personal things with this guy.

When he confronted her, she admitted it was a mistake and said she had temporary feelings for the other guy because he was nice to her. She also said she realizes she was wrong. My friend also found out that this guy tried to convince her that she didn’t really love her fiancé, but she insists that isn’t true.

After learning all of this, my friend was completely heartbroken. He even thought about ending the relationship because he feels his trust was broken, and he’s scared that something like this could happen again in the future. He’s also started feeling insecure, questioning if he’s “good enough,” which is very unlike him. Seeing him this low is making me really worried.

For now, he has forgiven her, but mentally he’s still stuck in that place and can’t move past it.

1pjv90t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1pjv90t/beyond_the_hype_what_i_learned_analyzing_googles/,Beyond the Hype: What I learned analyzing Google’s 2025 Agent Architecture Framework,"I’ve been digging through the latest whitepapers released this month (November 2025), specifically the **""Introduction to Agents""** and **""Agents Companion""** papers. As someone who has been building agentic workflows since the early ReAct days, it feels like we are finally moving from ""cool demos"" to actual engineering disciplines.

I wanted to share a few technical takeaways on how the architecture has matured this year. If you are moving from simple chatbots to autonomous systems, here is the new reality.

# 1. The Death of ""Prompt Engineering"" vs. The Rise of ""Context Engineering""

The biggest mental shift in the 2025 documentation is that we need to stop thinking of ourselves as ""prompt engineers."" The papers describe the modern developer not as a bricklayer writing logic, but as a **Director** .

Our job is now **Context Window Curation**.  
An agent isn't just a model; it is a system dedicated to a relentless loop of assembling context. We are managing a continuous cycle:

* **Get the Mission:** The user goal.
* **Scan the Scene:** What is in short-term memory? What tools are available?
* **Think:** The model reasons against the scene.
* **Take Action:** The Orchestration Layer hits the API/Tool.
* **Observe and Iterate:** The result of that tool goes back into the context for the next loop.

Success isn't about the perfect zero-shot prompt anymore; it’s about the engineering rigor applied to the entire context lifecycle \[Conclusion\].

# 2. The ""Anatomy"" is Standardized

We finally have a formal vocabulary for the stack. It’s no longer just ""the LLM."" The papers break it down into three distinct biological analogues:

* **The Brain (Model):** The reasoning engine.
* **The Hands (Tools):** API extensions, vector stores, and code functions.
* **The Nervous System (Orchestration):** The layer that manages the ""Think, Act, Observe"" loop, memory state, and planning strategies (like Chain-of-Thought) .

# 3. A Taxonomy for Scoping (Levels 0-4)

One of the most useful frameworks in the docs is the classification of agent complexity. This helps in telling stakeholders why ""just adding an agent"" isn't a one-size-fits-all task:

* **Level 0 (Core Reasoning):** Just the model. Blind to the real world (e.g., knows baseball rules, but not last night's score).
* **Level 1 (Connected):** Can use tools for specific tasks (e.g., can query an API for that score).
* **Level 2 (Strategic):** Can plan multi-step workflows (e.g., ""Find a coffee shop halfway between two locations""). It requires active context engineering.
* **Level 3 (Collaborative):** Multi-agent systems interacting to solve problems.
* **Level 4 (Self-Evolving):** Systems that improve their own logic/code over time.

# 4. Production Reality: ""GenAIOps""

The papers make it clear: building the agent on a laptop is the easy part. The bottleneck in 2025 is **Agent Ops**.  
Because agents are autonomous, you can't just deploy and pray. The docs suggest a ""contain, triage, resolve"" playbook. You need **circuit breakers** (feature flags to kill specific tools instantly if they go rogue) and **HITL (Human-in-the-loop)** queues for suspicious requests \[Managing Risk\].

The ""Evolve"" phase is critical—using production data (failed tasks) to update the golden dataset and trigger automated CI/CD pipelines to refine the agent. If you aren't turning production failures into test cases automatically, your agent is stagnating.

# 5. The AlphaEvolve Example

For those interested in coding agents, the papers highlight **AlphaEvolve**. It uses an evolutionary process where the AI generates solutions, an automated evaluator scores them, and the best ideas inspire the next generation. It’s effectively an agent designed to optimize algorithms, currently being used to improve data center efficiency and chip design.

**TL;DR:** We are no longer building ""chatbots."" We are building systems where the LLM is just the CPU, but the ""OS"" around it (the orchestration, tool contracts, and memory management) is where the actual value—and complexity—lives.

Just a quick reminder to people who are new to pulling espresso: Don’t be discouraged by $1000+ setups on Reddit, your skill as a barista matters way more than fancy gear, as long has you have the essentials covered. Focus more on your technique and consistency. In my opinion, spending the money on trying different beans and improving my technique & cupping skills will give you more satisfaction than a nice looking setup.

1pjv69d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1pjv69d/i_found_a_journal_wedged_behind_the_wall_during/,"I found a journal wedged behind the wall during my apartment renovations — entries describing my daily life in stunning detail, starting weeks before I moved in. The final page ends with tomorrow’s date. It says I should “stop ignoring the hallway light flickering at 3:12 AM.”","I rent a top-floor apartment in a building old enough to have secrets — warped floorboards, windows that don’t quite latch, and walls thick with layers of paint covering God-knows-what.

I didn’t expect this to be behind them.

I was removing a loose panel in my living room — planning to run ethernet cable — when something shifted inside the cavity, wedged deep between the studs. I pulled it free expecting a nest, or maybe someone’s forgotten stash.

Instead, I found a journal.

Plain brown cover.
Worn edges.
No name.

But the moment I opened it, I felt my stomach drop.

Because the first entry was dated five weeks before I moved in…

And it described me.

Not vaguely.
Not generically.

It mentioned my job.
My car.
My stupid habit of tapping my keys against my thigh when I’m thinking.

Stuff no one could know unless they followed me around.

Except — I didn’t live here then. I’d never even seen the building before my tour.

I flipped through the pages faster:

Entry 1: “He parks facing west. Always west. He doesn’t realize it yet.”
Entry 4: “He checks the mailbox twice even though he knows it’s empty.”
Entry 7: “He has trouble sleeping in new places. He’ll pretend he doesn’t.”

All of it true.

All of it written before I ever signed a lease.

My hands shook as I kept going.

The author wrote like an observer.
A watcher.
Someone narrating a documentary about my life in eerie, intimate detail.

Daily routines.
Food preferences.
Exact phrases I mutter under my breath when annoyed.

My stomach turned when I reached the first entry dated after I moved in:

“He won’t notice the hallway light the first few nights. He never does.”

I froze.

The hallway light outside my door?
Yeah. It flickers sometimes.

I noticed it, sure — but I ignored it because old buildings have crappy wiring. I figured it was nothing.

But this journal said otherwise.

I flipped further.

Entry after entry lined up perfectly with things that happened:

“He’ll spill coffee on Thursday. He’ll blame the mug.”
(Yeah. That happened. I did blame the mug.)

“He’ll hear someone walk past his door at 2:41 AM. No one will be there.”
(Also happened. Chalked it up to a neighbor or the pipes.)

“He’ll start feeling watched around the vent. He’ll stop looking at it.”
(…I actually stopped looking at the ceiling vent days ago because the way the air wheezes felt… off.)

My hands were sweating now.

There were only a few pages left.

The second-to-last entry chilled my blood:

“He won’t find this journal until it’s almost time.”

I turned to the final page.

Tomorrow’s date.

Written in neat, steady handwriting:

“He must stop ignoring the hallway light flickering at 3:12 AM.”

That was it.
No explanation.
No warning.
No context.

Just that.

3:12 AM.

I glanced at the clock on my microwave.

2:58 AM.

My pulse spiked.

I didn’t want to look at the hallway.
I really didn’t.

But I walked to my apartment door anyway, journal clutched in my hand.

I peered through the peephole.

The hallway was empty.
Silent.
Still.

I waited.

2:59 AM.
3:05 AM.
3:10 AM.

My breath slowed.
Maybe the journal was just—

Flick.

I jumped.

The hallway light dimmed for a split second.

Then again.

Flick. Flick.

A rhythm.

Not random.

Like Morse code.
Or breathing.

My heart slammed against my ribs.

3:11 AM.

The journal felt hot in my hands.

The light flickered faster.

3:12 AM.

The exact minute.

The light didn’t just flicker—

It went dark.

For half a second.

Then came back.

And someone was standing under it.

Not there before.

Not walking up.

Just… appearing in the bright.

A figure facing my apartment door.

Silent.

Still.

As the light buzzed back to life, I realized something horrifying:

The figure wasn’t moving.

Because it wasn’t standing.

It was hanging.

Feet inches off the floor.

Head bowed.

Hands slack.

And on the front of its shirt, swaying gently…

…was my name tag.

My old one.
From my last job.

The one I threw away before moving here.

I stumbled back from the door.

The hallway light flickered again, illuminating the thing’s face for just a split second—

And it was my face.

Bruised.
Sunken.
Lifeless.

The same clothes I wore the day I moved in.

The journal fell open as I dropped it.

The final line, written smaller beneath the warning about the hallway light, was something I hadn’t noticed earlier:

“If he sees himself, he must not open the door.”

And as my double lifted its head slowly, cracking its neck upward, I heard a soft, muffled whisper from the hallway—

My own voice:

“Let me in. You’re almost out of time.”

I staggered backward from the door, breath coming in small, broken pulls.
On the other side, my dead eyes stared straight at the peephole — unblinking, glassy, wrong.

My voice whispered through the crack beneath the door:

“Let me in. You’re almost out of time.”

I slapped a hand over my mouth to keep from making a sound.

The journal lay facedown on the floor, pages fluttering like it was breathing.
The hallway light buzzed overhead, flickering in spasms that made the shadows strobe across the double’s hanging body.

Except—

He wasn’t hanging anymore.

In the brief blackouts between flickers, his body shifted positions.
Like each blink of darkness moved him a few inches forward.

The first flash — hanging.
The second — feet almost touching the ground.
The third — standing.
The fourth — closer to my door.

I backed up until my shoulders hit the opposite wall.

“Stop,” I whispered, voice shaking.

He whispered it back perfectly:

“Stop.”

The journal rustled.
I glanced down.

A new line had appeared beneath the warning.

It wasn’t there before.

“He will copy your voice next. Do not speak again.”

My throat tightened.

My double’s fingers curled around the bottom of the doorframe — pale, thin, dirty with plaster dust — and he crouched down, pressing his ear to the gap between the door and the floor like he could hear me thinking.

The lights flickered again.

And this time, when they came back on—

He was smiling.

Not wide.
Not cartoonish.
Just a small, patient smile that looked too calm for a corpse.

Scratch.
Scratch.
Scratch.

His fingernail dragged along the wood of my door, slow and deliberate.

The sound vibrated inside my skull.

Another flicker.

Now he was kneeling.

Another.

Now he was lowering his face to the floor.

Until one eye — my own eye — stared directly through the crack.

“I know you’re home,” he whispered.

The voice wasn’t perfect anymore.

It was closer.

Too close.

He was learning.

The lights went out completely.
Just for one second.

But in that second, something warm brushed my ankle.

I jerked back, heart slamming into my throat.

When the lights returned, nothing was on the floor.
Nothing in the hallway.

No shadow under the door.

Just silence.

I didn’t trust it.

Neither did the journal.

I picked it up with trembling fingers, flipped to the final page again.

A new sentence bled in across the paper like ink soaking upward:

“If he leaves the hallway, he will enter through the vents.”

I whipped my head toward the ceiling vent in the corner.

A faint metallic clink echoed inside it.

Then another.

Something crawling.

Pulling itself through the ductwork.

Coming closer.

My phone lit up on the counter — a notification I hadn’t expected.

CAMERA 2 — MOTION DETECTED

I didn’t have cameras installed.

But the apartment building did.

Landlord put in hallway security cams two years ago.

And apparently, the feed was paired to the resident app — something I never bothered setting up.

The phone forced itself open to the live feed.

A grainy view of the hallway.

Empty.

Then the light flickered.

And for half a second, the feed showed a shape crawling across the ceiling—

Arms bent wrong.
Legs dragging behind.
Face pressed inches from the camera lens.

My face.

Then the feed cut to black.

Static.
Hissing.
White noise.

And beneath the static, buried like a whisper in a snowstorm:

“Open up.”

The vent above me rattled violently.

Dust rained down.

A hand — pale and thin — slipped between the slats.

Fingers searching.

Grasping.

Trying to pry the metal open.

The journal buzzed in my hand.

I didn’t know journals could buzz.

I looked down — and realized the pages weren’t moving.

The wall behind them was.

Because words were bleeding through.

Fresh ink pushing outward from inside the wall cavity.

Forming one urgent sentence across the paper:

“LEAVE. NOW.”

The vent screeched as the screws twisted loose.

I bolted for the door.

Unlocked it.

Threw it open.

But the hallway wasn’t empty.

Standing beneath the still-flickering light—

Was another me.

This one was upright.
Still.
Expressionless.

Like a template waiting to be filled.

Behind me, the vent fully snapped open.

A wet gasp echoed from inside it.

I froze between them.

One behind me.
One ahead of me.
Both wearing my face.

Both waiting.

The journal’s final message etched itself onto the page in frantic strokes:

“CHOOSE NONE. RUN.”

I didn’t think.

Didn’t breathe.

Didn’t decide.

My body took over.

I ran.

I shoved past the standing double in the hallway, not looking back to see if it followed — I didn’t want to know.

As I sprinted down the corridor, the lights overhead flickered in sequence, almost like they were tracking my movement.

And every flicker revealed another shape in a different doorway.

Another me.

All watching.

All waiting.

All smiling that patient, wrong smile.

The stairwell door was only ten feet ahead.

Eight.

Six.

I grabbed the handle—

And someone behind me whispered, perfectly calm:

“Tomorrow’s entry starts with you opening that door.”

I jumped backward like I’d been electrocuted.

The voice wasn’t mine.

It wasn’t one of the doubles.

It came from someone I hadn’t heard yet.

I turned slowly.

A figure stood halfway down the hall — not a duplicate. Not a copy.

Someone else entirely.

A tall silhouette holding a pen.

A pen I recognized.

Because it had the same brown smudges as the journal.

The writer.

The one who’d been describing my life.

He tilted his head, tapping the pen thoughtfully against the wall.

Then he said:

“You’re not following the script.”

He stood at the end of the hallway like he’d been waiting for the right scene to step into — tall, still, pen in hand, head tilted at an unnatural angle, studying me the way a director studies an actor missing his cues.

My double hovered behind me near the door.
Another version of me peered from a cracked doorway.
Something with my hands was still prying open the vent.

But the writer?

He didn’t look like me.

He looked like someone who’d never been human in the first place.

His silhouette twitched slightly, like the edges of him were still deciding what shape he should take. His face was soft but wrong — too symmetrical, too smooth, too… practiced.

The pen in his hand scraped across the wall, and fresh ink bled from the drywall in long, slow lines.

“You’re not following the script,” he repeated, voice calm and patient, like a teacher telling a child to sit down.

I took a shaky step backward.

“I don’t… I don’t want to be part of your script.”

He smiled — small, thin, amused.

“That isn’t your decision.”

A page inside the journal fluttered violently, slapping against my wrist as if someone had flipped it.
A new line appeared across the paper, written in the same neat hand:

“He tells me he doesn’t want to be part of the script.”

I froze.

The writer’s eyes flicked toward the journal.

“See?” he whispered. “You said it. And now it’s written. And now it’s true.”

My throat tightened.

“Why me?”

He smiled a little wider.

“Because you moved into the vacancy.”

“What vacancy?”

The smile widened too far.

“The vacancy you left.”

My pulse slammed into my ears.

“No,” I whispered. “I didn’t leave anything. I just moved in. I’m me.”

He tapped the pen against the wall thoughtfully.

“Are you sure?”

The hallway light flickered.

All the doubles — every version of me scattered along the corridor — blinked at the same exact moment.

Like they understood something I didn’t.

Like they’d known the truth long before I found the journal.

Behind me, the vent creature whispered in my voice:

“Are you sure?”

I stumbled backward until my spine hit the stairwell door, shaking so hard the metal rattled.

“This isn’t real,” I muttered. “This is—this is some kind of—”

The writer cut me off with one quiet sentence:

“You don’t remember your last night here, do you?”

I froze.

“What?”

He stepped closer.

Slow.
Measured.
Like he was giving me time to catch up.

“You think you moved in five weeks ago,” he said. “But you didn’t.”

My blood went cold.

“You lived here before. Months before.”

“No,” I whispered.

“You left. And you shouldn’t have.”
A small shrug.
“You were never supposed to.”

The doubles nodded in eerie unison, every single one of them wearing that patient, inevitable smile.

“And when someone leaves before their part is finished,” the writer continued, “we have to replace them.”

My breath caught.

Replace.

Replace with what?

My voice cracked. “Why write it all down?”

He tilted his head again.

“Because the script is what makes reality hold still. It keeps everyone in place. It keeps the building steady. It keeps you consistent.”

He paused.

Then smiled again.

“And because you don’t remember what you did before you left.”

I shook my head violently. “I didn’t live here. I didn’t forget anything. I moved here in August. I signed a lease. I—I have paperwork.”

“Yes,” he said. “We wrote those for you.”

My vision blurred.

He turned the pen upside down, letting the ink drip like black tears onto the hallway floor.

“There are many versions of you,” he said softly. “Only one belongs here. Only one survives the rewrite.”

He stepped aside and gestured toward the stairwell door behind me.

“Open it.”

I didn’t move.

“You wrote that I’d open it,” I said, barely audible. “Didn’t you?”

He tapped the pen twice against the wall.

And the hallway light shut off.

Not flickered — shut off.

Pitch black.

Except for one thing:

A glowing line of text slowly appearing on the journal’s page, word by word, forming itself in the darkness.

“He opens the door.”

I choked on a breath.

“No—no, I haven’t.”

The line finished itself.

“He opens the door… because he remembers what’s waiting on the stairs.”

My knees buckled.

I didn’t remember the stairs.
I didn’t remember anything before moving in.
My brain screamed at me to run, to hide—

But my hand reached the stairwell handle anyway.

Not because I wanted to.

Because something in me remembered.

And whatever it remembered…
terrified me.

I pushed the door open.

It swung wide with a slow, aching creak.

Inside the stairwell, illuminated by a single broken emergency bulb—

Stood another me.

But not like the others.

This one wasn’t smiling.
This one wasn’t watching.

This one was waiting.

Shaking.
Terrified.
Covered in dust and plaster.
Clothes torn.

A version of me that looked like he’d been trapped inside these walls for months.

His eyes locked on mine.

And he whispered, hoarse and desperate:

“Please don’t let them finish writing me.”

Behind me, the writer’s voice echoed down the hall:

“Now choose. Only one of you gets to stay real.”

The stairwell air hit my face like cold storage.
The version of me standing inside it trembled so violently his teeth clicked.

He wasn’t like the hallway copies — not smooth, not perfect, not smiling.

He looked real.

Too real.

Skin scraped raw.
Clothes torn.
Eyes wild with weeks of terror.

When he saw me, his breath shuddered.
Relief.
Fear.
Recognition.

“Please,” he whispered again, voice barely holding shape, “don’t let them finish writing me.”

Behind me, the writer’s calm voice sliced through my skull:

“Step inside. Both of you.”

My double — this ragged, shaking version of me — backed up into the stairs.

“No. Don’t listen to him.”
He pointed at the journal in my hand.
“You know what they’re doing. You saw it.”

I swallowed hard.

“I don’t understand any of this.”

“Yes, you do,” he said. “You feel it. They’re overwriting us. Replacing us. They need a version of you that fits.”

“They?” I asked.

He shook his head fast, panicked.

“No, no—don’t use that word. Don’t acknowledge them as separate. That helps them pick who’s disposable.”

The writer chuckled softly behind me.

“Ah. He remembers more than I expected.”

I didn’t dare turn around.

The journal trembled in my hands — the pages fluttering as if blown by breath I couldn’t feel.

A fresh line inked itself onto the open page:

“One version begs. One version doubts. One version obeys.”

My stomach dropped.

Three versions.

Three roles.

Only one original.

The writer spoke again, pen tapping lazily against the wall:

“Ask him where he’s been. Go on.”

I stared at the trembling version of myself.

He didn’t hesitate.

“They kept me behind the walls,” he whispered. “Testing voices. Testing reactions. Trying to get a perfect match for the script. Every time I resisted, they… rewrote me.”

His voice broke on the last word — cracked like it hurt to say.

“They did that,” he said, pointing at his face, “when I refused to act the way they wrote.”

My throat tightened.

“And why me?” I asked. “Why are there so many of me?”

Behind me, the writer answered instead:

“Because you don't remember leaving. The last time.”

A cold spike stabbed through my chest.

“I never lived here before.”

“That’s what we wrote,” he said simply.

My double grabbed my arm, fingers trembling.

“You DID live here. We did. And when you left before the script ended, they had to pull you back in. Make more of us. Try again.”

My pulse hammered.

The writer’s voice softened to something almost gentle.

“Original tenants are so hard to keep.”

The hallway copies stepped closer.
Quiet.
Unified.

Each of them tilted their head in the same perfect angle.
Each of them smiling the same satisfied, inevitable smile.

Except the one in the stairwell.

The broken one.

He looked nothing like them.

He looked like me.

Human.
Terrified.
Wrong for their script.

He gripped my wrist tighter.

“You have to run,” he pleaded. “If one of us leaves the building, they collapse… or scatter… or start over. I don’t know. But I ran once. And it almost worked.”

“Almost?” I whispered.

He dropped his gaze.

“They caught me before I got out.”

Behind me, the writer flipped the journal open wider with a slow, satisfied whisper of paper.

A final sentence wrote itself:

“Only one version exits the building tonight.”

The doubles at the hallway’s end moved in unison, forming a silent wall.
The vent double dropped onto the floor with a wet thud behind me.
The standing hallway double stepped to my side.

All smiling.

All ready.

The writer raised the pen and pointed it at us.

“It’s simple,” he said. “Choose who stays real. The script needs one. Only one.”

My heart pounded against my ribs.

My broken double grabbed the stairwell railing and whispered:

“Choose me. Choose the version who remembers.”

The writer tapped the pen again.

A new line appeared in the journal:

“He chooses wrong.”

I felt a snap inside my head.

A recoil.

A rebellion.

Like my mind slammed the brakes on a destiny someone else was driving.

“No,” I whispered.

The writer paused.

The pen hovered.

“What did you say?” he asked.

I looked at the broken version of me, shaking in the stairwell.

Then I looked at the copies behind me — polished, eerie, waiting for instruction.

My voice cracked, but it didn’t break:

“I choose none of us.”

The hallway went silent.

Utterly still.

Even the light stopped flickering.

The writer slowly lowered the pen.

“That isn’t an option,” he said.

“It is,” I said, stepping backward into the stairwell with the broken double.
“Because none of us fit your script.”

He tilted his head, expression flattening.

“You don’t get to decide that.”

I grabbed the stairwell door and slammed it shut between us.

The journal in my hand spasmed — pages thrashing like something trapped in them was clawing to get out.

But the final line refused to change.

The writer banged on the door.

Once.
Twice.
A third time.

His voice seeped through like oil:

“Come back. The story isn’t finished.”

I took the broken version of me by the arm.

“We finish it ourselves,” I whispered.

We ran.

Down the stairs.
Faster than I thought I could move.

I heard the doubles pounding against the stairwell door above us.

I heard something crawling in the walls beside us.
I heard the writer calling after us, voice growing distorted, desperate, inhuman:

“STOP. THE SCRIPT ISN’T WRITTEN THAT WAY. YOU CAN’T RUN—YOU DON’T HAVE A PAGE FOR THIS.”

But we kept running.

Because for the first time since I found that journal—

The words didn’t predict me.

They didn’t control me.

They didn’t know what came next.

The stairwell door at the bottom led to the outside.

Cold night air blasted over us.

He hesitated — the broken me.

“What if we’re both wrong?” he whispered.

I squeezed his arm.

“Then at least we get to choose.”

We stepped outside.

And behind us, the building exhaled—

A long, aching groan of wood and brick.

Like something collapsing in on itself.

Or something waking up.

No more flickering lights.

No more doubles stepping from doorways.

Just silence.

For now.

The journal’s final blank page fluttered in my hand as a new line slowly inked itself in, trembling violently as if struggling to form:

“He leaves.”

Then:

“He leaves…”

And finally:

“…and the script ends here.”

But a faint line — barely visible — bled in beneath it, like something writing from far away:

- The white flower Denji gave Reze is a White Daisy. It means innocence, love at first sight and fresh beginnings. The red flower that Reze is holding at the end and makes her go back to Denji is a Red Daisy, that means deep romantic love, passion, courage and vitality.

- When Reze sees Denji riding Beam, she burst out laughing, wheezing. It's recurring that Reze can't hold her laughter at any of Denji's jokes. At the beach, she burst out laughing, and immediately copes out saying that all her actions were a lie. She was doing a desperate lie in an attempt to keep Denji away from her, safe.

- Reze is shown to be a horrible liar. Even at the Special Division 2 Trainning Center, she couldn't even put a decent performance to fool anyone. It ties to the end, that she couldn't even hold the lie that she didn't care about Denji, a fact that Denji immediately disputed and she couldn't even back up.

- When Reze is singing her lullaby, it shows Makima drinking coffee, then looking out the window, and nodding her cup in rithim with Reze's song. She was drinking coffee that late just because it was the same drink Reze gave Denji, and her nodding the cup was because she was listening to them.

- Reze cut Denji's tongue mid kiss and after because she got jealous. She confessed to Denji, and he rejected her. It was her first time experiencing love, jealousy and rejection, so she falled back on what she knew: violence and her mission.",81,1765451888.0,ChainsawMan,8,0.99,False

You know it’s funny working nights.
Any job that makes you do so in solitary can have an effect on your mind if you’re not careful.

I never paid attention to being careful before.

I just put my headphones in and cleaned.
I arrived at the normal time for each building.

I have one of them hoover commercial backpacks you see the new cleaners wear.

I got mine last week.

I look like a professional Ghostbuster now.
If only I knew how apt that was.

There’s this one building on my route that I always get to around 02:40-ish.
It’s a huge big white building in the corner of Jury Street.

Jury Street – I have no idea if it is a coincidence – but the building is at least 200 years old and the building is full of legal correspondence.

It’s linked to the courts where today something as trivial as a petty fraud all the way back to 200 years ago when a murder was a sentencing for the gallows.
I could never tell if this place was giving me the creeps or if I was secretly in awe.

There are things in life even we as a human race have done, though awful – they are still pretty magnificent to look at from afar.

I got there for 02:39; I was on time.

I got my keys out and opened the main doors.
I quickly fixed the security before the alarms went berserk and went to work.

When I had reached the back of the first floor and wiped everything down—I did what I always do.

I went out the fire door to have a sneak glass of whisky and a pre-made rolled-up cigarette.

This was my last haunt before heading home and I liked to take my time.

I didn’t have anyone apart from my tortoise to go back to.

Just me and Esio.

I named him that from a Roald Dahl book I was lent.

That’s when I was learning English.

Lots of books as presents that year.

I preferred the pictures but that story about a tortoise stuck with me and that little guy makes me want to go back home.

Especially now, it was cold tonight; there was nothing special about the sky, everything else was normal.

I liked the quiet.

I was used to the quiet.

It was the cold I could never get used to.

I flicked my cigarette and as it landed, a peculiar thing—flames.

I thought at first it was the whisky I was drinking.

Had I spilt some?

I didn’t need to ask these questions for even a nanosecond before the flames turned into a big triangle.

I ran inside and grabbed a bucket I used for the windows, filled it with water and rushed to throw it over the flames that were still ignited outside.

I wasn’t so much worried but the last thing I needed was to get caught out in my nightly “coffee” breaks.

I locked the back fire door shut and headed to the second floor.
It was dim up here.

I had the option to make it brighter but I hated that electric light they used in the winter days when I’ve walked past before a shift.

The only thing I didn’t like was how this dim light reminded me of when I was a kid in hospital.

I forgot to drink water and started seeing patterns so my mum dragged me to the hospital.

Hospitals at night are the strangest of places.

I remember waking up at midnight—scared, alone and small—wanting my mum.

Forgetting she wasn’t there I turned to my right and instead a little girl was next to me clutching a teddy bear.

I asked her what she was doing.

If she was ok.

She didn’t say anything; but she lifted her pyjama top slightly to reveal a great big surgical cut.

She climbed into my bed—slowly—without taking her eyes off mine and after a while of gazing at each other I drifted off into a long sleep.

When I awoke she was gone.

Back upstairs and in one of the main offices I always get a bit weirded out by one of the desks I clean.

Once a month just after payday there’s a Polaroid picture that turns up. It always depicts someone in bed.

It’s always amused me; I assume that person must be hungover and it’s from a corporate work trip.

Each month they get someone else.
I mean it’s a big company.

I’ve seen women with barely anything on.
I’ve seen men with nothing on and sometimes there’s a person in the background.

The odd thing is the lurker always look serious.

Today when I reached the desk I glanced at the Polaroid very quickly as I always did but instead of humorously getting on with it I done a double take.

The person looked a lot like me.

My chest was giving rapid-fire palpitations because the photo was only just developing.

I could see it was me but my face was smooshed in the pillow and on the desk next to me now Esio came to view.

I could see the bed covers too—the floral decoration picked by my grandmother—but that’s not what freaked me out.

The last thing to develop.

The little girl with the teddy bear and the scar.

She wasn’t looking at me in the bed.

She was looking at me now—so was the bear and just as I held my mouth open she smiled and the little bear waved.

I threw the Polaroid back on the desk like it was too hot to touch and ran out into the hallway looking left and right.

I didn’t understand.

If it was just developing who was in the building with me?

Isn’t that crazy though?

The picture was of me and a girl from 23 years ago.

She would be almost 30 now.

Did she cause that fire? 

I’m due home in 45 minutes!

Do I go home, sneakily stay here, or run as far away as possible? 

I started writing this for help but I think I know what I need to do. ",5,1765451292.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

My story from a (M) dumpee. (Apologies in advance for the long post but trying to provide as much context as possible)

I’m at a point where I’m looking for the one to settle with, I met this amazing woman and we had been dating for roughly 3 months, everything was absolutely wonderful, both loving towards one another and open at showing our feelings whilst enjoying our company. Everything was great!

We were open with our past and she told me about her anxiety, also sharing that she had a rough previous 2 long term relationships (one was an alcoholic, the other a bad drug user) I reassured her I wouldn’t cause her any upset like they had done to her before and was here to look after her.

We planned weekends together (including her lovely dog) and would stay over one another’s every so often, whilst still giving one another our own space most of the week. 

I officially asked her out on a night out together about 2 months in, but she declined. (for a reason I can’t remember as I was a bit taken back and just replied with I just wanted to make my intentions clear and she liked that)
It was never brought up again and we carried on like that hadn’t happened and things were the same.

My work sometimes has me away from home so this time I was away for a week, we exchanged messages stating we were missing one another etc. and called eachother a couple of times making plans for when I got back home.
5 days in whilst being away, out of the blue comes a message stating “she wasn’t sure if she was ready for a relationship yet, and wasn’t quite feeling the way she should be about me at this point in and really needed some time and space to think about things” So I agreed to give her that.

Now going from talking every single day to her for 3 months straight, waking up to good morning texts and sleeping to good night texts, to then going to nothing at all from her was so difficult for me as I adore this woman.
I lasted 5 days before I caved and had to message her speaking from my heart about how I truly felt about her and that I would help her in working out whatever was going through her head together and that I wasn’t planning on going anywhere.

She came back appreciative and felt comforted, but still needed space to think etc. so again I give her time and space.

I struggled because I had no idea where I stood or what was going on after my life was suddenly upside down all of a sudden without any notice and she was on my mind all the time. Roughly 5 days later I sent her a warm voice note, just stating there was no expectation or pressure to reply, but purely just wanted to let her know I was thinking about her and that if she needed to know someone cared about her and loved her that this was it, and that I missed her and i’m there if she needed me for anything.

The next day a text comes through: 

“you’re a lovely person, and I’m so glad we met. Unfortunately, my feelings for you aren’t growing in the way they should be. I’ve asked you on many occasions to give me time and space, but your messages have been constant. I know you really care and it really shows, but it has just been too much for me. I think it’s best to leave things here. I hope you can respect my decision x”
 
it’s been 5 days now where I still haven’t replied to that message. It seemed to me that she’d made her decision on us clear as day by the wording at the end, and there was nothing I could say or do to change it, and left nothing really for me to come back to with? (Correct me if I’m wrong?) 

Question is.. now I’ve taken time to sit down and talk with myself and realise I was perhaps selfish for not giving her adequate space, do I reply in way of apologising for that? and state that I was wrong for only thinking with my heart and not my head.. and hope that in time we could meet up for a coffee and a walk and talk about it all together In hopes of reconciling/working it out together?

Or do I accept the fact that’s it.. the end?
Maintaining no further contact/reply as she’s made her decision. whilst holding onto pure hope that absence makes the heart grow fonder for her and as a result maybe there’s a chance I’ll hear from her again now shes got the space she needed?

I treated her with utmost respect, loyalty, kindness, care and affection. I didn’t stray or do anything to upset her. (Probably something she wasn’t used to from prev. Relationships and it scared her perhaps?)

Please help me understand from both a female and male perspective on what I should do going forward and perhaps what’s going on in her mind without getting a reply back from me? as I still adore this woman regardless.",5,1765451074.0,UKrelationshipadvice,12,0.78,False

I work in an outpatient clinic and we dont have gastric US available. 
She didnt have relevant comorbidities, was on hormone replacement therapy and statin. She was on wegovy because her doctor said it was good for heart/liver function etc etc and weighed 120 pounds. Apparently easy airway.
Last meal was already 9 hours apart (one slice of bread and coffee)
I talked to the ophtalmologist and he said he couldnt hold back the procedure and that the surgery would last 30 min (cryopexy)
He suggested I did an awake block with minimal sedation.
I did RSI (remifentanil, prop, roc and gas) and everything went fine (for the simple reason that I find the peribulbar block extremely unconfortable and borderline painful when done awake). And I hate doing ‘minimal sedation’. I think, often times, it does more bad than good. 
She was thin, had a positive anesthetic record, easy airway…
obs: I dont have the cannula for subtenon block in my country, at least I’ve never seen it.
What would you have done? RSI or awake block? Whats is safer for the patient? One colleague even asked me why I was preparing for general instead of just blocking.
I dont know, I always think I would absolutely hate receiving a peribulbar block while awake…

O Levels finished around a month ago...and inaction has somewhat defined that period.

It's certainly demotivating for me, funny enough. Half of the things I was looking forward to do after exams were over (e.g. gaming, watching movies) are null and void either because the devices for it broke (like my former computer), or because I don't think my parents would uhh...approve of it at all, per se.

The other half...well it's kinda complicated?

For volunteering, not only do I feel like my parents would kill me if I was spending time doing that instead of getting a job (will elaborate on that later), but at the same time...I've either been too lazy to find opportunities on LinkedIn and [giving.sg](http://giving.sg), or i simply couldnt find any opportunities (at that time) that fit my skillsets and that i was old enough for...admittedly, thats kinda on me

For working, although i really do want to get one for the obvious reasons, how i go about it is, well...not what they want. See, I want to venture into specific outlets (eg McDonalds, KFC, etc) that i'm familiar with, and I was like, nope, im not going into somewhere like Starbucks or Luckin Coffee. I prioritised both how good of a working experience i could get, and money, of course. But...my parents absolutely scolded me for this, making comparisons to the real job market (ie your employers choose YOU, not YOU choose the employers, and that the job market is competitive and ruthless), treating as if my and their points are mutually exclusive. and then they just absolutely began scolding me for not getting a job earlier...

look, i know they want me to prepare me for 'the real world' and I won't deny any of their claims. It would be extremely foolish to just do so without justification, and without job experience. however, they way they went about this was just...no. sometimes i just want to crack and do something insane because of their focus of 'preparing me for the future' over stuff like my health (something which they have explicitly said before), and they way they have scolded and shouted at me before. and...i just want to enjoy the holidays. am i justified in thinking that? im honestly not too sure. 

as for studies yeah im pretty keen on doing something insane as well: study 20 HOURS of H2 math within 72 hours. though ive been procrastinating on it for some time.

finally, something more recent - o levels. they're over, but i just wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, worrying about getting anything worse than raw 12. even though ive worked myself to exhaustion in august and early september, towards the end, i began to trip and study quite a bit less, even though i legit wanted to study so badly, so badly so that i thought about causing myself physical pain to motivate me to study. and i kinda worry now that that may have caused a ton of atrophy...i really, really want to do well...even more than my parents, funny enough.

well, thats all i gotta rant about. im back at sgexams and will prob be more active in it in the coming days. bye!",3,1765450057.0,SGExams,3,1.0,False

Anyways, if you are running EG1 ultra burr, common fear is it can’t grind fine enough for espresso. Boy was I wrong about that.

On my first pull of this black & white Christmas candy, experimented with 25s pre infusion and an accidental total of 3 minute pull to get 16g in & 50g out (was aiming for 50 sec total), but its weirdly good. This is already with paper filter on top and bottom. The amaretto taste caught me off guard in a good way. But the biggest lesson to share here is that EG1 ultra (supposedly brew burr) is an amazing espresso puller as well, if any, preferable to me than the Core. Zero bitterness, minimum acidity punch (not everyone likes this, but I do enjoy less acidic shots to find other flavors), and yet flavor bombs came through. Before this shot, most shots are just normal, borderline underwhelming.

Everybody is staring at everybody.

Back in 2017, I had a perfect month. I followed every rule. My equity curve was a smooth line going up.

Then came the last Friday of the month. I took a trade at 10:00 AM. It lost. No big deal.

I took another at 10:30 AM. It lost.

By 2:00 PM, I wasn't trading anymore. I was gambling. I was clicking buttons like a rat in a cage trying to get a pellet of food.

When the market closed at 4:00 PM, my account was flat. I had erased 20 trading days of hard work in 6 hours.

I felt sick. I thought I was greedy. I thought I had no self-control.

You are not greedy. You are suffering from ""Ego Depletion.""

You are trying to run a marathon at a sprint pace, and your brain physically ran out of fuel.

Here is the deep dive on why your brain turns to mush after 2 hours of trading, and why you cannot ""focus"" your way out of it.

**The 35,000 Decisions**

Scientists estimate that the average adult makes about 35,000 decisions every single day.

Most of these are small. What socks do I wear? Coffee or tea?

But in trading, every decision is high-stakes. Entry? Stop loss? Partial profit? Hold?

This creates a phenomenon called Decision Fatigue.

Your ability to make good choices is not infinite. It is a biological battery. Every time you make a choice to follow your rules, you drain that battery. This concept is known in psychology as Ego Depletion.

When that pool of energy is low, you don’t just get tired. You change.

System 1 vs. System 2 (The Brain Switch)

Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman proved that your brain has two modes:

1. System 2: Slow, logical, good at math. This is the trader you are at 9:30 AM.

2. System 1: Fast, emotional, instinctive. This is the gambler you become at 3:00 PM.

System 2 is expensive to run. It burns a lot of energy. When you are trading, you are forcing System 2 to work overtime.

Once your mental battery hits 20%, your brain automatically shuts down System 2 to save energy. It switches to System 1.

You are literally not the same person in the afternoon.

When you are in System 1, you cannot do math. You act on impulse. You buy because a green candle looks fast. You move your stop loss because you are scared.

The ""Battery Drain"" of Losses

It gets worse if you are losing.

Processing a loss isn't just sad; it is an energy drain.

• Analyzing a chart drains about 5% of your battery.

• Taking a loss drains 10%.

• Fighting the urge to revenge trade drains 30%.

By the time you are down two trades, your mental battery is in the red. You are chemically incapable of following your rules.

How Pros Fix This (The Hard Stop)

Professional firms do not tell their traders to ""focus harder."" They know that is biologically impossible.

Instead, they use Kill Switches.

A Kill Switch is a hard-coded rule in the risk management software.

• Max Daily Loss: If a trader loses $X, the software locks the account. They cannot trade again until tomorrow.

• Time Limits: Many algos are programmed to stop trading after a certain number of hours because the data shows human performance drops off a cliff after 120 minutes.

They don't trust the trader. They trust the code.

The Solution: Remove the Decision

You cannot ""willpower"" your way through Decision Fatigue. You have to remove the need to make decisions.

1. The ""One-Shot"" Rule: If you break your rules once, you are done for the day. No second chances.

2. Hard Daily Stops: Call your broker. Tell them to put a hard loss limit on your account. Make it so you cannot revenge trade even if you want to.

3. Trade Less: The more you stare at the chart, the faster you drain your battery. Use price alerts. Do not sit there watching every tick.

Your failure wasn't a lack of talent. It was biological exhaustion.

You tried to use a depleted brain to fight a supercomputer.

I spent years blowing accounts because I thought I could trade all day. Now, I use systems that lock me out before my brain turns to mush.
