1la6vlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpackinghabits/comments/1la6vlx/first_time_trying_habit_stacking_to_change_my/,First time trying habit stacking to change my commute route,"I recently realized I've been taking the same route to work every single day for years, even though I pass by like a zillion other roads. 🚗 It's become one of those autopilot habits I didn't even notice I had. So, I decided to try a little habit stacking to shake things up. 

The idea was to pair the act of checking traffic reports with my morning coffee ritual. As soon as I took that first sip, I'd check the best route on my phone. It started off a bit rocky tho—sometimes I was just too groggy to remember! 🙈 But slowly, it turned into a routine. I found some backroads that actually save me time on days when traffic is heavy. Plus, these new routes are giving me fresh scenery, and I stumbled upon a cute cafe I didn't know existed!

In a way, it's not just about saving a few minutes (although that's nice). It's more about being open to change and realizing how small tweaks can shift your perspective. I've always thought of myself as someone who likes routine, but now I'm seeing the value in mixing things up once in a while. Anyone else tried changing up a daily routine this way? I'd love to hear more tips or just share experiences on this! 😊",1,1749788286.0,unpackinghabits,0,1.0,False

She is a bum who can never hold a job and always asking family members for money while constantly having enough money to buy marijuana carts, speciality drinks from coffee shops, fast food, and junk food. She over the past 2 years she has asked every family member for money to pay her rent, I (33 M) paid it twice and she put both her dad and grandmother into debt from giving her money. And after all that she was still evicted for non payment of rent. 

When we bought our house my wife (31 F) insisted that her sister move in with us while she finishes school to help her out until she graduates in November. I was against it knowing she would contribute nothing to the household financially while consuming resources that I would ultimately be footing the bill for. But you know how that goes and she moved in. 

Fast forward 4 months and like I knew would happen she has not paid the one utility and one monthly grocery trip once like agreed but instead buys junk food and soda for herself while eat the food that I buy. Always has a full cart in her pen. Skips school so much her graduation has been pushed back to March. She has ""had"" two jobs but didn't show up on her first day to either. And I just found out she's been asking her dad for money. 

I'm fed up with it and I told my wife she needs to go, because I will no longer contribute to her laziness and and spending habits. AITAH?

1la6sxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/seedstorage/comments/1la6sxw/best_seed_storage_ideas/,BEST SEED STORAGE IDEAS,"Many very good ways to store. I advised a unique client in Virginia today to write down his 12 and 24 word key phrases identically to what's provided for backup. I also provided him a quiz showing examples and then giving him five examples to review that All looked the same. For example:
fishes boring hired indigo horses purple angry downside snakes coffee italian boating 

I said to review this: 

Fishes boring hired indigo horses purple angry downside snakes coffee italian boating

Did you find any errors or was this example an accurate copy of the very specific and totally unforgiving 12 word Recovery Key Phrase for a very popular Self Custodial Wallet? 

He said the first example would work and was ready for another test. 

I immediately advised him that his entry would illicit a COMPLETE 100 PERCENT FAILURE and wouldn't ever open his Crypto Wallet with over 200k in Bitcoin. Even with password and signing in information and 2 factor this would come back as total fail and he would never have access to his money he has saved for 9 years. 

I advised him that he was a fail immediately as he capitalized ""fishes"" which creates a complete failure. 

Another maybe easier example:

fishes boring hired indigo horses purple angry downside snakes coffee  italian boating

Would this twelve word key phrase allow total recovery and access to his hard earned crypto?

He responded, ""Thought you got me but this one will work as all of the words are correct and not capitalized like presented in the backup key phrase posting!""

I advised this would be a 100 percent complete failure with no access to his wallet ever based on incorrect input. He checked again and said I was still worth the $99 consult, by far, but I was incorrect. 
Immediately I told him his small investment for my private security consulting was a great value at a Groupon rate. However he created a total failure again and he would never get access. 

I advised him earlier about copying this phrase identically and give through word by word to avoid any oversight or misspelled word, etc. Again he said I made a mistake. I told him he could try this and I would give him $100 if it worked and if it didn't my consult would be for a small amount of $199 which is the lowest I've ever seen from a longtime security advisor in crypto. 

I told him to refer to those words and count to make certain he included all 12 words and they were spelled correctly and in order I presented. He took twenty minutes to review thoroughly and allowed his college aged son to help him. I advised that these phrases shouldn't be shared. Rather he could print to his printer 2 copies and place in sealed envelope into one of the many inexpensive fireproof document  safes I've tested and approved of. One of them should be placed into a lockbox in the bank safe where he also has Fiat products. I told him to secure the key and lockbox password and to always access the box in total private and when inside the bank vault. 

He thought he didn't find any errors so I pointed him to the 12 words, specifically the 10th through 12th. Here is a copy below:
fishes boring hired indigo horses purple angry downside snakes coffee  italian boating

I asked him to look at the word ""coffee"" and verify accuracy of spelling and any capitalizations. I then told him to COUNT THE SPACES between ""coffee"" and ""italian""and notice 1 extra space separating those words. He thought it was fine otherwise and I advised this is a one hundred percent complete FAILURE! 

I CONTINUED WITH THREE MORE AND HE FINALLY GOT THE LAST ONE CORRECT. Without perfection he would NEVER EVER gain access to restoring his Coinbase Wallet and many have lost billions from simple errors! 

He restored his wallet to full working order and then I provided my XLM public address on my LOBSTR wallet and within minutes he properly copied my unique personal address for my XLM or Stellar Account from the email I sent him with the invoice and he pasted MY ADDRESS:
GD4LOTNDJAMEIYRGLAONBR7UDQYYZ3KPEFDOQMY46VFNQ5ULICODJI7Q

And kindly sent me USD $500 for my services and a tip. He clicked SEND and was provided the transaction ID or HASH and in under 2 minutes I received $500 in XLM that he sent from his newly restored COINBASE WALLET and transferred into my RECEIVE Wallet Address for XLM. A TOTAL OF $500 so accurately and rapidly transferred from his accrued Bitcoin monies, over $200,000.00 that he almost gave up on afte not getting the current education on properly restoring using the twelve word seed phrase. Long ago when he first set up his Coinbase Wallet I told him to write those 12 words in Sharpee marker on the old curtains he had hanging in his very old home and told me he'd never replace them. I had him undo the button hem then copy those words onto the material. Also I had him write it on the inside material of his hunting boots that no one would ever dream to look at or try on but that I could remember. He got my PUBLIC WALLET DEPOSIT ADDRESS OF
GD4LOTNDJAMEIYRGLAONBR7UDQYYZ3KPEFDOQMY46VFNQ5ULICODJI7Q
and said I made him the happiest dad and husband in the entire world and he would have paid much more but I'm too nice!

1la6qsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/canceledpod/comments/1la6qsj/i_dont_think_brooke_and_tana_hate_each_other/,I don’t think Brooke and Tana hate each other,"Controversial I know. But I feel like once the pod is over in a couple of months they will still be friends. I think ever since they moved studios and left the OG couch and became more produced the vibes have changed to something more professional. I also think they are at SUCH different places in their lives than they were say 1 year ago. They are both in happy relationships spending a lot of time with their boyfriends (this is not about if u like Brooke’s bf or not this is just a fact). And naturally when you are in love it’s not that you don’t like your friends anymore and u never hang out with them but ur time gets allocated differently. I think they are both scared of getting cancelled again and this podcast leads them to be more susceptible to that. I think Brooke more so, but also I feel like Tana would have an existential crisis if she got into an actual controversy right now during this peace era of her life and would make her more likely to crash out or like think about breaking sobriety. They need to live their lives for a little bit and find their own way without this podcast and who knows maybe they will miss it and not be so burnt out from filming and touring and will come back to it in a few months/years. But I don’t think they hate each other. I just think this podcast puts a lot of stress on their friendship. I don’t think I would want to work full time with one of my (best) friends either tbh. It’s like how they say you shouldn’t live with your best friends because it will bring conflict into your relationship. You know them as a fun caring person you like to go out with and like get coffee with or something but then you learn they don’t know how to clean and leave messes everywhere. And all of a sudden you’re mad at them for being such a slob, something you wouldn’t have found out otherwise, and if you did know it is affecting you differently than it was before. Working that closely or being with someone so much puts stress on the relationship 99% of the time, especially if you didn’t initially meet that way. I think the podcast started as them talking about drama and exposing people and relationships and raunchy things in their lives. But in the most recent episode Tana made it clear. She hates when things in the past come back and she has to explain herself or apologize (ie. the Catherine situation, or even something little like her just saying she doesn’t think ari and gravy are actually dating). And coming online every week and having to talk in long form content will allow that to happen more often. She is in a different era of life and has realized what is important to her and what brings her peace. This is one of the last things tying her to old Tana and she wants to be done with it. So no, I don’t think Brooke and Tana hate each other. I think they just need a break and need to have some stress free, non working, no cameras, good old fashion girl friend time. Because who would want to hang out with someone they have seen for 10 hours that week already??? ",2,1749787833.0,canceledpod,0,0.67,False
1la6p5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1la6p5u/god_you_see_me/,"""God you see me""","that night I sat in a back alley cafe in Paris

the sound of dishes and conversation 
filled the lively atmosphere

I could pick out bits of conversation
I still didn't speak French all that well 

but I knew I was surrounded by love

sitting in that cafe 

alone
Longing for a love of my own

like a spot of grey on a white canvas

after I finished my coffee I paid the bill and left

as I walked down those Paris alleys 
seeing all the smiles 

a tear slipped down my cheek

I let out a prayer:

""God you see me
please don't leave me
I know I've been gone a while
but if you're there
please don't leave me
in this pit I of dark despair
send someone
someone to lead me 
someone with all this beauty
I could share
someone to love 
someone to hold 
but more importantly
someone to lead me back to you""

I wanna say it was about a quarter of an hour later I was walking the Paris streets

it was quite beautiful that night 

the perfect temperature with a slight breeze

as I walked I saw a lady standing

all alone so pretty and fair

she said I looked lonely and asked if 
she could walk with me

we went down to the river 

we walked the Seine
the music and lights 
illuminated the scene

there were laughs and stories

of two lives waiting to be shared 

as we saw the sun start to peek over the hills 
she invited to follow her

we walked a short distance to a small church

that was ten years ago 

now we are expecting our first child
 
a baby girl named Alya 

now I'm reminded of that night 
in mid July of 1952 

when God saw me 

and made my dreams come true

Hi! I'm trying to remember the title of a children’s novel I read years ago, probably set in the UK. It’s a realistic story told in third-person, about a girl (around 12 years old probably??) who travels the country with her stepfather, who is a lorry driver.

Their relationship starts off rocky, but as they spend more time on the road together, they gradually grow closer. They sleep in the lorry at night, and one memorable scene includes them eating together at a roadside diner. I recall scenic descriptions as they drive through different parts of the country.

The mother is also in the story, but only in some parts.

The cover image was illustrated and felt very nostalgic—it showed the girl and her stepfather sitting in the diner, while other customers were seated around them sipping coffee or eating. The art style was grainy or soft, kind of cozy and vintage-looking.

There’s no fantasy, no hijacking, no dramatic crime—just a quiet, emotional story about family, connection, and life on the road.

If anyone remembers this, I’d be so very grateful. It’s been stuck in my head for years!",1,1749787489.0,whatsthatbook,1,0.99,False

1la6mrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1la6mrx/dedicated_writeup_241_274_in_35_weeks/,Dedicated Write-up: 241 --> 274 in 3.5 weeks,"**I know each write-up is valuable and another data point for everyone to think about their own study strategy, but as a preface, this is a write-up that might be most helpful for those who:**

**1. Don’t really use Anki,**

**2. Have limited time for Dedicated for one reason or another (my reason was that I didn’t want to be on Dedicated for more than a month)**

The one write-up I found really helpful in developing my study plan was from [brate52](https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1ctjag8/dedicated_writeup_244_279_in_5_weeks/), so definitely give theirs a read. I followed a lot of their Dedicated recommendations (aside from Anki-related things).



I’m a US MD student, not a T20 school.



**Third year studying for clerkship/shelf exams**: my standardized way to study was doing all the UWorld questions, taking NOTES (for me, it was in one PPT deck – i.e., a 300-slide Peds deck that I just created as I went through the questions, and other shelves had similar slide decks). Also, I didn’t use Anki in the way it was intended, rather I used it as a reference. I did pay for AnkiHub because they have excellent cards and continuous updates. During each clerkship, I took all the NBME shelf practice tests for a given subject (except for medicine, we have a home-grown medicine exam). I did well in my shelf exams, with a range of 85-94% correct.



During Dedicated, my **day-to-day study schedule** was admittedly long study days:

Wake up 7-8am, eat breakfast

Take 2-3 blocks of 40 Q (or a practice test), so it would be 80 or 120 Q per day

Take a break – lunch, work-out, etc

Review my blocks (takes 2-3 hours per block), taking notes on stuff I missed, and usually some focused studying of topics (I referenced my own shelf-studying PPT notes)

Dinner

Finish anything I didn’t finish reviewing, or do something to relax

Bed by 10pm

\+ 1 fun half-day activity per week (usually on the weekend), like a gathering with friends or something



**Practice questions**: I did UWorld (only 1 run-through), and I supplemented with Amboss as needed. Basically after I finished all UWorld, about halfway through my Dedicated, I spent more time working on the weaknesses (per my NBME practice tests) through Amboss focused question banks. I made a running Biostats notes document (because after you learn the concepts and do a lot of practice questions on these, they SHOULD be easy points).



**Practice tests**: Do as many as you can, in a realistic timed setting (yes, time your breaks), and take each only once!! There is no benefit to repeating any practice test, because the idea is that you use them for 1) predictive value, and 2) review of topics you got wrong. I also had a running list of basically WHY I got a question wrong for each incorrect NBME or UWSA question, so I could also improve my test-taking strategy – i.e., “read too quickly”, “switched my answer”, “they were asking for x and I was thinking y”, etc. I tried to learn from my past test-taking mistakes with each practice test.

NBME 10: 241 (24 days out – first day of Dedicated)

NBME 11: 251 (20 days out)

NBME 13: 254 (16 days out)

UWSA 1: EPC 84% (13 days out)

NBME 14: 259 (10 days out)

2020 new 120: 89% (8 days out)

NBME 15: 271 (7 days out)

2023 free 120: 85%; UWSA 2: EPC 91%; one medicine NBME (4 days out) – these were all on the same day; this was my “true run-through” where I gave myself the allotment of 45min + remainder of 15-min tutorial time I didn’t use after writing down my equations.

\^for the UWSAs I have a record of the EPC but not the estimated translated score; I wrote those down my estimated scores somewhere that I need to find, so I will update that  when I do

 

**Podcasts**: since my time was relatively short, I didn’t spend too much time on the popular review podcasts/videos (Divine Intervention, Emma review series). I did listen to some Spotify playlists that I found when I looked up Divine High Yield, and listened to them on some neighborhood jogs/walks in the last couple of days prior to my exam. I do have copies of all of Emma’s PPTs but I didn’t look at all of them, I used them as an additional study review source material when I got NBME practice questions wrong.

 

**Timing**: Timing is very important on the exam, because sometimes you have to make the mental decision of whether to think a little more (even 30s is a long time for a 1hr block, as we know), or move on. As other people have mentioned, you need to learn to commit to an answer, and not try to talk yourself into other answers – after all, anything IS possible, but the test doesn’t care about anything and everything, just the most likely scenario.



**Stamina for an 8-hr exam**: You should definitely try to do ONE TRUE run-through with the appropriate break time and number of questions. It will be hard, but it’s worth giving yourself more info about how you operate in this type of setting. These will be person-specific. I took away a few points about myself from my true run-through, like if I drink 2 cups of coffee, my stomach will hurt halfway through my 5^(th) block, lol. Also, protein bars are great, but I also needed some snack with salt in it (those squares of salted seaweed was my preference). And definitely poop at home before the exam.



And finally, like brate52 mentioned, make sure you have a good nights’ sleep (the method of waking up at like 5am the day before to work out had worked for me); bring enough snacks; and take every break you can between each and every block. It’s annoying to need to do the security thing every time, but it honestly gave me a great mental reset. During the breaks, I either had a snack + a sip of a beverage, went to the restroom, or I did some stretches. I also suggest bringing your own earplugs, a jacket for variable testing AC, and eye-drops for when your eyes are dry – staring at a screen for that long can be painful.



That’s all I can think of for now! Godspeed, and if you have questions, feel free to post below or DM me, I’ll answer as many as I can between pts tomorrow!",1,1749787464.0,Step2,1,1.0,False

He’s always been steady. He sailed through their first kid’s newborn chaos. But since the second came along (she’s two now), something’s changed. He spends evenings alone in the driveway, just sitting in the car with the engine off. He moved into the spare room “so I don’t keep my wife up,” but it feels more like retreat than courtesy. During the day he texts “All good"", without any unusual signs.

I’m scared this is more than normal dad stress. He won’t bring it up with his wife, and I don’t want to bulldoze him, but I also don’t want to wait for another 2 am call.

For parents (or anyone who’s been the worried sibling): what actually helped you when the fear and isolation took over? How do I start the conversation about therapy or support without making him shut down? Any ideas welcome; I just want my brother present and okay for his kids.

**Edit #1:** I read every single comment, thank you! The message is loud and clear: that 2 a.m. call was a SOS, not “dad stress”. I’m flying out **Tonight** (waiting for the weekend felt dumb).

Plan is simple: over breakfast I’m going to ask him straight up: “Are you thinking about killing yourself?”, if the answer is even close to a yes, we’ll call 988 or go to a doctor together. Then I’ll drag him outside the house to do something he used to love, maybe golf, maybe steakhouse or a bad action movie, just to let his brain breathe and create rooms for him to open up. At some point, I’ll loop his wife in gently so she’s not in the dark.

Ticket is booked. He thinks I’m in town for work. I’ll keep you posted. Thanks for pushing me off the couch.

*~~UPDATE #1: Got to his place, he smiled when he opened the door. My tears almost slipped out, but I held it together. Low key catch up tonight and real talk tomorrow, will be back with updates.~~*

*~~booked a flight, confronting him tomorrow~~*

**Update #2: I flew out and I’m camped on my brother’s couch. Big midnight porch confession—debt, depression, the whole lot. If you want the full rundown (and some questions I need help with) it’s** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1kssgw3/update_im_camped_on_my_brothers_couch_after_his_2/)

**Thanks again—your advice got me on the plane.**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** PPD is also a thing for dads

> **OOP:** PPD was my first thought too. Problem is, in his town “dads don’t get depressed,” so reaching out looks like weakness. Resources are basically nil. Super frustrating. If anyone knows legit dad-friendly help, please drop it.

**Commenter 2:** If my brother called me at 2am like this, I'd be asking my wife to watch my daughter for a couple days and booking a flight out to visit.

I'd probably take him out for drinks and beat the explanation of how he was feeling out him.

If I felt pretty confident that he wasn't actually as critically unstable as he seemed in the 2am call, I might put the trip off for a few days. If he wanted, I'd make some excuse about having business in the area, but I wouldn't avoid the visit.

The dude needs someone to talk to if he's breaking down like this at 2am. Could be anything from financial stress to just plain old chemical depression.

> **OOP:** Thanks for the reality check, you’re right, I can’t just chalk that call up to stress. He’s always been the family rock, so seeing him crack like that was a gut punch. I’m lining up a visit ASAP, no big agenda, just showing up and letting him talk. Appreciate the push, Reddit brother.

**OOP on knowing if her brother drinks or not to cope with his depression**

> **OOP:** It never occurred to me he could be drinking on the side. I’m his sister, so getting a guy’s perspective on how men sometimes hide this stuff is really helpful. I’m flying out this weekend so he’s not alone with the spiral. Really appreciate the advice.
> 
> Do you think he will be honest with me if I ask him about the drinking issue?

**Commenter 3:** Is the 2nd kid his? I'd wonder if he found something out that made him separate from his wife intentionally since the birth...

> **OOP:** I did not think of that. He did ask me to take care of his little one (2nd kid), my assumption is unlikely, but there's definitely some issue with their relationship.

**Commenter 4:** Lurking mom here; as someone who has had very severe depression, with suicidal ideation and put plans in place, this is worthy of a five alarm siren. Your brother needs your help NOW. I cannot tell you how bad it had to be for me to reach out for help; I am always outwardly steady and very good at hiding my depression. You need to, as someone else said, beat the explanation of how he is feeling out of him. Do not allow yourself to be shrugged off and do not let him act like it’s not a big deal or you are overreacting.

> **OOP:** Big props to you for speaking up, your honesty is the wake-up call I needed. Thank you.

**OOP should help look into getting therapy for her brother**

> **OOP:** He’s pretty therapy-shy, so I’m looking for softer on-ramps, maybe a standing coffee walk with a dad buddy, or maybe there's an app with check-in like “Not OK""? Anything that feels like hanging out rather than sitting on a couch in the therapist's office. If you’ve got other low-key ideas, I’m all ears.

**OOP needs to follow her gut feelings from that 2AM phone call, likely the call for help**

> **OOP:** My inner voice was telling me that this is not the typical thing, thank you for the validation, I'm booking the ticket now.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/s/pUZ1huqUJg): **May 22, 2025 (three days later)**

*My brother called me at 2am: ""If I don’t make it, promise you’ll raise my kids."" So I flew across the country. Now I’m on his couch, and here’s what I just learned:*

Last night we wound up on his back porch around midnight, baby monitor humming between us. It was quiet for a long stretch, then he started talking, and the words poured out, pretty soon we were both wiping our eyes.

He’s embarrassed I flew across the country to “babysit” him, but even more scared about what would happen to his kids if he ever hit the point of no return. His business is buried in debt and a few clients still haven’t paid, so every bill feels like a gut punch.

Home is tense too. He took clients to a strip club on a work trip, told his wife right away so there were no secrets, tried to be close later and she pulled back. He says that felt like the biggest humiliation of his life, and now he freezes whenever things might turn intimate.

Back in February he went to his PCP because he couldn't sleep. The doctor ran a quick screen, called it severe depression, and put him on meds. He didn’t tell anyone, because “talking to a stranger won’t fix it” and he figured he could muscle through. Meanwhile he feels responsible for his wife, the kids, our parents, even me. At one point he said, “I can’t breathe.” The only thing that yanks him out of dark thoughts is his toddler’s face in the morning.

I pulled out my phone and showed him this Reddit thread: thousands of strangers pacing over his 2 am call. He shakes his head and laughs: “I felt bad stressing *you* out—now the whole internet’s sweating over me.” A bit of the weight slid off right there.

Then I reminded him how many times I’d drafted him as my bodyguard while growing up, chasing off boys I didn’t like and listening to me cry when the ones I liked didn’t like me back. We cracked up at how he’s been my unofficial relationship therapist forever while insisting he’s “bad at feelings.” That laugh felt good, but one porch talk isn’t a cure.

So here’s my ask:

\* Therapy-averse dads or moms who finally went: What flipped the switch for you?

\* Depression survivors: What was the very first step that gave you air?

\* 2 am panic veterans: When you couldn’t call anyone, what kept you from tipping over?

Short answers, long stories, whatever helps. This sub already got me on a plane, maybe you’ll get him to real daylight.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Not directly what you asked about, but if he has clients that aren't paying, assuming he's a contractor or freelancer, and he has some documentation, he can absolutely take them to small claims court over it.

I have an acquaintance who did this, he was getting stiffed by a two clients, a small business and another mid sized local business, and he sent them notice they were late and that he'd be taking them to court in 7 days. One paid up immediately on the threat, the other didn't, he represented himself in small claims court, the judge found in his favor, end of story.

Obviously this might feel like an extra thing to take on, and he'd need to do some research, but it could help relieve some financial stress.

Small claims court is underrated, you can even sue large companies there in some cases

> **OOP:** This is helpful, thank you! I'll pass this along to my brother.

**Commenter 2:** I was therapy adverse. I realized that I don’t go for me, I go for my kid. I want to be better and have a better grasp on issues so I can model it for my kids.

I want a healthy relationship with boundaries, self image, money, etc, because my folks didn’t and I see all that in me. I want to stamp it out at me, it ends with my generation.

Tell your brother, if his toddlers face is the only thing that pulls him out of the dark, make it so that the dark disappears as much as it can and the burden isn’t on his kid. It’s not his kids job to get him through. It’s his job. Talking is helpful. Have him talk to his wife more about what happened and how he feels about how she treated him.

> **OOP:** ""It’s not his kids job to get him through. It’s his job."" - I think that will speak to him. Thank you.

**Commenter 3:** Dad, physician and therapist activist.

I know it may feel like ""talking to a stranger""... Because that's what it is... In the beginning. A few things to understand - you have to find the right person for you. I realized that I would prefer a male, after seeing 2 women, because they'd relate better to me. Then I realized I'd prefer a younger male over an older male. Then a colored male over a white male. Eventually.. it just clicked. And it becomes a feeling of ""wow.. this person, gets me!""

Then this person gets to know you and can allow you to view these issues in a different light, ask you questions that maybe you haven't thought about and, most importantly, give the tools to help process and heal the thoughts you may have.

You are making REALLY good progress. I commend your commitment and love for your brother, I wish more of my patients had that support system.

Continue what you're doing, continue showing up and continue recommending he find the right therapist for him.

Healing your mental health takes work, it's not an easy fix, and it takes time.

> **OOP:** Appreciate the reminder that finding a therapist is a bit like dating, you keep looking until the fit feels right. Thanks for the encouragement and for spelling out what a good therapist actually brings to the table.

**Editor's Note: the body text for Update #2 was saved before it got removed**

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1kvzx4t/my_brother_called_at_2_am_asking_me_to_raise_his/): **May 26, 2025 (four days later)**

Hey. It’s the sister with the 2am call—back because something wild happened.

*Quick recap for anyone just dropping in*: A few days ago at 2am, my phone lit up. My brother asked if I could take care of his kids if something bad happened. The words sounded practical, the hour felt like a silent goodbye. I came here and told you everything. You answered, hundreds of you.

Last night we read all 700-plus replies together. Each line felt like someone farther up the trail flashing a light back toward us. He set the phone down, shook his head, and said:

He asked me to pass along what landed, his lines and my narration around them.

**1. “How did we all miss the sirens?”**

Thread after thread told the same gut-punch story: brothers cracking jokes at dinner, FaceTiming goodnights—and then gone. Some waved flags (good-bye texts, sudden giveaways). Others wore flawless masks: meds skipped, plans canceled, eyes smiling but empty.

**His takeaway:** Stop betting on “maybe tomorrow.” Ask the blunt question. Knock anyway. Fire off the midnight check-in.

**Mine:** Show up first, hope later. Drag them to the doctor today, not when the calendar clears. One knock at the right moment can keep a life from swinging shut.

**2. Therapy: jack, not tow truck**

He dodged therapy for years—“real men fix flats alone.” Then one analogy finally landed.

**His takeaway:** If you won’t grab a tool for yourself, grab it so your kids don’t grow up thinking silence is strength.

**Mine:** Therapy isn’t a rescue crew; it lifts the frame so you can work. If the first jack slips, swap it and keep going.

**3. Depression never really moves out**

We finally admitted it: depression doesn’t pack its bags. Most of us just learn to walk with the limp while acting like everything’s fine.

Relief looks different for everyone: weights, riffs, sketchbooks, meds, CBT drills, but even the best routine collapses when you’re alone and the limp turns to sludge. Action beats rumination: ping a friend, walk a block, book the labs, anything.

**His takeaway:** Depression wins if I freeze alone. Any motion with people: Lifting, riffing, walking, talking, pumps oxygen back into the day.

**Mine:** Normalize the limp, keep nudging toward motion, and never let anyone walk that limp alone.

**4. The 2 am Kill-Zone**

That’s when the brain rips off its daytime mask and insists the only exit is to stop breathing.

Two refrains echo: “I wish he’d called” and “I had no one to dial.” We’re never true islands, even a lone rock has fish swirling underneath, so reach out when you can’t pull yourself back.

**His takeaway:** When tunnel vision hits, a live voice is the crowbar that pries the door back open.

**Mine:** Build fail-safes before the kill-zone. Keep numbers pinned, plans primed, and remember: if you can’t calm your own storm, send a signal—someone’s awake and willing to steer you till morning.

Why I’m writing (and staying)

I’m typing parts of this in tears because the reality of almost losing my brother finally sank in. Humanity is rare on the internet, but this thread flooded us with it. If these words keep even one more family from that edge, sharing them is a must.

No one should die of lonely suffering. Even a “lone” island isn’t truly alone; life teems beneath the surface. Let’s prove that to anyone who feels stranded.

**What We Still Need — Add Your Piece**

I’m still wiping tears because if I hadn’t acted on what the dads and moms here shared, I might be planning my brother’s funeral right now. Your advice saved him, so I’m leaning in again:

If you’re still in the thick of it:

\-What’s weighing on you right now? Money panic, med roulette, zero support circle, name it so we can all see it.

If you’ve made it to steadier ground:

\-What do you wish you’d done sooner, or wish existed, when things were darkest?
\-What’s actually helped you fight back? A habit, a line, a resource - share the thing that really moved the needle.

Everything you offer will go into a living guide we can all lean on. One late-night thread kept my brother here; together we can keep the next family whole.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** This is why we are here! Y’all made my day just now!

> **OOP:** ❤️❤️ I'm really grateful to come across with all the amazing dads and moms here.

**Commenter 2:** Thank you for taking the time to write this. The referenced discussion was something I missed but I'm glad I clicked on this one.

There's one huge thing that keeps me coming back to this subreddit. To remind myself that I'm not alone when I struggle. Not ever.

> **OOP:** I’m so glad you found this one, and thank you for saying that. That exact feeling, *“I’m not alone”* is what kept me holding it together while writing and reading through tear

**Commenter 3:** This is outstanding progress. Im proud of you both. 

He HAS to fix his business. For small business owners, mental health and the business performance are impossible to seperate. 

He cant do it alone. Just like therapy, he needs to bring in someone that can shine a light where it needs to be. Thats not weakness, thats just being smart and using someone else's skillset. 

You (he) can do this!

> **OOP:** Yes, the business still needs to be figured out, but he can't do it unless he's mentally stable, so one step at a time. Thank you for the support!

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/Xpwj6Etn4m)  **June 3, 2025**

I have no idea how I feel about what he told me. I want to think it’s cute that he cared this much, but it’s just coming off as creepy and I feel lied to. 

He got drunk because we were celebrating my first successful day at my clinicals and he ended up saying something along the lines of “could you believe we wouldn’t be this happy if I hadn’t watched you for so long?” To which I was confused and didn’t know what he meant. Well I had worked at a local library for two years, before we met, during college and apparently he saw me there but didn’t actually  talk to me, he just would watch me and listen in on my conversations with the people I was checking out and my coworkers to figure out what I liked. Then he apparently followed me and found the coffee shop I frequented. 

All this time I thought we had a sweet first time meeting story. He accidentally bumped into me, apologized, and offered to buy me coffee for the trouble. He told me what he was ordering and it was the exact same thing I always get and I thought it was an amazing coincidence, I joked that it was fate and we spent like an hour talking over coffee. I feel so stupid. Apparently it was similar to a scene in a book that I had read and told my coworker I had thought was cute. 

I’m just so frustrated and angry. I feel betrayed, like why would you do this?? And how much of our year and a half relationship is a lie. Like it sounds like he was stalking me

**Edit: Just so we’re all on the same page, I don’t believe he was watching me the whole time I was working there, I think it was the last 6 months or so before I actually met him.**


**He is a bit socially awkward, but he has a group of friends that he plays D&D and hangs out with like once a week.**


**He’s 25 and I’m 22 so it’s not a weird age gap.**


**I have never really considered him going through my phone weird because I basically let anyone look at my phone whenever. I’m not worried about anyone seeing anything.**


**I’ve also never really been worried about my safety with him before, but I do know that he has anger issues and has gotten in trouble for getting into a few physical fights, so for those of you worried about me I will be watching for any signs I might have missed.**


**I mainly am just upset because I feel like our relationship was built on a lie, even if it was a smallish one. He also said he was interested in a lot of the same things I was when we first met and for a while he kept up with them, but lately he hasn’t at all and I’m now wondering if he lied about those things too.**

**I definitely need to have a conversation with him and I’m driving home now so I’ll talk with him when I get there. Thanks for the feedback folks**

**following edit was made by ex** *edit: I was wrong. He has done nothing wrong.*

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**_TOSKA_**

>I'm telling you from experience, and please, please, please don't take my comment and the many others lightly: This guy is a walking red flag. He will try to control you more and more over time.


>First he stalked you (let’s be honest, that’s what it was), then he manipulated you at your first meeting (""oh wow what a coincidence we like the same coffee :3"") to make you think you're somehow soulmates or whatever? Now you live together (how long were you even dating before that??) and he’s already checking your phone. And he guilt trips you for seeing your friends more than once a week.

>Girl, TRUST YOUR GUT. You feel like it’s creepy? That’s because it IS creepy. You feel like he lied to you? That’s because he DID.

>There is absolutely nothing cute about his behavior. Please, please talk to someone you trust. Start gathering your most important documents (passport, etc.) and store them somewhere safe. I promise you: if this is how the relationship started, it’s only going to get worse no matter what sweet lies he tells you, no matter how many times he apologizes, no matter how great the two weeks after an apology feel. It will start all over again. Don’t lie to yourself. Trust your gut. Please!!

**OOP**

>>We were dating for a little over a year before we decided to move in together in a place that close to the hospital where I’m doing my clinicals. I was hesitant to move out there on my own and it seemed like our relationship was really good, I spent a lot of time at his apartment leading up to it. Evidently I need to rethink some things

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/XjqCbkLmfG)  **June 6, 2025**

Hey everyone, I know a lot you have been worried about me and I just wanted to let all of you know that I’m safe. Shit has definitely hit the fan, but at the moment I’m safe. 

First, no I didn’t make that last edit. My boyfriend went on my phone while I was showering and trying to figure out what I wanted to say to him about everything and he found and edited my post. He then started yelling at me while I was still in the shower about sharing it online and calling him creepy. At the same time he was guilt tripping me and telling me that it was romantic and he did it because he loved me, he literally read a few of the comments out loud to me. He barely let me out of the shower but I did manage to get my clothes on while he was screaming at me. What really freaked me out was that he started listing off things that he could’ve done to me, I won’t list them here because it was extremely gruesome and I don’t think it’s allowed, but he said that he didn’t do those things because he’s such a nice guy. The way he described the things he could’ve done though made me feel like he had genuinely considered doing it. Also, I thought he was only watching me for a few months, apparently it was upwards of a year and it was genuine actual stalking. He had followed me home and to my college campus, he pulled out a collection of my lost hair ties that he kept.

I told him that he was scaring me and that we needed to take a break and come back to it later. At that he put a hole in the wall next to my head. I told him that I was leaving after that because fuck that shit and it was like a switch flipped and he started crying, he got on his knees and begged me to stay and apologized. I ended up accepting his apology because I didn’t feel safe leaving. Yesterday morning after he’d left for work I grabbed all my important documents and irreplaceable things before my clinicals started and kept them in my car. After my clinical I didn’t go back to the apartment. I’m not going to give much more detail than that because he does know my account obviously. 

And for Andrew if you’re reading this, which we both know you are, please just leave me alone. The person I thought I loved doesn’t actually exist and that’s heartbreaking. I no longer feel safe with you like I did before and I hate that. Please let’s just move on from each other.

For some background, I, 29F and my fiancé 30M have been together for 10 years. We had a baby back in 2020 and I lost my job around the same time. Our lease to our apartment was up and my grandma offered for us to move in with her so we did. We basically had our own little apartment rent free. I had thrown the idea of going to school out there and everyone agreed it was a good idea, my fiancé paid for it and my grandma watched my baby while I went to class. I graduate this semester (I did part time for a couple semesters). My fiancé has been making 90K a year for the past couple years and 70K when we first moved in. He’s saved a good amount of money.

We agreed to wait to get married until I finished school and we could buy a house together. We’ve been looking at houses more seriously for a past couple months and found one we both love. We started talking to a mortgage broker and that’s when he dropped the bomb on it being HIM and ONLY HIM on the mortgage and the deed. He said I wouldn’t have anything to do with it. I didn’t say anything in the meeting but afterwards I told him I thought WE were buying the house together and I’d pay half the mortgage. He said I would be paying half the mortgage but my name just wouldn’t be on it. So I told him that would mean I’d have no right to the house and he said he knew?!! He said since he saved the 40% down that it’s only fair that he has the rights to the house in case we end things.

I told him if that’s what he wants to do then I’m not paying for the mortgage. I said this isn’t a partnership and if he just wants his own place fine but I’m not paying for it. He called me a btch saying that he paid for everything for the past few years including my schooling. I told him I stayed home and watched our child so we didn’t have to pay for daycare and that ended up saving us money since I would’ve been only able to work part time. He said he didn’t care and I need to pay for half since I already agreed to it.

So reddit AITAH for refusing to pay the mortgage?

ETA: Originally we were supposed to move in with my grandma for a few months while we saved some money for renting a new place. I thought maybe it’d be a good idea to go to school so I’d make more money and we could potentially buy a place. My grandma said we should stay with her until I finish school so we can save up “for a life together”. My fiancé and I had AGREED that we would be buying a house together. He paid for the schooling because we were getting MARRIED and my student loans would’ve been OUR problem, not just mine. He encouraged me to finish my education so we could give our child a better quality of life.

Edit 2: For those of you saying him paying for my schooling would be more expensive than rent, my schooling in TOTAL costed $17,000. Across 5 years. That’s $3400 a year on average.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA If your name isn't on the deed, don't pay the mortgage. Honestly, I'd debate moving into a house that was just his and then getting married.

If he wants help with the mortgage, then he has to accept that you will also own the house.

>**OOP:** This was the original agreement. This is the first i’ve heard of me not being on the deed or mortgage

Commenter: NTA. He got free rent and free child care thanks to your family which allowed him to save that money. If your name isn’t on that house you shouldn’t put a dime into it.

>**OOP:** I’m honestly rethinking getting married atp. This feels so out of left field he’s literally never treated me this way before. I thought going to school and taking care of our son while not having to pay rent would’ve been an equal trade to him being able to save money honestly.

Commenter: Info Can you guys not sign a contract where he owns 70% of the equity and you 30%?

He puts down 40% the remainijg 60% is split between both of you and you both pay the mortgage?

He is an AH for how he spoke to you

>**OOP:** It’s not that i’m against doing something like this but it feels like he’s already thinking of screwing me in a divorce and we’re not even married.

*More on rent:*

>This!!! My schooling costed $3400 a year on average. We were paying about $2000 a month in rent. Rent has only gone up since then but just off paying for my school instead of rent he saved over 20k a year. Not to mention daycare costs in our area. We were looking at $2000 a month full time for an infant and about $1600 as a toddler. If i worked and went to school at the same time the entirety of my income (I was only making about $2500 a month before i got let go) would’ve gone towards daycare and school. I would’ve broken even and we would’ve been no better off.

Commenter (downvoted): How do you have BSN and it only costs $17k. A Batchelors is $50k easy.

I'm sorry but I cannot take your story at a 100% face value.

>**OOP:** I had a scholarship and pell grant and went to community college that offered a bridge program from RN to BSN

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kioq6x/update_aitah_for_telling_my_fianc%C3%A9_i_wont_help/) **1: May 9, 2025** **(Next Day)**

So first thank you to everyone who commented, a lot of you had great insight and were very supportive. To those who weren’t I got to see a perspective of how my fiancé might be feeling so thank you for that too. (although some of you were extremely misogynistic)

To answer some questions, my grandma offered to give us a place to stay for a few months while i looked for a job and so we could save some money (this was the beginning of the lockdown and no one was sure what the job market would look like). I had brought up finishing my degree and my grandma offered to watch my baby while I was in class. My fiancé said he’d pay for it since we didn’t have to pay for rent or daycare. He called it an “investment in our future”. I got a pell grant and a scholarship so he ended up only having to pay, on average, $3400 a year for the schooling. If i wasn’t going to school, my grandma didn’t want us staying there long term. This was purely her trying to give us a leg up and help US in OUR future. She wouldn’t have done so if she knew what my fiancé was going to do, she’s said this.

For the update, I told my fiancé we needed to talk about this arrangement and I asked why he changed his mind all of the sudden. He said he worked hard for his money and didn’t want to lose everything if we got divorced. I said that was fair but he’s now putting ME in a position to lose everything if I have zero rights to the property. He said I didn’t save up the money so the house should be his and his alone until and unless I put down 40% also.

I asked if he’d consider a prenup that would give him the 40% he put down and we’d split 50/50 the rest of the equity. I said this would protect the lump sum he put down while also giving me equity Id be paying for. He said he’d have to think about it but he doesn’t like the idea of having to sell if we split. I said then he can get his own place that he can afford on his own if he doesn’t want me on the title that badly. (This one he could barely afford with just his income not sure if he’d even be approved for the mortgage on his own tbh)

I also mentioned that I wanted to do couples therapy before we get married. He said no. That we didn’t need therapy and I just needed to “listen to him”. That was the end of the conversation.

I don’t know who this person is. This is not the man I had a child with. The man i had a child with massaged me every night while I was pregnant, he listened attentively to every random thing I wanted to talk about, he treated me with the upmost respect, he was the only person I wanted with me while I gave birth. He used to say he could never hurt me or screw me over because it’d hurt our child. I love him so much. I don’t know what happened.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

*Access to OOP's Accounts:*

>We do have separate accounts thankfully. He’ll have zero access to my money once I start my job in a couple weeks.

*To a misogynistic comment but I liked OOP's response:*

>How about he was able to save over 100k JUST by not having to pay rent, childcare, or utilities for FIVE YEARS. He would’ve had to pay ALL that AND I’d be making less money had he not paid for my schooling and gotten a free place to stay with my grandma. Take your misogyny elsewhere

Commenter: (part of a very long [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kioq6x/comment/mrhp3bi/?context=3It)) it does sound like he's been red pilled and joined the manosphere at some point.

>**OOP:** Thank you. I’m going to see if I can find any evidence of him consuming manosphere content. I think you might be right.. There has been other signs now that I look back. I cannot and will not stay with someone who’s been red pilled. For the sake of my child.  
I think either way he’ll be able to buy a house but the one we were looking at was really nice, he wouldn’t get one that nice by himself. that’s for sure.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kizygd/update_2_aitah_for_telling_my_fianc%C3%A9_i_wont_help/) **2: May 9, 2025 (9 hours later)**

Thank you to everyone who commented on my last post. You’ve shown me i’m not alone in this and that other people have gone through the same. I also feel vindicated in my decision to not pay half the mortgage if i’m not on the deed, thank you.

Anyways, tonight he and I got to talking about the arrangement again. He said he didn’t want to do the prenup I mentioned in my last update. So I told him my final offer was couples therapy AND getting married before we buy a house. I told him we should get a rental temporarily until we figure everything out and come to an agreement. He outright refused, again. He said he didn’t want to “waste money” renting. He then said I’m not entitled to any of his money and he won’t buy a house after we marry because i’ll just “win it in a divorce”. I said fine we won’t get married. He asked if I was breaking up with him and I said I didn’t know, but I needed space.

He. Lost. It. Called me a btch and a gold digger and told me I “owe” him $30,000. (I don’t know where he got this number from) He said i’m “used up” and no one will ever want me again. He went on ranting, yelling at me, for about 3 minutes until my grandma came over to us and told him to leave.

He’s staying the night at a hotel and has called me repeatedly. He’s left a few angry voicemails. I feel so numb. My baby is confused and keeps asking why I’m upset and where their dad went. I hate this so much.

To everyone who mentioned he might’ve gotten in with the manosphere/ red pill content, you were right. I looked at who he’s subscribed to on youtube, sure enough I saw Joe Rogan, Fresh and Fit podcast, justpearlythings, and adin ross. Safe to say he’s fallen down the manosphere rabbit hole. I know the man i fell in love with is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it.

There were definitely signs I didn’t notice, he always said he was saving “his money”, and HE was buying a house. He also said, on more than one occasion, he was the “man of the house”. He got really big on being a “provider and protector”. I didn’t put it all together until now. His behavior change has been pretty recently, like the last 8-9 months.

That’s it. My life is a shit show. Writing it out has been somewhat therapeutic. Thank you all again for your support!

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Welp, based on that rant, I guess you're single again. Do not take him back. Consider it a bullet dodged on the marriage front, and keep all of those texts and voice mails for a protective order + the custody battle.

>**OOP:** You’ve guessed correctly. I cannot and will not get over this.

Top Commenter: Keep the voicemails and messages he sends. You may need them. Get ready to go to court to custody and child support. Do not be alone with this man.

Edit: Grandma is awesome. If he comes back and is yelling and acting up call the cops.

>**OOP:** Unfortunately I have a friend who went though something similar with her husband (although his problem was porn addiction), so I know the drill. She said to keep and document EVERYTHING. My grandma’s friends son is a family lawyer and we’re him going to call tomorrow.  
*\[Editor's note- because I know it will come up in the comments- yes, it can be common to know a friend of a friend lawyer. I personally am related to, am friends with, acquainted with or am at least friends on facebook with 8 different lawyers lol*

Commenter: Im sad for you but at the same time super happy you found all this about his true self before getting married and stuff now you can move on with your life hopefully he will be there for the kids but please leave this man and never take him back.

>**OOP:** I don’t plan to take him back. I can’t imagine showing my kid this example of “love”

*To a longer, downvoted ESH* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kizygd/comment/mrlk6r2/?context=3) *but with multiple questions:*

I’ve seen a few comments like this so Im going to address a few things.

1. Before I went to school we had discussions in length about what was going to happen with our relationship financially.
2. We had agreed that while he paid for school, my grandma would not charge us rent. If I hadn’t gone to school she wanted us to move out.
3. The money “he” saved was over 100k. That would’ve easily covered just rent if we were to have had our own place. “His” money was supposed to be money for our family.
4. I tried suggesting a compromise that some people came up with on my initial post. He didn’t like the suggestion because he didn’t want me to have ANY a ownership in the house I’d be paying for too. He didn’t want to pay for the mortgage by himself either.
5. The reason I didn’t work is because my grandma said she wouldn’t watch out child that much, as it stood with me going to class she watched him for max 3 hours a day during the week. So we would’ve had to pay for daycare to cover my work and school hours, this would’ve had to be full time combined, it would’ve costed the entirety of what I’d make to pay for school and daycare. WE (my ex and I) decided it’d be better for me and our child if I didn’t work and saved the daycare cost.
6. His ONLY contribution he did for the entirety of living with my grandma was my college, $3400 A YEAR, sometimes groceries (myself or my grandma had to cook for him still), and *occasionally* doing dishes and watching his child. I did 90% of the childcare and about 60% of the household chores (grandma did about 35%).
7. My schooling doesn’t ONLY benefit me, it’s benefits our child. And if we’re being 100% honest, it benefits him too because the more IM making the less he’ll have to pay in child support.

**\*\*\*\*\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l4z6lu/update_3_aitah_for_telling_my_fianc%C3%A9_i_wont_help/)**: June 6, 2025 (almost 1 month later)\*\*\*\*\***

I’ve had a lot of people reach out and ask for an update so here it is. A few days after my last update he texted me and asked if we could meet to talk. I agreed and left my kid with my grandma and met him at a coffee shop. He started with an apology and went on about how that wasn’t him and he’s a good guy he just drank too much and lost control.

He asked me if I wanted to get married still and I said no. He asked if he could move back in so we could “work on things” and I said no. He even offered to do couples therapy and I said I’d have to think about it. He got quiet and asked if I ever even loved him. I said I did but I can’t handle the whole woe is me thing he’s been doing. I said I would have never tried to screw him over in the case of a divorce and that if I didn’t love him I would’ve never had a kid with him. I said he needs to do individual therapy before i’d consider doing couples therapy with him.

He got angry and yelled that I needed therapy more than he did and he refused to do it without me. He got up and said he’s going to take me to court and fight for full custody and that I’d never “see a dime” from him. I’m assuming he meant child support.

Since then he tried dropping by unannounced to take our kid. My grandmas lawyer friend (technically her friends son) told me that since we don’t have a custody agreement in place it’s a free for all and he could legally take him across state lines. He said it can be much more difficult to get him back especially if we don’t know where he is. So I didn’t let him take our kid but said he’s welcome to come visit but he’s not leaving with him until we have a custody arrangement in place. That ended about as well as you could imagine.

My grandma told me I can stay as long as I need and I got my kid signed up for daycare. That’s all for now. I’m hoping we can find an arrangement without courts but we’ll see.

But amidst the flash of cameras and Dan's charming politician's smile, a cold knot tightened in my stomach. Late-night texts, a mysterious credit card charge from a boutique I'd never heard of, ""Jolie's""... then I heard it, Dan cooing ""Love you too, Maddie"" into the phone. The perfect facade cracked; my husband was having an affair.  
The betrayal was bad enough, but then she popped up - Maddie Bell, young, blonde, influencer - flaunting my husband online. Vacation photos, the same necklace from Jolie's, and always always right next to my husband. Then I caught wind of THEIR baby. My carefully constructed world started crumbling as I came to terms with the stark reality: He wasn't just cheating; he was building a whole new life with her.  
I baked him that cake for our anniversary, knowing I'd soon be but a memory. Then, the ultimate slap - he was going to take Maddie home to meet his parents. The next day, she was at my doorstep feigning sympathy while my world burned. I couldn't stay with all of this on my plate. Not even for Liam.  
So I plotted my escape, a theatrical end: a staged car accident with me declared the victim. What kind? The one he causes. Was this revenge or survival? I thought it was both. But what would my story have in store? I started by documenting the full account of his disgusting deed in a diary I knew he would stumble on post-""mortem.""  
  
  
**Chapter 1**

  
The scent of vanilla and toasted sugar hung thick in the air, a familiar hug.  
  
""Ellie's Sweet Sensations"" was ten years old today.  
  
My bakery. My dream.  
  
The local paper's photographer snapped another picture. Flash.  
  
Dan, my husband, had his arm around my waist, beaming.  
  
""She's a genius, isn't she?"" he said to Maria, the reporter from the New England Chronicle.  
  
Maria scribbled in her notepad. ""Indeed, Mr. Hayes. A town treasure.""  
  
I managed a smile. ""It's a team effort.""  
  
Liam, our son, sixteen now and all angles and artistic brooding, stood a little awkwardly by the tiered cake display, looking proud in his own quiet way.  
  
Publicly, we were the Hayes family. Perfect.  
  
Privately, a small, cold knot had been tightening in my stomach for weeks.  
  
It started with a late-night text on Dan's phone. A heart emoji. I'd told myself it was a constituent. Dan was a politician, after all. Charisma was his currency.  
  
Then, the credit card bill. A charge from ""Jolie's,"" a boutique I'd never heard of, for an amount that made my breath catch. A gift, he'd said, for a staffer's new baby.  
  
It felt…off.  
  
The party buzzed around me. Friends, loyal customers, Bren - my rock, my business partner, her eyes sharp and knowing as she watched me.  
  
Later that evening, after the last guest had left and the bakery was quiet, I found the final clue.  
  
Dan was on the phone in his study, his voice low, intimate.  
  
""...of course, baby. He's my priority, but... you know how it is.""  
  
A pause. Then a soft chuckle.  
  
""Love you too, Maddie.""  
  
Maddie. Not a staffer. Not a constituent.  
  
The floor felt like it had dropped away. The sweet scent of the bakery suddenly turned cloying, suffocating.  
  
The perfect facade had cracked, and the truth was a raw, gaping wound.  
  
The decision settled in my heart like a stone.  
  
I couldn't stay. I wouldn't.  
  
But just leaving wasn't enough. He needed to feel a fraction of what I felt.  
  
The next morning, I sat across from Bren at a small table in the back of the empty bakery, the scent of yesterday's celebration now a mockery.  
  
""He's having an affair, Bren.""  
  
Her face, usually so quick with a joke, hardened. ""That bastard.""  
  
""He has another family. Or at least, another woman he tells 'I love you' to.""  
  
I laid out my plan, my voice flat, devoid of the storm raging inside me.  
  
""I'm going to disappear. Stage my death.""  
  
Bren's coffee cup clattered against the saucer. ""Ellie, are you insane?""  
  
""Maybe,"" I admitted. ""But I can't just walk away. He has to pay. He has to live with it.""  
  
I told her about ""New Life Solutions,"" an agency I'd found in the deepest corners of the internet. They specialized in fresh starts. Untraceable.  
  
""I have money, Bren. Enough. My grandmother's inheritance. I want it to be convincing. An accident.""  
  
Bren stared at me, her expression shifting from shock to a dawning, horrified understanding.  
  
""What kind of accident, Ellie?""  
  
""The kind he causes,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""I want a mannequin, lifelike, in a car. I want him to hit it. I want him to think he killed me.""  
  
Bren just looked at me, speechless for once.  
  
My resolve was steel. This wasn't just escape. This was revenge.  
  
Flashes of him, of us.  
  
Ten years ago, our own wedding. A small, intimate affair in a Berkshires inn.  
  
I'd baked our cake, a three-tiered lemon raspberry masterpiece. Dan had watched me, his eyes full of an adoration that I'd believed was as real as the sugar flowers I'd crafted.  
  
His hand on my back as we danced.  
  
The way he used to look at me across a crowded room, a secret smile just for me.  
  
Liam's birth. Dan, holding our tiny son, tears in his eyes, whispering, ""My family. My perfect family.""  
  
Had it all been a lie? Every touch, every shared laugh, every whispered promise?  
  
The memories, once sources of warmth, now burned.  
  
They were fuel for the cold fire of my plan. The contrast between that imagined past and the raw present was a constant ache.  
  
He had built his political career on the image of a devoted family man.  
  
I would tear it down, brick by loving, fabricated brick.  
  
A notification pinged on my phone. Instagram.  
  
A suggested post.  
  
Maddie Bell.  
  
Young. Blonde. Perfect teeth, a dazzling smile.  
  
Her feed was a curated collection of beach vacations, trendy restaurants, and selfies that screamed ""look at me.""  
  
She was a social media influencer. Of course.  
  
In one photo, she wore a delicate gold necklace. A small, interlocking heart pendant.  
  
My stomach lurched. It was identical to the one on the Jolie's credit card statement.  
  
The one Dan had bought for ""a staffer's baby.""  
  
The rage was a physical thing, coiling in my gut.  
  
She was everything I wasn't anymore. Young, carefree, unburdened by years of shared history and unspoken disappointments.  
  
And she had my husband.  
  
She was the ""baby"" he was talking to on the phone.  
  
The crisis wasn't just a feeling anymore; it was a face, a name, a constant, taunting presence in my digital world.  
  
Our fifteenth wedding anniversary approached.  
  
A cruel joke.  
  
I found myself going through the motions, a ghost in my own life.  
  
I booked a table at ""The Gilded Spoon,"" the fanciest restaurant in town, the one we'd gone to for our first anniversary.  
  
I bought a new dress, a deep sapphire silk that Bren said made my eyes look electric.  
  
I even baked a small cake - his favorite, dark chocolate with a salted caramel buttercream. Not for the bakery, just for us. A pathetic offering to a dead marriage.  
  
The evening arrived. I dressed with care, a strange detachment settling over me.  
  
Liam was at a friend's house.  
  
The table was set. Candles flickered. The small cake sat under a glass dome.  
  
Seven o'clock. Our reservation time.  
  
Seven-thirty.  
  
Eight.  
  
My phone finally buzzed. A text from Dan.  
  
""So sorry, El. Got held up. Campaign crisis. Raincheck?""  
  
No call. No elaborate excuse. Just a casual dismissal.  
  
I stared at the flickering candles, the uneaten cake.  
  
The disappointment was a familiar ache, but this time it was sharper, edged with a bitter knowledge.  
  
He wasn't at a campaign meeting.  
  
He was with her. Maddie.  
  
The silence in the house was immense, broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, each tick a nail in the coffin of our marriage.  
  
The next morning, I started to pack.  
  
Not clothes. Not essentials.  
  
Memories.  
  
Liam's first pair of shoes, bronzed and heavy.  
  
The goofy stuffed giraffe Dan won for me at a county fair, its fur worn thin from years of Liam dragging it around.  
  
My grandmother's locket, the one she gave me on my wedding day.  
  
Photographs. So many photographs. Us smiling. Always smiling.  
  
I packed them into sturdy cardboard boxes.  
  
Each item was a stab of pain, a reminder of what I was losing, what had been stolen.  
  
But with each box sealed, a sense of grim satisfaction grew.  
  
This wasn't just an act of clearing out; it was an act of severance.  
  
I addressed the largest box to ""Maddie Bell,"" her address easily found online.  
  
Inside, nestled amongst Liam's childhood treasures, I placed a simple, unsigned card: ""Heirlooms for the new family.""  
  
Let her see what she was helping to destroy. Let her understand the depth of the life she was invading.  
  
My resolve hardened. There was no turning back. I was erasing myself from their narrative, one packed memory at a time.  
  
I was taping up the last box when I heard the front door open.  
  
""Mom? We're home!"" Liam's voice, still boyish despite his height.  
  
Followed by Dan's deeper, more practiced tones. ""Ellie? You here, honey?""  
  
My heart hammered. They weren't supposed to be back for hours.  
  
I quickly pushed the boxes into the back of the hall closet, my hands trembling slightly.  
  
Dan appeared in the doorway of the living room, where I was standing amidst a feigned attempt at tidying.  
  
He was smiling, that charming politician's smile that could win over any crowd.  
  
""Hey. Sorry about last night. Things got crazy.""  
  
Liam came up behind him, looking tired but happy. ""The concert was awesome, Mom. You should've come.""  
  
""Dan took me and Maddie,"" Liam said, oblivious. ""She knows the band.""  
  
The name, ""Maddie,"" hung in the air between us, casual, innocent from Liam's lips.  
  
To me, it was a detonation.  
  
Dan's smile didn't waver, but a flicker of something - annoyance? - crossed his eyes.  
  
""Maddie Bell. She's a... a friend. Helping with youth outreach for the campaign.""  
  
A lie. So smooth. So practiced.  
  
My plan, which had felt so clear, so righteous, suddenly felt precarious. They were here. In my space. Breathing my air.  
  
I needed them gone.  
  
I pasted on a smile. ""Sounds like fun. I was just... decluttering.""  
  
Dan stepped further into the room, his eyes scanning, perhaps noticing the faint scent of cardboard.  
  
He held out a small, gift-wrapped box.  
  
""A\_little something for our anniversary. Since I messed up dinner.""  
  
His voice was all contrition, oozing sincerity.  
  
I took the box. It felt light, insignificant.  
  
Inside, a silver bracelet. Delicate. Pretty.  
  
And utterly meaningless.  
  
It felt like a prop, another piece of the facade he so carefully maintained.  
  
""It's beautiful, Dan. Thank you."" My voice sounded hollow even to my own ears.  
  
He leaned in to kiss me. I turned my head slightly, so his lips brushed my cheek. His scent, once a comfort, now repelled me.  
  
He pulled back, a slight frown creasing his brow. ""Everything okay, El?""  
  
""Just tired,"" I said. ""Long day.""  
  
The lie came easily. I was learning from the master.  
  
Liam, bless his innocent heart, piped up, ""Maddie said she's a huge fan of your cakes, Mom. She wants to come by the bakery sometime.""  
  
My eyes met Dan's over Liam's head. His expression was suddenly tight.  
  
The cold knot in my stomach turned to ice.  
  
He was bringing her into my world, into my son's life, without a shred of shame.  
  
The bracelet felt heavy on my wrist, a shackle.  
  
I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the gift in his face.  
  
Instead, I smiled again, a rictus of forced pleasantry. ""That's... nice.""  
  
The final, definitive blow didn't come from Dan. It came from Liam.  
  
Later that evening, as I was helping him with a history assignment, he was scrolling through photos on his phone from the concert.  
  
""Look, Mom, this is Maddie.""  
  
He turned the screen towards me.  
  
There she was. Maddie Bell. Arm in arm with Dan. Both of them laughing, heads thrown back, looking entirely too comfortable, too intimate.  
  
Dan's hand was on her waist, a casual possessiveness that made my blood run cold.  
  
It wasn't a ""networking event."" It wasn't ""youth outreach.""  
  
It was a date. My husband, on a date with his mistress, with our son as an unwitting chaperone.  
  
""She's really cool, Mom,"" Liam continued, oblivious to the way the world had just tilted on its axis for me. ""She said you and Dad are like, total couple goals.""  
  
Couple goals. The irony was a bitter pill.  
  
Any lingering doubt, any tiny, desperate hope that I had misunderstood, that it was all some horrible mistake, evaporated.  
  
Shattered.  
  
The pain was so intense, it was almost a relief. There was no more ambiguity, no more hoping. Just the stark, ugly truth.  
  
My carefully constructed composure crumbled, just for a second, before I pulled it back together.  
  
""She sounds… friendly,"" I managed, my voice a strained whisper.  
  
The next day, a new follow request on my bakery's Instagram page.  
  
Maddie\_Bell.  
  
Then a DM.  
  
A picture. Her, wearing the interlocking heart necklace. The caption: ""Feeling loved. ✨""  
  
Followed by a message: ""Ellie! Liam told me so much about your amazing bakery. I'm your husband's… colleague. Dan talks about you all the time. He says you're an incredible woman. Would love to connect! Maybe grab coffee? 😊""  
  
The audacity. The sheer, unadulterated gall.  
  
She wasn't just having an affair with my husband. She was actively taunting me.  
  
The smiling emoji felt like a punch to the gut.  
  
This wasn't an accidental slip. This was a power play.  
  
She wanted me to know. She wanted me to see her, to acknowledge her presence in his life, in our life.  
  
My fingers hovered over the block button.  
  
No. Not yet.  
  
Let her think she was winning.  
  
The anger was a clean, cold fury now. It sharpened my focus, solidified my resolve.  
  
My plan for the ""accident"" suddenly felt more necessary, more justified than ever.  
  
She wanted to connect? Oh, we would connect. In a way she could never imagine.  
  
A week later, Dan announced he had to go to Boston for an overnight ""campaign strategy session.""  
  
""Big donors,"" he said, looking important. ""Crucial for the next phase.""  
  
He packed an overnight bag, kissed me goodbye with that practiced, empty affection.  
  
I knew where he was going.  
  
Not to a strategy session.  
  
He was going to Maddie.  
  
The ease with which he lied, the casual way he tossed off these betrayals, was astounding.  
  
Did he think I was a fool? Or did he simply not care anymore?  
  
Perhaps both.  
  
The house felt empty after he left, but not in a peaceful way. It was filled with the ghosts of his deceptions.  
  
I wandered from room to room, touching things, trying to reconcile the life I thought I had with the one that was now reality.  
  
The love I'd felt for him, so carefully nurtured over fifteen years, was curdling into something dark and unrecognizable.  
  
Despair was a cold companion, but the thought of my plan offered a sliver of dark comfort.  
  
He would pay. He would feel this.  
  
Liam came home from school, dropped his backpack by the door.  
  
""Dad gone again?""  
  
""Boston,"" I said. ""Campaign stuff.""  
  
He nodded, accepting it without question. Why would he question it? His father was a rising political star. Busy. Important.  
  
Later, he was on a video call in his room. I heard snippets of laughter.  
  
His door was ajar. I glanced in.  
  
He was talking to Maddie.  
  
She was on his screen, animated, smiling. He was laughing, genuinely laughing.  
  
Something twisted inside me.  
  
She wasn't just content with my husband. She was charming my son.  
  
Weaving herself into the fabric of our family, thread by insidious thread.  
  
My son. The one precious, unblemished thing in my life.  
  
And Dan was letting it happen. Encouraging it, even.  
  
The pain was a fresh wave, sharp and debilitating. This was a betrayal on a whole new level.  
  
It wasn't just about Dan and me anymore. It was about Liam.  
  
He was being drawn into this web of deceit, and he didn't even know it.  
  
The thought of Liam unknowingly bonding with this woman, the woman who was destroying his family, was unbearable. It fueled my resolve like nothing else. This had to end. And it had to end dramatically.  
  
The ""New Life Solutions"" office was in a nondescript building in a warehouse district an hour out of town.  
  
The woman who met me, Sharon ""Shae"" Davis, was an artful study in controlled chaos. Quirky glasses, a dozen silver rings on her fingers, but her eyes were sharp, assessing.  
  
""Mrs. Hayes,"" she said, her voice calm. ""Please, come in.""  
  
The office was minimalist, functional. No personal touches. Anonymous.  
  
We sat across a plain metal desk.  
  
""You've read our terms,"" Shae stated, not asked.  
  
""I have.""  
  
""And the payment?""  
  
""It's in an account, ready for transfer upon confirmation of… services rendered.""  
  
Shae nodded. ""We pride ourselves on discretion and efficacy. You want a disappearance. An accident.""  
  
""Yes,"" I said. ""A car accident. Untraceable. I walk away. A new identity. Everything we discussed.""  
  
""It's a standard package. Expensive, but clean.""  
  
""There's more,"" I said, my voice steady. ""A specific request.""  
  
Shae raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable.  
  
""I want a mannequin. Lifelike. My height, my build, my hair color. Dressed in my clothes. In the driver's seat of a car. A car that my husband… that Daniel Hayes… will hit.""  
  
Silence. Shae tapped a pen against her desk.  
  
""That's… highly unusual, Mrs. Hayes. And significantly more complex. It borders on entrapment, with severe legal ramifications for him, and potentially for us if mismanaged.""  
  
""I understand the risks,"" I said. ""And I'm prepared to compensate you accordingly for the additional complexity and… moral flexibility required."" I named a figure that made her pen stop tapping.  
  
""He needs to believe he killed me,"" I continued, the words cold, precise. ""He needs to live with that guilt. Every single day for the rest of his life. It's the only way he'll truly understand.""  
  
Shae studied me for a long moment. I met her gaze, unwavering.  
  
""Your determination is… compelling, Mrs. Hayes. As is your financial commitment."" She gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. ""We can discuss the logistics. The timing will be critical. The setup, flawless.""  
  
""I want it to happen on the night of his next big fundraiser,"" I said. ""He'll be distracted, rushing. It needs to be believable.""  
  
Shae smiled then, a thin, sharp smile. ""Believability is our specialty.""  
  
Was Dan ever truly mine?  
  
As I drove home from Shae's office, the question echoed in my mind.  
  
All those years. The loving glances, the tender touches, the whispered endearments.  
  
Had they all been part of the act?  
  
Was I just a pawn in his game, a necessary component of the ""perfect family"" image he needed to project for his political ambitions?  
  
The thought that my entire marriage, the foundation of my adult life, might have been a carefully constructed illusion was devastating.  
  
The woman who had been ""celebrated,"" ""adored,"" ""cherished"" - was she just a fool?  
  
Had I been blind, or had he been that good an actor?  
  
The pain of his betrayal was one thing. The pain of my own potential stupidity, my own naivety, was another, sharper sting.  
  
All those expensive gifts, the grand gestures - were they guilt offerings? Or investments in his image?  
  
The beautiful house, the successful bakery, the charming politician husband. It was a picture-perfect life.  
  
A beautifully crafted lie.  
  
And I, the celebrated pastry chef, had been the sweetest, most gullible ingredient.  
  
The anger returned, cold and righteous.  
  
He wouldn't just live  
  
with guilt. He would live with the ruins of the life he had torched.  
  
And I would be free.  
  
I found Maddie's phone number. It wasn't hard. Social media influencers weren't known for their privacy.  
  
I called her.  
  
""Hello?"" Her voice was bright, a little breathless.  
  
""Maddie, this is Ellie Hayes.""  
  
A beat of silence. Then, a nervous giggle. ""Oh! Hi, Ellie! So nice to finally, um, hear from you.""  
  
""I know about you and Dan,"" I said, my voice flat, devoid of emotion.  
  
Another silence, longer this time.  
  
""I… I don't know what you're talking about,"" she finally stammered, her voice losing its confident edge.  
  
""Save it,"" I said. ""I'm not interested in denials or excuses. I'm interested in a proposition.""  
  
""A proposition?""  
  
""Dan's birthday is in three weeks,"" I stated. ""Let's make it a deadline. Winner takes all. By his birthday, one of us will have him, and the other will be out of the picture. Permanently.""  
  
""Are you… threatening me?"" Maddie's voice was a squeak.  
  
""Interpret it however you like,"" I said. ""Just know that I don't play to lose. And I'm tired of sharing.""  
  
I could almost hear her mind racing. She was young, ambitious. She probably saw this as a challenge, a dramatic twist in her own self-made soap opera.  
  
""Okay,"" she said, a new determination in her voice. ""Game on, Ellie.""  
  
I smiled. A cold, predatory smile.  
  
She had no idea what game she was playing. Or what the stakes truly were.  
The fundraiser was the night before Dan's birthday. Perfect.

1la6aay,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1la6aay/daddys_girl_she_was_taller_and_slimmer_than_i_was/,"Daddy's Girl :  She was taller and slimmer than I was but my breasts were bigger and my hair finer. It fell in a similar braid to my mother’s down my back, almost the same shade of brown.“Mom, we’re going to be late,” Alice shouted from the car, her head shoved through, her bushy, tawny hair........","Daddy's Girl “You take care of your father and be a good girl, Melody,” my mother said as she stood in the doorway of our house, her the tight, gold necklace glinting about her throat. She always wore it. The thin chain kept the heart-shaped locket pressed to the hollow of her throat. Her braid of brown hair fell off her right shoulder and down the front of her conservative dress. My mom always wore the most conservative dress. She was such a fifties housewife, staying at home, keeping everything clean, being subservient to dad. Like always subservient. She would fetch him beers when he watched TV after work and always made sure his coffee was topped off during breakfast. Every day when he came home from work, Mom would be waiting for him, ready to take his jacket and massage his feet.And she did it with a smile on her face. She loved my dad. And I didn’t blame him. He was a handsome man, tall, dark-haired, and muscular. Sometimes he made my body ache with desires and I would have to masturbate in my room hoping my twin sister Alice didn’t notice.Now Alice and I weren’t identical twins but fraternal. We looked as much alike as any other normal set of sisters. She was taller and slimmer than I was but my breasts were bigger and my hair finer. It fell in a similar braid to my mother’s down my back, almost the same shade of brown.“Mom, we’re going to be late,” Alice shouted from the car, her head shoved through, her bushy, tawny hair spilling about her delicate face. We both inherited Mom’s small nose and delicate cheekbones, making us look fragile and innocent. In a moment, dear,” my mom shouted, always full of patience. She turned to me and stroked my hair. “While I’m gone it will be up to you to take care of him, okay. Be obedient and a good girl. I know you will be. You love being a good girl for your daddy.”My cheeks warmed. Ever since I realized that my dad was a muscular hunk beneath the dress shirts he wore for his office job, I found myself wanting to do whatever he said, running errands, fetching him drinks, doing things Mom normally did for him so I could be around him. It made my heart almost float out of my chest when I did.I just wanted to be close to my dad. I was a daddy’s girl, but so were lots of my friends. My friends, including my best friend Sun, were all jealous that I had the cutest dad.Alice, on the other hand, was a brat. I was glad she was going with Mom to Grandma’s. Three weeks of just me and Dad while Mom helped Grandma adjust after Grandpa’s hip surgery. I could have gone, but it was my choice to stay.And I would get to spend so much time with Daddy. So of course I declined. It was so boring at Grandma’s. I loved her and Grandpa, I did, but there was nothing to do there but be board. They barely had internet and no cable, just rabbit ears on a black and white TV.“I’ll be good for Dad,” I smiled.She sighed. “You don’t call him Daddy anymore. I get it, you’re getting older, but it always made him happy when you call him Daddy.”“It does?” I asked, a hot thrill shooting through me. Daddy. It felt so naughty to call him that at my age. I squirmed my hips, my nipples hardening in my bra.She nodded her head. “Now you be good. Do everything he tells you. Eighteen is not too old to be spanked over your father’s knee.”I blushed. Once, I had seen Dad spanking Mom a few weeks ago. They were in their bedroom, but the door had been cracked. It was Saturday and my sister and I were supposed to be weeding the garden. I slipped in to change my clothes—my tight shorts were proving impractical to moving—and heard the slaps. At first, I thought dad was hurting her until I glimpsed her face.Mom loved to be spanked.The image rose in my mind. My mother naked, her large breasts pressing against Dad’s muscular thigh, her round bottom red and wiggling as he slammed his broad hand on her flesh. Her head had risen with each spanking, her toes curling. I caught a glimpse between her legs. She was shaved and looked so youthful. And with her hair braided, she seemed more like a little girl being spanked by her daddy than a wife playing with her husband.I had only watched for a minute before I was so afraid I ran. I burst into my bedroom, shoved my hands down my shorts, and rubbed at my pussy lips. I was so wet. I had never masturbated with such a frenetic need as I pictured Dad’s muscular chest, covered in barbwire tattoos, rippling as he drew back his arm and spanked me.“Melody,” my mother said, bringing me out of my fantasy. “You are going to behave, right?”“I’ll be Daddy’s good girl,” I smiled.“Good.” Dad’s voice rumbled behind me.Startled, I let out a squeak and turned around, my hands clasped before me as Dad, wearing a plain, white t-shirt that molded to his muscles, walked up. Mom lowered her head and clasped her hands before her. Dad stopped before her, ignoring me, and raised her chin.“Dear,” Mom said, “Melody has promised to take care of you while I am gone. I hope she will be a satisfactory replacement.”“Once I have her trained,” Dad answered, his thumb brushing her cheeks.“Good.” A smile played on Mom’s lips. “Then, with your permission, dear, I would like to go and visit my parents.”“Granted.”Permission? Why did Mom need permission?Dad seized Mom’s lips in a kiss. My eyes widened at the unbridled passion. Mom shuddered, her eyes closed while Dad owned her lips. He still held her chin as he kissed her. She moaned, her hips shuddering, her hands squeezed tight together. And then he broke it. Mom took a deep breath, her cheeks flushed.

  
Daddy's Girl   I love you, dear.”Dad nodded, his thumb still caressing her cheek, an intimate touch. Wild thoughts of Dad touching me like that spilled through my mind. A heat ignited between my thighs, wet, molten passion. The urge to run upstairs and masturbate seized me as Dad patted Mom’s ass as she walked away, a laugh on her lips and a saucy look in her eyes.They were so affectionate.“Well,” Dad said, staring down at me. He cupped my chin and lifted my eyes. Would he kiss me now? “It is just me and you. Your Mother promises me you will behave.”“Of course ... Daddy.”His lips twitched, a smile almost forming. “Good.” He kissed me on my forehead instead of my lips. My flesh burned where he touched me. I shuddered. “Go fetch me a beer, the game’s about to start.”“Yes, Daddy.” My heart beat in my chest as I turned and raced to the kitchen.I thought I felt Dad’s eyes on my ass. I wore an old pair of jeans—I was supposed to go school shopping with Mom and Alice tomorrow—and they were tight. They hugged my rear and legs. I had grown since I bought them.I hoped he was watching. It made me feel so womanly. Mom was gone. It was my place to be the woman of the house and make sure the man was taken care of.My teachers at school would be horrified. Especially Ms. Gardner and Mrs. Thompson. They were always talking about how women didn’t have to serve men and being a housewife was “internalized misogyny.” But it was nice to serve. It made me happy.What was so wrong with that?Nothing.Of course, I never contradicted my teachers. And I never told them about my mother. She was almost straight out of the ancient TV show that sometimes appeared on Nickelodeon late at night—Leave it to Beaver. But she wasn’t faking her happiness. She was always humming and singing as she cooked or clean.“Your father earns the money and provides for us,” she would say, “and he works hard to do it. So I work just as hard at home making our life pleasant. Your father appreciates what I do, and I appreciate what he does. We compliment each other.”Hearing her say it made it sound like the most romantic thing in the world.My head buzzed with images of me being Daddy’s wife. Cooking and cleaning, waiting for him to come home, then I would massage his feet after his hard day while we talked. They always laughed when Mom massaged his feet. It was their private time. Alice and I were banished to our bedrooms or elsewhere during it.I brought the beer to Daddy.“Thank you, Melody,” he said, taking it and giving me a nod.“You’re welcome, Daddy,” I smiled.He patted the arm of his recliner while the announcer called the baseball game. The Mariners were playing the A’s, and the first pitch had just been thrown. I sat on the chair’s arm and leaned back, Daddy’s arm going around my waist.It was wonderful. I smiled, loving being near him even if it meant watching a boring baseball game. Twice more he sent me to get him another beer. I returned with his drink and diet cokes for myself. I even started getting into the game, and when the Mariners won, Daddy hugged me to his chest.He smelled so manly. The hot itch returned to me. I squirmed, my cheeks burning, suddenly so embarrassed. “I have to go make dinner, Daddy.”“Okay, sweetheart.” He kissed me on the forehead.I crawled off the recliner, my thighs squeezed tight. I really did have to start dinner, but I wanted to masturbate so badly. “Daddy, Mom was supposed to take me clothing shopping tomorrow.”“I’ll take you.” his eyes fell on mine. So strong. “But you won’t buy anything without my approval.”Part of me wanted to revolt. What did my dad know about clothes? He would probably try to dress me like Mom. Long skirts, loose blouses, nothing to show off my growing body. I liked to dress in tight jeans, short shorts, and daring skirts. But I had promised to be a good girl for Daddy.“Okay, Daddy.”“Good girl,” he smiled. My heart thudded for joy.

Daddy’s GirlI was so tired the next morning. I couldn’t sleep last night. Thoughts of taking over all of Mom’s duties for Daddy filled my thoughts. I had rubbed my poor pussy raw masturbating last night. But I couldn’t stop. The idea gripped me. Massaging his feet, stripping him naked, laying beneath him as he pumped his cock in and out of me.I knew about sex. Several of my friends had had sex, and they told me all about how disappointing the boys were the first times. “I wish I had a man do it,” they all said. “Someone older and sexier. Like your Dad, Melody.”“I would totally let your dad pop my cherry,” Sun had giggled.“Older men know how to get the job done,” Tiffany had proclaimed. “Trust me.”“Every girl knows it,” agreed Donna. “But good luck finding an older man that isn’t a perv. He needs to be perfect. I bet your Dad would be perfect. Maybe I should spend the night.”I had said no. There was no way I was letting Donna near my dad, not with the hungry look in her eye.Now my thoughts were consumed with him. We were all alone. Three times I stood up and walked to my bedroom door, set on walking down the hall and slipping into bed with Daddy. But it was also so scary. I wanted him so badly, but incest was wrong. He wouldn’t want to sleep with me and cheat on Mom.He was a good man not a pervert.The third time I had stood at my door, gripping the nub, my stomach twisting. I listened. The house was so quiet. I strained to hear him in his bedroom. I imagined him awake, burning with desires for me, waiting for me to come and perform Mom’s wifely duties with him.But I chickened out and ran back to my bed. And then masturbated to another orgasm.I almost overslept and forgot to make Daddy breakfast. But I remembered at the last minute and rushed downstairs wearing only my thin nightgown. I whipped up Sunday breakfast and had it ready when Daddy came down at his usual 8 AM.It was after breakfast he took me to the mall. I held his arm as we walked through the mall. I noticed the other girls and women who looked at them and a prideful surge went through him. He was desired but he was mine.Until Mom got back.I led Daddy to the first store, pulling him past the shoplifting detectors and into the vibrant clothing store. Everywhere I looked were frilly, feminine items. Daddy was the opposite of it all, standing tall, muscular, hunky.“I only want you to buy skirts,” Daddy said. “I like my girls in skirts.”“Is that why Mom never wears jeans or pants?”Daddy nodded. “And you’re at that age where you should do the same.”“But long skirts, like Mom? Hers are so boring.”A smile crossed his lips. “Sweetheart, buy the shortest, tightest skirts you want. You have gorgeous legs. Let Daddy see them.”Heat rushed up my legs. “Yes, Daddy,” I squeaked then turned away, my cheeks on fire. Daddy wanted to see my legs. I wish I was wearing a skirt right now instead of stupid shorts.There were so many wonderful skirts. Short tennis skirts, pleated skirts, pencil skirts, flowery skirts, knee-length skirts, mid-thigh skirts, even shorter ones. I felt so daring when I grabbed on of those, imagining it only falling past my rear and not much else. It would show off so much of my legs. Daddy didn’t complain as I handed him another skirt to hold. He threw them over his muscular arms, a patient smile on his lips as he glanced at what I bought.I liked flashy skirts with bright colors, drawing the eye.And then I had to find blouses to go with them. We headed across the store where I snagged halter tops, peasant blouses, V-necks, scoop necks, baby doll t-shirts, belly shirts. With each one I considered which bottom it would go with, making my outfit plans. This top could go with three different skirts, bu this one only went with one. I took the top that could match three skirts.Variety. I needed to mix up my clothing. I couldn’t wear the same outfit combinations all the time.With a dozen blouses and skirts chosen, I headed into the back for the changing rooms. “I can’t wait to see how pretty you look,” Daddy said as I closed the door.My cheeks blushed. I looked out the louvered slats. I could sort of see through them from my side, glimpsing his legs in his blue jeans while I pulled off the t-shirt I wore. A sudden surge of excitement went through me as I wiggled out of my shorts.I was almost naked in here and Daddy was just on the other side.I grabbed a knee-length skirt and a halter top that went well with it, adjusting my bra. I would have to get a strapless bra to wear with the halter top, my straps were too obvious. I stared at myself in the mirror, turning, loving how my braid of dark-brown hair fell down my back, almost reaching the soft swell of my rear. The skirt fell lovely across my butt. I shifted my hips, loving how the hem swayed about my legs.“You dressed yet?”“Coming, Daddy,” I giggled. “You need to be patient when girls are trying on clothing.”“I’m not good at patience. I like to take what I want.”A hot wave rushed through me. I almost said, “You can take me, Daddy,” but that would be absolutely stupid.I stepped out, standing before him, suddenly so afraid. What if he hated it. His arms folded before him, his eyes studying me as I fidgeted. I played with my fingers before him, wishing he would say something.“Straighten your back,” he said. “And turn around. Let me get a good look at you.

  
Daddy's Girl“Yes, Daddy,” I said, my spine snapping straight. Then I turned, putting a little sway into my hips to really make the skirt swirl. “Do you ... like it, Daddy?”“The skirt’s a little long,” he said, “but your top is great. We’ll need to get you a strapless bra. Unless you already own one?”“I don’t, Daddy.”“We’ll fix that.”I swallowed then reached for the door and opened it. I slipped in. Only the door didn’t close behind me right away. I turned and gasped as Daddy stood in there with me, his arms folded, his eyes on me as I clutched the next top.“Well, this will be faster,” he nodded, his eyes rolling up and down my body. “You won’t have to keep coming and going.”“I ... I don’t think it’s allowed for you to be in here, Daddy,” I trembled.“I don’t care.” His eyes were so dark and commanding. “Now change. Show me your next lovely outfit.”“Yes, Daddy.”I hastened to obey him. I pulled off the halter top. I felt so naked in just my bra, cupping my round breasts. My nipples were so hard, poking at the front. I don’t know why. I had worn my bikini around Daddy before and it showed just as much flesh. I wiggled out of my skirt, bending over to step out of it and pointing my panty-clad rear at Daddy.“Cute pair,” he said. “Black. I like them.”“Black? What...” My panties. My cheeks burned even more and the hot itch between my thighs swelled. “Thank you, Daddy.”“You’re growing up so fast.”I straightened and pulled on a red, V necked blouse and turned to face him.His cock bulged the front of his jeans. I froze, half-pulling on the top, my right arm through the sleeve, my left arm searching for the armhole. I sucked in a deep breath. Daddy was turned on right now.I turned him on.“Keep changing,” he ordered. “Don’t stop. I need to approve all your outfits.”“D-do you approve all of Mom’s?”“Why do you think I take her shopping? Your mother dresses to please me. She’s a good girl. And I know you want to be just like her, another good girl for Daddy.”“I do,” I whispered. I pulled the top over my head and pulled my braid out the back. Then I grabbed a jean skirt I thought would be quite cute with this top. I stepped into the skirt, pulling it up my hips. It was tight. I sucked in a breath to get it up over me and then zipped up the side. It fell to my mid-thigh, a few artfully worn through spots showing off my pale thighs beneath.Daddy nodded his head as I turned. “Now bend over,” he ordered. “Touch your toes.”“Yes, Daddy.”I knew I had to do it with my ass facing him. I bent over, the skirt sliding up my thighs, revealing more and more of my flesh. I almost wished it was short enough to flash my panties at Daddy. The hot itch between my legs grew even hotter. I had to be wet, my panties soaking up my excitement.I wanted to escape to a bathroom and masturbate.“D-do you like them?” A tremble ran through me.“They are perfect. You have great taste in clothing.” His hand stroked my bare thigh right beneath the hem of my skirt. I shuddered and moaned, the blood rushing to my head as I stayed bent over. What was he doing. “Just perfect. Okay, try on the next.”My virgin body trembled as I turned. I could still feel his hand on my thigh even though he stopped touching me. It was the most intimate contact I had ever had with another person. I didn’t date much—Daddy didn’t approve and, unlike Alice, I was a good girl. I had barely kissed a boy let alone let one really touch [me.It](http://me.It) was amazing to feel his hand on me. As I stripped down to my underwear, I wanted Daddy to touch me again.I grabbed the one very short skirt I selected. I had never worn a miniskirt before. It was made of a stretchy, black material that hugged my ass when I pulled it on. It felt so exposed. It ended right below my butt-cheek. As I pulled on a purple belly skirt with dangling, golden fringes around the hem, I felt like at any moment the skirt would slide up my flesh and expose my panties.“Now that is a skirt,” Daddy said, as I faced him, the tasseled fringes caressing my belly and back as they swayed. “Yes, it is. Turn around. Let me see your ass.”“Yes, Daddy.”I turned, so aware that I was turning him on. He groaned. His hands reached out, touching me. It was so wrong. No father should touch his daughter like that, especially not when she was underage, but I didn’t care. It was so wonderful. His hands so strong as they squeezed me.“That’s my good girl,” he whispered as his hands kneaded me. “Mmm, you’re making Daddy so happy. Now bend over. Let’s see how this skirt moves.”“Yes, Daddy.”My pussy clenched as I bent over. He let go of my ass as I did. I gasped when I pressed back into his cock bulging his jeans. I felt it along the top of my ass as I bent over, my braid falling to the floor. I fought the urge to grind back against him. My pussy was so itchy. I wanted to be touched.Needed to be touched.I didn’t care if it was my Daddy doing the touching.That would just make it hotter.“What a gorgeous skirt,” he groaned, gripping my hips. He moved, sliding his bulge up and down against my ass, moving it lower. It pressed against my pussy. I felt him through all our clothing. So big. So thick. Was he bigger than a normal guy? What would he feel like in me?Incestuous passions gripped me. I wanted my father to fuck me right here, right now.“Melody, kneel,” he ordered, grinding harder against me.”“Kneel?”His hand smacked on my ass. I yelped as the burning pain shot through me. I didn’t understand why that made my pussy even warmer. “I gave you an order. What happens when girls are bad.”“We’re spanked, Daddy.”He rubbed my ass where his hand landed. “Well?”I spun around and knelt before him, the thin carpet of the changing room rough on my knees. I stared up at him. He seemed even taller than usual. The changing room’s light shone above his head, making him a dark shadow.“You’ve made me hard,” he continued. “You’ve excited me. Good girls take care of the problems they create.”I stared at his cock, my eyes widening. “I ... What are you wanting me to do, Daddy?” This couldn’t be happening. This really couldn’t. We were in the changing room. I know I was horny and wanted my Daddy, but they were just fantasies.Incestuous, forbidden fantasies.

Daddy’s Girl“I am telling you to pull out my cock and suck it until I cum. You will swallow every drop. If you don’t, I will spank you so hard when we get home.” His hand reached out and seized my braid. “You promised to be a good girl, Melody.”“I did, Daddy.” I licked my lips, staring at his bulge. “But ... but ... what about Mom?”“What about her? She’s not here. You are. What will it be, young lady?”Another wave of heat washed through me. “I’ll be good, Daddy.”My hands trembled as they reached for the zipper of his jeans. I had never sucked a cock before. I had only heard my friends whispering and giggling about it. I needed to watch my teeth, use my tongue. Lick it and suck it.The zipper rasped as I pulled it down. His cock pressed at the open fly, tenting a pair of dark-blue boxers. My breath quickened as I reached up and hooked my fingers in the waistband. I froze. I couldn’t believe this was happening.Daddy seized my braid. “Do you want a spanking, young lady?”His stern voice compelled me. I would be a good girl for Daddy. I hauled them down. His dick popped out, bouncing before me. A flick of something wet splattered my cheek. It was warm. More juices leaked out of the tip of his cock.“Lick the precum up then suck,” he growled, still holding on to my braid.I leaned forward and licked.Daddy groaned as my tongue slid across his warm, spongy tip. Then I reached the drop of clear fluid—his precum. It didn’t have much flavor, a little salty. Not bad at all. An erotic thrill went through me as I licked again. And again.I was blowing my Daddy’s cock.My lips opened wider. I sucked the tip into my mouth. My tongue explored it as I remembered my friend’s words. I sucked, my lips forming a tight seal, my cheeks pulling inward. Daddy groaned again, louder.I pleased him. I made him hard and I would be a good girl and take care of his erection. Mommy wasn’t here to do it.My hands seized his cock. He felt so huge in my grip. I stroked my fists up and down his shaft, brushing my lips. His dick throbbed with his heart beat, pulsing with his passion. I stared up at Daddy and his shadowed face.“That’s it,” he panted. “Melody, you’re being such a good girl for Daddy.”I sucked harder. I fisted him faster. My tongue swirled circles about the tip as more and more of his precum filled my mouth. My head bobbed. I took more of his cock into my mouth. Daddy loved it. His hand pulled on my braid, encouraging me.My hips shifted. My pussy was so wet. I bet there was a big wet spot. When I masturbated tonight, I would relive this over and over, remembering every taste and smell. When I breathed in, I smelled his musk. It was intense, rising out of his thick, dark curls.“Such a good girl,” he groaned. “And good girls swallow every drop.”I moaned a yes about his dick. Daddy was about to cum. My right hand, curious, left his cock and found his heavy balls. They were thick, swelling his sack. His cum filled them. In a moment, his jizz would feel my mouth.I massaged them, eager for the treat. I didn’t care if this was wrong. My Daddy told me to do something, and I would do it. I was his good girl.“My good girl,” he echoed. My heart fluttered and my virgin pussy clenched every time he said. “My good, wonderful girl.”His hips thrust forward, pushing his cock to the back of my throat. Then he drew back while I sucked. He growled. His balls twitched. His hand tightened on my braid as his cum squirted into my mouth.I gasped at the force of the first blast of jizz splashing at the back of my throat. It was thick and salty. And then a second and third blast followed. I moaned, shocked at how hard he erupted and how much flowed into my mouth. More and more pumped into me, overflowing my mouth.I had to swallow. I gulped. Daddy’s seed poured down my throat and warmed my belly. I swallowed again and again. It was so salty, but not terrible. It was my daddy’s, and that made it better. He grunted with each blast, his head tossing back, the light illuminating the primal passion crossing his face.And then he grunted the last time. “Mmm, so good. Melody, you did a great job giving you first blowjob.”His cock pulled from my mouth. “Thank you, Daddy.” Then I realized some of his cum trickled down my chin. My eyes widened. “I’m sorry, Daddy, I really did my best to swallow all your jizz.”He laughed and pulled on my braid. I winced and stood. “Sweetheart, your mother can’t always contain my flood, either. I know you swallowed as much as you could. But let’s get you cleaned up.” He knelt before me and reached beneath my miniskirt. He yanked down my panties. The hot, tart musk of my pussy filled my nose. He chuckled again. “Someone’s excited. He held up my panties. A dark spot soaked the material even darker. I blushed as he reached out and wiped my face clean. I smelled my pussy even stronger. I had the sudden urge to taste myself. I had always been curious, but chickened out licking the juicy crotch. Daddy pocketed the panties in his jeans and said, “Well, let’s continue. Daddy loved the rest of my outfits. He told me to wear the miniskirt and belly shirt and we headed to the counter to pay. I was so aware I didn’t have panties on beneath. Cool, air-conditioned breezes swirled up my legs and caressed my bare lips. I trembled as Daddy paid, my hands constantly pulling down the skirt, making sure I didn’t show anything. Daddy noticed. It amused him. I had to walk in front of Daddy on the way to the lingerie store to buy me new bras and panties. Every time I glanced back, he had a hungry smile on my lips, his eyes locked on my ass. My cheeks burned. My pussy leaked excitement. I felt the juices trickled down my thighs. People had to notice. It was so embarrassing. But Daddy wanted me to do it. Even though my cheeks burned with shame, I was also so horny. I could explode at the slightest touch. No wonder Mom did everything Dad wanted it if was this exciting to obey and be a good girl.

Jack was behind me, one step down the narrow staircase. The sun was high in the cloudless sky, and the smell of the garbage by the door filled my nose. The door opened and there was Rachel, bright-eyed and smiling. She invited us in.

It was a small, three storey house on an estate near the primary school. We walked into the living room and sat down on a couch. The three of us drank coffee and talked for a while about all the things that’d changed in the last several years. Rachel was now married; she had an eight-year-old daughter and was working part-time behind the counter of a service station a few streets away.

We soon ran out of small talk and I knew it was time to tell her about the real reason we were in town. I was considering how to bring it up without sounding like a conspiracy theorist, when Jack went ahead and beat me to it. He told her all about his social work and the case files and the lack of investigation. He said we were down here to find information about any of the missing children, and asked if she knew about anyone who had gone missing.

Earlier that morning, I called up my sister. She’s a few years younger than me, and after hearing the kid in the park the previous night, I had to learn more. I asked her, when she’d been at school in the years below me, if she’d ever heard about the Gnawbone.

It turned out she had. In fact my question came as quite a surprise to her.

“Doesn’t everyone know that old story?”

Apparently, in the years after we first heard of and went looking for the Gnawbone, it had become the most popular ghost story for kids to tell each other in the lower years. She told me the kids all used to talk about it for a while at that age, but it was generally forgotten about in the later years.

One particular memory that it brought back for my sister is a rumour she heard around age ten or eleven. One of the girls from the other school across town had supposedly disappeared and was never seen at school again. The reason, her classmates decided, was the Gnawbone. It had taken her away into the woods to eat her.

My sister said she never really believed it herself, I guess I was the only one in our family who would’ve at the time. She never did forget it though.

And then, a couple of hours later in Rachel’s living room, her eight-year-old daughter Sarah peeked her head around the doorway to the living room.

“Are you talking about Tracey?” She asked.

Rachel walked over to shoo her out of the room, but before she could, Jack said “Did you know Tracey?”

She was one of the kids he had found out about.

Sarah nodded. “I haven’t seen her since last year,” She said, “The teachers all say she moved but she didn’t say goodbye.”

Rachel just stood there looking stunned that her daughter knew someone who could’ve gone missing under suspicious circumstances. I can’t say I blame her. Jack kept on talking though, worried her mother would soon stop his questioning.

“Did Tracey ever hang out with anyone older than her?” He asked.

Sarah shook her head. “No. The other kids say something else though.”

“What do they say?” Said Jack.

“That the Gnawbone got her.”

Jack excused himself and we stepped out the front door before Rachel could process what had just happened. We walked across the street to where we parked the car. I turned the key in the ignition and pulled away onto the road. We both knew where we had to look next.

We pulled up a few minutes later by the path down Landing Lane. It was midday and it was quiet. Jack stepped out of the car and I followed suit.

“Do you think we’ll be able to find the asylum again?” Said Jack.

“Maybe, it was pretty deep in the woods. I don’t exactly remember the way,” I said.

We walked up the path and turned off down the trail to the river.

“Do you really believe it?” I asked, “I mean, that there’s a creature called the Gnawbone out here?”

“I don’t know,” Jack replied, “But I get the feeling the stories stuck around for a reason.”

The two of us followed the trail across the bridge, and turned left toward the old weir we hadn’t seen in thirteen years. It looked no different than it did back then, water trickling down the cracked concrete, between piles of twigs and dead leaves. We walked on past and into the treeline.

The woods were calm and still, no birds singing or breeze drifting through the branches. All I could hear was the sound of my footsteps over the dirt trail in time with Jack’s just ahead of me. We plodded through the woods for minute after long minute until we came to a patch Jack thought looked familiar. I wasn’t so sure, but we left the path and shoved our way through the overgrown brush.

After a long time spent tangled in long and sharp trees, we didn’t seem to be getting anywhere. We were going in a straight line, at least I thought we were, but even then, we were only kids when we came through the first time. We could easily have been going around in circles and been none the wiser.

“Are you sure this is right?” I asked Jack.

“Of course not,” He replied, “It seemed like the best shot though.”

“Maybe we should go another direction?”

We changed our heading and pushed on through endless leaves and branches, the sunlight trickling down from above not revealing much of anything. Then I heard Jack up ahead.

“Hey, I think I found it!”

I crouched under a low branch and found myself in the clearing with the row of pine trees, just how I remembered from our last trip.

“Wow, it really wasn’t a dream then,” I said.

We walked up the road and long the line of trees. I didn’t really know what to expect when we’d finally get there, or what kind of answers the old building might hold. Whatever we’d find though, I was sure would be the key to our mystery. Then I saw it, looming over the path like a shadow.

The abandoned asylum looked no different to how I remembered it. The cracked ceiling tiles and the layers of moss and the shattered windows seemed exactly as we had left them. Except for one tiny detail. Someone had written in spray paint the words: *The Pleasure Room* above the doorway.

“Was that always there?” Said Jack.

“I don’t think so,” I said.

Since there were no obvious signs of life, we walked up the steps and pushed the door open. It creaked, creaked, creaked open, the sound echoing in the room beyond. I peered through the widening gap and saw the same empty reception with the wooden desk built in to the corner. Jack and I stepped inside.

We walked up the staircase at the back of the room, having decided to start in the place we knew best. Coming out at the top, we stepped into the ward with the lines of hospital beds in either direction. I turned right, and stopped almost immediately. There again was the graffitied poem that scared us as kids.

*I walk the trees, night by night*

*I know each one by name and sight*

*I find the children all alone*

*And rip and tear and gnaw the bones*

“I’d forgotten what it said exactly,” I said, “No wonder it scared us.”

“Yeah, there must have been some messed up teenagers back then,” Said Jack.

“I hope so,” I said.

“Hey that must’ve been where the name came from, ‘*gnaw the bones’*,” Said Jack.

We turned away and paced the room looking for anything else of interest. Paint was peeling from the walls and shards of glass lay in small puddles where the afternoon sun entered. We walked past rusty hospital beds until one of them caught both of our attention at once. Jack and I rushed over to it. On each side, attached to the metal, were a pair of handcuffs.

“What the hell…?” Said Jack.

The dots were joining together for us now. The painted signs on both this building and the train cars, coupled with this was too much to brush off as nothing.

“What do we do now?” I said, “Tell the police about all this?”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Said Jack.

“Why not? You really think this is some kind of cover up?” I said.

“That’s what it looks like to me,” Said Jack.

“So what else do we do?”

“I don’t know, maybe someone out of town?”

“Maybe,” I said, “But we need more to give them, right? How do we know these weren’t here thirteen years ago?”

“I don’t remember them,” Said Jack.

“Maybe we should try Roger? He might remember if we don’t.”

“Alright, it’s a start, I guess. His old number doesn’t work anymore though.”

We walked through every other room with an eagle eye, but we didn’t find anything else of interest. Having taken photos of the graffiti and the handcuffs, we left the building and stumbled our way through the woods until we eventually made it back to the car. As I drove back to my bed and breakfast, Jack scoured the internet on his phone to find a way of contacting Roger.

“I can’t find him anywhere, no social media at all,” Said Jack.

“Anyone else who might know him?” I asked.

Jack kept on searching.

“I’ve found his dad’s business number, I could try that,” He said.

I looked across at the clock on the dashboard. It was before five.

“Try it,” I said, silently praying. Having another person helping would be a big improvement.

Jack dialled and it rang forever, but eventually someone picked up and answered. Jack didn’t spend long speaking to him, and from what I heard it didn’t go as I was hoping. Jack took the phone away from his ear and sat in silence.

“What is it? What did he say?” I said.

“He invited us to go and meet them,” Said Jack.

“Okay,” I said, “Maybe they just want us to meet in person.”

“I just realised something,” Said Jack.

“What?”

“You remember that toy giraffe we found? In the train cars?”

“Yeah?”

“Roger had one just like it.”

Background: my mom is 55, has 2 herniated discs and arthritis in her back. She’s lost a lot of strength and mobility, and she was diagnosed with Lyme in 2024 as well which has left her very tired, with lots of persistent side effects, and no energy to do much. I want her to continue to be able to enjoy time outside, and be able to join me on adventures when she comes to visit (enjoying the river trails, going for ice cream or a coffee as I do on my own bike), and I figured this would be a great thing for her. 

So essentially, I’m looking for something with a low step through, not too heavy, and very comfy (obviously we can swap the saddle if need be). I’m hoping to keep things under $3000 and just have some to start looking into before I take her to my local shops to see what she likes!

Last year, I bought my dad a card and his favorite candy bar. He came home from work and I handed it to him. He opened it and read it, looked at me, and said ""thanks, but I'm not really a card guy. You don't have to get me cards."" And then he just put it on the counter and left. It made me really upset, not going to lie, but I just shook it off and shrugged and said, ""okay. I wanted to do something."" I still remember and think about it. In the past my brother and I would get joint ""from us"" cards and he never had a problem receiving them. 

I told my mom about it recently and she is adamant I need to do something this year but does not offer me help because ""it's my dad."" (her husband, btw). But what do I do? He doesn't like to go anywhere, works all the time, has all the tools and coffee mugs and shirts (he actually did like the shirt I got him a prior year). I feel like anything I do will not be appreciated, in a way. 

I'm just kind of lost and not planning to do anything, except maybe try to spend time with him before he has to work Sunday. But my mom makes it feel like I'm a massive asshole if I don't do anything. Which, but the way, my brother doesn't do anything for either Mother's Day or Father's Day and somehow gets a pass every year. 

Edit: Also want to specify I'm an adult lol I feel like at my age, this shouldn't be so hard

Back story: I had a partial hysterectomy almost 20 yrs ago due to endometriosis.kept my ovaries per Dr's suggestion so I didn't need hormone replacement.  I was 26 @ the time. Was having horrible periods. Passed blood clots most of the time. Pms was horrible. Would always feel horrible atleast a week prior to startkng my monthly. Bad headaches, cramps , back aches. It was just horrible. March 2006 found out i had endo stage 2 at the time. Obgyn at the time only wanted me to take birth control to see if it helped. It didnt. Fast forward to Sept 2006 5 obgyns later finaly found  a dr at a woman's  hospital that listened to how miserable i was. (Male dr) all others were female drs. He did another laproscoptic exploratory surgery to confirm endometriosis diagnosis. I was stage 4 by that time. Okay fast forward. A few yrs  ago I say a few probably 10 yrs or so ago. Had obgyn dr tell me I was reaching perimenopause. I was like OK. Didn't really think nothing of it until recently like the past yr. 1st I was diagnosed with ADHD December of 2023. Inattentive type. Was seeking help with GAD & Depression.. was put on Prozac, horrible side affect. And then Lexapro, same horrible side affects. Then my dr mentioned the adhd symptoms I was having and mentions wellbutin. And OMG!!! What a difference it made. (I didn't want to try a stimulant..Addiction runs in my family. It worked great for a while 6 months or so. Now I'm on Vyvanse & Wellbutrin.Been on both since January 2024. It working great up until about 6mnths ago. 1st I started having heart palpitations. Started October 2024..Literally started noticing them the same day my dad passed away. So of course I brushed it of as stess from his unexpected death. Dealt with that for a while. Back and forth to cardiologist.. been cleared. Still had them from time to time. I noticed my 1 coffee i was having in the morning mixed with my meds is what was causing them or so I thought. Now I'm thinking it's hormone related. (I mentioned that to the cardiologist and he disagreed. Anyhow. I have learned what triggered them. And I deal with them accordingly. Don't have them very often anymore..it was quite distressing & scary. Had ti give up my coffee sad 😔. Now it seems like over night i started noticing my skin change. My hair falls out way more then usual. I'm so damn moody I could literally punch someone.Did I mention the freaking brain fog? I have no interest in sex!!! I mean NO INTEREST!!!! I've been extremely exhausted. Feel like my meds dont work anymore. (Unless I dont take them). Recently about 2 was ago I woke up with what I thought was a horrible crick in my neck.Radiated down to like the top of the shoulder area to my back just below shoulder area. Problem is it never went away like it would normal do with in a day or so. I wake up every morning in terrblel pain. Some days worse then others. The  difference is now I can turn my head. It's still painful. But its mobile. Not like the first few days. I started having issues with bowel movements. Im constipated for a day or 2. Then diarrhea a day or so. I've had like a little indigestion. Not horrible. But very noticeable. For a while now. Nausea that comes and goes everyday.  No appetite. When I do eat sometimes  it would make my stomach hurt. Very gassy. My back was hurting. I just feel like I'm a different person. The anxiety and depression has been in over drive. Any insight is appreciated. Am I going crazy? Forgot to add. Had my PCP check hormones thru blood test 2 wks ago when I went in for annual. Dr only tested estradiol and fsh. Everything was normal per dr. E was 236 & fsh was 9.0 This can't be normal.

Sinabihan ko lang na ingat lang sa ganyan at hinay-hinay lang sa paggamit ng ganyan kasi baka maging dependent yung katawan niya sa ganyan kapag inabuso.

Later, si papa naman, nagpapabili rin sa akin ng ""Dok Natural"" sa shopee kasi pino-promote daw nung dok atoy na pinapanood niya sa peysbuk.

The ad text: 

Hello! I have one bedroom available in my peaceful, queer-friendly 2BR/2BA apartment in Shoreline.

✨ THE ROOM: 10x11 ft with a large north-facing window (great natural light!) and a 6x2 closet. Rent: $935/month + half of utilities (typically $100–$150/mo). $900 security deposit. You’ll have exclusive use of the larger main bathroom. Sorry, no couples or additional pets. Room is for one person only. Available for move-in as soon as landlord approves you. They will run checks. We’ll split the $300 roommate addition fee ($150 each.) Total up front cost after rent, deposit, and split fee = $1985.

✨ THE APARTMENT: 908 sq ft 4th-floor unit with elevator access. East-facing living room with balcony and mountain views on clear days. In-unit washer/dryer. 4-minute walk to the E Line (Aurora & N 200th St). Free street parking is easy; optional gated parking is $75/month. Accessibility: a few front steps, but possible side door access—happy to discuss.

✨ THE VIBE: Quiet, introvert-friendly energy—low noise overall, with occasional music or visiting partner shenanigans. Think forest creature/fae/forest gothly sacred space.

✨ IMPORTANT NOTES: No smoking or drug use. Light/infrequent alcohol okay—open to discussion. | Sensitive to strong scents—let’s chat if you have fragrance needs. | Let’s keep our spaces tidy. Having a neat, tidy space is important to me. | I’m gluten-free so cross-contamination awareness is important. | I work in healthcare and appreciate a quiet vibe after 8pm on work nights (2–3 nights/week).

About the roomies
✨ CURRENT RESIDENTS: Just me-ish** 30’s, non-binary, queer, neurodivergent. Ex-IT, now in healthcare. I love aerial arts, circus training, hiking, climbing, and cozy reading sessions with tea. I value mutual respect, clear communication, and a good balance of social and solo time. **My teenager visits from out of state (up to 4 weeks some summers, ~1 week in winter) but uses my bathroom when here. +2 sweet cats.

✨ WE MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT IF: You’re queer-friendly | You enjoy a calm, tidy home | You’re cool with a friendly introvert who loves solo time and the occasional shared meal/chat | You’re fine with very infrequent teen visits | You’re respectful of scent and gluten sensitivities | You understand from above that additional animals are not accepted.

La Ree Fragrances – 4-Month Review & Ranking (15ml Bottles)
I’ve been testing out these six fragrances from La Ree over the past four months and wanted to share my rankings and thoughts. Overall, solid quality for the price, especially if you're into dupes with personality.

1. Figments (Inspired by LV Imagination)

My favorite of the bunch. This one opens bright and juicy—Citron, Calabrian Bergamot, and Sicilian Orange jump out right away. It's fresh, a bit effervescent, and classy without trying too hard. Great for daily wear, especially in warm weather. Compliment magnet.

2. Hephaestus (Inspired by God of Fire)

This one surprised me. Mango, Ginger, Lemon, and Red Berries give it a tropical but spicy twist. It smells vibrant and mango fruity, fitting the inspiration. Okay projection and lasts 2 hours  on my skin. I’ve worn it casually and get curious comments.

3. Fortress Rumkale (Inspired by Halfeti)

The most relaxing and easygoing of the bunch. This one is smooth and refined. Top notes include Cypress Leaf, Saffron, Cardamom, Artemisia, Bergamot, and Grapefruit—a lot going on, but it blends beautifully. I reach for this when I want something comforting but still interesting.

4. Night Wizard (Inspired by Black Phantom)

This one is sweet and masculine. Coffee, dark chocolate, sugarcane—sweet, dark, and rich. Definitely an acquired taste and not for everyone, but it works great for date nights. I don’t wear it often, but when I do, I commit.

5. Odin's Voyage

Could’ve ranked higher because I genuinely like it. Smells a bit dated. I wear it to the gym—it’s bright and energizing. Lemon, Bergamot, and Pink Pepper make it zesty with a hint of spice. Not super unique, but dependable.

6. Monkey Metal (Inspired by Tony I. Monkey Special)

This one just didn’t click with me. Smells like an incense stick burning in a dive bar—not terrible, just not my vibe. Maybe it needs more time to macerate. I’ve barely worn it, but the one or two times I did, I surprisingly didn’t get any complaints. So there’s that.


---

Final Thoughts:
La Ree is putting out some really interesting and wearable interpretations. Figments is a gem, and Hephaestus brings a unique twist. If i were to repurchase i would get those 2. Definitely worth sampling especially for the price in my opinion.  ",1,1749785571.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

Liam and I started talking back in October of 2024. Liam recently broke up with his long term, girlfriend. (Q) Liam and I went on 3 dates back in October. The first date was a overall good experience. but it ended with a bad kiss. He laughed and said you arevnot the best kisser. which has caused me to be a little self-conscious about kissing other people. we had another date now comes forward Halloween. we decide to go trick-or-treating together with his friends. His ex Gf (Q) kept messaging him throughout the night. which caused him to stop paying attention to me and others around him. I told him it felt like he wasn’t interested. I was feeling a little insecure because I know (Q) is a lot skinny than me when i am a bigger girl. We broke it off after we were done trick-or-treating. 
We decided to be friends and then he continued to flirt with me and I told him I felt like he was playing with my emotions so I decided to block him on everything. After we broke it off (Q) message me. Something along the line of this “please be careful with him. And take your time with liam because of his ocd n shit.” A couple months passed by. I’m starting to talk to another guy which quickly ends soon. I unblocked liam. A week after he messaged me. We start talking and decided to get coffee together.  We get coffee and decided to try again. But then he start being self pity and saying he going to hurt me again. I argued that it was my decision to start this again. But it didnt make liam agree so we broke it off again. A week after we were both we hung out again.  We had a really meaningful conversation about everything. We made out in my truck. I felt pretty good after that like we are getting on the right track after everything. But once again the circle repeats itself he does self pity thing. I block him. Over a month i unblock him. Except on messages so He messaged me. We start talking and decided maybe we should just hooked up instead. So we just make out a couple times. Never going anywhere else. We stopped because i was very emotional invested. We talked as friends but i was short n dry. He followed my ex gf (P). He told he was thinking of message her i told him i was uncomfortable with that. We argued over this. I said if i messaged (Q) how he would feel. He said i would be mad and jealous. I was like okay then you see my point. We drifted apart but he starts messaging occasionally i was short n dry again. Until one night he calls me very upset. He explains that he was messaging (P). And that P was best friends with his ex (Q) and  she told liam that (Q) cheated on him. But i was blind with rage and yelled at him for going behind my back and messaging p. He yells at me saying that he just found out that the LOVE OF HIS LIFE was cheating on. I just hung up n blocked him. That was a month ago but a couple days i had a really bad sexual experience with a guy. I need to just talk to him. I unblock him and call him. I was crying n upset. He calms me down. We been speaking again. I just don’t know what to do with him. It seems like i cant keep him block. It like i am tied with him somehow. I really do like him and dream of a relationship with him. But i don’t think he will ever actually like me. I feel like a only option to him sometimes. I just want him to love me so bad. ",1,1749785507.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

the sound of dishes and conversation 
filled the lively atmosphere

I could pick out bits of conversation
I still didn't speak French all that well 

but I knew I was surrounded by love

sitting in that cafe 

alone
Longing for a love of my own

like a spot of grey on a white canvas

after I finished my coffee I paid the bill and left

as I walked down those Paris alleys 
seeing all the smiles 

a tear slipped down my cheek

I let out a prayer:

""God you see me
please don't leave me
I know I've been gone a while
but if you're there
please don't leave me
in this pit I of dark despair
send someone
someone to lead me 
someone with all this beauty
I could share
someone to love 
someone to hold 
but more importantly
someone to lead me back to you""

I wanna say it was about a quarter of an hour later I was walking the Paris streets

it was quite beautiful that night 

the perfect temperature with a slight breeze

as I walked I saw a lady standing

all alone so pretty and fair

she said I looked lonely and asked if 
she could walk with me

we went down to the river 

we walked the Seine
the music and lights 
illuminated the scene

there were laughs and stories

of two lives waiting to be shared 

as we saw the sun start to peek over the hills 
she invited to follow her

we walked a short distance to a small church

that was ten years ago 

now we are expecting our first child
 
a baby girl named Alya 

now I'm reminded of that night 
in mid July of 1952 

when God saw me 

and made my dreams come true

She glanced at the clock, then at the maid, whose patience had clearly worn thin.""Clear it away,"" Raelyn said quietly.  
It was her birthday, but her husband and son hadn't come home. The maid began clearing the table quickly, muttering under her breath, ""Mrs. Mitchell, not to be rude, but you knew Mr. Cruz and Mr. Leo wouldn’t be back. Why go through all this trouble? You’ve heated it three times already. It’s exhausting. Honestly, whether you're a wife or a mother, you've failed. Otherwise, why would your husband and son avoid you?"" she added, her tone sharp.""Yeah, I've failed,"" Raelyn replied with a bitter smile. Even the maid wasn't shy about taking shots at her now.  
She understood very well that the maid’s attitude mirrored the way the Mitchells treated her. If her own family didn't care, why would anyone else? The maid noticed Raelyn's expression and paused, softening slightly. ""People always hold on to things that don't belong to them. If I were you, I'd let go. It would set you free, helping both yourself and others. Raelyn didn't respond, but the words sank in. The maid finished cleaning and left her alone. Raelyn switched off the lights and took the cake to her bedroom. She sat on the couch, opened the cake box, and placed a candle on top.  
She lit the candle. Just then, a WhatsApp notification buzzed, a video message.  
Inside a VIP hospital room, her husband, Cruz Mitchell, and son, Leo Mitchell, sat beside a sickly woman in bed.  
  
She was Hazel Winslow—Cruz's childhood friend, the one he'd been promised to.  
  
The video was from her.  
  
""Cruz, I'm so sorry for keeping you here so late,"" Hazel's weak voice came through, interrupted by a couple of coughing fits.  
  
""It's alright. I need to make sure you're okay,"" Cruz replied softly, his voice tinged with affection.  
  
So, Cruz had spent the entire day with her ...  
  
Raelyn's lips twisted into a faint smile.  
  
She couldn't remember the last time Cruz had spoken to her with such kindness.  
  
Affection?  
  
She wasn't sure when it had all changed, but now, every word from him felt more like an accusation.  
  
""Don't worry, Hazel. Dad and I want to stay here with you. We don't want to go home,"" Leo's childish voice echoed from the video, his small body snuggling into Hazel's arms.  
  
""I like you, Hazel. I wish you were my mom.""  
  
The video ended abruptly.  
  
Raelyn set her phone on the table, her gaze fixed on the candle that had been burning for what felt like hours.  
  
With a quiet decision, she blew out the flame.  
  
""Happy birthday, Raelyn,"" she murmured, almost to herself.  
  
By the time Cruz returned home, it was well past midnight. The house was dark and silent.  
  
The light he always found waiting for him, the one she kept on no matter how late, was absent tonight.  
  
His brows furrowed in irritation. He handed Leo off to the maid, then turned toward their bedroom.  
  
He noticed the light still on inside. His expression softened, just a little.  
  
Raelyn sat on the couch, her luggage packed neatly beside her. On the coffee table sat a divorce agreement.  
  
For a moment, Cruz's face, softened by the sight of the light, hardened again. ""Raelyn, what is this? Are you starting drama again?"" he asked, exhaustion weighing on his voice.  
  
Raelyn didn't feel like explaining. She didn't care to argue over his version of what he called her drama.  
  
""I'm getting a divorce,"" she said flatly.  
  
Cruz ripped off his tie, tossing it onto the sofa. His gaze fell on the cake, the candle long burned out.  
  
""Today's your birthday?"" he asked, surprise flickering in his eyes. He had forgotten. His assistant hadn't reminded him.  
  
""It doesn't matter,"" Raelyn replied, shaking her head. She pushed the divorce agreement toward him. ""Sign it. We're getting divorced.""  
  
""Why?"" Cruz's voice tightened in confusion, frustration leaking into his tone. He tried to endure her so-called nonsense. ""Is it because I forgot your birthday?""  
  
He shot a mocking glance at the agreement, then reached out, flipping through it slowly with two long fingers.  
  
""Leaving with nothing? Raelyn, where do you think you're going? Without me, where can you go?""  
  
Raelyn let out a bitter laugh, her heart growing colder.  
  
So, this is what he thought. He assumed she was trapped, with nowhere to go, no one to turn to. That was why he drained her love dry, feeling untouchable.  
  
*That bastard.*  
  
""I have somewhere to go. You don't need to worry about that. Just sign it, and tomorrow we'll go to city hall to finish things,"" she said, her voice icy.  
  
Her words struck Cruz like a slap. His tone turned cold, matching hers. ""Are you sure about this?""  
  
Raelyn didn't answer. She tossed the pen onto the table, right in front of him. ""Stop talking. Just sign it.""  
  
For a moment, Cruz seemed lost, staring at her in shock. But it didn't last. He inhaled deeply, massaging his temple.  
  
""Fine. Divorce. But Leo's custody? That's not up for discussion.""  
  
Just then, Leo, who had woken up, dashed into the room, grabbing Cruz's arm. ""I want to stay with Dad! I don't want to stay with you! You're a witch! You're a temptress!""  
  
""Leo!"" Cruz snapped, his voice sharp.  
  
Leo, still reeling from the harsh words, erupted into sobs. ""I didn't say anything wrong! She's just a worthless housewife, not good enough for Dad! Grandma and Aunt say the same thing! If it weren't for her, Hazel would be my mom!""  
  
His voice cracked, each word biting with resentment. ""Leo, you—""  
  
""I don't want Leo anymore. I don't want anything. All I want is a divorce.""  
  
Raelyn's voice was ice, cutting through the tension. No pleading, no hesitation. The decision was final.  
  
Cruz's face hardened, his lips pressed tight. He hadn't expected her to say it, not like this.  
  
She had risked her life to bring Leo into the world.  
  
She had cradled him with her own hands, nurtured him with love, every moment a sacrifice for him.  
  
And now, she was walking away from him?  
  
Even Leo, caught in his own hurt, froze for a heartbeat, disbelief hanging in the air.  
  
But it didn't last. A wicked grin crept across his face. ""Great! Dad, hurry up and divorce her, then Hazel can be my mom!""  
  
Cruz didn't acknowledge Leo, his gaze locked onto Raelyn with a cold intensity. ""I'm asking you one last time. Are you sure about this?""  
  
Raelyn didn't flinch. ""Yes.""  
  
She watched as Cruz signed the divorce papers, the sound of the pen scratching against the paper sharp in the quiet room. Then, without a word, she grabbed her own copy and stood, pulling her suitcase toward the door.  
  
""9 a.m. tomorrow. City Hall. Don't be late.""  
  
Suddenly, Cruz's hand shot out, wrapping around her wrist. His grip was firm, his palm broad, veins standing out beneath his skin, a strength that once made her feel safe. Now, it repulsed her.  
  
She had once adored that hand—the man who controlled it. Now, the touch felt foreign, cold.  
  
""Let go,"" she said, her voice low but resolute.  
  
*Why hold on any longer?*  
  
*This is the ending everyone deserved. Divorce. Freedom.*  
  
Cruz's voice was laced with venom, a mocking tone in his words. ""Can't wait, huh? Got someone else, don't you?""  
  
Raelyn felt a weight pressing on her chest, but she stood tall, her resolve unwavering. ""Cruz, I've never hated you more than I do right now.""  
  
For a moment, his grip loosened, as if her words had hit him harder than any of their past arguments.  
  
""It's late. If you're going, you can leave tomorrow,"" he muttered, his voice almost softer than she expected.  
  
Raelyn didn't answer. She jerked her wrist free and turned on her heel.She grabbed her suitcase, her heart feeling numb. Without a single glance back, she walked out the door, leaving behind the place that had once held her captive for four long years.        



**Chapter 2 Why Are You Arguing With a Kid?**



At the airport, Raelyn prepared to board her flight.  
  
Just as she was about to step onto the plane, her phone rang.  
  
She handed her boarding pass to the attendant and answered the call.  
  
Before she could say anything, Leo's voice came through loud and clear.  
  
""I want rainbow ravioli!""  
  
Raelyn paused briefly and glanced at the caller ID, realizing it was Cruz.  
  
""There's some frozen in the fridge,"" she said casually, taking her boarding pass back and heading toward the gate.  
  
""The maid says there's no more!"" Leo protested, his voice rising with a sharp edge.  
  
At his age, whenever he raised his voice, it became high-pitched and piercing.  
  
Raelyn had always been firm about not letting Leo scream or raise his voice, especially in public.  
  
But Leo had a playful streak, and when Raelyn repeated herself too much, he'd get upset.  
  
She frowned slightly, speaking with a relaxed tone, ""That means there's no more.""  
  
""No!"" Leo's voice cracked, now nearly a wail. ""Come back and make it for me! I want it now!""  
  
Raelyn took a deep breath, her voice still calm and distant. ""Ask Hazel to make it for you.""  
  
There was a brief silence on the line before Leo's crying filled the air, loud and uncontrolled.  
  
After a few moments, Cruz's voice cut through the noise.  
  
""Raelyn, why are you arguing with a kid? He's so young. He doesn't understand!""  
  
Raelyn had already entered the plane. She flashed a brief smile to the flight attendant as she handed over her bag and made her way to her seat in first class.  
  
""Kids may not understand, but adults should,"" she replied softly.  
  
Before Leo had turned two, he had been a well-behaved child, always attached to Raelyn, convinced his mother was the best.  
  
When had that changed?  
  
Most likely, it was when Hazel returned to Amberville ...  
  
Things that Raelyn forbade, Hazel allowed.  
  
Foods Raelyn refused to let him eat, Hazel gave him without question.  
  
And the Mitchells, who had never held Raelyn in high regard, favored Hazel.  
  
Slowly but surely, the pattern had emerged—Raelyn was the bad guy, the villain!  
  
""Cruz, we're divorced now. Don't contact me again,"" Raelyn said firmly.  
  
Without waiting for a response, she hung up and powered off her phone.  
  
As the plane began its ascent, she left everything from the past behind.  
  
...  
  
Four years later, in the Dean's Office in Amberville Central Hospital.  
  
Raelyn sat on the couch, one leg crossed over the other, her posture anything but proper.  
  
The hospital dean, Osbert Walton, walked over and playfully tapped her on the head. ""Sit up straight. Don't you teach your kids good posture at home?""  
  
Raelyn shifted slightly, sitting up straight, and pulled out a packet of medicinal tea from her bag. ""Here, for you. Don't drink it all at once; it takes quite a bit of effort to make.""  
  
Making the tea wasn't particularly hard, but the ingredients were rare and difficult to find.  
  
Osbert chuckled as he accepted the tea gratefully. ""You're the best, my dear. My health depends on this tea you make.  
  
""Here, have some of mine,"" he added with a smile.  
  
Raelyn took the teacup that Osbert handed her, savoring a slow, rich sip.  
  
*Mmm, top-tier Feywild tea.*  
  
""Raelyn, how long are you planning to stay in Amberville?"" Osbert asked, his voice warm.  
  
""Probably for a while,"" she replied.  
  
She had a work contract for a project, and they had just secured the rights to adapt one of her works. With production starting soon, as the head writer, she needed to be involved.  
  
There were also a few other things she had to handle.  
  
The elderly man chuckled, his eyes lighting up. ""Rae, you seriously considered seeing patients here? Maybe even mentoring some students?""  
  
""No! There's no way I'm doing that,"" she answered firmly.  
  
Osbert had asked her this question multiple times before, and each time, she had no interest in it at all.  
  
He was about to say more when Raelyn's phone rang. Relieved, she answered it quickly and excused herself.  
  
As soon as she stepped out, the hospital office director knocked and entered. ""Dr. Walton, Mr. Stuart is here.""  
  
A moment later, a lively old man walked in. His gaze immediately fell on the steaming pot of Feywild tea sitting on Osbert's table—clearly, someone had already drunk from it.  
  
""Well, well, who was here earlier to make you break out the good stuff? Even your precious Feywild tea?"" he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
  
Osbert smiled. ""Who else could it be?""  
  
Stuart Mitchell raised his brows in surprise. ""That holistic medicine practitioner you mentioned?""  
  
""Too bad you missed her. Otherwise, you could've met her,"" Osbert replied nonchalantly, sipping his tea.  
  
Stuart sighed, his voice tinged with regret. ""Yeah, my health's been going downhill these past few years.""  
  
Osbert wrinkled his nose. ""I remember you were doing fine a few years ago. When did it start acting up?""  
  
Stuart thought for a moment, pondering. ""Probably about four years ago ... ""  
  
Ever since that troublemaking Cruz stirred things up with the divorce, Stuart had been brooding, getting angry daily, and feeling short of breath. Now, his health was falling apart.  
  
Osbert, noticing Stuart was dressed sharply in a suit, asked curiously, ""Where did you come from today?""  
  
""Oh, from the company. My grandson, Cruz, dropped me off,"" Stuart replied, tossing his jacket off casually as if he were at home. ""I bumped into a friend's mom on my way up, and since she's staying here, I figured I'd drop by and say hello.""  
  
...  
  
In the hospital elevator, Raelyn stood in the corner, scrolling through her phone to pass the time.  
  
A few entertainment news headlines caught her eye.  
  
""The Mitchells' Heir Spotted Late-Night with a Lady,"" ""Inside Scoop: Dawnridge Corporation CEO Cruz About to Tie the Knot"" ...  
  
Though the pictures were blurry, Raelyn recognized the couple immediately—Cruz and Hazel.  
  
*About to tie the knot?*  
  
*Seems like their wedding is coming up soon.*  
  
Raelyn couldn't help but feel a bit of irony. Cruz had sworn up and down that there was nothing between him and Hazel—that it was all in her head, her jealousy taking over.  
  
During their marriage, they were never in the tabloids. Cruz never acknowledged her in public, and the world didn't even know he was married.  
  
She had assumed it was just Cruz's principle—he didn't want his private life out there.  
  
But now, it seemed like every principle could be broken in the name of ""true love.""  
  
The elevator stopped with a soft ding and the doors opened.  
  
A person stepped inside.  
  
The man was tall, and when he positioned himself in front of her, he blocked much of the light.  
  
She didn't look up, shifting slightly to the side.  
  
Her phone rang, and it was Lydia Xander calling. Raelyn answered, greeting her in the same way she always did. ""Babe, are you here?""  
  
""Rae, I'm so sorry. Something came up at the shop, and I need to handle it. I can't pick you up. But don't worry. My boyfriend is on his way to get you. He should be there soon.""  
  
""Okay, I got it,"" Raelyn said, a smile forming as she hung up.  
  
Suddenly, she felt a cold gaze from above.  
  
She couldn't help but glance up, meeting a pair of dark, intense eyes.  
  
It was Cruz.  
  
The man was taller than she remembered, even more so than before. Four years had passed, and the time had changed him.  
  
His once round and soft face had become sharper, more angular. His eyes held a certain intensity, like emotions were swirling beneath them.  
  
He took a step forward, closing the gap between them, and the tension in the air became heavier.  
  
Just then, the elevator reached the ground floor.  
  
""Excuse me. Thanks.""  
  
Raelyn politely but distantly brushed past him, not pausing, not even sparing him a glance.  
  
She moved by him as though he were a stranger.  
  
Before coming back to Amberville, she had already braced herself for the possibility of running into Cruz.  
  
So, even in this moment, she didn't feel much.  
  
Everything between them was in the past, and she never looked back.  
  
Behind her, footsteps echoed.  
  
Then, a hand gripped her wrist.  
  
""Raelyn, after disappearing for four years, don't you think you owe me an explanation?""  
  
Raelyn laughed at the absurdity of it. ""Mr. Mitchell, you're my ex-husband. What exactly gives you the right to question me now?""  
  
Cruz's breath hitched, his chest rising and falling as he tried to control himself. His eyes reddened slightly. ""As the father of our son, don't I have the right to know where his mother has been?""  
  
Raelyn tried to pull her wrist away, but his grip tightened.  
  
""I don't even want my son anymore. So what does it matter what you think?""  
  
""Raelyn!""  
  
Honk!  
  
Suddenly, two car horns blared loudly, breaking the tension between them. A car pulled up behind her, and a handsome man with a sleek haircut poked his head out the window, calling out to Raelyn.  
  
""Rae, I'm here!""



**Chapter 3 One of Those Silent Heroines**



""Hiss!""  
  
Raelyn felt her wrist being gripped tightly, the pressure making her inhale sharply in pain.  
  
""Raelyn, who is he?""  
  
The man's gaze stayed locked on her, his voice demanding and firm. ""Was he the one you were talking to just now?""  
  
He remembered. Raelyn had referred to the caller as ""Babe.""  
  
That was a word she had never used for him during their four years of marriage.  
  
""It's none of your business!"" Raelyn gritted her teeth, using every ounce of strength to yank her arm free from Cruz's grasp.  
  
Cruz furrowed his brows, stepping closer as if he was about to argue, but was cut off.  
  
""Cruz, I finally found you!""  
  
Hazel's voice rang out from behind them, her tone sweet and upbeat. She walked over, dressed in a stylish, tailored high-fashion suit, her long hair flowing gracefully as she moved.  
  
""My mom was so happy to see you earlier,"" she added. ""She even complained that I didn't take care of you enough after making you come all the way to the hospital when you're so busy.""  
  
With a soft laugh, she sidled up to Cruz, continuing, ""I feel so wronged—after all, you insisted on coming. Maybe next time, you can explain that to my mom.""  
  
Only then did Hazel seem to realize there were others nearby. She turned her attention to Raelyn, greeting her with a bright smile.  
  
""Ms. Cloudstone? You're back!""  
  
Hazel's smile was warm and inviting, so genuine that anyone else might have believed it was sincere. But Raelyn could see the truth—Hazel had been watching her for a while before making her way over.  
  
In that instant, Raelyn felt completely disillusioned.  
  
She didn't respond and simply turned to leave, slipping into her car and driving away.  
  
...  
  
""So, you didn't explain anything to him?"" In the living room, Lydia handed Raelyn a warm glass of milk.  
  
Lydia, a close friend from Joyville, was a well-known fashion designer specializing in dresses and gowns. Since Raelyn had decided to return to Amberville, Lydia had followed, opening a custom boutique in the most upscale mall in the city.  
  
""I didn't,"" Raelyn replied as she took a sip of her milk.  
  
""Why not?"" Lydia asked, her voice showing more agitation than Raelyn's own.  
  
""We're divorced, and there's nothing left between us. I don't owe him any explanations."" Raelyn forced a smile. ""Besides, he's about to get remarried.""  
  
""Remarried?"" Lydia's eyes widened in shock. ""To that bitch?""  
  
Lydia had a special nickname for Hazel—bitch.  
  
Raelyn used to correct her, even though it was clear Hazel had her own share of faults.  
  
But after her marriage with Cruz fell apart, Raelyn had come to realize the issues weren't entirely Hazel's fault.  
  
It was between her and Cruz; their marriage had problems long before Hazel entered the picture.  
  
Still, after a few attempts to correct Lydia, Raelyn had given up.  
  
""Yeah, her,"" Raelyn replied, taking another sip of her milk.  
  
Lydia sighed in frustration. ""You're just like one of those silent heroines in those domineering CEO-romance novels! It's maddening!""  
  
Raelyn chuckled softly at Lydia's words. ""You're wrong. In those clichés, I'm not the heroine. Cruz's fiancée is.""  
  
Raelyn would probably be viewed as the evil villain in Hazel's eyes.  
  
She was the mother of Cruz's child who had disappeared for four years before returning unexpectedly, hoping to reconnect with Cruz and rebuild her relationship with their son. Her presence was causing tension between the engaged couple.  
  
In those stories, Raelyn would be seen as the villain who foolishly believed she could reignite things with Cruz.  
  
But in most of those tales, the plot ended with the boss realizing his fiancée was his true love, while the villainess met a bitter end.  
  
Raelyn didn't care about being anyone's villainess. She had no interest in rekindling anything with Cruz.  
  
To her, the man from her past was like spoiled bread—unappealing and unpleasant to even think about.  
  
""By the way ... "" Lydia suddenly remembered. ""Did you see your son today?""  
  
Raelyn's heart gave a slight flutter at the mention of her son, whom she hadn't seen in four years. The calm composure she usually maintained wavered for a moment.  
  
*Four years ago, when I left, Leo was just a little three-year-old.*  
  
*Now, he's seven ...*  
  
*What is he like at seven?*  
  
""Mommy!"" At the sound of the sweet, soft voice, a small, warm bundle of joy dashed into Raelyn's arms.  
  
Fresh from her bath, Naomi Cloudstone's damp hair stuck to her forehead, with tiny droplets of water still clinging to her rosy cheeks. Her big, dark eyes, shining like stars, blinked up at Raelyn with pure, uncontainable happiness.  
  
""Why didn't you dry your hair? You'll catch a cold,"" Raelyn scolded gently, wrapping Naomi in her arms. She took the towel from the maid, Bethany, and began drying Naomi's hair with tender, practiced hands.  
  
Bethany laughed softly, her voice full of affection. ""Naomi missed you so much. The moment she heard your voice, she couldn't wait any longer.""  
  
Raelyn didn't blame Bethany. She had brought her along from Joyville, and Bethany had always been meticulous in caring for both her and Naomi.  
  
Besides, she knew Naomi's stubborn nature all too well. Just like her mother, Naomi was determined and unyielding.  
  
""Mommy, I was really good today. Can I skip preschool tomorrow?"" Naomi peeked out from behind the towel, her sparkling eyes full of hopeful anticipation.  
  
Raelyn's heart melted at her daughter's innocent request. But she kept her tone firm. ""No, sweetheart. You have to go.""  
  
The light in Naomi's eyes dimmed immediately. ""Fine ... ""  
  
Naomi had been born after Raelyn left Cruz four years ago. She carried Raelyn's last name—Cloudstone.  
  
Just as Raelyn had named her son Leo, hoping he would grow up to be safe and strong like the sun, she had named Naomi with hopes of her being a gentle girl who would lead a pleasant life.  
  
She had never told Cruz about Naomi. And there was no need to.  
  
Otherwise, they would get tangled up in the past again. And Raelyn wanted nothing—absolutely nothing—to do with that man anymore.  
  
...  
  
Raelyn had enrolled Naomi in an elite private school that housed preschool, kindergarten, elementary, and even middle school all on one campus.  
  
The school was strict, with exceptional teachers and cutting-edge facilities.  
  
Lydia had worked tirelessly, pulling strings to get Naomi admitted.  
  
The entrance for the preschool, kindergarten, and early elementary grades were all the same.  
  
At the school gates, Raelyn bent down, wrapping Naomi in a warm embrace as they said their goodbyes.  
  
It was Naomi's first day of preschool, the first time she would be separated from her mother for such a long stretch. Naomi pouted, her lips quivering as she fought back tears. Raelyn's heart ached at the sight of her.  
  
""Mommy, I'll listen to the teacher. But you have to be the first one to pick me up tonight,"" Naomi pleaded, clutching Raelyn's sleeve with her tiny hands.  
  
Raelyn's resolve nearly cracked at her daughter's soft, earnest words. For a brief moment, she just wanted to take Naomi in her arms and take her back home, forgetting about preschool altogether.  
  
But she held firm. Naomi was three now. It was time for her to start school.  
  
And Naomi was bright—far beyond her years. The sooner she interacted with other children, the better it would be for her.  
  
Raelyn understood that. But when the moment came to part, it was still excruciatingly hard.  
  
The teacher nearby had seen this scene countless times—parents hesitant to let go, children clinging tightly. She didn't rush them.  
  
A sleek car pulled up at the curb.  
  
Inside, Leo sat still, his eyes locked on something in the distance.  
  
""Leo, what are you looking at?"" Beside him, a little girl with twin pigtails leaned over, following his gaze.  
  
A woman was kneeling on the pavement, holding her daughter, whispering to her softly, not wanting to say goodbye.  
  
The little girl blinked and hesitated before asking, ""Are you thinking about your mommy?""  
  
At the mention of ""mommy,"" something inside Leo snapped. His expression darkened, his eyes turning cold and harsh. ""Don't talk about that woman! She doesn't deserve to be my mom! She's the last person on earth that I'd miss!""  
  
The little girl flinched at his sudden outburst, but after a brief pause, she tried to offer some comfort. ""You're right, Leo. A bad woman like that doesn't deserve to be your mom.""  
  
She glanced at him, then added cautiously, ""Leo, when Aunt Hazel marries Mr. Cruz, you'll have a new mommy! Aunt Hazel loves you so much—soon, she'll be your real mom!""  
  
Her words seemed to calm Leo, his angry expression softening.  
  
*Yes. Everything will be better when Hazel becomes my real mother.*



**Chapter 4 Mixed-up Heiresses**



Raelyn struggled to pull herself away from Naomi, but after a few moments, she managed to do so and rushed to the temporary studio she had rented in Amberville.  
  
As soon as she walked in, her assistant, Daphne, had some upsetting news.  
  
""Ms. Cloudnine, the director just messaged me. The lead actress for the film is confirmed ... It's Zella Quinn.  
  
Raelyn's brow furrowed. ""That's impossible! We had a clear discussion about this before signing the contract!""  
  
As the screenwriter, Raelyn wasn't involved in the casting decisions. But there was one rule she had always stuck to—Zella was never allowed to play any role in her films.  
  
This wasn't just about this movie—Raelyn had enforced this rule for every project she worked on. Any production company she collaborated with knew this was a non-negotiable condition.  
  
""Tell them to change it right now! No Zella!""  
  
""It might be a bit late for that ... "" Daphne said, holding up a tablet and showing Raelyn a post on Twitter. ""The production team already announced it.""  
  
Raelyn wasted no time and immediately called the director, Orion Marche.  
  
At first, he hung up, but after a few moments, he reluctantly answered. ""How are you doing, Ms. Cloudnine?""  
  
""Not well! Mr. Marche, I cannot accept Zella being in this film. We already talked about this!""  
  
Orion responded defensively with an awkward laugh, ""Well, yes, but you made it sound like it was just a discussion. A verbal agreement can't hold up.""  
  
Raelyn could no longer hold back her frustration and let out a bitter laugh. ""Mr. Marche, if you keep saying things like that, don't blame me when I lose my temper.""  
  
""Please, please, no need to get angry!"" Orion sighed deeply. ""I really have no choice. If I could change it, I wouldn't have cast Zella as the lead. But I can't fight the investors. They demanded Zella, or they'll pull out the funding. And if that happens, they'll blacklist me from the entire industry.""  
  
""What?"" Raelyn froze. She had dealt with investors influencing casting before, but this was something new.  
  
*How could a well-known director like Mr. Marche be so easily blacklisted?*  
  
*The production company's investors don't seem to hold that kind of power.*  
  
""Which investors?"" Raelyn asked, thinking she might be able to talk to them directly.  
  
""It's not just one investor ... It's all of them. Every single one of them is united in wanting Zella as the lead.""  
  
Raelyn gasped. *All of them?*  
  
Orion sighed again. ""Ms. Cloudnine, I’m sure you’ve figured it out. Zella has a very powerful backer. All the investors are following this mysterious figure’s orders. Please, for my sake, just let this one go.""  
  
Raelyn didn't press any further. She understood this was a situation beyond Orion's control.  
  
""Ms. Cloudnine, what’s the deal with Zella? How could she have such a powerful backer?"" Daphne asked, still confused.  
  
Zella was a low-tier actress, typically cast in minor roles for obscure web series. For a top-tier production like this, she shouldn't even have been on the radar.  
  
Raelyn paused, deep in thought. The Quinns she knew didn't have that kind of influence.  
  
""Are we really just going to let this happen? Are we really letting Zella be the lead?"" Daphne asked, clearly not willing to accept it. Raelyn's works were always known for their high standards, with leads that were either major stars or extremely talented actors.  
  
Now, a no-name actress like Zella was getting the leading role. This spoiled fish was sure to ruin the whole pot.  
  
""No way.""  
  
Raelyn didn't want to let this go, but for now, she had no solution. She couldn't risk Orion being blacklisted across the entire industry.  
  
""By the way, Ms. Cloudnine, I’ve always wondered—why do you dislike Zella so much? With her talent, she might not be able to handle the main roles, but minor ones wouldn’t be a problem. Yet you won’t even allow her to play those.""  
  
Raelyn slumped into the sofa, her exhaustion showing. ""Zella's foster parents are my biological parents.""  
  
Daphne's eyes widened in shock. ""What? Is this a case of mixed-up heiresses like in the novels?""  
  
Raelyn offered a wry smile. She hated being tangled in such a tired and worn-out trope, but it was the truth.  
  
She had been separated from her family as a child and didn't return to the Quinns until 15 years later.  
  
By then, Zella had already been living with the Quinns as their daughter for 14 years.  
  
As with many of these stories with babies switched at birth, the ties from those 14 years made it impossible for Raelyn's biological parents to welcome her back. Instead, they had already accepted Zella as their real daughter. No one in the family was happy about her return—on the contrary, they all wished she had never come back.  
  
After a heated argument, Raelyn had severed all ties with the family.  
  
It was then that she met Cruz, the man who had promised to give her a home.  
  
...  
  
At the Quinns' villa.  
  
Zella grinned happily at the official tweet from the production company. Then she liked it and retweeted it.  
  
""Mom, this is incredible! I'm finally going to be the lead in this film! Once it's finished, I'm sure I'll become a huge star!"" Zella snuggled up to a middle-aged woman sitting next to her.  
  
Juliet Quinn held Zella in her arms, her face glowing with pride. ""This is truly amazing!""  
  
""But I still don’t get it,"" Zella continued, rolling her eyes with a smirk. ""It feels like Cloudnine has something against me. I can’t even get a minor role in any of her films."" She shrugged carelessly. ""But who cares? In this one, I’m the main character!""  
  
Juliet softly combed her fingers through Zella's smooth hair, her smile growing wider. ""Speaking of which, you owe your role to Mr. Mitchell. I always said he's been so generous to our family. Once you asked, I knew he'd help you.""  
  
Zella's face flushed slightly as she thought about the charming man, and her voice softened. ""Mr. Mitchell has been so kind to me.""  
  
Three months ago, a man who claimed to be Mr. Mitchell's assistant had approached Zella. He asked about her connection with the Quinns and handed her a business card, saying she could contact him if she ever needed any assistance.  
  
In the three months since, thanks to that person's connections, Zella had gained a wealth of opportunities.  
  
It wasn't just Zella—her family's business had also benefited from this mysterious Mr. Mitchell's attention during this time.  
  
""Too bad he's getting married."" Juliet sighed as she looked at her beautiful daughter. Mr. Mitchell's fiancée can never compare to Zella. But unfortunately, the couple is set to get married soon.  
  
Zella didn't seem phased. ""I've seen enough of those high-society marriages. After the wedding, they all go their separate ways. It's so typical. As long as Mr. Mitchell treats me well, I don't care about the title.  
  
""Besides, who knows what those gossip tabloids say? Mr. Mitchell hasn't confirmed anything officially.""  
  
""True."" Juliet agreed, nodding. ""If he wasn't interested in you, why would he be so generous to you and the Quinns? Still ... "" She paused, then sighed with longing. ""It's just not very proper for you to be with him without a title.""  
  
""Speaking of proper ... "" Zella sat up straighter. ""Mr. Mitchell has a son, right? I heard he's from his ex-wife. I wonder ... what kind of woman would leave a man like Mr. Mitchell? I bet she's somewhere regretting her decision.""  
  
Juliet chuckled darkly. ""Some people are just made to suffer. Just like Raelyn, that twisted brat. She deserves to live a lonely, miserable life.""  
  
At the mention of Raelyn, Zella's expression briefly faltered. ""Mom, don't be mad at Raelyn anymore. It's all my fault. I stole her identity. I was so reckless back then; that was why she ran away out of anger and hasn't even tried to come back and see us all these years—""  
  
""Don't bring her up when we're celebrating.""  
  
Juliet cut Zella off, taking her hand gently. ""We have you, and that's more than enough. By the way, Mr. Mitchell did a huge favor for you, so you really should thank him properly. It would be best to invite him over for dinner at our place.""

**Chapter 5 Raelyn Has No Effect on Me**



In the CEO's office at Dawnridge Corporation, Cruz slammed a stack of documents onto the floor with cold, unforgiving force.  
  
His secretary quickly recoiled, bending down to gather the scattered papers. ""I'll go tell Mr. Garraway to have them redone right away ... ""  
  
She didn't waste any time and hurried out of the room, practically fleeing as if she feared for her life.  
  
Cruz's assistant, Sean Keller, who had been standing by the door, helped her shut it before turning his attention to Cruz. The latter stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his brow furrowed as he stared out—an imposing figure.  
  
""Mr. Mitchell, that's the 16th proposal you've thrown today. Sixteen. Do none of them meet your standards?""  
  
Cruz tugged irritably at his tie. ""What exactly are you trying to say?""  
  
""Is it because she's back? Is that really bothering you this much?""  
  
""Raelyn has no effect on me,"" Cruz replied flatly, not missing a beat.  
  
Sean took a step closer, his voice lowering to a quieter tone. ""I didn't say it was Raelyn.""  
  
Cruz froze for a moment, then glanced at Sean before yanking his tie off in frustration and tossing it aside. ""Are you here for a reason? If not, leave.""  
  
""There is something,"" Sean quickly responded, standing tall. ""I've followed your instructions and pressured the investors. Ms. Zella has secured the lead role in that film.""  
  
""Good.""  
  
Cruz nodded, his attention shifting back to his desk as his calm demeanor returned.  
  
Sean turned to leave but paused, then walked back toward Cruz.  
  
""Cruz, you're doing all this for the Quinns because of Raelyn, right?""  
  
It was only recently that Sean had learned the Quinns were Raelyn's family.  
  
""You're overthinking it,"" Cruz said dismissively. ""Quinn Enterprise is a business partner of Dawnridge Corporation.""  
  
""Cruz, no matter what your reasons are for helping the Quinns, remember this: You and Raelyn are divorced. She walked away from you so decisively before, even abandoning her son. Now she's back—who knows what her real intentions are?""  
  
Sean had known Cruz since high school and had been by his side ever since.  
  
The competition to inherit the Mitchells' fortune had always been fierce, and the expectations were high.  
  
Naturally, Cruz stood out among them.  
  
He had started his own business while still in high school, and by the time he entered college, his company was already flourishing.  
  
By his second year, his business had expanded internationally.  
  
It wasn't long before he was seen as the heir to the Mitchell family, taking the reins of the entire Dawnridge Corporation.  
  
Sean had been hired as Cruz's special assistant at Dawnridge.  
  
Their relationship, therefore, went beyond that of employer and employee.  
  
""And Hazel is a nice woman. Over the past few years—""  
  
""Sean, I'll say it again. There's nothing between me and Hazel. I consider her like a sister, just like Yvette,"" Cruz interrupted, casually tossing his phone onto the desk.  
  
It was a message from his sister, Yvette Mitchell, showing a new tabloid headline featuring him and Hazel.  
  
""Contact the PR department and have them clean up these ridiculous rumors.""  
  
...  
  
It was Naomi's first day at kindergarten, and she was feeling completely disheartened. It was her first full day away from Raelyn and Bethany, and she missed them terribly.  
  
She wanted to cry, but Raelyn had told her that she was a strong, big girl now and needed to hold back her tears. If she cried, the other kids might make fun of her.  
  
*I have to be strong!*  
  
*But ... I miss Mommy and Bethany so much.*  
  
While the other kids played happily, Naomi had no interest in joining them. All she wanted was to be with her family again.  
  
Then, suddenly, her tears stopped. Her big, round eyes locked onto something in the distance.  
  
It was the playground for the elementary school students.  
  
""Bro ... ""  
  
...  
  
During P.E. class in first grade, Leo was busy playing with a ball when, out of nowhere, someone grabbed the back of his shirt.  
  
He turned around and found Naomi standing there, her wide eyes blinking with innocence, her face breaking into a mischievous grin.  
  
""Who are you? Why are you grabbing my shirt?""  
  
Leo wasn't really a fan of playing with girls. The only girl he ever interacted with was Mia Winslow, Hazel's niece, and that was only because Hazel had asked him to keep an eye on her.  
  
But for some reason, he didn't mind the bold little girl in front of him.  
  
""Brother, I’m Naomi!"" Naomi announced, beaming with excitement.  
  
""Brother?"" Leo scratched his head, a confused look crossing his face. ""I'm not your brother. You've got the wrong person.""  
  
""No, I haven't! I know what you look like; I can't be wrong!""  
  
Naomi remembered seeing a portrait of Leo in Raelyn's art studio.  
  
She had asked Raelyn who the person in the painting was, and she had told her it was her brother. Naomi knew she couldn't be mistaken!  
  
Even though the brother in the painting looked younger, his face hadn't changed. It had to be him!

I’m kinda journaling here but like, with the hope for feedback and encouragement. Been working a lot recently, changing jobs so I’m exiting the old one as I train at the new one. Also still trying to get settled into a new apartment in a new city I’ve only been in for a couple months. I have sooooo much to do. I’m behind on everyday life stuff like dishes and laundry, my bedsheets need washing, the whole apartment needs dusted and swept.

I have a clawfoot tub and got a new shower rod for it (the one that was here when I moved in was ridiculously small), but putting it together is a *whole major task,* and I’ve been putting it off for literally 6 weeks. Ladies that means I have been “showering” while sitting down in my tub using the shower hose so I don’t splash water all over the room. And I haven’t properly used the tub because the bathroom was filthy when I moved in, and I simply haven’t had the time or spoons to scrub it like I need to in order for it to be up to my standards. Which is another thing I need to do.

My kitchen sitch isn’t too bad but needs some improvement, like I only have two oddly placed outlets so I need to run some extension cords and get my everyday appliances (coffee grinder, blender, etc) in a more readily usable arrangement so I’m not running around like crazy trying to do every little mundane task. Speaking of which/for example my bathroom doesn’t have any outlets at all, so I’ve been drying my hair in the kitchen, because the room that I’m going to turn into my dressing room is currently being used as storage for the shit I have yet to unpack. I don’t have any rhythm to my days because everything is just scattered everywhere. 

I finally unpacked my books today but I’m frustrated because I feel like they multiplied whilst in their boxes, which of course isn’t a bad thing because give me *all* the books but my apartment is small and my bookshelf feels like it’s holding half of what it used to? Like where the hell did I have them before lol. So I’m mostly done with that task but they feel messy and it just doesn’t feel as finished and polished as I want. I was hoping the sense of accomplishment from that would motivate me to wake up early tomorrow and dive in, but it was super anticlimactic and I’m not thrilled with how it looks so I’m just like—meh.

I have a huge pile of broken down boxes that I don’t want to throw away bc they were expensive and I would like to keep them until my next move, but I don’t know how to pack them away and protect them while I’m living here, so they’re just sitting in the dressing room/current storage room. I have access to an attic so I did think about putting them up there. But I’m afraid if I don’t put thought into how I’m storing them, once they’re up there I won’t ever look at them again until I move in a couple years and realize they’re somehow ruined. 

There’s tools and paint cans and just… crap everywhere. I have so much shit. I’ve really pared it down bc I’ve moved a lot in the past few years so I don’t have too much I would get rid of, if anything, but goddamn it’s tough to deal with when it isn’t organized. 

I posted about this once before with a photo of my kitchen and then posted an after. You guys are always so supportive and lovely. Tuesday is my birthday and I have some friends coming into town who will be seeing my place, so I’d like to feel a little more settled in by then. It doesn’t need to feel “finished” (literally impossible to get to that point by then) but it would be nice if it wasn’t chaotic. I have tomorrow and Monday to work. I’m concerned that I’m going to end up shutting down and pulling my blanket over my head because I’m so overwhelmed. My hours at work have been crazy and every dish in my house is dirty… how the hell am I going to wash every dish in my house, build a shower rod (i literally have to cut metal pipes with a hacksaw), do laundry, dust, sweep, mop, unpack boxes, and remain human through all of it?! And not collapse into a puddle of overwhelmed disassociation?!

Gas me up here, girls. For tomorrow I must slay.

Hey y’all so I worked at SBux in 2018 through 2021, a little over 3 years. I left in 2021, worked a couple other jobs, then worked at a licensed store for 8 months in 2024. I came back to corporate SBux in August, and I was told I had to wait until I had been back with the company for 6 months to be promoted to a shift supervisor, even though I was a trainer in 2021 and at the licensed store, and I had already been partially trained to be a shift in 2021 before I left (long story).

I originally had no problem with this, as it seemed reasonable. That being said, a new partner at my store is currently being trained, and she is now boasting that she’s going to be a shift supervisor once she finishes training, despite having never worked for Starbucks before. This has been confirmed by other SSVs and the ASM.

She has already tried to “steal” product by attempting to make drinks she didn’t ring in (the first time, understandable, she’s new, the second time is inexcusable because she had been coached on it). She’s also trying to tell other people how to do their jobs, despite being wrong, and is ignoring her trainer to float around and make drinks/do tasks that she ISN’T trained on, and is doing it wrong (e.i., put ice in before iced coffee, putting ice before milk and then adding syrup and espresso for lattes, attempting to make backups she doesn’t know yet). When her trainer talked to the ASM about it, they were told to “let them know if it got worse” and they didn’t do anything about it.

Another partner who worked at Starbucks for like 4 years previously (also leaving and coming back within the last 4 years) and WAS a shift got passed over for the promotion in favor of this new girl.

Was I lied to about the rules for being a shift? Has the policy changed? Or did our ASM break the rules for this person? I’m genuinely asking here because I don’t want to make a claim without any basis, and I can’t find the standard for shift promotions anywhere, so I figured I’d ask here.

If she was hired to be a shift genuinely, without breaking any rules, I don’t think she’ll last long due to the fact that my store has already fired people for “stealing” product (not ringing up drinks, giving their discount/mark outs to nonpartners). If she was hired as a shift against standards, what should I do?

TL;DR: a new girl got hired a shift with no SBux experience after another SBux partner and I with years of experience were told we had to wait before we could be promoted, is this against the rules?",2,1749784427.0,starbucks,4,1.0,False
1la5pel,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1la5pel/caffeine_sensitive_adderall_xr_and_wellbutrin/,"Caffeine sensitive, Adderall XR, and Wellbutrin","Just wanna share my experience so far at 2 months of Adderall. I usually drink 1 cup of black tea each morning, but I think I've quit that, as of 3 days ago.

1 month on 10mg - didn't see much of a difference in managing my ADHD. I saw a bit of an increase in my anxiety, which I expected, bc I'm prone to that with any stimulants, including caffeine. Next month, we upped the Adderall XR to 20mg. Came with more energy, and unsurprisingly, more anxiety. I felt like Scooby Doo at work - anxious and scaredy-faced/scaredy-voiced about everything, many times when I'd hear myself respond to my boss about one thing or another. Even good things, like winning a big scholarship for grad school.

In a move to hopefully reduce anxiety and what is not necessary, I asked for my Wellbutrin to be lowered back to 150mg after being on 300mg for over a year. 2 weeks into this, I'm happy about this decision. No drop in mood. 

To further reduce anxiety, I skipped my daily morning caffeine these last 3 days. No coffee, black tea, or any kind of caffeine to start the day. Just the Adderall XR, water, and breakfast.

I must say - I feel calmer!! Alert/awake enough. Energetic but present. Not spiraling into anxiety as I have been prone to do. Not sounding and feeling like Scooby Doo. I'm shrugging off things that I am actually anxious about deep down if I were to actually think about it too much, but it seems I have more of my control back - able to turn away from unnecessarily descending into the toxic anxiety lava pit when I know I should. 

So yeah!! I'm feeling optimistic and wanted to share a positive story for anyone wondering or going through similar adjustment things. :) And yes, my focus has been better/more sustained on Adderall than without it, though it's not a magic fix-all pill. I still have to find motivation myself and practice prioritization myself. ",5,1749784384.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Down at the Ford place in Clanton he was known as the last man in recent history to pay cash for a new pickup truck. Sixteen thousand cash, for a custom-built, four-wheel drive..........","**Chapter One**  
Billy Ray Cobb was the younger and smaller of the two rednecks. At twenty-three he was already a three-year veteran of the state penitentiary at Parchman. Possession, with intent to sell. He was a lean, tough little punk who had survived prison by somehow maintaining a ready supply of drugs that he sold and sometimes gave to the blacks and the guards for protection. In the year since his release he had continued to prosper, and his small-time narcotics business had elevated him to the position of one of the more affluent rednecks in Ford County. He was a businessman, with employees, obligations, deals, everything but taxes. Down at the Ford place in Clanton he was known as the last man in recent history to pay cash for a new pickup truck. Sixteen thousand cash, for a custom-built, four-wheel drive, canary yellow, luxury Ford pickup. The fancy chrome wheels and mudgrip racing tires had been received in a business deal. The rebel flag hanging across the rear window had been stolen by Cobb from a drunken fraternity boy at an Ole Miss football game. The pickup was Billy Ray's most prized possession. He sat on the tailgate drinking a beer, smoking a joint, watching his friend Willard take his turn with the black girl.  
  Willard was four years older and a dozen years slower. He was generally a harmless sort who had never been in serious trouble and had never been seriously employed. Maybe an occasional fight with a night in jail, but nothing that would distinguish him. He called himself a pulpwood cutter, but a bad back customarily kept him out of the woods. He had hurt his back working on an offshore rig somewhere in the Gulf, and the oil company paid him a nice settlement, which he lost when his ex-wife cleaned him out. His primary vocation was that of a part-time employee of Billy Ray Cobb, who didn't pay much but was liberal with his dope. For the first time in years Willard could always get his hands on something. And he always needed something. He'd been that way since he hurt his back.  
  
  She was ten, and small for her age. She lay on her elbows, which were stuck and bound together with yellow nylon rope. Her legs were spread grotesquely with the right foot tied tight to an oak sapling and the left to a rotting, leaning post of a long-neglected fence. The ski rope had cut into her ankles and the blood ran down her legs. Her face was bloody and swollen, with one eye bulging and closed and the other eye half open so she could see the other white man sitting on the truck. She did not look at the man on top of her. He was breathing hard and sweating and cursing. He was hurting her.  
  
  When he finished, he slapped her and laughed, and the other man laughed in return, then they laughed harder and rolled around the grass by the truck like two crazy men, screaming and laughing. She turned away from them and cried softly, careful to keep herself quiet. She had been slapped earlier for crying and screaming. They promised to kill her if she didn't keep quiet.  
  
  They grew tired of laughing and pulled themselves onto the tailgate, where Willard cleaned himself with the little nigger's shirt, which by now was soaked with blood and sweat. Cobb handed him a cold beer from the cooler and commented on the humidity. They watched her as she sobbed and made strange, quiet sounds, then became still. Cobb's beer was half empty, and it was not cold anymore. He threw it at the girl. It hit her in the stomach, splashing white foam, and it rolled off in the dirt near some other cans, all of which had originated from the same cooler. For two six-packs now they had thrown their half-empty cans at her and laughed. Willard had trouble with the target, but Cobb was fairly accurate. They were not ones to waste beer, but the heavier cans could be felt better and it was great fun to watch the foam shoot everywhere.  
  
  The warm beer mixed with the dark blood and ran down her face and neck into a puddle behind her head. She did not move.  
  
  Willard asked Cobb if he thought she was dead. Cobb opened another beer and explained that she was not dead because niggers generally could not be killed by kicking and beating and raping. It took much more, something like a knife or a gun or a rope to dispose of a nigger. Although he had never taken part in such a killing, he had lived with a bunch of niggers in prison and knew all about them. They were always killing each other, and they always used a weapon of some sort. Those who were just beaten and raped never died. Some of the whites were beaten and raped, and some of them died. But none of the niggers. Their heads were harder. Willard seemed satisfied.  
  
  Willard asked what he planned to do now that they were through with her. Cobb sucked on his joint, chased it with beer, and said he wasn't through. He bounced from the tailgate and staggered across the small clearing to where she was tied. He cursed her and screamed at her to wake up, then he poured cold beer in her face, laughing like a crazy man.  
  
  She watched him as he walked around the tree on her right side, and she stared at him as he stared between her legs. When he lowered his pants she turned to the left and closed her eyes. He was hurting her again.  
  
  She looked out through the woods and saw something -a man running wildly through the vines and underbrush. It was her daddy, yelling and pointing at her and coming desperately to save her. She cried out for him, and he disappeared. She fell asleep.  
  
  When she awoke one of the men was lying under the tailgate, the other under a tree. They were asleep. Her arms and legs were numb. The blood and beer and urine had mixed with the dirt underneath her to form a sticky paste that glued her small body to the ground and crackled when she moved and wiggled. Escape, she thought, but her mightiest efforts moved her only a few inches to the right. Her feet were tied so high her buttocks barely touched the ground. Her legs and arms were so deadened they refused to move.  
  
  She searched the woods for her daddy and quietly called his name. She waited, then slept again.  
  
  When she awoke the second time they were up and moving around. The tall one staggered to her with a small knife. He grabbed her left ankle and sawed furiously on the rope until it gave way. Then he freed the right leg, and she curled into a fetal position with her back to them.  
  
  Cobb strung a length of quarter-inch ski rope over a limb and tied a loop in one end with a slip knot. He grabbed her and put the noose around her head, then walked across the clearing with the other end of the rope and sat on the tailgate, where Willard was smoking a fresh joint and grinning at Cobb for what he was about to do. Cobb pulled the rope tight, then gave a vicious yank, bouncing the little nude body along the ground and stopping it directly under the limb. She gagged and coughed, so he kindly loosened the rope to spare her a few more minutes. He tied the rope to the bumper and opened another beer.  
  
  They sat on the tailgate drinking, smoking, and staring at her. They had been at the lake most of the day, where Cobb had a friend with a boat and some extra girls who were supposed to be easy but turned out to be untouchable. Cobb had been generous with his drugs and beer, but the girls did not reciprocate. Frustrated, they left the lake and were driving to no place in particular when they happened across the girl. She was walking along a gravel road with a sack of groceries when Willard nailed her in the back of the head with a beer can.  
  
  ""You gonna do it?"" asked Willard, his eyes red and glazed.  
  
  Cobb hesitated. ""Naw, I'll let you do it. It was your idea. ""  
  
  Willard took a drag on his joint, then spit and said, ""Wasn't my idea. You're the expert on killin' niggers. Do it. ""  
  
  Cobb untied the rope from the bumper and pulled it tight. It peeled bark from the limb and sprinkled fine bits of elm around the girl, who was watching them carefully now. She coughed.  
  
  Suddenly, she heard something-like a car with loud pipes. The two men turned quickly and looked down the dirt road to the highway in the distance. They cursed and scrambled around, one slamming the tailgate and the other running toward her. He tripped and landed near her. They cursed each other while they grabbed her, removed the rope from her neck, dragged her to the pickup and threw her  
over the tailgate into the bed of the truck. Cobb slapped her and threatened to kill her if she did not lie still and keep quiet. He said he would take her home if she stayed down and did as told; otherwise, they would kill her. They slammed the doors and sped onto the dirt road. She was going home. She passed out.  
  
  Cobb and Willard waved at the Firebird with the loud pipes as it passed them on the narrow dirt road. Willard checked the back to make sure the little nigger was lying down. Cobb turned onto the highway and raced away.  
  
  ""What now?"" Willard asked nervously.  
  
  ""Don't know,"" Cobb answered nervously. ""But we gotta do something fast before she gets blood all over my truck. Look at her back there, she's bleedin' all over the place. ""  
  
  Willard thought for a minute while he finished a beer. ""Let's throw her off a bridge,"" he said proudly.  
  
  ""Good idea. Damned good idea. "" Cobb slammed on the brakes. ""Gimme a beer,"" he ordered Willard, who stumbled out of the truck and fetched two beers from the back.  
  
  ""She's even got blood on the cooler,"" he reported as they raced off again.  
  
  Gwen Hailey sensed something horrible. Normally she would have sent one of the three boys to the store, but they were being punished by their father and had been sentenced to weed-pulling in the garden. Tonya had been to the store before by herself-it was only a mile away-and had proven reliable. But after two hours Gwen sent the boys to look for their little sister. They figured she was down at the Pounders' house playing with the many Pounders kids, or maybe she had ventured past the store to visit her best friend, Bessie Pierson.  
  
  Mr. Bates at the store said she had come and gone an hour earlier. Jarvis, the middle boy, found a sack of groceries beside the road.  
  
  Gwen called her husband at the paper mill, then loaded Carl Lee, Jr. , into the car and began driving the gravel roads around the store. They drove to a settlement of ancient shotgun houses on Graham Plantation to check with an aunt. They stopped at Broadway's store a mile from Bates Grocery and were told by a group of old black men that she had not been seen. They crisscrossed the gravel roads and dusty field roads for three square miles around their house.  
  
  Cobb could not find a bridge unoccupied by niggers with fishing poles. Every bridge they approached had four or five niggers hanging off the sides with large straw hats and cane poles, and under every bridge on the banks there would be another group sitting on buckets with the same straw hats and cane poles, motionless except for an occasional swat at a fly or a slap at a mosquito.  
  
  He was scared now. Willard had passed out and was of no help, and he was left alone to dispose of the girl in such a way that she could never tell. Willard snored as he frantically drove the gravel roads and county roads in search of a bridge or ramp on some river where he could stop and toss her without being seen by half a dozen niggers with straw hats. He looked in the mirror and saw her trying to stand. He slammed his brakes, and she crashed into the front of the bed, just under the window. Willard ricocheted off the dash into the floorboard, where he continued to snore. Cobb cursed them both equally.  
  
  Lake Chatulla was nothing more than a huge, shallow, man-made mudhole with a grass-covered dam running exactly one mile along one end. It sat in the far southwest corner of Ford County, with a few acres in Van Buren County. In the spring it would hold the distinction of being the largest body of water in Mississippi. But by late summer the rains were long gone, and the sun would cook the shallow water until the lake would dehydrate. Its once ambitious shorelines would retreat and move much closer together, creating a depthless basin of reddish brown water. It was fed from all directions by innumerable streams, creeks, sloughs, and a couple of currents large enough to be named rivers. The existence of all these tributaries necessarily gave rise to a good number of bridges near the lake.  
  
  It was over these bridges the yellow pickup flew in an all-out effort to find a suitable place to unload an unwanted passenger. Cobb was desperate. He knew of one other bridge, a narrow wooden one over Foggy Creek. As he approached, he saw niggers with cane poles, so he turned off a side road and stopped the truck. He lowered the tailgate, dragged her out, and threw her in a small ravine lined with kudzu.  
  
  Carl Lee Hailey did not hurry home. Gwen was easily excited, and she had called the mill numerous times when she thought the children had been kidnapped. He punched out at quitting time, and made the thirty-minute drive home in thirty minutes. Anxiety hit him when he turned onto his gravel drive and saw the patrol car parked next to the front porch. Other cars belonging to Owen's family were scattered along the long drive and in the yard, and there was one car he didn't recognize. It had cane poles sticking out the side windows, and there were at least seven straw hats sitting in it.  
  
  Where were Tonya and the boys?  
  
  As he opened the front door he heard Gwen crying. To his right in the small living room he found a crowd huddled above a small figure lying on the couch. The child was covered with wet towels and surrounded by crying relatives. As he moved to the couch the crying stopped and the crowd backed away. Only Gwen stayed by the girl. She softly stroked her hair. He knelt beside the couch and touched the girl's shoulder. He spoke to his daughter, and she tried to smile. Her face was bloody pulp covered with knots and lacerations. Both eyes were swollen shut and bleeding. His eyes watered as he looked at her tiny body, completely wrapped in towels and bleeding from ankles to forehead.  
  
  Carl Lee asked Gwen what happened. She began shaking and wailing, and was led to the kitchen by her brother. Carl Lee stood and turned to the crowd and demanded to know what happened.  
  
  Silence.  
  
  He asked for the third time. The deputy, Willie Hastings, one of Gwen's cousins, stepped forward and told Carl Lee that some people were fishing down by Foggy Creek when they saw Tonya lying in the middle of the road. She told them her daddy's name, and they brought her home.  
  
  Hastings shut up and stared at his feet.  
  
  Carl Lee stared at him and waited. Everyone else stopped breathing and watched the floor.  
  
  ""What happened, Willie?"" Carl Lee yelled as he stared at the deputy.  
  
  Hastings spoke slowly, and while staring out the window repeated what Tonya had told her mother about the white men and their pickup, and the rope and the trees, and being hurt when they got on her. -Hastings stopped when he heard the siren from the ambulance.  
  
  The crowd filed solemnly through the front door and waited on the porch, where they watched the crew unload a stretcher and head for the house.  
  
  The paramedics stopped in the yard when the front door opened and Carl Lee walked out with his daughter in his arms. He whispered gently to her as huge tears dripped from his chin. He walked to the rear of the ambulance and stepped inside. The paramedics closed the door and carefully removed her from his embrace.  
  
  Ozzie Walls was the only black sheriff in Mississippi. There had been a few others in recent history, but for the moment he was the only one. He took great pride in that fact, since Ford County was seventy-four percent white and the other black sheriffs had been from much blacker counties. Not since Reconstruction had a black sheriff been elected in a white county in Mississippi.  
  
  He was raised in Ford County, and he was kin to most of the blacks and a few of the whites. After desegregation in the late sixties, he was a member of the first mixed graduating class at Clanton High School. He wanted to play football nearby at Ole Miss, but there were already two blacks on the team. He starred instead at Alcorn State, and was a defensive tackle for the Rams when a knee injury sent him back to Clanton. He missed football, but enjoyed being the high sheriff, especially at election time when he received more . white votes than his white opponents. The white kids loved him because he was a hero, a football star who had played on TV and had his picture in magazines. Their parents respected him and voted for him because he was a tough cop who did not discriminate between black punks and white  
  
  Sunks. The white politicians supported him because, since e became the sheriff, the Justi  
ce Department stayed out of Ford County. The blacks adored him because he was Ozzie, one of their own.  
  
  He skipped supper and waited in his office at the jail for Hastings to report from the Hailey house. He had a suspect. Billy Ray Cobb was no stranger to the sheriffs office. Ozzie knew he sold drugs-he just couldn't catch him. He also knew Cobb had a mean streak.  
  
  The dispatcher called in the deputies, and as they reported to the jail Ozzie gave them instructions to locate, but not arrest, Billy Ray Cobb. There were twelve deputies in all -nine white and three black. They fanned out across the county in search of a fancy yellow Ford pickup with a rebel flag in the rear window.  
  
  When Hastings arrived he and the sheriff left for the Ford County hospital. As usual, Hastings drove and Ozzie gave orders on the radio. In the waiting room on the second floor they found the Hailey clan. Aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, and strangers crowded into the small room and some waited in the narrow hallway. There were whispers and quiet tears. Tonya was in surgery.  
  
  Carl Lee sat on a cheap plastic couch in a dark corner with Gwen next to him and the boys next to her. He stared at the floor and did not notice the crowd. Gwen laid her head on his shoulder and cried softly. The boys sat rigidly with their hands on knees, occasionally glancing at their father as if waiting on words of reassurance.  
  
  Ozzie worked his way through the crowd, quietly shaking hands and patting backs and whispering that he would catch them. He knelt before Carl Lee and Gwen. ""How is she?"" he asked. Carl Lee did not see him. Gwen cried louder and the boys sniffed and wiped tears. He patted Gwen on the knee and stood. One of her brothers led Ozzie and Hastings out of the room into the hall, away from the family. He shook Ozzie's hand and thanked him for coming.  
  
  ""How is she?"" Ozzie asked.  
  
  ""Not too good. She's in surgery and most likely will be there for a while. She's got broken fjones and a bad concussion. She's beat up real bad. There's rope burns on her neck like they tried to hang her. ""  
  
  ""Was she raped?"" he asked, certain of the answer.  
  
  ""Yeah. She told her momma they took turns on her and hurt her real bad. Doctors confirmed it. ""  
  
  ""How's Carl Lee and Gwen?""  
  
  ""They're tore up pretty bad. I think they're in shock. Carl Lee ain't said a word since he got here. ""  
  
  JDzzie assured him they would find the two men, and it wouldn't take long, and when they found them they would be locked up someplace safe. The brother suggested he should hide them in another jail, for their own safety.  
  
  Three miles out of Clanton, Ozzie pointed to a gravel driveway. ""Pull in there,"" he told Hastings, who turned off the highway and drove into the front yard of a dilapidated house trailer. It was almost dark.  
  
  Ozzie took his night stick and banged violently on the front door. ""Open up, Bumpous!""  
  
  The trailer shook and Bumpous scrambled to the bathroom to flush a fresh joint.  
  
  ""Open up, Bumpous!"" Ozzie banged. ""I know you're in there. Open up or I'll kick in the door. ""  
  
  Bumpous yanked the door open and Ozzie walked in. ""You know, Bumpous, evertime I visit you I smell somethin' funny and the commode's flushin'. Get some clothes on. I gotta job for you. ""  
  
  ""W-what?""  
  
  ""I'll explain it outside where I can breathe. Just get some clothes on and hurry. ""  
  
  ""What if I don't want to?""  
  
  ""Fine. I'll see your parole officer tomorrow. ""  
  
  ""I'll be out in a minute. ""  
  
  Ozzie smiled and walked to his car. Bobby Bumpous was one of his favorites. Since his parole two years earlier, he had led a reasonably clean life, occasionally succumbing to the lure of an easy drug sale for a quick buck. Ozzie watched him like a hawk and knew of such transactions, and Bumpous knew Ozzie knew; therefore, Bumpous was usually most eager to help his friend, Sheriff Walls. The plan was to eventually use Bumpous to nail Billy Ray Cobb for dealing, but that would be postponed for now.  
  
  After a few minutes he marched outside, still tucking his shirttail and zipping his pants. ""Who you lookin' for?"" he demanded.  
  
  ""Billy Ray Cobb. ""  
  
  ""That's no problem. You can find him without me. ""  
  
  ""Shut up and listen. We think Cobb was involved in a rape this afternoon. A black girl was raped by two white men, and I think Cobb was there. ""  
  
  ""Cobb ain't into rape, Sheriff. He's into drugs, remember?""  
  
  ""Shut up and listen. You find Cobb and spend some time with him. Five minutes ago his truck was spotted at Huey's. Buy him a beer. Shoot some pool, roll dice, whatever. Find out what he did today. Who was he with? Where'd he go? You know how he likes to talk, right?""  
  
  ""Right. ""  
  
  ""Call the dispatcher when you find him. They'll call me. I'll be somewhere close. You understand?""  
  
  ""Sure, Sheriff. No problem. ""  
  
  ""Any questions?""  
  
  ""Yeah. I'm broke. Who's gonna pay for this?""  
  
  Ozzie handed him a twenty and left. Hastings drove in the direction of Huey's, down by the lake.  
  
  ""You sure you can trust him?"" Hastings asked. . ""Who?""  
  
  ""That Bumpous kid. ""  
  
  ""Sure I trust him. He's proved very reliable since he was paroled. He's a good kid tryin' to go straight, for the most part. He supports his local sheriff and would do anything I ask. ""  
  
  ""Why?""  
  
  ""Because I caught him with ten ounces of pot a year ago. He'd been outta jail about a year when I caught his brother with an ounce, and I told him he was lookin' at thirty years. He started cryin' and carryin' on, cried all night in his cell. By mornin' he was ready to talk. Told me his supplier was his brother, Bobby. So I let him go and went to see Bobby. I knocked on his door and I could hear the commode flushin'. He wouldn't come to the door, so I kicked it in. I found him in his underwear in the bathroom tryin' to unstop the commode. There was dope all over the place. Don't know how much he flushed, but most of it was comin' back out in the overflow. Scared him so bad he wet his drawers. ""  
  
  ""You kiddin'?""  
  
  ""Nope. The kid pissed all over himself. He was a sight standin' there with wet drawers, a plunger in one hand, dope in the other, and the room fillin' up with commode water. ""  
  
  ""What'd you do?""  
  
  ""Threatened to kill him. ""  
  
  ""What'd he do?""  
  
  ""Started cryin'. Cried like a baby. Cried 'bout his momma and prison and all this and that. Promised he'd never screw up again. ""  
  
  ""You arrest him?""  
  
  ""Naw, I just couldn't. I talked real ugly to him and threatened him some more. I put him on probation right there in his bathroom. He's been fun to work with ever since. ""  
  
  They drove by Huey's and saw Cobb's truck in the gravel parking lot with a dozen other pickups and four-wheel drives. They parked behind a black church on a hill up the highway from Huey's, where they had a good view of the honky tonk, or tonk, as it was affectionately called by the patrons. Another patrol car hid behind some trees at the other end of the highway. Moments later Bumpous flew by and wheeled into the parking lot. He locked his brakes, spraying gravel and dust, then backed next to Cobb's truck. He looked around and casually entered Huey's. Thirty minutes later the dispatcher advised Ozzie that the informant had found the subject, a male white, at Huey's, an establishment on Highway 305 near the lake. Within minutes two more patrol cars were hidden close by. They waited.  
  
  ""What makes you so sure it's Cobb?"" Hastings asked.  
  
  ""I ain't sure. I just got a hunch. The little girl said it was a truck with shiny wheels and big tires. ""  
  
  ""That narrows it down to two thousand. ""  
  
  ""She also said it was yellow, looked new, and had a big flag hangin' in the rear window. ""  
  
  ""That brings it down to two hundred. ""  
  
  ""Maybe less than that. How many of those are as mean as Billy Ray Cobb?""  
  
  ""What if it ain't him?""  
  
  ""It is. ""  
  
  ""If it ain't?""  
  
  ""We'll know shortly. He's got a big mouth, 'specially when he's drinkin'. ""  
  
  For two hours t  
hey waited and watched pickups come and go. Truck drivers, pulpwood cutters, factory workers, and farmhands parked their pickups and jeeps in the gravel and strutted inside to drink, shoot pool, listen to the band, but mainly to look for stray women. Some would leave and walk next door to Ann's Lounge, where they would stay for a few minutes and return to Huey's. Ann's Lounge was darker both inside and out, and it lacked the colorful beer signs and live music that made Huey's such a hit with the locals. Ann's  
  
  was known for its drug traffic, whereas Huey's had it all- music, women, happy hours, poker machines, dice, dancing, and plenty of fights. One brawl spilled through the door into the parking lot, where a group of wild rednecks kicked and clawed each other at random until they grew winded and returned to the dice table.  
  
  ""Hope that wasn't Bumpous,"" observed the sheriff.  
  
  The restrooms inside were small and nasty, and most of the patrons found it necessary to relieve themselves between the pickups in the parking lot. This was especially true on Mondays when ten-cent beer night drew rednecks from four counties and every truck in the parking lot received at least three sprayings. About once a week an innocent passing motorist would get shocked by something he or she saw in the parking lot, and Ozzie would be forced to make an arrest. Otherwise, he left the places alone.  
  
  Both tonks were in violation of numerous laws. There was gambling, drugs, illegal whiskey, minors, they refused to close on time, etc. Shortly after he was elected the first time Ozzie made the mistake, due in part to a hasty campaign promise, of closing all the honky tonks in the county. It was a horrible mistake. The crime rate soared. The jail was packed. The court dockets multiplied. The rednecks united and drove in caravans to Clanton, where they parked around the courthouse on the square. Hundreds of them. Every night they invaded the square, drinking, fighting, playing loud music, and shouting obscenities at the horrified town folk. Each morning the square resembled a landfill with cans and bottles thrown everywhere. He closed the black tonks too, and break-ins, burglaries, and stabbings tripled in one month. There were two murders in one week.  
  
  Finally, with the city under siege, a group of local ministers met secretly with Ozzie and begged him to ease up on the tonks. He politely reminded them that during the campaign they had insisted on the closings. They admitted they were wrong and pleaded for relief. Yes, they would support him in the next election. Ozzie relented, and life returned to normal in Ford County.  
  
  Ozzie was not pleased that the establishments thrived in his county, but he was convinced beyond any doubt that his law-abiding constituents were much safer when the tonks were open.  
  
  At ten-thirty the dispatcher radioed that the informant was on the phone and wanted to see the sheriff. Ozzie gave his location, and a minute later they watched Bumpous emerge and stagger to his truck. He spun tires, slung gravel, and raced toward the church.  
  
  ""He's drunk,"" said Hastings.  
  
  He wheeled through the church parking lot and came to a screeching stop a few feet from the patrol car. ""Howdy, Sheriff!"" he yelled.  
  
  Ozzie walked to the pickup. ""What took so long?""  
  
  ""You told me to take all night. ""  
  
  ""You found him two hours ago. ""  
  
  ""That's true, Sheriff, but have you ever tried to spend twenty dollars on beer when it's fifty cents a can?""  
  
  ""You drunk?""  
  
  ""Naw, just havin' a good time. Could I have another twenty?""  
  
  ""What'd you find out?""  
  
  "" 'Bout what?""  
  
  ""Cobb!""  
  
  ""Oh, he's in there all right. ""  
  
  ""I know he's in there! What else?""  
  
  Bumpous quit smiling and looked at the tonk in the distance. ""He's laughin' about it, Sheriff. It's a big joke. Said he finally found a nigger who was a virgin. Somebody asked how old she was, and Cobb said eight or nine. Everybody laughed. ""  
  
  Hastings closed his eyes and dropped his head. Ozzie gritted his teeth and looked away. ""What else did he say?""  
  
  ""He's bad drunk. He won't remember any of it in the mornin'. Said she was a cute little nigger. ""  
  
  ""Who was with him?""  
  
  ""Pete Willard. ""  
  
  ""Is he in there?""  
  
  ""Yep, they're both laughin' about it. ""  
  
  ""Where are they?""  
  
  ""Left-hand side, next to the pinball machines. ""  
  
  Ozzie smiled. ""Okay, Bumpous. You did good. Get lost. ""  
  
  Hastings called the dispatcher with the two names. The dispatcher relayed the message to Deputy Looney, who was parked in the street in front of the home of County Judge Percy Bullard. Looney rang the doorbell and handed the judge two affidavits and two arrest warrants. Bullard scribbled on the warrants and returned them to Looney, who thanked His Honor and left. Twenty minutes later Looney handed the warrants to Ozzie behind the church.  
  
  At exactly eleven, the band quit in mid-song, the dice disappeared, the dancers froze, the cue balls stopped rolling, and someone turned on the lights. All eyes followed the big sheriff as he and his men swaggered slowly across the dance floor to a table by the pinball machines. Cobb, Willard, and two others sat in a booth, the table littered with empty beer cans Ozzie walked to the table and grinned at Cobb.  
  
  ""I'm sorry, sir, but we don't allow niggers in here,"" Cobb blurted out, and the four burst into laughter. Ozzie kept grinning.  
  
  When the laughing stopped, Ozzie said, ""You boys havin' a good time, Billy Ray?""  
  
  ""We was. ""  
  
  ""Looks like it. I hate to break things up, but you and Mr. Willard need to come with me. ""  
  
  ""Where we goin'?"" Willard asked.  
  
  ""For a ride. ""  
  
  ""I ain't movin',"" Cobb vowed. With that, the other two scooted from the booth and joined the spectators.  
  
  ""I'm placin' you both under arrest,"" Ozzie said.  
  
  ""You got warrants?"" Cobb asked.  
  
  Hastings produced the warrants, and Ozzie threw them among the beer cans. ""Yeah, we got warrants. Now get up. ""  
  
  Willard stared desperately at Cobb, who sipped a beer and said, ""I ain't goin' to jail. ""  
  
  Looney handed Ozzie the longest, blackest nightstick ever used in Ford County. Willard was panic-stricken. Ozzie cocked it and struck the center of the table, sending beer and cans and foam in all directions. Willard bolted upright, slapped his wrists together and thrust them at Looney, who was waiting with the handcuffs. He was dragged outside and thrown into a patrol car.  
  
  Ozzie tapped his left palm with the stick and grinned at  
  
  Cobb. ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in court. You have the right to a lawyer. If you can't afford one, the state'll furnish one. Any questions?""  
  
  ""Yeah, what time is it?""  
  
  ""Time to go to jail, big man. ""  
  
  ""Go to hell, nigger. ""  
  
  Ozzie grabbed his hair and lifted him from the booth, then drove his face into the floor. He jammed a knee into his spine and slid his nightstick under his throat, and pulled upward while driving the knee deeper into his back. Cobb squealed until the stick began crushing his larynx.  
  
  The handcuffs were slapped into place, and Ozzie dragged him by his hair across the dance floor, out the door, across the gravel and threw him into the back seat with Wil-lard.  
  
  News of the rape spread quickly. More friends and relatives crowded into the waiting room and the halls around it. Tonya was out of surgery and listed as critical. Ozzie talked to Gwen's brother in the hall and told of the arrests. Yes, they were the ones, he was sure.  
  
  Jake Brigance rolled across his wife and staggered to the small bathroom a few feet from his bed, where he searched and groped in the dark for the screaming alarm clock. He found it where he had left it, and killed it with a quick and violent slap. It was 5:30 A. M. , Wednesday, May 15.  
  
  He stood in the dark for a moment, breathless, terrified, his heart pounding rapidly, staring at the fluorescent numbers glowing at him from the face of the clock, a clock he hated. Its piercing scream could be heard down the street. He flirted with  
cardiac arrest every morning at this time when the thing erupted. On occasion, about twice a year, he was successful in shoving Carla onto the floor, and she would maybe turn it off before returning to bed. Most of the time, however, she was not sympathetic. She thought he was crazy for getting up at such an hour.  
  
  The clock sat on the windowsill so that Jake was required to move around a bit before it was silenced. Once up, Jake would not permit himself to crawl back under the covers. It was one of his rules. At one time the alarm was on the nightstand, and the volume was reduced. Carla would reach and turn it off before Jake heard anything. Then he would sleep until seven or eight and ruin his entire day. He would miss being in the office by seven, which was another rule. The alarm stayed in the bathroom and served its purpose.  
  
  Jake stepped to the sink and splashed cold water on'his face and hair. He switched on the light and gasped in horror at the sight in the mirror. His straight brown hair shot in all directions, and the hairline had receded at least two inches during the night. Either that or his forehead had grown. His eyes were matted and swollen with the white stuff packed in the corners. A seam in a blanket left a bright red scar along the left side of his face. He touched, then rubbed it and wondered if it would go away. With his right hand he pushed his hair back and inspected the hairline. At thirty-two, he had no gray hair. Gray hair was not the problem. The problem was pattern baldness, which Jake had richly inherited from both sides of his family. He longed for a full, thick hairline beginning an inch above his eyebrows. He still had plenty of hair, Carla told him. But it wouldn't last long at the rate it was disappearing. She also assured him he was as handsome as ever, and he believed her. She had explained that a receding hairline gave him a look of maturity that was essential for a young attorney. He believed that too.  
  
  But what about old, bald attorneys, or even mature, middle-aged bald attorneys? Why couldn't the hair return after he grew wrinkles and gray sideburns and looked very mature?  
  
  Jake pondered these things in the shower. He took quick showers, and he shaved and dressed quickly. He had to be at the Coffee Shop at 6:00 A. M. -another rule. He turned on lights and slammed and banged drawers and closet doors in an effort to arouse Carla. This was the morning ritual during the summer when she was not teaching school. He had explained to her numerous times that she had all day to catch up on any lost sleep, and that these early moments should be spent together. She moaned and tunneled deeper under the covers. Once dressed, Jake jumped on the bed with all fours and kissed her in the ear, down the neck, and all over the face until she finally swung at him. Then he yanked the covers off the bed and laughed as she curled up and shivered and begged for the blankets. He held them and admired her dark, tanned, thin, almost perfect legs. The bulky nightshirt covered nothing below the waist, and a hundred lewd thoughts danced before him.  
  
  About once a month this ritual would get out of hand. She would not protest, and the blankets would be jointly removed. On those mornings Jake undressed even quicker and broke at least three of his rules. That's how Hanna was conceived.  
  
  But not this morning. He covered his wife, kissed her gently, and turned out the lights. She breathed easier, and fell asleep.  
  
  Down the hall he quietly opened Hanna's door and knelt beside her. She was four, the only child, and there would be no others. She lay in her bed surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals. He kissed her lightly on the cheek. She was as beautiful as her mother, and the two were identical in looks and manners. They had large bluish-gray eyes that could cry instantly, if necessary. They wore their dark hair the same way-had it cut by the same person at the same time. They even dressed alike.  
  
  Jake adored the two women in his life. He kissed the second one goodbye and went to the kitchen to make coffee for Carla. On his way out he released Max, the mutt, into the backyard, where she simultaneously relieved herself and barked at Mrs. Pickle's cat next door.  
  
  Few people attacked the morning like Jake Brigance. He walked briskly to the end of the driveway and got the morning papers for Carla. It was dark, clear, and cool with the promise of summer rapidly approaching.  
  
  He studied the darkness up and down Adams Street, then turned and admired his house. Two homes in Ford County were on the National Register of Historic Places, and Jake Brigance owned one of them. Although it was heavily mortgaged, he was proud of it nonetheless. It was a nineteenth-century Victorian built by a retired railroad man who died on the first Christmas Eve he spent in his new home. The facade was a huge, centered gable with hipped roof over a wide, inset front porch. Under the gable a small portico covered with bargeboard hung gently over the porch. The five supporting pillars were round and painted white and slate blue. Each column bore a handmade floral carving, each with a different flower-daffodils, irises, and sunflowers. The railing between the pillars was filled with lavish lacework. Upstairs, three bay windows opened onto a small balcony, and to the left of the balcony an octagonal tower with stained-glass windows protruded and rose above the gable until it peaked with an iron-crested finial. Below the tower and to the left of the porch, a wide, graceful veranda with ornamental railing extended from the house and served as a carport. The front panels were a collage of gingerbread, cedar shingles, scallops, fish scales, tiny intricate gables, and miniature spindles.

I got quite a few matches, but one local Chinese-Malaysian guy stood out immediately. He was very proactive in messaging me, and once he realized I’m from China, he even switched to Chinese to make me feel more at ease—which I really appreciated.

After chatting for just one day, he asked to meet up. To my surprise, our first meeting was… kind of perfect. He was extremely gentlemanly, thoughtful, and attentive. He chose a really nice restaurant, and judging from the car he drove, he seems to be doing quite well financially.

Right after that first date, he asked to see me again the next day. He spent time introducing me to this country and city, even took me to his favorite restaurant and a cocktail bar where the bartender—who seemed to know him well—joked that I was the *first girl* he ever brought there (though of course, I’m not taking that at face value).

Throughout all our interactions, he has been nothing but kind, warm, considerate, and mature. It all just feels… too good to be true. Is it really possible to meet someone *this* seemingly perfect on the first try? Or should I be worried there’s some kind of catch?

I’m not surprised to see the faux-surfer hair stink-eye guy sitting with her. St. Clair is talking about classes—what to expect my first day, who.....","We get in line to pay, and I’m surprised by how efficiently it runs. My old school was all about cutting ahead and incensing the lunch ladies, but here everyone waits patiently. I turn back just in time to catch his eyes flicker up and down my body. My breath catches. The beautiful boy is checking me out. He doesn’t realize I’ve caught him. “My mum is American,” he continues smoothly. “My father is French. I was born in San Francisco, and I was raised in London.”  Miraculously, I find my voice. “A true international.  He laughs. “That’s right. I’m not a poseur like the rest of you.”  I’m about to tease him back when I remember: He has a girlfriend. Something evil pokes the pink folds of my brain, forcing me to recall my conversation with Meredith last night. It’s time to change the subject. “What’s your real name? Last night you introduced yourself as—”  “St. Clair is my last name. Étienne is my first.  “Étienne St. Clair.” I try to pronounce it like him, all foreign and posh.  “Terrible, isn’t it?”  
  I’m laughing now. “Étienne is nice. Why don’t people call you that?  “Oh, ‘Étienne is nice.’ How generous of you.”  Another person gets in line behind us, a tiny boy with brown skin, acne, and a thick mat of black hair. The boy is excited to see him, and he smiles back. “Hey, Nikhil. Did you have a nice holiday?” It’s the same question he asked Amanda, but this time his tone is sincere.  
 That’s all it takes for the boy to launch into a story about his trip to Delhi, about the markets and temples and monsoons. (He went on a day trip to the Taj Mahal. I went to Panama City Beach with the rest of Georgia.) Another boy runs up, this one skinny and pale with sticky-uppy hair. Nikhil forgets us and greets his friend with the same enthusiastic babble.  
  St. Clair—I’m determined to call him this before I embarrass myself—turns back to me. “Nikhil is Rashmi’s brother. He’s a freshman this year. She also has a younger sister, Sanjita, who’s a junior, and an older sister, Leela, who graduated two years ago.”  
  
  “Do you have any brothers or sisters?”  
  
  “No. You?”  
  
  “One brother, but he’s back home. In Atlanta. That’s in Georgia. In the South?”  
  
  He raises an eyebrow. “I know where Atlanta is.”  
  
  “Oh. Right.” I hand my meal card to the man behind the register. Like Monsieur Boutin, he wears a pressed white uniform and starched hat. He also has a handlebar mustache. Huh. Didn’t know they had those over here. Chef Handlebar swipes my card and zips it back to me with a quick merci.  
  
  Thank you. Another word I already knew. Excellent.  
  
  On the way back to our table, Amanda watches St. Clair from inside her posse of Pretty Preppy People. I’m not surprised to see the faux-surfer hair stink-eye guy sitting with her. St. Clair is talking about classes—what to expect my first day, who my teachers are—but I’ve stopped listening. All I know is his crooked-tooth smile and his confident swaggery walk.  
  
  I’m just as big a fool as the rest of them.  
  
  chapter four  
  
  The H-through-P line moves slowly. The guy ahead of me is arguing with the guidance counselor. I glance at A-through-G, and see Meredith (Chevalier) and Rashmi (Devi) have already received their class schedules and exchanged them for comparison.  
  
  “But I didn’t ask for theater, I asked for computer science.”  
  
  The squat counselor is patient. “I know, but computer science didn’t fit with your schedule, and your alternate did. Maybe you can take computer science next—”  
  
  “My alternate was computer programming.”  
  
  Hold it. My attention snaps back. Can they do that? Put us in a class we didn’t ask for? I will die—DIE—if I have to take gym again.  
  
  “Actually, David.” The counselor sifts through her papers. “You neglected to fill out your alternate form, so we had to select the class for you. But I think you’ll find—”  
  
  The angry boy snatches his schedule from her hands and stalks off. Yikes. It’s not like it’s her fault. I step forward and say my name as kindly as possible, to make up for the jerk who just left. She gives a dimpled smile back. “I remember you, sweetie. Have a nice first day.” And she hands me a half sheet of yellow paper.  
  
  I hold my breath while I scan it. Phew. No surprises. Senior English, calculus, beginning French, physics, European history, and something dubiously called “La Vie.”  
  
  When I registered, the counselor described “Life” as a senior-only class, similar to a study hall but with occasional guest speakers who will lecture us about balancing checkbooks and renting apartments and baking quiches. Or whatever. I’m just relieved Mom let me take it. One of the decent things about this school is that math, science, and history aren’t required for seniors. Unfortunately, Mom is a purist and refused to let me graduate without another year of all three. “You’ll never get into the right college if you take ceramics,” she warned, frowning over my orientation packet.  
  
  Thanks, Mom. Send me away for some culture in a city known for its art and make me suffer through another math class. I shuffle toward Meredith and Rashmi, feeling like the third wheel but praying for some shared classes. I’m in luck. “Three with me and four with Rash!” Meredith beams and hands back my schedule. Her rainbow-colored plastic rings click against each other.  
  
  Rash. What an unfortunate nickname. They gossip about people I don’t know, and my mind wanders to the other side of the courtyard, where St. Clair waits with Josh in Q-through-Z. I wonder if I have any classes with him.  
  
  I mean, them. Classes with them.  
  
  The rain has stopped, and Josh kicks a puddle in St. Clair’s direction. St. Clair laughs and says something that makes them both laugh even harder. Suddenly I register that St. Clair is shorter than Josh. Much shorter. It’s odd I didn’t notice earlier, but he doesn’t carry himself like a short guy. Most are shy or defensive, or some messed-up combination of the two, but St. Clair is confident and friendly and—  
  
  “Jeez, stare much?”  
  
  “What?” I jerk my head back, but Rashmi’s not talking to me. She’s shaking her head at Meredith, who looks as sheepish as I feel.  
  
  “You’re burning holes into St. Clair’s head. It’s not attractive.”  
  
  “Shut up.” But Meredith smiles at me and shrugs.  
  
  Well. That settles that. As if I needed another reason not to lust. Boy Wonder is officially off-limits. “Don’t say anything to him,” she says. “Please.”  
  
  “Of course,” I say.  
  
  “Because we’re obviously just friends.”  
  
  “Obviously.”  
  
  We mill around until the head of school arrives for her welcome speech. The head is graceful and carries herself like a ballerina. She has a long neck, and her snow-white hair is pulled into a tidy knot that makes her look distinguished rather than elderly. The overall effect is Parisian, although I know from my acceptance letter she’s from Chicago. Her gaze glides across us, her one hundred handpicked pupils. “Welcome to another exciting year at the School of America in Paris. I’m pleased to see so many familiar faces, and I’m even happier to see the new ones.”  
  
  Apparently school speeches are one thing France can’t improve.  
  
  “To the students who attended last year, I invite you all to give a warm welcome to your new freshman class and to the new upperclassmen, as well.”  
  
  A smattering of polite applause. I glance around, and I’m startled to find St. Clair looking at me. He claps and lifts his hands in my direction. I blush and jerk away.  
  
  The head keeps talking. Focus, Anna. Focus. But I feel his stare as if it were the heat of the sun. My skin grows moist with sweat. I slide underneath one of the immaculately pruned trees. Why is he staring? Is he still staring? I think he is. Why why why? Is it a good stare or a bad stare or an indifferent stare?  
  
  But when I finally look, he’s not staring at me at all. He’s biting his pinkie nail.  
  
  The head wraps up, and Rashmi bounds off to jo  
in the guys. Meredith leads me inside for English. The professeur hasn’t arrived yet, so we choose seats in the back. The classroom is smaller than what I’m used to, and it has dark, gleaming trim and tall windows that look like doors. But the desks are the same, and the whiteboard and the wall-mounted pencil sharpener. I concentrate on these familiar items to ease my nerves.  
  
  “You’ll like Professeur Cole,” Meredith says. “She’s hilarious, and she always assigns the best books.”  
  
  “My dad is a novelist.” I blurt this without thinking and immediately regret it.  
  
  “Really? Who?”  
  
  “James Ashley.” That’s his pen name. I guess Oliphant wasn’t romantic enough.  
  
  “Who?”  
  
  The humiliation factor multiplies. “The Decision? The Entrance? They were made into movies. Forget it, they all have vague names like that—”  
  
  She leans forward, excited. “No, my mom loves The Entrance!”  
  
  I wrinkle my nose.  
  
  “They aren’t that bad. I watched The Entrance with her once and totally cried when that girl died of leukemia.”  
  
  “Who died of leukemia?” Rashmi plops her backpack down next to me. St. Clair trails in behind her and takes the seat in front of Meredith.  
  
  “Anna’s dad wrote The Entrance,” Meredith says.  
  
  I cough. “Not something I’m proud of.”  
  
  “I’m sorry, what’s The Entrance?” Rashmi asks.  
  
  “It’s that movie about the boy who helps deliver the baby girl in the elevator, and then he grows up to fall in love with her,” Meredith says as St. Clair leans back in his chair and nabs her schedule. “But the day after their engagement, she’s diagnosed with leukemia.”  
  
  “Her father pushes her down the aisle in a wheelchair,” I continue. “And then she dies on the honeymoon.”  
  
  “Ugh,” Rashmi and St. Clair say together.  
  
  Enough embarrassment. “Where’s Josh?” I ask.  
  
  “He’s a junior,” Rashmi says, as if I should have known this already. “We dropped him off at pre-calc.”  
  
  “Oh.” Our conversation hits a dead end. Lovely.  
  
  “Three classes together, Mer. Give us yours.” St. Clair leans back again and steals my half sheet. “Ooo, beginning French.”  
  
  “Told you.”  
  
  “It’s not so bad.” He hands back my schedule and smiles. “You’ll be reading the breakfast menu without me before you know it.”  
  
  Hmm, maybe I don’t want to learn French.  
  
  Argh! Boys turn girls into such idiots.  
  
  “Bonjour à tous.” A woman wearing a bold turquoise dress strides in and smacks her coffee cup down on the podium. She’s youngish, and she has the blondest hair I’ve ever seen on a teacher. “For the—” Her eyes scan the room until they land on me.  
  
  What? What did I do?  
  
  “For the singular person who doesn’t know me, je m’appelle Professeur Cole.” She gives an exaggerated curtsy, and the class laughs. They swivel around to stare.  
  
  “Hello,” I say in a tiny voice.  
  
  Suspicions confirmed. Out of the twenty-five people present—the entire senior class—I’m the only new student. This means my classmates have yet another advantage over me, because every one of them is familiar with the teachers. The school is so small that each subject is taught by the same professeur in all four grades.  
  
  I wonder what student left to vacate my position? Probably someone cooler than me. Someone with dreadlocks and pinup girl tattoos and connections in the music industry.  
  
  “I see the janitorial staff has ignored my wishes once again,” Professeur Cole says. “Everyone [up.You](http://up.You) know the drill.”  
  
  I don’t, but I push my desk when everyone else starts pushing theirs. We arrange them in a big circle. It’s odd to see all of my classmates at the same time. I take the opportunity to size them up. I don’t think I stand out, but their jeans and shoes and backpacks are more expensive than mine. They look cleaner, shinier.  
  
  No surprise there. My mom is a high school biology teacher, which doesn’t give us a lot of extra spending money. Dad pays for the mortgage and helps with the bills, but it’s not enough, and Mom is too proud to ask for more. She says he’d refuse her anyway and just go buy another elliptical machine.  
  
  There may be some truth to that.  
  
  The rest of the morning passes in a blur. I like Professeur Cole, and my math teacher, Professeur Babineaux, is nice enough. He’s Parisian, and he waggles his eyebrows and spits when he [talks.To](http://talks.To) be fair, I don’t think the spitting is a French thing. I think he just has a lisp. It’s hard to tell with the accent.  
  
  After that, I have beginning French. Professeur Gillet turns out to be another Parisian. Figures. They always send in native speakers for foreign language classes. My Spanish teachers were always rolling their eyes and exclaiming, “¡Aye, dios mio!” whenever I raised my hand. They got frustrated when I couldn’t grasp a concept that seemed obvious to them.  
  
  I stopped raising my hand.  
  
  As predicted, the class is a bunch of freshmen. And me. Oh, and one junior, the angry scheduling guy from this morning. He introduces himself enthusiastically as Dave, and I can tell he’s as relieved as I am to not be the only upperclassman.  
  
  Maybe Dave is pretty cool after all.  
  
  At noon, I follow the stampede to the cafeteria. I avoid the main line and go straight to the counter with the choose-your-own fruit and bread, even though the pasta smells amazing. I’m such a wuss. I’d rather starve than try to order in French. “Oui, oui!” I’d say, pointing at random words on the chalkboard. Then Chef Handlebar would present me with something revolting, and I’d have to buy it out of shame. Of course I meant to order the roasted pigeon! Mmm! Just like Nanna’s.  
  
  Meredith and her friends are lounging at the same table as this morning. I take a deep breath and join them. To my relief, no one looks surprised. Meredith asks St. Clair if he’s seen his girlfriend yet. He relaxes into his chair. “No, but we’re meeting tonight.”  
  
  “Did you see her this summer? Have her classes started? What’s she taking this semester?” She keeps asking questions about Ellie to which he gives short replies. Josh and Rashmi are making out—I can actually see tongue—so I turn to my bread and grapes. How biblical of me.  
  
  The grapes are smaller than I’m used to, and the skin is slightly textured. Is that dirt? I dip my napkin in water and dab at the tiny purple globes. It helps, but they’re still sort of rough. Hmm. St. Clair and Meredith stop talking. I glance up to find them staring at me in matching bemusement. “What?”  
  
  “Nothing,” he says. “Continue your grape bath.”  
  
  “They were dirty.”  
  
  “Have you tried one?” she asks.  
  
  “No, they’ve still got these little mud flecks.” I hold one up to show them. St. Clair plucks it from my fingers and pops it into his mouth. I’m hypnotized by his lips, his throat, as he swallows.  
  
  I hesitate.Would I rather have clean food or his good opinion?  
  
  He picks up another and smiles. “Open up.”  
  
  I open up.  
  
  The grape brushes my lower lip as he slides it in. It explodes in my mouth, and I’m so startled by the juice that I nearly spit it out.The flavor is intense, more like grape candy than actual fruit. To say I’ve tasted nothing like it before is an understatement. Meredith and St. Clair laugh. “Wait until you try them as wine,” she says.  
  
  St. Clair twirls a forkful of pasta. “So. How was French class?”  
  
  The abrupt subject change makes me shudder. “Professeur Gillet is scary. She’s all frown lines.” I tear off a piece of baguette. The crust crackles, and the inside is light and springy. Oh, man. I shove another hunk into my mouth.  
  
  Meredith looks thoughtful. “She can be intimidating at first, but she’s really nice once you get to know her.”  
  
  “Mer is her star pupil,” St. Clair says.  
  
  Rashmi breaks apart from Josh, who looks dazed by the fresh air. “She’s taking advanced French and advanced Spanish,” she adds.  
  
  “Maybe you can  
be my tutor,” I say to Meredith. “I stink at foreign languages. The only reason this place overlooked my Spanish grades was because the head reads my father’s dumb novels.”  
  
  “How do you know?” she asks.  
  
  I roll my eyes. “She mentioned it once or twice in my phone interview.” She kept asking questions about casting decisions for The Lighthouse. Like Dad has any say in that. Or like I care. She didn’t realize my cinematic tastes are a bit more sophisticated.  
  
  “I’d like to learn Italian,” Meredith says. “But they don’t offer it here. I want to go to college in Rome next year. Or maybe London. I could study it there, too.”  
  
  “Surely Rome is a better place to study Italian?” I ask.  
  
  “Yeah, well.” She steals a glance at St. Clair. “I’ve always liked London.”  
  
  Poor Mer. She’s got it bad.  
  
  “What do you want to do?” I ask him. “Where are you going?”  
  
  St. Clair shrugs. It’s slow and full-bodied, surprisingly French. The same shrug the waiter at the restaurant last night gave me when I asked if they served pizza. “Don’t know. It depends, though I’d like to study history.” He leans forward, like he’s about to share a naughty secret. “I’ve always wanted to be one of those blokes they interview on BBC or PBS [specials.You](http://specials.You) know, with the crazy eyebrows and suede elbow patches.”  
  
  Just like me! Sort of. “I want to be on the classic movies channel and discuss Hitchcock and Capra with Robert Osborne. He hosts most of their programs. I mean I know he’s an old dude, but he’s so freaking cool. He knows everything about film.”  
  
  “Really?” He sounds genuinely interested.  
  
  “St. Clair’s head is always in history books the size of dictionaries,” Meredith interrupts. “It’s hard to get him out of his room.”  
  
  “That’s because Ellie’s always in there,” Rashmi says drily.  
  
  “You’re one to talk.” He gestures toward Josh. “Not to mention . . . Henri.”  
  
  “Henri!” Meredith says, and she and St. Clair burst into laughter.  
  
  “One frigging afternoon, and you’ll never let me forget it.” Rashmi glances at Josh, who stabs his pasta.   “Who’s Henri?” I trip over the pronunciation. En-ree.  
  
  “This tour guide on a field trip to Versailles sophomore year,” St. Clair says. “Skinny little bugger, but Rashmi ditched us in the Hall of Mirrors and threw herself at him—”  
  
  “I did not!”  
  
  Meredith shakes her head. “They groped, like, all afternoon. Full public display.”  
  
  “The whole school waited on the bus for two hours, because she forgot what time we were supposed to meet back,” he says.  
  
  “It was NOT two hours—”  
  
  Meredith continues. “Professeur Hansen finally tracked her down behind some shrubbery in the formal gardens, and she had teeth marks all over her neck.”  
  
  “Teeth marks!” St. Clair snorts.  
  
  Rashmi fumes. “Shut up, English Tongue.”  
  
  “Huh?”  
  
  “English Tongue,” she says. “That’s what we all called you after your and Ellie’s breathtaking display at the street fair last spring.” St. Clair tries to protest, but he’s laughing too hard. Meredith and Rashmi continue jabbing back and forth, but . . . I’m lost again. I wonder if Matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on. He was probably a bad kisser because of me.  
  
  Oh, no.  
  
  I’m a bad kisser. I am, I must be.  
  
  Someday I’ll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips, and it’ll be engraved with the words WORLD’S WORST KISSER. And Matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate, but I didn’t put out, so I was a waste of time because Cherrie Milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out. Everyone knows it.  
  
  Oh God. Does Toph think I’m a bad kisser?  
  
  It only happened once. My last night at the movie theater was also the last night before I left for France. It was slow, and we’d been alone in the lobby for most of the evening. Maybe because it was my final shift, maybe because we wouldn’t see each other again for four months, maybe because it felt like a last chance—whatever the reason, we were reckless. We were brave. The flirting escalated all night long, and by the time we were told to go home, we couldn’t walk away. We just kept . . . drawing out the conversation.  
  
  And then, finally, he said he would miss me.  
  
  And then, finally, he kissed me under the buzzing marquee.  
  
  And then I left.  
  
  “Anna? Are you all right?” someone asks.  
  
  The whole table is staring at me.  
  
  Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Don’t cry. “Um.Where’s the bathroom?” The bathroom is my favorite excuse for any situation. No one ever inquires further once you mention it.  
  
  “The toilets are down the hall.” St. Clair looks concerned but doesn’t dare ask. He’s probably afraid I’ll talk about tampon absorbency or mention the dreaded P-word.  
  
  I spend the rest of lunch in a stall. I miss home so much that it physically hurts. My head throbs, my stomach is nauseous, and it’s all so unfair. I never asked to be sent here. I had my own friends and my own inside jokes and my own stolen kisses. I wish my parents had offered me the choice: “Would you like to spend your senior year in Atlanta or Paris?”  
  
  Who knows? Maybe I would have picked Paris.  
  
  What my parents never considered is that I just wanted a choice.

  From: Bridgette Saunderwick  
  
  Subject: Don’t look now but . . .  
  
  ... the bottom right corner of your bed is untucked. HA! Made you look. Now stop smoothing out invisible wrinkles. Seriously. How’s Le Academe du Fraunch? Any hotties I should know about? Speaking of, guess who’s in my calc class?? Drew! He dyed his hair black and got a lip ring. And he’s totally callipygian (look it up, lazy ass). I sat with the usual at lunch, but it wasn’t the same without you. Not to mention freaking Cherrie showed up. She kept flipping her hair around, and I swear I heard you humming that TRESemmé commercial. I’ll gouge out my eyes with Sean’s Darth Maul action figure if she sits with us every day. By the way, your mom hired me to babysit him after school, so I’d better go. Don’t want him to die on my watch.  
  
  You suck. Come home.  
  
  Bridge  
  
  P.S. Tomorrow they’re announcing section leaders in band. Wish me luck. If they give my spot to Kevin Quiggley, I’ll gouge out HIS eyes with Darth Maul.  
  
  Callipygian. Having shapely buttocks. Nice one, Bridge.  
  
  My best friend is a word fiend. One of her most prized possessions is her OED, which she bought for practically nothing at a yard sale two years ago. The Oxford English Dictionary is a twenty-volume set that not only provides definitions of words but their histories as well. Bridge is always throwing big words into conversations, because she loves to watch people squirm and bluff their way around them. I learned a long time ago not to pretend to know what she was talking about. She’d call me on it every time.  
  
  So Bridgette collects words and, apparently, my life.  
  
  I can’t believe Mom hired her to watch Sean. I know she’s the best choice, since we were always watching him together, but still. It’s weird she’s there without me. And it’s weird that she’s talking to my mom while I’m stuck here on the other side of the world. Next she’ll tell me she got a second job at the movie theater.  
  
  Speaking of, Toph hasn’t emailed me in two days. It’s not like I expected him to write every day‚ or even every week, but . . . there was an undeniable something between us. I mean, we kissed. Will this thing—whatever it is—end now that I’m here?  
  
  His real name is Christopher, but he hates being called Chris, so he goes by Toph instead. He has shocking green eyes and wicked sideburns.We’re both left-handed, we both love the fake nacho cheese at the concession stand, and we both hate Cuba Gooding Jr. I’ve crushed on Toph since my first day on the job, when he stuck his head under the ICEE machine and guzzled it straight from the tap to make me laugh. He had Blue Raspberry Mouth for the rest of his shift.  
  
  Not many people can pull off blue teeth. But believe me, Toph can.  
  
  I refresh my inbox—just in case—but nothing new appears. I’ve been planted in front of my computer for several hours, waiting for Bridge to get out of school. I’m glad she emailed me. For some reason, I wanted her to write first. Maybe because I wanted her to think I was so happy and busy that I didn’t have time to talk. When, in reality, I’m sad and alone.  
  
  And hungry. My mini-fridge is empty.  
  
  I had dinner in the cafeteria but avoided the main food line again, stuffing myself with more bread, which only lasts so long. Maybe St. Clair will order breakfast for me again in the morning. Or Meredith; I bet she’d do it.  
  
  I reply to Bridge, telling her about my new sort-of-friends, the crazy cafeteria with restaurant-quality food, and the giant Panthéon down the road. Despite myself, I describe St. Clair, and mention how in physics he leaned over Meredith to borrow a pen from me, right when Professeur Wakefield was assigning lab partners. So the teacher thought he was sitting next to me, and now St. Clair is my lab partner for the WHOLE YEAR.  
  
  Which was the best thing that happened all day.  
  
  I also tell Bridge about the mysterious Life class, La Vie, because she and I spent the entire summer speculating. (Me: “I bet we’ll debate the Big Bang and the Meaning of Life.” Bridge: “Dude, they’ll probably teach you breathing techniques and how to convert food into energy.”) All we did today was sit quietly and work on homework.  
  
  What a pity.  
  
  I spent the period reading the first novel assigned for English. And, wow. If I hadn’t realized I was in France yet, I do now. Because Like Water for Chocolate has sex in it. LOTS of sex. A woman’s desire literally lights a building on fire, and then a soldier throws her naked body onto a horse, and they totally do it while galloping away. There’s no way they would have let me read this back in the Bible Belt. The sexiest we ever got was The Scarlet Letter.  
  
  I must tell Bridge about this book.  
  
  It’s  
almost midnight when I finish the email, but the hallway is still noisy.The juniors and seniors have a lot of freedom because, supposedly, we’re mature enough to handle it. I am, but I have serious doubts as to my classmates.The guy across the hall already has a pyramid of beer bottles stacked outside his door because, in Paris, sixteen-year-olds are allowed to drink wine and beer. You have to be eighteen to get hard liquor.  
  
  Not that I haven’t seen that around here, too.  
  
  I wonder if my mother had any idea it’d be legal for me to get wasted when she agreed to this. She looked pretty surprised when they mentioned it at the Life Skills Seminars, and I got a long lecture on responsibility that night at dinner. But I don’t plan on getting drunk. I’ve always thought beer smells like urine.  
  
  There are a few part-timers who work the front desk, but only one live-in Résidence Director. His name is Nate, and his apartment is on the first floor. He’s in graduate school at some university around here. SOAP must pay him a lot to live with us.  
  
  Nate is in his twenties, and he’s short and pale and has a shaved head. Which sounds strange but is actually attractive. He’s soft-spoken and seems like the kind of guy who’d be a good listener, but his tone exudes responsibility and a don’t-mess-with-me attitude. My parents loved him. He also has a bowl of condoms next to his door.  
  
  I wonder if my parents saw that.  
  
  The freshmen and sophomores are in another dormitory. They have to share rooms, and their floors are divided by sex, and they have tons of supervision. They also have enforced curfews. We don’t.We just have to sign a log whenever we come and go at night so Nate knows we’re still alive.Yeah. I’m sure no one ever takes advantage of this high security.  
  
  I drag myself down the hall to use the bathroom. I take my place in line—there’s always a line, even at midnight—behind Amanda, the girl who attacked St. Clair at breakfast. She smirks at my faded jeans and my vintage Orange Crush T-shirt.  
  
  I didn’t know she lived on my floor. Super.  
  
  We don’t speak. I trace the floral pattern on the wallpaper with my fingers. Résidence Lambert is a peculiar mix of Parisian refinement and teenage practicality. Crystal light fixtures give the dormitory halls a golden glow, but fluorescent bulbs hum inside our bedrooms. The floors are glossy hardwood but lined with industrial-grade rugs. Fresh flowers and Tiffany lamps grace the lobby, but the chairs are ratty love seats, and the tables are carved with initials and rude words.  
  
  “So you’re the new Brandon,” Amanda says.  
  
  “Excuse me?”  
  
  “Brandon. Number twenty-five. He was expelled from school last year; one of the teachers found coke in his backpack.” She looks me over again and frowns. “Where are you from, anyway?” But I know what she’s really asking. She wants to know why they picked someone like me to take his place.  
  
  “Atlanta.”  
  
  “Oh,” she says. As if that explains my complete and utter hick-ness. Screw her. It’s one of the largest cities in America.  
  
  “So you and St. Clair seemed pretty friendly at breakfast.”  
  
  “Um.” Is she threatened by me?  
  
  “I wouldn’t get any ideas if I were you,” she continues. “Not even you’re pretty enough to steal him from his girlfriend.They’ve been together forever.”  
  
  Was that a compliment? Or not? Her emphasizing thing is really getting on my nerves. (My nerves.)  
  
  Amanda gives a fake, bored yawn. “Interesting hair.”  
  
  I touch it self-consciously. “Thanks. My friend bleached it.” Bridge added the thick band to my dark brown hair just last week. Normally, I keep the stripe tucked behind my right ear, but tonight it’s back in a ponytail.  
  
  “Do you like it?” she asks. Universal bitch-speak for I think it’s hideous.  
  
  I drop my hand. “Yeah. That’s why I did it.”  
  
  “You know, I wouldn’t pull it back like [that.You](http://that.You) kinda look like a skunk.”  
  
  “At least she doesn’t reek like one.” Rashmi appears behind me. She’d been visiting Meredith; I’d heard their muffled voices through my walls. “Delightful perfume, Amanda. Use a little more next time. I don’t know if they can smell you in London.”  
  
  Amanda snarls. “Nice glasses.”  
  
  “Good one,” Rashmi deadpans, but I notice she adjusts them anyway. Her nails are electric blue, the same shade as her frames. She turns to me. “I live two floors up, room six-o-one, if you need anything. See you at breakfast.”  
  
  So she doesn’t dislike me! Or maybe she just hates Amanda more. Either way, I’m thankful, and I call goodbye to her retreating figure. She waves a hand and moves into the stairwell as Nate comes out of it. He approaches us in his quiet, friendly manner.  
  
  “Going to bed soon, ladies?”  
  
  Amanda smiles sweetly. “Of course.”  
  
  “Great. Did you have a nice first day, Anna?”  
  
  It’s so peculiar how everyone here already knows my name. “Yeah. Thanks, Nate.”  
  
  He nods as if I’ve said something worth thinking about, and then says good night and moves on to the guys hanging out at the other end of the hallway.  
  
  “I hate it when he does that,” Amanda says.  
  
  “Does what?”  
  
  “Check up on us. What an asshole.” The bathroom door opens, and a tiny redhead maneuvers around Amanda, who just stands there like she’s Queen of the Threshold. The girl must be a junior. I don’t recognize her from the circle of desks in senior English. “God, did you fall in?” Amanda asks. The girl’s pale skin turns pink.  
  
  “She was just using the restroom,” I say.  
  
  Amanda sashays onto the tile, her fuzzy purple slippers slapping against her heels. She yanks the door shut. “Does it look like I care? Skunk Girl?”  
  
  chapter six  
  
  One week into school, and I’m knee-deep in Fancy International Education.  
  
  Professeur Cole’s syllabus is free of the usual Shakespeare and Steinbeck, and instead, we’re focusing on translated works. Every morning she hosts the discussion of Like Water for Chocolate as if we were a book club and not some boring, required class.  
  
  So English is excellent.  
  
  On the other hand, my French teacher is clearly illiterate. How else to explain the fact that despite the name of our textbook—Level One French—Professeur Gillet insists on speaking in French only? She also calls on me a dozen times a day. I never know the answer.  
  
  Dave calls her Madame Guillotine. This is also excellent.  
  
  He’s taken the class before, which is helpful but obviously not really helpful, as he failed it the first go-round. Dave has shaggy hair and pouty lips, and the peculiar combination of tan skin and freckles. Several girls have a crush on him. He’s also in my history class. I’m with the juniors, because the seniors take government, and I’ve already studied it. So I sit between Dave and Josh.  
  
  Josh is quiet and reserved in class, but outside of it, his sense of humor is similar to St. Clair’s. It’s easy to understand why they’re such good friends. Meredith says they idolize each other, Josh because of St. Clair’s innate charisma, and St. Clair because Josh is an astounding artist. I rarely see Josh without his brush pen or sketchbook. His work is incredible—thick bold strokes and teeny exquisite details—and his fingers are always stained with ink.  
  
  But the most notable aspect of my new education is the one that takes place outside of class.The one never mentioned in the glossy brochures. And that is this: attending boarding school is like living inside a high school. I can’t get away. Even when I’m in my bedroom, my ears are blasted by pop music, fistfights over washing machines, and drunk dancing in the stairwell. Meredith claims it’ll settle down once the novelty wears off for the juniors, but I’m not holding my breath.  
  
  However.  
  
  It’s Friday night, and Résidence Lambert has cleared out. My classmates are hitting the bars, and I have peace for the first time. If I close my eyes, I can almost believe I’m back home. Except for the opera. The Opera Diva sings most evenings at the restaurant across the street. For someone with such a huge v  
oice, she’s surprisingly small. She’s also one of those people who shaves her eyebrows and draws them back on with a pencil. She looks like an extra from The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  
  
  Bridge calls as I’m watching Rushmore from the comfort of my mini-bed. It’s the film that launched Wes Anderson. Wes is amazing, a true auteur involved in every aspect of production, with a trademark style recognizable in any frame—wistful and quirky, deadpan and dark. Rushmore is one of my favorites. It’s about a guy named Max Fischer who is obsessed with, among many things, the private school that kicked him out.What would my life be like if I were as passionate about SOAP as Max is about Rushmore Academy? For starters, I probably wouldn’t be alone in my bedroom covered in white pimple cream.  
  
  “Annnnn-uhhhhhh,” Bridge says. “I haaaaate themmmm.”  
  
  She didn’t get section leader in band.Which is lame, because everyone knows she’s the most talented drummer in school. The percussion instructor gave it to Kevin Quiggley, because he thought the guys on the drumline wouldn’t respect Bridge as a leader—because she’s a girl.  
  
  Yeah, well, now they won’t. Jerk.  
  
  So Bridge hates band and hates the instructor and hates Kevin, who is a twerp with a disproportionately large ego. “Just wait,” I say. “Soon you’ll be the next MegWhite or Sheila E., and Kevin Quiggley will brag about how he knew you back when. And then when he approaches you after some big show, expecting special treatment and a backstage pass? You can sashay right past him without so much as a backward glance.”  
  
  I hear the weary smile in her voice. “Why’d you move away again, Banana?”  
  
  “Because my father is made of suck.”  
  
  “The purest strain, dude.”  
  
  We talk until three a.m., so I don’t wake up until early afternoon. I scramble to get dressed before the cafeteria closes. It’s only open for brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. It’s quiet when I arrive, but Rashmi and Josh and St. Clair are seated at their usual table.

1la5irf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1la5irf/maplestory_withdrawal_syndrome/,Maplestory Withdrawal Syndrome,"Maplestory Withdrawal Syndrome (ICD-X: Digital Dopaminergic Depletion Disorder)

ICD-10 Code: F63.89 — Behavioral addiction, digital gaming-related, specified

1. **Definition**: A neurobehavioral syndrome resulting from abrupt cessation of chronic MapleStory exposure, particularly in individuals previously engaged in endgame bossing, grandis symbol dailies, or prolonged WAPing. Characterized by dopaminergic dysregulation, virtual limbic detachment, and maladaptive real-world coping attempts.
2. **Pathophysiology**:

a. Chronic overstimulation of the mesolimbic reward pathway via mesos, frags, and cubing leads to dopaminergic receptor downregulation.

b. Abrupt cessation results in dopamine deficiency, manifesting as motivational collapse and executive dysfunction.

c. Associated with parasocial detachment (e.g., from VHilla \[dommy mommy\], Cygnus, and Lucid).

3. **Clinical representation**:

a. *Phase I - Crash (0-48 hours)*

1) Psychomotor retardation- Sudden loss of keyboard reflexes, inability to press ""Y"" instinctively.

2) Hypersomnia- Excessive sleeping due to lack of urgent weekly boss resets and WAPing.

3) Hyperphagia- Compensatory overeating of real-life food (esp. junk) in absence of MVP buff timers.

b. *Phase II - Acute Withdrawal (2-7 days)*

*1)* Anhedonia- Inability to experience pleasure from normal stimuli (e.g., human interaction, sunlight).

2) Affective flattening- Inexpressive face due to absence of chair flexing in Monster Park.

3) Severe irritability- Especially when reminded ""it's just a game.""

4) Cravings- Compulsive urge to log in “just to do dailies real quick.”

5) Vivid dreams- Often involve failed 21-SF PB enhancement or failing a Grindstone.

c. *Phase III - Protracted Withdrawal (Weeks+)*

1) Existential confusion- Wondering what to do with hands and life at 10 PM.

2) Auditory hallucinations- Phantom sounds of Carcion music or Cubing SFX.

3) Depersonalization: Feeling like a pre-grandis-bossing scrub in the real world.

4. **Management**:

a. Supportive care: Structured schedules, social re-integration, and exposure to non-pixelated nature.

b. Pharmacologic interventions: None FDA-approved. Experimental use of dopamine agonists (e.g., exercise, coffee, actual social bonding, Cocaine).

c. Relapse prevention: Avoid re-installing Nexon Launcher “just to check cash shop.” This includes ""Steam"" too.

5. **Prognosis**:

a. Most cases resolve with time, peer support, and realization that doing all dailies on 6 champions is not sustainable.

b. However, re-exposure (e.g., Summer/Winter update, Challenger World, or boss rework) carries high risk of relapse.",13,1749783790.0,Maplestory,5,0.84,False

Liam and I started talking back in October of 2024. Liam recently broke up with his long term, girlfriend. (Q) Liam and I went on 3 dates back in October. The first date was a overall good experience. but it ended with a bad kiss. He laughed and said you arevnot the best kisser. which has caused me to be a little self-conscious about kissing other people. we had another date now comes forward Halloween. we decide to go trick-or-treating together with his friends. His ex Gf (Q) kept messaging him throughout the night. which caused him to stop paying attention to me and others around him. I told him it felt like he wasn’t interested. I was feeling a little insecure because I know (Q) is a lot skinny than me when i am a bigger girl. We broke it off after we were done trick-or-treating. 
We decided to be friends and then he continued to flirt with me and I told him I felt like he was playing with my emotions so I decided to block him on everything. After we broke it off (Q) message me. Something along the line of this “please be careful with him. And take your time with liam because of his ocd n shit.” A couple months passed by. I’m starting to talk to another guy which quickly ends soon. I unblocked liam. A week after he messaged me. We start talking and decided to get coffee together.  We get coffee and decided to try again. But then he start being self pity and saying he going to hurt me again. I argued that it was my decision to start this again. But it didnt make liam agree so we broke it off again. A week after we were both we hung out again.  We had a really meaningful conversation about everything. We made out in my truck. I felt pretty good after that like we are getting on the right track after everything. But once again the circle repeats itself he does self pity thing. I block him. Over a month i unblock him.

We stopped because i was very emotional invested. We talked as friends but i was short n dry. He followed my ex gf (P). He told he was thinking of message her i told him i was uncomfortable with that. We argued over this. I said if i messaged (Q) how he would feel. He said i would be mad and jealous. I was like okay then you see my point. We drifted apart but he starts messaging occasionally i was short n dry again. Until one night he calls me very upset. He explains that he was messaging (P). And that P was best friends with his ex (Q) and  she told liam that (Q) cheated on him. But i was blind with rage and yelled at him for going behind my back and messaging p. He yells at me saying that he just found out that the LOVE OF HIS LIFE was cheating on. I just hung up n blocked him. That was a month ago but a couple days i had a really bad sexual experience with a guy. I need to just talk to him. I unblock him and call him. I was crying n upset. He calms me down. We been speaking again. I just don’t know what to do with him. It seems like i cant keep him block. It like i am tied with him somehow. I really do like him and dream of a relationship with him.

 I just started to be really careful about avoiding seed oils 2 days ago (although I had mostly cooked at home in ghee/olive oil for the last 3 years, eating out about 30% of the time which would probably mean seed oil exposure or getting a matcha made with oat milk at a coffee shop which usually has seed oils) 

anyways, I’m noticing a huge difference in mood & energy- I’m happier and have way more energy throughout the day. I’m literally in shock because I’ve had chronic fatigue for 3+ years and a history of hormonal imbalances/PCOS which come with insulin resistance. I’m also in my luteal phase when energy and mood really tank for me so this is a pleasant surprise.

His air quotes practically crackled over the phone line as he declared living abroad to be a “good learning experience” and a “keepsake I’d treasure forever.” Yeah. Keepsake. And I would.....","**Chapter one**  
  Here is everything I know about France: Madeline and Amélie and Moulin Rouge. The Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, although I have no idea what the function of either actually is. Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and a lot of kings named Louis. I’m not sure what they did either, but I think it has something to do with the French Revolution, which has something to do with Bastille Day. The art museum is called the Louvre and it’s shaped like a pyramid and the Mona Lisa lives there along with that statue of the woman missing her arms. And there are cafés or bistros or whatever they call them on every street corner. And mimes. The food is supposed to be good, and the people drink a lot of wine and smoke a lot of cigarettes.  I’ve heard they don’t like Americans, and they don’t like white sneakers.  A few months ago, my father enrolled me in boarding school. His air quotes practically crackled over the phone line as he declared living abroad to be a “good learning experience” and a “keepsake I’d treasure forever.” Yeah. Keepsake. And I would’ve pointed out his misuse of the word had I not already been freaking out.  Since his announcement, I’ve tried yelling, begging, pleading, and crying, but nothing has convinced him otherwise. And now I have a new student visa and a passport, each declaring me: Anna Oliphant, citizen of the United States of America. And now I’m here with my parents—unpacking my belongings in a room smaller than my suitcase—the newest senior at the School of America in Paris.  It’s not that I’m ungrateful. I mean, it’s Paris. The City of Light! The most romantic city in the world! I’m not immune to that. It’s just this whole international boarding school thing is a lot more about my father than it is about me. Ever since he sold out and started writing lame books that were turned into even lamer movies, he’s been trying to impress his big-shot New York friends with how cultured and rich he is.  
  My father isn’t cultured. But he is rich.  It wasn’t always like this.When my parents were still married, we were strictly lower middle class. It was around the time of the divorce that all traces of decency vanished, and his dream of being the next great Southern writer was replaced by his desire to be the next published writer. So he started writing these novels set in Small Town Georgia about folks with Good American Values who Fall in Love and then contract Life-Threatening Diseases and Die.  
  I’m serious.  And it totally depresses me, but the ladies eat it up.They love my father’s books and they love his cable-knit sweaters and they love his bleachy smile and orangey tan. And they have turned him into a bestseller and a total dick.  Two of his books have been made into movies and three more are in production, which is where his real money comes from. Hollywood. And, somehow, this extra cash and pseudo-prestige have warped his brain into thinking that I should live in France. For a year. Alone. I don’t understand why he couldn’t send me to Australia or Ireland or anywhere else where English is the native language. The only French word I know is oui, which means “yes,” and only recently did I learn it’s spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e.  
  
  At least the people in my new school speak English. It was founded for pretentious Americans who don’t like the company of their own children. I mean, really. Who sends their kid to boarding school? It’s so Hogwarts. Only mine doesn’t have cute boy wizards or magic candy or flying lessons.  
  
  Instead, I’m stuck with ninety-nine other students. There are twenty-five people in my entire senior class, as opposed to the six hundred I had back in Atlanta. And I’m studying the same things I studied at Clairemont High except now I’m registered in beginning French.  Oh, yeah. Beginning French. No doubt with the freshmen. I totally rock.  Mom says I need to lose the bitter factor, pronto, but she’s not the one leaving behind her fabulous best friend, Bridgette. Or her fabulous job at the Royal Midtown 14 multiplex. Or Toph, the fabulous boy at the Royal Midtown 14 multiplex.  And I still can’t believe she’s separating me from my brother, Sean, who is only seven and way too young to be left home alone after school. Without me, he’ll probably be kidnapped by that creepy guy down the road who has dirty Coca-Cola towels hanging in his windows. Or Seany will accidentally eat something containing Red Dye #40 and his throat will swell up and no one will be there to drive him to the hospital. He might even die. And I bet they wouldn’t let me fly home for his funeral and I’d have to visit the cemetery alone next year and Dad will have picked out some god-awful granite cherub to go over his grave.  And I hope Dad doesn’t expect me to fill out college applications to Russia or Romania now. My dream is to study film theory in California. I want to be our nation’s greatest female film critic. Someday I’ll be invited to every festival, and I’ll have a major newspaper column and a cool television show and a ridiculously popular website. So far I only have the website, and it’s not so popular.Yet.  
  I just need a little more time to work on it, that’s all.  
  
  “Anna, it’s time.”  
  
  “What?” I glance up from folding my shirts into perfect squares.  
  
  Mom stares at me and twiddles the turtle charm on her necklace. My father, bedecked in a peach polo shirt and white boating shoes, is gazing out my dormitory window. It’s late, but across the street a woman belts out something operatic.  
  
  My parents need to return to their hotel rooms. They both have early morning flights.  
  
  “Oh.” I grip the shirt in my hands a little tighter.  
  
  Dad steps away from the window, and I’m alarmed to discover his eyes are wet. Something about the idea of my father—even if it is my father—on the brink of tears raises a lump in my throat.  
  
  “Well, kiddo. Guess you’re all grown up now.”  
  
  My body is frozen. He pulls my stiff limbs into a bear hug. His grip is frightening. “Take care of yourself. Study hard and make some friends. And watch out for pickpockets,” he adds. “Sometimes they work in pairs.”  
  
  I nod into his shoulder, and he releases me. And then he’s gone.  
  
  My mother lingers behind. “You’ll have a wonderful year here,” she says. “I just know it.” I bite my lip to keep it from quivering, and she sweeps me into her arms. I try to breathe. Inhale. Count to three. Exhale. Her skin smells like grapefruit body lotion. “I’ll call you the moment I get home,” she says.  
  
  Home. Atlanta isn’t my home anymore.  
  
  “I love you, Anna.”  
  
  I’m crying now. “I love you, too. Take care of Seany for me.”  
  
  “Of course.”  
  
  “And Captain Jack,” I say. “Make sure Sean feeds him and changes his bedding and fills his water bottle. And make sure he doesn’t give him too many treats because they make him fat and then he can’t get out of his igloo. But make sure he gives him at least a few every day, because he still needs the vitamin C and he won’t drink the water when I use those vitamin drops—”  
  
  She pulls back and tucks my bleached stripe behind my ear. “I love you,” she says again.  
  
  And then my mother does something that, even after all of the paperwork and plane tickets and presentations, I don’t see coming. Something that would’ve happened in a year anyway, once I left for college, but that no matter how many days or months or years I’ve yearned for it, I am still not prepared for when it actually happens.  
  
  My mother leaves. I am alone.  
  
  chapter two  
  
  I feel it coming, but I can’t stop it.  
  
  PANIC.  
  
  They left me. My parents actually left me! IN FRANCE!  
  
  Meanwhile, Paris is oddly silent. Even the opera singer has packed it in for the night. I cannot lose it. The walls here are thinner than Band-Aids, so if I break down, my neighbors—my new classmates—will hear everything. I’m going to be sick. I’m going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade I had for dinner, and everyone will hear, and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever it is people do here in their spare time.  
  
  I race to my pedestal sink to splash water on my face, but it explodes out and sprays my shirt instead. And now I’m crying harder, because I haven’t unpacked my towels, and wet clothing reminds me of those stupid water rides Bridgette and Matt used to drag me on at Six Flags where the water is the wrong color and it smells like paint and it has a billion trillion bacterial microbes in it. Oh God. What if there are bacterial microbes in the water? Is French water even safe to drink?  
  
  Pathetic. I’m pathetic.  
  
  How many seventeen-year-olds would kill to leave home? My neighbors aren’t experiencing any meltdowns. No crying coming from behind their bedroom walls. I grab a shirt off the bed to blot myself dry, when the solution strikes. My pillow. I collapse face-first into the sound barrier and sob and sob and sob.  
  
  Someone is knocking on my door.  
  
  No. Surely that’s not my door.  
  
  There it is again!  
  
  “Hello?” a girl calls from the hallway. “Hello? Are you okay?”  
  
  No, I’m not okay. GO AWAY. But she calls again, and I’m obligated to crawl off my bed and answer the door. A blonde with long, tight curls waits on the other side. She’s tall and big, but not overweight-big.Volleyball player big. A diamondlike nose ring sparkles in the hall light. “Are you all right?” Her voice is gentle. “I’m Meredith; I live next door. Were those your parents who just left?”  
  
  My puffy eyes signal the affirmative.  
  
  “I cried the first night, too.” She tilts her head, thinks for a moment, and then nods. “Come on. Chocolat chaud.”  
  
  “A chocolate show?” Why would I want to see a chocolate show? My mother has abandoned me and I’m terrified to leave my room and—  
  
  “No.” She smiles. “Chaud. Hot. Hot chocolate, I can make some in my room.”  
  
  Oh.  
  
  Despite myself, I follow. Meredith stops me with her hand like a crossing guard. She’s wearing rings on all five fingers. “Don’t forget your key. The doors automatically lock behind you.”  
  
  “I know.” And I tug the necklace out from underneath my shirt to prove it. I slipped my key onto it during this weekend’s required Life Skills Seminars for new students, when they told us how easy it is to get locked out.  
  
  We enter her room. I gasp. It’s the same impossible size as mine, seven by ten feet, with the same mini-desk, mini-dresser, mini-bed, mini-fridge, mini-sink, and mini-shower. (No mini-toilet, those are shared down the hall.) But . . . unlike my own sterile cage, every inch of wall and ceiling is covered with posters and pictures and shiny wrapping paper and brightly colored flyers written in French.  
  
  “How long have you been here?” I ask.  
  
  Meredith hands me a tissue and I blow my nose, a terrible honk like an angry goose, but she doesn’t flinch or make a face. “I arrived yesterday. This is my fourth year here, so I didn’t have to go to the seminars. I flew in alone, so I’ve just been hanging out, waiting for my friends to show up.” She looks around with her hands on her hips, admiring her handiwork. I spot a pile of magazines, scissors, and tape on her floor and realize it’s a work in progress. “Not bad, eh? White walls don’t do it for me.”  
  
  I circle her room, examining everything. I quickly discover that most of the faces are the same five people: John, Paul, George, Ringo, and some soccer guy I don’t recognize.  
  
  “The Beatles are all I listen to. My friends tease me, but—”  
  
  “Who’s this?” I point to Soccer Guy. He’s wearing red and white, and he’s all dark eyebrows and dark hair. Quite good-looking, actually.  
  
  “Cesc Fàbregas. God, he’s the most incredible passer. Plays for Arsenal. The English football club? No?”  
  
  I shake my head. I don’t keep up with sports, but maybe I should. “Nice legs, though.”  
  
  “I know, right? You could hammer nails with those thighs.”  
  
  While Meredith brews chocolat chaud on her hot plate, I learn she’s also a senior, and that she only plays soccer during the sum  
mer because our school doesn’t have a program, but that she used to rank All-State in Massachusetts. That’s where she’s from, Boston. And she reminds me I should call it “football” here, which—when I think about it—really does make more sense. And she doesn’t seem to mind when I badger her with questions or paw through her things.  
  
  Her room is amazing. In addition to the paraphernalia taped to her walls, she has a dozen china teacups filled with plastic glitter rings, and silver rings with amber stones, and glass rings with pressed flowers. It already looks as if she’s lived here for years.  
  
  I try on a ring with a rubber dinosaur attached. The T-rex flashes red and yellow and blue lights when I squeeze him. “I wish I could have a room like this.” I love it, but I’m too much of a neat freak to have something like it for myself. I need clean walls and a clean desktop and everything put away in its right place at all times.  
  
  Meredith looks pleased with the compliment.  
  
  “Are these your friends?” I place the dinosaur back into its teacup and point to a picture tucked in her mirror. It’s gray and shadowy and printed on thick, glossy paper. Clearly the product of a school photography class. Four people stand before a giant hollow cube, and the abundance of stylish black clothing and deliberately mussed hair reveals Meredith belongs to the resident art clique. For some reason, I’m surprised. I know her room is artsy, and she has all of those rings on her fingers and in her nose, but the rest is clean-cut—lilac sweater, pressed jeans, soft voice. Then there’s the soccer thing, but she’s not a tomboy either.  
  
  She breaks into a wide smile, and her nose ring winks. “Yeah. Ellie took that at La Défense. That’s Josh and St. Clair and me and Rashmi. You’ll meet them tomorrow at breakfast. Well, everyone but Ellie. She graduated last year.”  
  
  The pit of my stomach begins to unclench. Was that an invitation to sit with her?  
  
  “But I’m sure you’ll meet her soon enough, because she’s dating St. Clair. She’s at Parsons Paris now for photography.  I’ve never heard of it, but I nod as if I’ve considered going there myself someday.  
  
  “She’s really talented.” The edge in her voice suggests otherwise, but I don’t push it. “Josh and Rashmi are dating, too,” she adds.  
  
  Ah. Meredith must be single.  
  
  Unfortunately, I can relate. Back home I’d dated my friend Matt for five months. He was tall-ish and funny-ish and had decent-ish hair. It was one of those “since no one better is around, do you wanna make out?” situations. All we’d ever done was kiss, and it wasn’t even that great.Too much spit. I always had to wipe off my chin.  
  
  We broke up when I learned about France, but it wasn’t a big deal. I didn’t cry or send him weepy emails or key his mom’s station wagon. Now he’s going out with Cherrie Milliken, who is in chorus and has shiny shampoo-commercial hair. It doesn’t even bother me.  
  
  Not really.  
  
  Besides, the breakup freed me to lust after Toph, multiplex coworker babe extraordinaire. Not that I didn’t lust after him when I was with Matt, but still. It did make me feel guilty. And things were starting to happen with Toph—they really were—when summer ended. But Matt’s the only guy I’ve ever gone out with, and he barely counts. I once told him I’d dated this guy named Stuart Thistleback at summer camp. Stuart Thistleback had auburn hair and played the stand-up bass, and we were totally in love, but he lived in Chattanooga and we didn’t have our driver’s licenses yet.  
  
  Matt knew I made it up, but he was too nice to say so.  
  
  I’m about to ask Meredith what classes she’s taking, when her phone chirps the first few bars of “Strawberry Fields Forever.” She rolls her eyes and answers. “Mom, it’s midnight here. Six-hour time difference, remember?”  
  
  I glance at her alarm clock, shaped like a yellow submarine, and I’m surprised to find she’s right. I set my long-empty mug of chocolat chaud on her dresser. “I should get going,” I whisper. “Sorry I stayed so long.”  
  
  “Hold on a sec.” Meredith covers the mouthpiece. “It was nice meeting you. See you at breakfast?”  
  
  “Yeah. See ya.” I try to say this casually, but I’m so thrilled that I skip from her room and promptly slam into a wall.  
  
  Whoops. Not a wall. A boy.  
  
  “Oof.” He staggers backward.  
  
  “Sorry! I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you were there.”  
  
  He shakes his head, a little dazed.The first thing I notice is his hair—it’s the first thing I notice about everyone. It’s dark brown and messy and somehow both long and short at the same time. I think of the Beatles, since I’ve just seen them in Meredith’s room. It’s artist hair. Musician hair. I-pretend-I-don’t-care-but-I-really-do hair.  
  
  Beautiful hair.  
  
  “It’s okay, I didn’t see you either. Are you all right, then?”  
  
  Oh my. He’s English.  
  
  “Er. Does Mer live here?”  
  
  Seriously, I don’t know any American girl who can resist an English accent.  
  
  The boy clears his throat. “Meredith Chevalier? Tall girl? Big, curly hair?” Then he looks at me like I’m crazy or half deaf, like my Nanna Oliphant. Nanna just smiles and shakes her head whenever I ask, “What kind of salad dressing would you like?” or “Where did you put Granddad’s false teeth?”  
  
  “I’m sorry.” He takes the smallest step away from me. “You were going to bed.”  
  
  “Yes! Meredith lives there. I’ve just spent two hours with her.” I announce this proudly like my brother, Seany, whenever he finds something disgusting in the yard. “I’m Anna! I’m new here!” Oh God. What. Is with.The scary enthusiasm? My cheeks catch fire, and it’s all so humiliating.  
  
  The beautiful boy gives an amused grin. His teeth are lovely—straight on top and crooked on the bottom, with a touch of overbite. I’m a sucker for smiles like this, due to my own lack of orthodontia. I have a gap between my front teeth the size of a raisin.  
  
  “Étienne,” he says. “I live one floor up.”  
  
  “I live here.” I point dumbly at my room while my mind whirs: French name, English accent, American school. Anna confused.  
  
  He raps twice on Meredith’s door. “Well. I’ll see you around then, Anna.”  
  
  Eh-t-yen says my name like this: Ah-na.  
  
  My heart thump thump thumps in my chest.  
  
  Meredith opens her door. “St. Clair!” she shrieks. She’s still on the phone. They laugh and hug and talk over each other. “Come in! How was your flight? When’d you get here? Have you seen Josh? Mom, I’ve gotta go.”  
  
  Meredith’s phone and door snap shut simultaneously.  
  
  I fumble with the key on my necklace. Two girls in matching pink bathrobes strut behind me, giggling and gossiping. A crowd of guys across the hall snicker and catcall. Meredith and her friend laugh through the thin walls. My heart sinks, and my stomach tightens back up.  
  
  I’m still the new girl. I’m still alone.  
  
  chapter three  
  
  The next morning, I consider stopping by Meredith’s, but I chicken out and walk to breakfast by myself. At least I know where the cafeteria is (Day Two: Life Skills Seminars). I double-check for my meal card and pop open my Hello Kitty umbrella. It’s drizzling. The weather doesn’t give a crap that it’s my first day of school.  
  
  I cross the road with a group of chattering students.They don’t notice me, but together we dodge the puddles. An automobile, small enough to be one of my brother’s toys, whizzes past and sprays a girl in glasses. She swears, and her friends tease her.  
  
  I drop behind.  
  
  The city is pearl gray.The overcast sky and the stone buildings emit the same cold elegance, but ahead of me, the Panthéon shimmers. Its massive dome and impressive columns rise up to crown the top of the neighborhood. Every time I see it, it’s difficult to pull away. It’s as if it were stolen from ancient Rome or, at the very least, Capitol Hill. Nothing I should be able to view from a classroom window.  
  
  I don’t know its purpose, but I assume someone will tell me soon.  
  
  My new neighborhood is the Latin Quarter, or the fifth arrondissement. According to my pocket dictionary, that means district, and the buildings in my arrondissement blend one into another, curving around corners with the sumptuousness of wedding cakes.The sidewalks are crowded with students and tourists, and they’re lined with identical benches and ornate lampposts, bushy trees ringed in metal grates, Gothic cathedrals and tiny crêperies, postcard racks, and curlicue wrought iron balconies.  
  
  If this were a vacation, I’m sure I’d be charmed. I’d buy an Eiffel Tower key chain, take pictures of the cobblestones, and order a platter of escargot. But I’m not on vacation. I am here to live, and I feel small.  
  
  The School of America’s main building is only a two-minute walk from Résidence Lambert, the junior and senior dormitory. The entrance is through a grand archway, set back in a courtyard with manicured trees. Geraniums and ivy trail down from window boxes on each floor, and majestic lion’s heads are carved into the center of the dark green doors, which are three times my height. On either side of the doors hangs a red, white, and blue flag—one American, the other French.  
  
  It looks like a film set. A Little Princess, if it took place in Paris. How can such a school really exist? And how is it possible that I’m enrolled? My father is insane to believe I belong here. I’m struggling to close my umbrella and nudge open one of the heavy wooden doors with my butt, when a preppy guy with faux-surfer hair barges past. He smacks into my umbrella and then shoots me the stink-eye as if: (1) it’s my fault he has the patience of a toddler and (2) he wasn’t already soaked from the rain.  
  
  Two-point deduction for Paris. Suck on that, Preppy Guy.  
  
  The ceiling on the first floor is impossibly high, dripping with chandeliers and frescoed with flirting nymphs and lusting satyrs. It smells faintly of orange cleaning products and dry-erase markers. I follow the squeak of rubber soles toward the cafeteria. Beneath our feet is a marbled mosaic of interlocking sparrows. Mounted on the wall, at the far end of the hall, is a gilded clock that’s chiming  
the hour.  
  
  The whole school is as intimidating as it is impressive. It should be reserved for students with personal bodyguards and Shetland ponies, not someone who buys the majority of her wardrobe at Target.  
  
  Even though I saw it on the school tour, the cafeteria stops me dead. I used to eat lunch in a converted gymnasium that reeked of bleach and jockstraps. It had long tables with preattached benches, and paper cups and plastic straws.The hairnetted ladies who ran the cash registers served frozen pizza and frozen fries and frozen nuggets, and the soda fountains and vending machines provided the rest of my so-called nourishment.  
  
  But this. This could be a restaurant.  
  
  Unlike the historic opulence of the hall, the cafeteria is sleek and modern. It’s packed with round birch tables and plants in hanging baskets. The walls are tangerine and lime, and there’s a dapper Frenchman in a white chef’s hat serving a variety of food that looks suspiciously fresh. There are several cases of bottled drinks, but instead of high-sugar, high-caf colas, they’re filled with juice and a dozen types of mineral water. There’s even a table set up for coffee. Coffee. I know some Starbucks-starved students at Clairemont who’d kill for in-school coffee.  
  
  The chairs are already filled with people gossiping with their friends over the shouting of the chefs and the clattering of the dishes (real china, not plastic). I stall in the doorway. Students brush past me, spiraling out in all directions. My chest squeezes. Should I find a table or should I find breakfast first? And how am I even supposed to order when the menu is in freaking French?  
  
  I’m startled when a voice calls out my name. Oh please oh please oh please . . .  
  
  A scan through the crowd reveals a five-ringed hand waving from across the room. Meredith points to an empty chair beside her, and I weave my way there, grateful and almost painfully relieved.  
  
  “I thought about knocking on your door so we could walk together, but I didn’t know if you were a late sleeper.” Meredith’s eyebrows pinch together with worry. “I’m sorry, I should have [knocked.You](http://knocked.You) look so lost.”  
  
  “Thanks for saving me a spot.” I set down my stuff and take a seat.There are two others at the table and, as promised the night before, they’re from the photograph on her mirror. I’m nervous again and readjust my backpack at my feet.  
  
  “This is Anna, the girl I was telling you about,” Meredith says.  
  
  A lanky guy with short hair and a long nose salutes me with his coffee cup. “Josh,” he says. “And Rashmi.” He nods to the girl next to him, who holds his other hand inside the front pocket of his hoodie. Rashmi has blue-framed glasses and thick black hair that hangs all the way down her back. She gives me only the barest of acknowledgments.  
  
  That’s okay. No big deal.  
  
  “Everyone’s here except for St. Clair.” Meredith cranes her neck around the cafeteria. “He’s usually running late.”  
  
  “Always,” Josh corrects. “Always running late.”  
  
  I clear my throat. “I think I met him last night. In the hallway.”  
  
  “Good hair and an English accent?” Meredith asks.  
  
  “Um.Yeah. I guess.” I try to keep my voice casual.  
  
  Josh smirks. “Everyone’s in luuurve with St. Clair.”  
  
  “Oh, shut up,” Meredith says.  
  
  “I’m not.” Rashmi looks at me for the first time, calculating whether or not I might fall in love with her own boyfriend.  
  
  He lets go of her hand and gives an exaggerated sigh. “Well, I am. I’m asking him to prom. This is our year, I just know it.”  
  
  “This school has a prom?” I ask.  
  
  “God no,” Rashmi says. “Yeah, [Josh.You](http://Josh.You) and St. Clair would look really cute in matching tuxes.”  
  
  “Tails.” The English accent makes Meredith and me jump in our seats. Hallway boy. Beautiful boy. His hair is damp from the rain. “I insist the tuxes have tails, or I’m giving your corsage to Steve Carver instead.”  
  
  “St. Clair!” Josh springs from his seat, and they give each other the classic two-thumps-on-the-back guy hug.  
  
  “No kiss? I’m crushed, mate.”  
  
  “Thought it might miff the ol’ ball and chain. She doesn’t know about us yet.”  
  
  “Whatever,” Rashmi says, but she’s smiling now. It’s a good look for her. She should utilize the corners of her mouth more often.  
  
  Beautiful Hallway Boy (Am I supposed to call him Étienne or St. Clair?) drops his bag and slides into the remaining seat between Rashmi and me. “Anna.” He’s surprised to see me, and I’m startled, too. He remembers me.  
  
  “Nice umbrella. Could’ve used that this morning.” He shakes a hand through his hair, and a drop lands on my bare arm. Words fail me. Unfortunately, my stomach speaks for itself. His eyes pop at the rumble, and I’m alarmed by how big and brown they are. As if he needed any further weapons against the female race.  
  
  Josh must be right. Every girl in school must be in love with him.  
  
  “Sounds terrible. You ought to feed that thing. Unless ...” He pretends to examine me, then comes in close with a whisper. “Unless you’re one of those girls who never eats. Can’t tolerate that, I’m afraid. Have to give you a lifetime table ban.”  
  
  I’m determined to speak rationally in his presence. “I’m not sure how to order.”  
  
  “Easy,” Josh says. “Stand in line. Tell them what you want. Accept delicious goodies. And then give them your meal card and two pints of blood.”  
  
  “I heard they raised it to three pints this year,” Rashmi says.  
  
  “Bone marrow,” Beautiful Hallway Boy says. “Or your left earlobe.”  
  
  “I meant the menu, thank you very much.” I gesture to the chalkboard above one of the chefs. An exquisite, cursive hand has written out the morning’s menu in pink and yellow and white. In French. “Not exactly my first language.”  
  
  “You don’t speak French?” Meredith asks.  
  
  “I’ve taken Spanish for three years. It’s not like I ever thought I’d be moving to Paris.”  
  
  “It’s okay,” Meredith says quickly. “A lot of people here don’t speak French.”  
  
  “But most of them do,” Josh adds.  
  
  “But most of them not very well.” Rashmi looks pointedly at him.  
  
  “You’ll learn the language of food first. The language of love.” Josh rubs his belly like a skinny Buddha. “Oeuf. Egg. Pomme. Apple. Lapin. Rabbit.”  
  
  “Not funny.” Rashmi punches him in the arm. “No wonder Isis bites you. Jerk.”  
  
  I glance at the chalkboard again. It’s still in French. “And, um, until then?”  
  
  “Right.” Beautiful Hallway Boy pushes back his chair. “Come along, then. I haven’t eaten either.” I can’t help but notice several girls gaping at him as we wind our way through the crowd. A blonde with a beaky nose and a teeny tank top coos as soon as we get in line. “Hey, St. Clair. How was your summer?”  
  
  “Hallo, Amanda. Fine.”  
  
  “Did you stay here, or did you go back to London?” She leans over her friend, a short girl with a severe ponytail, and positions herself for maximum cleavage exposure.  
  
  “I stayed with me mum in San Francisco. Did you have a good holiday?” He asks this politely, but I’m pleased to hear the indifference in his voice.  
  
  Amanda flips her hair, and suddenly she’s Cherrie Milliken. Cherrie loves to swish her hair and shake it out and twirl it around her fingers. Bridgette is convinced she spends her weekends standing before oscillating fans, pretending to be a supermodel, but I think she’s too busy soaking her locks in seaweed papaya mud wraps in that never-ending quest for perfect sheen.  
  
  “It was fabulous.” Flip, goes her hair. “I went to Greece for a month, then spent the rest of my summer in Manhattan. My father has an amazing penthouse that overlooks Central Park.”  
  
  Every sentence she says has a word that’s emphasized. I snort to keep from laughing, and Beautiful Hallway Boy gets a strange coughing fit.  
  
  “But I missed you. Didn’t you get my emails?”  
  
  “Er, no. Must have the wrong address. Hey.” He nudges me  
. “It’s almost our turn.”He turns his back onAmanda,and she and her friend exchange frowns. “Time for your first French lesson. Breakfast here is simple and consists primarily of breads—croissants being the most famous, of course.This means no sausage, no scrambled eggs.”  
  
  “Bacon?” I ask hopefully.  
  
  “Definitely not.” He laughs. “Second lesson, the words on the chalkboard. Listen carefully and repeat after me. Granola.” I narrow my eyes as he widens his in mock innocence. “Means ‘granola,’ you see. And this one? Yaourt?”  
  
  “Gee, I dunno.Yogurt?”  
  
  “A natural!You say you’ve never lived in France before?”  
  
  “Har. Bloody. Har.”  
  
  He smiles. “Oh, I see. Known me less than a day and teasing me about my accent.What’s next? Care to discuss the state of my hair? My height? My trousers?”  
  
  Trousers. Honestly.  
  
  The Frenchman behind the counter barks at us. Sorry, Chef Pierre. I’m a little distracted by this English French American Boy Masterpiece. Said boy asks rapidly, “Yogurt with granola and honey, soft-boiled egg, or pears on brioche?”  
  
  I have no idea what brioche is. “Yogurt,” I say.  
  
  He places our orders in perfect French. At least, it sounds impeccable to my virgin ears, and it relaxes Chef Pierre. He loses the glower and stirs the granola and honey into my yogurt. A sprinkling of blueberries is added to the top before he hands it over.  
  
  “Merci, Monsieur Boutin.”  
  
  I grab our tray. “No Pop-Tarts? No Cocoa Puffs? I’m, like, totally offended.”  
  
  “Pop-Tarts are Tuesdays, Eggo waffles are Wednesdays, but they never, ever serve Cocoa Puffs. You shall have to settle for Froot Loops Fridays instead.”  
  
  “You know a lot about American junk food for a British dude.”  
  
  “Orange juice? Grapefruit? Cranberry?” I point to the orange, and he pulls two out of the case. “I’m not British. I’m American.”  
  
  I smile. “Sure you are.”  
  
  “I am. You have to be an American to attend SOAP, remember?”  
  
  “Soap?”  “School of America in Paris,” he explains. “SOAP.  Nice. My father sent me here to be cleansed.

1la5c30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUS/comments/1la5c30/inflation_vs_deflation_which_is_worse/,"Inflation vs Deflation, which is worse?","**Hey fellow Americans,**

Let's set politics aside for a moment and dive into some economic thoughts. One of Trump's key goals is tackling inflation in the US, and he seems dissatisfied with Powell, who prioritizes adjusting interest rates based on inflation and employment data.

As a Chinese citizen, it's a starkly different situation here. Since the pandemic, prices have been dropping year after year, including salaries for some individuals and the real estates' listings. This trend has left me feeling increasingly uncertain based on recent experiences:

1. I recently purchased a shovel for just 0.1 USD, delivery included.
2. During the recent competition among major delivery companies, you could order coffee or bubble tea for as low as 0.2 USD or less. 

While promotions play a role in the aforementioned cases, it's becoming common to find items priced under 0.5 USD with free delivery. Clearly, China is currently grappling with deflation. The question is, which economic challenge—deflation in China or inflation in the US—is potentially more concerning in the **long term**?

What are your thoughts?

Brush your teeth? Wash your face. Make your coffee? Apply serum while it brews.

# 2. Keep your products visible and accessible

Out of sight, out of mind. Keep your skincare next to your toothbrush or coffee mug.

# 3. Use multi-tasking products

Bundles that include masks with collagen, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C help you get multiple benefits in one session.

# 4. Create a “skincare soundtrack”

Make a playlist or podcast that lasts the same length as your routine, it trains your brain to look forward to the process.

# 5. Track your progress with photos or journaling

Nothing builds a habit like seeing results. Try snapping a pic every Sunday night.

1la56p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1la56p6/my_new_job/,My new Job,"When I started working the graveyard shift at the local convenience store, I was just looking for a paycheck. But they didn’t hand me a uniform first. They handed me a list of rules.

No one explained them. My manager just said:
“Follow these. Don’t ask questions. If you screw up, you’ll know why.”
He smiled like he was joking, but his eyes weren’t laughing.

Here’s the list. I keep a copy in my back pocket. If you're ever unlucky enough to cover a night shift here, you'll want to do the same.

Rule One: The Man in the Black Suit
If a man in a black suit enters at 1:34 AM, and you cannot make out his face—even if nothing is covering it—go into the back room and lock the door.

Don’t come out until you hear the doorbell chime again.

Don’t try to peek.
Don’t try to take a picture.
Just wait.

Rule Two: The Red Slurpee
If the Slurpee machine starts dispensing a dark red mixture, stop everything.

Hang an “Out of Order” sign on the entire machine—not just the red nozzle.

Get the red-labeled bucket from under the sink (marked “Red Slurpee”).

Cycle the machine into the bucket until it returns to a normal color.

Keep cycling for two full buckets afterward, just to be safe.

If anyone drinks the dark red Slurpee:

Offer them anything to keep them in the store.

Remain calm.

Use the black phone in the back room.

Dial 10711 followed by the store number (for example: 1072110798).

Say: ""Red Slurpee.""

Then follow every single instruction they give you.

Rule Three: Trash Time
Never take out the trash between 1:30 AM and 3:45 AM.
I tell the new hires 2 to 4 AM, just to be safe.

Rule Four: The CDC Guy
If someone from the CDC shows up with no paperwork, and it's not Sunday, tell him you don’t want the delivery.

It’s not milk.
It’s not donuts.
It’s not sandwiches.
It’s not safe.

Rule Five: The Little Girl
Sometimes a little girl shows up alone, usually quiet.

Let her pick what candy she wants.
Do not charge her.

There’s petty cash in the drawer under Register One.
Print a receipt, sign it, and place it in the box beside the cash.

Don’t tell the manager.
They already know.
They never talk about her during the day.

Rule Six: The Vault
Restock the walk-in beverage cooler whenever needed. But remember:

Items are never in the same place twice.

If you need to exit, only leave through the same door you entered.

If you exit a different door, go back in, then leave through the original entrance.

Never take anything with you if you used the wrong door.

Ignore any voices or people on the other side.

They are not customers.
They are not safe.

Rule Seven: The Emergency Outside
If someone runs in screaming for help and begs you to go outside with them:

Do not go.

Tell them you’ll call the police.
If they insist, go into the back and use the black phone again.

Dial 10712 plus your store number.

Say: ""Emergency Outside.""

Follow instructions.

When you hang up, do not return to the front of the store until the black phone rings.

Answer it. The voice will say a code phrase.

For this store, it’s:

“Breakfast Bite, Potato Split Top Bun.”

That’s your sign it’s safe again.
Don’t answer any other phones.

Rule Eight: The Coffee
7-Eleven always keeps coffee fresh.

Back when we had glass pots, it was every 15 minutes. Now it’s 3 hours max with the new system.

If you have the instant brewer:
Never let it run out of beans.

You don’t want to know what happens if it does.

Rule Nine: Pump 1
At exactly 3:33 AM, if a man comes in asking for $6.65 on Pump 1, and gives you a $100 bill:

Take it.

Place the change and signed receipt into the box under Register One.

This helps fund the little girl’s candy.

Don’t ask questions. Just do it.

Rule Ten: The Money
There’s a reason we’re picky about money handling.

If someone asks you to load a card over the phone, hang up.

If a customer tells you to keep a tip, you may keep it.

If someone leaves change and says nothing, print a receipt, sign it, and put it under Register Two.

If you find money that shouldn’t be there, and you haven’t had a customer in a while, put it in the Register Two box with a note:

Amount

Register time (not the wall clock)

The manager will handle it.

He always does.

That’s the list.
I’ve followed every rule.
Some of my coworkers didn’t.

They don’t work here anymore.

Hell… some of them probably aren’t anywhere anymore.

If you get the night shift, don’t screw around.
Don’t play hero.
Don’t test it.

Just follow the rules.

And whatever you do…

Don’t drink the red Slurpee.

1la4wip,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakewood/comments/1la4wip/all_these_coffee_shops_but_no_vibes_rant/,All these coffee shops but no vibes. [rant],"Friends, neighbors, what are we doing here? The west side of Lakewood has so many coffee shops and somehow they're all bad. A girl just wants to work on her fanfics in a cute little coffee shop with a matcha and a pastry. Is that too much to ask? Here's the rundown:

* Propaganda
   * Honestly not bad for Lakewood but not cozy at all.
   * There simply HAS to be a better way to arrange the seating, they could fit twice the tables in there and make better use of their gorgeous windows. Maybe even booths?
   * Drinks are good at least and the staff is nice.
* Burning River Coffee
   * Nothing kills the vibe like a clumsy armchair. And also looking face-to-face with an 18 year old who vaped his brain into mush from across the store because this place is also a literal smoke shop.
   * Enough with the ""instagram pastries"". They're not good!
* Brewella's
   * So close to greatness but it's always slammed every time I've gone.
   * Cramped as heck (despite the fact that they could add double the tables.)
   * DARK! It's kind of okay in the winter nights but during the day they always have stuff blocking their big beautiful windows. The whole place feels more like a dive than a coffee shop.
* The Blue Cafe
   * The vibe here is downright SINISTER
   * Mismatched color temp lightbulbs, a weird black couch. BLUE NEON? And oppressively bright can lights in that weird back room. 
   * It's somehow too dark and too bright all at once.
* Goodkind
   * Perfect in nearly every way except they will kick you out for having a laptop on the weekend. If you want to sit and chat, it's a really good spot. If you want to study or plan a getaway with your girls or write Dramione fanfic, this is NOT THE PLACE. A real shame.
   * They allow laptops during weekdays but it's the same 10 people who park there for the entire day so good luck getting a seat.
   * Are they ever going to expand into that vacant storefront they're attached to?
   * Vegan options are good at least.
* Root
   * The baristas are mean.
   * Why is everything sticky?
   * I can't give them too much crap, they have a lot of local artists featured, a community pantry, and tons of seating. Unlike Goodkind, they care about the ARTS \[ho hum!\]
   * It's actually maybe the best spot in Lakewood if they weren't so frickin mean. Lots of characters come in and out if you like to people-watch.
* Starbucks
   * Someone tell me why the frickin Starbucks is better than most of the locally owned little coffee shops in town? That's not how it's supposed to be.
   * Baristas are all super nice despite having objectively the worst clientele.
   * What is going on with the seating in this place? Each table is a mile apart from the other. It feels so poorly utilized. 
   * SO MUCH LIGHT!
* Caffeine
   * They hate you and the drinks are bad.
   * Someone walked into H&M and said ""I wish they sold coffee here.""
   * Not a good seat in the entire place.
* La Mocha (Not west, but I go there sometimes)
   * I want to like this place but the seating is sub-par for trying to do any kind of focused work and it's always full of artificial light. Vibes are so off.
   * Not a huge fan of the sugary drinks, especially if I'm trying to lock in.
   * They do artist events though which we must stan.
* Roasted (Not west, but I go there sometimes)
   * Okay on this one, I have to admit, the vibes and coffee are good. It's just so far east from me, I don't usually go there
   * If Lakewood would ever actually commit to protected bike lanes on Madison, maybe I'd go more. \[grrr\]

TL;DR: There's no vibey coffee shops on the west side of Lakewood without some horrible fatal flaw. I feel like we can do better. We can learn about color temperature and feng shui. We can acknowledge the value in making spaces that feel welcoming and cozy. We can commit to making our establishments places people *want* to be, spaces that attract artists and friend groups and families. 

I may have indulged myself in roasting all of these coffee shops, but I think my criticism of them stands. There are so few third spaces that aren't bars in this city. With a little TLC \[and some better attitudes from *some of you*\], I think all of these places could become something great.

Why did I go? 

Because I was sitting there coding one day and the thought randomly popped into my head ""What if I went to a hackathon?"" One google later badaboom badabing.

 I thought it would be a massive hall with hundreds of sweaty programmers, and since the theme was data science and I'm relatively new to coding, I was pretty worried about whether I'd be useful at all. But I said fuck it, I'll just go alone and try to represent the frontend developer army.

Turns out it was way smaller - about 15 people total. We worked on solutions to Dublin-specific issues. My team tackled traffic problems and the city's over-reliance on cars, while other teams focused on things like the homelessness crisis. We were split into 3 teams total.

**Funny thing:** I actually showed up a day early by mistake because I misread the email. Classic.

The people there had really diverse skill sets, which was reassuring since I'm relatively new to coding. I was worried I wouldn't be able to keep up, but I learned that having thinkers and leaders on teams is just as important as having programmers. Even without tons of experience, there's definitely a place for you.

I was also expecting it to suck based on all the online horror stories about people going to hackathons alone and having terrible times. But honestly, I'm pretty extroverted and social, so going solo wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. Not sure how more introverted people would handle it, but for me it worked out fine.

# My Team Was... Interesting

One girl basically sat down, ignored the rest of us, developed her own app, then left before we presented. She seemed talented but was clearly just there for herself - maybe trying to advance her career, which is fair I guess.

Then there was me, who ended up sort of overseeing the whole project because everyone kept working independently without communicating. I had to sync everything together every couple hours.

The other 3 were data scientists and they were all lovely people. The hardest part was coming up with a creative solution - if I did it again, I'd definitely think of something better.

# Our Solution

We expanded on the Irish government's current idea about transport hubs where people can rent bikes, scooters, or e-cars. But instead of adding e-cars, we suggested focusing on getting people to actually use the bikes and scooters we already have, since our research showed people are just choosing not to use existing facilities.

The solo girl did develop a pretty cool app to visualize the best areas for transport hubs though.

# The Event Itself

Was supposed to be 9am to 9pm but really ended around 5pm, which I was slightly disappointed about since I wanted the full hackathon experience. In hindsight though, it was perfect for a first-timer.

They had snacks throughout (both healthy and sugary options), pizza after presentations, and a little awards show where every team got an award. There was even a professional photographer for LinkedIn posts and social media.

The workspace was really impressive - big, colorful, clean, with plenty of charging stations and presentation areas. I was genuinely surprised something like this was happening in Dublin, especially since I only found out about it by chance. There was a cute little award ceremony where every team got an award which was nice. In fact the whole event was very low stakes and non competitive. Just good vibes and co-operation. 

The solo dev girl who ditched us ended up coming back just in time to collect the trophy, take photos for linkedin, and leave. LOL

# What You'd Need for a Hackathon

* Open mind
* Good understanding of your own skills
* Creative thinking
* Laptop (tablet at worst)
* Water bottle
* Stretch well before/during/after - you'll be hunched over a desk for hours

One teammate brought a laptop raiser which seemed like a smart move. Coffee was provided so no need to bring caffeine.

Overall, really glad I went. Definitely planning to do more of these. 

I wrote this because this was probably one of the more valuable experiences on my dev journey so far and it’s likely to be valuable to you also if you’re anything like me. 

So if you’re on the fence like I was, don’t be. Most of the people there are just trying to connect and are likely good natured. As long as you’re not a complete weirdo you’ll probably have a good time.

1la4u5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentrelinkOz/comments/1la4u5c/centrelink_correctly_outsourced_income_support_to/,"Centrelink ""correctly"" outsourced income support to my partner — please help with the ""financial abuse"" police statement","Disclaimer: 

I have made this post long because certain others won't think through their reflexive responses. I have done this thinking for them! You're welcome.

Post:

I will make the bold assumption that the flood of replies I received to my previous posts on Centrelink's Partner Test alleging ""financial abuse"" were in good faith, had my best interests in heart and were not — banish the thought! — lazy moralising or punching down. That's what they want to discuss, so I'm creating this post for them.

Let's humour the idea that Centrelink was right to cut off my income, resulting in my obvious hardship, and that my partner's lack of ""dependent maintenance"" to me is financial abuse. I'm giving these people the chance to put their money where their mouth is.

Brief context:

I have a disability that doesn't allow me to work enough to support myself financially. (Yes, I have explored WFH options and bootstrapping, thank you!) My partner does not fund my life, despite Centrelink's obviously reasonable assumption that she must. She lives on a modest income. We've always kept finances separate. She works so hard in 12 hour shifts that sometimes, as soon as she gets home, she passes out in her bed with the light on. She also has her own financial obligations, which would make the financial sacrifice of funding me doubly onerous and probably immiserating. Let's assume she's entitled to a future that isn't bleak — it's only fair.

I can only imagine her (non?) resentment at busting herself at work while she hands over coffee money and other leisure money for me to enjoy myself with.

I assume these people worried about ""financial abuse"" would expect something more than mere survival and subsistence on a permanent basis for both of us — no classism or ableism involved!

Caveat:

It could be argued that a single-income couple isn't the norm in 2025 — even with one member earning significantly more. A cost of living crisis makes such a prospect frightening. An onerous financial obligation imposed on the earning member will stress test the couple and see if love really does conquer all. I would hazard a guess that many otherwise committed couples would fold under such pressure or are damaged significantly, possibly with the potential for abuse.

De facto might be considered a narrow and arbitrary category Centrelink imposes on us in order to create financial obligation. You could call the couple we are something else to recognise that we are otherwise committed but resent the financial obligation.

Having my financial autonomy taken away is fine, because I made the error of needing income support, apparently. So if I need to grovel for spending money for treats from my partner, this is only fair.

Lastly, the financial abuse would be removed if Centrelink changed its mind and decided to recognise me as single for the purpose of payment.

I love my partner and would not leave her willingly, except under duress, which Centrelink is imposing on me.

The police charge:

So it has been established that my partner is financially abusive, despite the above. I was without income for two months, resulting in enormous hardship. Even when I work to the full extent of my ability, I don't have nearly enough to be financially stable. The family support I have had to resort to has caused enormous stress to the family member helping out and is not sustainable. The financial precarity has pushed my mental health to the brink questioning what value my life has and why I should keep on going.

By not fulfilling her expected role, she is ""financially abusing"" me. Help me write the police statement and a brief for a subsequent court case. Make sure it's believable enough so that others won't laugh in my face.

""Officer, I am a financial pet of my partner, per Centrelink's decision for her to fund my life. She won't bust herself at work and gladly hand over coffee money for me. I can't work enough to provide for myself and expect her to accommodate my financial needs because 'love conquers all' and she is my true partner. She should make a massive sacrifice by accepting her role as my new income support — but she won't. This is abuse! I demand that you arrest her and throw her in prison. I mean, we even fold laundry together and she says she cares about me. This proves she is a liar and an abuser!

She has less rights than other people because she was born overseas. Please take that into account and be ruthless!""

Dear Neighbors, Artists, Business Owners, and Community Leaders,
I've recently moved to this town and have come to appreciate the quiet strength, history, and
potential in our community. As I walk downtown, I see the bones of a beautiful story that deserves to
be told-and shared.
We live in a place with rich roots, from its logging past to the small businesses working hard to grow
something meaningful here. And yet, many of our walls remain bare. There is little graffiti, little color,
and little visual representation of who we are-or who we're becoming.
But I believe we have artists here-brilliant ones-whose work is waiting to be seen. I've met a few
quietly practicing in studios, garages, and kitchens. I believe our walls could become canvases for
that creativity, giving life to our stories, attracting visitors, and supporting our local economy in the
process.
Here's the idea: Imagine a community-wide art competition, held in our coffee shops, restaurants,
and gathering spaces. Artists from across the region could submit work in categories like heritage,
youth, environment, identity, and imagination. Winners would be awarded the chance to paint a
mural on one of our town's blank downtown walls.
This wouldn't just be about art. It would be about pride. It would be about small business. It would be
about creating places where people want to gather, take photos, eat, explore, and return to. Every
mural would be a new reason to visit-and to stay.
I don't have a full plan or a formal position. I'm just someone who cares and had an idea. If you think

something like this is worth doing, I hope this letter finds its way into the right hands.
If you're an artist, business owner, teacher, parent, student, council member, or simply someone
who wants to help make this place more vibrant-reach out. Take this idea and make it your own.
Let's see what it becomes.
Sincerely,

We know it’s been quiet recently, and we want to acknowledge that. Our silence hasn’t been from neglect, but from navigating a particularly complex phase in Spinn’s journey.

Rest assured that Spinn is operating and we stand by our no questions asked refund policy. We have had a major shift in the support department, which has slowed things up temporarily, but we are getting things back up to speed and truly appreciate your patience during these adjustments.

We are fully committed to fulfilling every pre-order and continuing to evolve the Spinn platform.
In recent months, we’ve faced several macroeconomic and industry-wide challenges. From rising material and manufacturing costs, to shifting trade conditions, these external pressures have added friction to our timeline, but not to our mission.
Spinn is still here, and we are still building. We’re adjusting plans and executing thoughtfully to ensure long-term sustainability, while also protecting the experience you’ve signed up for.

What We’re Doing:
To ensure we continue delivering value to our customers, we’ve taken a number of steps to optimize operations:
We’ve focused resources on core production and support functions.
We’re in the process of expanding operational partnerships to increase flexibility and output.
We’re continuing to strengthen our financial position to support scale-up and delivery planning.
None of this has been easy, but every decision is being made with the long-term health of Spinn and the satisfaction of our customers in mind.

What You Can Expect:
Here’s what we can commit to right now:
Spinn 2 is still in motion
Every machine pre-ordered remains in our delivery plan.
Support for Spinn V1 continues
Including parts, maintenance, and service.
More regular updates moving forward, even brief ones, so you’re never left in the dark.
A delivery update will be shared as soon as our next phase is locked in. 
Why We’re Committed:
Spinn has always been about more than just coffee, it’s about innovation, community, and building something better together.
Many of our customers have been with us through every generation.
You’ve helped shape this journey, and we’re determined to honor that commitment.
We’ve overcome a lot over the past decade, from global chip shortages to tariff swings to early-stage production pivots.
Every time, we’ve kept going. This time is no different.

Looking Ahead:
We expect to share more clarity on our next delivery milestone in the coming days. Behind the scenes, our small but mighty team is focused, motivated, and determined. Your patience and support are not just appreciated, they are the reason we’re still here, fighting for this vision.
If you’re waiting on a response or support ticket, please know we’re catching up. If you’ve pre-ordered, you are not forgotten, you are the future of Spinn.
 
Thank you again for your belief in us. We’re honored to have you with us and excited for what’s ahead.

Ok, I tried last night about one of my two white whale books I can't find from my childhood and got the answer in literally less than 15 minutes. So, let's try the other.

This was in the early 90's, had to be prior to 95' or 96' for sure. Same time frame as the other book which turned out to have come out in 93'.

It was a collection of stories about cats.

There was one story I remember fairly well. Though I may have details wrong bc I did on the other one. There is a girl at all girls school. She only has one friend. She hates the main teacher who runs the school. The girl has the really nice corner room. She feeds this stray cat outside her window. She loves him. She has a radio she likes as well. Over the course of the story things start going missing including the radio and the cat. She knows it is the headmistress. She knows she hurt the cat. She gets into a huge fight with her and the headmistress is playing coy like she knows nothing of what she is speaking about.

The girl starts fully freaking out and she falls over the coffee table or something and skewers herself on a like spear or something. I don't know, she does accidentally. After her death we start to see the headmistress really did not have any idea about what she was upset about and is quite shaken up. The friend is also super upset. The headmistress wants to help her through this tough time and asks if there is anything she can do. The friend says she would like to move into the corner room in order to be closer to the memories of her friend.

Headmistress agrees so friend goes and starts packing. She stops crying when she gets to her room opens the closet and pulls out a radio, several other objects that were the friends, and a black trash bag with a dead cat in it. She is going to dispose of them and then move into the room she wanted.

It is the only story I remember at all.",1,1749781323.0,tipofmytongue,5,1.0,False
