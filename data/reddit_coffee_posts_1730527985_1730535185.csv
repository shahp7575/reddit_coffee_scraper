- Client wants to livestream from a coffee shop (long story) but I don‚Äôt want to use their public WiFi at all
- Client already has a StreamYard pro account and wants to use that to push out to all of his channels which he‚Äôs done many times before but hasn‚Äôt done anything to this scale and doesn‚Äôt want to get caught up in the nitty gritty of setup, production, etc when he‚Äôs going to be the main host in front of the camera‚Ä¶so hence he asked me
- I‚Äôm comfortable using basic livestream equipment like the Yolobox Pro since it‚Äôs simple to use but I assume to use StreamYard I have to use a computer instead? And no Yolobox
- Client also wants to stream for 2 hours straight (yes‚Ä¶2 hours) and ALSO have guests come in person AND via StreamYard 

I‚Äôll be providing and running all the lighting, cameras, audio‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs the streaming part I‚Äôm not confident on.  I assume I‚Äôll need a good computer running Chrome (to use StreamYard) but how do I get a really reliable internet connection for that whole time, a hotspot? If so, which one? Carrier, rough guess on data?

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",1,1730534589.0,ParallelUniverse,0,1.0,False

1ghretp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ghretp,"Strive Coffee - San Isidro, Talisay  City ","Its such a rarity for me grab some coffee in the south since I am from the city proper. Today is an exemption since we detoured our way to Strive Coffee after our Lechon Lunch in Carcar. My classmate recommended me to try Strive Coffee and I had a spectacular experience with it. 

Strive Coffee is not your typical cafe wherein they place an emphasis more on its aesthetic than their coffee offerings quality. This cafe displays the antithesis of a cafe's norms because they serve great coffee with an aesthetic ambiance. 

What I ordered:

White Oat Latte - (4.5/5); This coffee tasted divine because they used Yardstick coffee beans. However, it was a bit sweet for me and my mom's liking. I love the combination of cream and condensed milk mixed into the espresso that paired well with the oatmilk. It is somehow pricey but lo and behold they use Yardstick beans which makes it worth every penny.

Ratings:

Service - (4.5/5); Since it is a holiday and there is only one barista, service was quite sluggish. What made up for the sluggish service was the barista's cordial attitude towards me as she answered all of my queries as a first-timer.

Ambience - (5/5); I love how sleek and squeaky clean the place is and its conduciveness for studying. It's hayag but not irritating for the eyes.

Willingness to come back - (5/5); I will come back here after my south of Cebu trips as a detour since you need to drive a car to drop by. I will also go back because they use Yardstick beans, the one of the best coffee beans in the Philippines.

Price - (4.5/5); It is understandable why their prices are quite high its because their beans are sourced from Manila, aka Yardstick. You get what you pay for and its poetic justice.

Location - (3/5); It would depend if you are from the City, North or South. For me, its not commute-friendly and you need to get here by car. Nevertheless, when we find for gems like Strive, we find our ways to come here no matter how arduous the journey is.

Overall, I highly recommend Strive Cafe as your cafes to drop by in Talisay. ",6,1730533483.0,CebuRestaurantReviews,0,1.0,False

","I'd always been fascinated by the mysteries of the cosmos, so when I saw him at the astronomy convention, I knew I had to meet him. He was tall, with a lean, muscular build, and eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of the universe. His name was Orion, and he was an astrophysicist with a passion for the unexplained.

""You're new here,"" he said, approaching me at the coffee stand. ""I don't think I've seen you before.""

""First time,"" I replied, smiling. ""I'm Jane. I'm just here to learn.""

""Well, Jane, I'd be happy to teach you a thing or two,"" he said, his voice deep and velvety.

We spent the afternoon talking about black holes and supernovas, our hands brushing occasionally, sending electric jolts through my body. By the time the convention ended, we were both feeling the chemistry.

""Would you like to grab dinner?"" he asked. ""There's a great place nearby that serves the best martinis in the city.""

I nodded, feeling a thrill of anticipation. ""I'd love to.""

Over dinner, we shared our dreams and fears. I told him about my fascination with UFOs and alien encounters, and he shared his theories about interdimensional travel. The conversation flowed easily, and the sexual tension was palpable.

As we walked back to my car, he took my hand. ""You know, Jane, I have something I'd like to show you.""

""Oh yeah?"" I said, my heart pounding. ""What's that?""

""It's a surprise,"" he said, a mischievous glint in his eye. ""But I promise, it's out of this world.""

He led me to his car, a sleek black Tesla. Inside, it was like a spaceship, with a dashboard that lit up like a starry night. As we drove, he told me about his obsession with zero gravity and his desire to experience it for himself.

""I've built something in my garage,"" he said. ""A device that can simulate zero gravity. It's... intense.""

I bit my lip, feeling a rush of excitement. ""I'd love to see it.""

His house was a modern glass and steel structure, nestled in the hills overlooking the city. Inside, it was like a museum of space artifacts, with meteorites and moon rocks on display. But the real showstopper was in the garage: a massive, cylindrical device that looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.

""What is it?"" I asked, my eyes wide with wonder.

""It's a zero-g chamber,"" he said, grinning. ""And it's fully operational.""

He explained how it worked, how the centrifugal force would push us to the walls, creating the sensation of zero gravity. I felt a rush of adrenaline and anticipation.

""So, what do you say?"" he asked. ""Ready to take a ride?""

I nodded, my heart pounding. ""Let's do it.""

We climbed into the chamber, which was padded and comfortable. Orion started the machine, and gradually, we began to float. It was an incredible sensation, like nothing I'd ever experienced before. We laughed and played, our bodies entwining as we bumped and spun through the air.

Suddenly, he was on top of me, his body pinning mine to the wall. ""You're mine now,"" he said, his voice low and commanding. ""Mine to do with as I please.""

I felt a shiver of excitement. ""Yes,"" I whispered. ""Do with me what you will.""

He kissed me, his tongue exploring my mouth. I moaned, my body responding to his touch. He unbuttoned my shirt, his hands roaming over my skin, leaving trails of fire. I arched my back, offering myself to him.

""You're so responsive,"" he murmured, his lips moving down my neck. ""I can't wait to see what else you can do.""

He unbuttoned my jeans, sliding them down my legs. I kicked them off, floating naked in the chamber. He looked at me, his eyes dark with desire.

""You're beautiful,"" he said. ""But I want to see you squirm.""

He reached into a compartment on the wall and pulled out a strange, tentacle-like device. It was made of a soft, flexible material, and it glowed with a faint blue light.

""What's that?"" I asked, my eyes wide.

""A little something I picked up on my travels,"" he said, a wicked grin on his face. ""It's designed to stimulate... certain areas.""

He turned it on, and the tentacles began to move, writhing and pulsing. He placed it against my clit, and I gasped as the sensation hit me. It was intense, unlike anything I'd ever felt before.

""Oh god,"" I moaned, my hips bucking against the device. ""That feels amazing.""

He smiled, his eyes never leaving mine. ""Just wait,"" he said. ""It gets better.""

He turned up the intensity, and the tentacles began to move faster, penetrating me deeper. I cried out, my body convulsing with pleasure.

""You like that, don't you?"" he said, his voice low and commanding. ""You like being fucked by my little alien friend.""

""Yes,"" I gasped. ""God, yes.""

He took my wrists, pinning them above my head. ""Now, I want you to come for me,"" he said. ""Come all over my tentacles.""

I moaned, my body tensing as the orgasm washed over me. It was intense, almost overwhelming, and I cried out as the waves of pleasure crashed through me.

When I finally opened my eyes, he was looking at me, a satisfied smile on his face. ""Good girl,"" he said. ""Now, it's my turn.""

He unzipped his pants, his cock springing free. It was hard and throbbing, and I licked my lips, eager to taste him.

""Suck it,"" he said, his voice commanding. ""Suck my cock like a good little alien slave.""

I took him in my mouth, moaning as I felt him grow harder. He groaned, his hands tangling in my hair.

""That's it,"" he said, his hips moving, fucking my mouth. ""Take it all. Take every inch.""

I gagged as he hit the back of my throat, but I didn't stop. I wanted to please him, to make him come just like he'd made me.

""Fuck,"" he groaned. ""You're so good at that. But I want to be inside you. I want to feel you come around my cock.""

He pulled out of my mouth, his cock glistening with my saliva. He turned me around, pressing me against the wall. I felt him enter me, his cock filling me completely.

""Oh god,"" I moaned. ""You're so big.""

""You can take it,"" he said, his voice low and commanding. ""You can take every inch of my cock.""

He began to move, his hips thrusting against mine. I moaned, my body responding to his touch. He reached around, his fingers finding my clit.

""Come for me,"" he said, his voice low and commanding. ""Come all over my cock.""

I moaned, my body tensing as the orgasm washed over me. It was intense, almost overwhelming, and I cried out as the waves of pleasure crashed through me.

He groaned, his body tensing as he came, his cock pulsing inside me. ""Fuck,"" he said, his voice hoarse. ""That was incredible.""

As we floated there, our bodies entwined, I knew that this was just the beginning. I had no idea what the future held, but I knew that I wanted to explore it with him.",1,1730533124.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

People would go on about blue skies and green fields, but for me, those words were simply labels. I‚Äôd nod along, indifferent, feeling like an outsider, watching everyone else share in something I couldn‚Äôt quite reach. Favorite colors, favorite foods, favorite‚Ä¶ anything, honestly‚Äîthese weren‚Äôt things I‚Äôd ever cared about.

But then she blurted out, ‚ÄúYellow! Yellow is your favorite color.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at her certainty, as if she knew me better than I knew myself. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you guess that?‚Äù I asked, amused. This whole idea of favorites felt almost silly, but she said it so confidently, as if it had been an undeniable truth all along.

‚ÄúBecause you just look like a yellow,‚Äù she replied with a playful grin, her eyes dancing with a light that seemed to radiate something I could never quite comprehend.

I laughed, shrugging inwardly. Yellow. Sure, why not? If she thought I was a yellow, then I‚Äôd be a yellow. She had a way of making things seem brighter, pulling me into a world I didn‚Äôt understand but wanted to. Her laughter felt like summer afternoons, and the way her hair curled in front of her eye drove me mad in the best way possible. The freckles on her cheeks seemed handpicked by the universe itself. She was light where I was a shadow, a breath of air in the suffocating haze of my indifference.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your favorite food?‚Äù she asked, leaning in with a teasing look.

I paused. Favorite food? I‚Äôd never given it much thought. Eating was just a routine, something to get through. But her voice made me want to pretend otherwise. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù I asked her, curious to hear what she would make up.

She tilted her head, considering, then smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre definitely a steak guy,‚Äù she declared, her voice warm with certainty. ‚ÄúYou love steak, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I agreed, nodding, ‚Äústeak‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù Her laugh filled the air between us, and even though steak had never really meant much to me, it felt right. Everything she said became truth, and that was enough.

Then I snapped awake, my head throbbing, the pain tearing through my skull like a shotgun blast. The dream had been so vivid, so perfect, but it was always the same: memories of her, memories that felt more like ghosts haunting me, clinging to a past I could never get back. She was gone, and I‚Äôd destroyed everything we‚Äôd had, leaving me with an emptiness that refused to let me go.

I sat up slowly, my body aching as I sank into the worn, sagging cushions of the stained and broken couch. The living room was a prison, and I was its sole inmate. Beer cans littered every surface, some half-empty and leaking stale alcohol onto the floor. The coffee table was covered in thick layers of dust mixed with spilled liquor, creating a grimy film that made the whole room smell sour and rotting. A pill bottle lay discarded near the edge, and I grabbed it, my hands trembling as I shook it. Empty. Always empty. I hurled it toward the kitchen, where dirty plates were piled high, broken ceramic shattered across the floor, catching shards of moonlight like shattered stars.

The house creaked around me, every groan of the old wood echoing the pain in my chest. The wallpaper hung in curling, tattered strips, stained with years of neglect. The air was stale, filled with the scent of decay and the ghost of her perfume. The light from the living room window was cold and pale, bathing everything in a silver sheen that felt almost mocking.

‚ÄúYou have to stop. You‚Äôll kill yourself.‚Äù Her voice came from somewhere behind me, clear and haunting, like she was right there. I twisted around, heart pounding, but there was nothing. Just the empty, lifeless hallway. The walls were covered with broken picture frames, the glass shattered and scattered across the floor. In some of the less-destroyed frames, her smile shone back at me, frozen in happier times. My fingerprints, stained with blood from countless outbursts, smeared the glass. I‚Äôd punched these walls, these memories, over and over, as if somehow that would make the regret and self-loathing go away.

I stumbled into the kitchen, kicking cans and broken plates aside, searching for another bottle. The refrigerator door hung open, its light long dead, and the counters were cluttered with the remnants of a life that had once been vibrant. There were reminders of her everywhere. She‚Äôd filled this kitchen with laughter and warmth, always trying new recipes, dancing to old songs while making a mess we‚Äôd clean up together. Now, it was nothing but ruins, a graveyard of what we‚Äôd once shared.

I found another bottle, this one of cheap whiskey, and took a long swig, the burn numbing me for just a moment. My throat tightened as I swallowed, my eyes stinging with unshed tears. ‚ÄúStop hurting yourself, please. For me,‚Äù her voice pleaded, softer this time. I pressed my palms against my temples, trying to drown her out, but she wouldn‚Äôt leave. The guilt was relentless, her words slicing through me like knives.

I staggered into the bathroom, barely able to keep my balance. The medicine cabinet door hung crooked, the mirror cracked. I yanked it open, my hands shaking as I grabbed another bottle of pills. Swallowing one, then two, then three, I looked at my reflection. My face was gaunt, eyes empty, skin pale and waxy. Dried blood crusted around my knuckles, a reminder of how I‚Äôd lashed out, destroying anything that reminded me of her.

I‚Äôd started using pills to sleep, to escape the nightmares, but now they were a crutch to feel nothing at all. The bathroom was filthy, mildew creeping up the corners, water stains darkening the ceiling. She had once kept this space immaculate, her makeup and hair products neatly arranged, her scent lingering in the air like a warm embrace. Now, it was suffocating, a tomb where hope had died.

The house seemed to breathe around me, creaking, whispering. I heard her voice again, faint and full of sorrow. ‚ÄúYou have to let go.‚Äù The bedroom door loomed at the end of the hallway, a place I hadn‚Äôt dared to enter since she left. Her clothes still lay folded on the bed, the room frozen in time. I‚Äôd left it untouched, unable to face the reminders of what I‚Äôd lost. My hand wrapped around the door handle, and I wanted so desperately to go in, to let the grief wash over me.

But before I could, the front door slammed open, the sound so violent it echoed through the entire house. My hands fell away from the door, and I stumbled back into the living room. The glass crunched under my feet, shards tearing through my bare skin, cutting deep, but I barely registered the pain. Blood pooled around my toes, thin rivulets mixing with the dust and dirt, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to care. The physical agony was almost a relief, a fleeting distraction from the relentless ache in my chest.

Out in the woods, something moved. My breath came in shaky puffs, visible in the moonlight. I could almost make out her silhouette slipping through the trees, disappearing into the underbrush. She had always loved the woods, dragging me there for picnics, telling me about the colors of the leaves, how the sunlight broke through the branches in golden beams. It was her sanctuary, a place she could escape to when the world was too much.

Her laughter drifted from the woods, soft and full of life, and it shattered me. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt follow, knew it was impossible for her to be out there. But her voice kept calling, leading me deeper into the night, and all I could do was chase it, hoping to find her again‚Äîor maybe just a memory of who I used to be.

Colors were just‚Ä¶ there. People would go on about blue skies and green fields, but for me, those words were simply labels. I‚Äôd nod along, indifferent, feeling like an outsider, watching everyone else share in something I couldn‚Äôt quite reach. Favorite colors, favorite foods, favorite‚Ä¶ anything, honestly‚Äîthese weren‚Äôt things I‚Äôd ever cared about.

But then she blurted out, ‚ÄúYellow! Yellow is your favorite color.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at her certainty, as if she knew me better than I knew myself. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you guess that?‚Äù I asked, amused. This whole idea of favorites felt almost silly, but she said it so confidently, as if it had been an undeniable truth all along.

‚ÄúBecause you just look like a yellow,‚Äù she replied with a playful grin, her eyes dancing with a light that seemed to radiate something I could never quite comprehend.

I laughed, shrugging inwardly. Yellow. Sure, why not? If she thought I was a yellow, then I‚Äôd be a yellow. She had a way of making things seem brighter, pulling me into a world I didn‚Äôt understand but wanted to. Her laughter felt like summer afternoons, and the way her hair curled in front of her eye drove me mad in the best way possible. The freckles on her cheeks seemed handpicked by the universe itself. She was light where I was a shadow, a breath of air in the suffocating haze of my indifference.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your favorite food?‚Äù she asked, leaning in with a teasing look.

I paused. Favorite food? I‚Äôd never given it much thought. Eating was just a routine, something to get through. But her voice made me want to pretend otherwise. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù I asked her, curious to hear what she would make up.

She tilted her head, considering, then smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre definitely a steak guy,‚Äù she declared, her voice warm with certainty. ‚ÄúYou love steak, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I agreed, nodding, ‚Äústeak‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù Her laugh filled the air between us, and even though steak had never really meant much to me, it felt right. Everything she said became truth, and that was enough.

Then I snapped awake, my head throbbing, the pain tearing through my skull like a shotgun blast. The dream had been so vivid, so perfect, but it was always the same: memories of her, memories that felt more like ghosts haunting me, clinging to a past I could never get back. She was gone, and I‚Äôd destroyed everything we‚Äôd had, leaving me with an emptiness that refused to let me go.

I sat up slowly, my body aching as I sank into the worn, sagging cushions of the stained and broken couch. The living room was a prison, and I was its sole inmate. Beer cans littered every surface, some half-empty and leaking stale alcohol onto the floor. The coffee table was covered in thick layers of dust mixed with spilled liquor, creating a grimy film that made the whole room smell sour and rotting. A pill bottle lay discarded near the edge, and I grabbed it, my hands trembling as I shook it. Empty. Always empty.

Hi, hello. 

I posted this story in another sub but but it got deleted so I'm going to do it here. I feel like this is actually appropriate (hopefully).

First off, hello Potato Queen!!! Started watching your videos this year and I am obsessed!

Ok now to the story. My Aunt (f54), from my dad's family, passed away recently on 17 Oct 2024. I was quite devastated because she is one of the few people I confide with. Both she and I aren't religious, which make us sort of outcasts from our family (my dad's family mostly). For the story's sake I'll call her Aunt Sally.

During the funeral, another aunty of mine, if whom I will call Aunt Karen, made snide comments about my aunt. Mostly about her choices in life. Aunt Sally married young, and for love, and has no children. She is not financially wealthy or well off but gets by. She has three cats that she adores as well and had a pet canary (r.i.p Kak Mimah).

Aunt Karen, however, got married late, has three kids (who luckily dont share their mother's ideology) and is married to a rather wealthy husband. She's also ultra religious and has a holier-than-thou personality.

I kept quiet for peace.

We recently had a little memorial for Aunt Sally. There, I literally heard the woman mutter under her breath that Aunt Sally wouldn't make to heaven because of her lifestyle and choosing to not believe in the Almighty.

This royally pissed me off.

I decided to enact my vegence. 

Aunt Karen is also superstitious and afraid of stuff like black magic.

I bought a cheap looking doll, banged it up, mangled it's hair, and knocked a nail into its head. I tied coconut rope around it, twisted its legs and wrapped it in white cloth. 

I dipped paper into coffee and wrote gibberish, mostly random symbols, in a spiral pattern to make it look like a talisman. 

I put the doll in a box. I put dried herbs in it and tied it between its hands, a detail I forgot to mention in my post that got deleted. 

I got two packets of salt and dropped it around the doll. Finally I wrote a small letter with my left hand. ""Package has been delivered, please take care"". I think that's what I wrote because I can't recall it now

I had my friend drive me to her house at the dead of night and I dropped it in her backyard.

I hope that she never leaves her house again.



That's my post. I love you Potato Queen!!! Hopefully this is good enough for your subreddit.

Well I just found out why. 

I'm not gonna bore you with the details, but there was a compatibility issue where my machine SAID it was working, but it wasn't because it was calibrated for Windows and I basically told my code editor ""Ignore this warning, trust me it works"", but when I tried to actually launch my code, uh-oh, it didn't work. I actually just spent the last four days trying to find a bug or some misspelling somewhere that was killing my code, until just now that I decided to say ""fck it"", spent an hour setting up a Windows virtual machine (which I have never even done before), and it worked..... it freaking worked with absolutely no problem.....

This.... was type three fun! 

I hated actually starting the project because I barely knew what I was doing, but then I loved coding everything when I actually knew what I was doing, but then I hated wasting four days of my life trying to debug it, all stressed out, amped on coffee, drunk on alcohol to avoid overthinking, and getting only like four hours of sleep, but holy shit did it feel good when I finally figured it out.

It feels good, man....",1,1730531617.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Being Frenshe really reminds me of when SDJ still felt semi niche and the scents are so unique IMO. If anything they‚Äôre a touch more mature than SDJ because they experiment more with their scents. Vanilla Cashmere has toasted jasmine rice as a note and it sets it apart from most vanilla scents on the market imo.

Solar Fleur is also an incredibly juicy and bright scent, I used it in the body oil form which mind you is a brilliant formula. Also for my non fruity, floral or gourmand girlies, they really really really kill it with their citrus scent.

Also Lavender Cloud is such a clean yet creamy lavender, idk how to explain it but it literally smells like light purple to me. 


Idk this seems like pointless rant, but i have a sweet spot for brands that don‚Äôt over do their product line up, as well as invest quality into what products they do make. 

This whole post was prompted by me buying Moon Milk. No joke this is must be my coffee shop order because I LITERALLY smell a chai latte and a cinnamon bun. Layered with the vanilla cashmere adds a very lactonic base.

I need some help upgrading from a Breville Oracle to a new Machine + Grinder  
I've fixed the Oracle a few times but grinder is now looking sad... so seems like a good excuse to upgrade.

Wife is worried a ""real"" grinder and machine will be too hard and slow to use, So I need a few things:  
Hopper on the grinder  
Timed\\Weight dosing  
Tamper that is fool proof  
Great at Milk drinks - 90% Flat Whites  
She'll just have to deal with steam being manual? - but any ideas would be great  
Looks nice - needs to match, both need to be black or white.

Currently thinking:  
\- Eureka Mignon XL 65E Coffee Grinder - for Timed Dosing+Hopper  
\- Some form of spring load tamper

I'm from Italy and approaching the hobby (my grand parents used to have a professional machine in the shop).

I've very limited countertop space and will buy a grinder later (but my roaster is 200m from home...).
We are 2, and will mostly do espressos or cappuccino, for ""longer brews"" we have a variety of filters systems.

I'm particularly in doubt about heating time (they are almost never stated, and the shortest the better for me) and pressure (many state 15 bar pumps, but then only 9bar infusion, or up to 20 bars).
Something which is also never mentioned is loudness, I want to wake my wife with the coffee smell, not the vibrations...

I can get a Gaggia (espresso Evolution maybe) quite cheaply, or was looking for a ""the bambino plus"", or maybe a lelit Anna or Victoria.

Just reading specifics the Gaggia Is 1/3 of the price with similar specifics, while the bambino state a record short heating time (which is important to me).

But I'm open to any suggestions.

We (like to think we) know good coffee. We've both worked in multiple coffee shops and have drank from dozens around the city. Buying out and spending \~$15 per trip adds up quick in a month, and we think it might be a good idea to invest in a home set up.

After some dozen hours of review videos and talking to multiple people at shops in the area, we're seriously considering a Rocket R58.

The build quality and lifespan is a big deal for us. We were told that ""most prosumer¬†machines last about 15 years, give or take, depending on how you treat them."" Also talked to a guy running a coffee cart with a La Marzocco mini and he said, ""This was my home machine and it was *way* too much machine for me, so I use it for my cart now.""

We ended up on the R58 after a long chat with someone from Visions Espresso in downtown Seattle, One of the biggest selling points was when he said, ""15 years? No. If you take care of it, it'll out last both of us.""

Is there any glaring reason we should¬†*not*¬†get this machine?  
Pros (for us):  
PID (we want to be able to control the temp)  
Tank build (was told this machine would outlast me and be something I could give to my children, if taken care of)   
Dual boiler  
Option to be plumbed in

Cons:  
$3,500 + a good grinder is a pretty good chunk of change.

Is there any glaring reason to¬†*not*¬†get the R58? Is there another machine near the same price (or less) that does everything as well, or better?

Location: Seattle, WA  
Preferred drinks: Milk, some straight espresso (Americanos too), and 95% decaf these days  
Drink frequency: Daily. Multiple. No less than 2 a day for each wife and I.  
Space: We have quite a bit of room (we know an R58 will fit)  
Experience level: Have worked in multiple coffee shops, not masters, but not clueless  
Manual or electric: The more ""old school"" the better (within reason, I don't want to ride a bike to pump the water or something). But the Decent or Micra with all the app stuff is *NOT* what we want.

maybe it's the drugs, you wonder, but then again you only really use the socially acceptable ones, caffeine when the sun rises and various depressants in the evenings when you get home and try to forget about reality for a while. it makes you think you're a normal person, this routine, the morning coffee allows you to adopt the appearance of a human being, at least until lunch, then another dose is needed to maintain the illusion, both for yourself and for the skinwalkers and ghouls you're forced to interact with in the office, usually a shot of espresso and that tides you over until about 2:30 or 3, but who really gets anything done after 3 anyway?

off work and it's time to relax, a glass of aperitif before dinner, maybe a hit of a joint and a melatonin pill to fall asleep, nothing crazy, and anyway, you haven't got anything to do. it's your time off and you have the right to spend it however you see fit, haven't you?

so on the first frostbitten morning of the year you're unwillingly dragged out of the artifice of summertime. you recall that not very long ago you'd had a kind of optimism, a real, tangible hope for the future, an openness to possibility! the world had seemed so full of life then, you'd been drunk on pollen and sweet beer, sitting on a backyard patio somewhere, with other people, too. and they'd seemed friendly, you'd all been laughing and appreciating being with others, vague remembrances of fragments of conversation around a fire pit. all had seemed right. but that uneasiness always stayed with you, even then, you'd just had the strength to fight it off, at least for a moment. what was it? that ineffable feeling of emptiness, you knew somehow that it would return, that none of this could last.

you'd shared a kiss with a beautiful girl, a summer girl, in her summer dress. you did things like eat italian food and share a bottle of sparkling wine. you ate sushi and saw some bad movie, you didn't care, she fell asleep on your shoulder, she fell asleep against your chest and it was just sublime, you felt complete. you know it's pathetic but they were the best moments of your life. but then the cracks emerged, she saw something in you that she didn't like, you didn't handle it well, you weren't good enough. not good enough for her, not good enough for anyone, the same feeling as all the times before. you don't measure up, especially not in your own mind.

so it ended, and summertime went away too. you let yourself indulge in the autumn of self-pity for a while, but eventually you exhausted the meaning in that, you can't even keep the pain of loss, it means nothing to you now, you barely remember why you were ever happy in the first place. in its place now is a vague hopelessness, weak and mawkish. you step on some fallen leaves, walk into a bar, sit in silence. you feel a solemn appreciation for the cold, a glimpse into the kind face of death.",1,1730530437.0,redscarepod,7,0.67,False

What's more is when I first came here I was rich in spirit; which is something poor people say to feel better about themselves. LOL! Seriously, though I was just starting my business and I was only able to take home about $400 a month.

When I first came here most of the women I met wanted money or to be able to brag to their friends that they screwed a black guy. I didn't really mind either since I didn't have any money to give and what man doesn't like having a lot of girls wanting to get in his pants? But then it got boring and I started to feel used, they'd take me to bed but never home to Mom. One girl I was really into told me ""oh you have a big \*\*\* but an ugly face, it'd be embarrassing to show you to my friends"". 

So then I tried to date girls seriously and it was a little tougher. Once they realized I was telling the truth when I said I didn't have any money suddenly they became busy. Then I realized it was time to change strategies. I stopped searching in Makati.  I found the girls there to be pretentious. They expected to be treated to expensive restaurants and trips to Boracay because the last foreign guy that they screwed did that for them.

That's why my first date was always coffee or something like that. I took my now fiance to Landers (equivalent to Costco) on our first date. We had a slice of pizza and a soda.  I never pretended to be something I wasn't. She said she liked my values and how I'd turn down potential customers and their money if I didn't genuinely feel like I could help them.  As things started to get better and better I did take her to nicer places but what I really liked is how she never *asked* nor expected it.

I would call on those who complain about Filipinas being gold diggers to take a little personal responsibility. It never ceases to amuse me how some guys will choose high-maintenance chicks with a Californian attitude and then complain when she expects to be treated to the best restaurants and any gift that costs less than $100 is an insult.

When I was vetting a girl one of the first things I'd ask her is 'What does a good first date look like to you?'. If she rambled off expensive restaurants or doing expensive things then I knew she wasn't right for me.  That being said Filipinas tend to not be direct so they may say something like 'Oh I just want someone who loves me and accepts me for who I am'. That's also a lie and a red flag.  What I liked about my fiance is she said 'Well nowhere expensive but a comfortable place where I can look into his eyes and get to know him better'. I liked her so much after that because it was a genuine honest answer.  She's a public school teacher who would stand in front of a bus for her students. She's also a Girl Scout troop leader. I really don't know what I did to deserve her. So for my fellow passport bros in the Philippines don't give up.

I found out about my ex's PA during my pregnancy and my son is now 4 months old. after 4 d-days, culminating in worsening behaviour being trickle truthed - meeting up with SWs, messaging random girls on SC, catcalling women in the street - I ended up leaving in July after he physically assaulted me. My bad for wanting to talk about the sex worker he had entertained in my car. After I left, more trickle truth - he had pleasured himself to my friends and family, sometimes while they were in the house with me, INCLUDING my 17 year old niece, and he had sexually assaulted me in my sleep - until I then found out he had a record for grabbing a woman's body part in the street. 

I got social services involved. He was domestically violent and he was a danger to women, and me. Social services largely to just left me to it, because I had involvement from domestic violence services and the police also. I told him he had to get better if he wanted to be in mine and my son's life. He said he wanted me back so bad, he'd do anything. 

He went through STOPSO in the UK, and got a therapist. He tried for a while to get better. It took two months of his pathetic ""trying"", until he decided to drop his sessions down to once a fortnight because he was better now. He said, 4 days after I found he had taken pictures of my body without my consent during a supervised visit with his son,  ""I don't need therapy as much, I'm better now."" ""What coping mechanisms do you actually have?"" I asked him. ""I just don't watch porn,"" he replied. I knew then it was the end. I stuck around for as long as I could justify, just to see and to be able to tell my son that I tried to have his father in his life. But his true ways won, after all. He's not sick, he's not broken, he's doesn't need to be fixed. He's a narcissist and he won't change.

But now, me and my son are thriving. Do you know how easy an infant feels compared to looking after his ego? I've got my cat, I've got a little house to myself a 5 minute drive from my cousin, who is very glad she can tell me all about how much she hated him on a daily catch ups. I don't have parents or much other family - how do you think I got damaged enough to pick my ex? - but I've got a solid support network. I'm never lonely, I've gotten back into writing in a big way and I'm looking to finish that novel. So there is hope, for victims of porn addiction! Just not for him. I was sitting here with a coffee, watching my son grab his feet, listening to Taylor Swift, in peace, finally. Life is sweet, and it's all you guys. If I hadn't posted here, and you didn't point out that I needed to leave, I wouldn't have. So, thank you. So much ",3,1730529250.0,loveafterporn,2,1.0,False

Just wanted to take a moment to appreciate how underrated our city is. Sure, we might be known as that 'most isolated city' in the world, but honestly, who needs the chaos when you have this much sunshine? 

Beaches that are basically Instagram filters in real life: Cottesloe, Scarborough, City Beach‚Äîtake your pick. It's like the ocean wakes up every day and says, 'Time to make every other coastline jealous.'


The traffic is... not that bad: Okay, maybe we all have a collective sigh when Mitchell Freeway becomes a car park at 5 p.m., but admit it, it‚Äôs not Sydney bad. Plus, if you‚Äôre lucky, you might witness a unicorn moment of a courteous driver letting you merge.


 King's Park‚Äînature's flex spot: It's the kind of park where you can go for a walk, have a picnic, contemplate life, or just play 'spot the couple taking engagement photos.' Also, where else can you sit under a giant boab tree and feel existentially small in the best way?


The nightlife isn‚Äôt just kangaroos and crickets: Between rooftop bars with killer views and live music venues in Northbridge that will surprise you, there‚Äôs definitely more than enough to keep the FOMO at bay. And if you're lucky, you'll spot that guy in the banana suit. You know the one.

 The coffee is legit: Melbourne who? Perth‚Äôs baristas are putting out espresso so good that even the seagulls at Freo Markets would fight you for.


Perth quirks: Where else do you see a city that talks about the 'big blue boathouse' like it‚Äôs a national landmark? Or where an emu in your backyard is just a regular Tuesday in the 'burbs?

So, what‚Äôs your favorite thing about Perth? Share the love or let‚Äôs just agree it‚Äôs the best place to live while secretly hoping more people don‚Äôt find out."" Actually, it seems it's just been discovered by the rest of the world with the amount of people wanting to live here.

1ghqe1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ghqe1k/back_again_with_more_sleep_disturbance/,Back again with more sleep disturbance,"Had another episode of waking up in a panic due to a strange feeling again. 

This time was less clear cut and tbh I barely remember a lot of it. I just know that I felt weird(?) sleeping, flew up and my body felt super stiff from waking- mainly my left arm. This much has happened before. I think the medical episode I fear of occurring during sleep feels similar to stroke and it flies me awake (left arm numbing). I remember earlier in the night something similar happened but less intense: I wasn‚Äôt asleep yet and felt a strange head sensation as normal for these kinds of episodes, then I instinctively moved my body around to distract from this strange feeling that I felt was bound to be a medical episode. Bc I was actually awake for this, I told myself I‚Äôll just control my reactions to this feeling and that‚Äôll help. But bc I fell in deep asleep, I wasn‚Äôt able to control my reactions this time around.

In the past when this has occurred, I‚Äôd be able to control the intensity of these reactions by simply allowing the strange sensations to just occur and not flying up or moving to ‚Äúrun‚Äù from them. With this; I‚Äôd be able to figure this is all a long-winded panic attack but I‚Äôm still paranoid these episodes mean something more. Last week I made note of how these seem to occur on days of my acid reflux being triggered (like tonight). I woke up from this episode maybe 15 min ago now and I feel some heartburn now. I had decaf coffee and crepe cake pretty late before bed, maybe by an hour.

The left arm stiffness concerns me though. I‚Äôve seen some posts on here about it but it‚Äôs still freaky. I‚Äôm gonna have to be strict about no meals at least 3-4 hours till bedtime bc this is crazy

When I was 15 or 16 I was intrigued by all things paranormal. I ended up making an ouija board and even using my own blood on it (stupid, I know but I did research and supposedly this would help me actually make contact).

  I asked so many questions that night but I only ever got one response. I asked if anyone could see me. The planchette darted to ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and then I got no further answers.

  I thought nothing of it because I had got barely any activity, but soon after weird things started to happen. I would feel like I was being watched constantly, and had this weird sense of dread I couldn‚Äôt shake.

   One night I was on Snapchat texting friends and I was in the dark. I had a fan a few feet away from the foot of my bed that had a small red light that stayed on when the fan was on. I began to feel like I wasn‚Äôt alone in my room and since it was so dark I was scared to get up and turn on the light. I noticed the fan light was ‚Äúblinking‚Äù and I remember freezing up. Then I realized it wasn‚Äôt blinking at all, something was walking in front of it and that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt see the light. I decided to snap a quick picture with the flash on to see what was going on. At first I didn‚Äôt notice anything in the photo but upon further inspection I saw the top corner of the most disturbing face I‚Äôve ever seen. White flaky skin and black empty eye sockets. Jet black greasy hair that appeared to be parted down the middle.

  I called for my dad and when he came running in I made up an excuse that I had a bad dream. My dad is very religious and I was afraid to tell him what I had done. So I decided to deal with it alone.

  After that I began to experience sleep paralysis. At first I would hear this raspy voice saying my name over and over. This went on for days. Then one day in my sleep paralysis I saw the same thing from the picture standing all the way at the end of my room in the doorway (it was day time) I had begun to sleep a lot during the day because I was terrified at night. In the light of day this thing was still just as terrifying. It seemed like every day that I had these paralysis episodes, this thing would get closer and closer.

  It began to affect my friends around me too. One night we were hotboxing in a dark closet and my friend asked why I was scratching her. I told her it wasn‚Äôt me and we began to try and open the door. It seemed to be locked even though there was no lock. We both began screaming and pounding on the door and eventually her roommate came and opened it and we piled out, both of us covered in what felt like scratches but appeared to be burns. (If you‚Äôve ever done the eraser challenge, the burns/scratches looked like that)

  Things kept escalating and that same friend who was in the closet with me went and bought a protection amulet and gave it to me. It was a necklace. The next day I had the worst sleep paralysis ever. I didn‚Äôt see the thing anywhere and I thought I could just even out my breathing and I would wake up. But when I opened my eyes, it was hanging upside down off the wall above me like some creepy spider. It screeched the loudest scream I‚Äôve ever heard and I felt its hair touching my face. I passed out from the terror.

  After that I refused to sleep. I drank coffee and redbull and forced myself to stay awake. On my second night of no sleep my and my friends were outside in their backyard drinking. I was tired so I zoned out and was looking at the roofs of the houses I could see from there. I saw the figure standing on a roof in the distance. I felt the panic set in and I turned to the friend sitting next to me to see if she was looking at it too.

  That friend had blue eyes and when I looked at her they were so dark. She looked dead into my face and with no expression said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming for you‚Äù. I jumped up from my seat and began screaming at her and crying. She snapped out of it and was so confused. My older friends took me into their room and tried to calm me down.

  That‚Äôs when I knew I needed to take action. My friends knew this lady who was gifted spiritually and they took me to her and begged her to help me. She set about two dozen stones down and told me to choose one. I asked her what she meant, and she said I would know which one to choose, but just to feel them and choose ‚Äúthe one‚Äù.

  There were so many different ones. Purple, sky blue, ash grey, all random stones I wasn‚Äôt familiar with. This deep black and red one caught my attention. It felt so heavy in my hand and I got a weird feeling when I held it. When I chose it she told me we needed to act fast.

  I don‚Äôt remember the setup of her ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù but I know it involved candles, the stone, a wooden box and locking me and her in the room. I was uncomfortable because I didn‚Äôt know her but I knew I needed to do something. I was pretty calm besides the anxiety I had from being locked in a room with a stranger. 

  She sat across from me and held my hands. She told me no matter what to not leave the room until she said so. She said I would want to but to not do it under any circumstances. Her husband has been instructed to stand outside just in case. 

  She began chanting over and over the same phrase, ‚ÄúWhatever entity has attached itself to this child, leave. You are unwelcome. I command you to leave‚Äù. 

  I don‚Äôt know why but the more she chanted, the angrier I got. I told her to stop, she didn‚Äôt. I yelled at her to stop, she didn‚Äôt. I let go of her hands, she remained chanting with her eyes closed. I felt this horrible flame of anger rising up. I banged on the door like a psych patient, screamed and cussed her out. This went on for about five minutes maybe and finally she opened her eyes, and was looking at something behind me, above me. I passed out. I felt all the energy drain from me and I was only out for about a minute or two.

  When I woke up her husband was in the room and she handed him the wooden box with the stone I chose inside and told him to go bury it deep in the desert. 

  I felt different, lighter. I cried and thanked her over and over again. She hugged me and told me that she stopped it from being able to feed on my but that it would still try to search me out eventually. And that the only way I could close that door forever was to do it the same way I opened it. But she warned me I couldn‚Äôt play the board again until I was mentally and spiritually strong. 

  But I was safe. And so grateful. It‚Äôs been years now and I‚Äôm 23. I‚Äôve had a few dreams where I hear that voice calling my name. I‚Äôve had sleep paralysis here and there but I‚Äôve only heard its voice once or twice. In 2020 my friend who was there during all of it was now living in another state and we only saw each other maybe twice a year called me hysterical that she had a dream that I was tied up in some dark room and that some creepy thing was circling me and laughing. I asked her to describe it and she described what I had been seeing to a T.

  I went through some things recently that made me a lot stronger, and I am not afraid anymore. I know that it is a low vibrational entity that was preying on me. But I also don‚Äôt know if and even how to sever this attachment forever. 

  Does anyone have any advice on how to do so maybe that doesn‚Äôt involve the ouija board?

Hello y'all! 

finally have time off from work, thus here I am looking to meet new people! I'm from Texas but am ethnically Indian! 

I absolutely love to cook and find food from different cultures! Loves to try new coffee places! Currently works in the hospitality sector, catching stray angry people everyday lmao! 

Most of my day apart from work goes into working out, gardening and playing video games! Currently playing Spiderman and val! I absolutely love cats and have memes saved for every situation hahaha! My music taste is so random, it varies from Korean music to jazz at night! 

Guilty pleasures include eating a tub of hazelnut ice cream and watching kdramas on cheat days! I am patient and a very good listener, so if ya wanna rant, ears are always open! 

All I ask for you to be is kind and communicative! If you feel like we can vibe, hmu!  

Also, happy diwali! ",1,1730528095.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
