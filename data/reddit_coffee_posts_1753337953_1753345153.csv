1m7yi5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1m7yi5c/fed_up_with_my_husbands_lack_of_help_and/,Fed up with my husband’s lack of help and appreciation,"This is a rant but I need to get it off my chest.

My husband cooks all the evening meals and I do all of the household work, cleaning, hoovering, laundry, taking the bins, grocery shopping etc. I make his lunches every morning too. By and large, I’m not that dissatisfied but for sure I’m doing more timewise in the house. 

My main gripe is he’s really starting to take the piss with it, like can’t be bothered to even put a cup in the dishwasher and will just put it on the counter above. There’s a fabric drying mat for washing up on the counter and I’ve asked him 1000x not to leave oily tins and cans on there because it soaks into the material, and preferably rinse them out instead of leaving them to me. I also do all of the morning and day dog walking and he takes the dog out last thing at night for a pee and the odd walk here and there. This includes weekends so he can sleep in.

My tipping point was reached today. I’m in the middle of a brutal IVF round, where I am swollen to the max and starting to struggle getting about. Due to the hormones, I got a very severe migraine yesterday and was in bed from 5pm onwards. He cooked his own dinner and left all the cans, chopping boards and bowls out just on the side. The counters were filthy. So I still have to get up at 6.30am today to walk the dog and do my injections whilst he sleeps in. In the morning, I’m usually tidying up whilst he leisurely drinks his coffee and goes to work. I asked him this morning to please at least put his coffee cup in the dishwasher which was met with an angry ‘you’re not Cinderella so stop behaving like it. You leave your mug in the bathroom too’. I admit this did used to happen- I work early so I can be home in good time for the dog but since he complained about it I have stopped- he also didn’t tidy it up himself either. I can’t believe such a small ask can be met with such a visceral reaction. He stomped around for the rest of the morning and did at least put away his weeks worth of clothes thrown in a basket which I had stopped putting away for him. He didn’t even ask how I was feeling.

I’m so fed up now with how ungrateful he is and he seems to justify himself not doing anything by convincing himself I don’t do anything or what I do isn’t good enough. People comment how tidy our house always is so I know I’m not doing a bad job. When mentioned before he says he cooks and does DIY which I can’t do. It’s true he does it, but he does it when he wants- we had our shower with a taped up trash bag on it to keep the water out for 2 years until he got round to putting the plate back on. 

tl;dr husband gets angry when asked to do the most basic of chores and I’m tired

Anw, yung reason of breakup namin before is very okay, kaya kahit break kami that time friends padin kami. Hehehe.  
  
Way back before pa sobrang generous na siya: laging may regalo, dinadayo pa ako para lang magkita! Nahihiya ako noon kasi hindi naman gaano ka well-off family ko at hindi sanay sa ganitong klaseng treats.   
  
Seryoso, next-level generosity ng girlfriend ko! Ralph Lauren windbreaker? Check. PDI sunscreen? Check. Duffel bag for sleepovers? Check. DeFacto sweatshirts? Check. At hindi nauubusan ng GCash, coffee, at pastries. Sobrang nahihiya nanaman ako. T\_\_\_\_\_T  
  
Pero ngayon, may trabaho na ako kaya makaka-buy na rin ako ng pampa-surprise sa kanya. Pero ayun, grabe—mas lalo pa siyang naging generous!",7,1753343544.0,MayNagChat,10,1.0,False
1m7yabl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1m7yabl/qcrit_four_letter_words_adult_contemporary/,"[QCrit] Four Letter Words, Adult Contemporary Romance, 99k words, 1st attempt, Query + 300 words","Long time lurker, first time poster, hence the new account (I didn't want it jumbled up with all my personal stuff). I've been actively querying since March and only recently found out my query letter was probably too long! I had feedback from people in the industry and I thought it was alright until I read a post on here saying it shouldn't be more than 350 words? At the time my letter clocked in at about 800! So I've cut it down to about 600 but I'd love feedback on making it more concise/sharp without sounding gimmicky. 

I'd also welcome constructive feedback on my first 300. My first draft got feedback that it suffered from white-room syndrome so when I started again I tried to include more description. 

  
**Query:**

Dear *AGENT*,

FOUR LETTER WORDS, is a dual-POV, enemies-to-lovers adult contemporary romance set in modern-day London. Perfect for fans of the workplace shenanigans in The Hating Game; the witty banter in Get a Life, Chloe Brown; and the sizzling slow-burn tension between Osha Aniseya and Qimir of The Acolyte. Complete at 99,000 words.

*\[Agent personalisation\]*

They say there’s a thin line between love and hate, and they’re both four letter words . . . 

Financial analyst Olivia Baker is *not* a workaholic. She’ll admit she puts her nose to the grindstone more than most, but going above and beyond is the best way to climb the career ladder while saving up to fund her ultimate dream: a community centre for underprivileged youth she’d sketched out with her father before he unexpectedly passed away. When Olivia learns her boss is being promoted, Olivia puts herself forward to replace her, a position that would make her the first Black head of their department and put her on the fast track to funding her dream. Her boss says Olivia will be a shoo-in for the promotion—*if* she picks up more responsibility and plans the annual office Christmas party with her nemesis, silver spoon nepo-baby Chris Westbury. 

Reformed playboy and analyst Chris Westbury is newly sober and desperate to redeem himself in the eyes of his upper-class family. Chris puts his hat in the ring for the same promotion Olivia’s gunning for, promising their boss he and Olivia can mesh, not clash. The more time they spend alone together, however, the more Chris’s fascination with making Olivia explode in frustration turns into an altogether *different* fascination. 

The pair find themselves trading witty barbs both in and out of the bedroom—and fighting their growing mutual affection tooth and nail.

Olivia knows she can’t afford to lose focus. Her dream depends on this promotion, and the last thing she needs is smooth-talking Chris stealing it from under her. Chris is determined to show his family his troubled past is firmly behind him, and securing this promotion will help accomplish just that.

For feelings-averse Chris, the answer is simple: A no-strings-attached, frenemies-with-benefits arrangement to relieve stress and keep their distracting thoughts to a minimum.

But starting an office fling while vying for the same promotion can’t possibly end well… Can it?

I’m a Black *(LGBTQ)* woman who discovered romance novels in my early teens, hiding battered copies of Mills and Boon novels under my pillow. I want to write stories featuring women who don’t always fit conventional beauty standards: the plus-size women of colour who I see and interact with every day but who don’t get enough love in the romance space.

I’d love to build a long-term collaborative relationship with an agent who sees my potential, values my voice, and wants to champion my stories.

I'm pleased to include (*materials*).

  
**First 300:**

If one more cocksucking thing went wrong, Olivia Baker was going to fling herself into the path of the next oncoming bus.

It was laundry day, so of course everything was dirty except her white blouse and old navy trousers, the latter a size too small and pinching in the thighs. Olivia really needed to pay more attention to those cleaning tips that preached about doing a load of laundry a day. 

She’d gotten a text from her boss, Madison, asking her to come in earlier than usual. Maybe she could have said no, or ignored it, but she needed her job—and actually liked it most of the time—so she’d acquiesced. Running on four hours of sleep and a breakfast of chocolate-covered coffee beans, Olivia had rushed off to work. Of course, the one day she didn’t wear her big waterproof coat, it was pouring down with rain, making everything and everyone on the overground damp and steaming, and adding a new layer to London’s usual grime. Her hair had started to frizz out of her hastily braided bun, and her edges were lifting. That new organic styling mousse her sister had given her could go fuck itself; her hair needed industrial-strength holding gel to keep it in place.

She scurried through the glass and steel lobby of Stratford Gold Mutual and sped past the reception desks, waving absently to the pair of newly hired front desk workers that she really needed to stop and say hello to when she got a spare minute.

In her haste, she’d forgotten to wash out her reusable flask at home and had settled on a takeaway cup from the cart in the pavilion in front of the building. It was this cup—this treacherous, devil-sent cup now filled with piping hot caramel mocha—that chose that moment to tip over as she, clutching bag, cup and umbrella in one hand, pulled out her ID card, scorching coffee spilling onto her blazer and formerly white blouse.

Ever feel like you don’t know enough to start a business? Like you need fancy degrees or years of experience?
Stop right there.
Here’s the truth: Asking simple questions is your #1 secret weapon.

Why asking works magic:

Free knowledge: People LOVE sharing what they know. Just ask!

Find real problems: Ask customers: “What’s the #1 thing annoying you about [X]?” → They’ll tell you exactly what to fix.

Build fans: When you ask, people feel heard. They’ll remember you.

No guesswork: Stop assuming. Ask instead.

It costs $0: Seriously. Just your courage.

How to ask (without feeling awkward):

Start small:
“Hey, I’m just starting out. What do you wish existed for [your hobby/job]?”

Be specific:
“What’s the hardest part about cleaning your golf clubs?”
“Where do you get stuck when baking gluten-free?”

Use places people chat:
Reddit threads, Facebook groups, Instagram polls, even friends at coffee.

Listen. Really listen: Don’t talk. Just write down what they say.

Say thank you: A little gratitude goes far.

Real examples:

A guy asked boat owners: “What’s the worst part about boat maintenance?” They said “cleaning fish gunk out of tiny spaces.” → He made a $5 brush tool. Sold 10,000+.

A home baker asked: “What gluten-free flour do you HATE?” → She made a better blend → Now a full business.

Plant lover asked: “Why do your houseplants die?” → People said “forget to water” → She made cute reminder stickers.

The big takeaway:
You don’t need all the answers.
You just need to ask the right questions.
The more you ask, the smarter you get.
The smarter you get, the better your business.

So… what’s one question you’ve been scared to ask?
Ask it below! 👇 Let’s help each other out.

Ever feel like you don’t know enough to start a business? Like you need fancy degrees or years of experience?
Stop right there.
Here’s the truth: Asking simple questions is your #1 secret weapon.

Why asking works magic:

Free knowledge: People LOVE sharing what they know. Just ask!

Find real problems: Ask customers: “What’s the #1 thing annoying you about [X]?” → They’ll tell you exactly what to fix.

Build fans: When you ask, people feel heard. They’ll remember you.

No guesswork: Stop assuming. Ask instead.

It costs $0: Seriously. Just your courage.

How to ask (without feeling awkward):

Start small:
“Hey, I’m just starting out. What do you wish existed for [your hobby/job]?”

Be specific:
“What’s the hardest part about cleaning your golf clubs?”
“Where do you get stuck when baking gluten-free?”

Use places people chat:
Reddit threads, Facebook groups, Instagram polls, even friends at coffee.

Listen. Really listen: Don’t talk. Just write down what they say.

Say thank you: A little gratitude goes far.

Real examples:

A guy asked boat owners: “What’s the worst part about boat maintenance?” They said “cleaning fish gunk out of tiny spaces.” → He made a $5 brush tool. Sold 10,000+.

A home baker asked: “What gluten-free flour do you HATE?” → She made a better blend → Now a full business.

Plant lover asked: “Why do your houseplants die?” → People said “forget to water” → She made cute reminder stickers.

The big takeaway:
You don’t need all the answers.
You just need to ask the right questions.
The more you ask, the smarter you get.
The smarter you get, the better your business.

1m7y5o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1m7y5o3/my_husband_almost_cheated_twice_i_dont_know_if/,My husband almost cheated twice — I don’t know if it’s trauma or manipulation. I need advice.,"Hi everyone. I’m writing here because I feel completely lost and don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in my late 20s and have been with my husband for 6 years — it’s been a deep and loving relationship that I always thought was healthy and strong.

Last October, he had what he called an “episode” — he went for coffee with another woman and convinced himself he wasn’t supposed to be with me anymore. Nothing physical happened, but emotionally it shook me. Still, we worked hard together to rebuild trust and move forward. Things seemed better after that.

But recently I discovered (on my own — he didn’t tell me) that since May he’s been doing things behind my back again. He’s been talking to online prostitutes, asking them for prices without buying anything. He’s also been selling his own explicit photos to men for money and trying to order erotic massages, though he claims he never followed through.

When I confronted him, he admitted everything. He said it’s connected to childhood trauma — that he was molested as a kid and this behavior is some kind of twisted coping mechanism: to seek something but never actually receive it. He insists that he never physically cheated and now wants to go to therapy and change everything. He says it was another “episode” and not who he really is.

I’m torn. For six years he was the most faithful, respectful, devoted man — never looked at or commented on other women. I thought he was incapable of betrayal. And now this has happened not once, but twice.

I feel betrayed, confused, and emotionally exhausted. I want to go visit my brother in another country for a while just to clear my head and breathe. I love my husband deeply, but I don’t know if this is a mental health crisis I should support him through — or manipulation and emotional abuse in disguise.

If you’ve been through anything similar, or if you have any perspective at all, I’d really appreciate hearing it.

It’s the kind where you can take a book or leave one. I walked by it this morning on the way to get coffee and saw a child standing on tiptoe, trying to reach the top shelf. I offered to help, and he pointed to a worn copy of Charlotte’s Web. ""This one,"" he said. ""My mom used to read it to me."" He clutched it like treasure.

Later that day, I left a note inside that same box: “To whoever finds this, I hope you have a gentle day. You matter more than you know.” The next morning, I passed by again and saw someone had added their own message: “Thank you. I really needed this today.”

Sometimes, the quietest things have the loudest impact. A book shared, a kind word, a smile exchanged with a stranger. Not everything good has to be big. The small stuff counts too. Often, it’s what keeps us going.",11,1753342984.0,u_MochiMae306,0,1.0,False

RULES FOR FLIGHT 303

(Rules etched with a broken stylus on the side of the reinforced cargo pod. Found glowing faintly in infrared spectrum.)


---

1. Between 02:00 and 03:00 AM IST, ignore all human voices coming from outside the aircraft.

Sub-Rule 1A: If the voice sounds like your mother, seal both ears and whisper your own serial number backward.

Sub-Rule 1B: If you don’t remember your number, cut your palm and draw the Greek letter “ψ” (psi) on your chest.

Conditional: If you answer the voice, prepare for extraction via window breach. No recovery will be attempted.



2. Do not monitor Cargo #17 directly through digital feeds.

Sub-Rule 2A: If you see a second face in the thermal cam feed, power down the monitor.

Sub-Rule 2B: If the feed shows your own face looking back at you—but blinking out of sync—cut all electrical power to the bay.

Note: Analog observation is recommended. Use mirror shards if necessary.



3. Entity 17 will attempt mimicry. Never acknowledge it by your real name.

Conditional: If it correctly guesses your name three times in a row, it earns a “bond right.” You will begin to forget who you are.

Sub-Rule 3A: When it asks “Am I doing it right?”, say “Not yet.” Then leave the area immediately. Do NOT look back.



4. Any crew member wearing brown is part of the FAILSAFE protocol. They are not human.

Sub-Rule 4A: Accept coffee if offered. Spit it out into your sleeve, quietly. Do not let it touch your tongue.

Conditional: If you consume the entire cup, you are no longer under human jurisdiction. Refrain from using your voice. It belongs to someone else now.



5. If the cabin pressure spikes and then stabilizes on its own, initiate Prayer Protocol B-5.

Sub-Rule 5A: Recite the phrase: “Through shadow, the sky is held. Through silence, we stay whole.”

Sub-Rule 5B: If the oxygen masks drop with teeth attached, remain still. Let them pass. Do not breathe through your nose.

PERSONAL FIELD LOG — John Farrow, Blackstripe Security Division

Level 3 (Classified Debrief)


---

21:42 IST – Hanger B, Sheremetyevo
I should’ve known something was off. The security handoff was silent—no chatter, no eye contact. Just a clipboard, a gun I was told not to use, and a cargo plane that hummed before it powered on.

The tail number was blacked out. The pilot didn't speak. He just handed me a folder with a red stripe and said:

> “Don't leave your post. Don’t try to understand it.”



Inside was a rules list—no signature, just smudges of blood and that weird Greek letter again: ψ.


---

22:11 IST – Cargo Inspection

Cargo #17. Coded “A.R.I.E.L.” — Autonomous Reality-Interfacing Entity (Leashed).
Looked like a coffin wrapped in electrical coils. Every now and then, the metal pulsed like a heartbeat.

There was a mirror mounted above it, angled down. I wasn’t supposed to look into it. I did.

I saw myself—but blinking late, and smiling before I could.


---

00:47 IST – First Protocol Breach

The brown-uniform man appeared near the aft ramp. He was holding a tray. Coffee and biscuits.
I remembered Rule 4. Took the coffee, nodded, walked away.

He didn’t blink. At all.

Then he whispered, right in my ear, “You’ll remember none of this when the wings fold.”


---

01:28 IST – External Interference Detected

We began receiving a beacon from above us. Not below. Not level. Above.

> “Redcap 303, please respond. You're off-course. Return now.”



The pilot said nothing. Then I heard my voice through the intercom:

> “This is Farrow. I’m outside. Let me in.”



I wasn’t speaking. I was right there. Hands shaking. Gun useless.

I almost opened the hatch. Almost.


---

02:08 IST – Left Window Protocol Triggered

The stars disappeared. Replaced by eyes.

I blinked six times. Started humming the Soviet anthem backward. (I didn’t know I knew it.)
The thing outside frowned. Not angry. Disappointed.

It wrote something into the condensation of the window.

""ψ31 - BOND ESTABLISHED""


---

03:00–03:33 IST – Entity Awakening Window

Cargo #17 started to unfold.

It wasn’t a person. It wasn’t not one either. Limbs too long. Head upside down. Its mouth was a second face.

It said:

> “Farrow. Farrow. Farrow.”
“Am I doing it right?”



I paused. Nearly forgot Rule 3. Nearly said “Yes.”
Instead, I whispered, “Not yet.”
It smiled—my smile.

Then it split apart like a broken TV signal, and vanished into the upper vents.


---

03:55 IST – The Cockpit That Isn’t

We began to descend. No clearance from Delhi ATC.
The intercom spoke:

> “Landing procedures initiated. Thank you for flying Manifest 303.”



I ran to the cockpit. It opened inward.
Beyond it: a sky that bled like meat, and an inverted city above us, hanging like fruit.
The pilot floated upside down, eyes missing, mouth stitched closed. He mouthed the word: “Hatchling.”

I screamed until the door closed.


---

04:33 IST – Emergency Altitude Restoration

The pressure dropped to zero. Blood from my gums floated like thread.

I scrambled to Seat C-14. It didn’t exist. Found it anyway. Behind the cargo wall.

The crank was bone-white, inscribed with black glyphs.
I turned it counterclockwise. The plane screamed—not the engines. The plane.

Then we rose.


---

05:30 IST – Atmospheric Re-entry

We weren’t in Earth's airspace. We passed back through something like film. Everything rippled.

Entity #17 returned. No longer mimicking. It bowed. It placed something in my pocket.

A folded paper.

On it:
""ψ = Access. They watched through you. You're the next crate.""


---

CODES FOUND

1. Etched in cargo crate wall:

> ψ31-ECHO-GLASS
(Meaning: Subject Farrow has been designated a reflection node. “Echo-glass” refers to mirrored interface breaches.)




2. Scrawled in brown-uniform man’s coffee tray:

> mirror.mirror@0404 // access(“notpilot”)
(Decryption attempt reveals: Login ID used by non-biological pilot. The cockpit was being operated remotely.)




3. Under mirror in lavatory:

> INVERT THE SKY TO STALL THE CRASH
(Interpretation: Flip celestial mapping – implies we were inside a false atmospheric layer. Crash only preventable by perception inversion.)




4. Embedded in hum from Cargo #17 (via frequency analysis):

> FARROW = NEW CONTAINER
(Entity selected new host.)






---

FINAL STATUS: SUBJECT JOHN FARROW

> SURVIVED PHYSICAL FLIGHT
FAILED CONTAINMENT
HOST BOND: CONFIRMED
ENTITY #17 – STATUS: ESCAPED
FLIGHT 303 – STATUS: NEVER EXISTED




---

If you see a flight labeled “Manifest 303”—don’t board.
If you're already aboard—follow the rules. Or become one.

Shes right. I would have sacrificed a lot just to make her happy. She wanted 3 kids, I would have been happy with none but would have had kids just for her (I have one with previous marriage). She wanted to move to the country with less people, I like the city, etc. 

Anyway she ended it, I was hurt. Started dating almost immediately to get her out of my head. She knew it. Her friend saw me on a Dating site. 

She reached out a couple times I reached out a couple times as well. It was friendly and we never had any fights or shouting matches. Even when we broke up. A couple months after the breakup she asked for help and I met with her.

She asked me if I wanted to sleep over that night I helped her because it was already past midnight. I agreed and we slept in the same bed. I didn’t try anything with her, we’d already been broken up 2 months at that point. So we just slept. Next morning we sat for coffee and I broke down, told her I miss her, I love her, I’d still do anything for her. She said sorry but loves me , but not like that anymore. 

I sent her a message a month ago after asking her to give us another chance and she again said no sorry. 

I said ok… and sent her one last message. 
“I deleted our WhatsApp history and our FB chats. I’m sorry I keep trying to fix something you think is unfixable, It’s the downside to me having a big heart. I know who I am and what I can offer and I’m sorry you couldn’t see that. I just hope one day you can find someone who loves you as much as I loved you. Maybe I was too honest or too careful. I wish things would have been different. Consider this my final goodbye.”

Im finally over her, dating others to find the next partner. But was thinking of reaching out to her and letting her know I’m finally over things and have found happiness again. She was worried about me and sad to hurt me. Should I reach out? ",1,1753342797.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

✨PROMPT✨

FEMALE:

(Cinematic close-up portrait:1.6) of a deeply patient therapist mid-session, caught between serene professionalism and the creeping suspicion that their client just lied about being abducted by raccoons again. (The therapist is a woman in her early 40s, wearing wide-leg slacks, loafers, and a soft earth-toned cardigan over a blouse). (Her glasses are slightly askew from rubbing her temples too many times today, and she clutches a clipboard that’s been doodled on during a particularly intense vent session).



The office is cozy but clearly overworked—(piles of self-help books teeter on a coffee table next to a stress ball shaped like a screaming face). (A lava lamp burbles in the corner, surrounded by plants that are thriving solely out of spite). The walls are lined with inspirational posters like “You Are Enough” and “Take a Deep Breath,” but one has been vandalized to say “Take a Deep Nap.”



(Behind the therapist is a worn-out couch with suspicious stains and a throw blanket that's seen too much). A client’s legs are barely visible stretched out in the foreground, one sock dangling halfway off. (There’s a faint trail of cookie crumbs leading from the couch to a “Complimentary Snacks” bowl labeled “You earned this.”)



(The therapist’s expression is an award-winning mix of compassion, fatigue, and oh-god-not-this-again). Her pen is paused in the air like it’s unsure whether to take notes or just write “?????” and move on. Her nameplate reads “Dr. Monroe, Listener Extraordinaire,” and beside it is a mug that says “Empathy: Now 50% More Caffeinated.”



Lighting is warm and gentle, the golden hour sun bleeding softly through a frosted window. (The tone is warm, dry, and introspective—like a sitcom that occasionally makes you cry unexpectedly).



Style tags: warm lighting, dry humor, mid-session realism, cozy therapy office, emotionally saturated environment, candid storytelling.

1m7xzd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1m7xzd9/the_unwanted_lunas_bully_mates_summary_review_and/,"The Unwanted Luna's Bully Mates: Summary, Review and Reading Link","I’m walking into school behind my brother and Jason, one of his best friends. They really don’t pay any attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Anna makes them bring me. Anna is my nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really busy, so Anna was brought on to teach me how to ‘behave like a lady,’ which basically means teach me to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad doesn’t know that, as long as I make a good show when he’s around.  
  
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Killian and Zavier, the future Delta, Harry and the future Gamma Jason. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than some of the girls here.  
  
Anna told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not a big deal, but she didn’t believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we’re middle schoolers.  
  
What I have seen though is it’s more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids. They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It’s funny to think that some kids are popular, just for the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the Alpha’s kids friends. That’s the height of all popularity. My brother, Harry and Jason aren’t far behind being rank born. I, however, don’t matter, even though I am the Beta’s daughter and have Beta blood. I am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega. That is why Anna fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to stop it, not even my father.  
  
“Move it fatty. You’re taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you’re a wolf?” Natasha sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my armful of books.  
  
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my brother’s. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled his eyes and turned to walk away, Jason and Natasha following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.  
  
7th Grade:  
  
“Don’t you ever question my authority in front of another student again!” Natasha shoulder checks me into a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.  
  
“I didn’t question your authority, I told you that you can’t hit kids just because they are in your way. If you were late, that is not their fault.” I shouldn’t snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she’s starting to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father. Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.  
  
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding me up, but before I can get two steps, Bianca, one of Natasha’s little minions steps out to trip me, then proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we attracted a crowd.  
  
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. “Maybe if you trained a little harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn’t be so clumsy.” Natasha says not-so quietly to me then, “Hey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?” To my brother and his friends.  
  


Chapter 2

skylynn  
  
Fall of 8th grade  
  
“Come back here you little b\*tch.” A brunette goes flying by me with Barbie number 2, Leona, stomping after her awkwardly in her wedges and skirt so short and tight I wonder how she managed to keep all her bits covered making the smallest of movements, let alone attempted running. She looks livid and I can see the other two Barbies coming up behind her, strutting, since running or normal walking is not possible in the sky high shoes they are wearing.  
  
I don’t know what happened, but these three came back from their summer trip abroad and decided they were the queens of the school and normal rules of decency didn’t apply to them. They were never what anyone would call nice, but they didn’t outwardly harass people either.  
  
As the beta’s daughter it was my job to make sure all pack members were protected, even from our own. My father may not want me or take me seriously, my older brother was the true beta, but I took my rank and status seriously anyway since that is the one thing he beat into our heads since birth. We were not to embarrass him in any way as the Beta, the image was the most important thing to him.  
  
I step in front of Leona, hands up hopefully in a sign of peace. “Why are you chasing her? What did she do, Leona?”  
  
Leona almost falls over trying to stop her momentum in her sl\*tty getup.  
  
“She got me a D on my paper! That little b\*tch was supposed to make me sound smart and get me an easy grade. She purposely got me a bad grade to embarrass me in front of the new teacher. Get out of my way, skylynn.” She snarls at me and tries to push me out of the way looking at me like I am some piece of trash under her designer shoe.  
  
“Did you pay her to do a good job, or did you just pick a smart kid in your class and tell them they were doing your work?”  
  
“What does that matter? I am a warrior and she is just an omega. She is beneath me and should be glad I was talking to her in the first place.”  
  
“Her rank and yours have nothing to do with your school work, and last I checked you are no warrior. You are lazy, and don’t make time to train, let alone be considered competent. That’s your fault, do your own work. Leave her alone. She didn’t volunteer and you didn’t pay her, she owes you nothing.” I refuse to move from her path. I don’t have my beta aura yet, but I figure fake it until you make it right. I stand up as tall as I can, which is not much at my five foot nothing height, and keep stepping in her path as she tries to step around me, to keep her away from the girl. As a ‘warrior’ she should be more agile and be able to easily step around me, but training isn’t on this ‘warrior’s’ agenda.  
  
“You need to watch what you say to your betters, you murderer. You are not worth sharing breathing room with. Your dad thinks so, your brother thinks so. No one wants you around, so move.” Natasha sneers as she walks up and steps around Leona. Bianca, hot on her heels like the good little minion she is, forms the triangle they have decided makes them the most intimidating. I think they have seen Mean Girls too many times. “No one cares about you or your worthless opinions. No one in this pack humiliates us and gets away with it.”  
  
With that she shoves past me and heads straight for my brother and his friends. I know they heard what she said to me, werewolves have above average hearing, but as the Future Alphas, Beta, Gamma and Delta, they all have extraordinary hearing. They don’t even flinch at her hateful words. They believe if you can’t take a little criticism, you’re too weak to deal with in the first place. It’s not the first time she’s said those words to me, but they don’t hurt any less the longer I hear them. I blink back the tears burning my eyes, take a deep breath and head home. I hope the girl got away at least. I hope she can avoid those three, but I might have just prolonged the inevitable. I have a feeling this year is going to be a long one. I just need to keep my head down, keep my grades up and stay out of their way. Just a few more years and I can leave this hell hole.  
  
Fall of 9th Grade  
  
SLAM.  
  
Well, that hurt more than it normally does. A groan slips out of my mouth. I don’t remember the lockers biting back so hard. That’s what I’m thinking as I slide down to the floor with my eyes closed and feel the back of my head where it hit the locker, awaiting the next blow.  
  
“Happy Monday to you too.” I mutter to no one in particular.  
  
“You fat cow, stop getting in my way.” Natasha hisses at me before she slaps me. I can feel a little bit of blood trickle from the side of my mouth, she doesn’t hit that hard, but her fake nails are as sharp as cat claws. I can hear a couple chuckles and one is a little deeper than the others, that would explain the hard blow into the locker. She had one of the boys throw me this time. I don’t look around though, Natasha may skip all of our fight training, but she has proven she can provide torture in many other ways and there are plenty of people who want to be in her circle so bad that they will do anything to anyone to gain approval.  
  
“What did I do this time, your highness?” I ask sarcastically, risking a look up at her. I’m hoping to keep her attention long enough for the kid she was screaming at to run away. Natasha doesn’t get her hands dirty anymore, she found out quickly when you are popular or just plain evil, people will do just about anything to stay on your good side, in the hopes of vicarious status or to not be the next victim. Having her father on the school board helps too. None of her actions have ever been caught on camera, so there isn’t proof of anything she does, except the marks all over me, and she has everyone believing I am a weak nobody, that can’t take a hit or heal very quickly. A few kids have been suspended because of her. She harassed one so badly he moved away from our pack to go to school in a neighboring pack where his grandparents live. All because he wouldn’t break up with his girlfriend for her. We were in the fifth grade. Who is thinking about that in the fifth grade? No one talks about that though. The line the pack members believe or at least spread about is he needed extra guidance that the other school provides.  
  
“You do not stop me from disciplining a pup. That little toe rag purposely ruined my brand new designer shoes in front of the whole school. She deserves to be punished.” Natasha tosses her platinum bleached hair over her shoulder and rolls her crystal blue eyes at me like I am the dumbest person in the world for not understanding that. It wasn’t the ‘whole school’ it was my brother, the future beta, along with the future alphas, gamma and delta. Those five boys are rarely separated. She was trying to gain the attention of Zavier and Killian, our future alphas, like most of the girls in our school. Her little minions were focused on the other three, they didn’t really care which one gave them attention as long as they were noticed. As Bianca and Leona were ogling the guys, Bianca tripped over this little fourth grader and dumped whatever frufru iced coffee drink all down Natasha’s legs. Natasha will never admit when she and her friends are in the wrong though.  
  
The guys walk off chuckling, not even noticing the red tinge to Natasha’s eyes, showing she’s about to blow a gasket. Although, I don’t think she has ever shown them that side of her. She’s not dumb enough to show them her true colors. Her and her friends want to stay in the ranked circle. These boys rule the school like they think our parents rule this pack. They have no idea what they are actually doing, but they like the adoration, you can see it in their eyes. Acting tough and ‘leading by example,’ as they call it. If you want to be the best, act like it, until someone makes you prove it, then don’t lose.  
  
  
  


Chapter 3

I can’t blame Natasha and her friends for tripping over themselves around the future Alphas and their friends, really. The guys are a year ahead of us in school and just came back from summer training. Since they will all take over for their fathers when they graduate high school, they have been doing their respective rank training for the last two summers at a compound the Alpha King has on his castle grounds. They will train one month each summer for the rest of their high school career.  
  
I think the training keeps them from getting into trouble while they are out of school for the summer, but I’m sure they learn a lot too. They also get to build relations with the other future ranked members in our alliances and in our Alpha King’s territory. What could go wrong putting fifty or so high ranking teenage kids together for a whole month teaching them battle skills, strategy, pack maintenance? I’m sure it’s a pissing match the first few days.  
  
The Alphas learn about caring for the pack financially and dealing with disputes amongst members. They are the strongest in the pack and usually at frontline of defense when attacks happen and must put the pack first. The Beta’s job is to take on any responsibilities from the Alpha or Alpha’s that don’t need direct influence from the Alpha. The Beta is second in command and the Alpha’s right hand person. The Gamma’s job is similar to the Beta, but they are the Luna’s second in command and her prime protector. The Delta is the lead warrior, incharge of the packs defense and safety. They each have a job that is way more complicated and stressful than it sounds and many pack members, including the future ranked members, take for granted what goes on behind the scenes.  
  
I think that is why the ALpha King does his summer training, it pulls these ranked kids out of a childish setting like school and places them in a more real world situation. Some adapt better than others. I think the Alpha King also likes to know of friendships and rivalries early on, and what better way than to see them all in action, away from the influence of their parents. Our Alpha King does a good job of keeping the ridiculous pack leaders from causing trouble, but there is always someone trying to gain a better rank through alliances, treaties and forcing chosen mates on their children. Sometimes kids act better when the political aspirations are not a part of the training. There are several Alpha King’s throughout the word and they have a direct connection to the moon goddess herself through their Luna Queens. They are the full governing body for all werewolves, but work together when disputes or wars get too big for just one to handle.  
  
This year when the guys came back they were all almost unrecognizable. Each of them had a massive growth spurt and put on muscles like it was their job. They were all good looking before, even my brother, but now they looked like men, very very, hot men. They all stood over six feet tall and were as wide as a standard doorway. As they get closer to 18, their auras are developing as well, which has many uses. Their aura lets you know you are in the presence of a stronger wolf, they use it to command lower ranking wolves and it attracts s\*xual partners. A wolf’s goal is to have a strong mate to procreate with, the higher the rank, the stronger the wolf.  
  
All of the girls in the pack noticed and started throwing themselves at these guys. I think my brother has been out with a different girl every night since they have been back. Pretty sure the noises from his room late at night are him entertaining a few as well. It’s kind of gross to think of my brother like that, but all of them seem to have become manwh\*res. They aren’t the only ones, just the most notorious. Let’s just say the janitor’s closet gets a lot of use by the student population. I guess, though, if you can’t beat them, join them and these girls are willing participants.  
  
It was kind of sad really. We all have fated mates chosen for us by the moon goddess, I can’t imagine messing around and possibly gaining feelings for someone who might not be mine, that would suck to have them be all like ‘I love you, you’re the only person’ and then have the mate bond kick in with someone else and be kicked to the curb. I’ve seen it a few times here in the pack. It looks miserable. We can always take a chosen mate, and some packs do that for the higher ranking members, claiming bloodlines make the pack stronger, but I think the moon goddess has other plans and we are strongest with our given mate. I’m waiting around for mine.  
  
“Are you even f\*cking listening to me?”  
  
I shake my head of my random thoughts and look back at Natasha.  
  
“Not really, just leave the little kids alone, they don’t understand or care about your expensive shoes or that your friends can’t walk in theirs and need to be given a wide berth.” I say with as bored a tone as I can. The more emotions I show the longer the beatings last. “Besides your clumsy friend is the reason that pup tripped in the first place, but I don’t see you beating her down. Pick on people your own size.” Was my retort which earned me another slap. More blood runs from my lip. Just great, something I’ll have to hide at home for the next couple hours until it heals.  
  
At least I have my wolf to help now, last year trying to hide the bruises and cuts I got from Natasha and her girls was really hard. My father doesn’t pay much attention to me, he doesn’t even know I got my wolf at the end of 8th grade, right after my brother and all the guys, but he did notice the first time Natasha left marks on my arms and a small bruise on my cheek. He only noticed my arm when we had to make an appearance with the Alpha and I had a short sleeved dress on. He wasn’t as concerned for my health as he was his reputation as the beta with his daughter getting into fights and causing trouble with pack members or worse, being too weak to defend myself in training. He wouldn’t even listen to what happened. He sent me to my room without dinner and kept me home from school the following day until the bruise faded completely.  
  
It’s not that my father hates me. That’s a lie, I don’t want him to hate me. But he blames me for my mother’s death. He’s never said it directly to my face, but he rarely says anything directly to me, I have heard him make comments to others though. She died in childbirth with me and I don’t think he ever got completely over the loss of his mate. According to the nanny I had up until last year, I look just like her and that probably makes him a little sad at the constant reminder. My brother was better with me, we used to be really close, we’re not even a year apart, but ever since he started his training to become the next beta a couple years ago, he barely makes time for me, not even at school. They both put their duty to the pack and their Alphas above everything else including their personal lives.  
  
That, along with Natasha and her girls making sure everyone knows if they even talk to me, in what could be considered a friendly manner, she will find a way to punish them and me. My last year of middle school and now high school is shaping up to be pretty lonely. I just have to keep my head down, my grades up and train hard to get into warrior training and out of this pack.  
  
This wasn’t my first run in with Natasha this year and we have only been in school for two weeks, but this is where things really started to take a turn for me.  
  
  
  


Chapter 4

Natasha, Leona and Bianca find some way to torture me every single day after that. Some days it’s small things like taking a book out of my hands and shredding it all over the hallway while kids just stand around and watch or the time they pulled my ten page essay out of the pile we were handing forward in english and tearing it into small pieces and handing it back to me with a ‘whoops.’ I had it saved on my computer so I was able to reprint it, but the teacher marked it late and gave me only half credit even though she watched what happened.  
  
My father punished me for being lazy when he found out I handed in an assignment late, again not wanting to even hear my side of the story. I spent the weekend locked in my room, with no meals. It’s times like that when I really miss Anna, she would have snuck me something, even a granola bar. My brother was nowhere in sight when my father was berating me in the kitchen after school that day. Since Anna left he no longer has to pretend to watch out for me, even with our father.  
  
Other times it was physical. Pulling my hair and shoving me into doors and walls is a common favorite. In class, overly full backpack manage to knock me in the head at least once every class, which is why i try to be the last in and the first out when I can help it. She made sure no one ever hit me where marks could be easily seen. I’m pretty sure I have a couple ribs that have been broken so many times, a good sneeze would probably rebreak them. I won’t let my wolf waste energy on healing the small stuff, it’s not worth it, but she makes sure that I’m not in pain for long though. She really is great, her running commentary on the three Barbie wannabes help lift my mood, especially after some of the more harsh beat downs. Natasha knows I won’t let her harm kids in the school, especially the younger ones, she uses this as a way to get to me daily.  
  
My wolf and I have both decided this is for the best though. Even when she has the strongest kids beat on me, my beta lineage can handle it and we heal faster than Natasha thinks. It seems to keep her and her friends pacified to take their frustrations out on me and from targeting other kids in the school. As long as she thinks I’m isolated from everyone and let her pawns target me, she is happy, which means her friends are happy and there is peace in the school. If you can call a calm raving lunatic ‘peace.’  
  
Having my wolf made things less lonely. We figured out how to get out of my room without my father knowing, we hunt for food when he keeps it from me. It’s not so bad, I know that I can survive on my own and in the wild, which sounds nice some days.  
  
That’s what I thought until a new girl showed up mid November. She joined us at our mandatory 5am pack training. All kids in high school were required to train every morning before school to learn to protect themselves, even if you were not a warrior. As we got older the training was divided up into basic training for all pack members, intermediate training for patrols and advanced training for our elite warriors, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and their mates. The ranked members were the most targeted so they trained the most. They are also our strongest, so they tend to be on the frontlines of an attack.  
  
I loved training and went to every one I was allowed to attend, much to my brother’s irritation I was allowed to go to everything being a beta by blood. He would always give me dirty looks when I made eye contact with him. I don’t know why it bothered him and I didn’t really care. I kept my distance from him and all the guys and just did my own thing. I was only one of two females who chose to come to the extra trainings, Carra was a senior and was only here because her father, one of our elite warriors, made her. She came, trained, didn’t talk to anyone and left.  
  
The rest of the females were mates of our current leadership or warriors. The Luna was very nice and a great fighter, she always kept me on my toes and she and the other females would share stories and insights while we were sparring. I didn’t usually get to spar with the males during the elite training, the dads, including mine, were more interested in teaching their proteges. My dad actually did not even acknowledge I was there. But the Luna and the female warriors had some great tips on how to use my small size to my advantage, because many guys underestimate a woman in a fight. It amazed me how short sighted the guys could be. They cherished their mates, praised our female warriors and were feircely protective but in the end their actions showed they thought their ideas were better than a female’s and that they were the true protectors of the pack.  
  
Training was the only time I didn’t have to worry about Natasha, Leona and Bianca or any of their other minions messing with me. They weren’t dumb enough to cause the kind of scenes with me that they usually did with the future alphas, my brother and the rest of the future leaders watching. I could be free and be myself, in the back where no one could see me. I have often thought about doing warrior training following school. I even started running the patrol route around the territory in the mornings before training or after school if I need to avoid people or my house. We don’t have a lot of rogue attacks, but they do happen and our border patrol keeps us in close contact with neighboring packs in times of need. I have enjoyed getting to know the patrol warriors and learning what they do as the first line of defense for our pack.  
  
I am a good student, but that is more due to the pressure my dad puts on me to act like my high rank, than actually being smart or caring about school. I also have a ton of free time since I don’t hang out with anyone. Natasha has made sure that no one wants to associate with me on pain of social su\*cide.  
  
I was pulled from my thoughts as the lead trainer brought us all in and explained what we were going to do today and then casually said we have a new member joining us. “She is here with her uncle and aunt while her parents are working for the Alpha King.”  
  
That got everyone’s attention, including Natasha, who somehow managed to sit on the sidelines in her short dress and heels, clearly not participating today, like every other day, but she actually showed up today. I still haven’t figured out how she gets out of mandatory training.  
  
This tall girl walked in like she owned the place, her confident stature was what caught my eye first. Her youthful, carefree face, long dark brown hair and bright golden honey eyes told me she couldn’t be much older than me, but the way she held herself and how the eyes of every guy at training followed her very developed and toned body made me smile at the thought of how the Barbies were going to take having competition. I must have made a noise out loud, since she turned around and looked right at me. Delta Omar told her she could join the group and we would get her up to speed on what we were working on.  
  
Oh no! She walked right up to me and held her hand out. “Sella, nice to meet you.”  
  
I just stared at her blinking. It took me a second to register what I was supposed to do. She raised her eyebrow at me for my hesitation or complete lack of manners before I caught on. “Oh, sorry, skylynn.” I shook her hand. “I’m not used to people talking to me.” I muttered out awkwardly and quickly let go of her hand, turning back to the front where Delta Omar and the lead trainer were giving a few more instructions. Mentally smacking myself for sounding like an idiot. She looked at me questioningly, but before she could ask, our trainer divided us into pairs and had us start our warm-up and sparring. He must have decided I was as good a person as any to work with her since she chose me to talk to first and he knows I attend all the trainings we have. Delta Omar is one of the few people who knows that I want to train to get out of here so he lets me come to the gym and training grounds whenever I want, he even gave me a key to the gate when I started showing up before him.  
  
  
  


Chapter 5

Sella was a really good fighter, but so was I. She is really tall compared to me. She has to be like 5’7″ and my 5′ 1″ stature can’t compare, but we are built similarly which helps with learning the new movements. Her black sports bra and leggings accentuate all the tan and defined muscles in her body, she could be a supermodel with her curves. I have muscles too, and am actually pretty defined, but I prefer to not show much skin, it helps hide the injuries, so I tend to appear overweight. Today I have baggy sweatpants and t-shirt on. I also have a tank top on under the t-shirt.  
  
I learned the hard way my scars and bruising can be found in the heat of a match if I don’t have layers. I don’t want anyone to see them and pity me or pretend to try to help. It sounds stupid and my wolf an I have gone around and around, but I don’t want help from people who couldn’t be bothered to help me when I was recieveing the scars in the first place. It’s easy for them to make themselves feel better by offering help or assistance, saying I ‘just have to ask,’ but in reality they are the same people who turn a blind eye because their own self preservation is more important than doing what’s right. So I keep my pain hidden.  
  
I like to stay as invisible as possible, but I love sparring. I typically stick to the back of the training group and only work with warriors that are here to help Delta Omar train. He has seen my separation from the group and, I’m sure, has an idea why, so he makes sure there is a warrior there to partner with me.  
  
I don’t know if it’s me or my beta blood but the thrill and adrenaline rush of a good fight always makes my day better. I am actually a really skilled fighter, even though I let Natasha and her minions beat me up. It’s just better that she targets only me and not someone else who can’t take the abuse. I don’t fight back, I learned a long time ago that the beat down goes quick if they get bored.  
  
And I don’t get in trouble if I don’t throw any hits at all, since those do seem to show up on videos and leave marks for a long time. Kayley had a black eye for a week once not long after I got my wolf, it was chalked up to my beta blood and a lucky swing, I didn’t argue. But the punishment was terrible. I was suspended from school for the week and my dad locked me in my room and told Anna she wasn’t allowed to talk to me or feed me. She did neither of those things and she made sure I had all of my work and took my assignment’s to school for me so nothing was late. I wasn’t giving anyone any more reasons to punish me.

I (16F) got my first job working at a a coffee shop. The main reason I got this job was so that I wouldn’t have to ask my parents for money and so that I could do the things I enjoy (seeing my friends and going to concerts.) When I told my parents about the job, my mum (49F) said that she wanted some of the money out of my pay check. I brushed it off thinking of it as a joke and nothing more. As time went on, she, and my dad (53M) kept bringing the topic of me giving them money up, and even though I told them I was uncomfortable, they kept going. Before my mum went on a trip, she told me that if I got paid while she was gone, I needed to send her the money. I laughed and said nothing. I kept quiet when I got my first pay check of £600 but they somehow found out about it and keep pestering me. It is currently 8am for me and just 10 minutes ago my dad came down the stairs telling me to send him the money, and started calling me selfish. He started yelling at me that he’s been raising me my entire life and I can’t give him my first pay check, which really upset me because he’s very verbally abusive and literally only does the bare minimum, and the thing is, I get paid once a month which means that I need to use my money wisely. I think I would see the situation a little differently if my parent’s love for me wasn’t conditional. I’m a lesbian and my parents are extremely religious, to the point where they’d most definitely disown me once I come out (which I will do when I’m financially stable.)

She was my safe space, the one person who truly got me.

It wasn’t just gossip.  
It was betrayal—deep, personal, soul-piercing betrayal.

I wanted to scream.  
I wanted revenge.  
But more than anything… I wanted to understand **why** someone I loved would hurt me like that.

I searched online for comfort. But it all felt shallow.  
Then, I typed into Bible Chat AI:

That verse broke me.

Jesus didn’t just preach love—He lived it in the face of betrayal.  
He knew how it felt.  
And He chose compassion… not bitterness.

I’m not there yet.  
But I’m trying.

Some days I still feel the sting.

God doesn’t dismiss betrayal—but He teaches us how to heal through it.

But, I think my anxiety initiated the palpitations and health anxiety but now I feel it has to be something other?

There's no crushing pain and it's not severe....but it does play on my mind and I'll get a rush of adrenaline freaking out which almost makes me breathless with a racing heart, but after a few minutes I'm ok again. 

Because of the timeframe (on and off over a year) I'm thinking maybe angina? I'm a 40yo male.

1m7xsfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IXdatascience/comments/1m7xsfz/how_can_voice_ai_agents_deliver_more_personalized/,How Can Voice AI Agents Deliver More Personalized and Human Like Interactions?,"Recently, voice artificial intelligence agents have thoroughly revolutionized how people interact on digital platforms, fostering a significant shift towards personalized human-like communication. Sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques empower advanced systems designed to mimic human conversations by understanding user queries quite effectively. Demand for intuitive user experiences grows rapidly, and the ability of voice AI agents to deliver bespoke interactions becomes crucial in artificial intelligence research. Technological advancements in the dynamic AI domain enable natural interactions and emphasize the importance of emotional intelligence in creating engaging user experiences nowadays.

Voice AI agents might greatly enhance personalization across different applications, including customer service representatives and smartphone personal assistants. [**AI Agents**](https://www.intellectyx.com/services/ai-agent-development/) can personalize responses promptly, leveraging data analytics and language processing with individual user preferences and past interactions in mind. Relevant responses in real-time increase trust and user satisfaction, unlike the trained robotic responses that are limited to answers. Organizations increasingly recognize the value in personalized interactions, so integration of voice AI agents into applications redefines human-computer interaction, making it more intuitive and aligned with human nuances.

# Here are Some Industry-wise Situations Showcasing Personalized AI Interactions

* **Healthcare:** Healthcare applications and medical advisors online integrate [**AI voice agents**](https://www.intellectyx.com/ai-voice-agent/) to interact with customers anytime, giving personalized responses such as medical advice, reminders for medication, and personalized health tips based on individual patient data and history.
* **Retail:** Retail is one highly customer-oriented industry where customer reviews, feedback, and responses hold great value in building brand credibility. That’s where AI chatbots help customers get recommendations, update on promotional offers, note customer records, and make them feel heard during the whole interaction.
* **Finance:** Financial companies can make the best use of AI-powered voice assistants to offer customized financial plans and suggest investment strategies based on the client information derived from data analytics. This will help the customers to understand their financial goals and risk factors, if any.
* **Education:** Human-like conversation with AI voice assistants simplifies the student journey in terms of understanding the course materials, assessments, and is accordingly supportive of learning styles to achieve better results.
* **Travel and Hospitality:** Travel-based applications integrated with AI voice assistants help travellers to personalize their plans with location recommendations, itinerary planning, and customer service. The responses are based on the past customer behavior and preferences derived from the analytics record.

# Real-time Examples of Human-like AI Conversations

# Example 1:

One of the favorite coffee shops in the area has recently installed a new self-service kiosk powered by human-like AI. Customers delightfully start using the digital self-help machine where the AI kiosk greets customers with a warm smile and says, “Good Day, Ms.XYZ! How can I help you today?” Impressed with the AI’s ability to recognize the cafe’s old customer, she adds her order request, saying, “One classic cold coffee, please.” The AI assistant prompt replies, “Cold coffee is a good choice for this hot weather.” Next, it asks the customer for add-ons. “Would you like to have a slice of cake or a cookie along with the coffee?” Customer is happy with the quick suggestion, excitedly says, “Yes, why not!” While the order is being processed, the customer is not left alone; instead, the AI is still in touch, asking about the weekend plans and similar light conversations. This interaction clears the air about humans interacting with AI chatbots that respond very much like humans.

# Example 2:

Patients are looking for timely responses to act fast and stabilize their health. A patient visits the website of a hospital in the vicinity and connects with the AI virtual agent to inquire about their current health condition -” I have been feeling lethargic lately, even after sleeping well and working less.” The AI replies in a caring tone, “I am sorry to know that you are not keeping well.” “Can you list down your symptoms with details?” On hearing the patient’s details, AI clears the doubt about potential conditions, recommends relevant medical attention, and helps with self-care tips, all this in a supportive tone.

# What is the Difference Between AI-powered Voice Assistants and Non-AI Chat Assistants Online?

AI-powered voice assistants differ from non-AI chat assistants mainly in underlying technology and functionality. AI-powered voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri leverage advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to conversationally respond to user queries. They decipher voice commands quickly and learn heaps from user interactions, providing super personalized responses rooted deeply in context.

Non-AI chat assistants rely heavily on pre-defined scripts and rigid rule-based systems for handling various customer inquiries. Such systems offer restricted interactivity and frequently falter when confronted with novel queries or subtle contextual nuances. AI-powered voice assistants offer a more dynamic experience capable of handling a wider range of tasks, adapting rather fluidly to user needs.

# Emotional Intelligence in AI Voice Assistants – Benefits

* **Enhanced User Experience:** AI voice assistants feature emotional intelligence capabilities that help to understand the user’s state of mind/ mood, and responses are tweaked accordingly to strike personalized conversations.
* **Improved Communication:** AI voice assistants take the customer interactions far from being technical and are not restricted to fixed replies. Based on the customer query or feedback, the tone of the conversation is set so that the customer is not misunderstood in any way and given clear information.
* **Increased User Satisfaction:** When you are new to a website or an application and meet a pleasant AI agent to answer all your queries, understand your past experiences, and devise buying solutions that perfectly match. This increases user satisfaction.
* **Adaptive Learning:** An emotionally active AI virtual assistant is empathetic towards users and improves the quality of user interactions over time. This adaptability to understand individual preferences and emotional needs can enhance the conversations with customers online.
* **Conflict Resolution:** Frustrated users often vent anger loudly, and an emotionally intelligent voice assistant de-escalates tension by responding rather calmly and quite empathetically. Conflict management skills can sustain customer relationships with various technologies and significantly improve the overall user experience over time.

# Why Should Companies Encourage Real-time Voice Assistants

The advent of real-time voice assistants has elevated the quality of [**customer service**](https://www.intellectyx.com/customer-service-ai-agent/) while reducing manual errors and unpleasant experiences caused by human agents. A sense of customer engagement is higher due to the immediate response to customer queries, thereby reducing wait times. The AI agents converse naturally, just like a human agent would talk, generating intuitive interactions. Besides, real-time voice AI can analyze customer sentiment and adapt responses accordingly, leading to more personalized service.

Another reason why companies should encourage the adoption of real-time voice assistants is because it reduces the load of human agents and curbs operational costs, retaining levels of productivity. Customers no longer trust the technical conversations with chatbots that reply only to set questions. Real-time AI conversations are dynamic and widely accepted in the digital marketplace.",2,1753341579.0,u_IXdatascience,1,1.0,False

In the past couple weeks, I've walked around so many neighborhoods doing an especially long list of errands. Piedmont Avenue, Dimond and Laurel District, Park Boulevard, Broadway Shopping Mall place with the giant Safeway, Grand Avenue, Jack London, Lakeshore... all places in the ""bourgeoisie"" parts of Oakland. I mean, some more than others of course.

I have begun to understand that living in Oakland means living in a place that can sometimes look like The Good Place, but it's really The Very, Very Bad Place. It looks like a regular town on the surface with yogurt shops and civic infrastructure, until you pay closer attention and see that there's crime happening almost everywhere, all the time.

And I realized this week that, physically, I no longer feel safe walking around Oakland, even in the so-called fancy areas. I realized that every time I'm in a public place in Oakland, my body goes into overdrive: scanning my environment, estimating possible dangers, feeling worried and vigilant about my bag, my parked car, my dog when he's with me, my safety walking to and from the store with packages, my well-being, whether it be theft or gun violence or dangerous driving. 

I know the reason this happens is because the crime stopped feeling distant or hypothetical in the past few years. It's not just a tired reputation from the 90s anymore. I have myself experienced or had close friends/family members experience it, from car robberies to broken windows to snatch-and-grabs, and everyday I read from my neighbors (neighbors whom I actually know and trust, not just NextDoor, though I don't think NextDoor is such a bad resource, it's just really random) about thefts, hit and runs, snatch-and-grabs, home invasions, shootings. Like most Oaklanders, I really, really have stories.

When I had to do errands over in Marin, Lafayette and Palo Alto over the last couple weeks, it was a shocking change: to have the weight taken off my shoulders because I wasn't hyper-vigilant about crime. I could really relax. I went to a Starbucks and drank a coffee out on the patio and wrote in my notebook and didn't feel the need to check on my car every 2 minutes even though I had locked every door. The chances of theft happening were very low, and my regular common sense awareness was more than enough to handle the natural risk. It was such a relief and such a wake-up call.

This has all gone a long way to convincing me that staying in Oakland is doing damage to my nervous system and that it's time for me, a 4th-generation Oaklander, to move to a city that lets me feel safe.

I guess I'm sharing this because it's such a private feeling and I want to know if any other people know what I'm talking about. Thank you.",4,1753341385.0,OaklandCA,7,0.7,False

Given the somewhat dearth of good specialty options in DE (Falcon Micro is ok, but usually just like three to five options in their webstore), it seems like the only way to get at bigger and better stuff would be to go all in for a 60-70kg bag. (and save money as 8-10/ kg is a lot better than what I usually pay)

I usually roast 30kg or so per year, so it would make sense to try to split the costs on these. Also, the Hamburg warehouses do have stock, so pickup / shipping wouldn't really be a problem.

I already do the usual stuff, compare insurance annually, cook at home most nights, pay off my credit card each month, avoid impulse buys, etc.

But I still like good coffee (made at home). I have a favorite mid-range olive oil I won’t swap out. I’d rather find savings in areas I don’t care as much about so I can still afford those quality items that matter to me.

I’m not looking for “ditch the lattes” advice, I’m looking for the less obvious, possibly weird-but-brilliant, frugal hacks you’ve discovered that preserve your lifestyle while freeing up cash in the background.

For example, here are a few things I already do:

- I learned to repair loose stitching in clothes and shoes instead of replacing them.
- I batch errands so I barely ever need to top up fuel mid-week.
- I use FB marketplace where I can for furniture and kids seasonal clothes etc.

So: what are your under-the-radar savings moves? Where do you quietly cut back so you can spend on what matters?

Would love to hear what’s worked for others!

I've developed a small web app that corrects text you write in a foreign languages to have an immediate feedback on language errors. There are a lot of more features I could implement, but I want to nail that one first before moving to the next one.

Regardless I would like you to get some feedback from you regarding the landing page and the usability. Feel free to write me an DM and I give you full access to the app.

One big pain and advantage at the same time is the unique UI. My idea is to have an immersive experience as if someone is studying a new language at a coffee shop. But since the elements are hidden in object and not as clear as in usual websites I believe some people will have problems to fully use it.

1m7xbmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1m7xbmr/what_to_do_in_austin_for_3_hours/,What to do in Austin for 3 hours?,"I just got back from spending a weekend in Austin, and I want to share how I made the most of a quick 3-hour window in the city. If you're short on time like I was, here's what worked really well for me.

I discovered that the best way to see Austin's highlights efficiently is taking the Double Decker Austin Sightseeing Tour. It's a 90-minute tour that covers all the major spots, and you don't have to deal with parking or navigation. Plus, sitting on the open-air top deck gives you amazing photo opportunities.

What really surprised me was how much ground we covered. We cruised past the historic 6th Street (where all the live music happens), saw the impressive Texas State Capitol building, and checked out the famous Congress Avenue Bridge where thousands of bats emerge at sunset. The guide shared fascinating stories about each location - stuff you wouldn't find on Google.

After the tour, I had about an hour left, which was perfect for exploring South Congress (SoCo). This area is packed with unique local shops, food trucks, and some great spots for photos with the Austin skyline in the background. I grabbed a quick taco and some local coffee, which really completed the Austin experience.

Here's what I learned from my short visit:

1. Book the tour in advance - it often sells out, especially on weekends
2. Bring sunscreen (though they provide some on the bus)
3. Wear comfortable shoes for walking around SoCo afterward
4. Bring a water bottle (they provide water, but extra doesn't hurt)
5. Have your camera ready - there are tons of great photo ops

I found the best deal for the tour here: https://athometouch.com/austin 

The price is reasonable (around $37), and you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change. The tour starts at the Austin Visitor Center, which is super easy to find.

One thing I really appreciated was how the guides (all locals) gave recommendations for restaurants and hidden gems to check out later. They even pointed out spots where famous movies were filmed and shared interesting historical facts about the University of Texas and the Governor's Mansion.

For anyone wondering if it's worth it - absolutely. You get a great overview of the city, learn a bunch of interesting facts, and still have time to explore a bit on your own. It's particularly useful if you're visiting Austin for the first time or have limited time like I did.

A quick tip: If you're visiting during summer, try to book an earlier tour when it's cooler. The top deck is amazing, but Austin can get pretty hot in the afternoon.

This tour really helped me make the most of my limited time in Austin. In just three hours, I felt like I got a solid introduction to the city's culture, history, and layout. Would definitely recommend this approach if you're short on time but want to experience the essence of Austin.

Remember to use that booking link I shared above - it's got the best rates I could find and their customer service was really helpful when I had questions before the tour.",1,1753339859.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False
1m7xbju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1m7xbju/my_fan_write_of_the_next_mcu_spiderman_trilogy/,My fan write of the next MCU Spider-Man trilogy.,"I wanted to share my take on the upcoming Spider-Man MCU trilogy. Some of this I’ve put a lot of thought into, some of it I’ve just vaguely considered (like the names of the movies lol), but I’d love to know what people think!


**Spider-Man Brand New Day:**

Peter’s at NYU, he’s struggling to make it to class, he’s struggling to pay his rent working his job as a pizza guy or picking up some freelance work for the daily bugle providing footage of Spider-Man for Jonah’s show. Why’s he struggling? Cause he’s out there being the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. This is the premise of how things are looking in his life right now.

In terms of the story, main antagonist of the first movie is Wilson Fisk. The movie should be focused on ground level crime, as Peter is thwarting Kingpin’s men, which he has no idea how these crimes are linked. Early on, he runs into a cat burglar, who manages to catch him off guard with her skills in acrobatics, fighting, and flirtatious banter, Black Cat escapes with the jewels she was lifting. 

The next day, Peter shows up late to class and sits next to a girl in his class, Felicia Hardy. We don’t see Black Cat again in this movie, but we see Felicia and Peter interacting and getting to know each other. 

Back to Spider-Maning, as Peter continues to crack down on Fisk’s men, Daredevil shows up. He explains to Peter what’s going on, and that these crimes have all been linked to Fisk. The two of them team up to keep going after Fisk’s operations. The inevitable lead up is a battle between the two of them against Fisk, putting Spidey on Fisk’s radar. The fight ends with them defeating Fisk, but Daredevil explains the fight is far from over, there’s still going to have to be a legal battle. Setting up a cool season for Daredevil focused on Matt taking on Fisk as a lawyer while trying to stop and link Fisk’s operations to him as Daredevil.

**Spider-Man Days After:**

Battle world stuff happens between first and second. Peter gets the venom symbiote on battle world, and in the second movie, that’s the suit he’s wearing. The suit isn’t making him bad. Not yet at least. What it is doing, is making him more effective, and efficient, allowing him for a moment in time to act as Spider-Man and Peter Parker with little problem. Early in the first part of the movie, Felicia and Peter have a first date. Then, Black cat and Spider-man start having more run ins. 

As time is passing, Felicia is staying at Peter’s apartment one night, and she finds his old suit. This starts a fight between the two of them out of costume in Peter’s apartment. As the fight happens there’s a lot of back and forth as the two of them share their own ideologies of why they do what they do. 

In this iteration, Felicia’s father had been a member of New York’s elite, a place he’d earned by acting as their secret operative against their enemies, the one who got his hands dirty. Of course, they turned on him, and he was ruined. Her father became a cat burglar, stealing from the people who ruined him, and he taught everything he knew to Felicia, teaching her to fight against those in power, and to claw her way up to a life of luxury and happiness.

At the conclusion of the fight, Felicia leaves, mad at Peter, and calling him self righteous. This is where things start to change, as the fight between the two of them upsets Peter, it also upsets the Symbiote. 

Peter withdrawals from his healthier lifestyle, and goes head first into his crime fighting, growing more aggressive. Something he fails to notice within himself. But the media hasn’t. Jonah starts going to town on Spider-Man like never before. This pushes Peter to quit his job at the bugle. He’s showing up for classes, just enough to not get dropped from NYU, and we see Felicia looking at him, with a worried look on her face. She tries to talk to him after class, but he ignores her, and says he doesn’t have time for criminals like her. 

Following this, Spider-Man arrives at the scene of a break in, finding Black Cat waiting for him. She tells him that she’s worried about him. He’s not acting like himself. Something’s wrong with him, and it’s not just their break up. A fight ensues between the two, where she figures out that his new black suit is an alien. She tells him he needs to get the suit off, that it might be affecting him. Peter laughs the idea off, and starts to leave, at that point Peter accidentally sets off the building’s burglar alarm, which causes the symbiote to freak the fuck out. Felicia’s freaking out about what’s happening to Peter, and she recognizes that they need to get out of there, she grabs him and they both escape the building, Peter’s exhausted after the fight and the symbiote’s reaction to the high frequency sound. Felicia helps him home.

The two of them have a conversation, Peter asks her why she bothered helping him. She tells him, despite their fight, and their differing ideals, she cares about him. She understands why he does what he does. He was the one who pushed her away. She’s worried about him, and now she’s worried that there’s a creature symbiotically attaching itself to him, and warping him. Peter, out of the suit, starts to recognize what she’s saying. Starts to see what’s really going on. The two of them start to make up, and their relationship seems to be becoming mended, with Peter saying he’ll go ask some friends to run some tests on the suit.

Peter arrives at the Baxter Building, having met the Fantastic Four during the events of Battle world. He asks Reed to examine the suit. Reed in turn gives him a Fantastic Four suit and a paper bag to cover his face, knowing Spider-man’s hesitant to reveal his identity. After examining the suit, Reed is able to identify its nature, and tells Peter it’s good that he can’t to him when he did, and that the suit would have eventually turned him into a monster. 

Reed hangs onto the suit. Peter leaves in his bombastic bag man outfit, which we see as Peter is showing the footage on his phone to Jonah, as he’s asking for his job back. Jonah agrees, but tells him he’s got competition now, as Eddy Brock steps onto the scene. They’re friendly, and Eddy invites Pete to grab lunch with him. 

As they talk, Eddy reveals his grand ambitions, explaining that ever since Peter left, he’s been doing more than just taking pictures and videos of the Web Slinger, that he’s been trying to uncover Spider-Man’s secret identity, figuring that he can use that information to launch his career to greater heights. Peter wishes him luck, and Eddy says he doesn’t need luck, he’s got something better. 

Peter and Felicia are at his apartment together, watching a movie, piles of textbooks and takeout on the table in front of them, some big threat (let’s say the celestials) suddenly hits new york, and Peter runs to grab his fantastic four suit and his old spider-man mask, as he still hasn’t fixed up his old suit which had been damaged severely on battle world. Felicia tells him to hold on, she has something for him. She presents him with a new version of his old suit, replacing the vibrant blue with black, and a large white spider logo, sort of a mix of the playstation suit design and the Spider-man Beyond suit that Ben Reilly wore. 

He gives Felicia a kiss, and he leaves.

The final scene shows Eddy walking into his own apartment, as it’s revealed that the piece of venom from the sonyverse that was left behind found and attached itself to this world’s Eddy, and he has a board set up with all his investigation information on it, at the center Peter Parker’s name is circled.

I know what you’re thinking, there was no antagonist of that movie… yuh. Wouldn’t it be cool to have a Spider-Man movie that wasn’t a typical action movie, but instead was a Superhero drama focused on character and world development? I think so.

**Spider-Man Darkest Days:**

Post whatever event happened with the celestials. This one I have the least thought out, essentially the villain would be Eddy Brock as Venom. It would be revealed that Eddy knew Peter was Spider-Man through the symbiote, and that he’s trying to get enough evidence to prove it, which now he’s trying to do by going after Spider-Man directly by endangering people to force him out. The two would fight a few times early on, and Peter would lose each time, pushing Peter to steal back his symbiote from the Baxter Building; feeling like he’s not strong enough to stop Eddy. Johnny Storm would try to stop him, it’d be an action scene showing off their friendship, with Peter successfully getting the symbiote back after the fight. The final fight between Spider-Man and Venom would result in Eddy’s other-universe symbiote combining with Peter’s driving the symbiotes both insane, and turning Peter into a monsterous version of venom that completely takes him over. Felicia and the Human Torch would team up to save Peter from the symbiote, but in the ensuing fight, venom would kill Felicia. Johnny would save Peter from venom. 

We’d see Felicia’s funeral, Peter’s graduation from NYU, and all the while Peter’s going through it hard. We’d cut to Peter sitting on his bed. Holding his mask tightly, there’s a knock at the window, and Johnny’s there, he comes in, they talk about the fight. It’s revealed that Peter hasn’t suited up in months. Johnny tries to convince him that Felicia’s death wasn’t his fault, but Peter tells him he know’s that’s not true. Johnny tried to stop him from taking the suit for that exact reason. Johnny tells him “You told me what happened to your Aunt May. How she told you that great power comes with great responsibility. You did what you thought would save lives Pete. You’re not that monster. New York needs its friendly neighborhood Spider-Man back.”

He leaves Peter alone to think. Peter leaves to grab coffee. As he enters, guess who’s back working the counter? Michelle Jones. Peter’s stunned, he orders coffee, she says he looks familiar, and he says he’s just got one of those faces probably. She goes to grab his coffee, and when she comes back he’s changed his mind saying he thinks he does recognize her. He askes if she went to Midtown High, and they reintroduce each other, talking about how it’s been so long, and they can barely remember anyone from back then. She tells him she just moved back from MIT, but that she’s a little nervous now. He asks why, and she tells him that part of why she felt okay coming back to New York, given all the crazy stuff that goes on there, is because of heroes like Spider-Man, but that no one’s seen him in months, and it makes her feel a little less safe knowing the Amazing Spider-Man’s gone. That shocks Peter, and Mj steps away to take another order. We sit with Peter there, as he processes those words. 

We see him walk back into his apartment. Slowly he grabs his mask, he looks out his window, takes a deep, shuddering, breath, and we cut to a final swing. Bringing the Friendly Neighborhood trilogy to an end, and moving towards a fully adult Amazing Spider-Man.",1,1753339851.0,Spiderman,0,1.0,False

## What is Arbitrox?

Arbitrox is an **automated trading platform** powered by artificial intelligence. It’s designed to help users trade assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks without needing to manually execute trades. Think of it like having a super-smart assistant who monitors the market 24/7 and acts instantly when the time is right.

The platform uses **algorithms** to analyze market trends and make decisions based on pre-set parameters. You can either let it do its thing automatically or set up your own trading strategy. It’s ideal for people who want to trade but don’t have the time (or nerves) to do it manually.

## Who Created Arbitrox?

The creators of Arbitrox aren’t exactly front and center, which is pretty common with these types of platforms. From what I could dig up, the platform seems to be developed by a **team of fintech engineers and crypto enthusiasts** with experience in building algorithmic trading systems.

While the anonymity might seem sketchy at first, it’s actually not out of the ordinary in the crypto space. Many similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge** operate the same way. That said, it would be nice to have a bit more transparency on the team behind the tech.

## How Does Arbitrox Work?

Arbitrox works by using AI and machine learning to scan the markets in real-time. It looks for patterns, news events, and price movements to decide when to buy or sell. You can set your risk level, choose which assets you want to trade, and even define stop-loss and take-profit levels.

Here’s the basic process:
- You deposit funds into your account
- Select your preferences or use the default settings
- The bot starts scanning and executing trades automatically
- Profits (or losses) are reflected in your dashboard

It’s basically **hands-off trading**, but with the option to tweak things if you’re more experienced or want more control.

## Arbitrox Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s where Arbitrox shines, and where it still has room to grow:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully automated trading
- ✅ Supports multiple asset types (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ Low minimum deposit ($250)
- ✅ Beginner-friendly UI
- ✅ Real-time market data
- ✅ Customizable strategies
- ✅ Demo account for testing

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not regulated by major financial authorities
- ❌ No transparency on the development team
- ❌ Still requires monitoring for high volatility markets
- ❌ Limited educational resources

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Arbitrox?

Arbitrox is designed to be **cross-platform**. You can use it on:
- **Desktops** (Windows, macOS)
- **Tablets**
- **Mobile devices** (iOS and Android)

The mobile interface is surprisingly good. I tested it on my Android phone and it was smooth, responsive, and had all the features of the desktop version. Perfect for checking trades while on the go or during a coffee break.

## Arbitrox – Supported Countries

From what I’ve seen, Arbitrox works in **most countries**, but there are a few exceptions due to regulatory restrictions. It’s available in:

- North America (except some U.S. states)
- Most of Europe
- Asia
- Australia
- Latin America
- Africa (selected regions)

If you’re in the U.S., you might want to double-check if your state supports it, as platforms like this often face restrictions in places like New York or Hawaii.

## Arbitrox – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform uses **AI to scan markets 24/7**, analyzing both technical indicators and real-world events. It’s like having a team of analysts working non-stop in the background.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, Arbitrox is **ridiculously easy to use**. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and not overloaded with confusing charts unless you want them.

### Mobile Accessibility

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **alerts and notifications** based on price thresholds, trade executions, or market events. Super handy if you want to stay in control without being glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Crypto is the main focus, but Arbitrox also supports **forex, commodities, and stocks**. If you’re looking to diversify, this platform has you covered.

## Is Arbitrox a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t look like a scam**.

Yes, it’s unregulated—but so are most crypto trading bots. The platform is functional, provides a demo account, and users (including myself) have seen actual trades and results. It’s **not a get-rich-quick scheme**, and it doesn’t promise unrealistic returns.

However, always proceed with caution. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile markets.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Arbitrox?

You’ll need to deposit **at least $250** to get started. This is pretty standard for platforms like this. It’s enough capital for the AI to execute trades but not so much that it feels risky for beginners.

### Arbitrox Customer Support

Customer support is **available 24/7** via live chat and email. I tested the chat feature and got a response in under 3 minutes. They’re polite, knowledgeable, and not overly pushy (which is rare in this space).

## How do you start trading on Arbitrox?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Arbitrox website and click “Sign Up.” You’ll need to enter your name, email, and phone number. The whole process takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signing up, you’ll get a call from a “broker” to verify your identity (standard stuff). Then you can fund your account with the $250 minimum using a credit card, debit card, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can dive into the dashboard. Choose between demo mode or live trading. Adjust settings if you want, or let the bot handle everything.

## How to Delete an Arbitrox Account?

If you ever want to delete your account, just contact support via email or chat. They’ll walk you through the process. Make sure to withdraw any remaining funds before doing this.

## The Verdict

Arbitrox is one of the **better AI trading platforms** I’ve tested recently. It’s user-friendly, supports multiple assets, and offers a solid balance between automation and control. The lack of regulation and team transparency is a downside, but not a dealbreaker if you’re cautious.

If you’re looking for a way to **dip your toes into automated trading without coding skills**, Arbitrox is a pretty solid place to start.

I’d recommend starting with demo mode, testing your settings, and scaling up only if you’re comfortable. It won’t make you rich overnight—but it might just help you **trade smarter**.

So I have bipolar, depression and GAD. I have a psychologist and psychiatirst and I'm on a whole bunch of meds to stabilise me.

Recently fell into a depressive episode where I could barely get out of bed so I started drinking coffee again. I had previously quit coffee because of the anxiety symptoms it was giving me. And yes I am now out of bed, not ""depressed"", but now I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety symptoms again like sweating, heart palpitations, diarhea.

If I don't drink coffee then I'm depressed and can't work.

If I do drink coffee I can work, but I feel like absolute rubbish.

I thought to myself as I walked around my SUV. He promised to be here and help. Mike, my husband, was nowhere to be seen. I sighed and shrugged. It was hard enough having to load the ten bags of flour by myself, but now I was going to have to bring them into the bakery as well. I would have tried the mate bond to contact him, but he had been ignoring me more than usual lately.

Our bond was not really stable to begin with, not being fated mates and all. I had hoped though that Mike was truthful to me when he persued me those three years ago. Fresh out of culinary school and with some money saved to open my bakery, Mike had been one of my first customers- and my first lover. He claimed that even though we weren’t fated, he would persue me to the ends of the earth.

Two months later; and I finally caved under the full moon during a rut for him. It was not my intention to lose my virginity that night, but something had made me feel wound up that evening during the pack run. Mike just happened to be nearby when I couldn’t take the itch anymore.

Under the full moon, we had rutted our brains out for hours on a starlit patch of grass. It might have been my first time, but Mike had been gentle at first. His d\*\*k was a decent size too, I had thought at the time. And Mike had no issue performing, especially during the rut. But something had been missing.

Now after three years, I was tired and always disappointed in Mike. It was like after we tied the knot- I was of no use to him anymore. It was almost like he had enjoyed the chase more than he enjoyed me. Our s\*x life was all but existent anymore. Up until two months ago, at least he would get the urge to bend me over and go to town on an all day session of love maybe twice a month if I was lucky. He always finished way before I could even orgasm- leaving me wanting and annoyed as he would pass out almost instantly.

Now with a two month dry spell- and barely even a kiss on the cheek here or there, I was strung up on need and tired from working to cover his shift in the bakery as well.

I went to the back door of the bakery and propped it open. Maybe I could get Tiffany to help me. Her best friend’s car was parked in its usual spot near the dumpster. It wasn’t her shift to work the counter today, but maybe she was just stopping in for a cookie or something.

Picking up the first fourty pound bag of flour, I made my way into the back of the store and to the storage room.

At first, I thought I heard some muffled voices from somewhere in the bakery, maybe it was a customer out front with the cashier. I made my way to the storage door and pushed it open.

“Oh, God! Mike, Harder!” I stood still, shocked at the sight in front of me. On the pallet of sugar to the side, Mike and Tiffany were hard at work on each other. Mike’s ass bounced up and down as Tiffany’s legs were spread to either side of his hips, garishly up in the air like she was a paid porn star. The wet sounds of slapping filled the air as Mike grunted away inside her friend.

“Mike?” I gasped shocked. The bag of flour I was carrying was forgotten as I dropped it from my grasp. It hit the floor with an audible thud as the bag split and flour permeated the air.

Mike and Tiffany stopped immediately and tried to cover themselves. Mikes p\*\*\*s bobbed about, swaying back and forth as he scrambled to cover himself. Flour was starting to gather on every surface, including his p\*\*\*s. It dusted it like a fresh layer of snow, mixing with the wet after effects of s\*x.

“Babe, it’s not what it looks like…” Mike stammered as he pulled up his pants.

“Not what it looks like? Not what it looks like! Oh, so you’re not f\*\*\*\*\*g with my best friend over the sugar for the store?” I shouted at the top of my voice. “ No wonder you haven’t wanted to touch me, you fat pig! And you, Tiffany, what the f\*\*k?! You were supposed to be my best friend who I counted on, and here you are shagging my husband!”

Tiffany scoffed, “ Best friend? yeah right. The only reason I have ever been around is for Mike. He would’ve been with me sooner, but he needed to get you out of his system first. f\*\*k, I even snuck you an aphrodisiac those three years ago so you would finally give yourself up. Then he feels guilty because you were a virgin and of course he had to marry you to make it right. Now after three years, I’m finally taking my Mike back you cow. He has always been my fated mate!” Tiffany’s face was red from yelling, matching mine from anger.

Staff from the kitchen and the front of the store had started to gather and watch the spectacle. The flour had finally settled down and the mess was everywhere.

“You drugged me!?” I was in shock. It all made sense now. I had never had the need to take anyone before that night, and Mike had never really been her type. The only real reason we had even married was because of the taboo in wolf culture. Taking a virgin on a full moon was considered proposing and swearing an oath to mate after. No one really followed that now days, but most of the pack was more traditional than anything.

I hung my head. Of course I was blind and naïve back then, fresh out of high school- straight to college- and never really making any friends.

“Get the f\*\*k out.” I whispered dejectedly. Mike began to stammer. “No, no excuses. I Melody Swanson, reject you Micheal Swanson, as my mate and spouse.” The sting hurt; but I knew it was worth it. “Accept it Mike; I’m never going to take you back.”

Mike flinched as the bond broke from her end. “But, Babe, I love you.”

“Shut it Mike, screw you and screw your w\*\*\*e Tiffany.”

Tiffany scoffed, “Just do it Mike, I’ve waited long enough for you. She’s had her turn and now it’s our turn for happiness.” She gushed at Mike in a sickeningly sweet voice. It was ridiculous seeing her covered in flour and halfway naked in the bakery.

Mike sighed dejectedly. “I, Micheal Swanson, accept the rejection.”

The bond snapped again, bringing Mike and me to our knees. I was quicker to recover and stood up. “Now get the f\*\*k out of my bakery. I’ll send a lawyer to Tiffany’s later this week. And Mike?”

“Yah, Babe?” He asked hopeful.

“Don’t you dare go to my house, it was my dad’s. You can get your s\*\*t on Saturday.”

With that, Tiffany and Mike dusted themselves off as best they could and rearranged their clothing. They left together out of the propped open back door.

I stood in silence for another second, then turned around. The staff were still standing and watching me.

“Time get back to work, the show’s over.” I felt like s\*\*t as I addressed my staff, well the two that I had left now. “Jim, Heather, can you give me a hand cleaning this up? And let’s add new sugar to the next list too. All of that can go in the dumpster.” I gestured to the seven stacked bags of sugar on their pallet.

“Yes, Chef.” They both complied.

I went to the wash station for the broom and mop. This was going to be a long ass week for me, and it was only Monday.

# Hogs and Haystacks

1914 WordsTeddy’s POV

I always enjoyed cruising the open roads. It gave me a sense of freedom that I could never achieve as an Alpha. As the leader of the Grave Hounds biker gang; the atmosphere was more relaxed. I could party as much as I wanted; and cause as much mayhem as I felt like. Screw rules I scoffed to myself as the wind buffered my face.

“Hey boss!” My second in command shouted from beside me. Normal people probably couldn’t hear a voice over the hum of so many Harley’s; but most of the gang were rogue werewolves who did not want to be tied down by a pack.

“Yah, Chip?”

“The next town over is Richmond, and Bertie’s bar is there. We should stop for the night for a good time.”

“Great idea, I’ll call the alpha of the area and let him know to expect us so there is no trouble.” I hated politics- but sometimes it was needed; especially to keep my gang safe. “You all ride ahead, I’ll pull off here to gas up.” I held up my hand with my middle finger and my thumb out, signaling to the gang to follow Chip. I pulled to the right and slowed down for the gas station. It was only half full; but at least I would be good to go all the way to the destination.

If I remember correctly, I mused, it’s Alpha Scott for this territory. I took out my simple flip phone and searched my contacts. Most of my gang laughed at the sight of my phone; but I did not care. The Nokia could last almost any wipeout I had on my bike- so the joke was on them for their delicate smartphones.

It has been four years since the last time the his gang had been through this territory, so hopefully Alpha Scott was still amicable with them stopping for a while. The line rang a few times before a deep voice answered. “Alpha Scott here.”

“Hey Scott; it’s Teddy Grave- leader of the Grave Hounds”

“Oh, Hey Tedd- what can I help you with man?”

I sighed and relaxed. I guess we left on decent terms last time, good. I thought to myself. “The gang and I will be cruising in; and want to stop and recoup in your territory for a bit if it’s alright.”

Alpha Scott did not answer right away, making me tense again. After a few seconds, Scott finally spoke. “Same rules apply as four years ago, man. No shifting in city limits, no causing public nuisances, and one week is all you got.”

“One week? It was a month last time we strolled in there.”

“Times are changing Tedd- the humans start to get suspicious of people with more strength than them. Plus there is a pack war going on right now. My people are antsy with outsiders at the moment. I can tell you the moment any of your gang steps out of line; you’ll have to move on for the sake and security of my pack.”

I cringed. This is why I hated packs. Always fighting over the stupid s\*\*t like land and hunting rights. But I could understand it for this city; lots of green spaces surrounded by farms with a few nature preserves and lots of woods- all with a decent city to boot too.

“I get the message man, I’ll pass it to my men as well.”

“See you at your bar then?”

“Sure; you’re more than welcome to party with the big league Scott.”

I hung up the phone and gassed up. Hopefully my gang followed orders this time around. Lately they had been burning bridges left and right with law breaking and stirring up trouble. Alpha Scott was one of the few places they could turn to now and, although they all enjoyed the open road and nomad lifestyle, it was nice to stop every now and then too to enjoy more modern amenities.

I mounted my Harley and kicked it into gear; Richmond, here we come, I thought to myself.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was a couple hours before the gang entered the city limits. We had to skip off the back roads to onto a major highway to get there. We could see the red barn of the local fireworks store; marking our exit.

Chip gave up the lead for me; making sure the higherarchy was prominent for all who saw us. A few miles into the small town; our favorite bar sat on the main street. Our gang of thirty-plus men pulled into the parking lot, trying to get all the bikes to fit without causing a crash. I directed my men around me signaling them all to wait a bit.

“I want you all to know that the same rules as last time apply for the area. All those who oppose and cause trouble get the same punishment as before.” Audible groans were heard all around. Our punishment system wasn’t harsh; just very demeaning for a wolf. Two weeks of wolf form and the doggy protective wear for bikers. Plus letting any human who asked to pet us do so. It was so humiliating that it worked for most of us in the gang for keeping everyone in line. “Also; our stint here is a week, trouble in the area.” There were a few grunts and groans at that. Most of the guys preferred the month stop over, they usually had to fix bikes and wanted to stock up on supplies.

With that; the gang dispersed to the bar. I stayed back to check on bikes and make sure everything was locked down before heading in. After about a half hour, I started to head to the door. The breeze picked up from the east and caressed my face, making me pause. That’s new I thought to myself. A bakery had opened up in the space next to the bar. Confections lined the window; tempting would be customers. My stomach gurgled at the thought of a sweet to eat.

Most werewolves shied away from sweet candies and confections; opting for more of a savory pallet. I was one of those rare few who enjoyed a good cookie or even a slice of cake. Deciding the bar could wait; I noticed that the sign on the door told that the bakery closed in ten minutes. Plenty of time to grab a snack I grinned to myself and headed on over. The smell was getting stronger as I pushed open the door to the bakery and a little bell chimed my arrival. Every confection available was lined up and organized. The displays made my mouth drool, and my stomach rumble louder.

“Be right with you!” A melodic voice called from the back of the store.

“Take your time; I’ll be a minute to decide.” I shouted back.

I scanned the cookie display, deciding that I was in the mood for something with chocolate. The last shelf in the case caught my eye. Chocolate Haystacks the sign read. I hadn’t had one of those since I was a pup. The simple chocolate and lo-main noodle mix had always been a favorite that my mom would make me. Being a Luna, she never really spent any time in the kitchen. But when I begged her for cookies, they were something she could whip up in a second.

I decided it was time to indulge in the memory and I would get the dozen or two that was there.

Still waiting for the voice from the back to appear, I tried to put my finger on what had smelled so divine when I was outside. It had a scent of vanilla to it; but it definitely wasn’t the cookies I smelled. The other cases had cakes and cupcakes, fancy dessert bites, and other confections; but none of them had the vanilla smell mixed with smokey caramel and rum.

“Sorry that took a minute sir, how might I help you?”

The voice made me jump. I had gotten lost in the smell and forgot where I was. Turning around, I saw the most breathtaking she-wolf I had ever seen. Her brown hair was tied up tightly in a bun; the color of pulled toffee. Her features were round and delicate in the face, giving her a classical renaissance maiden look. Her eyes the color of melted milk chocolate which the slightest hint of red. She was about five foot eight or so and curvy in all of the right places.

“All of the haystacks.” I managed to spit out after a second. My tongue seemed to be fighting me when it came to talking to her.

“Alright Sir; since we’re closed this weekend, they’ll be half off.” Her voice sounded musical to my ears as she packaged the cookies. Placing them on the counter and turning to the register, she typed in the code for them. ‘Is there anything else I can get for ya?” She inquired.

“Your number?” I tried to sound flirty for the girl. If I was going to stay here for a week, I definitely would make some time for some fun with this girl.

She smiled sadly to herself and blushed. “Thank, but no thanks. I have plans this week. The alpha already gave us pack members a heads up about you lot and I don’t really have the need or time for any trouble right now handsome. The total is eight fifty sir”

I bristled then shuffled my feet awkwardly. I wasn’t used to being shut down so quickly. I pulled out my wallet and gave her exact change. I scoffed to myself about Scott already warning his pack away. So much for hospitality I thought. “Can I get you to at least join me for a drink next door then?” Not one to give up easily, I hoped the goddess would change her mind.

“Again, I’m good. I need to finish closing up. Plus like I said, I have plans. Good evening.”

She gave me a shooing motion to the door, obviously trying to get me to go.

“Can I at least get a name to go with the beautiful face of yours?” I pleaded.

“Melody” she said simply, “now please scoot.”

I smiled to myself as I headed out the door. Melody, a name fit for the beautiful song she is I mused. As I exited the door, I heard a click behind me as the girl locked it quickly and flipped the sign from open to close.

I opened my box of cookies and stuffed a haystack in my mouth as I shuffled to the bar, pausing when the flavor hit my taste buds.

God dammit, I thought, they must have put crack or something in these to be this simple but addictive. I was definitely going to be making a stop again to this bakery come Monday. If not to see if everything tasted this great, but also to try and tempt Melody out for some fun.

# Court and Cupcakes part 1

I huffed out a breath and turned from the now locked door. Bikers; just great. More riffraff to deal with from next door. The location for my bakery wasn’t my first choice, but I could afford the down payment for it at the time. Sure, not a lot of people wanted to stop by for desserts because of the location, but I was hoping that once word got out the business would pick up.

After three years, I had a steady clientele, enough to keep in the black. I wanted to grow it more though. With the divorce now eminent for Monday; I thought that maybe after it, it might be easier to just focus on getting customers more than ever.

At least for pack law- if a mate was caught cheating, the other would receive seventy five percent of what the couple had grown together. The offended wolf would also receive any and all assets that they entered the marriage with. So I knew my house and bakery were safe. They all had my name on them and I had established the bakery the month before we officiated our mating ceremony.

I needed to let off steam after the events from earlier in the week, and a run sounded like just the thing to do before Monday reared its ugly head. Once the bakery was completely cleaned- and the donations packed up and put in their special lock box outside- I hopped into my yellow suv and headed to my favorite park.

The nice thing about the town I grew up in was its plethora of natural spaces. My favorite park was to the north and just bordering the city. There was a waterfall with a lot of hiking trails- and if you knew how to avoid those, a wolf could enjoy a decent run without running into any humans. I parked my suv next to the pond and headed to the hiking area.

I walked for twenty minutes before ducking off of the trail and heading to my favorite tree to undress. It was an old white river birch with a decent hole near the base. No animals dared to use it as a home; because many of the pack would mark it in animal form to scare off any unwanted pests. I stripped off my clothing and placed them back in the hole. No other clothes were in there, so it was nice to know that she had the park to herself tonight.

Relaxing and letting the change roll over me, I let my wolf come forward. My toffee-brown hair took over my body as I morphed into my wolf. I was a little over average size for a female with tips of gold here and there in my fur, my eyes the same shade of brown, but my paws slowly faded to a black from the rich color. My mother had always said that my wolf looked like it was wearing formal socks.

I took off running north, enjoying the woods and nature. It was exactly what I needed to do to relax before heading home. Tomorrow, Mike was coming to get his things, and a pack lawyer would be there to mediate and make sure things were civil. Monday almost felt like it was almost a silly dream that I had. I had given my staff the weekend off and made sure that there were no orders in for the weekend. Monday would be the official severance date; but I trusted my staff to run things smoothly then. Mondays were pretty slow with mostly just a breakfast and lunch rush that was manageable for a skeleton staff.

Without warning, the scene from this evening played in my head again, making my wolf perk up. The biker had been cute looking and keen on the eyes. His tall broad frame felt more inviting than intimidating. He was about six two and had a head of long curly jet black hair. His eyes were a honey brown compared to her chocolate ones. He had a cute goatee and a nice kept mustache as well. His skin had been a decent tan color, the type someone who spends most of their time outdoors would get.

His smell was very inviting as well, it was a rich tobacco scent with hints of rosemary and spice. It reminded me of a nice home cooked meal; one that I could savor for days.

Mate, my animal instincts were telling me. But I scoffed to myself. I was done with mates after the sorry excuse of a husband Mike was. Plus, mates would know right away if they were meant to be together. I had felt nothing but the ache of the bond break this week. Nothing was going to tempt me to go through that again, not even a sexy as hell biker.

After an hour and a half of running, I made my way back to the tree. I needed to head home and lock up a few things. I wouldn’t put it past Mike to try and claim some of my family valuables as his own.

The drive was uneventful back to the house. Going through things and organizing my clothing from Mike’s did not take long. After I was finished, I decided to make some cupcakes. It was about midnight and I had no desire to really sleep tonight. So I gathered all of the ingredients and set out to make some devils food cupcakes with caramel icing. After an hour, and a little extra for cleaning up, I sat down in my favorite chair in the kitchen to enjoy my snack. I made some for the lawyer as well for him to take home. The chocolate and caramel hit my tastebuds and made me feel less anxious than before.

I was never one to shy from my own cooking, and my curves showed it. I was still a healthy weight, just having extra here and there. My breasts were just over a double dee and my hips were slightly wider than my chest. My waist was a decent thirty inches. My hourglass shape had always given me a hard time finding clothing that fit and looked well on my five foot nine body- but I never really cared about that. Mike had always loved grabbing onto my hips and riding me doggy style when we first married, but that had quickly passed out of his system. Then it was just a vibrating dildo to keep me happy while he would doze off.

I sighed to myself as I looked at the clock. It was two thirty in the morning, and the lawyer with Mike was not due until eight. I decided that some sleep was better than nothing, just dealing with Mike I would need to be somewhat alert and ready. So I finished up my cupcake and headed to bed.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Hello beautiful, I hope I didn’t keep you waiting.” The tall biker from the bakery picked me up, setting me on the counter next to my cash register. My bakery had closed for the evening, the biker staying as I locked the door.

“You’re just in time.” I smiled at him and nipped at his jawline, making the wolf purr before me, he nuzzled my neck and suckled at my mate area; the skin sparking at his touch.

“All the same, I found you now; and now you are mine.” He stripped me of my clothes, the bakery fading around us into a more luxurious setting with draped silks and pillows around.

He took no time in caressing my body, trailing licks and bites across my skin in an intricate pattern.

“What are you doing? I’ve waited long enough for you, please fill me.” I begged, the waiting almost too much for me as I felt his member press against my inner thigh.

“Oh, my sweet little baker; I’m going to devour you like the delicacy you are.” He grinned wickedly at me, taking my knees as he leaned back and spreading them apart. Leaning down, he licked me like I was the most delectable dessert he had ever tasted.

\*\*\*\*\*

My alarm sounded shrill and loud right at seven. I rolled over and reached for my phone. My dreams had been fitful and erratic that night with the few hours of sleep I got. They were filled with the tall biker from yesterday. At one point it had gotten so bad with one dream, him holding me down and devouring my p\*\*\*y like it was fresh made crème brûlée, that I had to fish out my toy from the nightstand just to get myself to relax again.

Making sure that the toy was back in its’ drawer- I got up to get a shower and to get ready. Mike and the lawyer were due soon.

I had just finished breakfast when there was a knock on the front door. Bracing myself; I went to answer it.

“Sorry, Babe, I would have let myself in; but the locks were changed” Mikes five eleven frame filled the doorway. He was giving me his signature lopsided grin with his hazel eyes.

“I told you the other day on the phone, stop calling me Babe.” I had requested mediated phone calls that week as I had gotten the layer to set up today for Mike to get his things. “You can come into the living room until the lawyer gets here; but that’s it”

Mike huffed and shoved past me into the house. The living room was small, but cozy. One wall was covered in wooden bookshelves, and the other a fireplace with a television mounted above it. The third wall had a picture window that looked out at the street. Mike sat in the winged back chair and looked to me.

“How has your week gone, Mells?” Mike attempted small talk, sensing the tension in the air.

“Fine, except for the fact that my husband f\*\*\*\*d who I thought was my best friend.” I spit out husband like the word was poisoned.

Mike flinched at the bite in my voice. “Erm, uh, well I’m happy to hear that you did okey,”

After another few minutes of both of us sitting in a bitter silence, there was another knock at the door.

“Thank Goddess” I mumbled and got up. I didn’t want to talk to Mike more than I had to.

The lawyer was at the door with his assistant. “Hello Mrs. Swanson, I hope I didn’t keep you all waiting.”

“Not at all; please enter.” I stepped aside and ushered them into the living room. The lawyer sat at the couch and his assistant sat next to him. They began pulling out papers from briefcases and setting stacks of them on the coffee table.

“Before we begin; we have four hours today to go over belongings and buildings. It’s unusual to do these on a Saturday, but I understand that both parties want this finished quickly?” The lawyer adjusted his glasses.

“Yes, the sooner the better.” I replied.

“I guess.” Shrugged Mike.

“Alright; let’s start with the heavy things first. Buildings..”the lawyer squinted at the paper, “I have here listed 3021 W Street as the prime residence for both parties.”

“Yes, but the house was my father’s and is listed in my name.” I answered.

“Come on Mells- you’re not going to make me live out on the street are you?” Mike pouted.

“It’s in my name, Mike. If you had wanted to stay here, you should have thought of that before shagging Tiffany.”

“I have to agree with Mrs. Swanson on this, Mr. Swanson. At least on the first half.” The lawyer tried to say diplomatically. “The pack law clearly will state that all property acquired before the mating is legally hers.” The lawyer had the secretary make note on one of the papers and continued on. “The secondary residence is a condo on the beach in Florida, correct?”

“It was a wedding gift from my parents” Mike said.

“He can keep it, no contest there, I don’t want anything from his family.” I spoke up. At least this all should be simple and straightforward, I thought to myself as the secretary made note again.

“And finally, we have the bakery ‘Just Desserts’ listed as the third owned property.”

“Mine again before the marriage.” I stated quickly.

Mike coughed and looked down. Almost like he was guilty of something.

“Normally, yes, Mrs. Swanson.” The lawyer spoke up. “ but I have here a note for a substantial loan taken out last month in both of your names and the building space listed as collateral.”

The room became stuffy and silent when the lawyer spoke those words. “What..” I couldn’t believe my ears. “What loan?”

“I have here bank papers and statements showing the loan for one hundred thousand dollars and the bakery listed as collateral. As per law; since technically both of your names are listed on the loan, it will be split equally.”

I slowly turned to Mike. “What did you do?! You Bastard!” I was trying hard to control my shift. Fur was spreading up and down my arms in waves.

Mike was looking anywhere but at me staying silent; Trying to not squirm in his seat. “So it’s both ours, can we continue on now?” Mike tried to change the subject like the coward he was.

“No Mike, we are not continuing on!” I fumed. “What the actual f\*\*k?!”

“So I take it this will be contested then on Monday?” The lawyer stammered while trying to retain his cool. “It’s going to be hard to do, seeing as how your signature is on the loan as well Mrs. Swanson.”

“I never signed anything though!” I was flabbergasted.

“Here it is.” The Lawyer slid a paper over to the other side of the coffee table in front of me. There, in an almost perfect copy of my signature, was my name written neatly above Mike’s at the bottom of the loan agreement.

“This isn’t mine.” I stammers. “Someone forged it.”

“Stop lying, Mells, you were there with me.” Mike finally had the gall to speak up.

“The hell I was!”

“Please remain calm, both of you.” The lawyer spoke to both of us. “If you would like to contest this, please wait until Monday for the court and have evidence by the following Monday for finalization.”

I tried to rein in my shift; my wolf was struggling to come out and kill Mike as soon as possible. After a minute or two of calming breaths, the shifting slowly stopped and settled back to my normal alabaster skin. If Mike forged my signature, there was bound to be evidence somewhere. “Please; continue,” I finally sighed and the lawyer continued on to the cars and furniture.

Four grueling hours later, the lawyer and his secretary finally left my house; cupcakes safely tucked into their arms as they departed. Mike lingered in the first step. “I should get going.” He finally said.

“Yah; you should Mike.” I glared at him. “We both know that that wasn’t my signature though.”

“Babe, you signed it.” Mike smiled at me in an awful sickeningly sweet voice. “The bank will say the same thing. And as far as pack law goes, you’ll have to buy me out of my share. We both know you can’t though.”

I glared at him. “We’ll see.”

“Come a week from Monday, I doubt it.” Mike chuckled to himself and turned to walk down the porch.

As he made his way to his brand new truck, and then finally drove off, I let the tears flow freely. What the f\*\*k am I going to do? I cried as that thought bounced back and forth in my head. That was definitely not my signature on the papers and I had one week to prove it.

# Motors and Macarons

1713 WordsMelody’s POV

After everything I did for Mike, for him to pull this stunt really was the one thing that broke my heart. He knew how much the business meant to me, and to jeopardize it in such a fashion was really the last straw.

I spent the rest of the day going through the house and getting the rest of Mike’s things, which wasn’t much after his clothing. It was like he just moved in and left things as they were, not even making his own mark. The only place that really was almost all his was the basement, where his home gym set up was.

Movers came by at six that evening with a list from the lawyer what they would be taking and I directed them where to go. It took them two hours just to get the exercise machines from the basement. After all was said and done I was exhausted and worn out.

I went to the living room and sat down on a wingback chair, snacking on some macarons from Monday. Looking back on everything, I should have saw the signs of Mike’s infidelity sooner. Tiffany had always hung on to him when she was around, and I just wrote it off as them knowing each other before I had even met Mike. I would have never of guessed they were fated mates.

I sighed heavily, deciding that a few of the macarons were enough and that I needed some sleep after all of that drama, so I headed to bed early, intent of doing some at-home investigation tomorrow.

Sleep did not come easy to me, but in the end I did get some. I got up at her normal time of five thirty on Sunday morning, ready to tackle the day. I began by stripping the sheets on the bed and deep cleaning almost every room in the house. I wanted even the smallest scent of Mike gone for good.

I did some online research while I cleaned about what to do if someone took out a loan without your consent, and it all seemed pretty straight forward. I looked up the name of the bank online to see if they had a website, which luckily they did. I checked the hours that they were open and was disappointed to see that they were closed Sundays, but they did have an online link to create appointments with them.

After checking the schedule, there was only one space left for two thirty tomorrow. The bank closed at five, so I should have plenty of time to stop by after work. I needed to eventually put in a police report at the station as well. I didn’t know when and if I would have time to do that.

I went to the spare bedroom at the top of the stairs and opened the door. I couldn’t even remember the last time I went in there. A fine layer of dust coated everything, making me wince. This will take too long I sighed to myself. Just as I was about to step foot into the room I heard a noise from out front.

Crash, scree, wham!

It sounded like someone had wrecked a vehicle. I lived on the edge of the city limits, just outside of town so I was used to people speeding; but no one had ever crashed before.

I hurried down the steps and to the front door, sticking my head outside. There in the street were three people on motorcycles and the city mowers cleaning up their equipment. I grabbed my cellphone and hurried down my cement path to the street.

“Is everyone alright?” I called as I was halfway to the street. I paused as the wind shifted slightly, blowing the scent of the bikers to me. They were werewolf, and definitely not from my pack. I remembered that Alpha Scott had warned us about the bikers in a pack link, assuring everyone that they would be gone by Friday.

“f\*\*k, hell no!” The one who was in the accident shouted. “My bike!” The Viking looking biker was hunched on the road, lamenting over his wheels. Goddess, he should be more concerned about the state he is in I thought as I took in the scene. The wolf’s leg was bent in three places and the left side of his arm was almost scraped to the bone.

“We got this, go on we are fine!” Two were shouting at the mowing crew oblivious to me; they blocking the mowing teams’ path from going to the other biker, obviously trying to hide his fast healing rate. One of the men shooing them on looked to be almost forty and had brown hair and brown eyes.

I made my way to the Viking, intent on helping hide all of the blood from the humans. “Goddess, my baby…” the man lovingly picked up a broken mirror and looked at it in his hands.

“Can I get you anything to help?” I asked again, standing six feet away.

The wolf finally looked at me with his baby blue eyes, a slight mist to them. “Oh, thank Goddess you are a wolf! I don’t see you there.” The man’s stomach growled loudly then, almost sounding like a motorcycle itself. “I hate to ask, but do you have anything to eat? I skipped a nice meal this morning to race the jackass behind me.” He indicated the third man, spreading more blood about him; the arm now somewhat knit back together.

The third man finally turned around his red hair standing out like a traffic light. “I heard that, i\*\*\*t. It was your idea to begin with, seeing as how smooth and straight these roads are.” The mowing team had finally been persuaded to drive away, making the other two join them both.

“Here, let me go and get something then.” I turned to the house and ran inside. The sooner they were able to clean up all that blood, the less likely someone would try to stop and help. Reaching inside the house, I turned to the macarons I had left over from last night. I had about two dozen left of the assorted cookies; I always brought more home with me when I baked them at the bakery. “These should do, the sugar should make the healing kick in faster.” I handed them to the Viking, who took a handful and shoved them into his mouth.",1,1753339387.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Where is he? I thought to myself  as I walked around my SUV. He promised to be here and help. Mike, my husband, was nowhere to be seen. I sighed and shrugged. It was hard enough having to load the ten bags of flour by myself, but now I was going to have to bring them into the bakery as well. I would have tried the mate bond to contact him, but he had been ignoring me more than usual lately.   
  
Our bond was not really stable to begin with, not being fated mates and all. I had hoped though that Mike was truthful to me when he persued me those three years ago. Fresh out of culinary school and with some money saved to open my bakery, Mike had been one of my first customers- and my first lover. He claimed that even though we weren’t fated, he would persue me to the ends of the earth.  
  
Two months later; and I finally caved under the full moon during a rut for him. It was not my intention to lose my virginity that night, but something had made me feel wound up that evening during the pack run. Mike just happened to be nearby when I couldn’t take the itch anymore.  
  
Under the full moon, we had rutted our brains out for hours on a starlit patch of grass. It might have been my first time, but Mike had been gentle at first. His d\*\*k was a decent size too, I had thought at the time. And Mike had no issue performing, especially during the rut. But something had been missing.  
  
Now after three years, I was tired and always disappointed in Mike. It was like after we tied the knot- I was of no use to him anymore. It was almost like he had enjoyed the chase more than he enjoyed me. Our s\*x life was all but existent anymore. Up until two months ago, at least he would get the urge to bend me over and go to town on an all day session of love maybe twice a month if I was lucky. He always finished way before I could even orgasm- leaving me wanting and annoyed as he would pass out almost instantly.  
  
Now with a two month dry spell- and barely even a kiss on the cheek here or there, I was strung up on need and tired from working to cover his shift in the bakery as well.  
  
I went to the back door of the bakery and propped it open. Maybe I could get Tiffany to help me. Her best friend’s car was parked in its usual spot near the dumpster. It wasn’t her shift to work the counter today, but maybe she was just stopping in for a cookie or something.  
  
Picking up the first fourty pound bag of flour, I made my way into the back of the store and to the storage room.   
  
At first, I thought I heard some muffled voices from somewhere in the bakery, maybe it was a customer out front with the cashier. I made my way to the storage door and pushed it open.  
  
“Oh, God! Mike, Harder!” I stood still, shocked at the sight in front of me. On the pallet of sugar to the side, Mike and Tiffany were hard at work on each other. Mike’s ass bounced up and down as Tiffany’s legs were spread to either side of his hips, garishly up in the air like she was a paid porn star. The wet sounds of slapping filled the air as Mike grunted away inside her friend.  
  
“Mike?” I gasped shocked. The bag of flour I was carrying was forgotten as I dropped it from my grasp. It hit the floor with an audible thud as the bag split and flour permeated the air.  
  
Mike and Tiffany stopped immediately and tried to cover themselves. Mikes p\*\*\*s bobbed about, swaying back and forth as he scrambled to cover himself. Flour was starting to gather on every surface, including his p\*\*\*s. It dusted it like a fresh layer of snow, mixing with the wet after effects of s\*x.  
  
“Babe, it’s not what it looks like…” Mike stammered as he pulled up his pants.  
  
“Not what it looks like? Not what it looks like! Oh, so you’re not f\*\*\*\*\*g with my best friend over the sugar for the store?” I shouted at the top of my voice. “ No wonder you haven’t wanted to touch me, you fat pig! And you, Tiffany, what the f\*\*k?! You were supposed to be my best friend who I counted on, and here you are shagging my husband!”  
  
Tiffany scoffed, “ Best friend? yeah right. The only reason I have ever been around is for Mike. He would’ve been with me sooner, but he needed to get you out of his system first.  f\*\*k, I even snuck you an aphrodisiac those three years ago so you would finally give yourself up. Then he feels guilty because you were a virgin and of course he had to marry you to make it right. Now after three years, I’m finally taking my Mike back you cow. He has always been my fated mate!” Tiffany’s face was red from yelling, matching mine from anger.  
  
Staff from the kitchen and the front of the store had started to gather and watch the spectacle. The flour had finally settled down and the mess was everywhere.   
  
“You drugged me!?” I was in shock. It all made sense now. I had never had the need to take anyone before that night, and Mike had never really been her type. The only real reason we had even married was because of the taboo in wolf culture. Taking a virgin on a full moon was considered proposing and swearing an oath to mate after. No one really followed that now days, but most of the pack was more traditional than anything.  
  
I hung my head. Of course I was blind and naïve back then, fresh out of high school- straight to college- and never really making any friends.  
  
“Get the f\*\*k out.” I whispered dejectedly.  Mike began to stammer. “No, no excuses. I Melody Swanson, reject you Micheal Swanson, as my mate and spouse.” The sting hurt; but I knew it was worth it. “Accept it Mike; I’m never going to take you back.”  
  
Mike flinched as the bond broke from her end. “But, Babe, I love you.”  
  
“Shut it Mike, screw you and screw your w\*\*\*e Tiffany.”  
  
Tiffany scoffed, “Just do it Mike, I’ve waited long enough for you. She’s had her turn and now it’s our turn for happiness.” She gushed at Mike in a sickeningly sweet voice. It was ridiculous seeing her covered in flour and halfway naked in the bakery.  
  
Mike sighed dejectedly. “I, Micheal Swanson, accept the rejection.”  
  
The bond snapped again, bringing Mike and me to our knees. I was quicker to recover and stood up. “Now get the f\*\*k out of my bakery. I’ll send a lawyer to Tiffany’s later this week. And Mike?”  
  
“Yah, Babe?” He asked hopeful.  
  
“Don’t you dare go to my house, it was my dad’s. You can get your s\*\*t on Saturday.”  
  
With that, Tiffany and Mike dusted themselves off as best they could and rearranged their clothing. They left together out of the propped open back door.  
  
I stood in silence for another second, then turned around. The staff were still standing and watching me.  
  
“Time get back to work, the show’s over.” I felt like s\*\*t as I addressed my staff, well the two that I had left now. “Jim, Heather, can you give me a hand cleaning this up? And let’s add new sugar to the next list too. All of that can go in the dumpster.” I gestured to the seven stacked bags of sugar on their pallet.  
  
“Yes, Chef.” They both complied.  
  
I went to the wash station for the broom and mop. This was going to be a long ass week for me, and it was only Monday.  
  


# Hogs and Haystacks

1914 WordsTeddy’s POV  
  
I always enjoyed cruising the open roads. It gave me a sense of freedom that I could never achieve as an Alpha. As the leader of the Grave Hounds biker gang; the atmosphere was more relaxed. I could party as much as I wanted; and cause as much mayhem as I felt like. Screw rules I scoffed to myself as the wind buffered my face.  
  
“Hey boss!” My second in command shouted from beside me. Normal people probably couldn’t hear a voice over the hum of so many Harley’s; but most of the gang were rogue werewolves who did not want to be tied down by a pack.   
  
“Yah, Chip?”  
  
“The next town over is Richmond, and Bertie’s bar is there. We should stop for the night for a good time.”  
  
“Great idea, I’ll call the alpha of the area and let him know to expect us so there is no trouble.” I hated politics- but sometimes it was needed; especially to keep my gang safe. “You all ride ahead, I’ll pull off here to gas up.” I held up my hand with my middle finger and my thumb out, signaling to the gang to follow Chip. I pulled to the right and slowed down for the gas station. It was only half full; but at least I would be good to go all the way to the destination.  
  
If I remember correctly, I mused, it’s Alpha Scott for this territory. I took out my simple flip phone and searched my contacts. Most of my gang laughed at the sight of my phone; but I did not care. The Nokia could last almost any wipeout I had on my bike- so the joke was on them for their delicate smartphones.  
  
It has been four years since the last time the his gang had been through this territory, so hopefully Alpha Scott was still amicable with them stopping for a while. The line rang a few times before a deep voice answered. “Alpha Scott here.”  
  
“Hey Scott; it’s Teddy Grave- leader of the Grave Hounds”  
  
“Oh, Hey Tedd- what can I help you with man?”  
  
I sighed and relaxed. I guess we left on decent terms last time, good. I thought to myself. “The gang and I will be cruising in; and want to stop and recoup in your territory for a bit if it’s alright.”  
  
Alpha Scott did not answer right away, making me tense again. After a few seconds, Scott finally spoke. “Same rules apply as four years ago, man. No shifting in city limits, no causing public nuisances, and one week is all you got.”  
  
“One week? It was a month last time we strolled in there.”  
  
“Times are changing Tedd- the humans start to get suspicious of people with more strength than them. Plus there is a pack war going on right now. My people are antsy with outsiders at the moment. I can tell you the moment any of your gang steps out of line; you’ll have to move on for the sake and security of my pack.”  
  
I cringed. This is why I hated packs. Always fighting over the stupid s\*\*t like land and hunting rights. But I could understand it for this city; lots of green spaces surrounded by farms with a few nature preserves and lots of woods- all with a decent city to boot too.  
  
“I get the message man, I’ll pass it to my men as well.”  
  
“See you at your bar then?”  
  
“Sure; you’re more than welcome to party with the big league Scott.”  
  
I hung up the phone and gassed up. Hopefully my gang followed orders this time around. Lately they had been burning bridges left and right with law breaking and stirring up trouble. Alpha Scott was one of the few places they could turn to now and, although they all enjoyed the open road and nomad lifestyle, it was nice to stop every now and then too to enjoy more modern amenities.  
  
I mounted my Harley and kicked it into gear; Richmond, here we come, I thought to myself.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
It was a couple hours before the gang entered the city limits. We had to skip off the back roads to onto a major highway to get there. We could see the red barn of the local fireworks store; marking our exit.  
  
Chip gave up the lead for me; making sure the higherarchy was prominent for all who saw us. A few miles into the small town; our favorite bar sat on the main street. Our gang of thirty-plus men pulled into the parking lot, trying to get all the bikes to fit without causing a crash. I directed my men around me signaling them all to wait a bit.  
  
“I want you all to know that the same rules as last time apply for the area. All those who oppose and cause trouble get the same punishment as before.” Audible groans were heard all around. Our punishment system wasn’t harsh; just very demeaning for a wolf. Two weeks of wolf form and the doggy protective wear for bikers. Plus letting any human who asked to pet us do so. It was so humiliating that it worked for most of us in the gang for keeping everyone in line. “Also; our stint here is a week, trouble in the area.” There were a few grunts and groans at that. Most of the guys preferred the month stop over, they usually had to fix bikes and wanted to stock up on supplies.  
  
With that; the gang dispersed to the bar. I stayed back to check on bikes and make sure everything was locked down before heading in. After about a half hour, I started to head to the door. The breeze picked up from the east and caressed my face, making me pause. That’s new I thought to myself. A bakery had opened up in the space next to the bar. Confections lined the window; tempting would be customers. My stomach gurgled at the thought of a sweet to eat.  
  
Most werewolves shied away from sweet candies and confections; opting for more of a savory pallet. I was one of those rare few who enjoyed a good cookie or even a slice of cake. Deciding the bar could wait; I noticed that the sign on the door told that the bakery closed in ten minutes. Plenty of time to grab a snack I grinned to myself and headed on over. The smell was getting stronger as I pushed open the door to the bakery and a little bell chimed my arrival. Every confection available was lined up and organized. The displays made my mouth drool, and my stomach rumble louder.  
  
“Be right with you!” A melodic voice called from the back of the store.  
  
“Take your time; I’ll be a minute to decide.” I shouted back.  
  
I scanned the cookie display, deciding that I was in the mood for something with chocolate. The last shelf in the case caught my eye. Chocolate Haystacks the sign read. I hadn’t had one of those since I was a pup. The simple chocolate and lo-main noodle mix had always been a favorite that my mom would make me. Being a Luna, she never really spent any time in the kitchen. But when I begged her for cookies, they were something she could whip up in a second.  
  
I decided it was time to indulge in the memory and I would get the dozen or two that was there.   
  
Still waiting for the voice from the back to appear, I tried to put my finger on what had smelled so divine when I was outside. It had a scent of vanilla to it; but it definitely wasn’t the cookies I smelled. The other cases had cakes and cupcakes, fancy dessert bites, and other confections; but none of them had the vanilla smell mixed with smokey caramel and rum.  
  
“Sorry that took a minute sir, how might I help you?”  
  
The voice made me jump. I had gotten lost in the smell and forgot where I was. Turning around, I saw the most breathtaking she-wolf I had ever seen. Her brown hair was tied up tightly in a bun; the color of pulled toffee. Her features were round and delicate in the face, giving her a classical renaissance maiden look. Her eyes the color of melted milk chocolate which the slightest hint of red. She was about five foot eight or so and curvy in all of the right places.  
  
“All of the haystacks.” I managed to spit out after a second. My tongue seemed to be fighting me when it came to talking to her.  
  
“Alright Sir; since we’re closed this weekend, they’ll be half off.” Her voice sounded musical to my ears as she packaged the cookies. Placing them on the counter and turning to the register, she typed in the code for them. ‘Is there anything else I can get for ya?” She inquired.  
  
“Your number?” I tried to sound flirty for the girl. If I was going to stay here for a week, I definitely would make some time for some fun with this girl.  
  
She smiled sadly to herself and blushed. “Thank, but no thanks. I have plans this week. The alpha already gave us pack members a heads up about you lot and I don’t really have the need or time for any trouble right now handsome. The total is eight fifty sir”  
  
I bristled then shuffled my feet awkwardly. I wasn’t used to being shut down so quickly. I pulled out my wallet and gave her exact change. I scoffed to myself about Scott already warning his pack away. So much for hospitality I thought. “Can I get you to at least join me for a drink next door then?” Not one to give up easily, I hoped the goddess would change her mind.  
  
“Again, I’m good. I need to finish closing up. Plus like I said, I have plans. Good evening.”  
  
She gave me a shooing motion to the door, obviously trying to get me to go.  
  
“Can I at least get a name to go with the beautiful face of yours?” I pleaded.  
  
“Melody” she said simply, “now please scoot.”  
  
I smiled to myself as I headed out the door. Melody, a name fit for the beautiful song she is I mused. As I exited the door, I heard a click behind me as the girl locked it quickly and flipped the sign from open to close.  
  
I opened my box of cookies and stuffed a haystack in my mouth as I shuffled to the bar, pausing when the flavor hit my taste buds.  
  
God dammit, I thought, they must have put crack or something in these to be this simple but addictive. I was definitely going to be making a stop again to this bakery come Monday. If not to see if everything tasted this great, but also to try and tempt Melody out for some fun.  
  


# Court and Cupcakes part 1

1549 WordsMelody’s POV  
  
I huffed out a breath and turned from the now locked door. Bikers; just great. More riffraff to deal with from next door. The location for my bakery wasn’t my first choice, but I could afford the down payment for it at the time.  Sure, not a lot of people wanted to stop by for desserts because of the location, but I was hoping that once word got out the business would pick up.  
  
After three years, I had a steady clientele, enough to keep in the black. I wanted to grow it more though. With the divorce now eminent for Monday; I thought that maybe after it, it might be easier to just focus on getting customers more than ever.  
  
At least for pack law- if a mate was caught cheating, the other would receive seventy five percent of what the couple had grown together. The offended wolf would also receive any and all assets that they entered the marriage with. So I knew my house and bakery were safe. They all had my name on them and I had established the bakery the month before we officiated our mating ceremony.   
  
I needed to let off steam after the events from earlier in the week, and a run sounded like just the thing to do before Monday reared its ugly head. Once the bakery was completely cleaned- and the donations packed up and put in their special lock box outside- I hopped into my yellow suv and headed to my favorite park.  
  
The nice thing about the town I grew up in was its plethora of natural spaces. My favorite park was to the north and just bordering the city. There was a waterfall with a lot of hiking trails- and if you knew how to avoid those, a wolf could enjoy a decent run without running into any humans. I parked my suv next to the pond and headed to the hiking area.   
  
I walked for twenty minutes before ducking off of the trail and heading to my favorite tree to undress. It was an old white river birch with a decent hole near the base. No animals dared to use it as a home; because many of the pack would mark it in animal form to scare off any unwanted pests. I stripped off my clothing and placed them back in the hole. No other clothes were in there, so it was nice to know that she had the park to herself tonight.  
  
Relaxing and letting the change roll over me, I let my wolf come forward. My toffee-brown hair took over my body as I morphed into my wolf. I was a little over average size for a female with tips of gold here and there in my fur, my eyes the same shade of brown, but my paws slowly faded to a black from the rich color. My mother had always said that my wolf looked like it was wearing formal socks.  
  
I took off running north, enjoying the woods and nature. It was exactly what I needed to do to relax before heading home. Tomorrow, Mike was coming to get his things, and a pack lawyer would be there to mediate and make sure things were civil. Monday almost felt like it was almost a silly dream that I had. I had given my staff the weekend off and made sure that there were no orders in for the weekend. Monday would be the official severance date; but I trusted my staff to run things smoothly then. Mondays were pretty slow with mostly just a breakfast and lunch rush that was manageable for a skeleton staff.  
  
Without warning, the scene from this evening played in my head again, making my wolf perk up. The biker had been cute looking and keen on the eyes. His tall broad frame felt more inviting than intimidating. He was about six two and had a head of long curly jet black hair. His eyes were a honey brown compared to her chocolate ones. He had a cute goatee and a nice kept mustache as well. His skin had been a decent tan color, the type someone who spends most of their time outdoors would get.  
  
His smell was very inviting as well, it was a rich tobacco scent with hints of rosemary and spice. It reminded me of a nice home cooked meal; one that I could savor for days.  
  
Mate, my animal instincts were telling me. But I scoffed to myself. I was done with mates after the sorry excuse of a husband Mike was. Plus, mates would know right away if they were meant to be together. I had felt nothing but the ache of the bond break this week. Nothing was going to tempt me to go through that again, not even a sexy as hell biker.  
  
After an hour and a half of running, I  made my way back to the tree. I needed to head home and lock up a few things. I wouldn’t put it past Mike to try and claim some of my family valuables as his own.  
  
The drive was uneventful back to the house. Going through things and organizing my clothing from Mike’s did not take long. After I was finished, I decided to make some cupcakes. It was about midnight and I had no desire to really sleep tonight. So I gathered all of the ingredients and set out to make some devils food cupcakes with caramel icing. After an hour, and a little extra for cleaning up, I sat down in my favorite chair in the kitchen to enjoy my snack. I made some for the lawyer as well for him to take home. The chocolate and caramel hit my tastebuds and made me feel less anxious than before.  
  
I was never one to shy from my own cooking, and my curves showed it. I was still a healthy weight, just having extra here and there. My breasts were just over a double dee and my hips were slightly wider than my chest. My waist was a decent thirty inches. My hourglass shape had always given me a hard time finding clothing that fit and looked well on my five foot nine body- but I never really cared about that. Mike had always loved grabbing onto my hips and riding me doggy style when we first married, but that had quickly passed out of his system. Then it was just a vibrating dildo to keep me happy while he would doze off.  
  
I sighed to myself as I looked at the clock. It was two thirty in the morning, and the lawyer with Mike was not due until eight. I decided that some sleep was better than nothing, just dealing with Mike I would need to be somewhat alert and ready. So I finished up my cupcake and headed to bed.   
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
“Hello beautiful, I hope I didn’t keep you waiting.” The tall biker from the bakery picked me up, setting me on the counter next to my cash register. My bakery had closed for the evening, the biker staying as I locked the door.  
  
“You’re just in time.” I smiled at him and nipped at his jawline, making the wolf purr before me, he nuzzled my neck and suckled at my mate area; the skin sparking at his touch.  
  
“All the same, I found you now; and now you are mine.” He stripped me of my clothes, the bakery fading around us into a more luxurious setting with draped silks and pillows around.  
  
He took no time in caressing my body, trailing licks and bites across my skin in an intricate pattern.   
  
“What are you doing? I’ve waited long enough for you, please fill me.” I begged, the waiting almost too much for me as I felt his member press against my inner thigh.  
  
“Oh, my sweet little baker; I’m going to devour you like the delicacy you are.” He grinned wickedly at me, taking my knees as he leaned back and spreading them apart. Leaning down, he licked me like I was the most delectable dessert he had ever tasted.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
My alarm sounded shrill and loud right at seven. I rolled over and reached for my phone. My dreams had been fitful and erratic that night with the few hours of sleep I got. They were filled with the tall biker from yesterday. At one point it had gotten so bad with one dream, him holding me down and devouring my p\*\*\*y like it was fresh made crème brûlée, that I had to fish out my toy from the nightstand just to get myself to relax again.  
  
Making sure that the toy was back in its’ drawer- I got up to get a shower and to get ready. Mike and the lawyer were due soon.  
  
I had just finished breakfast when there was a knock on the front door. Bracing myself; I went to answer it.  
  
“Sorry, Babe, I would have let myself in; but the locks were changed” Mikes five eleven frame filled the doorway. He was giving me his signature lopsided grin with his hazel eyes.  
  


# Court and Cupcakes part 2

1227 WordsMelody’s POV  
  
“I told you the other day on the phone, stop calling me Babe.” I had requested mediated phone calls that week as I had gotten the layer to set up today for Mike to get his things. “You can come into the living room until the lawyer gets here; but that’s it”  
  
Mike huffed and shoved past me into the house. The living room was small, but cozy. One wall was covered in wooden bookshelves, and the other a fireplace with a television mounted above it. The third wall had a picture window that looked out at the street. Mike sat in the winged back chair and looked to me.  
  
“How has your week gone, Mells?” Mike attempted small talk, sensing the tension in the air.  
  
“Fine, except for the fact that my husband f\*\*\*\*d who I thought was my best friend.” I spit out husband like the word was poisoned.  
  
Mike flinched at the bite in my voice. “Erm, uh, well I’m happy to hear that you did okey,”  
  
After another few minutes of both of us sitting in a bitter silence, there was another knock at the door.  
  
“Thank Goddess” I mumbled and got up. I didn’t want to talk to Mike more than I had to.  
  
The lawyer was at the door with his assistant. “Hello Mrs. Swanson, I hope I didn’t keep you all waiting.”  
  
“Not at all; please enter.” I stepped aside and ushered them into the living room. The lawyer sat at the couch and his assistant sat next to him. They began pulling out papers from briefcases and setting stacks of them on the coffee table.  
  
“Before we begin; we have four hours today to go over belongings and buildings. It’s unusual to do these on a Saturday, but I understand that both parties want this finished quickly?” The lawyer adjusted his glasses.  
  
“Yes, the sooner the better.” I replied.  
  
“I guess.” Shrugged Mike.  
  
“Alright; let’s start with the heavy things first. Buildings..”the lawyer squinted at the paper, “I have here listed 3021 W Street as the prime residence for both parties.”  
  
“Yes, but the house was my father’s and is listed in my name.” I answered.  
  
“Come on Mells- you’re not going to make me live out on the street are you?” Mike pouted.  
  
“It’s in my name, Mike. If you had wanted to stay here, you should have thought of that before shagging Tiffany.”  
  
“I have to agree with Mrs. Swanson on this, Mr. Swanson. At least on the first half.” The lawyer tried to say diplomatically. “The pack law clearly will state that all property acquired before the mating is legally hers.” The lawyer had the secretary make note on one of the papers and continued on. “The secondary residence is a condo on the beach in Florida, correct?”  
  
“It was a wedding gift from my parents” Mike said.   
  
“He can keep it, no contest there, I don’t want anything from his family.” I spoke up. At least this all should be simple and straightforward, I thought to myself as the secretary made note again.  
  
“And finally, we have the bakery ‘Just Desserts’ listed as the third owned property.”   
  
“Mine again before the marriage.” I stated quickly.  
  
Mike coughed and looked down. Almost like he was guilty of something.  
  
“Normally, yes, Mrs. Swanson.” The lawyer spoke up. “ but I have here a note for a substantial loan taken out last month in both of your names and the building space listed as collateral.”  
  
The room became stuffy and silent when the lawyer spoke those words. “What..” I couldn’t believe my ears. “What loan?”  
  
“I have here bank papers and statements showing the loan for one hundred thousand dollars and the bakery listed as collateral. As per law; since technically both of your names are listed on the loan, it will be split equally.”  
  
I slowly turned to Mike. “What did you do?! You Bastard!” I was trying hard to control my shift. Fur was spreading up and down my arms in waves.  
  
Mike was looking anywhere but at me staying silent; Trying to not squirm in his seat. “So it’s both ours, can we continue on now?” Mike tried to change the subject like the coward he was.  
  
“No Mike, we are not continuing on!” I fumed. “What the actual f\*\*k?!”  
  
“So I take it this will be contested then on Monday?” The lawyer stammered while trying to retain his cool. “It’s going to be hard to do, seeing as how your signature is on the loan as well Mrs. Swanson.”  
  
“I never signed anything though!” I was flabbergasted.  
  
“Here it is.” The Lawyer slid a paper over to the other side of the coffee table in front of me. There, in an almost perfect copy of my signature, was my name written neatly above Mike’s at the bottom of the loan agreement.  
  
“This isn’t mine.” I stammers. “Someone forged it.”  
  
“Stop lying, Mells, you were there with me.” Mike finally had the gall to speak up.  
  
“The hell I was!”  
  
“Please remain calm, both of you.” The lawyer spoke to both of us. “If you would like to contest this, please wait until Monday for the court and have evidence by the following Monday for finalization.”  
  
I tried to rein in my shift; my wolf was struggling to come out and kill Mike as soon as possible. After a minute or two of calming breaths, the shifting slowly stopped and settled back to my normal alabaster skin. If Mike forged my signature, there was bound to be evidence somewhere. “Please; continue,” I finally sighed and the lawyer continued on to the cars and furniture.  
  
Four grueling hours later, the lawyer and his secretary finally left my house; cupcakes safely tucked into their arms as they departed. Mike lingered in the first step. “I should get going.” He finally said.  
  
“Yah; you should Mike.” I glared at him. “We both know that that wasn’t my signature though.”  
  
“Babe, you signed it.” Mike smiled at me in an awful sickeningly sweet voice. “The bank will say the same thing. And as far as pack law goes, you’ll have to buy me out of my share. We both know you can’t though.”  
  
I glared at him. “We’ll see.”  
  
“Come a week from Monday, I doubt it.” Mike chuckled to himself and turned to walk down the porch.  
  
As he made his way to his brand new truck, and then finally drove off, I let the tears flow freely. What the f\*\*k am I going to do?  I cried as that thought bounced back and forth in my head. That was definitely not my signature on the papers and I had one week to prove it.  
  


# Motors and Macarons

1713 WordsMelody’s POV  
  
After everything I did for Mike, for him to pull this stunt really was the one thing that broke my heart. He knew how much the business meant to me, and to jeopardize it in such a fashion was really the last straw.  
  
I spent the rest of the day going through the house and getting the rest of Mike’s things, which wasn’t much after his clothing. It was like he just moved in and left things as they were, not even making his own mark. The only place that really was almost all his was the basement, where his home gym set up was.  
  
Movers came by at six that evening with a list from the lawyer what they would be taking and I directed them where to go. It took them two hours just to get the exercise machines from the basement. After all was said and done I was exhausted and worn out.  
  
I went to the living room and sat down on a wingback chair, snacking on some macarons from Monday. Looking back on everything, I should have saw the signs of Mike’s infidelity sooner. Tiffany had always hung on to him when she was around, and I just wrote it off as them knowing each other before I had even met Mike. I would have never of guessed they were fated mates.  
  
I sighed heavily, deciding that a few of the macarons were enough and that I needed some sleep after all of that drama, so I headed to bed early, intent of doing some at-home investigation tomorrow.  
  
Sleep did not come easy to me, but in the end I did get some. I got up at her normal time of five thirty on Sunday morning, ready to tackle the day. I began by stripping the sheets on the bed and deep cleaning almost every room in the house. I wanted even the smallest scent of Mike gone for good.  
  
I did some online research while I cleaned about what to do if someone took out a loan without your consent, and it all seemed pretty straight forward. I looked up the name of the bank online to see if they had a website, which  luckily they did. I checked the hours that they were open and was disappointed to see that they were closed Sundays, but they did have an online link to create appointments with them.  
  
After checking the schedule, there was only one space left for two thirty tomorrow. The bank closed at five, so I should have plenty of time to stop by after work. I needed to eventually put in a police report at the station as well. I didn’t know when and if I would have time to do that.  
  
I went to the spare bedroom at the top of the stairs and opened the door. I couldn’t even remember the last time I went in there. A fine layer of dust coated everything, making me wince. This will take too long I sighed to myself. Just as I was about to step foot into the room I heard a noise from out front.  
  
Crash, scree, wham!  
  
It sounded like someone had wrecked a vehicle. I lived on the edge of the city limits, just outside of town so I was used to people speeding; but no one had ever crashed before.  
  
I hurried down the steps and to the front door, sticking my head outside. There in the street were three people on motorcycles and the city mowers cleaning up their equipment. I grabbed my cellphone and hurried down my cement path to the street.  
  
“Is everyone alright?” I called as I was halfway to the street. I paused as the wind shifted slightly, blowing the scent of the bikers to me. They were werewolf, and definitely not from my pack. I remembered that Alpha Scott had warned us about the bikers in a pack link, assuring everyone that they would be gone by Friday.  
  
“f\*\*k, hell no!” The one who was in the accident shouted. “My bike!” The Viking looking biker was hunched on the road, lamenting over his wheels. Goddess, he should be more concerned about the state he is in I thought as I took in the scene. The wolf’s leg was bent in three places and the left side of his arm was almost scraped to the bone.  
  
“We got this, go on we are fine!” Two were shouting at the mowing crew oblivious to me; they blocking the mowing teams’ path from going to the other biker, obviously trying to hide his fast healing rate. One of the men shooing them on looked to be almost forty and had brown hair and brown eyes.  
  
I made my way to the Viking, intent on helping hide all of the blood from the humans. “Goddess, my baby…” the man lovingly picked up a broken mirror and looked at it in his hands.  
  
“Can I get you anything to help?” I asked again, standing six feet away.  
  
The wolf finally looked at me with his baby blue eyes, a slight mist to them. “Oh, thank Goddess you are a wolf! I don’t see you there.” The man’s stomach growled loudly then, almost sounding like a motorcycle itself. “I hate to ask, but do you have anything to eat? I skipped a nice meal this morning to race the jackass behind me.” He indicated the third man, spreading more blood about him; the arm now somewhat knit back together.  
  
The third man finally turned around his red hair standing out like a traffic light. “I heard that, i\*\*\*t. It was your idea to begin with, seeing as how smooth and straight these roads are.” The mowing team had finally been persuaded to drive away, making the other two join them both.  
  
“Here, let me go and get something then.” I turned to the house and ran inside. The sooner they were able to clean up all that blood, the less likely someone would try to stop and help. Reaching inside the house, I turned to the macarons I had left over from last night. I had about two dozen left of the assorted cookies; I always brought more home with me when I baked them at the bakery. “These should do, the sugar should make the healing kick in faster.” I handed them to the Viking, who took a handful and shoved them into his mouth.

Here's why.

This full-day adventure takes you around the entire island, hitting all the major spots you've probably seen on Instagram and in movies. But it's so much more than just photo ops.

The tour starts early morning in Waikiki, which I actually prefer because you beat the crowds and the heat. Your first stop at Diamond Head gives you those postcard-perfect views of Honolulu's coastline. Trust me, the morning light makes for incredible photos.

What really sets this tour apart is that you get to experience both the tourist hotspots and local secrets. The Halona Blowhole is impressive, but wait until you try fresh garlic shrimp from the North Shore food trucks - that's where the real Hawaii magic happens.

My favorite part? Waimea Valley. While most tourists just drive by, this tour actually takes you into the botanical gardens and up to the waterfall. You can even swim there if you want (bring your swimsuit!). The water is refreshingly cool, and the whole experience feels sacred, especially when you learn about the valley's cultural significance from your guide.

Speaking of guides, they're all locals who really know their stuff. They'll tell you stories about ancient Hawaii while driving past the Kualoa Ranch (yes, where they filmed Jurassic Park), and they know exactly where to stop for the best photo opportunities.

The tour includes coffee and macadamia nut tastings at Tropical Farms, which is way better than buying overpriced souvenirs at the airport. And yes, you'll get to try the famous Dole Whip at the Dole Plantation.

I've done this tour multiple times with visiting friends, and it never disappoints. At $154 per person, it's actually great value considering you get a full day of activities, admission fees, and transportation included. Plus, you don't have to worry about navigating Hawaiian roads or missing any important sites.

If you're interested in booking this tour (which I highly recommend doing early in your trip), you can check availability here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

One tip: bring cash for lunch and some extra snacks. While the tour hits all the major spots, you'll want to try some local treats along the way.

Remember, Oahu isn't just about beaches and resorts. This tour shows you the real Hawaii - from the bustling south shore to the laid-back North Shore vibes, from ancient cultural sites to modern filming locations. It's the perfect introduction to the island, and honestly, the best way to see everything in one day.

Just make sure to book in advance, especially during peak season. The small group size (maximum 24 people) means spots fill up quickly. And don't forget your camera - you'll want to remember this one.",2,1753338704.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False
1m7wzy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Inside-Albatross8405/comments/1m7wzy4/how_to_use_behavioral_marketing_and_customer/,How to Use Behavioral Marketing and Customer Journey Insights to Boost Shopify Sales,"In today’s saturated ecommerce landscape, Shopify merchants need more than great products—they need personalized, data-driven marketing strategies that align with real customer behavior. This is where Shopify behavioral marketing, customer journey dashboards, and automated cross-sell emails can become game-changers.

By combining behavioral insights with split testing on product pages and intelligent email workflows, you can significantly increase engagement, conversions, and lifetime value.

Let’s break down how to turn data into revenue using a smart behavioral marketing approach on Shopify.

[Shopify behavioral marketing ](https://preview.redd.it/nwgrv9fvnref1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea898d5947e7bc9c30d8e409f45d945f6c23cfe6)

# What Is Behavioral Marketing in Shopify?

**Shopify behavioral marketing** is a strategy that tailors product recommendations, messages, and offers based on how a customer behaves on your site.

This includes:

* What pages they visit  
* What products they view or add to cart  
* Time spent on page  
* Purchase history  
* Email interactions  

Instead of a one-size-fits-all campaign, behavioral marketing responds in real time to what users actually do—leading to higher relevance and conversion rates.

# Examples of Behavioral Marketing in Action

1. Exit-Intent Popups: Show a special discount when someone hovers toward the exit.  
2. Cart Abandonment Emails: Trigger emails only if someone added items but didn’t check out.  
3. Browse Abandonment Emails: Follow up when a visitor views products but doesn’t add to cart.  
4. On-Site Product Recommendations: Suggest items based on past behavior or similar customer paths.  

# Track It All with a Shopify Customer Journey Dashboard

To power any behavioral marketing strategy, you first need data visibility. That’s where a **Shopify customer journey dashboard** comes in.

These dashboards give you a complete picture of how shoppers move through your site—where they drop off, convert, or get stuck—so you can optimize every step of their journey.

# What a Good Customer Journey Dashboard Should Show:

* Visitor paths (landing → product → cart → checkout)  
* Conversion funnel analytics  
* Product page engagement  
* Cart abandonment points  
* Repeat vs. first-time customer behavior  
* Revenue attribution by channel or journey stage  

When connected to your Shopify store, these tools help you answer questions like:

* Which product pages lead to the most conversions?  
* At what point do users most commonly drop off?  
* What behaviors are common before high-ticket purchases?  

# Why You Need to Split Test Shopify Product Pages

Once you’re tracking behavior, the next step is optimization. That means split testing.

**Split testing product pages on Shopify** (also known as A/B testing) allows you to test different versions of your page elements—such as headlines, images, pricing formats, or call-to-actions—to see what drives more sales.

# What to Split Test on Shopify Product Pages:

* Product titles vs. benefit-led headlines  
* Static vs. lifestyle product images  
* Different price points or discounts  
* Short vs. long product descriptions  
* ""Add to Cart"" button colors or positions  
* Reviews placement (above vs. below the fold)  

With testing, even small changes can lead to large lifts in conversion rate and AOV.

# Tools for Split Testing on Shopify

1. Google Optimize (sunsetting soon) → Use VWO or Convert instead  
2. Shopify Apps like Neat A/B Testing or Intelligems  
   * Split test pricing, copy, and more  
   * Easy integration with Shopify stores  
3. Shogun or Replo (for visual testing)  
   * Design and test landing pages and product pages  
   * No-code A/B testing options  

Remember, always test one variable at a time and let tests run for a full buying cycle to get accurate results.

# Close the Loop with Shopify Email Cross-Sell Automation

Once someone buys, your job isn’t done. In fact, it’s just beginning. The post-purchase window is one of the best opportunities to drive more revenue.

Using **Shopify email cross-sell automation**, you can automatically recommend relevant products via email after a purchase is made.

These emails are:

* Triggered (based on behavior)  
* Personalized (based on purchase)  
* Timely (sent within days, not weeks)  

# Best Practices for Email Cross-Sells:

* Wait 1–3 days after a purchase to send the email  
* Recommend 2–4 highly relevant products based on the last order  
* Offer a small discount to incentivize second purchases  
* Use product bundles or complementary items (e.g., bought a coffee machine? Offer pods or mugs)  

# Combining It All: A Shopify Growth Flywheel

Here’s how you can combine these strategies for maximum impact:

1. **Install Customer Journey Tracking**  
   * See where customers drop off  
   * Identify friction on product pages  
2. **Run Split Tests**  
   * Optimize product page layouts, CTAs, and copy  
3. **Set Up Behavioral Email Automation**  
   * Recover abandoned carts  
   * Trigger cross-sells based on purchase history  
4. **Use Behavioral Marketing On-Site**  
   * Smart popups, recommendation widgets, and AI-driven offers  

When these layers work together, you’re not just guessing what your customers want—you’re responding to their behavior in real time, at scale.

[Shopify email cross-sell automation](https://preview.redd.it/dsfvhlp0oref1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26ac1b1611edd99b784f67a60657400d413850ef)

# Final Thoughts

If you're looking to increase conversion rates, retention, and customer lifetime value, the answer isn't just more traffic. It's smarter optimization.

By implementing Shopify behavioral marketing, leveraging a customer journey dashboard, running split tests on product pages, and using automated cross-sell emails, you're turning every part of your funnel into a conversion opportunity.

Start with one strategy. Layer in more over time. The brands that win in 2025 will be the ones that use data to drive personalization and timing.

1m7wzxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1m7wzxd/8_days_in_ireland_skip_galway_connemara/,8 days in Ireland - skip Galway / Connemara?,"Hi everyone!

Would love some advice for mapping out 8 days planned in Ireland for early August.

Some information about us:  
\- 2 women in mid 30s, no mobility issues and have been walking in cities throughout Europe without issues thus far but we are not big hikers (1-2 hours, easy to medium hike with views is ideal for us; don't really enjoy 3-4+ hours steep incline hikes)  
\- we like scenic views (greenery, cliffs, ocean views), exploring cities/towns by walking, libraries/book shops, checking out local food scene (coffee/pastries, restaurants)  
\- not really big history buffs or architecture folks (1-2 castles from outside; not really interested in touring inside). cant drink alcohol right now either because of medication :(  
\- visiting in early August - flights booked; nothing else booked yet (eek!)  
\- mode of transport: driving rental car +/- train

Overall I'm trying to plan a more slow paced and relaxed trip where we will get to have lazy mornings and explore and take in our surroundings without feeling like we are rushing to get from one place to the next. Historically I tend to overplan and try to see too much, so I'm trying to make this feel more like a vacation to relax then to check things off a list. I also am trying to ensure that we are not getting too fatigued from driving / spending the whole trip in the car.

**This is our current plan:**  
Day 1: Arrive in Dublin in late afternoon / get settled in and relax  
Day 2: Explore Dublin  
Day 3: Travel to Killarney (thinking of taking a train from Dublin to help cut down on driving time)  
Day 4: Rent car; Ring of Kerry; stay in Killarney  
Day 5: Dingle Peninsula / Slea Head Drive; stay in Killarney  
Day 6: Travel from Killarney back to Dublin via train  
Day 7: Explore more of Dublin +/- Howth Village  
Day 8: Fly out of Dublin

**An alternate version of the itinerary is:**  
Day 6: Drive from Killarney to Galway / explore Galway  
Day 7: Sky Road / Connemara then  
\- drive to Dublin and return car to Dublin vs return car in Galway and train to Dublin  
Day 8: Fly out of Dublin

Do you think it would be a big mistake to skip out on Galey / Connemara? Am I overthinking the pace and driving aspects (in terms of fatigue, etc)? Any other thoughts or advice for my planned itinerary?

Thank you so much in advance for any help and guidance! I'm so excited for my upcoming trip :)",1,1753338674.0,irishtourism,4,1.0,False

# Order Notes

Six is angry at everyone. It seems like the whole Village betrayed him in the previous episode. His memory was erased, but how did everyone else not know the calendar was set back? This episode raises the possibility that the other Villagers might have been brainwashed by the Speed Learn program, but Six doesn’t know that.

At the start of *The General*, Six seems to be the only person in the Village unaware of what Speed Learn is. This can be explained by the fact that he was out of action for two weeks during *The Schizoid Man*. Without this juxtaposition, his ignorance would be harder to explain, but his two-week absence leaves him in the dark.

Despite his anger and confusion, when Six discovers a threat to the Village community, he acts to protect them. His deep-seated resentment doesn’t prevent him from taking action when he believes the Village is at risk. While he remains distrustful and frustrated with the system, his underlying sense of responsibility for the community’s safety remains intact. It’s a complex emotional moment for Six, as he is forced to confront the tension between his anger and his desire to protect others.

 

# SYNOPSIS

# Act One

Six is at the cafe when the PA begins to speak. It is a man’s voice, not the usual chipper woman. “This is an announcement from the General’s department. Will all students taking the three-part history course please return to their dwellings immediately. The Professor will be lecturing in approximately 30 minutes.” Everybody except Six gets up to leave. Six asks the waiter for more coffee, but the waiter tells him the cafe is closed for the lecture.

P sees a poster. Under the picture of a man it says, “Speed Learn. A three year course in three minutes. It can be done. Trust me. — The Professor.” The new Number Twelve approaches him. Six opines that the promise of Speed Learn is “improbable \[but\] nothing’s impossible in this place.”

On the beach, a crowd of people chases a man who, we will learn, is the Professor. Six, watching from a distance, finds a tape recorder buried in the sand. He listens to the recording. “Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Villagers, students, this is the Professor speaking. I have an *urgent message* for you.”

Seeing two people approach in a taxi, he hides the recorder in another location. They want to give him a ride home for the lecture and he accepts. The crowd catches the Professor. Six arrives at his cottage and thanks the taxi men for the ride.

The Professor appears on TV and says of Speed Learn, “A three-year course indelibly impressed upon the mind in three minutes.” He credits the General with making it possible.

Number 235 appears on the screen. “The subject of tonight’s lecture is Europe since Napoleon. A hard, complicated six-month study. Ladies and gentlemen, sit back, relax, watch the screen. We’re going to cover it in 15 seconds flat!” A hypnotic pattern with the Professor’s face appears on the TV for 15 seconds.

Number Two arrives with a technician. They’re looking for the Professor’s missing recorder. Two asks Six some history questions and Six answers, quoting the text word for word, with Two joining in for the latter part and they speak in unison. Two departs. Six picks up the phone and asks the operator some of the same questions. The operator gives the same answers word for word.

This is bad. We’re all about individualism here. Everybody giving the same word-for-word answers is not what we’re looking for. These are not just factual questions—there are questions about the causes and significance of historical events. We shouldn’t have everyone giving the exact same answer.

Six returns to the beach and looks for the recorder. It’s not where he left it. He finds Twelve hiding behind a bush. Twelve has the recorder, gives it to Six, and leaves. Six listens to the recording and hears the urgent message: “You are being tricked. Speed Learn is an abomination. It is slavery. If you wish to be free, there is only one way: Destroy the General!”

Time for Six to be the protector again—and this time, he isn’t being set up to succeed by the unknown powers behind the scenes. At least he has Twelve to help him. Doesn’t he?

# Act Two

The next day, as the band plays, people at the cafe happily ask each other history questions and congratulate each other on their word-perfect answers.

In the Green Dome, Two is telling someone on the red phone that everything is going great. Twelve arrives and gives an ambiguous report on the Professor’s health. Twelve criticizes the Professor: “We indulge his idiocies far too much. He’s a crank and should be treated as such…. He’s a troublemaker and he attracts troublemakers.” Two advises him that such opinions should be carefully guarded.

The Professor is working on his notes for the next lecture. A doctor and nurse arrive, telling him that it’s time for some rest and some mild therapy. As the nurse escorts him out of the room, the doctor takes the Professor’s notes and feeds them into a machine. The machine outputs something that looks like a metal punch card. (Hey, it was 1967.)

In a courtyard, the Professor’s wife is drawing, as are a number of other people, including Six. He signals her and she walks over to him. She has some odd ideas about art and creativity. Six hands him what he has been drawing: a picture of her dressed as a general. Offended, she rips it in half. P, you might want to check [this](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) out.

Six enters the Professor’s home. He discovers a room full of busts made by the Professor’s wife. I’m getting tired of typing “the Professor’s wife,” so let’s call her Betty, after the actress. Betty arrives, objecting to Six’s presence in a private room and demanding he leave. He doesn’t. He removes the cloths draped over the busts, further angering Betty. Among the busts he uncovers are ones of himself and Two. Also one of McKern’s Two, which was probably intended for the Art Exhibition.

Two enters, revealing the Professor’s bedroom behind the door. The Professor’s doctor is also there. Ignoring everyone’s objections, Six walks into the bedroom and strikes the Professor in the head with a cane. Hard. Betty screams in horror… then realizes that Six just destroyed a dummy. Where’s her husband? Definitely check out that book, P.

Two tells Six he has lost interest in the recorder. Six gives it to him and leaves.

At the cafe, people are partying. 235, with a microphone, asks people history questions and gets their perfect answers. Twelve watches with displeasure. Six arrives, gets “interviewed” by 235, and gives perfect answers.

Six returns to his cottage, and a light shorts out when he flips the switch. His phone rings. The voice on the other end tells him to stay put and wait for Electrics and Administration. Number 251 arrives from Electrics and Twelve from Administration. It’s not just the bulb; a short circuit damaged the lamp and 251 needs replacement parts.

While 251 goes outside to get the parts, Twelve and Six talk inside. Twelve gives Six a ballpoint pen. Inside is a micro cylinder containing the Professor’s “real” lecture, from the tape recording. He also gives him two passes that will get him into the studio from which Speed Learn is broadcast. Six is game.

# Act Three

The Professor is asleep in bed. It’s really him this time. The doctor assures Betty that he is doing fine and will be able to complete his lecture.

Men in top hats enter the studio and use their passes to get past the force field. Twelve is among them. One of the men gives Two a micro cylinder with the Professor’s lecture. Two regards it with satisfaction and takes it to the projection room. More men in top hats arrive. One of them is Six, who uses one of his passes to get in.

In the council chambers, Twelve addresses the other top hat guys (who now have their hats on the table). He credits the General with creating Speed Learn, talks of the Professor’s key role in making it work, and explains how it functions.

Six makes his way to the projection room. He attacks the technician and they fight. During the fight, Six is stabbed in the arm and it bleeds profusely, but he knocks out the technician. Posing as the technician, he reports that projection is ready, then swaps in the cylinder he got from Twelve.

While doing a video check of each of their key operations, including projection, the top hat guys see the projectionist’s (literally) bloody hand, which catches Two’s attention. They zoom in on the projectionist’s face and Two recognizes Six. He sends security to projection and they knock Six out. The Speed Learn broadcast begins, but they send out the original lecture, not the one Six swapped in.

In the chambers, Two and security officers watch as Twelve interrogates Six, who refuses to give up his coconspirators. (He’s a fool, not a rat.) Two disparages the “reactionary drivel” that Six almost sent out: the freedom to learn, the liberty to make mistakes. The phone rings. It’s Betty asking if she can see her husband. “As soon as he’s completed the next installment,” Two replies.

Two calls the General’s office. He claims, “The General can answer anything, given the basic facts.” Two brings Six and Twelve to the General’s office. It’s the same office where the Professor typed his lecture notes in Act Two, and the Professor is there now, typing away.

A curtain is drawn back and Two introduces the General—a giant (well, maybe not by 1967 standards) computer. He explains that the Professor created it and loves it passionately. Six says that Speed Learn is creating “a row of cabbages.” “Knowledgeable cabbages,” counters Two.

Two tells the Professor to take down a problem for the infallible General. First, the facts:

1. A traitor in the Village
2. Security pass discs were issued to Number Six
3. Access to these is through Administration
4. Number 12 is an official in Administration

In Two logic, that establishes guilt. He tells the Professor to ask the General…

“A question that cannot be answered!” interrupts Six. I’ll give him a pass on the interruption, sometimes it’s necessary. Two insists there is no such thing as a question the General can’t answer. Six says, then let me ask it. Two says no. Six says, “Are you afraid?” and Two answers, “Go ahead.”

Speed Learn is supposed to be teaching college courses, but this feels more like elementary school. Two gives Six unsupervised access to the General *on a dare*.

Six types his short question. Just four key presses. Nobody asks to see the question before Six feeds it to the General. The General starts sparking and smoking. The Professor tries to shut it down, but when he grabs an electrified handle it starts electrocuting him and he can’t let go.

Two tentatively walks toward the Professor, but is hesitant to get too close to the machine that looks ready to explode. The security men attack Six. Twelve runs up to the Professor and tries to pull him off the General while Six and the security officers keep each other occupied and Two doesn’t know what to do.

With one final explosion, the General is destroyed, and the Professor and Twelve fall to the floor, dead. Two demands to know what the question was. Six answers, “It’s insoluble for man or machine: W-H-Y-?” Two looks devastated. Six looks triumphant.

In the courtyard, Betty is alone when… Oh my God, they sent Six to break the news to Betty? Or he raced everybody there and won? Betty is devastated. Six walks away—excuse me, I meant Six walks into her house—leaving her alone in her grief.

# END SYNOPSIS

 

# Philosophical Fallout

Twelve may be the first Villager we meet besides Six who doesn’t seem to fit into Six’s two categories, the meek and the enemy. Or maybe second after the Count. Trying to save the Professor, Twelve dies a hero, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. He may be the most sympathetic character in the series. Six never got a chance to thank him before he died, so let me: Thank you, Twelve.

The Professor is a tragically conflicted character. He knows the General has to be destroyed, and gets that message out at considerable effort and personal risk. But he also loves it. When his message has the intended effect and the General starts to destroy itself, what does he do? He tries to stop it. In the moment, his emotions override the better judgment he expressed before. It kills him, and Twelve.

“Why”? Seriously, “Why”? Two mentions philosophy as one of the academic disciplines the General has mastered and in which it can answer any question, and it has never encountered “Why”? Here’s the answer the General blew up searching for: “The question is ill-defined.”

P has never been the most sensitive guy, but his treatment of Betty is a new level of callousness—and I’m saying that after he apparently drove another woman to suicide with his callousness. He introduces himself to Betty by taunting her with the offensive drawing. He trespasses into her home, continues to help himself while she insists he leave, then enters her husband’s bedroom, traumatizes her with the cane trick, and jokes about it. His “Why?” trick gets her husband killed and he doesn’t seem bothered. He breaks the news to Betty, then presumtuously trespasses into her home once again, leaving her to grieve alone in the courtyard. P, I know that operator was a right cow to you in the first episode, but this consistent cruelty towards women is a serious overreaction.

It makes it difficult to root for him, despite the good he does. He destroys the General, protecting the people of the Village—except for the two dead people and the widow, and he seems unconcerned with what other people paid for his victory. He is maybe not the best role model.

I don’t know how many times I watched this episode before noticing what a sympathetic character Betty is. When we first meet her, she expresses some kooky ideas. She doesn’t like our protagonist and lets him know it. This establishes her as antagonist and doesn’t invite viewers to consider her perspective after that. A similar pattern is seen with Eight in *Checkmate*—she’s something of a pest before she gets brainwashed, so who cares? There may be a lesson here for how we engage with telly—or with life. If you see Six mistreating Betty but didn’t see it before, consider whether you might have some similar blind spots in real life.

Why does Six draw Betty as a military general?

* To offend her?
* Because he sees her as the power giving all the orders?
* To prime the audience to see her as the enemy?

Me (30F) and my husband (34M) have been going through lots of imbalance last year, until it hit the point where we were fighting all the time and couldn't stand each other. 
We didn't hug, kiss, talk, or sometimes even sleep in the same bed. 
I didn't feel loved at all, and I felt like our marriage is going to end.
I kept trying, making his favorite meals, being a house wife, cleaning the house, on top of working full time. But nothing was good enough.
He decided that he's gonna go on a guys only trip with his buddy and then we can talk about our future.
I was working 13 hour shifts and I met someone at work, that gave me all the attention I craved so much. 
When my husband came home, we talked and he decided he needed more time alone, so he left to go to his friends place 9 hours away for few weeks.
In the meantime, I discovered I had some feelings for this person from work, that gave me all attention and compliments all the time. So couple weeks into my husband being gone, I told him that I met someone who lifts my spirits. 
His reaction was of course bad, he was very hurt and felt betrayed, which I understand. 
Few days later, he texted me asking if I'd be okay if he gave his number to this girl he met at the library, and landed her his book. He specified he is asking me out of respect to me and love he holds for me. I voiced that it'd probably make me feel uncomfortable, but he can if he felt like he wanted to. His response was ""I didn't do it, because I'm faithful and love only you, I wouldn't do that to you"". 
Long story short, I removed the other person out of my life and started working on my marriage to strengthen my relationship with my lovely husband.
Three months after we both decided we will work on our relationship and focus on us, I found out that the ABSOLUTELY gave her his number and they've been texting and flirting around. He even went to see her for a coffee in our city.
I came out to him that I was hurt, but he swept it off with ""You hurt me, I did nothing to compare to that"" and doesn't thing he did anything wrong.

## What is Turbo Iplex Hub?

Turbo Iplex Hub is a **multi-asset trading platform** that lets users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities. It blends **automated trading tools** with manual controls, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced traders. Think of it like a hybrid between a robo-advisor and a DIY trading terminal.

What grabbed my attention was how the platform uses **real-time data analysis** to give users updated market signals. It's basically a smart dashboard that takes the guesswork out of trading, which is especially helpful for people who aren’t glued to charts all day.

## Who Created Turbo Iplex Hub?

The exact founders of Turbo Iplex Hub are not publicly listed—something that’s becoming increasingly common in the fintech space, especially with crypto-related tools. That said, the platform appears to be backed by a team of developers and financial analysts, similar to other platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

While I always prefer transparency, the lack of founder info isn't necessarily a red flag if the platform is delivering results and protecting users' data. Plus, Turbo Iplex Hub works with **regulated broker partners**, which adds a layer of legitimacy.

With Labor Day deals expected to slash prices by $100–$200, this might be the best time to upgrade your phone and leave battery anxiety behind.

# 1. Why Fast Charging Phones Matter in 2025

We live in a fast-paced world — your phone needs to keep up. In 2025, charging speed has become one of the most underrated but critical features people look for in a smartphone.

Think about it: You’re heading out, your phone’s at 2%, and you’ve got 10 minutes. In 2020, you’d be doomed. But today? That’s enough time to hit 50% — or more.

This is especially crucial for:

* Commuters and remote workers  
* Students between lectures  
* Frequent travelers who can’t wait around  
* Anyone with chronic “low battery anxiety”  

# 2. Top Picks: Fastest Charging Phones This Year

**Here’s a quick comparison of the most impressive fast-charging phones in 2025:**

||
||
|**Phone**|**Charging Speed**|**Battery Size**|**Est. Time to 50%**|**Notes**|
|[OnePlus 12R](https://amzn.to/4lLGiG0)|100W SuperVOOC|5500mAh|\~8 minutes|Performance beast at mid-range price|
|[Xiaomi 14 Pro](https://amzn.to/4o5wR5O)|120W HyperCharge|5000mAh|\~7 minutes|Fastest on the list|
|[Samsung S24 Ultra](https://amzn.to/4lDHECB)|45W Fast Charging|5000mAh|\~20 minutes|Best battery health management|
|[iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://amzn.to/4kUQjiP)|27W USB-C|4400mAh|\~30–35 minutes|Balanced but slower|
|[Realme GT Neo 6](https://amzn.to/44KCX3T)|150W Flash Charge|4600mAh|\~6–7 minutes|Incredible value, less availability in the US|

Note: Charging times may vary slightly depending on cable, charger, and temperature.

# 3. Battery Speed Meets Practical Life

It’s not just about numbers anymore. In the real world, battery anxiety is *real* — and no one wants to wait an hour for a top-up when you’re waiting for an Uber or your next Netflix binge.

Phones like the [OnePlus 12R](https://amzn.to/4lLGiG0) or[ Xiaomi 14 Pro](https://amzn.to/4o5wR5O) make a real difference. You plug in while making coffee, and by the time your toast pops up, your phone’s ready to go.

That kind of convenience feels futuristic — but it’s here now.

# 4. Labor Day Deals Preview – What to Expect

Here’s where it gets even more interesting.

Last Labor Day, Amazon lightning deals on phones sold out within hours. Some devices had $100–$200 price drops, especially on previous-gen flagships and high-speed chargers bundled in.

Based on early deal teasers, we’re expecting:

* [$100+ off OnePlus 12R](https://amzn.to/4lLGiG0)
* Bundle discounts on Xiaomi phones + charging bricks  
* [Samsung S24 Ultra ](https://amzn.to/4lDHECB)trade-in deals up to $500 off  
* Bank card cashbacks from major retailers  

Tip: Add the phone to your cart or wishlist now, and monitor Amazon’s lightning deals 2–3 days before Labor Day weekend.

# 5. My Personal Take: Which One Would I Buy?

*If I had to pick one phone right now — combining* ***fast charging, price, and thermal management*** *— I’d go with the* [***OnePlus 12R***](https://amzn.to/4lLGiG0)*.*

*Why?*

* You’re getting **100W SuperVOOC**, which actually delivers the speed it promises.  
* It rarely overheats.  
* You’re not paying $1,200 like the [S24 Ultra.](https://amzn.to/4lDHECB)
* It nails the balance between flagship experience and price point.  

*It’s not just a phone that charges fast — it’s a phone that feels fast, every day.*

 ***Update****: I recently saw this model listed at a much lower price than usual on Amazon — so if you’ve been considering an upgrade, you might want to* [***check if it’s still live here*** ](https://amzn.to/4lLGiG0)*before it disappears again.*

 *If you’ve ever said “ugh, my phone’s dead again,” this might be the upgrade you didn’t know you needed.*

# 6. Final Thoughts – Time to Charge Up?

2025 is the year charging speed finally got the spotlight it deserves.

And with the Labor Day sale season heating up, there’s a rare window where tech meets savings. Whether you’re eyeing the blazing-fast [Xiaomi 14 Pro](https://amzn.to/4o5wR5O) or the well-balanced [S24 Ultra,](https://amzn.to/4lDHECB) one thing’s clear — slow charging is no longer acceptable.

So if you’ve been holding back, this might be the perfect time to make the switch.
