I started tracking my habits around 2 years ago. At first, it was just for fun‚ÄîI liked seeing colorful charts and data in my app. I figured it would also help me stay on track, but mainly, I liked knowing I was trying. Over time, I tracked more things‚Äîcat litter, meditation, coffee, mood, alcohol, etc. But I realized that tracking didn‚Äôt help me create new habits. It just tracked things I was already doing.

What did help me improve was seeing patterns in the data. I noticed things that made me unhappy, like skipping workouts or leaving the litter for days. This pushed me to do better. Habit tracking wasn‚Äôt about building habits directly‚Äîit was about identifying what I wanted to change. Once I knew what to fix, staying disciplined became easier, and I didn‚Äôt need motivation.

**TLDR:**¬†Tracking habits doesn‚Äôt create them, but it helps you see what needs improvement. Once you know what to change, discipline becomes easier.

1hyg8z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/satisfactory/comments/1hyg8z4/youre_bad_at_pipes_but_it_isnt_your_fault/,"You're bad at pipes, but it isn't your fault","There have been many, many threads and discussions around the quality and nature of pipes and in particular fluid dynamics in Satisfactory. We've all either seen or posted something claiming that pipes are buggy or otherwise not working correctly. Of course, the more seasoned of us know that this isn't the case, it's simply that the fluid model used in Satisfactory is fairly complex and subject to obscure forces.

Now it's easy to dismiss this dismay and call it noobishness, but I disagree. I don't think it's entirely reasonable that people should need to go out and read a 24 page PDF explaining how fluids work and examples of how to use engineering to bend fundamental physics to their will. In my opinion, it is a failing of Satisfactory to provide the necessary information to effectively use pipes.

Now I'm not saying that the game should be dragged to a halt in order to tutorialize college level science. Rather, I feel that Coffee Stain could greatly benefit their players by offering any amount of information showing clearly and concisely just what the fluids are doing inside the pipes, so that the player can learn through experimentation.

As a simple example, the most basic of basics- head lift. When you apply a pump to a pipe, there is a visual indicator showing the effective head lift it will provide. I think it would be reasonable to allow an overlay that will show the head lift currently being provided to the pipe network in a similar way. Or alternatively, some kind of overlay-based indicator to easily see that the fluid isn't getting high enough.

This could be expanded further. The pipes know what the fluids in them are doing. We have a fullness indicator on the pipes, and reading the pipe will give you basic flow information. An overlay could be applied to this to simulate the fluid activity within the pipes, making all this information more easily accessible and viewable in reference to other parts of the pipe network.

This would be hugely beneficial for players of every skill level, and help demystify a lot of the complexities of fluid handling.",4,1736546500.0,satisfactory,0,1.0,False

For about a month straight, i felt like their tag was near me or on me. I was constantly feeling the need to check every place i was at, in search for this tag. One day i was going on my normal walk. But i started  my route slightly different then normal. I looked over at a trash bin. This bin has several tags. And there it was ONE was theirs. It was in walking distance from my car and i could see it from my apartment window. Ever since i saw the tag that feeling disappeared. I talked to my ex and they mentioned they put the tag their when we were dating.

I feel like I am being underpaid, scapegoated, and generally treated like crap. After the last incident where we were given a day off, then chewed out publicly for taking that day off, I decided to start job hunting. After reviewing my contract, I realized that if I leave in the next 3 months, I will be responsible for paying back the company for some classes they paid for. I also want to use up my remaining health benefits since I will mostly go a few months without insurance when I start a new position (Our deductibles reset in March). So, in the meantime, I am sprucing up my resume, setting my doctor's appointments, and looking into applying for new jobs.

However, January is also the time when I got my last raise and the owner is having all kinds of ""financial"" meetings which everyone is hoping means we will get another raise. If they decide to give me a large raise (like $20K), I might stay. 

We are responsible for keeping a document with our job duties and daily tasks, which we call our SOP; the VP has asked us recently to refresh our SOP. 

When I went to refresh it, I realized I do A LOT more than what I originally put on the document. For example, I do a lot of secretarial things like making coffee, washing dishes, taking out the trash, locking up, organizing the stock room, etc. I am NOT a secretary- I'm a highly skilled title abstractor. But if I don't do these things, they often just don't get done. Sometimes I get fed up that I'm the only person who does them and I will quit for a few weeks but I can't stand dirt and filth (we have a cleaning service but they only come once a week. If I waited for them to take out the trash, we would have 6 bags piled up in the kitchen) so I eventually start doing them again.

If I don't get the raise I want, I am considering asking for it and I will use my SOP as well as some recent projects as justification. Do I bother putting these kinds of duties on my SOP? Does that make me more or less valuable? ",1,1736546227.0,Career,0,1.0,False

Yeah, me too. I once *completely* bungled a big work presentation... like, forgot-my-own-name level of nerves. But you know what? Failure isn't the end; it's the initiation into the 'human club.' üéâ Welcome!

Bouncing back is more of an art than a science, and lucky for us, the paint's free and the canvas is infinite. So, let‚Äôs dive into the colorful mess of learning from failure.

**1. Embrace the Suck üß†**

It‚Äôs tempting to run and hide after a flop. But what if you faced it head-on? It hurts, but it‚Äôs temporary. The best part? Every time you acknowledge it, it loses a bit of power. *Ask yourself: what could I have done differently?* Your future self is *so* ready to answer.

**2. *Permission to Fail* Granted üöÄ**

Ever notice that nobody has ever told a major success story without a ‚Äò...and then, I failed‚Äô segment? It‚Äôs like baked into the recipe of greatness. Hey, even the legendary Steve Jobs got booted from Apple! Use that perspective to grant yourself permission to fail without fearing judgment.

**3. Laugh at Your Blunders üòÇ**

Picture this: you spill coffee on your shirt and go to that job interview anyway. Imagine telling the story to your grandkids one day. Ridiculous, right? But that‚Äôs the beauty of it! Humor is a reality check‚Äîa reminder that life doesn‚Äôt end with embarrassment.

**4. Break It Down Like a High School Math Problem ‚ûó**

Every failure has variables. Dig in: *Where did things go awry? Who was involved? What was your mindset?* Treat it like problem-solving, not soul-crushing. Once you crack the variables, you‚Äôre basically setting up the comeback game plan.

**5. Talk to Someone Who Gets It üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**

Community is key. Ever had that friend who just *knows* what you‚Äôre going through? Share your story, listen to theirs, and exchange a secret handshake of solidarity. You‚Äôre both part of the Phoenix Club now‚Äîrising from ashes and chalking it up as experience.

**6. Channel Your Inner Scientist üß™**

Experiment with new approaches. Failed a test? Try a new study method. Botched a project? Prototype new ideas. Each failure is data‚Äîand your life? One big research project. Hypothesize, test, analyze, and repeat!

So, there it is, friends‚Äîa few strokes of the bounce-back brush. Remember, stumbling doesn‚Äôt define us; it refines us. Share your bounce-back story if you feel like it, or just enjoy the ride.

Cushion cut diamonds offer a unique blend of vintage charm and modern elegance, making them a popular choice for engagement rings. Here are the key points to consider:

* **Distinctive Shape**: Square or rectangular outline with softly rounded edges, resembling a pillow.
* **Cost-Effective**: Generally 30% less expensive per carat than round diamonds.
* **Versatile Style**: Ideal for vintage-inspired designs and halo settings.
* **Complex Selection**: Requires more expertise to choose the right one compared to other cuts.
* **Color Consideration**: Tends to show color more, so H grade or better is recommended.
* **Clarity Guideline**: VS2 or better usually ensures an eye-clean appearance.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

I am 5'11'' and \~200lbs (somewhere between 15-20% body fat)

Everything came back normal except my LDL was elevated around 150.

I have been trying to deduct what the cause of this may be.

Truthfully I eat the same things almost everyday, therefore I am looking at these foods as the culprit:

Breakfast is typically a single egg sandwich I make (1 egg - 2 pieces of toast (lightly buttered) with some cracked pepper over it) or a bowl of plain cheerios (no honey nut) with Fairlife milk. Decaf coffee with a very very small amount of Fairlife milk, mainly to cool the coffee off quicker.

I typically skip lunch or have a drink of water or more decaf coffee (the only 2 things I ever drink).

Dinner is almost always one chicken breast (\~12oz) lightly seasoned with Mediterranean seasoning (no fats in the seasoning, just a small amount of sodium); 1/2 cup of rice (sauteed with a small amount of butter) and then boiled (obviously); and a fair heaping of vegetables (broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix).

I go to the gym 2-3 days a week for \~1h each time with a mix of light cardio, and weight lifting. I have a very efficient, and tailored regime every week that I know works well.

i‚Äôve (28male) got this coworker who i‚Äôve gradually developed feelings for. we‚Äôve flirted since we started working together (say august-ish) and after a while i was like, man i think this woman likes me. the way she looks at me, her body language, just everything. imwe even developed a routine where she gets me breakfast on fridays and i get her coffee in tuesdays. so there‚Äôs some caretaking going on there . 

bout a month ago, i kind wanted some clarity. i like the flirting and buying gifts, but it was getting kinda intense. so i told her, after. a work party and was a bit tipsy but not drunk lol, that i respect her relationship with her boyfriend and i won‚Äôt make a move or anything to make her uncomfortable, but i have real feelings for her and i wanna if im being delusional and just reading into things wrong. later that night , she calls me and says she feels the exact same, and sometimes she‚Äôs worried that she‚Äôll do things with me that she shouldn‚Äôt do, and maybe we need to relax. it hurt, but im like alright .

the next day , after our breakup of some sorts lol, was just awful. we were ignoring each other and both of us were just miserable. we talked after work and i told her ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to feel like that again‚Äù and we both b agreed we‚Äôd go back to regular routine . so we‚Äôre flowing and end up getting christmas gifts for each other lmao . we go christmas shopping and i hold her hand while we drive. like we‚Äôre doing some shit here lol

Here is what I own so far. Some of these are samples, some of these are .5oz.

I have done a deep dive into Paris hotels and am struggling to make up my mind on a 6 night stay in October. We last stayed at [Madame Reve](https://madamereve.com/en/) and it was fine but we'd like to stay outside of central city this time. 

**Budget** | $350 - $600 (I know this is a wide range but we will be with my parents who are more price-sensitive so while my husband and I can upgrade our room the baseline needs to be more modest).

**Location** | Extremely open and eager to explore a new area as we've both spent time in the city. Was thinking of Batignolles, Canal St-Martin or somewhere left bank but, as I said, super open.

**Priorities** | I am all about price-value and love design so am always looking for hotels featuring beautiful spaces, warm and comfortable rooms and great bars. I love unique or classic when done right. We don't do hotel breakfasts (too busy coffee & pastry-hunting), views are nice but not a requirement, we tend to not use amenities like gyms or the concierge. Essentially looking for the best bang for our buck in that weird in-between space of super luxurious and budget hotels.

So far I have landed on the following options and I'd LOVE to hear anyone's experiences (bad or good) and also recommendations!

* [H√¥tel Providence](https://hotelprovidenceparis.com/)

Also looked at H√¥tel Le Cinq Codet, H√¥tel du Temps, [Hotel Monte Cristo](https://www.hotelmontecristoparis.com/), [Hotel Dame des Arts](https://www.damedesarts.com/en/), [Hotel des Grand Voyageurs](https://www.hoteldesgrandsvoyageurs.com/) and H√¥tel Le Six.

This will be the end of a month long trip and I haven't had issues with any other hotel research but Paris always proves to be challenging because it's so massive and there are so many (seemingly) beautiful hotels.

A Future Written in Shared Glances

Picture this: a crowded train carving its way through the city, every seat filled with quiet stories and unspoken thoughts. The hum of the wheels is steady, almost hypnotic, until our eyes meet across the aisle. It‚Äôs not just a glance‚Äîit‚Äôs a thread, delicate but unbreakable, weaving us into a moment neither of us expected. The conversation that follows feels easy, like stepping into the warmth of a familiar melody. By the time the train slows, it feels like the journey wasn‚Äôt about the destination but the person who made it unforgettable.

Perhaps it‚Äôs fate, or perhaps it‚Äôs just timing, but here I am now, extending this moment to you. If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of a story that begins with serendipity and grows into something real, let‚Äôs start that conversation. Let‚Äôs create the kind of connection that turns ordinary days into extraordinary ones.

About Me

I‚Äôm a quiet soul with a curious heart‚Äîa writer who sees poetry in the mundane, a dreamer collecting moments like stars, and someone who treasures the small, fleeting joys of life. I find magic in golden-hour light, songs that speak to your soul, and words that linger long after they‚Äôre spoken.

I‚Äôm not someone who needs grand adventures every day, but I‚Äôll never shy away from chasing them when they call. Whether it‚Äôs wandering an unfamiliar street, hiking to the kind of view that takes your breath away, or losing track of time over coffee and conversation, I seek the beauty in both the extraordinary and the quiet in-between.

I hope to start with friendship‚Äîauthentic, natural, and full of possibility. Every great story begins with a single word, and I‚Äôd love for ours to start here.


---

What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm searching for a kindred spirit‚Äîa woman who carries kindness like a quiet strength, whose curiosity is a window into a world I can‚Äôt wait to discover. Someone who finds beauty in life‚Äôs smallest details and isn‚Äôt afraid to dream big, to laugh loud, or to sit quietly and just be.

I want to build something together‚Äîa shared world where we celebrate life‚Äôs quirks, explore its mysteries, and craft dreams into reality. Whether it‚Äôs the simplicity of a shared playlist, spontaneous road trips, or building a project we‚Äôre both passionate about, I‚Äôm looking for a partner to grow with, someone ready to co-author a life full of meaning.


---

What Sets Me Apart

I notice the little things‚Äîthe way the sky blushes pink just before the sun dips below the horizon, the way your voice changes when you talk about something you love. I‚Äôll remember your favorite coffee, the song that makes you cry, or the story you can‚Äôt stop telling. These details are the threads I weave into the fabric of connection, creating something strong and lasting.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I‚Äôm the one who shows up‚Äînot just for the big moments but for the everyday ones too. I‚Äôll send a text to make you smile on a hard day or plan an impromptu evening under the stars when the world feels too heavy.

I‚Äôm a romantic at heart, but not in clich√©s. I believe in the kind of gestures that make you feel truly seen‚Äîa handwritten note tucked into your bag, a playlist that feels like it was made just for you, or a Sunday turned magical because we chose to make it so.


---

If you feel that spark, let‚Äôs talk. Let‚Äôs trade stories and dreams, uncover what makes each other‚Äôs worlds shine, and see where this journey might lead. Because sometimes, all it takes is one message to start a chapter that feels like it was always meant to be.

mother is 50s. 

quick background; she lost her deputy managerial job around 3 years ago due to a legal dispute, and from what she tells me, had a rough childhood, has lost family to suicide and cancer, and now has anxiety, depression and is diagnosed with BPD. 

my partner and i recently bought a house and got engaged, but we are yet to move out. we are currently living with his parents, who are not together (as far as i can tell? they refer to each other as their partner but they never talk, only argue). 

his father has slept on the couch for as long as my partner has been alive, and he works constantly. no holidays or days off. he is clearly at his limit.

i should note they have an older son, in his 30s. he is a train wreck of a person to put it simply, and has caused a lot of family stress and is a constant point of contention.

This is where the problems originated. My partner has worked incredibly hard from the moment he could, saving up a ridiculous amount of money from working every hour god has sent him. He is doing extremely well for himself and i couldn‚Äôt be prouder as his partner. 

However, his parents don‚Äôt seem to agree. His mother swings wildly between ‚Äúi‚Äôm so proud of my son, he‚Äôs doing so well‚Äù to ‚Äúhe‚Äôs cocky, selfish and doesn‚Äôt respect us‚Äù. The latter often happens when my partner refuses to fund her absolutely destructive shopping addiction. it is OUT OF CONTROL. Just yesterday she spent a whole 30 minutes ranting to me about how he‚Äôs stuck up his own ass and doesn‚Äôt respect her (while crying) because he wouldn‚Äôt buy her new gel pens. 

This might sound minute, but over the past 3 years my partner has spent thousands on her. For christmas, we got her a coffee machine, candles, designer bags. We more than often refill her coffee pods, I buy her snacks at the shop, etc. But when she gets her minimal amount of benefits, it disappears, and the most ridiculous parcels turn up that join the pile of junk that fills every god damn corner of their house. Every room is stuffed, and god forgive me, filthy. I keep my partner and i‚Äôs room tidy, and i will often clean the kitchen top to bottom. But after she goes in there for even five minute, it looks like a bomb has hit it. Food, liquids, scraps and dirty pots and plates everywhere. More than once she has come home from being at her therapist and screamed at us for a single plate (hers) in the sink even though i‚Äôve cleaned literally everything else.

As well as this, her anger is explosive. she will scream, shout, throw things, saying the most horribly offensive things to get under someone‚Äôs skin. we have only been here since September and she has already threatened to throw us out more than i can count. Bear in mind, she pays NOTHING. my partner pays rent to his father, pays the electric, and all of his own bills. her only task is to order the food shopping and she doesn‚Äôt even do this. when she does, she does it completely wrong, only making sure to get her own items, and tells us all if we are unhappy we should do it ourselves. she holes herself up in her room most of the time, shouting over video calls to random people until 4am. sleeping until noon. 

it‚Äôs unbearable for me, because i simply cannot do anything right. she has insinuated that it‚Äôs my fault that my partner is ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù (he is standing up for himself for once) and says really strange things about how it ‚Äúfelt good to give birth to him‚Äù and stares at me to see my reaction. she often badmouths my partner when he isn‚Äôt there, and then brings up things to him when i‚Äôm not there, to test and see if i have told him. first few times this happened he didn‚Äôt realise and would lay into her, and she would lie and turn it around on me. 

not only this, i‚Äôm constantly being asked to cook. i‚Äôm trying to study, i‚Äôm in online university, and i am not even uncomfortable with cooking. i‚Äôm fine with it. she‚Äôs just never happy with it. she makes faces as if it‚Äôs gross, doesn‚Äôt eat it, gives it to the dog, or complains i didn‚Äôt make enough or made too much. i‚Äôve stopped cooking for the family now as it was making me cry myself to sleep. just tonight i made dinner for my partner and i, she must have been able to smell it because i heard her go downstairs after i came up, then came up the stairs slamming every door as hard as she possibly could behind her. 

his father seems to have given up almost completely, resigned himself apart from the usual ‚Äútidy your room‚Äù and telling him he needs to learn to drive (he is learning). he is nice to me, sometimes a bit snippy, but when it comes to my partners mother, he tells it to ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù. he doesn‚Äôt make things any better. when she tries to talk to him, he‚Äôs immediately on the defensive and so, even a ‚Äúhow was work‚Äù becomes a screaming match with name calling.

i came from an incredibly abusive household and extended family, and this all is horrible for me. the slamming doors makes me jump, she often will burst into our room and scream at my partner with me standing in the middle, my partner doesn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs ‚Äúused to it‚Äù and says he just drowns out her voice. i can‚Äôt do that. i have constant nightmares again, a lot of old trauma is coming up that i thought id dealt with long ago.

i want to start a family with my partner. i want to have kids and a happy life, but his family are absolutely ruining this view for me. i can‚Äôt imagine letting his mother near our children. she is on so many medications that she isn‚Äôt supposed to drink and still does, and her house is too disgusting for me to even imagine letting my kids here. the disrespect she‚Äôs shown to our personal items too, makes me not want to welcome her often into our new home. 

i‚Äôm at my wits end, my partner has been standing up for me more and more, but that isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs missing. i can‚Äôt stand to be around her. i have been nice to her this whole time, and what she doesn‚Äôt know is im the only reason her son still talks to her at all. he has hated her for the past 3 years, how she financially uses him and manipulates him, never pays him back, yet prioritises buying designer items and gifts for online ‚Äúfriends‚Äù she has never met. 

she reminds me too much of my own mother, though she has never physically abused my partner, i dont think it makes a difference. i‚Äôm just exhausted and at my wits end. i dont want to leave my partner or further damage an already fractured family. however, i can‚Äôt put up with this for the rest of my life. even moving out, feels like there will still be problems as our new house is only 10 minutes by car. any advice is appreciated

TLDR my partners mother is very very difficult to deal with, and is making my life (and my partners) hell. How can i cope with this?",9,1736544792.0,JUSTNOMIL,10,1.0,False

I think I am being cheaped out of the work I am doing, I get paid 100 a week to clean their house. It is a big two story and some weeks they don't pay me. So I haven't been working as hard as I did I am also gonna find a job. Bc this was just for the time being till I get one and it's been months, they never said this is to help me out they just asked if I could do it. So I'm just using it to get me some extra money. But I feel overwhelmed with it. Also bc I am being paid less than average, for cleaning a big house and they dont even pick up after theirself like the mom and the dad will leave pss in the toilet, the brother  will leave coffee grounds all over the coffee bar, their dog üí©'s and pss everywhere no one will pick it up and leave it till i do it. they never showed me how they wanted their stuff done they just let me do it, and his mom gets picky with the way I do stuff but then again. I wasn't trained I was just thrown into the job, I get no appreciation not even by my boyfriend half the time. I just feel like I'm being used. Bc I'm too nice and will clean bc all I want is respect and to show that i care, but all I'm getting is none..  the list below is what she wants me to do but that's not even half the stuff I do I do the laundry like folding the towels. And other small detailed stuff that comes with cleaning and  that's not in the text. I can't find the photo if I find it I will add it to it but moday: vacuum stairs and upstairs, her room and the guest bedroom pretty simple other than vacuuming the stairs. Tuesday: dust around the house and in her room. Wednesday: clean all three bathrooms toilets, mirrors, counters, sink the whole nine yards. Thursday: vacuum and mop the floors downstairs, and the bathrooms, friday: clean the whole kitchen, wipe everything clean off all counters clean the stove backboards microwave, wipe the cabinets if they have drips, clean the bar, and coffeebar. Their house isnt small and it has lots of stuff to dust and wipe and just a lot. And understand she is a mom and gets upset, more like turns into a b, when dishes are in the sink. But it's from them as well, and they said they would help and any dish i use i wash its a habit but i always try using plastic bc thats what i am used to at my house and i dont have to wash after myself, i pick up and stretch myself further than what i have to and get their mess too, even when i am not cleaning for my ""job"" Bc if i dont itll just pile up for me. I feel bad half the time, bc i am very empathetic, so I do my best but then again I shouldn't with the way she is towards me, and paying me like I am some peasant that is with her son.",0,1736544764.0,Advice,12,0.5,False

I moved out of our apartment that I helped make into a home. Once my stuff was packed, I realized how much of that space was me. As much as you spoke of building a house together, you never really wanted to play house, not like I did. It was so easy to divide our things. I bought most of it for myself, really. You never cared, nor did you want to participate. You didn't care what I took either. I took my books and my blankets and my favorite mugs. I left you the wooden coffee table that my dad made. I wonder how long before you look at that table and no longer think of me.

The first week was hell. I lost weight, appetite, sleep, ability to focus. All I could think about was how could you. You said you loved me. You said you'd never hurt me. Then I found out you had been cheating. For the last year, at least. And you lied about it. Then you let me catch you lying. You handled this in the worst way I could imagine. You could've just said you wanted her. I never wanted you as much as she seems to. I would've let you go sooner and saved us a whole year. That last year was just so painful.

Finding out about your cheating helped me move on though. Now I know I was not crazy for suspecting something was going on. I saw all the signs and chose to trust that you're honest. I don't respect you anymore. You're a coward for lying about something so trivial. I could never love a coward. 

I started therapy. I hired a personal trainer and started going to the gym - like you always wanted me to. I signed up for dance classes. Got back into my yoga practice. Today, I moved into my own place, after staying with a friend for the past few weeks, living out of a suitcase. First night here. It's exciting and scary. I cried a little. I want to listen to new music again. I want to travel, go places, meet new people. Set up new routines. I want to live. I feel lighter. Relieved.

I don't miss you. You were holding me back. I was probably holding you back too. We never learned how to communicate. You were right, we are too different. The universe was trying to warn us all along. Everything was always difficult. It was never easy with you. This really is for the best, for both of us. ",1,1736543912.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

quick background; she lost her deputy managerial job around 3 years ago due to a legal dispute, and from what she tells me, had a rough childhood, has lost family to suicide and cancer, and now has anxiety, depression and is diagnosed with BPD. 

my partner and i recently bought a house and got engaged, but we are yet to move out. we are currently living with his parents, who are not together (as far as i can tell? they refer to each other as their partner but they never talk, only argue). 

his father has slept on the couch for as long as my partner has been alive, and he works constantly. no holidays or days off. he is clearly at his limit.

i should note they have an older son, in his 30s. he is a train wreck of a person to put it simply, and has caused a lot of family stress and is a constant point of contention.

This is where the problems originated. My partner has worked incredibly hard from the moment he could, saving up a ridiculous amount of money from working every hour god has sent him. He is doing extremely well for himself and i couldn‚Äôt be prouder as his partner. 

However, his parents don‚Äôt seem to agree. His mother swings wildly between ‚Äúi‚Äôm so proud of my son, he‚Äôs doing so well‚Äù to ‚Äúhe‚Äôs cocky, selfish and doesn‚Äôt respect us‚Äù. The latter often happens when my partner refuses to fund her absolutely destructive shopping addiction. it is OUT OF CONTROL. Just yesterday she spent a whole 30 minutes ranting to me about how he‚Äôs stuck up his own ass and doesn‚Äôt respect her (while crying) because he wouldn‚Äôt buy her new gel pens. 

This might sound minute, but over the past 3 years my partner has spent thousands on her. For christmas, we got her a coffee machine, candles, designer bags. We more than often refill her coffee pods, I buy her snacks at the shop, etc. But when she gets her minimal amount of benefits, it disappears, and the most ridiculous parcels turn up that join the pile of junk that fills every god damn corner of their house. Every room is stuffed, and god forgive me, filthy. I keep my partner and i‚Äôs room tidy, and i will often clean the kitchen top to bottom. But after she goes in there for even five minute, it looks like a bomb has hit it. Food, liquids, scraps and dirty pots and plates everywhere. More than once she has come home from being at her therapist and screamed at us for a single plate (hers) in the sink even though i‚Äôve cleaned literally everything else.

As well as this, her anger is explosive. she will scream, shout, throw things, saying the most horribly offensive things to get under someone‚Äôs skin. we have only been here since September and she has already threatened to throw us out more than i can count. Bear in mind, she pays NOTHING. my partner pays rent to his father, pays the electric, and all of his own bills. her only task is to order the food shopping and she doesn‚Äôt even do this. when she does, she does it completely wrong, only making sure to get her own items, and tells us all if we are unhappy we should do it ourselves. she holes herself up in her room most of the time, shouting over video calls to random people until 4am. sleeping until noon. 

it‚Äôs unbearable for me, because i simply cannot do anything right. she has insinuated that it‚Äôs my fault that my partner is ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù (he is standing up for himself for once) and says really strange things about how it ‚Äúfelt good to give birth to him‚Äù and stares at me to see my reaction. she often badmouths my partner when he isn‚Äôt there, and then brings up things to him when i‚Äôm not there, to test and see if i have told him. first few times this happened he didn‚Äôt realise and would lay into her, and she would lie and turn it around on me. 

not only this, i‚Äôm constantly being asked to cook. i‚Äôm trying to study, i‚Äôm in online university, and i am not even uncomfortable with cooking. i‚Äôm fine with it. she‚Äôs just never happy with it. she makes faces as if it‚Äôs gross, doesn‚Äôt eat it, gives it to the dog, or complains i didn‚Äôt make enough or made too much. i‚Äôve stopped cooking for the family now as it was making me cry myself to sleep. just tonight i made dinner for my partner and i, she must have been able to smell it because i heard her go downstairs after i came up, then came up the stairs slamming every door as hard as she possibly could behind her. 

his father seems to have given up almost completely, resigned himself apart from the usual ‚Äútidy your room‚Äù and telling him he needs to learn to drive (he is learning). he is nice to me, sometimes a bit snippy, but when it comes to my partners mother, he tells it to ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù. he doesn‚Äôt make things any better. when she tries to talk to him, he‚Äôs immediately on the defensive and so, even a ‚Äúhow was work‚Äù becomes a screaming match with name calling.

i came from an incredibly abusive household and extended family, and this all is horrible for me. the slamming doors makes me jump, she often will burst into our room and scream at my partner with me standing in the middle, my partner doesn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs ‚Äúused to it‚Äù and says he just drowns out her voice. i can‚Äôt do that. i have constant nightmares again, a lot of old trauma is coming up that i thought id dealt with long ago.

i want to start a family with my partner. i want to have kids and a happy life, but his family are absolutely ruining this view for me. i can‚Äôt imagine letting his mother near our children. she is on so many medications that she isn‚Äôt supposed to drink and still does, and her house is too disgusting for me to even imagine letting my kids here. the disrespect she‚Äôs shown to our personal items too, makes me not want to welcome her often into our new home. 

i‚Äôm at my wits end, my partner has been standing up for me more and more, but that isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs missing. i can‚Äôt stand to be around her. i have been nice to her this whole time, and what she doesn‚Äôt know is im the only reason her son still talks to her at all. he has hated her for the past 3 years, how she financially uses him and manipulates him, never pays him back, yet prioritises buying designer items and gifts for online ‚Äúfriends‚Äù she has never met. 

she reminds me too much of my own mother, though she has never physically abused my partner, i dont think it makes a difference. i‚Äôm just exhausted and at my wits end. i dont want to leave my partner or further damage an already fractured family. however, i can‚Äôt put up with this for the rest of my life. even moving out, feels like there will still be problems as our new house is only 10 minutes by car. any advice is appreciated

1hyf8lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalGrowthGoals/comments/1hyf8lj/celebrating_the_small_wins_the_power_of/,Celebrating the Small Wins: The Power of Micro-Victories,"Sometimes, when we set out to achieve big goals, it‚Äôs easy to get overwhelmed by how far we have to go. That‚Äôs why celebrating every small step‚Äîevery ‚Äúmicro-victory‚Äù‚Äîis so important. These little wins might seem insignificant on the surface, but each one represents tangible progress toward where you want to be. Recognizing them keeps you motivated, boosts confidence, and reminds you that you‚Äôre moving forward, even if the ultimate finish line is still on the horizon.

Think of it like building a house: you don‚Äôt just applaud when the entire structure is finished. You celebrate when the foundation is laid, when the walls go up, and when the roof is finally installed. In personal growth, micro-victories can be anything from finally waking up on time for a morning workout, to writing the first page of your book, to simply hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù on that email you‚Äôve been dreading. Each of these steps is a milestone in its own right.

It also helps to mark these achievements in a tangible way. You might keep a journal where you jot down your ‚Äúwin of the day‚Äù or set up a reward system‚Äîlike treating yourself to a nice cup of coffee or a short break when you reach a mini-goal. This isn‚Äôt about self-indulgence; it‚Äôs about reinforcing the positive behavior that got you that victory in the first place.

Finally, remember that what matters is consistent progress, not perfection. When you string together a series of small wins, they add up to something big over time. And by celebrating each milestone, you‚Äôre training your mind to notice success more than setbacks. That mental shift can do wonders for your motivation and overall sense of accomplishment.

When the link is clicked you get taken to the regular enlistment site‚Ä¶ no mention of old vets re-upping.

Just click bait? Or has the  military actually figured out a way to tap the expertise of our aging community?
There‚Äôs a lot of highly qualified seniors out here who have expertise to contribute, if used correctly, so the idea has some merit.

How to filter out and in those seniors who actually have something to offer would be needed. Seniors have valuable management and technical level expertise and we have those who might be able to make good coffee and not much more.

On the higher end of the senior expertise sprectrum you would need to have command leadership that makes sense and is actually mission oriented. Highly qualified seniors would not put up with anything short of that. I know a highly qualified manager who volunteered to coordinate operations for an international aid organization. She loved the work and felt satisfied seeing the help it was providing BUT micro management from paid senior leadership was an obstruction and unacceptable and she quit. 

This is an all too familiar story. Fortunately for the active duty side (and others) there are leaders who learn, teach and practice leadership that works to efficiently accomplish mission goals while saving lives. Such leaders may be in the minority at the moment  so if you are active duty, seek out those leaders and study their strategies and tactics. If you feel stuck between micromanagers and bullies, deploy the real people and connection based leadership skills where ever you are able. Whether it‚Äôs at the squad or regiment and higher levels, you will see welcome bahavior changes. Do what works, document your progress and build liaisons with other like minded leaders regardless of their rank.

These comments pertain to all ranks and positions both military and civilian. People Skills based on functional empathic connection are fundamental to personal and collaborative missions.  Tragically without these skills bullying results and they then opt to the seemingly easy reaction of Obstruction. 

This heartless tactic has been used by dictators and their supporters throughout history to get what they want regardless of how it hurts others. As a retired teacher and former veterans counselor I suggest that part of the answer requires teaching such skills which I call Restorative Workplace Skills (Conflict Resolution, Goal Setting, Decision Making and Job Finding). These need to be taught in schools at all levels, in homes, churches and organizational structures military and civilian. I believe that people bully and choose hurtful behavior because they lack the skills to choose less hurtful behavior.

If there is an interest in dealing with bullies let me know.

Her mind blanked.
 She heard him saying Chloe's name in return, telling her how much he loved it, and was going to bang her again when they got home. 
She put her phone down on the counter, and felt tears slip down her cheeks.
 They‚Äôd been together for three years now, they had been talking about getting engaged just last week. 
At that moment she made a decision...

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Harmony
Harmony woke with her whole body aching, and her head was throbbing, she felt her stomach heave and knew she was going to throw up, rolled out of her bed and bolted for the bathroom, to vomit several times. She sagged down on the floor as she tried to recall what had happened last night.
She knew she‚Äôd gone out to that Christmas Party with her work friends, she‚Äôd wanted to celebrate Damien‚Äôs birthday with just the two of them, but the office had scheduled the Work Christmas Party on that very day. She‚Äôd been hoping to just spend an hour or two at the club, and then he and her would go and celebrate privately.
Harmony wondered where he was. She was home, but she couldn‚Äôt recall how she‚Äôd gotten there. Knew there had been cocktails and shots going around, she wasn‚Äôt much of a drinker, and Damien had encouraged her to have more, had told her he was happy to celebrate his birthday combined with the Christmas office party, seeing as most that he socialised with were there anyway.
She must have drunk more than she normally would, the night was kind of a blur of drinking, and then dancing and more drinking. She frowned, had an image of herself crying, she thought.
She shook that off and pushed herself up off the bathroom floor, she really had to learn to say no to Damien when he pushed drinks at her. This was not the first time he‚Äôd encouraged her to get blind drunk. Not the first time she‚Äôd woken up with no memory of the night either. She didn‚Äôt like that feeling of not recalling what she‚Äôd done, and had told him as much.
He‚Äôd just laugh and tell her 'you only live once you know.' Getting roaring drunk one or twice a year is fine. Though this was like the third time in as many months. She‚Äôd recalled telling him that she didn‚Äôt particularly want to drink. But it was his birthday, he told her, and it was time to let loose.
She recalled that he‚Äôd danced with her and handed her drink after drink until she couldn‚Äôt recall anything at all.
Harmony sighed and brushed her teeth, gargled with mouthwash, peeled her clothes off and realised she wasn‚Äôt wearing any underwear at all. Blinked at that, grabbed a towel and walked to her bedroom door, looked out there, no Damien. Shook her head, guess she would have to ask him what happened, but not until she‚Äôd showered and had coffee.
She did just that, showered and changed into loose-fitting jeans and a simple white tee-shirt that had snowflakes and mistletoe on it. She liked Christmas, all the happy people, they reminded her of her childhood home, with lots of laughter and fun around the Christmas tree.
She headed for her kitchen and found her handbag and keys there, along with her phone. Well, at least she didn‚Äôt lose them. She could see her phone was flashing at her to let her know she had a message. She picked it up as she put the kettle on to make coffee.
Accessed it and read the message under the play symbol. ‚ÄòJust in case you forgot what he did last night.‚Äô She frowned at that and wondered who had sent it. It wasn‚Äôt one of her friends, there was no caller ID, but it must have been something from last night; likely Damien had embarrassed himself and one of their friends thought it was funny.
Harmony clicked the play button and stared absolutely horrified at the sight of Damien having s*x with Chloe, one of the girls in their circle of friends. She stood and watched him pecking her and touching her all over before turning her around and bending her over to do her. Harmony heard Chloe calling out his name, and telling him he was the best, to give it to her, wanted it harder and to not stop. She heard him saying Chloe's name in return, telling her how much he loved it, and was going to f**k her again when they got home. She saw herself walk into the room and stare at the two of them.
She watched as Damien looked right at her, saw her see him cheating on her, but not pull himself from Chloe as she fled the room, just kept going uncaring, then there was nothing, it just cut off. She stared at the words below it ‚Äòjust in case you forgot what he did last night.‚Äô And she had forgotten, had absolutely no memory of that at all.
She put her phone down on the counter, and felt tears slip down her cheeks. They‚Äôd been together for three years now, they had been talking about getting engaged just last week. He‚Äôd been all smiles, and he‚Äôd been the one to bring it up and told her Christmas, New Years or Valentine's Day, there was a big surprise coming, and he chuckled and hugged her, teased her about not telling when he was going to propose, he would make it big and bold and surprise her. She wondered why he would do that? Bring it up if he was out there cheating on her?
Then she wondered just how she had gotten home? It would normally be Damien who brought her home, or back to his place, and he wasn't here. She had no recollection of anything, didn‚Äôt even know where her underwear was. Only that she‚Äôd not been wearing it at all. Her body ached like she‚Äôd had s*x, and a lot of it. She shuddered at the thought of not recalling. Had Damien brought her home and had s*x with her too?
She ran back to the bathroom and threw up again, and then just sat there and stared aimlessly at the wall, for who knew how long before getting up and making her way out to the kitchen once more. Stared at her phone for a long time and then walked away from it, couldn‚Äôt deal with it right now.
She walked to her lounge room and stopped and stared at the photo of her and Damien on the mantle. It was a picture of the two of them on their anniversary taken just two months ago. She stared at it as she saw that it had the words ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt forget to dump his hips.‚Äô And there was an X on the man‚Äôs face. She turned and looked around the room at the other pictures, and saw that there was big X‚Äôs on his face in all the pictures.",2,1736543602.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Date of Poss Exp: 1/8 early morning/night  
Type of exposure: otherSpecies: bat  
My Vax Status: unvaccinated

**My Health Dept official and Primary Care MD were conflicted about my risk, and I'm wondering if anything about my story can narrow it down and further inform my decision.**

I found a bat in my apartment yesterday morning, before lunch, resting at eye level on top of my fridge. I sent my kids (recently arrived from their mom's house; we are in a cold snap following a blizzard and school was closed) to their room, and caught the bat in a container while wearing work gloves. I made no contact with the bat, walked it downstairs, and released it outside.

I've lived in the building \~4 years, and once saw another bat in the hallway. I worked very late 1/7, and used the fridge multiple times that night and at least once the morning before I saw it. I slept in my bedroom that night with the door open.

I plan to have my girlfriend/partner check my body for any scratches or bite marks tomorrow. I never saw or heard the bat until I found it. I suspect it made its way in to get out of the cold. I was also gone from 7:45-10:30 that morning, picking up my kids and sledding.

When I called the health department I learned that I should've kept and euthanized the bat for testing with the state. They aren't concerned about my kids, since they didn't sleep there the night before (though the bat was in the same room with them when I found it), but were unsure about me, since I had.

I will admit I slept hard and with three alcoholic drinks in me the night before I found it, after a strenuous workday that ended with me at the office after midnight. I went to bed around 1:45, heard and felt nothing overnight, and was up by 7:15 in the morning. I would've grabbed a piece of ice from the freezer to throw in my coffee that morning, and have to imagine I'd have noticed it if it had come in by that time. But I would've been groggy too.

The health dept and my PCP think my risk of exposure is low, but because they can't rule it out, that I should think about getting a preventative vaccine. Per google and my vet (I also am keeping an eye on my cat now), rabies exists but is not super common in my area.

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs me. Call me back when you get this, okay? I‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ thinking about what you said, and I just need to talk to you.‚Äù

That was it. That was the last time I heard from Noah.

I replayed the message so many times I memorized every hesitation, every crack in his voice. I tried calling him back, of course, but his phone went straight to voicemail. I figured he needed space. Noah always did this when life got overwhelming‚Äîhe‚Äôd retreat for a day or two, hole up in his apartment with his records and a bottle of whiskey. But when a day stretched into a week, then two, I knew something was wrong.

I filed a missing person‚Äôs report. His friends hadn‚Äôt heard from him. His job said he stopped showing up after taking an extended leave of absence. His apartment was empty, the rent paid months in advance. It was like he‚Äôd just‚Ä¶ evaporated.

But I couldn‚Äôt let it go.

I went through every scrap of his life, tearing apart his social media, scrolling through our old texts, even digging into the corners of his past he‚Äôd been reluctant to share. There had to be something‚Äîa clue, a thread to pull.

And that‚Äôs when I found the notebook.



It was buried under a pile of papers in a drawer of his desk. The cover was plain black, the kind you‚Äôd find in any office supply store, but when I opened it, I realized it was a journal. And not just any journal‚Äîthis was his life.

Dates, places, people. Thoughts scrawled in his jagged handwriting. But the farther I read, the stranger it got. He wrote about shadows following him, about waking up in places he didn‚Äôt recognize, about a voice he could hear whispering his name at night.

‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre watching me,‚Äù one entry said. ‚ÄúI see them in the corner of my eye, but when I turn, they‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

Another: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going insane or if something‚Äôs really there, but it‚Äôs getting worse. I can‚Äôt trust anyone. Not even her.‚Äù

The date on that one was a week before he disappeared.

I reread that last line‚Äînot even her‚Äîover and over until the words blurred. Did he mean me?



I became obsessed. Every waking hour was consumed by Noah‚Äôs disappearance and the fragments he‚Äôd left behind. I found myself walking the places he wrote about in his journal: the coffee shop on 12th Street, the old bridge over the river, the abandoned lot behind the factory.

At first, it felt like I was retracing his steps, but then things started to‚Ä¶ shift.

It was subtle at first. My reflection in the mirror lingered a second too long. I‚Äôd hear footsteps when I was alone, soft and deliberate, like someone following me. Once, I caught a glimpse of something in my peripheral vision‚Äîa shadow, tall and thin‚Äîbut when I turned, there was nothing there.

The more I searched for Noah, the more I felt myself unraveling.

And then there were the dreams.

Every night, I‚Äôd find myself in a darkened version of somewhere familiar‚Äîmy apartment, my office, the park where Noah and I used to meet. The shadows were always there, standing in the distance, their heads tilted as if watching me. I‚Äôd wake up drenched in sweat, but the feeling of being watched wouldn‚Äôt go away.



Last night, I found the final entry in the notebook.

It was written on the back cover, the ink smudged and frantic, as if he‚Äôd written it in a hurry.

‚ÄúI understand now. They don‚Äôt want me. They want her. If you‚Äôre reading this, you have to stop. Don‚Äôt look for me. Don‚Äôt let them see you.‚Äù

My breath caught as I read it. My first instinct was to throw the notebook across the room, but I couldn‚Äôt let go of it.

I turned, feeling the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing against me, and there it was‚Äîjust outside the window. A shadow, impossibly tall, staring back at me through the glass.

I don‚Äôt know what they are or why they want me. All I know is that Noah disappeared trying to keep them away from me. And now that I‚Äôve been searching for him, I‚Äôve brought them closer.

They‚Äôre always watching now. I see them when I close my eyes, hear them whispering my name.

I thought I could find Noah. I thought I could save him.

But the more I search for him, the more I realize I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs disappearing.",12,1736543252.0,nosleep,4,0.88,False

1hyexmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hyexmh/help_me_justify_a_second_steam_deck/,Help me justify a second Steam Deck,"Ok so basically I bought a steam deck over a year ago now and it has become my main source of entertainment and I use it regularly, especially at the moment with it being winter and too cold to actually go outside and do anything. About a week ago I was playing on it and had it set up on my coffee table while using a controller, I also had a freshly brewed cup of tea sat in the table. My dog decided to charge past and knocked my tea over and as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve guessed it went all over my steam deck, things started to go a bit crazy with the deck where it had obviously gotten into the system so I turned it off instantly and left it to dry out, a couple of hours later once I thought it would have dried out I turned it on again but things were still going mad, like buttons being pressed so I turned it off again and considered my options.

I decided I would have a go at cleaning it as I‚Äôve taken apart small electronics before and I had seen people modding their decks so knew it was possible. I am however quite an impulsive person and decided just in case it was broken beyond repair I would order a new one as I had the money available, and I know from the past order that it can take a while for them to be shipped and arrive, I didn‚Äôt want to be without a steam deck any longer than necessary.

So a few days later I had my T6 screw driver and some isopropyl alcohol ready to attempt dismantling and cleaning, but before I did I tried turning it on again, and to my surprise everything was working again, no random button presses etc, so I‚Äôve decided not to open it if it‚Äôs not necessary. Meanwhile the new deck is being prepared for shipping, I did try to cancel my order but steam support told me my package had already been allocated so I would have to start a return once it was received.

My dilemma now is my old deck is working again currently, but I have a shiny new one on its way to me, I could simply start a return for it when it arrives, but it‚Äôs shiny and new and my old deck has now been tainted with teaüòÇ (as much as it is working). What if I return the new one and my current deck develops some kind of fault after? Plus the new one is shiny and new (not sure if I made that point enough üòÇ)

The money is spent and I‚Äôm not missing it so that‚Äôs not really an issue, I‚Äôm tempted to keep the new deck and sell the old one as second hand as it is fully functional and the second hand market value I think is justifiable as it is generally in very good condition, and that way I get to use the shiny new one. I‚Äôve also been considering just keeping the new one in storage in case my current one ever truly breaks beyond repair but that seems like a silly thing to do as I‚Äôd probably be upgrading to the next release whenever it comes out (yes I know it‚Äôs not rumoured to be for another year at least). The final option is to go through with the return and just keep using my current deck, if it does break in the future I‚Äôll just have to deal with that at the time ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Is there any justifiable reason to own a second stem deck that people can think of that might influence my decision?

TLDR: A cup of tea was spilled on my current steam deck and it appeared broken, I ordered a new one, in the meantime my old steam deck came back to life and now seems to be working fine. Can anyone give me a good excuse to keep the new one (other than its shiny and new) and not return it?",0,1736543062.0,SteamDeck,9,0.36,False

Hello! 

So, I am a heavy tea/coffee drinker in the winter. I usually plan my teeth cleanings around this (one in fall, one in spring). My last one was in October. 

When I switched to a new dentist, after each cleaning I felt like there was still discoloration and staining on my teeth afterwards. Both on the top and bottom teeth, with the bottom teeth having a center stain and white outline surrounding. Previously, I had went to my old dentist for a teeth cleaning and expressed concerns about staining (thinking it was enamel decay). He assured me that it was staining and that they would be able to take most of it off (using pressurized water?). That I know of, I did not receive any special treatment for this. 

I‚Äôve attached pictures for reference, both old photos when my old dentist removed the stains and what my teeth look like now (they have not changed much since last October cleaning). I am concerned that the staining is either permanent now, or my dentist is not adequately removing it as my old dentist was. 

Are there any options to help with this? I am starting to be very self conscious and smile less. ",0,1736542822.0,askdentists,1,0.5,False

[<$200],"Hi, I'm just getting into making my own coffee from home. I got a phin filter for Christmas because I love Vietnamese coffee with its almost dark chocolate taste, so I'm not doing espresso specifically (yet), but I do need more of a medium-fine grind. I don't have a lot of money, so if it's closer to $100, that would be great, but I definitely can't do more than $200. I have also tried going the manual grinder route (also a Christmas gift) and I just really don't like it. 

I've seen several recommendations like the Baratza Encore ESP or the Fellow Opus. But I also see cheaper ones by Kitchenaid or Oxo that I'm wondering if I could make due with since I don't need it fully espresso fine. At a minimum it should:

\- Work well enough for a decent cup and not break easily

\- Be relatively easy to maintain

\- Not be too messy

\- Not be too big

The last two are because I'm a college student still living with my parents, and I don't want to be making a mess of their counterspace. I appreciate any advice or recommendations üòä",1,1736542812.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The main idea is to push yourself to break away from things that artificially ""boost"" you, like unhealthy food, cigarettes, alcohol, or masturbation. In my case, the unhealthy habits that have always suppressed my emotions in some way were the internet, music, and to some extent, coffee. I‚Äôve tried other things, but only these were truly addictive to me because of how accessible they were.

I feel like if I hadn‚Äôt had these things around, I might have exploded long ago and taken my life in a completely different direction (not necessarily a better one). Or maybe, out of boredom, I would‚Äôve found other defense mechanisms (as a child, for instance, I loved reading, later drawing, or exercising, but now everything feels like an obligation). I used to desperately try to change, thinking these habits were the root of all my problems, but now I know it‚Äôs not entirely my fault. The way I am biologically (possibly autism and ADHD, not to mention diagnosed BPD along with CPTSD) and what happened to me makes everything much harder.

When there‚Äôs no music or any distractions, my brain and body entirely focus on how much I hate myself.

*THURSDAY*

Today is the day our truck delivers. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded and processed, so all of us weekday stockers are required to be here. No exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

By the time I get here, they're usually more than halfway through it all. But today, truck got here late... so looks like I'll be busy until close. Fine with me, I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today; almost excited to go to work. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work unloading and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. We call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they could give a shit less about what's going on around here. But on truck day, they'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they  come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as we can. We start with the dairy and frozen items, since they need to be stocked first. I'd already noticed Yogurt Lady waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I loaded Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday; old man just cant keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night though, so it's no big deal. 

""Move it, Elroy."" I say, kicking his shoulder as I pass. He just starts flailing around even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot. 

I took the milk, Chris took the eggs, and Paul got stuck with all the freezer items. He was pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the freezer is so hard to stock is because he'd been using it as a body storage, until it got too full. He made that mess, he can fucking deal with it.

Once I finish putting away everything on my cart, I look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's covered in egg juice, fighting with his extra hand trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him, and ask,

""Need a hand?""

He doesn't laugh, he just glares at me in defeat. I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

""Hey, thanks man!!"" Chris says.

Usually I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma snacking on a yogurt covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a clean up. When I put the receiver to my ear, it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over 10 minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By then, the floor is covered with raw egg/yogurt soup, and the Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished. We don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh,* maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8:00, because I noticed there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the openers get together and choose one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. The openers say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think they're all just sadistic. Or bored. Thank God they're all about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just shuffled in. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's the opposite. The bag is full when he comes in here, and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out... eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter, because I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

""Don't be mad..."" He says.¬† 

I already know. I reach into my bag, and pull out a handful of sardines. 

""God damnit, Lenny!""

I come back from break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out there. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen, of course, and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand had been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out the accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, then go looking for Paul. I found him in the freezer; he'd tripped over one of the bodies and knocked himself unconscious. Fucking idiot. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw out for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. I pass down aisle 13 on the way. The Spill That Never Dries is growing.¬† It's eaten the wet floor sign that was next to it; just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud, the coast is clear. I punch my number in, and the time clock hadn't stolen any of my time today. I smile triumphantly, turn around, and Paul is standing behind me; shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douche bag. I sigh. Maybe I'll call in tomorrow.",3,1736542450.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False

Wow, what a week, or should I say what a month, or even what a rolling 4-5 weeks. It has been hard, and this week pretty much only my bearish positions are green. Today, I could have should have would have doubled my money on short term puts again on RGTI, had I not fumbled the trade. Such is life of a trader with a screaming and hell raising toddler around. I still own the $7 puts which I believe will profit next week as RGTI is investigated and short sellers are circling it like vultures.

As for the rest of the trades, I made a few trades today on very speculative small caps where I have really tight stops and profit taking targets as well as 2 week time stops. These are risky plays but to me, the upside potential outweighed the downside risk, as they are beaten down and highly convex, i.e. pent up to the upside. More on this aspect of penny stocks in a write up over the weekend. One of them is pretending to me the next FFIE, and we all know how that ended, but before it ended in a carnage, the same accumulation scanner found it at 4 cents, and it went up nearly 100X from there.

1hyejzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1hyejzi/recovery_report_mountain_weekend_warrior/,"Recovery Report: Mountain Weekend Warrior, Bilateral Labral Repair","Hi everyone,

I wanted to make a post about my recovery from bilateral labral repair surgeries as a mediocre mountain athlete since I see a lot of posts with anxiety about how recovery will go, what to expect, etc. and experienced a lot of anxiety myself going into each of my surgeries. My experience is only one, but I thought it would be worth posting!

**A little about me**: I live in the mountains and I like mountain sports. I‚Äôm not particularly fast or strong, but I run, rock climb, I ski (both resort downhill and ski touring), and I hike a lot of steep terrain. I also bike if friends are going but it‚Äôs not a primary sport. I was training for a half marathon when my saga started. My left hip surgery was 7 years ago and my right was 18 months ago.¬†¬†

**What caused my tears**: I had pincer impingement on both my left and my right, and cam impingement on my left. I fell on some ice and caught myself weird, and that caused a large immediately symptomatic tear on my left side and a smaller tear on my right that didn‚Äôt become symptomatic until a few years after the repair on my left.¬†

**My symptoms:**

*Left side*: on my left side I had immediate groin pain and inflammation in my adductors‚Äìyou could feel knots through my skin along my adductors‚Äìand if I did too much with my hip flexor (running, hiking, etc), it would shut down and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to lift my leg. I also had deep pain that just felt wrong and wouldn‚Äôt go away.¬†

*Right side*: weirdly, this one started after a run on a treadmill with outside calf pain that wouldn‚Äôt go away. PT didn‚Äôt really help it until I asked if it could be related to a weakness in my hip. I had pain with all the impingement tests, and switching PT focus to my right hip helped for a while and then the tear just kind of decompensated. I ended up with really limited range of motion and weakness in stabilizing muscles.

**Path to surgery:**

*Left side*: I had just signed up for a travel half marathon when I slipped and fell in the early spring‚Äìbooked the flights, lodging, registration, whole thing. I went to a PT who worked on things for a few weeks, then recommended that I get imaging of my hip since the exercises weren‚Äôt making an impact. I started with my PCP, who got me x-rays and an MRI. They were both relatively clear, just some tendon inflammation, so I went back to the PT with those results and she recommended two orthopedic surgeons to talk to. I had appointments with both and picked the one who met with me, explained my imaging to me, and laid out a clear path forward: no additional imaging, cortisone injection to confirm the diagnosis, and surgery when I was ready. He also told me that he had no problems with me running the half marathon (the cortisone injection was scheduled to give me the best relief for the run) and to let pain guide me, and gave me a booklet of prehab exercises. I ran-walked the half marathon, hiked a lot of mountains, and generally tried to stay active. Gradually as the tear worsened I had to drop activities, but I got a good summer out of it, stayed really strong, and had surgery in the early fall.¬†

*Right side*: As soon as I realized that my hip was causing my leg issues and that I had pain reflective of FAI, I booked an appointment with a sports physician who had an early opening and got my x-rays and a referral for an MRA. I had also switched insurances and couldn‚Äôt see my previous surgeon, but booked an appointment for a week after my MRA with the hip preservation surgeon in my network. It took a few months to get in for the arthrogram, and I had that in the beginning of the summer and my appointment with my surgeon shortly after. The arthogram showed a tear and a paralabral cyst. I didn‚Äôt get a cortisone injection, and scheduled surgery for mid-summer as soon as I could get in. I found this side much more debilitating‚ÄìI had pain with sitting at certain angles, had significant range of motion limitations to the front so hiking was out of the question, and had much more muscle inflammation in my glute med and TFL. I still climbed to keep my sanity but stayed very low-level.¬†

**Recovery equipment, restrictions, living situations:**

*Left side*: I lived in a house that had a walkway with a few steps to the front door, and all of my living areas except for laundry were on the first floor with laundry in the basement. I was on both crutches for 2 weeks and was weaned off entirely by 3 weeks, and had bending and turning restrictions with a brace. I had a walk-in shower and used shower shoes just to make me feel like I wouldn‚Äôt slip in the shower. I had a grabber and relied on a lot of friends for help around the house. I also had a CPM and an ice machine. My parents were out to help for about the first week, and I could drive when I stopped the pain medications.¬†

*Right side*: I lived in a 3rd floor walk-up apartment. I was on two crutches for two weeks, one crutch for one week, and then weaned off entirely by four weeks. I had bending and turning restrictions with no brace, and had a CPM and the same ice machine that I had for my left hip. I used a bike desk to reduce the time I spent in the CPM. I also had a shower transfer chair to help with getting in and out of my shower/tub combo, a collapsible grabber, a tiny backpack to carry my stuff, and a crutch bag for my water bottle and food utensils. Sealing mugs were super-helpful to carry food or coffee around with my crutches. I was released to drive at 4 weeks, but my surgeon had told me to expect 4-6 weeks depending on how quickly my strength and reaction time came back.

**Post-surgery:**

*Left side*: I started with my surgeon‚Äôs in-house PT right after surgery, took one week off of work completely and worked remotely for a week after. I had a brace and toe-touch weight bearing for this one, and I took my pain meds for about a week and then stopped. Our company downsized not long after I returned and I lost my job, so had all the time in the world to focus on my hip recovery (when I wasn‚Äôt doing exercises, I watched a lot of TV, went on day trips with my boyfriend at the time, had friends come over to help with chores, and applied for a lot of jobs at a lot of coffee shops). I went to the gym to do my exercises and keep up a routine. As my PT approved, I started with my bodyweight PT exercises, then started incorporating biking and swimming, and finally running around month 3-4. I was skiing by January as long as I stayed on groomed runs, I climbed my first post-op 14,000 ft mountain in May, and completed my first sprint triathlon in the early fall. I had a tough time getting some piriformis irritation to calm down and had a massage therapist who was great at working on it while I worked on strengthening it. I also did a lot of foam rolling, a lot of yoga, and a lot of crying about why I was still in pain. I built a consistent enough running routine to succeed at the sprint tri but didn‚Äôt get back to the same volume I had before surgery.¬†

Importantly, three weeks in, I felt great, took my brace off, got into bed putting all my weight on my left knee and twisted my leg under me (like how I normally get into bed). Mega-pain. It went away with ice and gentle movement after a few days. My labrum is fine.¬†

*Right side*: I took two full weeks off of work, and had a remote job. I started with my in-network PT a few days after surgery, and I took pain meds for maybe 1-2 days after. I was off crutches completely by four weeks, and I went camping that weekend (flat campsite, goal was just to hang out, friends unpacked the things I needed from my car, and I slept on an air mattress inside my car that I could kind of slide onto from sitting instead of dealing with a tent). I was doing very very short flat hikes by 6 weeks, and did an 8 mile hike with 1500ft of elevation gain at about 10 weeks. I started back to running by sometime in month 3, and found this time to be slow going and really upset my SI joints (I was released from PT with a normal range of motion in my hip, but it was uneven with my left). I started with a sports specific therapist and made quick progress. With this hip, I had a lot more compensatory problems on my left side to unwind, and a lot more capsular tightness. The SI joint irritation caused a pretty big setback, but I found a lot of relief with water aerobics and aquajogging, and my newer PT helped me start actually lifting much heavier to make sure my big muscles were firing adequately.

Also importantly: 25 days post-op, there was a dog that I needed to pet and I did a full ass to grass squat very far past 90 degrees. I was sore. It went away with ice and gentle movement after a few days. My labrum is fine.¬†

**Where I‚Äôm at today**: I am about 18 months out from my right hip surgery. I have continuing tightness and a little bit of pain in my left hip from the compensatory patterns I developed in dealing with my right hip. I ski in the resort and in the backcountry, though I get a little bit of pain with my stabilizers. I am back to climbing 5.11 and working my favorite chimneys and corners. I‚Äôve gone on some brutal backpacking and hiking trips. I‚Äôm running roads and trails, and in the last few months I‚Äôve been rebuilding uphill strength. I‚Äôm just about to start training for my first pain-free half-marathon to close this chapter in a nice full circle moment.

**Recommendations**:

* If you‚Äôre having surgery, do your prehab. Get really, really, really strong before surgery, as much as you can. It will make post-op much easier. Also practice getting on and off the toilet one legged (I used my crutches to stabilize), going up and down stairs with crutches, using the shower transfer chair, getting into and out of the car and bed, and putting on pants with a grabber.¬†
* If you have hip pain and think it might be a labral tear, if you can self-refer for a PT, do it. It will get you stronger and you will be able to ‚Äúfail‚Äù PT more quickly if you do end up needing surgery, instead of waiting for a surgeon‚Äôs appointment and then starting PT. Also, in the event that you don‚Äôt need surgery, they are your best resource for resolving muscular pain that could be causing your symptoms or for conservative management of a labral tear. If you are thinking about surgery, they can also be a good resource to discuss pros and cons of the operation and get recommendations for surgeons‚Äìmine had a lot of opinions about who would be a good fit.¬†¬†
* Appointments with an orthopedic surgeon can be challenging to get. Primary care physicians or GPs can often get the ball rolling with an MR arthrogram and x-rays, though surgeons sometimes want their own. Facebook groups and Reddit threads can sometimes be helpful in figuring out if you should wait for the surgeon‚Äôs appointment to get their specific imaging.¬†
* For surgery, make things as easy as possible for yourself‚Äìmake sure your paths are clear for crutches, move things that are essential to reach up to between waist and shoulder height. I had small baskets for cleaning supplies on my kitchen and bathroom counters.¬†
* Ice machines are super helpful for controlling pain. Get 8-ounce water bottles and freeze those to act as ice cubes. Four bottles fit in my machine, so I got a pack of twelve and had 4 in the machine, 4 ready to go, and 4 freezing at any one time. It also made it much easier to change myself. I had the machine on a little end table, and then could put the bottles in my backpack and change them out; the water didn‚Äôt need changing.¬†
* Talk to your support network early. Early recovery, especially for my right hip, felt really isolating and it was difficult to make sure I had rides to PT, to post-op appointments, and to some social things. I worked with friends as much as I could to schedule things around their needs (early in the morning, late in the afternoon, etc.). Because I was vulnerable early, they also were more tuned to making sure that I had rides to fun things and making sure that I had help with laundry or food, or just being intentional about checking in on me and coming over to hang out.
* Try not to get in your head about being removed from your sport(s). Trust that you‚Äôll get back to it, and talk to your PT about your sport-specific goals. For my right hip, I picked out a few new hobbies to try that would keep me occupied, and found places with annoying parking that I could go (and take friends) with my handicap placard. As much as you can, still hang out with your sport buddies. I went to beers or dinner after my friends got done climbing/hiking/biking. I tagged along and sat in a camp chair at trailheads with a book while my friends hiked.
* Recovery isn't linear. You will most likely have setbacks and it can be a big mental slog with a lot of anxiety. A PT that you trust and have a good rapport with can be so helpful at negotiating the setbacks and all of the emotions that come with it. Go in with eyes open to the idea that this will be challenging and isolating, and start building what you might need to get through it. It goes both faster and slower than you think, and for me 4-8 months was the toughest time span each time.
* You will probably break your restrictions, and you will probably be fine. You will be anxious about it. Tell your PT, ice it, back off on movement and exercise (I went back to week 1 restrictions and movements both times), and give it a chance to calm down.¬†

I had gotten my first bottle when the company was BRAND new. Like not even on instagram ads yet, they had like 10-15 flavors maybe, before they dropped the first few coffee/latte cartridges.

I had lost that bottle so recently i bought a new one and once again im in love. The larger variety of flavors does overwhelm me just a bit because i dont remember what flavors i liked before since some of the packaging designs have changed.

Now heres why i come to reddit‚Ä¶

I bought a few flavors to try (for the first time basically) and one of them was the Blue magic Fission one. Upon opening both packages i noticed these weird spots on the cartridge. 

My question is, Are they still ok to use? Do i throw them out? What are the spots? 

Additional information:
Its only on the fission ones i have.
Ive never noticed the spots on any other cartridge ive ever bought.
They arent black spots so i dont think its mold but i could be wrong.
Its on the mouth piece and the part that goes into the water.
I also only bought the blue magic cartridges so im not sure if they are on the different flavors

1hyeg14,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsightVault/comments/1hyeg14/the_science_of_healing_and_consciousness/,The Science of Healing and Consciousness.,"**Music, Brainwaves, and the Path to Enlightenment: The Science of Healing and Consciousness**

Have you ever felt music hit your soul so deeply it seemed to carry you into another realm? You‚Äôre not alone. Across ancient shamanic traditions, music has been used as a vehicle‚Äîa way to dive into deeper spiritual realms, heal wounds (physical and emotional), and connect with the core of being. It‚Äôs no wonder they call it **‚Äúfood for the soul.‚Äù**

Even today, music is a tool for influencing our emotional state. **Fun fact**: humans are far more music-driven than they are visual-driven. Your eyes can be fooled with just 25 frames per second, but to trick your ears? You‚Äôll need thousands of audio samples per second. That‚Äôs why music has such a profound emotional pull‚Äîit‚Äôs built for depth and subtlety.

But music isn‚Äôt just for personal healing or entertainment. It‚Äôs being used as a form of behavioral control. In some bus stations and public places known for high crime rates, authorities pipe classical music through speakers. The result? Reduced violent behavior and fewer ‚Äúunruly types.‚Äù Beethoven for the win.

**The Role of Brain Waves**: The Science of Consciousness. 

Your consciousness is like a symphony, orchestrated by five types of brain waves, each playing a distinct role depending on your state of mind.

**1. Gamma Waves (40‚Äì100 Hz)**
- **What They Do**: The brain's ""supercharger"" for learning, memory, and information processing.
- **Too Much**: Anxiety, stress, over-arousal.
- **Too Little**: ADHD, depression, learning disabilities.
- **Optimal State**: Enhances senses, cognition, and memory. Also active during REM sleep.
- **How to Boost**: Meditation.

**2. Beta Waves (12‚Äì40 Hz)**
- **What They Do**: Keep you focused, alert, and on task.
- **Too Much**: Stress, anxiety, inability to relax.
- **Too Little**: ADHD, daydreaming, depression.
- **Optimal State**: Problem-solving, conscious focus, memory retention.
- **How to Boost**: Stimulants like coffee or energy drinks (but beware the jitters!).

**3. Alpha Waves (8‚Äì12 Hz)**
- **What They Do**: Help you relax and unwind. These waves kick in when you‚Äôre chilling but still awake.
- **Too Much**: Daydreaming, being too relaxed to focus.
- **Too Little**: Anxiety, insomnia, high stress.
- **Optimal State**: Deep relaxation and calmness.
- **How to Boost**: Relaxants like alcohol or marijuana (or natural methods, if you‚Äôre into that).

**4. Theta Waves (4‚Äì8 Hz)**
- **What They Do**: The gateway to creativity, intuition, and your subconscious mind. Think deep meditation or the state between wakefulness and sleep.
- **Too Much**: ADHD, depression, impulsivity.
- **Too Little**: Anxiety, stress, poor emotional awareness.
- **Optimal State**: Heightened intuition, vivid dreams, emotional healing, and creativity.
- **How to Boost**: Meditation, hypnosis, deep relaxation.

**5. Delta Waves (0‚Äì4 Hz)**
- **What They Do**: Found in deep sleep and young children, delta waves help your body and mind rejuvenate.
- **Too Much**: Brain fog, cognitive issues, learning problems.
- **Too Little**: Insomnia, poor recovery, fatigue.
- **Optimal State**: Restorative sleep, immune system healing, and natural recovery.
- **How to Boost**: Sleep aids or simply getting a good night‚Äôs sleep.

**Spotlight on Theta Waves**: The Realm of Creativity and Intuition

**Theta waves are special**. They‚Äôre the reason you feel deeply creative or experience bursts of inspiration during meditation or while daydreaming. In this state, your brain connects with subconscious memories, emotions, and intuition.

Some call it the **‚Äúflow state,‚Äù** where you‚Äôre simultaneously aware yet lost in deep thought. Advanced meditators spend a lot of time here, but even beginners can benefit from theta waves to:
- Reduce blood pressure.
- Enhance learning and memory processing.
- Tap into spiritual awareness or **‚Äúoneness.‚Äù**
- Heal emotional wounds and transform limiting beliefs.

**Why Does This Matter?**

By understanding brain waves, we can tap into the right frequency to boost productivity, relax, or heal. Pair that with the power of music, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for profound transformation. 

**Want to calm your mind?** Try classical music or meditation to boost your alpha or theta waves. 
**Feeling unmotivated?** Turn up your beta waves with coffee and an energetic playlist.

**Music and brain waves are tools for enlightenment, healing, and better living. Use them wisely, and you might just unlock the full potential of your mind.**

1hyee3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hyee3i/ten_years/,Ten years,"TLTR: Ten years-ago today, (1/10/15), I quit drinking thanks to this site. 

This post has been ten years in the making. Prior to this, my story was like many here. Years of alcohol abuse with many attempts at quitting. My periods of abstinence lasted anywhere from two days, two weeks, two months, two years, and a particularly good run of five-and-a-half years followed by an eight-and-a-half-year relapse. 

Like many others here, I came from an alcoholic‚Äôs home. I was on my own at sixteen after both parents died from alcohol-related diseases. I knew I was at a higher risk of alcohol abuse and promised myself I would not fall into the same trap. I managed to keep that promise through college. However, after obtaining my first post graduate job I fancied myself as being all grown up and surely able to handle a few drinks after work. You know the rest of the story. 

For the next decade, in my twenties and early thirties, weekend house parties, after work gatherings and other special events were ubiquitous. Given the opportunity, I tended to overindulge but somehow having the luck to not take it too far. That is not to say I did not make a fool of myself a few times, just did not do any physical damage or have any run-ins with the law. 

By this time, I was married, (no kids) to a woman who for some reason put up with this foolishness. However, I could see the disappointment in her each time she had to wake me up after passing out on the couch. The coolness in her demeanor when every restaurant choice or outing was based on availability of alcohol. The list became tiresome.

I did stop drinking a few times during this period, including a stint of two years. Each time I decided to start again, it was always with the idea that I had learned from the last time, and I had this in control. Within weeks of relapsing, I would be back to and surpassing my earlier levels of consumption. It was at this point that I started to deceive my wife. I would bring home the ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô six-pack and put it in the main fridge and out of that, drink two a night. Meanwhile, I would have several high alcohol content pints of IPA, and a bottle of wine secreted in my computer bag.

From the time I was a teenager I always stayed up late, turning in at around 2:00am. My wife on the other hand was usually in bed by 10:00pm as she had to go to work earlier, and this was just her nature. As a result, between 10:00pm and 2:00am I would hang-out in the basement TV room and get hammered.

Along with my preference for staying up late, I also had the ability to get by on four to five hours of sleep a night. This allowed me, after stumbling into bed at 2:00am to get up at 6:30am and be at work at 7:15am every fucking morning for forty-five years, but I digress. A big drawback of this plan was bottle management. Sneaking the alcohol in and the empties out was exhausting. Just like you rotate liquor stores for supply, I had trash dumpsters mapped out all over town for disposal.

Waking up every morning was terrifying. I had a mental checklist that I would process each morning. I‚Äôd reach over and check to see if my wife was still in bed, if she wasn‚Äôt it meant I was so drunk that I was making too much noise in bed, thrashing around or loud mumbling and she went to sleep on the couch. Second, I‚Äôd try to remember what happened the night before. Did I do anything at work while I was remoted in? Did I send anybody a text or email? What the fuck did I do on the internet? What did I do with the empties? Did I get rid of all the evidence? 

During this same time, I was doing surprisingly well in all other parts of my life. I quit smoking, took up healthy eating and started running to the point of completing two marathons and serval international running events. My career in IT skyrocketed, never slowing down. We built a house, traveled extensively, and had a really enjoyable time. I was fortunate for reasons I cannot explain to never have encountered serious repercussions from my drinking. No divorces, DUIs, suspensions or firings. And no run-ins with the law. To this day I cannot fathom my luck.

However, in my late forties I had an incident at work where I was outright betrayed by my boss. It had nothing to do with my performance but involved a dispute with HR where I would not hand over user log information when they did not have a policy that justified their request. I showed up with an attorney at my disciplinary hearing at which point HR said never-mind, and dropped the whole thing to run off and write a policy. This led me into an eighteen-month depression as my boss had made no attempt to back me, knowing I was right.

This depression resulted in me ceasing all physical activity, started smoking again, gained thirty pounds, and increased my alcohol consumption by double. At this point my preference was still for beer and wine. However, this was at the beginning of the craft beef craze; one of the hallmarks being its ridiculously high alcohol content. My sole criteria for choice of beer became its ABV content, wouldn‚Äôt bother with anything under 10%, usually going for something in the 11-14% range. Two or three pints of these would knock me on my ass.

Luckily at this point I got disgusted and fed up with myself. I saw myself becoming my father and knew how this was going to end. My depression was a result of this irrational hate I carried around for my boss and I finally realized I had to let it go. In April of 2001, I quit smoking and two weeks later quit drinking. One book that really helped me was Anne Fletcher‚Äôs Sober for Good. Its premise is that the author simply asks people who have quit for more than five years, ‚Äòhow and why did you do it?‚Äô  In most part their answers matched my motives and methods; I had enough, and I was just going to quit.

I was surprisingly successful. Something clicked. I went on a diet, loosing forty pounds in six months, trained for and ran my third marathon and made it through 9/11 without drinking. Icing on the cake, a year later my boss was fired for lying. I was offered his position, which I accepted but only on an interim basis as I was not interested in seating behind a desk and being stuck in meetings all day.

For five years, five months and two weeks I did not think of alcohol except to occasionally reflect on how good life was without it. I could not imagine it ever being a part of my life again, until it was. Just shy of my five- and half-year sober anniversary the idea returned that I got this. This resulted in an eight-and half-year relapse, culminating in plastic bottle vodka and day-drinking which closed out the last year and a half of this endless decline into an abyss.

At this time, I was within five years of a very lucrative retirement after a highly successful and long career. No one knew or at least I was never confronted about my drinking life. I could always rally myself enough to make it into work, seriously never missed a day, whether I was in any condition to be there was another case. I‚Äôd be the first one in, so I could get my coffee and bury myself in my keyboard and screen before the others showed up. Always promising myself this was going to change. I‚Äôll quit next week, yeah, next week it will be great, cannot wait‚Ä¶.. By noon, I would be fully recovered and feel good about my new resolve to quit. By 3:00pm I would be remembering what liquor store was in the rotation for tonight‚Äôs stop with great anticipation. Rinse and repeat.

But now my drinking had progressed to a level that I couldn‚Äôt believe I had allowed myself to obtain. I was experiencing physical pain and became very aware of where my liver was. I was at the literal finish-line, and I was putting everything at risk in the name of alcohol. I knew that this was non-sustainable, this had to stop, or I would be dead within five years.

On the weekend of January 10-11, 2015, my wife was going to visit a girlfriend for the weekend in an adjoining city. This of course meant I had the weekend to get wasted without guardrails. Problem was I decided to start early on Friday night. Like other times, my wife came down and found me passed out at 3:00am with a half-full glass of vodka next to me. The look of disappointment hit like a mortar. I knew I ruined her weekend. Instead of enjoying the city with a friend, she‚Äôd now be questioning everything.  She left in the morning without saying more than goodbye.  I of course proceeded to get wasted; the alcohol wasn‚Äôt going to drink itself.

Sometime on Sunday morning I woke up feeling like I‚Äôd never felt before, paranoid, nauseous, and extremely anxious. I realized later that I was having physical withdrawal symptoms, something that I had avoided all this time. I felt lost. I knew I had to quit. I knew I was killing myself.

I also knew I had been through this before which was both comforting and terrifying ‚Äì what if I failed again? I decided it didn‚Äôt matter; I had to try. Spent Sunday sober and in silence. My wife really wasn‚Äôt into talking after returning home. On Monday, I made it into work and started looking up local resources, even looked up location and times for AA meetings. Thanks to Google search, I saw a link to r/stopdrinking which led me to a site called Reddit, which I had never heard of before.

As soon as I started reading the postings I knew I found what I needed. I knew AA and even SMART wasn‚Äôt going to work for ME, emphases on me. What did and does work for me was listening to anonymous strangers going through the same damn thing I am and figuring out ways to reclaim themselves and their lives.

There is no magic at r/stopdrinking. Everyone here lays it out and understands you must do the hard work. Trying to imagine life without alcohol can seem insurmountable. And all we can do here is share what has worked for each of us.

What helped me was understating and visualizing that alcohol is a literal chemical poison. The rush of warmth you feel when it hits your gut is your body reacting to another five-alarm fire that is about to hit and affect every organ in your body in a detrimental way. There was no longer an awake moment when I was not consuming alcohol. My short sleep cycles were offering no time for recovery. Again, I was killing myself.

I would like to end with an ‚Äòeverything is great‚Äô supportive message, and I will, but not without a caution. It really is great, I am still alive. Being alcohol free these last ten years has been wonderful. I‚Äôve built trust back with my wife. I got to retire. Me and my family made it through Covid. We are fortunate to afford frequent travel and be involved in interesting projects around the house and community. Best of all, at 70 my wife and I are in great health ‚Äì completed two more marathons!

What is the caution? This shit never ends, you must stay on top of this. I have had a five- and half-year period of abstinence and then relapsed. Now after ten years of sobriety, I also know that it only takes one drink to turn this success on its ass. I know that if I were to drink again it would be the thing that kills me. I am running out of runway and do not have too many, (any) recovery cycles left so I cannot afford to screw this up. 

I check-in to r/stopdrinking often and will continue to do so. This site saves lives.

Thank-you

I drink a fair amount of coffee, averaging 2-3 cups a day.

I switched to sugar, just making sure it was about 1 tsp per cup, because at least that is a real food.

I know there is research recommending alternatives like stevia or monk fruit because those are real plants, but I truly can't stand the taste of any of those. They really ruin a cup of coffee for me. I know maple sugar and honey are also options but measuring a liquid 2-3 times every day is going to use up all my spoons really quickly and not something I know I can commit to doing regularly.

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm reaching out here because I‚Äôm looking for insight or shared experiences. Have any of you gone through what‚Äôs referred to as ‚Äúwalk away wife syndrome‚Äù when you decided to divorce your husband?

Here‚Äôs my situation: I‚Äôve been with my husband for almost 8 years and married for over 2. The last three years have been incredibly difficult. Things began to change after I caught him watching üåΩ in our spare bedroom while I was asleep. This crossed a boundary we had set in our relationship, and since then, intimacy has been nearly nonexistent.

We didn‚Äôt even consummate our marriage until a year after the wedding, when I told him I wanted a separation. He always said he didn‚Äôt want to risk pregnancy (we both don‚Äôt want kids), but he also refused to use condoms, get a vasectomy, or support me in getting my tubes removed. I had to be taken off bc because I was getting debilitating migraines that put me at a higher risk of having a stroke. 

Our relationship has since fallen into a routine where it feels like we‚Äôre best friends or roommates, not husband and wife. I‚Äôve tried everything to reignite our connection‚Äîinitiating intimacy, suggesting therapy (which he refuses), and being open about how I feel. He swears there‚Äôs no one else and says he‚Äôd be devastated if he lost me, but his actions don‚Äôt match his words.

He‚Äôs a great provider and spoils me, but I feel like it‚Äôs his way of compensating for the emotional and physical void in our marriage. I‚Äôm 33, and I‚Äôve reached a point where I just don‚Äôt want to try anymore. I‚Äôm emotionally detached and feel like we‚Äôre incompatible. I love to travel, but he doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm spontaneous, and he‚Äôs not. He no longer helps around the house, he stopped doing small thoughtful gestures like warming my towel in the winter or starting the shower for me, getting my coffee ready‚Äîthings he used to do.

I feel stuck in a life that doesn‚Äôt make me happy. I work remotely, earn significantly more than him, and have dreams I‚Äôve put on hold because he isn‚Äôt a risk-taker. I don‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life regretting the things I didn‚Äôt do, and I‚Äôve realized life is too short to live like this.

I know divorce will be hard on both of us, and I wish I had followed my intuition when I wanted to call off the wedding. I feel guilty, but I also know I can‚Äôt keep crying every day and living a life that feels so unfulfilled.

If you‚Äôve been through something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear how you navigated it. How did you find the courage to leave, and how did you handle the emotional fallout? Thank you so much for reading this‚ÄîI truly appreciate your time and thoughts.",1,1736541326.0,Marriage,8,0.6,False
1hye8do,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_InsidePersonality868/comments/1hye8do/why_did_friends_become_an_alltime_classic/,Why Did 'Friends' Become an All-Time Classic?,"https://preview.redd.it/1lkiy3q988ce1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=030fecaca0be8057499f85eb670ce477b0a5af17

When *Friends* first premiered in 1994, it instantly captured the hearts of millions. A sitcom about six twenty-somethings navigating life, love, and laughter in New York City struck a universal chord. Set primarily in a cozy coffee shop and two apartments, its seemingly simple premise became a cultural phenomenon that‚Äôs endured for three decades.

So, what made *Friends* so timeless? How did it redefine the sitcom genre, and why does it continue to resonate across generations and languages? Let‚Äôs dive into the magic behind the show that still makes us laugh, cry, and binge-watch like it‚Äôs the ‚Äô90s all over again.

**1. A Perfect Ensemble Cast**

At the heart of Friends‚Äô success was its chemistry-filled cast. Each character brought something unique to the table: Rachel‚Äôs charm, Ross‚Äôs quirks, Monica‚Äôs perfectionism, Chandler‚Äôs wit, Joey‚Äôs lovable cluelessness, and Phoebe‚Äôs eccentricity. Individually, they were memorable; together, they created magic.

**2. Relatable Themes with a Comic Twist**

The series explored universal themes‚Äîfriendship, heartbreak, career struggles‚Äîbut always with a dose of humor. Whether it was Ross yelling, ‚ÄúWe were on a break!‚Äù or Monica‚Äôs obsessive competitiveness, the characters‚Äô antics reflected our own flaws and insecurities, albeit exaggerated for comedic effect.

**3. Iconic Catchphrases and Pop Culture Impact**

Could *Friends* BE any more quotable? From Joey‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow you doin‚Äô?‚Äù to Phoebe‚Äôs ‚ÄúSmelly Cat,‚Äù the show gave us endless one-liners that are still part of pop culture. Even today, people find themselves debating Ross and Rachel‚Äôs relationship or re-enacting Monica‚Äôs turkey-head dance.

**4. Timeless Humor and Comfort Watching**

While *Friends* is undeniably a product of its time (hello, 1990s fashion), its humor transcends eras. The show‚Äôs blend of situational comedy, sharp writing, and physical gags makes it a comfort watch for audiences worldwide.

**5. Global Appeal and Longevity**

From its syndication success to dominating streaming platforms like Netflix, *Friends* has introduced itself to new generations. Its ability to make viewers feel like they‚Äôre part of the group‚Äîno matter where they are‚Äîhas made it a truly global phenomenon.

üé• In our [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3SZjj48fUk&t=92s), we unpack all of this and more:

She hasn‚Äôt said anything outright, but I‚Äôve got a feeling. Hear me out: we‚Äôve been seeing each other since December 2023. She‚Äôs six years older than me, and we both came out of dead bedrooms.

The first half of 2024 was incredible. We‚Äôd talk almost every day (except on weekends when we were home with our families).  We‚Äôd meet weekly for coffee or lunch, and every couple of weeks, we‚Äôd have sex. It was exciting‚Äîwe were always texting, sharing stuff, and making time for each other.   

But then things started to shift. Over the summer, she‚Äôd get upset when I couldn‚Äôt reply right away, especially when my kids or wife were around. Honestly, during those months, there wasn‚Äôt much private time, so keeping up with her was tough. I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, once the kids are back in school, we‚Äôll get back to normal.‚Äù But that‚Äôs when the dynamic really changed.

She started replying only once a day, sometimes not at all for days. I didn‚Äôt bring it up because she‚Äôd already told me in May how much it bothered her when I didn‚Äôt respond quickly. So I let it go and kept moving forward. But she started pulling away even more. Since July 2024, we‚Äôve only met up twice.

By the end of the year, I tried to reignite things. I sent her pictures and long messages, trying to get back to how we used to be. Her responses? Just a few words‚Äîno pictures, no effort, and no time to meet. I told myself, ‚ÄúShe must be busy. It‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

This week, we finally set up a date for today. I noticed she didn‚Äôt seem excited, but I had planned to tell her that if she needed space or time for herself, I‚Äôd understand‚Äîshe just needed to say so. But she canceled last minute and sent a short message: ‚ÄúWhat about next Friday?‚Äù I just said, ‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

This morning, we exchanged quick ‚Äúgood mornings.‚Äù I mentioned I was working from home today and that I was missing our chance to meet. That was at 7 a.m., and now‚Ä¶ nothing. This has become her norm lately.

Deep down, I think I already know we‚Äôre done. If that‚Äôs the case, all I can do is appreciate the time we had and find a way to move on, even though it hurts.",7,1736541012.0,adultery,18,0.82,False

I would like to have your opinions in order to put together a build which aim is to run recent games in 4K at 60FPS in ""the worst case"".

PSU: be quiet! Pure Power L8 Modular ATX 630W Power Supply 80 Plus Bronze certification  
Screen: BenQ ZOWIE XL2411P 24 inches, 144hz

I have already purchased a screen which will complete the new build which is the MAG 321UPX QD-OLED

My budget would be ‚Ç¨2500 (I could spend a little more if there is ever a good deal in terms of performance to be had).

I don't know yet if I'm going to change the case or keep the same one and I'm not tempted to spend more just for RGB on the components.

For the build I would only have one request, it is that it can be built around a 5080 (hoping that I manage to get my hands on one at launch)

Hey. I'm 18m and I've been having some trouble falling asleep while on my diet.

Normally I don't struggle with sleeping at all but since I've been on a diet, I've been running into all kinds of trouble.

I can't fall asleep at night. I know that feeling hungry is healthy and a normal part of losing weight, but the hunger pangs keep me awake. I can't take my mind off food for even a second, can't distract myself and can't concentrate on anything else.

Even on the rare days that I do fall asleep when I want to, I then oversleep massively. I've never been an early bird but I never struggled with getting up at 8 or 9. Now, on the weekends, any time before 1 or 2pm seems insanely early. Even when getting up at 2pm it takes me hours to reach a functioning state. I am so tired all the time.

Now even my old diet pal, black coffee has stopped keeping me awake.

The intense late night hunger is weird, I've never binged or been overweight before, I never thought that I had such an unhealthy eating habits.

I am pretty desperate, how do you people balance your diet with you sleep cycle.

1hye0v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hye0v2/first_crush_in_years/,First crush in years ,"There is a guy I have a crush on, my first crush in years. I've been single for the last 3 years, I have dated a lot. I am 30, he's 35. 
He works in the same building, for different company, and we are not professionaly involved. We had known each other for around 2 years before we started to talk.  First time we talked was after I came back from a two months vacation, and when he was passing me he noticed my absence, asked me where was etc. Since that day we have coffees together almost every day, we talk a lot, we flirt with each other. One day he proposed to give me a lift. We had a great time, listened to some music, when I arrived home I was just so excited that I immediately sent him a message if he wants to grab drinks as a thank you one day with his answer back ""just tell me when!"". Two days later I was chatting with a group of people, including him, about Christmas plans. All were having plans. He was the only saying he had no plans and he's gonna be alone. As my plans got ruined the last minute and I found it a perfect moment to ask him out, I waited until the two of us were alone and asked if he'd like to have dinner together to celebrate Christmas, as it seems like it's just the two of us without plans. He seemed happy, accepted my invitation, and we agreed on specifics. He was supposed to show up at my place at 9. He didn't. I called 9.30, he didn't pick up, so I sent him a message that I'm gonna pass on that evening. 10:30 he called that he is on his way to my house, he wants to apologize, and explain. I didn't want to meet him at first, but he insisted and I agreed to see him downstairs for a conversation. When he came, he said a friend of him visited him with his family unannounced, as they'd talked before that he's gonna be alone during Christmas. That was a good excuse, I appreciated that he came to talk face to face, but said that for me it's too late to have dinner now anyway, that maybe I gave him a wrong impression and that was not a booty call but a genuine dinner invitation, and he could have just called me. He said he didn't think about it as it was hectic, apologized many more times and asked how he could make it up for me, being all charming and talkative. I said I'm gonna just cut this conversation, and I'm going to bed, and I'll see him around. I wasn't being mad, I was being flirty, with a big smile, looking good, and I'm sure he thought he was going upstairs. Haven't seen him for the next two weeks as I was free. Two days ago met him for the first time, had a coffee together, none of us mentioned that situation. At first he seem to be distance, later we flirted, we laughed. There is just a spark between us! Yesterday the same. And today. But he still didn't ask me out... And I'm slowly getting tired of it. I see him wandering around my floor, he makes everything to make me laugh, flirting is so obvious, why wouldn't he ask me out? He is single, I asked him, after he asked me first. Normally I would just move on, but that guy... I don't know, I feel like I'm in highschool again with him. I laugh with him so much that I cry sometimes and he for sure does everything to keep me entertained. We had serious life talks. I see he is attracted to me and I'm very attracted to him. I would like to ask him out again but I think it would be too much me asking again if he was the one that bailed last time. He is supposed to step up. If he is not interested why would he act like he is. I probably should just forget about him, because if a man wanted to he would, right? But goddamn it is really my first crush in yeaaaars and I don't want to let it slide too easily. Feeling dumb to post it, but seriously, I thought the times when I can't stop thinking about a guy with a smile are over for me!

Thanks for all the congratulations!  
I meant to write a little message sooner, I've just been very lazy these last few days.

Wedding was great! Cool to meet up with all friends and families. Some I haven't seen for a long time as I've been away so much.  
Anna looked stunning! I'm definitely a happy man!  
The ceremony was kinda brief and in the pouring rain, we made our vows and then Steve Wilson played 'Something' by George Harrison. Per Wiberg (our session keyboard player) took care of the wedding march music. Pretty cool!

Then we had dinner inside the house (we got married in the garden of an old mansion). It was a Greek buffet and was very tasty! There were several speeches in our honour, which was nice. I never had a speech directed to me before. Jonas Renkse was the best man, and I was very psyched about his speech as I knew he was so fucking nervous about it. He did well though! The tables were named after metal bands...obviously, myself and Anna were at the 'Whitesnake' table!

Afterwards we cut the wedding cake, had coffee/scotch etc...  
One of Anna's friends made a dancing performance (some kind of sword-dance, middle eastern style, cool! Good music!)

Then it was time for the wedding waltz, and us trying to keep away a little from the traditional, we're dancing to a Monica Zetterlund track called 'Att ang√∂ra en brygga.' I ain't no dancer but I fucking got the rhythms! You know, 3/4 is my fave time sig when writing for Opeth!

And finally it was time for the partying. One of my friends was a DJ (Check out his sleaze band, Revolution Riot) and he played everything from ""Devil In Disguise' with Elvis to Slayer. I was dancing a little bit more with Anna to 'Crying In the Rain' by Whitesnake.  
People got drunk real fast!! I think most of 'em had a good time. Anna and me left just before midnight. A white stretch limo came to pick us up and drove us to the Grand Hotel. Sipping champagne and making out in the back seat, listening to....yes, Whitesnake!

We had the biggest suite reserved, the Sinatra Suite. Everything seemed cool, until I noticed that the whole suite was infested with spiders. Everywhere, big black spiders! It was like a scene out of 'Arachnophobia' or whatever it's called. We don't have any poisonous spiders in Sweden, but I don't fucking like them all the same. I reckon that there was around 40-50 spiders in the place. We had to change rooms after one made its way into the bed. Regardless, we had a blast!

Guests? Well, families and friends. Some people you might know about: Lee Barrett (got drunk and obscene, we had to throw him out!) Anders Nordin (ex-Opeth), the whole of Opeth, Katatonia minus bass player, Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree), Anders Friden (In Flames), Leif Edling (Candlemass), Stefan Dimle/Reine Fiske (Landberk, Paatos, Morte Macabre), Peppe Nordins (Anekdoten, Morte Macabre), Anna-Sofi Dahlberg (Anekdoten) Per Wiberg (Opeth, Spiritual Beggars etc.) I guess we had around 80 guests in total. From our childhood friends to new friends, it was pretty damn cool!

Well, well, back to chillin!'  
Take it eazzy!

Italy. The land of romance, breathtaking landscapes, and‚Ä¶ *caffe*?  While espresso reigns supreme across the country, Italy‚Äôs coffee culture is incredibly diverse, with regional variations showcasing unique brewing methods, bean types, and even names. This isn't just about the coffee itself; it's a reflection of local traditions and pride. So, grab your *tazzina* (espresso cup) and let's explore the delicious world of regional Italian coffee!


**Beyond the Espresso: A Regional Tour**

Forget the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach.  Italy's coffee experience is as varied as its beautiful regions. Let's dive into some of the most beloved variations:

* **Naples:**  Think strong, intense coffee.  Neapolitans cherish their *caff√® Napoli*, often a potent espresso with a slightly burnt flavour that some find bittersweetly alluring. Served quickly, it's more of a shot than a leisurely sip.  Don't expect fancy frills; it's all about the raw, bold espresso experience.

* **Rome:** Romans are known for their *caff√® romano*.  This is essentially an espresso with a generous splash of water, creating a more diluted, but still strong, beverage.  It's a classic choice for those who appreciate the richness of espresso without the intensity.  Many enjoy it as an elegant, easygoing morning pick-me-up.

* **Milan:**  The economic heart of Italy also boasts a distinctive coffee culture.  While espresso is still popular, Milanese coffee houses often serve *caff√® corretto*, an espresso ""corrected"" with a shot of grappa or other spirits. This warming blend is ideal for colder days and offers a unique flavour profile.


* **Turin:** The capital of Piedmont offers a distinct coffee experience, often opting for a *bicerin*. This layered drink combines espresso, chocolate, and whipped cream, offering a decadent and comforting treat.  It's a slower, richer experience than a simple espresso.


* **Florence:** Though espresso is ubiquitous, Florence showcases a more refined side of coffee culture. You might find a stronger focus on high-quality beans and a more deliberate brewing process.  The atmosphere is more sophisticated, with an emphasis on enjoying the coffee slowly rather than rushing through it.

**Tips for Ordering Coffee in Italy**

* **""Un caff√®,""** simply means ""a coffee,"" usually an espresso.
* **""Macchiato""**  adds a dollop of foamed milk.
* **""Cappuccino""** is enjoyed mostly in the morning, featuring espresso with steamed milk and a light layer of foam. Avoid ordering this after midday.
* **Be aware of size variations.**  What might seem small in one region could be large in another.  The best approach is to observe and ask questions!

**Embrace the Italian Coffee Culture**

More than just a beverage, Italian coffee is a ritual, a social experience.  Taking the time to appreciate the nuances of each regional variation adds another layer to your Italian adventure. So next time you find yourself in Italy, venture beyond the standard espresso and explore the rich tapestry of Italian coffee culture.  *Buon caff√®!* (Good coffee!)

Between constant notifications, endless conversations, and our own overthinking, silence feels almost alien. But what if silence wasn‚Äôt just an absence of noise, but a gateway to something deeper? That‚Äôs where Mauna, the practice of intentional silence, comes in.

So, What‚Äôs Mauna Exactly?

Mauna, an ancient spiritual practice from India, goes beyond simply not speaking. It‚Äôs about cultivating inner stillness‚Äîquieting the chatter in your head and reconnecting with yourself. Imagine a mental detox where your thoughts settle like ripples on a calm lake.

Why Silence Feels So Powerful

You‚Äôd be surprised how much we miss when we‚Äôre constantly talking or reacting. In silence, things shift:

You hear yourself think. You start to notice patterns in your mind, like insecurities or repetitive worries.

Your intuition grows louder. Without distractions, you tune into that inner voice guiding you.

You feel lighter. Letting go of the need to respond or explain is surprisingly freeing.


How to Try It Without Feeling Awkward

Mauna doesn‚Äôt mean going full-on monk mode right away. Start small:

Dedicate 30 minutes a day to silence. No talking, no phone, no distractions.

Try a ‚Äúsilent morning‚Äù once a week. Make your coffee, journal, go for a walk‚Äîbut skip the noise.

If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, look into silent retreats. Imagine days of pure peace and clarity.


Why It‚Äôs Worth It

In today‚Äôs chaotic world, silence feels almost rebellious. But it‚Äôs in that stillness where real growth happens. You might discover parts of yourself you didn‚Äôt even know were there. Plus, who wouldn‚Äôt want a break from the noise once in a while?",8,1736540509.0,enlightenment,10,1.0,False

I‚Äôve acquired some jopo seeds and want to consume them in a sort of drink. The plan is to roast the seeds and then grind them, and finally use a coffee filter to make a brew. The problem is that I can‚Äôt find much information on dosing. I know that the seeds contain DMT, bufofenin, bufotenin, 5-MeO-DMT, and some other psychoactive substances, which is why I‚Äôm interested in this to begin with. 

For a bit more relevant information, I recently did my own psilohuasca brew that absolutely purged me of the worst of my mind through the most horrifying experience I believe I‚Äôll ever have. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ready for a night that that one again, and would sort of prefer a nice ‚Äútourism‚Äù experience where I get an intense psychedelic journey where I can observe the world from that perspective or even to break through (which I‚Äôve never dome before), just not where I experience extreme levels of suffering before being completely relieved of it. Anyways, I still have Syrian rue leftover from that so would it make sense to use that MAOi in this case, since I‚Äôd be consuming N,N-Dimethyltryptamine orally? How much should I use if so? I‚Äôve never done DMT before, just psilocybin/psilocin.

Also, has anyone else had a similar experience on aya/psilo/pharma-huasca? Could I make another aya-esque potion using these seeds? And what about cultivation of the seeds just as a gardening experience?

Thanks for reading and much love to all. Stay present.

I, clearly FOOLISHLY, thought I might save a bit of money on coffee, so I instead ordered a pot of tea which I FOOLISHLY believed would cost the same price it has cost me the past dozen times I ordered it -- an average $2.50 before tip. Fool that I am.

After only waiting on service for a mere twenty minutes, a rush job in Kramers time, things were looking shakey. Since I'm only ordering a drink, I'm asked to move from my table to the bar or a chair. I move to a lounge chair, but someone else's plate is on the lamp stand, so I'm told I'm allowed to move back to my table. Joy.

I receive my green tea (nearly hot) in a new red teapot with a miniature hour glass placed next to it. *How cute!* I think to myself. Finally, Kramer's is working to improve the customer experience. And to top it off, a teacup without without any stains from the last drink still in it! What a treat.

The tea is middling, but it is randomly looseleaf, which is nice I guess. After not being checked on for an hour, I rise to pay and am informed of the news. For some godforsaken reason, my tea is now $13.50 (after tip). But really it's my fault for not claivoyantly knowing there would be a $10 price jump on their cheapest menu item. Why bother mentioning that when you know you didn't hand the customer a menu?

  
Really though, the kicker is that I'm going to keep going back... so in the end it actually IS my fault :/ Despite little incidents like this, Kramer's can still be a coffee shop money saver, because sometimes they just never come over to serve you at all.

This makes me completely reliant on my husband and I have to take his word for it...


My husband and I moved countries due to some personal reasons and also wanting to be closer to his family as I was pregnant. We were supposed to rent a really nice flat, however it turned out that the current tenants would still be in that flat for another couple weeks. He then decided, given that I was pregnant and due in 2 months time to move to my MIL's place so we would save money and I would get help with the newborn. I first didn't think anything of it as she seems generally pleasant and nice and assumed that it would only be a month or so we would be staying with her, max until after birth. Well 1 month now turned into 4. I am tired of staying here, the house we are staying in is big but I cannot go upstairs to the dining/kitchen area unless I want to be bombarded with a monologue not to mention her always wanting to take my newborn and cuddle him. It's also always the same topics she talks about and how much she bought xyz at the supermarket for and her ex husband and my BILs business etc (she doesn't work). She spends all her days upstairs and can just not leave me have a coffee in peace and quiet without barraging me with conversation (she just rattles off every thought that comes into her head). I just want to be able to go up in the morning and drink a coffee while looking out of the window but that is impossible. I've already told my husband I want to move but the flat we were going to move into isn't free for another 2 months. I feel like I just hold in rage every day and get more angry as I feel so cooped up in our room. There are other things she is peculiar about (immediately washing dishes after usage) but I can largely ignore those. I just wanted to vent tbh, it's almost over but to anybody who is being currently convinced by their partner to move in with the in laws... Just don't unless you have no other option. Getting along at a distance is one thing. Living together is another. It's not your mother/parents and you will not be able to be candid with them, which will just create resentment ( it did for me .

My husband (36M) and I have been together for three years, and we now have a 6-month-old baby. What should've been a joyful time has turned into something I never imagined for myself. The issues started around the fifth month of my pregnancy.
One morning, I didn't hear his alarm and didn't wake up to make his coffee for work. He came into the bedroom, grabbed me by the chest of my shirt, and screamed in my face. It completely shook me, but by the time he got home from work that evening, we had ""made up."" I brushed it off, thinking it was a one-time outburst.
But things escalated. Over time, the emotional abuse turned physical. He started hitting me‚Äî slaps to my face, punches to my chest, and throwing me around until my body was bruised. I remember one incident, clear as day, that still haunts me. I was about two weeks postpartum, exhausted and vulnerable. He got drunk and punched me in the face before kicking me while I was on the ground.
After each incident, he always comes back crying, saying he feels like something is ""taking over his body,"" begging for forgiveness. He promises it won't happen again, and for some reason, I keep hoping he'll change. But deep down, I know I need to leave. I don't feel safe, and I'm terrified of what this environment might do to my child if I stay.

The problem is, I don't know how to leave. I don't have any money of my own or family nearby to turn to. I feel trapped, and I don't even know where to start.
Any advice or guidance would mean so much right now.
 

Additional context regarding my babies safety: Although he never directly showed aggression toward our baby, he used her to manipulate me and put me in a vulnerable position. I remember i broke away from his grip and I ran and hid under the bed, but soon after, I heard our baby scream. I immediately rushed out, but before I could reach her, he hit me with a fist right to the forehead. I wasn't sure if he had hurt her to make her cry, but I knew I had to get to her.

We‚Äôve Got You Covered!,"üåê Introducing **ObfusTech's PATTERN SCRAMBLER‚Ñ¢ 3000** ‚Äì the only wearable device GUARANTEED\* to confuse surveillance algorithms, nosy anomaly trackers, and overzealous data harvesters!

üí• **How Does It Work?**

* **Active Signal Misdirection:** Sends out randomized metadata to make YOU look like a thousand people in a thousand places.
* **Adaptive Broadcast Camouflage:** Masks your signal with harmless feeds like cat videos, cooking tutorials, or reruns of *The Signal Hour.*
* **Quantum Vibration Shield‚Ñ¢:** Prevents drones and scanners from picking up your biometric data.

üï∂Ô∏è It‚Äôs sleek. It‚Äôs stylish. It‚Äôs the ultimate **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Track Me, Bro‚Äù** accessory for paranoid signal hunters and anomaly deniers alike!

‚ú® **NEW FEATURE:** Feeling petty? Flip the switch to send *fake anomalies* directly to trackers. Drive them crazy chasing ghosts while you sip your synth-coffee in peace.

üí¨ What Our Satisfied Customers Say:

* ‚ÄúNow, I can walk down the street without the Paradox Protocol lighting up like a fireworks show!‚Äù
* ‚Äú10/10, haven‚Äôt been flagged as ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô in weeks.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFinally, I can be invisible like the anomalies I‚Äôm supposed to track.‚Äù

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** ObfusTech is not responsible for any accidental disruptions to the Broadcast Paradox network. Use at your own risk. And seriously, don‚Äôt use it in an anomaly zone unless you *really* like chaos.

üì° Order now and get a free pack of Signal Dampening Stickers ‚Äì perfect for your gear, your coffee mug, or your forehead. Because nothing says ""LEAVE ME ALONE"" like a literal anti-surveillance bumper sticker.

üîó **Act Fast! Supplies are limited (thanks to constant raids by shadow ops, probably).**

üéØ **ObfusTech PATTERN SCRAMBLER‚Ñ¢ 3000 ‚Äì Your Anonymity, Amplified.**

*Guarantee applies only in areas outside the Broadcast Paradox's primary tracking zones. Results may vary. Side effects include digital vertigo, existential dread, and an unhealthy distrust of toaster ovens.*",1,1736539858.0,BroadcastParadox,0,1.0,False
