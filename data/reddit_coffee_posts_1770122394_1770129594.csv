There was so many dishes even after I tossed what I decided wasn't saveable I felt like I didn't know where to start, a feeling I often get when trying to dehoard

  
So I started making up rules for what to wash next, at nearly random just whatever popped in my head to wash

  
""Well, I have to clean all the utensils first, thats the rule/policy afterall""

  
""well the surving spoons and spatulas are similar thats why the rule is to wash them next""

  
these rules should be made up and broken on the fly, their intention isn't to actually logically solve the situation but to give you a feeling of structure to help you keep chipping through the mess

  
example of breaking a rule, while washing all the coffee mugs I decided randomly to grab a glass measuring cup and wash it in the middle of doing the mugs. Who is gonna report me for breaking my own rule while Im alone in the kitchen? No one can stop me!

1qutkgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qutkgf/the_psychology_of_becoming_dangerously/,The Psychology of Becoming Dangerously Knowledgeable: what schools never taught you,"Most people think being ""well-read"" means finishing a book per month or listening to podcasts during their commute. That's cute. But here's what I've noticed after spending ungodly hours researching this: genuinely knowledgeable people don't just consume information, they architect it. They build systems that make learning so automatic it becomes unfair.

I've pulled insights from cognitive science research, interviewed learning strategists, binged neuroscience podcasts, and tested methods that made me question why schools never taught us how to actually learn. This isn't about becoming a trivia champion. It's about developing such a dense knowledge web that you start connecting dots nobody else sees.

**The brutal truth about knowledge acquisition**

Your brain isn't designed for modern information overload. We're wired for survival, not synthesizing 47 browser tabs. According to research from Barbara Oakley's work on learning science, most people operate in ""diffuse mode"" (passive scrolling) rather than ""focused mode"" (active processing). That's why you can watch 100 YouTube videos and retain basically nothing.

Real knowledge building requires what Cal Newport calls ""deep work"" sessions. I'm talking distraction-free, phone-in-another-room, intense focus blocks. Start with 25 minutes if you're a beginner. Your brain will literally rewire itself to handle longer sessions over time. Neuroplasticity is real and it's YOUR advantage.

**Build a second brain before your first one explodes**

Stop hoarding information like a digital hoarder. Tiago Forte's book ""Building a Second Brain"" changed how I process everything. The dude worked with productivity researchers and Fortune 500 companies to develop the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). It's insanely practical.

The concept is simple but nuclear: your brain is for having ideas, not storing them. Every insight, article, quote, or random shower thought goes into an external system. I use Notion but Obsidian works too. The magic happens when you start linking notes together. Suddenly you're seeing connections between stoicism, behavioral economics, and your dating life that nobody else catches.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about note-taking. Forte synthesizes cognitive science with real world application in a way that feels almost unfair. After reading it, consuming information without processing it felt like driving a Ferrari in first gear.

**Learn through active reconstruction, not passive absorption**

Here's where most people fuck up: they think reading equals learning. Wrong. According to retrieval practice research (backed by cognitive psychologists like Henry Roediger), your brain only REALLY learns when it struggles to recall information.

The Feynman Technique is your weapon here. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, it's stupidly effective: explain concepts in simple terms like you're teaching a kid. If you can't, you don't understand it yet. I do this by literally talking out loud (yes, I look unhinged) or writing explanations without looking at sources.

Also, space your learning. The forgetting curve is real. Review material at increasing intervals: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days. Apps like Anki automate this using spaced repetition algorithms. I use it for everything from vocabulary to business frameworks to philosophical concepts.

**Consume knowledge from wildly different domains**

The most dangerous thinkers aren't specialists, they're ""[range](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)"" thinkers. David Epstein's book ""Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World"" absolutely demolished the ""10,000 hours in one thing"" myth. Epstein studied athletes, musicians, and Nobel Prize winners and found that exposure to multiple fields creates cognitive flexibility that specialists can't match.

This is backed by research on analogical thinking. When you understand game theory AND human psychology AND evolutionary biology, you start seeing patterns everywhere. Your brain becomes this insane pattern recognition machine.

I rotate between reading business books, philosophy, neuroscience, history, and fiction. The combinations create insights that seem almost prophetic. When you understand both Stoicism and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, you realize they're basically the same framework dressed differently.

**Make learning social and teach others**

Knowledge trapped in your head is worthless. According to learning retention research, we remember about 10% of what we read but 90% of what we teach. Start a blog, make YouTube videos, or just explain concepts to friends who pretend to care.

I started writing short summaries of every book I read and posting them online. The accountability and forced articulation 10x'd my retention. Plus people started asking questions that pushed my understanding deeper.

Join communities where knowledge exchange is the culture. Reddit has incredible niche subreddits. Discord servers for specific interests are gold. Finding even one person as obsessed as you creates accountability that YouTube algorithm can't provide.

**Curate your information diet like your life depends on it**

Most content is junk food for your brain. Colorful, addictive, and leaving you stupider. I'm ruthless now: if something doesn't teach me a new mental model or challenge my thinking within 5 minutes, I'm out.

Subscribe to quality newsletters like [Farnam Street](https://m.youtube.com/@farnamstreet3661/about) (Shane Parrish breaks down mental models beautifully), listen to podcasts like Huberman Lab for neuroscience deep dives, or Lex Fridman for long form conversations with actual experts not influencers.

For a more structured approach to learning, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app built by former Google engineers that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. What's useful about it is the adaptive learning plan, you type in something specific like 'I want to build a broader knowledge base across multiple domains' and it generates a structured plan with content tailored to your pace and interests. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really hooks you. It also has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with to explore ideas further or get book recommendations based on what you're working on. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes dense material way more engaging during commutes or gym sessions.

**Build learning into your existing routine**

You don't need 4 extra hours per day. Exploit dead time aggressively. Audiobooks during commutes, podcasts while cooking, educational YouTube during meals (I know, I know, but we're being practical here).

I keep a running list of ""learning sessions"" on my phone. Waiting for coffee? Read 2 pages. Bathroom break? Review 5 Anki cards. These micro sessions compound into dozens of hours monthly.

Also, change your default behavior. Instead of opening Instagram when bored, open your reader app. Delete social media from your phone's home screen and replace it with Kindle, Pocket, or your note taking app. Environment design beats willpower every time.

**The uncomfortable part nobody mentions**

Getting dangerously knowledgeable means accepting you'll never know enough. The more you learn, the more you realize how vast your ignorance is. That feeling doesn't go away, you just get comfortable swimming in uncertainty.

You'll also become harder to talk to at parties. People don't always want to discuss epistemology over beers. You'll notice how shallow most conversations are. How confidently people speak about topics they've spent 10 minutes understanding. That's the trade off.

But here's what you gain: you become significantly harder to manipulate. You spot logical fallacies in real time. You make better decisions because you're drawing from broader knowledge bases. You become the person others come to for insight. That asymmetry is genuine power.

The gap between someone who learns systematically and someone who doesn't compounds daily. Six months of applying these principles and you'll barely recognize your previous thinking. Start now, your future self is already grateful.

By Devlin Eggson

*Special to The New York Times*

[Dotty’s Spotty Spoon in Smithfield, Pennsylvania is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. Most leopards begin hunting at dusk.](https://preview.redd.it/f6cc0vxpiahg1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74063f42feaf22c3578beb5c15b7c367aa661bca)

Dotty’s Spotty Spoon diner on the corner of Summit Street in Smithfield, Pennsylvania is a long way from Washington D.C. So as flatware clattered on formica and longtime patrons limped to their booths for a late lunch on one recent afternoon, the conversation wasn’t about Senate budget negotiations: It about the new pastor at First Lutheran, the speed trap on Route 119 and the best way to stop the bleeding from a severed jugular. 

But when the topic did drift to politics, locals would flash a laboriously reconstructed smile and say that despite the headlines, they still stand behind the leopards that have eaten, and are continuing to eat, their faces.

“I may not agree with all the leopards’ decisions about whose face to eat and whatnot, but I can still see all the great things that they’re doing for America,” said Dale Stelnik, 68, a retired plastic salesman who has been blind since last September when a 75-pound female African leopard punctured both his eyeballs. 

For decades, Smithfield and surrounding Fayette County had been a stronghold of blue-collar Democrats, but in 2016 and again in 2024, voters here swung hard for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party. 

Voters then and now cited the economy and cost-of-living as their top concern. And on that score, many said that the leopards have delivered.

“Egg prices used to be out of control,” said administrative assistant Jane Foley, 33, through a tracheotomy stoma. “But now that I’m not eating solid foods anymore, my grocery bills have gotten a lot lower.” 

In the Spring, Federal budget cuts forced the town’s biggest employer, the SedateTech tranquilizer gun factory, to shut down. 247 employees lost their jobs. Local tourism has also slowed since summer, when leopards began dropping onto hikers from trees in nearby Ohiopyle State Park. 

But as their coffees are refilled, diners who can speak above a whisper are quick to point out the upside: The emergency room at Uniontown Hospital has tripled in size, and Keenan’s Funeral Home on Highland Street has an eight-month waiting list. 

Dotty Spentach, 42, owner of the Spotty Spoon, says that it’s too soon to judge what the new administration will mean for her business. In October the county shut her down for three days when her fry cooks’ open wounds kept oozing into the hollandaise. On the other hand, she’s hired two new waitresses to spoonfeed customers who no longer have hands.

The changes have been felt in every part of town. Coaches at Albert Gallatin High School get to go home a little earlier now that track and field practices have been cancelled, part of the Department of Education’s new Stop Running initiative. And in a part of the state where 74% of residents are classified as overweight or obese, the Pennsylvania Department of Health has reported that facial weight is down 22% in just six months.

[Local wildlife biologists say leopards can smell voters from a half a mile away.](https://preview.redd.it/1tygh1puiahg1.jpeg?width=5488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0b4fcec1d324823dc6cd6ac4298f4c639360765)

Most in Smithfield have seen the memes and giddy Youtube songs about leopards eating their faces. But at table 12, by the window overlooking the VFW parking lot, those memes just don’t ring true.

“Leopards didn’t eat my face,” said Dan Miller, 37, an HVAC technician, as he sipped Diet Coke. He pointed at his face. “This here was a mountain lion, or maybe a puma.” As Miller chuckled dismissively at the ignorance of faraway comments sections, Diet Coke dribbled through his perforated left cheek, down past where his lower lip used to be, and onto his partial chin.

Despite the local optimism, questions about some new federal policies have begun to emerge. During the election, strict immigration enforcement was one of the leopards’ best polling issues. So it came as a surprise to some in Smithfield when the State Department resettled 12 breeding pairs of Indian Leopards here just before mating season.

“It doesn’t make sense to me,” said 55 year-old account manager Lily Santiolo. “So are all these new immigrants going on welfare now? What on earth do these leopards think they’re going to eat here?”

Others have found themselves thinking that the issues may not be black and white. 

Mopping up the last of his yolk with a piece of toast, Phil Herman, 46, said that he had been drawn to the Leopards Eating Peoples’ Faces Party because of their strong stance against what he calls “all that transgender nonsense.”

“But ever since that leopard ripped my genitals to ribbons and drooled what was left of my urethra back into my open abdominal cavity, I sometimes find myself wondering – geez, which bathroom should I be using?” Still, Herman added, he believes that the leopards understand these complicated issues and whatever decisions they make will be the right ones.

The February sun was setting over the Alleghany foothills. Back at Table 12, Dan Miller had finished his Diet Coke with the help of a few napkins, and was sharing his thoughts on foreign policy.

“I think other countries, when they see how we just let wild animals tear off our faces and don’t make a big deal about it, they’ll realize how tough we are and they won’t mess with —”

Just then Miller glanced out the window and froze. A male Arabian leopard, glowing golden in the waning light, was sauntering down the center line of Summit Street. He was 150 pounds at least. After stretching his front legs, then his back, the leopard padded over to the sidewalk, laid down directly across from the diner, and began to wait.

As the dining room fell silent and the remaining Spotty Spoon patrons noticed, one after the other, who was outside, they all instinctively knew something that progressive activists and Democratic politicians have often struggled to understand. You probably can’t outrun a leopard that’s capable of 36 mile-per-hour bursts. But if you start back to your car right now, you just might be able to outrun everyone else in the diner, especially the ones in wheelchairs.

And so, with the hurried slamming of crumpled bills on tables and the squeak of sneakers on linoleum, another day in the heartland drew to a close.

1qutgff,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1qutgff/i22_male_she22_female/,I(22 male) She(22 female),"Three months ago, I was waiting for a training event to start while drinking coffee at a table. After a while, some other people joined the table and we started chatting. Then a girl came and joined us. We talked together as a group for a while, and when the event started, everyone went to their seats.

After the event ended, I was talking with people from my team when I noticed her. She came over to me and we started talking. She invited me outside to smoke with the group I had first met at the table. Later, we walked towards the metro because we were going to take different buses, so we separated from the group and continued talking on our way to the bus stops. Then she asked if I wanted to drink something. I said yes, and we went for coffee. We talked for a long time, and it was really enjoyable.

When it was time to take our buses, I told her that I was happy to meet her as I was getting on the bus. As I was about to leave, she asked for my Instagram, and I gave it to her. We talked for about a week, and then she asked for my phone number. After that, she wanted to meet again, so we did. It was very pleasant for both of us. When I got home, she messaged me saying that it had been a really beautiful day and that she felt very good being with me. I told her that I felt the same.

We kept talking and meeting after that. Our dates were going really well. I was enjoying them a lot, and I could tell that she was too. After every meeting, I walked her home, and we would stand in front of her building talking until late at night. We talked for long hours, went out, had dinner together, and once I bought her a small gift, which she said she really liked.

Everything was going like this, but after a while, I started to feel as if there was some kind of emotional distance between us when we were apart. I was constantly thinking about her, and I had become very attached in just one month. One day, I texted her saying that I liked her a lot but that I didn’t feel she felt the same way about me, and that if she didn’t want to continue, we could stop talking.

She called me immediately after that. She said it wasn’t like that and told me that she had had a bad relationship in the past — a long one that lasted two years. She said she had an avoidant attachment style. She got very emotional during the call and was even crying. I told her that I didn’t want to hurt her and apologized, and she apologized too. After that, we continued meeting as before.

Later, during the midterm break, she went back to her hometown. We met three days before she left, and everything was great again; we were having a really good time. On the evening she was leaving, I went with her to the bus station to see her off, and she really liked that. After she left, we kept talking every day. We texted constantly and talked on the phone every couple of days. Everything seemed fine, but after some time, I started to feel that same sense of distance again. I thought about texting her about it, but I gave up because I didn’t want to ruin anything.

Then I stopped texting her for a few days because I was curious whether she would write to me. After about two days, she did, and we talked again. Everything seemed normal. One evening, I told her that I wanted to call her. She said she wasn’t feeling well and that she had experienced something like a panic attack. I suggested that we talk because it might help her feel better, but she didn’t want to.

Two days later, we were texting in the evening and she called me. She sounded low in mood. Then she told me that she wanted to say something. She said that she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I said okay. Honestly, I was shocked. I was kind of expecting something like that, but when it actually happened, it hurt. I couldn’t say much, I just said “okay.” She told me that I was a very good person, that she didn’t feel ready for a relationship, that she didn’t want to make someone else go through what she had experienced, and that I was thoughtful and kind. She said that if she were to be in a relationship, she would want it to be with me. But I didn’t say anything; it was like I was speechless. I told her to take care of herself and was about to hang up. She started saying things like “Should we stay friends?” and I hung up the phone.

Now the problem is that I think I put this girl at the center of my life too much in just two months, and the fact that it ended halfway has really worn me out. I want to text her, I have so many questions in my mind, but I know that I shouldn’t. Sometimes I wonder if things would have been different if I had talked more instead of just saying “okay” that night, but I guess I’ll never get the answers to those questions. A part of me says that she will text me again, but maybe I’m just fooling myself. Is there any hope? what do I need to do?",1,1770129107.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Repped actor/filmmaker split my time between LA & NYC here looking to connect with a few talented writer/directors & DP's to collaborate on creating a few high-quality, very low budget short films. I got a great response posting this elsewhere and a bunch of zooms lined up this week so I figured I’d reach out here as well.

I’m a classically trained actor with good rep. & a few credits on major tv shows, hundreds of auditions for SAG tv/film, for very cool stuff like The Chair Company, The Agency, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood sequel, etc. Last week, I had auditions for a series regular on Joel Kinnamin's next Amazon show, a recurring guest for the Bosch prequel, and a large multi scene costar for Power Origins, just for context of where I’m at professionally and what I bring to the table.

My 1st short I wrote/directed was a police corruption conspiracy. My next two are a psychological thriller & a horror fable. Biggest influences are Fincher, anything HBO, Veep, Sopranos, Fargo, Leftovers, Mad Men, Succession, Mr InBetween, Arrested Development, Barry, The Terror, There Will Be Blood, Charlie Kaufman, Danny McBride, Adult Swim, Key & Peel, Kids in The Hall, The Peter Serafinowicz Show, etc. you get the idea.

My goal is to build a portfolio to use to solicit financing for a slate of features & series down the road + expand my network of filmmaker friends.

If you’re interested, shoot me a DM with a link to your reel / website + availability over the next 2 weeks & we can set up a time to grab coffee or Zoom & talk shop.

I'd do it back, harder, just to see if it would get him to stop. It never did though. I couldn't lay down on their couch while he was awake, or he'd grab my wrists or ankles, or one of each. It looked like he did it just to watch me struggle to get him to let me go. 

I remember at one point, he wouldn't let me alone and I was doing school work on my laptop. He unplugged it, hit my leg, grabbed my ankle and wouldn't let go, regardless of how much I twisted around. I stood up and hit him back. He went and took a shower, and my grandma came out of the bedroom telling me I should apologize to him because I ""really hurt him"". Completely ignoring the fact that he instigated it, and he hit me first. 

He would make comments about everything. He'd say I looked so much like my dad, but that wasn't a compliment. He said it was good I got glasses because it helped cover up my ""ugly"". He would interrogate me about school and question my intelligence. He'd make comments about what I ate or drank, how much, how fast, what my diet was like at home. He'd compare me to other girls my age. He'd make comments about my appearance. ""It looks like you gained weight."" ""It looks like you lost weight."" ""Keep eating like that, you'll get as big as your mom was."" 

He didn't know personal space. I knew better than to stand in front of their counter and face it, otherwise he would stand so close behind me. I could feel his breathing moving my hair. I don't even want to talk about what else was far too close to me when he would stand behind me like this. When I mentioned to my mom that I wanted to start wearing makeup, he said, ""You're just trying to look sexy for boys."" I was 12. I just wanted to wear makeup. 

My mom and grandma witnessed this all. They never said anything to him. In fact, sometimes they'd defend him, side with him, or tell me to be the bigger person and ignore him. I remember never wanting to be alone with him. He would work on his bike in a barn they had, and sometimes my grandma would ask my mom or me to bring him coffee. I never wanted to do it because I didn't want to be alone with him. I'd try to play it off and ask my mom to do it, and she would refuse to do it as well. I know why she refused. She knew why I refused. I never let them stick me in the car with him. If they left the house to go outside for a second, even just to get something out of the car or to look at their garden, and I was left in the house with my grandpa... I'd go with them. In cases where being alone with him was unavoidable, I felt like prey. I felt like I had to be on high alert. The hairs on my arms would raise. Ringing in my ears would get loud. I felt like a target. I don't know what I expected to happen, but I knew I couldn't let my guard down around him if we were alone. 

I didn't feel anything when he died. Visiting him in the hospital felt like a waste of time. The only reason I came was because I couldn't bring all of this up then. I couldn't tell them why I didn't want to be there. I wanted to be there for my mom, and that was about it. My mom and grandma never bring up how he acted, or the things he said or did to me. How they remember him is completely different from what I remember. 

I am holding a grudge against my grandma. I'm completely aware of that. I'm hurt. I don't know why she let her grown ass husband act like that towards me. I can't even bring it up because I'd be talking badly about her dead husband. She's constantly posting on Facebook about how much she misses him, or how lonely it is living alone now, or putting herself down. I don't care. If anything, I want her to feel bad. He's dead and I'm still dealing with all the bullshit he put me through. And I don't even get to fucking talk about it. 

I tolerate seeing her and responding to her texts every so often. For the most part, I don't want anything to do with her. Maybe I'm just being selfish. I don't really care if I am. ",1,1770128943.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

By Devlin Eggson

*Special to The New York Times*

Dotty’s Spotty Spoon diner on the corner of Summit Street in Smithfield, Pennsylvania is a long way from Washington D.C. So as flatware clattered on formica and longtime patrons limped to their booths for a late lunch on one recent afternoon, the conversation wasn’t about Senate budget negotiations: It about the new pastor at First Lutheran, the speed trap on Route 119 and the best way to stop the bleeding from a severed jugular. 

But when the topic did drift to politics, locals would flash a laboriously reconstructed smile and say that despite the headlines, they still stand behind the leopards that have eaten, and are continuing to eat, their faces.

*Processing img 1he2yvkbhahg1...*

“I may not agree with all the leopards’ decisions about whose face to eat and whatnot, but I can still see all the great things that they’re doing for America,” said Dale Stelnik, 68, a retired plastic salesman who has been blind since last September when a 75-pound female African leopard punctured both his eyeballs. 

For decades, Smithfield and surrounding Fayette County had been a stronghold of blue-collar Democrats, but in 2016 and again in 2024, voters here swung hard for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party. 

Voters then and now cited the economy and cost-of-living as their top concern. And on that score, many said that the leopards have delivered.

“Egg prices used to be out of control,” said administrative assistant Jane Foley, 33, through a tracheotomy stoma. “But now that I’m not eating solid foods anymore, my grocery bills have gotten a lot lower.” 

In the Spring, Federal budget cuts forced the town’s biggest employer, the SedateTech tranquilizer gun factory, to shut down. 247 employees lost their jobs. Local tourism has also slowed since summer, when leopards began dropping onto hikers from trees in nearby Ohiopyle State Park. 

But as their coffees are refilled, diners who can speak above a whisper are quick to point out the upside: The emergency room at Uniontown Hospital has tripled in size, and Keenan’s Funeral Home on Highland Street has an eight-month waiting list. 

Dotty Spentach, 42, owner of the Spotty Spoon, says that it’s too soon to judge what the new administration will mean for her business. In October the county shut her down for three days when her fry cooks’ open wounds kept oozing into the hollandaise. On the other hand, she’s hired two new waitresses to spoonfeed customers who no longer have hands.

The changes have been felt in every part of town. Coaches at Albert Gallatin High School get to go home a little earlier now that track and field practices have been cancelled, part of the Department of Education’s new Stop Running initiative. And in a part of the state where 74% of residents are classified as overweight or obese, the Pennsylvania Department of Health has reported that facial weight is down 22% in just six months.

*Processing img u9xtwgrihahg1...*

Most in Smithfield have seen the memes and giddy Youtube songs about leopards eating their faces. But at table 12, by the window overlooking the VFW parking lot, those memes just don’t ring true.

“Leopards didn’t eat my face,” said Dan Miller, 37, an HVAC technician, as he sipped Diet Coke. He pointed at his face. “This here was a mountain lion, or maybe a puma.” As Miller chuckled dismissively at the ignorance of faraway comments sections, Diet Coke dribbled through his perforated left cheek, down past where his lower lip used to be, and onto his partial chin.

Despite the local optimism, questions about some new federal policies have begun to emerge. During the election, strict immigration enforcement was one of the leopards’ best polling issues. So it came as a surprise to some in Smithfield when the State Department resettled 12 breeding pairs of Indian Leopards here just before mating season.

“It doesn’t make sense to me,” said 55 year-old account manager Lily Santiolo. “So are all these new immigrants going on welfare now? What on earth do these leopards think they’re going to eat here?”

Others have found themselves thinking that the issues may not be black and white. 

Mopping up the last of his yolk with a piece of toast, Phil Herman, 46, said that he had been drawn to the Leopards Eating Peoples’ Faces Party because of their strong stance against what he calls “all that transgender nonsense.”

“But ever since that leopard ripped my genitals to ribbons and drooled what was left of my urethra back into my open abdominal cavity, I sometimes find myself wondering – geez, which bathroom should I be using?” Still, Herman added, he believes that the leopards understand these complicated issues and whatever decisions they make will be the right ones.

The February sun was setting over the Alleghany foothills. Back at Table 12, Dan Miller had finished his Diet Coke with the help of a few napkins, and was sharing his thoughts on foreign policy.

“I think other countries, when they see how we just let wild animals tear off our faces and don’t make a big deal about it, they’ll realize how tough we are and they won’t mess with —”

Just then Miller glanced out the window and froze. A male Arabian leopard, glowing golden in the waning light, was sauntering down the center line of Summit Street. He was 150 pounds at least. After stretching his front legs, then his back, the leopard padded over to the sidewalk, laid down directly across from the diner, and began to wait.

As the dining room fell silent and the remaining Spotty Spoon patrons noticed, one after the other, who was outside, they all instinctively knew something that progressive activists and Democratic politicians have often struggled to understand. You probably can’t outrun a leopard that’s capable of 36 mile-per-hour bursts. But if you start back to your car right now, you just might be able to outrun everyone else in the diner, especially the ones in wheelchairs.

And so, with the hurried slamming of crumpled bills on tables and the squeak of sneakers on linoleum, another day in the heartland drew to a close.

Graph: surface area progression of fumed silica produced by the fumed silica reactor.

“The results of test 7, and subsequent analysis and verification by two unrelated independent entities, confirm that the fumed silica reactor is now producing fumed silica at the important 150 commercial product grade,” 

* said P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis. 

“As important is the fact that we have now replicated, at pilot scale, the results from our original lab-scale results for both viscosity and surface area of fumed silica. 

As some readers may recall, it was these initial findings that resulted in the interest exhibited by a global manufacturer of fumed silica, and with whom we have been working together to perfect the product. 

The question had always been, up to now, *‘…could we scale the results..?’* The viscosity results are particularly noteworthy, as it indicates that fumed silica produced at the pilot plant can be suitable for industrial applications including coatings, adhesives and sealants, inks, elastomers, and insulation binders where viscosity, often referred to as rheology efficiency, is a critical performance metric.”

For fumed silica use in traditional markets, performance and market value are also closely linked to specific surface area measurements. 

Ongoing system modifications to the fumed silica reactor over the past few months have progressively increased the surface area from an initial recorded result of 26 m^(2)/g to the current 191 m^(2)/g. 

The company will continue to improve surface area as it targets additional commercial applications. Commercial fumed silica products are sold at a variety of different surface area measurements,

* 130 m^(2)/g, 
* 150 m^(2)/g, 
* 200 m^(2)/g,

# INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONTEXT

* Fumed silica is one of the most widely used industrial materials, and can be found in thousands of products, including cosmetics, toothpaste, pet litter, powdered food, milkshakes, instant coffee, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, adhesives, paints, inks, photocopy toner, sealants, fiber optic cables, thermal insulation, construction materials, and batteries, to name a few. It is often used in these products as a thickening/anti-caking agent, used to stabilize and improve the texture, consistency, and flow of the end-product.
* Fumed silica is often combined with other materials to enhance performance. For example, in tires, it is blended with carbon-black to improve wear and efficiency; in batteries, it is blended with graphite to enhance slurry uniformity and conductivity.
* PyroGenesis has been engaged to develop and build the FSR pilot plant for HPQ Polvere Inc. (“Polvere”), a subsidiary of HPQ.
* PyroGenesis has: (i) a 50% interest in Polvere, and (ii) an exclusive arrangement to be the sole supplier of equipment relating to any commercialization of this new process.

It is often used in these products as a thickening/anti-caking agent, used to stabilize and improve the texture, consistency, and flow of the end-product.
* Fumed silica is often combined with other materials to enhance performance. For example, in tires, it is blended with carbon-black to improve wear and efficiency; in batteries, it is blended with graphite to enhance slurry uniformity and conductivity.
* PyroGenesis has been engaged to develop and build the FSR pilot plant for HPQ Polvere Inc. (“Polvere”), a subsidiary of HPQ.
* PyroGenesis has: (i) a 50% interest in Polvere, and (ii) an exclusive arrangement to be the sole supplier of equipment relating to any commercialization of this new process.

# About the Fumed Silica Reactor (FSR)

PyroGenesis has been designing, engineering, and constructing the fumed silica reactor pilot plant, for HPQ Polvere Inc., 

* to convert quartz into fumed silica in a single and eco-friendly step, without the use of chemicals while producing no hazardous by-products. 

The plant is operational and undergoing various tests to 

* (i) replicate the original lab-scale test results at pilot plant scale, which has now been achieved, 
* (ii) meet the benchmarks for progressively higher grades of commercial products, and 
* (iii) indicate the modifications necessary for the system to be fully scalable to various full-size commercial production levels.

*Fumed silica is now confirmed as being commercial grade 150 by* ***multiple labs.***

**PyroGenesis Inc**., the leader in ultra-high temperature processes and engineering innovation, and a plasma-based technology provider to heavy industry & defense,   
  
... confirms, further to a recent press release from the Company’s client HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ”), receipt by the Company of additional independent verification of its most recent test results for fumed silica produced by the fumed silica reactor (FSR).

Specifically, a potential customer \[[press release dated July 9, 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UCUvEovMipe49VNWU0zkEetBeFZVxWoB4D4pTWj4264N1BrNh912jXowKSWdQci35vD7JmeyzlVFLROh8U-O4bqzcJF_hk9JR7M8QN0qWn7YvnKqlRXzmIvDUY690zlpKM_MgszeCsp6cdlJJdY8PMm3KO3durZ_7MK3uwEMPxoIfiwTCZ-BOYV7CPD5wceLQWzBJT8G9GBXWCPVAIPqXvzVTOlvRadzovmHoXWPgsser6Hzgi4R08Yeqkiqb83B)\] who has been independently analyzing the various FSR test runs, 

* has confirmed that the material produced during Test #7 meets established commercial benchmarks for fumed silica with a specific surface area (under BET analysis) 
* of approximately 150 m²/g, while, more importantly, achieving the required viscosity for that commercial grade at the same time.

https://preview.redd.it/ss8fmnvtgahg1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8cbd10f89276e3b6b98f3c11c30abe74e8ab6f

  
  
Graph: surface area progression of fumed silica produced by the fumed silica reactor.

“The results of test 7, and subsequent analysis and verification by two unrelated independent entities, confirm that the fumed silica reactor is now producing fumed silica at the important 150 commercial product grade,” 

* said P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis. 

“As important is the fact that we have now replicated, at pilot scale, the results from our original lab-scale results for both viscosity and surface area of fumed silica. 

As some readers may recall, it was these initial findings that resulted in the interest exhibited by a global manufacturer of fumed silica, and with whom we have been working together to perfect the product. 

The question had always been, up to now, *‘…could we scale the results..?’* The viscosity results are particularly noteworthy, as it indicates that fumed silica produced at the pilot plant can be suitable for industrial applications including coatings, adhesives and sealants, inks, elastomers, and insulation binders where viscosity, often referred to as rheology efficiency, is a critical performance metric.”

For fumed silica use in traditional markets, performance and market value are also closely linked to specific surface area measurements. 

Ongoing system modifications to the fumed silica reactor over the past few months have progressively increased the surface area from an initial recorded result of 26 m^(2)/g to the current 191 m^(2)/g. 

The company will continue to improve surface area as it targets additional commercial applications. Commercial fumed silica products are sold at a variety of different surface area measurements, 

* including 90 m^(2)/g, 
* 130 m^(2)/g, 
* 150 m^(2)/g, 
* 200 m^(2)/g, 
* and 300 m^(2)/g.

She's gone. Packed up like she was never there. And I'm sitting in this bedsitter, the same one I told myself was temporary two years ago, staring at the ceiling like it owes me money. No Netflix. I don't even have a subscription, I use pirated sites. No music. Just me and the kind of silence that makes you think too much.

That's when my boy called.

Phone rings like he's been trying for a while. I almost didn't pick up. ""Tony. Tony,"" he calls me. ""There's a bungalow in Kiserian. One bed. We're going. NOW.""

I didn't even ask why. I just said yes. Anything to get me out of that room, man. Anything to stop thinking about her.

So off we go. Kiserian. Me and my boy, we catch a mat from Rongai, 50 bob. That's it. 50 bob to go chase something that might change your life.

We hop in the back of a matatu. Already packed. Smells like the usual, sweat, cheap cologne, someone's chapati. Normal. Then this guy gets in with his kid. Small girl, maybe five. The dad picks her up, sits her down on the seat, then turns to the makanga with that look, the one that says don't even think about it.

""Usijaribu kuweka mtu mwingine kwa hiyo seat, nailipia.""

Makanga just nods. Nobody argues.

And I'm watching this, man. The way he did it, calm. No shouting. No drama. Just quiet authority. The girl just sits there, happy, looking out the window like the world is hers and she's a princess, she got her dad right there. And something in my chest moved. That's the kind of man I wanna be. When I have kids. That guy who doesn't need to raise his voice to make the world stop for a second.

But then the matatu keeps moving and my brain keeps going back to where it doesn't want to go.

My boy's next to me. Quiet for a bit. Then I just say it. Can't hold it in.

""She's gone, bro.""

He looks at me. Doesn't say anything yet. Just waits. That's what boys do, they don't jump in with advice right away. They just... let you talk.

""Three years, man. Three years and she just... gone.""

""What can you do to get her back?"" he asks. Simple question. No judgment.

And I laugh. Not the funny kind. The kind that comes from somewhere deep and tired.

""Nothing. I got no money, bro. That's it. That's the whole story.""

Because that's the truth, man. That's the real truth nobody wants to say out loud. Guys in her DMs right now offering treats, dinner here, trip there, gifts. Meanwhile I'm sitting in a dingy bedsitter where water is always an issue and an M-Pesa balance that makes me close my eyes every time I check it.

Three years. Three years was worth it though. I mean that. She taught me things. She made me feel things I didn't know I could feel and I'm grateful for that. Every moment is for experience. But it's done now. And the only comeback I can have? My own cash. My own grind. That's all that's left.

Why is life like this though, man. Starting from down. No one to look up to. No blueprint. No daddy who left you something. You just wake up one day and the world says ""figure it out"" and that's supposed to be enough.

My boy nods. He gets it. We both come from the same place.

Then he says, casual, like he's quoting scripture, ""As Kibe said... kama huna pesa hufai kudate.""

We both laugh. Actually laugh. The kind where you're hurting but it's funny because it's true. Painfully true. And honestly? The heartbreak is even worth it, man. Looking at it now, sitting here in this matatu with 50 bob spent and nothing but time ahead of me, at least now I'll focus. No more distractions. No more wondering if she's happy. Just me and the grind.

We chat the rest of the way. Just vibing. Boys talk, you know how it is, the journey from Rongai to Kiserian it's nothing amazing to see from the outside. Two guys in the back of a matatu not saying much, half laughing at random things, half staring out the window. But that's where the healing happens, man. Not in therapy. Not in crying alone. Just... this. Two boys and a moving matatu and the road ahead.

We get to Kiserian. Step off the mat and just... stop. Both of us. Standing there like two tourists who accidentally stumbled onto somewhere unknown.

Ngong Hills are visible. Right there. Not on a screen. Not on someone's Instagram. Right there in front of us, green and massive and just sitting there like it's been waiting. The sky is that kind of blue you only see outside Nairobi, man. The real kind.

My boy's looking around, taking it in. Then he turns to me and says, ""Bro... let's stop at a butchery and order half kg of meat. Kiserian is known for that stuff.""

And for a second I'm actually excited. Because yes. Kiserian meat is a whole thing. You can't come here and not eat, that would be a crime, man.

Then reality hits. Like a cold bucket of water right on your face.

I look at my boy. He looks at me. We both know.

""Unakula na pesa gani?"" he says.

And we laugh. Both of us. Proper laugh. The kind where you're slapping your thigh and shaking your head at the same time. Because it's funny. It's actually hilarious. Two guys standing in one of the most beautiful parts of Kenya, Ngong Hills literally breathing in front of them, and they can't even afford a plate of nyama choma.

No money no meat, man. That's the summary of our whole lives right there.

But we haven't reached the bungalow yet. Not even close.

So we flag down a boda. Hop on, me behind my boy and the boda guy riding. Off we go toward St Patrick school. My boy starts chit chatting the boda guy, that's him, always talking, always connecting. Me? I'm behind. Quiet. Just watching.

And bro... just past Kiserian, everything changes.

It's not even a gradual thing. It's immediate. The roads are smooth, like properly done smooth. Not the Nairobi kind where your whole body is a shock absorber. These are clean roads. Tarmac. Good tarmac. And on either side, green. Just green everywhere. Trees. Bushes. Open land. No billboards. No matatu horns. No one shouting. The Ngong Hills view keeps getting better and better the further we go.

And I thought this place was going to be dusty, man. Kajiado vibes, dry, sandy, that kind of thing. But no. Not even close. I'm left in awe.

The air hits my face and it's different. I can't explain it. It's not Nairobi air. Nairobi air is... heavy. You breathe it and you don't even notice because you're used to it. But this? This is the kind of air that makes you actually feel your lungs. Like they've been waiting for this their whole life.

And I'm on this boda, wind coming at me, and I start thinking. Really thinking.

I've always been that guy. The one who says the city is better. Nairobi is where it's at, the hustle, the energy, the connections. I used to say it all the time. ""I'm a young boy, the city is my playground. I can navigate through it bila tatizo."" And I meant it. I believed it.

But sitting on this boda, watching the hills get bigger and the noise get quieter... I think I was wrong, man. I think I was wrong the whole time.

Then the wind picks up.

And it hits my eyes. Hard. The kind that makes them water whether you want them to or not. Tears just start coming, involuntary, burning, the whole thing. And I'm on this boda trying to wipe my face with one hand while holding on with the other like an idiot.

But here's the thing.

It's also a valid reason to cry about her, man. The wind. I can blame the wind. Nobody's going to look at a guy on a boda with watering eyes and think ""oh he's heartbroken."" They'll just think ""ni upepo ya boda."" And for a second, just one second, I let it happen. I let the tears come. Not just from the wind. From everything. From her. From the three years. From the guy in the matatu with his kid and the quiet authority I want to have someday. From the meat we couldn't afford. From the fact that I'm 21 and still figuring out what I'm supposed to be.

The wind took them. I blamed the wind. And that was enough, man.

We reach St Patrick. I get off first. My boy follows, already phone out, making the call. The guy who's supposed to show us the bungalow. He picks up after two rings.

""We're here,"" my boy says. ""St Patrick.""

A pause.

""He's coming to pick us up.""

So we wait. Two guys. No money for meat. Eyes still a little red. Standing by St Patrick school in Kiserian with Ngong Hills now visible so well, clearer than ever, and something in the air that feels like the beginning of something, man. We just don't know what yet.

Then I turn to my boy. Can't hold it.

""Manze... this place. This isn't what I had in mind at all, bro.""

He raises an eyebrow.

""Inakaa much much better than I expected. Like... way better. I could actually hamia huku. I could live here, man.""

He laughs. Proper laugh. Slaps my shoulder.

""Anto wewe ndo husema you wanna stay kwa town. Huelewekangi.""

And I just shake my head, smiling. ""Change of mind. Things happen, bro. This place... it does something to you.""

We stand there for a moment. Both of us looking at the hills. The quiet. The clean air. And for a few minutes it all makes sense, the move, the bungalow, the new life. It's right there. I can almost touch it.

Then my boy says it.

Casual. Like he's just stating the weather.

""But this place favours someone akona gari, Tony. You don't have a gari.""

And there it is.

Reality. Again. Coming back like it never left. Like it was just hiding behind the Ngong Hills the whole time, waiting for the right moment to step out and remind me.

No car. No meat. No money. No her.

I look down at my shoes. Then back up at the hills. Same hills. Same beautiful view. Same clean air. Nothing changed about the place.

Everything changed about me.

What did I do wrong, man. That's the question that keeps coming back. Not ""what should I do next"" or ""how do I fix this."" Just... what did I do wrong. To be here. To be 21. To be standing in one of the most beautiful places in Kenya and still feel like the ground is shaking under my feet.

My boy's quiet now too. He knows. He doesn't need to say anything else.

We just stand there. Waiting for the guy to come pick us up. Two boys by St Patrick school. Broke. Heartbroken. But standing in a place that somehow, for some reason, feels like it's meant for them.

Just not yet, man. Not yet.

The guy shows up like he's been jogging. Slightly out of breath. Daps us up, me first, then my boy. Quick handshake, the kind where you hold it for a second longer than usual because you're strangers pretending you're not.

""Karibu, karibu,"" he says. Smiling. Relaxed. The kind of guy who's done this before, shown people places, read the room, let the property do the talking.

Then my boy does what my boy always does. Starts talking. Engaging. Asking questions. Laughing at something the guy says before the joke is even finished. That's him. That's always been him. People gravitate to him like that, natural, effortless.

Me? I'm behind. Lagging. A few steps back. Spirit low. The whole thing still sitting on my chest like something heavy I can't put down. I'm watching them walk and talk ahead of me and I'm just... here. In my own head. Thinking about her. Thinking about the money. Thinking about everything and nothing at the same time.

But I keep walking. Because that's what men do, man. These are the days that make you stronger. You don't stop walking just because the weight is heavy. You just walk slower. But you walk.

Five minutes. That's what he said. And it felt like twenty.

Then we turn a corner and there it is.

The black gate.

I stop. Not dramatically. Not like in a movie. I just... stop. And I look at it.

And honestly? My first reaction was nothing. Nothing at all.

Because bro, I've been to properties before. Many of them. Kilimani showrooms where the agent is wearing a suit that costs more than my rent. Westlands apartments where the elevator alone makes you feel like you don't belong. Kileleshwa, Lavington, name them all. I've walked through places that looked like they belonged on magazine covers. I've seen the ""executive finishes."" I've seen the glass and the marble and the rooftop views.

So when I saw that gate, my brain said, yeah okay. Another one. Let's see.

We walk through.

And then everything I just said? Gone.

The place is sitting there just calm. Not the fake kind, the real kind. Dark walls. Black. Clean black. And green, everywhere. Banana trees. The whole thing just breathing. Like the place itself is alive and it knows it.

And the quiet, man. It's not Nairobi quiet. Nairobi quiet is just the absence of noise for thirty seconds before a matatu horn breaks it. This is different. This is the kind of quiet where you actually hear birds. Actual birds. Singing. Like they chose this place specifically.

We pull out our gadgets and start taking pictures.

And here's the thing that got me.

The photos. On the screen. The way the place looked through the lens, it looked even more insane than it did with my own eyes. Like the camera was seeing something my brain was still catching up to. I'm scrolling through what I just took and I'm like... bro. This is real. This is actually real.

And my mind starts painting pictures. Not of the place as it is. Of the place as it could be.

Me. Here. A grill right out there by the garden, one of those proper charcoal ones. Nyama choma on a Saturday afternoon. My bros pulling up. A car parked right there, mine. My car. Not a boda. Not a matatu. A car I own, parked in front of a place I own. The Ngong Hills in the background. The air. The quiet. The smoke from the grill mixing with the breeze.

That's a man cave, man. That's the real definition of it. Not a room with a TV and some gaming chairs in some Nairobi apartment. This. This right here. Serenity. Space. Peace. The kind of place where you can actually breathe and think and build something.

Then we walk inside.

Bro.

The living room.

Brown leather sofas, the real kind, not the fake shiny ones that crack after two months. White tiles so clean you're actually scared to step on them. Like, genuinely scared. You look down at your shoes and you're like... I should have washed these before coming here.

The kitchen is right there, open, connected to the living room. And the pendant lights hanging above it, somebody thought about this. Somebody actually sat down and said ""when the sun goes down, how is this going to look?"" And they got it right. Warm light. Soft. The kind that makes everything look golden.

And then.

On the counter.

A coffee machine.

A proper coffee machine. In a 4.7 mil bungalow. Sitting there like it belongs. Like it's been waiting for someone to come in and actually use it every morning before they start their day.

Meanwhile my bedsitter doesn't even have a working tap, man. I have to fill a bucket from the neighbor's tap and carry it up three flights of stairs just to wash my face in the morning.

I just stood there. Hands in pockets. Looking around like I was in a museum. Like if I touched anything it would disappear or someone would come and tell me I don't belong here.

My boy's watching me from across the room. He's not saying anything. He doesn't need to. He knows. He can see it happening, that thing where your brain starts doing math you didn't ask it to do. The kind of math that starts with a number and ends with a dream.

He just stands there. Watching me. Smiling a little.

And says nothing.

Because some moments don't need words, man. Some moments you just have to stand in.

A few minutes pass. Nobody moves. Nobody talks. Just the two of us in this living room with the birds outside and the pendant lights doing their thing.

Then my boy breaks it.

""Anto..."" he says. Casual. Too casual. The kind of casual that means something's coming.

He walks over. Pretends to hand me the keys, just snatches them from the guy's hand for a second, dangles them in front of my face like he's in a comedy skit.

""Shika hii. Ukuwe unaishi hapa.""

And he laughs. That laugh of his, the loud one. The one that fills a room.

He's trolling. Obviously trolling. That's him. Always trolling. Always finding a way to make you laugh when everything is heavy.

But here's the thing.

He put it in my head.

And it stayed.

4.7 million. That number. It just sits there now. In the back of my mind. Not going anywhere.

So I step outside again. Alone this time. Walk into the garden. Stand there. Look up at Ngong Hills, right there, like it was placed on purpose, like someone designed this whole view just for this moment.

The air. Clean. Cool. Like your lungs have been breathing through a dirty cloth your whole life and suddenly someone pulls it off and says ""this is how it's supposed to feel.""

And my brain starts working. Really working. Not the sad kind of thinking. The building kind.

I'm a tech bro. That's what I do. I build things. Apps. Systems. Things that make money if you do them right. And 4.7 million ksh...

Let me convert that.

I pull out my phone. Open the calculator. Type it in.

And I just stare at the number.

That's it. That's the number between me and this place, man. For a tech guy that's... that's one good app. One good contract. One focused year of grinding with zero distractions. Zero heartbreak drama. Zero noise. Just code and the quiet and the Ngong Hills outside my window every single morning.

And my brain starts drawing the blueprint.

One floor up. That's all it takes. I add one floor to this bungalow. Ground floor, I live. Kitchen. Living room. The sofas. The coffee machine. The whole thing. Upper floor, my lab. Screens. Servers. Keyboards. Monitors. Everything. Wake up, pour coffee from that machine downstairs, walk up, sit down, code for 12 hours straight, look out the window at Ngong Hills when my eyes get tired, eat, sleep, repeat. For a year. Maybe two.

No drama. No heartbreak. No matatu noise. No neighbor's tap. No bedsitter ceiling staring back at me. Just me and the grind and the quiet and the hills.

Every tech bro dreams about this, man. The quiet place. The space. The peace to actually build something that matters. Away from everything that's been pulling you down.

I walk back inside. My boy's leaning on the kitchen counter, scrolling his phone. Looks up at me.

I look at him.

""That's like... thirty-six thousand dollars, bro.""

He raises an eyebrow.

I nod.

""That's nothing, man. That's peanuts. One app. One deal. One year of not wasting time on things that don't matter.""

My boy just looks at me for a second. Doesn't laugh this time. Doesn't troll. Just looks at me like he can see something changing behind my eyes.

And maybe he can.

Because something did change, man. Standing in that garden. Looking at those hills. Doing that math.

4.7 million. Thirty-six thousand dollars. One app. One year.

It's not a dream anymore.

It's a plan.

And you know what happens when a boy with nothing to lose starts believing in something? He becomes dangerous, man. The good kind of dangerous. The kind that doesn't make sense to people on the outside. The kind where everyone around you is like ""bro relax, be realistic"" but you're already three steps ahead in your own head.

I'm standing there in that living room. 21 years old. No money. No car. No girl. No working tap. Nothing. Literally nothing.

And for the first time in my life that doesn't feel like a bad thing.

Because a boy with nothing to lose? He's free, man. There's no floor to fall through anymore. You're already there. At the bottom. So the only direction is up. And when you realize that, when it actually clicks, something in you shifts. Something that was sleeping wakes up.

People call it delusion. That's what they'll say. ""Anto is being delusional again."" And yeah. Maybe. At first it is delusion. Pure delusion. A broke boy in a bedsitter in Rongai dreaming about a bungalow in Kiserian with Ngong Hills and a coffee machine and a lab on the second floor.

But here's what nobody tells you about delusion, man.

Sometimes it's the first step before the solution. The delusion comes first. Then the work. Then the reality. That's the order. Nobody builds something by being ""realistic"" from day one. You have to be a little crazy first. You have to see something that doesn't exist yet and believe it will. That's not stupidity. That's how it starts.

I need this place, man.

I said it. Out loud. Just like that. Standing there in the garden with my phone in my hand and pictures of the bungalow filling up my camera roll.

I need this place. I need a car. I need all of it. The good things. Everything. The life that makes sense. The life where you wake up and the first thing you see isn't a cracked ceiling and a bucket of water. The life where you sit down with your coffee, from that machine, that specific machine, and you look out at hills and you think ""I built this. Me. From nothing.""

Because who limits you, man? Who? If it ain't yourself.

That's it. That's the only wall. Not the money. Not the system. Not the economy or the government or whatever people blame when they're still in the same place five years later. It's you. It's the voice in your own head that says ""you can't."" The one that says ""be realistic."" The one that whispers every morning before you even open your eyes.

Fuck that voice.

And fuck that girl, man.

I said it. And it felt good. Not the angry kind. Not the bitter kind where you're sitting in a dark room hating someone. The releasing kind. The kind where you look at the space she left and instead of feeling empty you feel light. Because she was never the plan. She was never going to be the reason I build something. And chasing her, chasing what she wanted, trying to be enough for her, that was the thing slowing me down.

Not anymore.

Fuck that girl. I'm building a bungalow.

My boy's watching me the whole time. He's been quiet for a minute. Then I turn to him and I say it, all of it. The place. The car. The lab. The grind. Everything. Just spitting it out like it's already happening.

And he just nods.

Slowly.

Then smiles.

""Ndo hiyo sasa,"" he says. Simple. Like he's been waiting for me to say it the whole time.

Ndo hiyo sasa. That's it. That's all he needed to say. Because that's what boys do, man. They don't give you a speech. They don't motivate you with some loud, dramatic pep talk. They just... nod. They say ""ndo hiyo."" And that single nod carries more weight than a thousand words.

And I can't stop thinking about it.

So we stay a little longer.

Not because of anything planned. We just... don't leave. Not yet. My boy pulls out his phone, ""bro tustroll tena,"" and we start walking around again. Taking more pictures. More videos this time. Slow ones. The kind where you're not in a rush. The garden. The kitchen. The view from outside. The hills. The gate. The whole thing.

We capture everything like we're documenting evidence. Like if we don't, no one will believe us later. Like we need proof that this place exists. That we were here. That we saw it.

And then, out of nowhere, the dogs.

Two of them. Come trotting from somewhere behind the property like they own the place. Both white, one called Snoopy, I can't remember the other one. Not aggressive. Not barking. Just... curious. Walking up to us like ""who are you two and what are you doing in our garden?""

My boy crouches down immediately. Hand out. Snoopy sniffs it first, takes its time, looks at him like it's interviewing him for a position. Then licks his hand.

""Bro..."" my boy laughs. ""They like us.""

And I'm watching this, two broke boys and two dogs in a garden in Kiserian with Ngong Hills behind them, and something about it feels right, man. Like a scene from someone else's life. The kind of life you see on someone's Instagram and you think ""must be nice."" But here we are. In it. For real.

The dogs follow us around for a few more minutes. Snoopy keeps bumping against my leg like it's trying to tell me something. I crouch down and scratch behind its ears and it just closes its eyes.

""You and me both, bro,"" I tell the dog. ""We both need a home.""

My boy catches that. Doesn't say anything. Just smiles.

We take a few more pictures with them. Stupid ones. The kind you take when you're just happy and you don't care how you look. Then we say our goodbyes, to the dogs, to the place, to the guy who showed it to us.

And we leave.

Walk back to St Patrick. Flag down a bike to Kiserian town, then hop in a matatu. Same way we came. 50 bob back to Rongai.

But everything is different now, man.

The matatu feels smaller on the way back. Nairobi feels louder. The traffic, the horns, the dust, the noise, all of it. Like someone turned the volume up while we were gone. Like the city is testing us. Reminding us where we actually live.

We get to Rongai. My boy daps me up at the stage. ""Ndo hiyo sasa, Tony,"" he says one more time. And walks off toward his place.

And I walk to mine.

Up the stairs. The ones that creak. Past the neighbor's door where the tap works and mine doesn't. Into my bedsitter. The same ceiling. The same small room. The same everything.

I sit down on my bed. Phone in my hand. I open my camera roll and scroll through the pictures. The bungalow. The garden. The dark walls. The coffee machine. The hills. The dogs. All of it, right there on my screen.

4.7 million.

One app. One year.

I lock my phone and put it down. Stare at the ceiling for a long time.

Then I open my laptop.

And I start working.

Because there is a day, man. There is a day where this bedsitter becomes a memory. Where Rongai is just a place I used to pass through. Where 4.7 million is not a dream I had on a Sunday afternoon but a receipt I hold in my hand.

There is a day.

I don't know when. I don't know how exactly. But I know it's coming. I can feel it the same way I felt that air in Kiserian, clean, different, real.

There is a day, man.

This happened on February 1 at a friend’s birthday in Makati. I’m (F23) bisexual and only recently admitted it to myself. At the bar, I noticed a woman (F24) across from our table exactly my type, but she gave strong “straight” vibes so I didn’t expect anything to happen. Not long after, we ran into each other in the restroom and talked about makeup, hair products, and nails. I invited her to join our table, and she did. When her friends and cousin left, she stayed and join us my friends are very open and welcoming. We talked about careers, future plans, and love lives. My attention was mostly on her, but I still interacted with my friends. Around midnight, since she lives far and I’m from QC, I suggested she stay over at my place.
At my place, I let her shower first while I prepared clothes, then showered after. I asked if she wanted coffee, and she agreed. While sipping coffee, we talked about sexual experiences. I asked if she’d kissed a girl she said no. She asked me, and I said no. I was about to change the topic when she asked if I wanted to try. I kissed her, and we ended up sleeping together. It was both our first time with a woman. The next morning, she had already left but left a note and cooked food for me. Since then, I haven’t stopped thinking about her not just sexually, but in a more wholesome way. I later found her social media and confirmed she’s straight, which makes me think it may have just been curiosity.

Something like a bakery that makes really killer coffee or a coffee shop that has amazing sandwiches.,"I was thinking recently that one of my personal rules of thumb is that, besides desperation purchases, I won't generally buy something that is outside a business' area of expertise. Like, I don't get coffee at bakeries, I don't usually get any type of food at a coffee shop, and even though there are restaurants that do have great bar programs and bars that have great food menus, I don't usually tend to get cocktails in a restaurant or food at a bar unless I know beforehand that it's something they're also known for.  


But I've been thinking that there's got to be some stuff that I'm missing out on, so I'm curious if there are any foods or drinks that you really love, even if it's just a singular menu item, that you get at a place where you wouldn't have expected it. ",2,1770127502.0,FoodNYC,6,0.75,False

We've been together for years now, and sometimes you just hit those moments where you realize how truly lucky you are. It's not about grand romantic gestures, but the little things that really get me.

Like, a few weeks ago, I had a brutal week at work. We're talking late nights, endless meetings, and my brain felt like scrambled eggs. I dragged myself home, utterly drained, just wanting to crash. As soon as I walked through the door, the scent of fresh coffee hit me – not just any coffee, but my favorite obscure blend that he knows I only have on special occasions. He was already in the kitchen, not saying much, just quietly making dinner and had a warm mug waiting for me.

He didn't make a big deal out of it, just a soft, ""Hey, tough day?"" and a gentle squeeze on my shoulder. It was exactly what I needed. No pressure to talk, just pure, quiet understanding and comfort. Later, when I was finally unwinding on the couch, he brought over my favorite fuzzy blanket and just draped it over me, then sat down and started reading his book, creating this incredible cocoon of peace. It was such a small thing, but it felt like the entire weight of the week just lifted off my shoulders.

And it's not a one-off. Every time I'm feeling down or overwhelmed, he has this sixth sense. Whether it's leaving my favorite snack on my desk before a big deadline, or just making sure my side of the bed is extra warm when I'm feeling chilly. It's those consistent, thoughtful acts of kindness that truly make me fall in love with him all over again every single day.

I have about 2.5 days left in Tokyo. So far, I still haven’t had the chance to chill in a really cool coffee spot or grab a drink at a nice, atmospheric pub — which I’m really hoping to do before I leave.

Tomorrow I’m heading to Meiji Shrine and Daikanyama, and would love suggestions for:

☕ A cool, stylish café with great coffee — somewhere that makes you want to step inside

🍺 A great pub/bar with a fun vibe for the evening

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I’m in uni and I have 2 uni friends. One of them is really outgoing extroverted always wanted to hang out doing meaningless things. a few months back I realized it stresses me out and I wanted to distance myself. I did do that nicely. We still talk but not like how it was before. anyways today after uni we talked while we were going to our cars. And then 2 hours later she sends me a snap of her and someone eating at a restaurant we went to b4. 

what is it exactly that I’m feeling? I don’t understand. Am I upset that she didn’t ask me to come ?  Do I feel left out? 
 
I know that this is what I wanted and tbh Im good with how things are now. but idk I don’t mind going out every now and then 

(She also did sth odd the a few days ago, we were at a coffee shop planning our schedules for uni and she called her friend from back home just to gossip about boys, while I was sitting next to her???). It was weird since She used to ALWAYS talk to me about boys (which I was tired of tbh :) is she trying to be rude or what cuz wtf

1quskn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1quskn0/the_psychology_of_friendship_most_people_get/,The Psychology of Friendship: Most People Get STUCK at Stage 3 (Here's Why),"I've been studying human connection for years (books, psychology research, podcasts) and realized something wild: most of us are stuck in surface level friendships and don't even know it. We think we're close with people, but we're actually operating at like 30% capacity. The scary part? This isn't our fault. Modern life literally trains us to stay shallow. We're overscheduled, overworked, and hiding behind screens. But here's what I learned from diving deep into attachment theory, social psychology research, and honestly just observing my own friendships: there are clear stages to building real connections, and understanding them changes everything.

Stage 1: Stranger to Acquaintance

This is where you meet someone and exchange basic info. What you do, where you're from, surface level stuff. Most interactions die here because nobody pushes past small talk. The filter is simple: do we have enough in common to keep talking?

Stage 2: Acquaintance to Casual Friend

You start hanging out in group settings. Maybe you grab coffee occasionally. You know their interests and can have decent conversations, but you're still performing a version of yourself. Everything stays pretty positive and uncontroversial. This is where most ""friendships"" live and die.

Stage 3: Casual Friend to Close Friend

Here's where it gets real, and where most people tap out. This requires vulnerability. You start sharing actual struggles, fears, embarrassing moments. The research is clear on this (from Brené Brown's work on vulnerability and Dr. Arthur Aron's studies on interpersonal closeness): deep friendship requires emotional risk.

But our biology fights against this. We're wired to protect ourselves from rejection. Opening up triggers our threat response because historically, being cast out from the group meant death. Your brain literally treats potential friendship rejection like a physical threat.

[The Friendship Formula](https://robindunbar.com/books/) by Robin Dunbar (Oxford evolutionary psychologist, literally THE expert on social relationships) breaks this down perfectly. He explains why we max out at around 150 connections, and why most people only have 3-5 truly close friends. The book includes decades of research on how friendship quality beats quantity every single time. Honestly changed how I think about investing my social energy.

To reach stage 3, you need consistent 1 on 1 time and genuine sharing. Try the 36 Questions study approach (developed by psychologist Arthur Aron), asking progressively deeper questions over time.

Stage 4: Close Friend to Intimate Friend

This is ride or die territory. You've seen each other at absolute worst and stuck around. There's zero performance, total acceptance. You can sit in silence comfortably. Call them at 3am and they answer. These friendships require years and serious life experiences together.

The key shift: moving from ""what can this person do for me"" to ""how can I show up for them."" [The Psychology of Friendship](https://www.mahzadhojjat.com/) by Mahzad Hojjat literally maps out the neuroscience here. Shows how these bonds activate the same brain regions as romantic love. Deep read but absolutely fascinating if you want to understand why some friendships feel irreplaceable.

Most people never hit stage 4 because it demands sacrifice. Showing up when it's inconvenient. Having hard conversations. Forgiving major screw ups. Our individualistic culture doesn't really teach us how to do this.

Stage 5: Intimate Friend to Chosen Family

Rare as hell but magical. These people become part of your identity. You make major life decisions considering their input. They know your family, your history, everything. Platonic soulmate vibes.

Getting here requires literal decades usually, plus major life transitions navigated together (moving cities, career changes, loss, marriages). You've proven mutual commitment repeatedly.

The Reality Check

Research from the Survey Center on American Life found that American men's close friendships have declined dramatically. In 1990, 55% of men reported having at least 6 close friends. By 2021, only 27% did. Women fare slightly better but the trend is similar.

We're lonelier than ever despite being more ""connected."" The fix isn't more friends, it's deeper ones. Quality over quantity every single time.

The good news: you can actively build this. It just requires intention. Pick 2-3 people you genuinely vibe with and invest heavily. Schedule regular hangouts. Ask the uncomfortable questions. Be the friend who actually shows up.

Also check out [The Friendship Cure](https://www.kateleaver.com/) by Kate Leaver if this resonates. She interviews neuroscientists, psychologists, and regular people about why friendship literally keeps us alive longer (the data on this is insane). Super accessible read that'll make you want to text your friends immediately.

Being socially awkward isn't a personality flaw. It's a skill gap. And gaps can be filled.

I spent years analyzing this shit, everything from psychology research to interviewing people who seem naturally charismatic. Read books, watched hours of body language experts on YouTube, listened to podcasts about social dynamics. The truth? Most ""naturally social"" people just learned these patterns earlier. You're not broken. You're just late to the game.

Here's what I found that actually moves the needle.

# Step 1: Stop Apologizing for Existing

Socially awkward people do this thing where they shrink. They apologize for speaking, for taking up space, for having opinions. You walk into a room like you're trespassing. That energy is contagious, and people pick up on it instantly.

Start here: **Stop saying ""sorry"" unless you actually did something wrong.** Bumped into someone? ""Excuse me"" works. Late to a meeting? ""Thanks for waiting"" instead of ""Sorry I'm late, traffic was crazy, my alarm didn't go off, I'm the worst.""

Replace apologetic language with neutral or confident language. Instead of ""This might be a dumb question but..."" just ask the damn question. Your brain will fight you on this. Do it anyway.

# Step 2: Master the Art of Shutting Up and Listening

Here's a mind blower: most conversations aren't about what YOU say. They're about making the other person feel heard. Socially awkward people often panic and word vomit, trying to fill silence or prove they're interesting.

Bad move.

Try this instead: **Ask questions and actually listen to the answers.** Not the fake listening where you're planning what to say next. Real listening. When someone tells you they went hiking last weekend, don't immediately launch into your hiking story. Ask them which trail, what they saw, if they do it often.

The book [**""How to Win Friends and Influence People""** by Dale Carnegie](https://dn720004.ca.archive.org/0/items/english-collections-1/How%20To%20Win%20Friends%20And%20Influence%20People%20-%20Carnegie%2C%20Dale.pdf) (yeah, it's from 1936, but it's still the bible for this stuff) breaks this down perfectly. Carnegie was a communications expert who trained thousands of people in social skills. The core insight? People love talking about themselves. Let them. Your job is to be genuinely curious.

This one shift will make you more likable than 80% of people who just wait for their turn to talk.

# Step 3: Fix Your Body Language Before Your Words

You could have the wittiest things to say, but if your body screams ""I want to disappear,"" nobody's hearing you.

Quick fixes:

* **Uncross your arms.** Crossed arms = defensive, closed off.
* **Stand up straight.** Slouching makes you invisible.
* **Make eye contact for 3-5 seconds** at a time, then look away naturally. Not a death stare. Not at your shoes.
* **Face people with your whole body** when they're talking to you, not just your head.

Watch Charisma on Command on YouTube. They break down body language from celebrities and public figures in a way that's actually useful. The channel analyzes everything from how comedians command a room to why certain actors seem more magnetic. It's free education that beats any expensive course.

[**Vanessa Van Edwards' book ""Captivate""**](https://archive.org/details/captivatescience0000edwa/page/n5/mode/2up) is also insanely good for this. She's a behavioral investigator who studied thousands of hours of social interactions. The book has specific, research backed techniques for body language, conversation starters, and reading social cues. One trick from her: the ""launch stance,"" where you keep your body slightly angled toward an exit during small talk. It signals you're engaged but not trapped, which makes both parties more comfortable.

# Step 4: Practice Small Talk Like It's a Video Game

Small talk feels fake and pointless when you're awkward. But it's actually the social warm up that builds trust. You wouldn't jump straight into deadlifting 300 pounds. You warm up first. Same concept.

Create a mental list of **go to questions**:

* ""What's keeping you busy these days?""
* ""How do you know \[host/mutual friend\]?""
* ""Seen any good shows lately?""
* ""What's your take on \[recent relevant event\]?""

These aren't deep, and that's the point. You're building rapport, not proposing marriage. Practice these with baristas, Uber drivers, people in line. Low stakes practice.

And here's the key: when someone gives you an answer, find **one thing to dig deeper on**. They mention a show? Ask what they like about it. They talk about work? Ask what got them into that field. Conversation is like pulling a thread. You don't need to be clever. Just curious.

# Step 5: Embrace the Awkward Silence

Silence feels like death when you're socially anxious. So you panic and say something stupid just to fill the void. Stop doing that.

**Silence isn't your enemy.** Sometimes a pause means the other person is thinking. Sometimes it's natural rhythm. Not every second needs words. Learn to sit in it for 2-3 seconds without freaking out.

If it stretches longer and feels genuinely awkward? Acknowledge it with humor: ""Well, that was a smooth transition"" or ""I just blanked on what I was saying."" People respect someone who can laugh at themselves.

# Step 6: Get Out of Your Head

Socially awkward people live in their heads. You're analyzing everything you say, how you said it, how the other person reacted, what you should say next. It's exhausting and it shows.

**The fix: Focus outward, not inward.** Notice details about the other person. Their watch. Their energy. The way they talk about certain topics. When you're focused on THEM, you're not spiraling about yourself.

There's an app called Finch that helps with this kind of mental habit building. It's technically a self care app, but it has exercises for social anxiety and being present. You set daily goals like ""practice active listening in one conversation"" and it tracks your progress. Gamifying this stuff actually helps your brain rewire.

If you want something more structured for building social confidence long term, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app from a team of Columbia grads and former Google experts that pulls from communication books, psychology research, and expert insights to create custom audio learning plans. You type in a specific goal like ""become more magnetic in conversations as an introvert"" and it builds a whole roadmap tailored to your personality and struggles.

The depth is adjustable too, anywhere from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with real examples when you want more detail. It includes the books mentioned here plus tons more on social dynamics, charisma, and communication. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smooth, confident tone that makes listening feel less like work and more like having a smart friend walk you through this stuff during your commute.

# Step 7: Accept You'll Be Awkward Sometimes

Last thing, and this is important: **You're not trying to become smooth 100% of the time.** Even the most charismatic people have off days, say dumb shit, or misread a room.

The difference? They don't spiral about it afterward. They move on.

You said something weird? Laugh it off and keep going. Someone didn't laugh at your joke? Shrug and change topics. Social skills aren't about perfection. They're about recovery.

**The podcast ""The Art of Charm""** covers this mindset stuff really well. The hosts interview everyone from FBI negotiators to dating coaches, and a common theme is that confident people aren't fearless, they just don't let small failures derail them. Binge a few episodes and you'll start seeing patterns in how socially successful people think.

# Step 8: Put in Reps

You can read every book and watch every video, but **nothing replaces actual practice**. Join a club. Take a class. Go to meetups. The more you expose yourself to social situations, the less your brain treats them as threats.

Start small. Coffee shop conversations. Commenting in online communities. Small group hangouts before big parties. Build your tolerance gradually.

Social skills are like a muscle. The more you use them, the stronger they get. You're not going to wake up tomorrow as the life of the party. But six months from now, if you're intentional about this? You'll be a different person.

Look, being socially awkward sucks. But it's fixable. Not overnight. Not with some magic trick. But with consistent effort and the right frameworks, you can go from the person hiding in the corner to someone who actually enjoys being around people.

Stop waiting to feel ready. You'll never feel ready. Just start.",2,1770126452.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
1quscoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopGGs/comments/1quscoa/some_of_my_utmost_favourite_kpop_albumseps/,Some of my utmost favourite K-pop albums/EPs!,"This is just a little appreciation post for albums that are so perfectly crafted! Please feel free to share yours below!

.✦ ݁˖ **REBOOT**\- Wonder Girls

I lOVE this album so much! It shows such a nice blend of ethereal songs, while also incorporating a more daring atmosphere in others.

My favourite songs/s: Faded Love, Rewind, GONE

.✦ ݁˖ **Chill Kill**\- Red Velvet

This album is such a masterpiece. Not only is the title track so good and addictive, Red Velvet's b-sides always dive into rnb, which is personally one of my favourite genres.

My favourite songs/s: Iced Coffee, Underwater

.✦ ݁˖  **The Perfect Red Velvet-** Red Velvet

This album is also so good, and the title track, 'Bad Boy', is one of their best. I love the smooth feel of the rest of the album, too. It's such a great one, I heavily recommend.

My favourite songs/s: Perfect 10, Peek-A-Boo, Bad Boy

.✦ ݁˖ **I've IVE**\-IVE 

This album is amazing. I Am was such a perfect title track, and this whole album in general had no skips. It conserved the original elegance of their concept while also diving into more daring songs like Kitchn Blue Blood and Hypnosis, and so many of the songs on there, like Mine, 궁금해 (Next Page), and NOT YOUR GIRL, gave literal girlhood and were bittersweet. It was such an amazing blend.

My favourite songs/s: Lips, Hypnosis, Blue Blood

.✦ ݁˖ **I'VE MINE**\- IVE 

This EP was also so good, oh my gosh. It was able to craft a slow, dreamy song like Off the Record and OTT with the boldness of Baddie, the title track. Either Way was such an emotional representation of their struggles, and Holy Moly ATE DOWNN.

My favourite songs/s: Holy Moly, Off the record, OTT

.✦ ݁˖ **bomb**\- ILLIT 

Oh my gosh, my favourite EP from them, which is crazy because they have zero skips. The way this was such a cutesy, dance anthem EP at first, then transitioned into the dreamyness bamsopoong was so good and subtle. little monster as well was such a good intro, more calm, easy to listen to. jellyous and Do the Dance were so catchy and hyped, and oops was so fun, especially Moka's stage presence during it!

My favourite songs/s: bamsopoong

.✦ ݁˖  **Kill This Love**\- BLACKPINK

This EP was life-changing. They showed a huge range from Kill This Love, to the melancholy dealing of loss of Hope Not and the hopefulness of Kick It, and Don't Know What to Do. This album was so greatly crafted in my opinion, and I'm so glad Kill This Love reached 1b streams!

My favourite songs/s: Kick It, Don't Know What to Do

.✦ ݁˖  **THE ALBUM**\- BLACKPINK

This album was amazing, also taking into consideration that it was their debut album, too. It created a blend of genres that ended up perfectly suiting them, from the swag of How You Like That and Pretty Savage, to the bittersweetness of Lovesick Girls and Love to Hate Me, and the woe in You Never Know. 

My favourite songs/s: Crazy Over You, Lovesick Girls, Love to Hate Me

.✦ ݁˖  **Ruby**\- JENNIE

My favourite solo debut from a K-pop idol EVERRR. This album was soo scrumptious and artistic, it was insane. There was so much thought put into the meaning and production in every song, and so much variety, too, even though it mostly used pop and rnb. Like Jennie, ZEN, Filter ExtraL, Mantra, and Way Up (with the IE), were such empowering songs; then, she blended it perfectly with the smooth sensuality of Damn Right, and Seoul City, before transitioning into the soft rnb of Handlebars, Love Hangover and start a war. Then, the hopefulness of Starlight and FTS, and the sadness of twin.

My favourite songs/s: ZEN, Damn Right, FTS

.✦ ݁˖ **HOT**\- LESSERAFIM

This might be my favourite EP from them, and that's wild because they NEVER miss. The title track HOT, and the way it slowly flowed into Come Over and Ash was insane. They explored the same genre in different fonts and ate down every time. Love them to deathh.

My favourite songs/s: HOT, Ash

.✦ ݁˖ **NewJeans First EP NewJeans**\- NewJeans

This EP was so good, and such an iconic debut, too. The freshness in their music, especially during their debut, paired with their lively concept, was insane. Hype Boy and Attention were hooky and easy to dance to. Cookie was such an interesting song, and Hurt was so bittersweet. I loved it.

My favourite songs/s: Attention, Hurt

1qusbtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobitechies/comments/1qusbtv/fuck_that_girl_im_building_a_bungalow_a_broke/,"Fuck that girl, I'm building a bungalow: a broke developer's Sunday","Sunday. The kind of Sunday where the room feels smaller than it actually is, man.

She's gone. Packed up like she was never there. And I'm sitting in this bedsitter, the same one I told myself was temporary two years ago, staring at the ceiling like it owes me money. No Netflix. I don't even have a subscription, I use pirated sites. No music. Just me and the kind of silence that makes you think too much.

That's when my boy called.

Phone rings like he's been trying for a while. I almost didn't pick up. ""Tony. Tony,"" he calls me. ""There's a bungalow in Kiserian. One bed. We're going. NOW.""

I didn't even ask why. I just said yes. Anything to get me out of that room, man. Anything to stop thinking about her.

So off we go. Kiserian. Me and my boy, we catch a mat from Rongai, 50 bob. That's it. 50 bob to go chase something that might change your life.

We hop in the back of a matatu. Already packed. Smells like the usual, sweat, cheap cologne, someone's chapati. Normal. Then this guy gets in with his kid. Small girl, maybe five. The dad picks her up, sits her down on the seat, then turns to the makanga with that look, the one that says don't even think about it.

""Usijaribu kuweka mtu mwingine kwa hiyo seat, nailipia.""

Makanga just nods. Nobody argues.

And I'm watching this, man. The way he did it, calm. No shouting. No drama. Just quiet authority. The girl just sits there, happy, looking out the window like the world is hers and she's a princess, she got her dad right there. And something in my chest moved. That's the kind of man I wanna be. When I have kids. That guy who doesn't need to raise his voice to make the world stop for a second.

But then the matatu keeps moving and my brain keeps going back to where it doesn't want to go.

My boy's next to me. Quiet for a bit. Then I just say it. Can't hold it in.

""She's gone, bro.""

He looks at me. Doesn't say anything yet. Just waits. That's what boys do, they don't jump in with advice right away. They just... let you talk.

""Three years, man. Three years and she just... gone.""

""What can you do to get her back?"" he asks. Simple question. No judgment.

And I laugh. Not the funny kind. The kind that comes from somewhere deep and tired.

""Nothing. I got no money, bro. That's it. That's the whole story.""

Because that's the truth, man. That's the real truth nobody wants to say out loud. Guys in her DMs right now offering treats, dinner here, trip there, gifts. Meanwhile I'm sitting in a dingy bedsitter where water is always an issue and an M-Pesa balance that makes me close my eyes every time I check it.

Three years. Three years was worth it though. I mean that. She taught me things. She made me feel things I didn't know I could feel and I'm grateful for that. Every moment is for experience. But it's done now. And the only comeback I can have? My own cash. My own grind. That's all that's left.

Why is life like this though, man. Starting from down. No one to look up to. No blueprint. No daddy who left you something. You just wake up one day and the world says ""figure it out"" and that's supposed to be enough.

My boy nods. He gets it. We both come from the same place.

Then he says, casual, like he's quoting scripture, ""As Kibe said... kama huna pesa hufai kudate.""

We both laugh. Actually laugh. The kind where you're hurting but it's funny because it's true. Painfully true. And honestly? The heartbreak is even worth it, man. Looking at it now, sitting here in this matatu with 50 bob spent and nothing but time ahead of me, at least now I'll focus. No more distractions. No more wondering if she's happy. Just me and the grind.

We chat the rest of the way. Just vibing. Boys talk, you know how it is, the journey from Rongai to Kiserian it's nothing amazing to see from the outside. Two guys in the back of a matatu not saying much, half laughing at random things, half staring out the window. But that's where the healing happens, man. Not in therapy. Not in crying alone. Just... this. Two boys and a moving matatu and the road ahead.

We get to Kiserian. Step off the mat and just... stop. Both of us. Standing there like two tourists who accidentally stumbled onto somewhere unknown.

Ngong Hills are visible. Right there. Not on a screen. Not on someone's Instagram. Right there in front of us, green and massive and just sitting there like it's been waiting. The sky is that kind of blue you only see outside Nairobi, man. The real kind.

My boy's looking around, taking it in. Then he turns to me and says, ""Bro... let's stop at a butchery and order half kg of meat. Kiserian is known for that stuff.""

And for a second I'm actually excited. Because yes. Kiserian meat is a whole thing. You can't come here and not eat, that would be a crime, man.

Then reality hits. Like a cold bucket of water right on your face.

I look at my boy. He looks at me. We both know.

""Unakula na pesa gani?"" he says.

And we laugh. Both of us. Proper laugh. The kind where you're slapping your thigh and shaking your head at the same time. Because it's funny. It's actually hilarious. Two guys standing in one of the most beautiful parts of Kenya, Ngong Hills literally breathing in front of them, and they can't even afford a plate of nyama choma.

No money no meat, man. That's the summary of our whole lives right there.

But we haven't reached the bungalow yet. Not even close.

So we flag down a boda. Hop on, me behind my boy and the boda guy riding. Off we go toward St Patrick school. My boy starts chit chatting the boda guy, that's him, always talking, always connecting. Me? I'm behind. Quiet. Just watching.

And bro... just past Kiserian, everything changes.

It's not even a gradual thing. It's immediate. The roads are smooth, like properly done smooth. Not the Nairobi kind where your whole body is a shock absorber. These are clean roads. Tarmac. Good tarmac. And on either side, green. Just green everywhere. Trees. Bushes. Open land. No billboards. No matatu horns. No one shouting. The Ngong Hills view keeps getting better and better the further we go.

And I thought this place was going to be dusty, man. Kajiado vibes, dry, sandy, that kind of thing. But no. Not even close. I'm left in awe.

The air hits my face and it's different. I can't explain it. It's not Nairobi air. Nairobi air is... heavy. You breathe it and you don't even notice because you're used to it. But this? This is the kind of air that makes you actually feel your lungs. Like they've been waiting for this their whole life.

And I'm on this boda, wind coming at me, and I start thinking. Really thinking.

I've always been that guy. The one who says the city is better. Nairobi is where it's at, the hustle, the energy, the connections. I used to say it all the time. ""I'm a young boy, the city is my playground. I can navigate through it bila tatizo."" And I meant it. I believed it.

But sitting on this boda, watching the hills get bigger and the noise get quieter... I think I was wrong, man. I think I was wrong the whole time.

Then the wind picks up.

And it hits my eyes. Hard. The kind that makes them water whether you want them to or not. Tears just start coming, involuntary, burning, the whole thing. And I'm on this boda trying to wipe my face with one hand while holding on with the other like an idiot.

But here's the thing.

It's also a valid reason to cry about her, man. The wind. I can blame the wind. Nobody's going to look at a guy on a boda with watering eyes and think ""oh he's heartbroken."" They'll just think ""ni upepo ya boda."" And for a second, just one second, I let it happen. I let the tears come. Not just from the wind. From everything. From her. From the three years. From the guy in the matatu with his kid and the quiet authority I want to have someday. From the meat we couldn't afford. From the fact that I'm 21 and still figuring out what I'm supposed to be.

The wind took them. I blamed the wind. And that was enough, man.

We reach St Patrick. I get off first. My boy follows, already phone out, making the call. The guy who's supposed to show us the bungalow. He picks up after two rings.

""We're here,"" my boy says. ""St Patrick.""

A pause.

""He's coming to pick us up.""

So we wait. Two guys. No money for meat. Eyes still a little red. Standing by St Patrick school in Kiserian with Ngong Hills now visible so well, clearer than ever, and something in the air that feels like the beginning of something, man. We just don't know what yet.

Then I turn to my boy. Can't hold it.

""Manze... this place. This isn't what I had in mind at all, bro.""

He raises an eyebrow.

""Inakaa much much better than I expected. Like... way better. I could actually hamia huku. I could live here, man.""

He laughs. Proper laugh. Slaps my shoulder.

""Anto wewe ndo husema you wanna stay kwa town. Huelewekangi.""

And I just shake my head, smiling. ""Change of mind. Things happen, bro. This place... it does something to you.""

We stand there for a moment. Both of us looking at the hills. The quiet. The clean air. And for a few minutes it all makes sense, the move, the bungalow, the new life. It's right there. I can almost touch it.

Then my boy says it.

Casual. Like he's just stating the weather.

""But this place favours someone akona gari, Tony. You don't have a gari.""

And there it is.

Reality. Again. Coming back like it never left. Like it was just hiding behind the Ngong Hills the whole time, waiting for the right moment to step out and remind me.

No car. No meat. No money. No her.

I look down at my shoes. Then back up at the hills. Same hills. Same beautiful view. Same clean air. Nothing changed about the place.

Everything changed about me.

What did I do wrong, man. That's the question that keeps coming back. Not ""what should I do next"" or ""how do I fix this."" Just... what did I do wrong. To be here. To be 21. To be standing in one of the most beautiful places in Kenya and still feel like the ground is shaking under my feet.

My boy's quiet now too. He knows. He doesn't need to say anything else.

We just stand there. Waiting for the guy to come pick us up. Two boys by St Patrick school. Broke. Heartbroken. But standing in a place that somehow, for some reason, feels like it's meant for them.

Just not yet, man. Not yet.

The guy shows up like he's been jogging. Slightly out of breath. Daps us up, me first, then my boy. Quick handshake, the kind where you hold it for a second longer than usual because you're strangers pretending you're not.

""Karibu, karibu,"" he says. Smiling. Relaxed. The kind of guy who's done this before, shown people places, read the room, let the property do the talking.

Then my boy does what my boy always does. Starts talking. Engaging. Asking questions. Laughing at something the guy says before the joke is even finished. That's him. That's always been him. People gravitate to him like that, natural, effortless.

Me? I'm behind. Lagging. A few steps back. Spirit low. The whole thing still sitting on my chest like something heavy I can't put down. I'm watching them walk and talk ahead of me and I'm just... here. In my own head. Thinking about her. Thinking about the money. Thinking about everything and nothing at the same time.

But I keep walking. Because that's what men do, man. These are the days that make you stronger. You don't stop walking just because the weight is heavy. You just walk slower. But you walk.

Five minutes. That's what he said. And it felt like twenty.

Then we turn a corner and there it is.

The black gate.

I stop. Not dramatically. Not like in a movie. I just... stop. And I look at it.

And honestly? My first reaction was nothing. Nothing at all.

Because bro, I've been to properties before. Many of them. Kilimani showrooms where the agent is wearing a suit that costs more than my rent. Westlands apartments where the elevator alone makes you feel like you don't belong. Kileleshwa, Lavington, name them all. I've walked through places that looked like they belonged on magazine covers. I've seen the ""executive finishes."" I've seen the glass and the marble and the rooftop views.

So when I saw that gate, my brain said, yeah okay. Another one. Let's see.

We walk through.

And then everything I just said? Gone.

The place is sitting there just calm. Not the fake kind, the real kind. Dark walls. Black. Clean black. And green, everywhere. Banana trees. The whole thing just breathing. Like the place itself is alive and it knows it.

And the quiet, man. It's not Nairobi quiet. Nairobi quiet is just the absence of noise for thirty seconds before a matatu horn breaks it. This is different. This is the kind of quiet where you actually hear birds. Actual birds. Singing. Like they chose this place specifically.

We pull out our gadgets and start taking pictures.

And here's the thing that got me.

The photos. On the screen. The way the place looked through the lens, it looked even more insane than it did with my own eyes. Like the camera was seeing something my brain was still catching up to. I'm scrolling through what I just took and I'm like... bro. This is real. This is actually real.

And my mind starts painting pictures. Not of the place as it is. Of the place as it could be.

Me. Here. A grill right out there by the garden, one of those proper charcoal ones. Nyama choma on a Saturday afternoon. My bros pulling up. A car parked right there, mine. My car. Not a boda. Not a matatu. A car I own, parked in front of a place I own. The Ngong Hills in the background. The air. The quiet. The smoke from the grill mixing with the breeze.

That's a man cave, man. That's the real definition of it. Not a room with a TV and some gaming chairs in some Nairobi apartment. This. This right here. Serenity. Space. Peace. The kind of place where you can actually breathe and think and build something.

Then we walk inside.

Bro.

The living room.

Brown leather sofas, the real kind, not the fake shiny ones that crack after two months. White tiles so clean you're actually scared to step on them. Like, genuinely scared. You look down at your shoes and you're like... I should have washed these before coming here.

The kitchen is right there, open, connected to the living room. And the pendant lights hanging above it, somebody thought about this. Somebody actually sat down and said ""when the sun goes down, how is this going to look?"" And they got it right. Warm light. Soft. The kind that makes everything look golden.

And then.

On the counter.

A coffee machine.

A proper coffee machine. In a 4.7 mil bungalow. Sitting there like it belongs. Like it's been waiting for someone to come in and actually use it every morning before they start their day.

Meanwhile my bedsitter doesn't even have a working tap, man. I have to fill a bucket from the neighbor's tap and carry it up three flights of stairs just to wash my face in the morning.

I just stood there. Hands in pockets. Looking around like I was in a museum. Like if I touched anything it would disappear or someone would come and tell me I don't belong here.

My boy's watching me from across the room. He's not saying anything. He doesn't need to. He knows. He can see it happening, that thing where your brain starts doing math you didn't ask it to do. The kind of math that starts with a number and ends with a dream.

He just stands there. Watching me. Smiling a little.

And says nothing.

Because some moments don't need words, man. Some moments you just have to stand in.

A few minutes pass. Nobody moves. Nobody talks. Just the two of us in this living room with the birds outside and the pendant lights doing their thing.

Then my boy breaks it.

""Anto..."" he says. Casual. Too casual. The kind of casual that means something's coming.

He walks over. Pretends to hand me the keys, just snatches them from the guy's hand for a second, dangles them in front of my face like he's in a comedy skit.

""Shika hii. Ukuwe unaishi hapa.""

And he laughs. That laugh of his, the loud one. The one that fills a room.

He's trolling. Obviously trolling. That's him. Always trolling. Always finding a way to make you laugh when everything is heavy.

But here's the thing.

He put it in my head.

And it stayed.

4.7 million. That number. It just sits there now. In the back of my mind. Not going anywhere.

So I step outside again. Alone this time. Walk into the garden. Stand there. Look up at Ngong Hills, right there, like it was placed on purpose, like someone designed this whole view just for this moment.

The air. Clean. Cool. Like your lungs have been breathing through a dirty cloth your whole life and suddenly someone pulls it off and says ""this is how it's supposed to feel.""

And my brain starts working. Really working. Not the sad kind of thinking. The building kind.

I'm a tech bro. That's what I do. I build things. Apps. Systems. Things that make money if you do them right. And 4.7 million ksh...

Let me convert that.

I pull out my phone. Open the calculator. Type it in.

And I just stare at the number.

That's it. That's the number between me and this place, man. For a tech guy that's... that's one good app. One good contract. One focused year of grinding with zero distractions. Zero heartbreak drama. Zero noise. Just code and the quiet and the Ngong Hills outside my window every single morning.

And my brain starts drawing the blueprint.

One floor up. That's all it takes. I add one floor to this bungalow. Ground floor, I live. Kitchen. Living room. The sofas. The coffee machine. The whole thing. Upper floor, my lab. Screens. Servers. Keyboards. Monitors. Everything. Wake up, pour coffee from that machine downstairs, walk up, sit down, code for 12 hours straight, look out the window at Ngong Hills when my eyes get tired, eat, sleep, repeat. For a year. Maybe two.

No drama. No heartbreak. No matatu noise. No neighbor's tap. No bedsitter ceiling staring back at me. Just me and the grind and the quiet and the hills.

Every tech bro dreams about this, man. The quiet place. The space. The peace to actually build something that matters. Away from everything that's been pulling you down.

I walk back inside. My boy's leaning on the kitchen counter, scrolling his phone. Looks up at me.

I look at him.

""That's like... thirty-six thousand dollars, bro.""

He raises an eyebrow.

I nod.

""That's nothing, man. That's peanuts. One app. One deal. One year of not wasting time on things that don't matter.""

My boy just looks at me for a second. Doesn't laugh this time. Doesn't troll. Just looks at me like he can see something changing behind my eyes.

And maybe he can.

Because something did change, man. Standing in that garden. Looking at those hills. Doing that math.

4.7 million. Thirty-six thousand dollars. One app. One year.

It's not a dream anymore.

It's a plan.

And you know what happens when a boy with nothing to lose starts believing in something? He becomes dangerous, man. The good kind of dangerous. The kind that doesn't make sense to people on the outside. The kind where everyone around you is like ""bro relax, be realistic"" but you're already three steps ahead in your own head.

I'm standing there in that living room. 21 years old. No money. No car. No girl. No working tap. Nothing. Literally nothing.

And for the first time in my life that doesn't feel like a bad thing.

Because a boy with nothing to lose? He's free, man. There's no floor to fall through anymore. You're already there. At the bottom. So the only direction is up. And when you realize that, when it actually clicks, something in you shifts. Something that was sleeping wakes up.

People call it delusion. That's what they'll say. ""Anto is being delusional again."" And yeah. Maybe. At first it is delusion. Pure delusion. A broke boy in a bedsitter in Rongai dreaming about a bungalow in Kiserian with Ngong Hills and a coffee machine and a lab on the second floor.

But here's what nobody tells you about delusion, man.

Sometimes it's the first step before the solution. The delusion comes first. Then the work. Then the reality. That's the order. Nobody builds something by being ""realistic"" from day one. You have to be a little crazy first. You have to see something that doesn't exist yet and believe it will. That's not stupidity. That's how it starts.

I need this place, man.

I said it. Out loud. Just like that. Standing there in the garden with my phone in my hand and pictures of the bungalow filling up my camera roll.

I need this place. I need a car. I need all of it. The good things. Everything. The life that makes sense. The life where you wake up and the first thing you see isn't a cracked ceiling and a bucket of water. The life where you sit down with your coffee, from that machine, that specific machine, and you look out at hills and you think ""I built this. Me. From nothing.""

Because who limits you, man? Who? If it ain't yourself.

That's it. That's the only wall. Not the money. Not the system. Not the economy or the government or whatever people blame when they're still in the same place five years later. It's you. It's the voice in your own head that says ""you can't."" The one that says ""be realistic."" The one that whispers every morning before you even open your eyes.

Fuck that voice.

And fuck that girl, man.

I said it. And it felt good. Not the angry kind. Not the bitter kind where you're sitting in a dark room hating someone. The releasing kind. The kind where you look at the space she left and instead of feeling empty you feel light. Because she was never the plan. She was never going to be the reason I build something. And chasing her, chasing what she wanted, trying to be enough for her, that was the thing slowing me down.

Not anymore.

Fuck that girl. I'm building a bungalow.

My boy's watching me the whole time. He's been quiet for a minute. Then I turn to him and I say it, all of it. The place. The car. The lab. The grind. Everything. Just spitting it out like it's already happening.

And he just nods.

Slowly.

Then smiles.

""Ndo hiyo sasa,"" he says. Simple. Like he's been waiting for me to say it the whole time.

Ndo hiyo sasa. That's it. That's all he needed to say. Because that's what boys do, man. They don't give you a speech. They don't motivate you with some loud, dramatic pep talk. They just... nod. They say ""ndo hiyo."" And that single nod carries more weight than a thousand words.

And I can't stop thinking about it.

So we stay a little longer.

Not because of anything planned. We just... don't leave. Not yet. My boy pulls out his phone, ""bro tustroll tena,"" and we start walking around again. Taking more pictures. More videos this time. Slow ones. The kind where you're not in a rush. The garden. The kitchen. The view from outside. The hills. The gate. The whole thing.

We capture everything like we're documenting evidence. Like if we don't, no one will believe us later. Like we need proof that this place exists. That we were here. That we saw it.

And then, out of nowhere, the dogs.

Two of them. Come trotting from somewhere behind the property like they own the place. Both white, one called Snoopy, I can't remember the other one. Not aggressive. Not barking. Just... curious. Walking up to us like ""who are you two and what are you doing in our garden?""

My boy crouches down immediately. Hand out. Snoopy sniffs it first, takes its time, looks at him like it's interviewing him for a position. Then licks his hand.

""Bro..."" my boy laughs. ""They like us.""

And I'm watching this, two broke boys and two dogs in a garden in Kiserian with Ngong Hills behind them, and something about it feels right, man. Like a scene from someone else's life. The kind of life you see on someone's Instagram and you think ""must be nice."" But here we are. In it. For real.

The dogs follow us around for a few more minutes. Snoopy keeps bumping against my leg like it's trying to tell me something. I crouch down and scratch behind its ears and it just closes its eyes.

""You and me both, bro,"" I tell the dog. ""We both need a home.""

My boy catches that. Doesn't say anything. Just smiles.

We take a few more pictures with them. Stupid ones. The kind you take when you're just happy and you don't care how you look. Then we say our goodbyes, to the dogs, to the place, to the guy who showed it to us.

And we leave.

Walk back to St Patrick. Flag down a bike to Kiserian town, then hop in a matatu. Same way we came. 50 bob back to Rongai.

But everything is different now, man.

The matatu feels smaller on the way back. Nairobi feels louder. The traffic, the horns, the dust, the noise, all of it. Like someone turned the volume up while we were gone. Like the city is testing us. Reminding us where we actually live.

We get to Rongai. My boy daps me up at the stage. ""Ndo hiyo sasa, Tony,"" he says one more time. And walks off toward his place.

And I walk to mine.

Up the stairs. The ones that creak. Past the neighbor's door where the tap works and mine doesn't. Into my bedsitter. The same ceiling. The same small room. The same everything.

I sit down on my bed. Phone in my hand. I open my camera roll and scroll through the pictures. The bungalow. The garden. The dark walls. The coffee machine. The hills. The dogs. All of it, right there on my screen.

4.7 million.

One app. One year.

I lock my phone and put it down. Stare at the ceiling for a long time.

Then I open my laptop.

And I start working.

Because there is a day, man. There is a day where this bedsitter becomes a memory. Where Rongai is just a place I used to pass through. Where 4.7 million is not a dream I had on a Sunday afternoon but a receipt I hold in my hand.

There is a day.

I don't know when. I don't know how exactly. But I know it's coming. I can feel it the same way I felt that air in Kiserian, clean, different, real.

There is a day, man.

I just have to grind until I find it.",7,1770126368.0,nairobitechies,10,0.82,False
1qusbo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenThumbHub/comments/1qusbo2/woodworking_plans_for_beginners/,Woodworking Plans For Beginners,"https://cashflowmanifest.com/woodworking-plans-for-beginners/

Woodworking plans for beginners are essential for anyone looking to dive into the world of woodworking. These plans provide structured, easy-to-follow instructions that can help novices transform a simple piece of wood into a beautiful piece of furniture or décor. With the right set of plans, beginners can learn the basics of measuring, cutting, and assembling wood pieces while gaining confidence in their skills.

To get started, woodworking plans for beginners often include projects such as birdhouses, simple shelves, or even a basic coffee table. These projects not only allow beginners to practice different techniques but also offer a sense of accomplishment once completed. Look for plans that specify materials, tools needed, and step-by-step instructions, which are crucial for successful project execution.

When searching for woodworking plans, consider the following tips:

*   **Skill Level:** Ensure the plans are labeled for beginners to avoid frustration.
*   **Tools:** Use plans that align with the tools you have or are willing to acquire.
*   **Materials:** Look for plans that utilize readily available materials.
*   **Community Feedback:** Choose plans with positive reviews and comments from fellow beginners.

Furthermore, many online resources provide woodworking plans for beginners, often accompanied by helpful videos and tutorials. These platforms can enhance learning and motivate budding woodworkers. Engaging with communities, whether online forums or local workshops, can also provide valuable advice and support during your woodworking journey.

I am 41f, my fiance (we will call him Rob) is a 43m. We have been together for 7 years, and engaged for... a long time.

I am very Dave-oriented finance wise. I have a house that I owe 120k on that's worth about 275k, and Rob lives there with me, and no other debt. I am doing my best to save amply for retirement, although I'm quite a bit behind as I got a late start.

Rob has... a lot of shit. He is essentially a hoarder. He has a house that he also owes some money on, and he is renting out to his family member. In the seven years that I've known him, he has ""collected"": a large fishing boat that is sitting in his yard, another boat that I have no idea where it's located, a warehouse in some random town that is FULL TO THE BRIM of random machinery that he bought at auction, several vehicles that are scattered about (including one ""vintage"" one that is sitting in my garage that hasn't seen the sunlight in several years), a plot of land in a neighboring city that he has never even mowed the lawn at, not to mention the basement at his house is ABSOLUTELY FULL of stuff. He doesn't owe any money on this stuff though as far as I know. 

The only thing I have ever seen him sell was one of his cars, once. That's it. In seven years. Despite his reason for ""collecting"" is to sell all this stuff at a profit.

Here's where the problem comes in.

Rob doesn't like living in my house, and he has located a very nice plot of land that he wants us to build a house on. This is kind of a rare piece of property so I understand the appeal.

Here's the problem: we can't buy it in cash. Basically, he wants us to take out a mortgage on a property that I GUARANTEE will sit there collecting dust JUST LIKE ALL OF HIS OTHER SHIT.

I know that we have to get married before we do this, but I'm second guessing this. I am NOT a hoarder. I host semi-annual garage sales. I have one car. If I buy a new coffee table, I sell my old one on Facebook instantly. I go to Platos Closet frequently and sell my clothes and shoes if I haven't worn them in six months.

This is a financially incompatible arrangement. The problem is, I love Rob dearly, but I know that financial incompatibility is the biggest reason for divorce. He bought me a VERY EXPENSIVE ring and I feel awful about it.

I do not want to get into this arrangement until he proves himself to be able to finish his projects. SELL SOMETHING FOR GODS SAKE. I'm having a very very hard time finding the right words or the right solution to this.

He is all gung-ho over this piece of land and I don't want to shatter his dreams and I know he hates living in my house but I don't know what to do.",4,1770126335.0,DaveRamsey,12,1.0,False

we arrive next week at SJO and spend the first two days in Alajuela, before visiting places like Monteverde, La Fortuna, Tortuguero and Puerto Viejo. 

We planned to do day trips from Alajuela, one would be Volcano Poas, but the path there is still closed, so we are looking for alternatives. We don´t have a rental car - so sights like Braulio Carrillo or Frogs Heaven might be not worth the expensive drive. 

We thought about Doka Coffee Tour and/or a San Jose Walking Nature Tour (https://www.viator.com/tours/San-Jose/Looking-for-Sloths-butterflies-and-birds-in-the-Urban-Jungle/d793-158476P1) worth it? 

La Paz Waterfalls are not really what we are looking for, regarding the reviews with a lot of animals in not so suitable cages or facilities. 

Has someone any other ideas managable with public transport or an Uber so not so far away?

Most of my money is going straight into the apartment itself, so I’m trying to find the most budget-friendly way to make this move happen. I don’t have a ton of furniture, but enough that carrying everything by hand isn’t super realistic.

Does anyone have advice for super short-distance moves on a tight budget?

1qus6m4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qus6m4,Cold Brew with Coconut Cream (Jeni's),"**Jeni's review No. 8:** I wish it weren’t 33 degrees out when I tried this one because it feels like a refreshing treat in the July heat. I don’t have much love for icy sorbet or granita, so I worried the clash of textures might not be my thing. But having lived dangerously mixing sherbet and ice cream in a recent orange cream flavor, I thought: Why not? I ended up being pleasantly surprised by how well they mesh, though I could see some people hating the combo. In my first tasting it looked like a heavy coconut cream to cold brew ratio, but it ended up being top heavy, with the sorbet angled in, so you get more coffee as you dig deeper and they end up being about equal measures. You might need to scoop strategically to get both on your spoon at the same time.

**What I liked:** The coffee flavor is delicious and really pops in a different way than normal coffee ice cream.

**What could be better:** Maybe a ribbon of espresso caramel to break up the large sections of coconut cream?

**Non-dairy vs dairy:** I think this works well as a non-dairy offering.

**Better than the namesake drink?** I’ve never had a cold brew with coconut cream, but this flavor reminds me of a fun Starbucks summer drink icy cold from the blender.

**How it compares:** This is a unique combination, so it’s hard to compare. Talenti has Cold Brew Sorbetto, which has gotten good reviews. If they had used ice cream instead of sorbet here it would sort of remind me of the Van Leeuwen Coffee Affogato, which I also enjoy.

**Possible pairing:** Cold brew and caramel are a nice match, so maybe Jeni’s Salty Caramel or another brand’s version? 

**Final thought on the Jeni’s dairy-free line:** I enjoyed getting to know coconut cream flavors. Its texture is lovely. Jeni often uses it like Ben & Jerry and its Sweet Cream — easy to adapt by tossing in different mix-ins. The challenge I find is if the base isn’t manipulated enough — like it was in Peppermint Patty to taste like mint —it has too much coconut flavor to work like an invisible sweet cream, but paradoxically is not as flavorful as a good coconut ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs Pineapple Coconut). Jeni’s might want to look at other ways the coconut can disappear or do a couple of flavors that  highlight it —macaroon or coconut cake? Or a painkiller with coconut-spiced rum base and orange-pineapple swirl? That’s one, like this Cold Brew flavor, that would be most welcome on a scorching day.

I have used Whiskey Barrel aged from Harley and Frozen Cherry from Barbara earlier. Currently, using the Honey Sun Dried from Barbara again, bought it from Toffee Coffee roasters. However, I am facing an issue with water clogging, especially at the end.

I have the C3S grinder. Earlier, I had set it to 15 clicks with a 1:14 ratio for 15 gm coffee and it worked great. I consistently had a brew time of approx 2:40 with both beans and used to get a full bodied flavour which I love.

But now with the honey dried beans, I notice water gets clogged and it takes more than 3:30 to brew. It takes 1 minute for the water to drain from approx 5mm above the coffee bed. I tried increasing the size, took it to 16 clicks and nothing seems to change. My pour rate is same as earlier and do a total of 3 pours including bloom. In fact, even without changing anything, I see different brew times across pours. The flavour is obviously inconsistent as well.

Anyone has any idea what's going wrong?

I got a Eureka Mignon Silenzio 55 for Christmas this year, love the product.  However about 30 days in she got clogged and stopped grinding, I had to disassemble and clean out the shoot.  I thought ""30 days seems like a short window for this thing to get clogged"".  2-3 weeks later, it happens again!  My coffee isn't overly oily or anything, seems pretty dry actually.  But there are a lot of ""tight spaces"" inside the mechanism for the grounds to get clogged.  Looking to hear others' experience and cleaning routine for this grinder?  I've never had to disassemble a grinder every couple of weeks to clean, seems off.

My DD is turning 5 in April and in public school now, my son is turning 2 this month. It's so hard for me to get to work by 8:30 every morning, and sometimes I need to leave early because someone fell and has a bump or a fever. DD is in public school now, and I'm lucky to have my mom be able to pick her up at 2:45 (afternoon care starts in Kindergarten), but she is also caring for my elderly grandmother with dementia, and has her own health problems. Sometimes the weather just stinks and I don't want her out in it, so I need to leave early. 

My boss is understandably annoyed, but it's not like I don't get my work done, and I always put my hours on my timesheet... Still, no coming back from that. If they don't understand, they never will. And that's fine, they're the boss. I try my best, but it's not working out.

  
Every one of the ladies I work with have kids a little younger than me, so they're in their late 50's and early 60's. They all worked part-time, 9-2 when their kids were in school. I'm not even sure those magical jobs exist anymore, lol. I wish my job had a couple of WFH days, but they do not have that capability, even in an emergency. 

My boss said something to me yesterday as I was heating up my bfast and it made me cry at my desk until my head started hurting so badly. I wasn't sobbing but the tears wouldn't stop falling no matter how I tried to distract myself, so I got some work done and I left early after getting too nauseous to stay, sooo dramatic I know, but I wasn't trying to make a spectacle of myself. I've never had a headache that bad before.

I just looking for solid chat friends. People to write with during random moments like when you’re having a good day, a weird day, or just one of those evenings where you feel like talking to someone who isn’t part of your daily routine.

**What I’m hoping for**

	•	Friendly conversation (short messages are fine, longer messages are welcome)

	•	A bit of consistency (no pressure, but not “one day and gone” either)

	•	Someone who can talk about everyday things *and* sometimes deeper stuff

	•	Respectful vibes. No drama, no “prove your worth” energy

**About me**

	•	27M, from Germany

	•	I’m a calm, grounded person

	•	I like nature and being outside (especially when I can clear my head)

	•	I’m into hobbies and projects that keep me busy, but I also appreciate slow days

**Topics I can talk about endlessly**

	•	Daily life, routines, habits, small wins, random thoughts

	•	Food & coffee

	•	Outdoors / nature / calm hobbies

	•	Games and general internet culture

	•	Personal goals or motivation

	•	“Tell me about your life” type of chats, I genuinely like people’s stories

**If you don’t know what to write, here are easy starters:**

	•	What’s something you’ve been obsessed with lately (song, game, show, hobby)?

	•	What’s your comfort routine when your day is annoying?

	•	What’s a random opinion you have that you could defend for 10 minutes?

	•	If you could instantly get good at one skill, which one and why?

If you’re also looking for a new chat friend and you’re the type who likes honest, chill conversation — message me.

Tell me a bit about you, where you’re from, and what kind of chats you enjoy. If you want, add one topic you’d love to talk about. 😊

I know how overwhelming it can be to plan a trip to the Arctic - balancing Northern Lights tours, fjord cruises, and figuring out if you actually have time for that reindeer visit.

To make things easier, just launched a completely free Trip Planner on [Trip Planner](http://tromso-app.com/trip-planner) . My goal was to move away from messy notes and spreadsheets into something that actually works on a phone while you're standing in the snow.

**What you can do with it:**

**Ready-made Templates**: If you don’t know where to start, you can pick a template like ""Aurora Weekend"" or ""Arctic Adventure"" and customize it.

**Day-by-Day Planning:** A simple drag-and-drop timeline to organize your activities (1 to 14 days).

**Interactive Maps:** It visualizes your route with numbered markers, so you can see if your morning coffee is actually near your afternoon museum.

**Weather Integration:** It shows forecast badges directly inside your timeline to help you plan around the conditions.

**Sharing & Collab**: You can invite friends to edit the trip with you or just send them a view-only link.

**Offline Access:** You can export your whole plan to a PDF for printing) or to your Calendar (ICS).

Why it’s different? It's built specifically for Tromsø. It’s super fast on mobile, and the ""Fill my day"" option can auto-populate ideas if you're feeling stuck. No subscriptions, no ""premium"" locks - just a tool to help you enjoy the North.

I’d love to hear what you guys think! If you're currently planning a trip, give it a spin and let me know if there’s any specific feature you’d like to see added.

Should I remove this wall art to make the space look more premium?,"I’m opening a small cacao / coffee bar that’s connected to a jiu-jitsu and wellness space in the north coast, beach town of Dominican Republic. The brand is very minimal, grounded, and intentional while expressing premiumness.

I gave the artist a lot of creative freedom on this wall, and I respect the work he did. Now that the whole space is coming together, I’m wondering if removing the art and keeping the orange lime-wash wall empty would make it feel cleaner and more premium.

I don't mind it so much specially because a wooden board will come across the flowers to place mugs and cups. It could add some character to the wall. And with time I can get to enjoy it I feel. But my business partner is definitely not into the idea. He believes it removes all the premium feel from the brand.

The logo on the left is the brand's logo and we want that to stay, we're wondering if the flowers behind the bar go with it.

I’m struggling because asking to remove it feels like asking him to undo his work and take some more time.  
From a design perspective only: **does the art elevate the space, or does a clean lime-wash wall fit the brand better?**

Also, the logo has some shadow that when is daytime and you're super close to the logo, you can't tell is a shadow but it just looks like an outline. But when you look at a darker time and you see from further, it looks even kinda tripy. This is also something my business partner hates the whole shadow effect and says that ''eyeballs don't have a shadow'' So why is there a shadow on the eyeball.  
In my eyes (no pun intended). Art is art, and everything is allowed.

I asked my brand designer and he also suggested removing the flowers and just putting a white wall with a shelf horizontally in the middle. (shelf will be there regardless)

Someone in reddit said I should remove the logo. I mocked up some AI versions of the adviced.

I'm leaning more towards the white wall with the shelf but I'm an athlete, not an interior designer haha.

My brand is a Jiu Jitsu brand, Acai bowls and cacao/coffee are extra. But I want people to be excited to come to this by itself too!

There is no assigned reading, and it’s bring your own book.

Called the Silent Book Club, the one in Columbia is among a growing number of these reading groups worldwide that have become alternatives to the chatty clubs where everyone reads the same book and offers up their opinions.

If the typical book club is for extroverts, then silent book groups are directed to introverts.

At least 1 million readers around the globe in 2,000 chapters and more than 55 countries — 1,200 in the United States alone — belong to a silent book club, according to the group website. They meet online and in person to read together, and they happily welcome newcomers.

Meeting to read quietly

The Silent Book Club in Columbia meets in the public library at 6 p.m. on the last Tuesday of every month. They read for an hour in the Quiet Reading Room on the third floor.

The most recent meeting was Tuesday, on a brutally cold, snowy night, which meant the group was smaller than usual. Only six, including the librarian overseeing the meeting.

It began with the same ice-breaker that starts every meeting: What are you reading?

Jennifer Gravley was reading “The God of the Woods” by Liz Moore on her Kindle, the No.1 pick by People magazine for 2024.

The woman across from her gasped. She had brought the same book.

Apparently a boost in popularity and sales for the book was prompted when Taylor Swift mentioned reading it during a TV airing of her Eras Tour docuseries.

Matt Dube said he was reading “Theo of Golden,” a bestseller by Allen Levi about a mysterious stranger who arrives in a Southern city.

Jacob Polley brought his mother’s old copy of Stephen King’s “The Shining,” remarking that it was his first time to attend the meeting.

“Based on the copyright date, I think she was like 14 or 15 (when she bought it),” Polley said.

When the timer started to tick down the hour, all six readers settled into their books, knees crossed, lips tight, brows furrowed.

The book club deliberately encourages the readers to slow down in a space where they will never need to fold a page corner to address a distraction or let the dog out.

“It’s just a protected time and space that has its own energy,” Gravley said. “I love that. You can’t feel guilty that you’re not cleaning out your closet.”

How it began

In 2017, Columbia librarian Kat Stone Underwood caught a mention of silent book clubs on Facebook. The library has been an official member of the global organization ever since.

Members meet in libraries, cafes and even bars, creating a type of local community that is increasingly scarce.

“No one’s playing on their phone, and there’s no music in the background,” Underwood said. “Just the time to really settle in and experience whatever you’re reading.

“You’re able to carve out an hour to just read whatever you want, no interruptions. And I think that’s really rare in today’s society,” she added.

Members are often attracted to the club because of its casual nature — there’s no added stress of hurrying to finish an assigned book.

“I gave up homework a long time ago,” Polley said.

The book club attracts all kind of readers, Underwood said.

“Some people only read nonfiction, and others only read fantasy. One person read through all the presidents’ biographies in order.”

About a half-dozen core members of the book club are regulars, with a few new faces every month. It’s mostly geared toward adults, but Underwood said everyone is welcome, and parents often bring their older children.

She has seen friendships blossom over the years. When a meeting is over, members will help put away chairs, grab another complimentary cup of coffee, walk each other out and even make plans to hang out.

“I think part of the magic of a silent book club is you can come as you are with whatever you’re reading, and we have a space for you,” she said.

As the hour for silent reading wound down, members shared other books they’ve read. Underwood said she always walks away from a meeting with a new list.

The Feb. 24 meeting will be held in the Friends Room at the library and will return to the Quiet Reading Room from March forward.

“It’s a really great book club for people who don’t fit into the traditional book club mold,” Underwood said.",8,1770125421.0,columbiamo,0,0.9,False

My blood pressure and heart rate spiked from 111/73 mmHg to 145/96 mmHg. I stopped it and started taking Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine); after three days, it affected me at a similar intensity. I do not have tachycardia—my resting heart rate is 65 bpm—but both Medikinet and Elvanse raised it to approximately 100 bpm. I do not have hypertension, nor does anyone in my family. I have a very healthy heart; I have undergone multiple cardiac tests, all of which confirmed optimal cardiovascular health. Additional tests—including LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and numerous other biomarkers—were all within excellent ranges. My psychotherapist diagnosed me with ADHD and depression. While on these medications, I experienced severe physical side effects such as dizziness, headaches, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, tinnitus, head pressure, and shortness of breath. Nevertheless, I observed that some of my ADHD symptoms improved despite these adverse effects. This raises a critical question: why does my body react to stimulants so intensely? I smoked for 15 years and recall that heavy smoking sometimes triggered headaches at the back of my head. I also experience anxiety and tinnitus when consuming coffee. Given that stimulants are often said to ""calm"" individuals with ADHD, why do they produce the opposite effect in me? If ADHD were simply caused by insufficient dopamine, why would introducing dopamine/norepinephrine into my nervous system cause anxiety and physiological hyperarousal rather than calmness? Interestingly, on two occasions while taking Medikinet XL 10 mg (ingested at 8:30 AM), I experienced pronounced calmness around 1:30 PM—approximately five hours post-ingestion—a state I had never previously encountered.?

Because A&B was hit so hard with negative publicity I can see them not wanting people to know it’s them. But you just can’t ignore the timing, similarities and name. 

Personally I think the Merc should have been branded and named something you could relate to Joie Inn, but they went in a total opposite direction.  Jo Coffee, if the Petrone’s definitely have, does have the same feel as the Inn. 

Need some local info!  Since the Petrone’s moved to TN I bet they didn’t do a non compete. Not that it would matter .. who cares if they have a coffee trailer.

1qurp2m,https://i.redd.it/hyj2zayj5ahg1.jpeg,Having to constantly fight for my boundaries is exhausting...,"It pains me to have to resort to this stuck on my door after my verbal communication of it keeps getting ignored by my partner. 

I (36/f) am an Autistic person with ADHD and anxiety. No matter what I've tried to do to explain to my partner (42/m) about how I feel, he doesn't listen or jumps straight to Invalidation and blame shifting to imply that his needs are more important.

He knows I get overstimulated easily, especially after a big day for me. A big fay for me usually involves some type of social responsibility or requirement that I have to force myself to do such as Dr appointments, family outings for celebrations,other community appointments or responsibilities or something outside of my control that is stressful, such as unplanned or unexpected situations.
After those things I'm ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED. I've explained to him how I feel both physically and mentally drained which depending on the situation, can take me days or even weeks to recover from. I've sent him resources and articles and I've explained in my own words numerous times. 
I feel that I'm always Invalidated, dismissed or minimised every time I try to communicate my boundaries.

For example, the other night I was lying in my bed and he came up to my bedroom door (yes i had to make a seperate space/bedroom in my craft room in order to have somewhere I could get away from overstimulating sensory issues and just to have a place I could feel free to do what I please and relax).
Anyway, he knocks on my door while I'm half asleep and says ""I can't find the cat, she's missing"" this sends me into panic/anxiety mode and rushes me with emotion. 
I start asking questions because at this point I can't even get out of bed. I ask ""what do you mean you can't find her!?! Have you looked ...*start naming her regular hiding spots* he says he did and has been looking extensively for at least 10 minutes. (I found that hard to believe because we live in a small house and didn't hear him calling her name or anything, but I didn't say anything about that part) Then he just WALKED AWAY! I started having to yell out to him suggestions like try shaking her biscuits or turning on her favourite interactive toy. 
He didn't return or reply for 5- 8 minutes so I dragged myself out of bed to help look and there he is holding her. I was like wtf!?? Why didn't you yell out that you found her or come back and let me know straight away!? 
He said ""I didn't think you cared because you didn't even get up to help me look"" 
Am I crazy or is that a completely wild thing to assume!? At this point I got upset and went back to my room, exhausted and fully awake now, I couldn't get back to sleep until 4am. i kind of feel like he wanted my attention, so did the bare minimum to find her, just so I'd react or stand to attention to his commands. (Is this wrong to assume?, because after everything....that's how I'm starting to feel about his behaviour. That he likes when I react and he can control me)

Anyway three night ago I had had another big day. I had to get a blood screen test to test my levels for various things which also involved me having to fast. So I was not allowed ANYTHING but water for 8-12 hours the day before my test. I hate needles and was freaking out so I only got 4 hours sleep the night before. After getting my test in the morning, I also had to go to a cafe for lunch with my family for my brothers birthday. I was famished so I ate a HUGE meal and had 2 coffees.
When we got home I went to my room to try and catch up on some much needed rest. My partner approached my an hour later and knocked on my door. (I literally cringe everytime I know it's him now, because of what happens every time)
He said ""I'm thinking about báo buns for dinner, what do you want?"" 
I wasn't really hungry after my big late lunch meal but I tried to give him an answer because he's said I'm difficult and never answer his questions properly in the past.
 I misunderstood what he was asking because I thought he was saying he wanted báo buns and I could choose what I wanted??? Otherwise why would he ask, right!? So I said ""ummm... I could go a sushi rice bowl I guess"" he replied with ""well I don't feel like a rice bowl because I don't want the carbs."" (He's trying to eat healthier, which I admire, as I eat much healthier options than him most of the time) 
Although his answer confused me... He just asked me what I wanted for dinner, now he's saying he doesn't want what I chose??? I finally think I understood what he was thinking so I said to him ""Can't you just have what you want...and I get what I want?"" Like why do we have to eat the same thing?, I don't understand why you'd ask me what I want to eat if I don't get a choice because it's not what you want?"" 
He said ""well I suggested Baô buns and you didn't want them!?""

I was SO CONFUSED I LITERALLY GOT SO UPSET and overstimulated on TOP of my overstimulation from my stressful day. I just ended up telling him that I wasn't hungry anyway and to just get what he wants. I told him I try to communicate with him but I feel like my answers are always wrong or dismissed by him which makes me feel overwhelmed and interrogated. I said it shouldn't be this hard or complicated to make choices together! 

He then said that because I wasn't hungry that it's not ""normal"" becaus eeveryone eats dinner. I told him that's just not true, and many people don't eat dinner sometimes, especially if they aren't hungry. 

We just kept arguing in circles until I exploded and screamed  for him to go away and leave me alone. 

Well after that, tonight, he approached me again and knocked on my door yo ""make an appology"". I was sceptical already and had my walls and gaurd up high. He started off by saying that he thinks the other night went badly because we BOTH miscommunicated with each other. His solution was for me to tell him I'm overstimulated next time and I need time to answer him.

To me that wasn't the issue at all?? I felt like the issue was that he approached me KNOWING how my day was already stressful for me, then asked me a question and when I answered, didn't accept it?? And then said a bunch of unempathetic stuff to me afterwards. I reminded him also that I can't always tell him I'm overstimulated....because I'm overstimulated....and I've explained to him why this happens before.. 
I also pointed out that I DID ask him to come back later and give me time to settle down and he said he HAD to ask and get his answer now because all the shops shut in a few hours. 

I just don't know how to keep living in this relationship/situation. I keep having hope that one day I'll be understood but I think there's no way that will ever happen. It's hard enough for me living my life...than to have to overload myself with someone elses issues, when they aren't able or willing to understand me.

Sorry for the long post. There's way more but that's all I can put right now...😩

He distorted and manipulated my sense of reality, all the while proclaiming to value me and my emotional safety. What a fucking mind fuck. 

I told him in the beginning that I was uncomfortable by their connection and said that boundaries need to be set if we are to move forward with our relationship. He lied to me and said she was just a ""professional sounding board"" but agreed that boundaries needed to be set and interactions limited to work. 

He then proceeded to lie about it and deny it over and over again for months and months. He was cagey and dismissive whenever I mentioned her. At that time we were temporarily long distance too. When I brought it up, that something isn't adding up... it led to an entire month of conflict. And even during this time he still sent her video messages and voice memos and memes, showing off his accomplishments, bringing her coffee and snacks, seeking her attention outside of work, hitting her up out of the blue in his own personal time, sending pictures of the sunset, sending songs, emotionally supporting her, sending 😘🥰 emojis, subtly and overrtunf flirting, telling her she reminded him of his ex/mother of his child (????), going out of his way for ""hugs"" (i.e ""can i still get that hug?"").... while attempting to ""repair"" things with me by telling me that things were ""cold between them, limited to basic workplace pleasantries, hellos & goodbyes, and basic surface level chats at work"". 


He lied and lied and lied about it up in the very end when I asked to their messages, after which he could not lie or manipulate or deflect from the reality of what occurred. He told me i could see the messages and that he had ""nothing to hids"" and yet gave me very limited time, repeatedly tried to disrupt the process, distract me, etc. As far as I know, nothing happened between them physically beyond hugging while we were together, but who fucking knows at this point. 

It was inappropriate and grossly blurred professional and personal boundaries.

Everything is fine.,"I’m writing this from the hospital. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know if it was the electric shock or the drugs, but I have to tell someone about this. It wasn’t a dream. My brain is still super scattered from the pain meds from my “incident”, and the hospital has given me a bunch of stuff as well. I’m going to try and explain what happened as best as I can remember. I need someone, anyone, to know that this wasn’t a dream.

Last night, I got a call to tow a truck that didn’t exist. Or at least, I couldn’t find it. The dispatcher gave me coordinates, which was super weird, but I could not find this stupid truck. I gave up and started driving back to the shop, but the pain meds made me black out for a second, and I had a weird dream, then I went to sleep in the sleeper cab. I thought I passed out on the side of the highway, but when I woke up this morning, I was only about 10 miles from the shop. I got woken up by a cop who was banging on the door.

Ok, I’ve rewrote this next part over and over again, but I think I need to just tell it how I saw it.

So, last night, when I thought I blacked out, I don’t think I actually did. I was driving down the highway, and the lights did go all weird and shiny and the road started to like, shift, between being a gravel trail, open desert, asphalt, and this weird metal-looking material. It kept changing where it was going, sometimes it was straight, sometimes it curved left or right or split into a ""y"", or an intersection or something else. But it was all of those things at once. I kept driving because I knew I was close to my exit, but the street signs were all jumbled. The road names and exit numbers were scrambled together, and sometimes the sign was old, sometimes it looked brand new, and sometimes it looked like it was floating or hovering. But they were all overlaid on top of each other. I know, I feel insane just typing this. I didn’t want to stop, I just wanted to get back to the shop and go home. The GPS was glitching out and going crazy, like it had loaded a bunch of different maps all on top of each other. I still didn’t have cell signal, so I couldn’t use maps on my phone. But I knew I was close, I just had to get home.

I drove for what felt like way longer than it should’ve been, and then the fuel light came on on the dash. I thought the truck was full when I left the shop, but I guess I misread the gauge. I knew I was close to home, but I didn’t want to run the truck out of fuel. I didn’t want to be stuck here. I just wanted to get home. I drove until I was scared the truck was going to die, then I picked a random exit and pulled over. I thought I’d driven off the road at first, because the ground disappeared for a second and turned into straight dirt. I saw a little town just down the road and drove to it. I don’t remember the name of the town. The sign was all mixed up and the words were running together. But there was a gas station not too far from the freeway, so I pulled in there. My head was killing me, so I took one more pain pill just to take the edge off. I just needed to get fuel so I could get home.

I’ve never been on a drug trip or high before, but it was making everything look like it was moving in slow motion, like one of those scenes in a movie where everybody is moving around, and you can see the path of where they are going and where they came from. I didn’t want anyone to think I was out of it and call the cops, so I tried to look as normal as I could. I got the truck pulled up to the pump without hitting anything. Thankfully the company credit card actually worked there. A lot of times, in smaller towns, they won’t take the card and then you have to find another gas station. Luckily, they took the company card here, so I was able to fill up. I needed a receipt, but it wouldn’t print out at the pump, I had to go inside.

I just put my head down and tried to walk without falling over. I kept bumping into people, and I know they thought I was crazy, but it was like I could only see them out of the corners of my eye. If this is what a drug trip feels like, I’m never getting high again. So, I know you’re not supposed to buy anything else but gas with the company card, but I was desperate. I’d kicked caffeine since I puked the other day, but I could barely keep my eyes open, and it felt like I was going to pass out at any moment. I bought two energy drinks, chugged one before I even got to the counter. So, I get up to the counter, and the cashier looks like he’s moving in fast forward. He’s working the register, grabbing cigarettes, sweeping the floor, like he was doing a hundred things at once. I didn’t want to interrupt, but I finally asked him for the receipt. He printed it and held it out, but I guess I was moving super slow because he just dropped it on the counter and went back to whatever he was doing. I wish I could get the security camera footage from the gas station because I probably looked like a meth zombie or something.

I just needed to get home. I don’t know what it was about the freeway, or maybe it was just because the lights are brighter there than they were in town, they kept giving me a really bad headache. I took two more of the pain pills so I could see straight. By the time I finally got back to the shop, my watch said that it’d been about six hours since I left the shop. I burned through another tank of fuel somehow. I probably drove the truck all the way back in the first box or something. Anyway, so I parked the truck and walked back to my apartment. I didn’t even want to try and ride my bike.  I barely remember making it home, I was in a complete daze. I think I fell asleep on my couch. I don’t really remember anything after I parked the truck and started walking home.

I woke up in the sleeper cab of the tow truck. A cop was banging on the driver’s side door and yelling. I opened the door and totally expected him to drag me out of the cab. He didn’t, though. He just looked at me, like I haven’t ever seen anyone look at me before. Like he was scared, but not for himself. I don’t know how to explain it. I wasn’t on the side of the freeway, though, where I thought I fell asleep. I was down the street from the shop, maybe a couple miles. Anyway, the cop called an ambulance for me, even though I tried to deny treatment, or whatever it’s called. 

He called an ambulance anyway. The rest of this happened in a swirly daze. I think I was coming down off the pain meds. He kept asking me questions, but I don’t remember any of them. I don’t remember if I answered or now. I remember being lifted onto a stretcher, then I blacked out again. I woke up in the hospital. The doctors told me that it looked like I’d been awake for almost three days. It kinda felt like it. I had the worse case of cotton mouth and I was so hungry. They wouldn’t let me eat, though. They needed to do a ton of scans and take a lot of blood, and I guess you have to do that on an empty stomach. I’m so fucking hungry.

I think I heard the cop tell the doctor about the pills. I had to pee in a cup, and I’m pretty sure they only do that if they’re testing for drugs. I’m pretty sure everything else they can just use blood. My prescription is at home, but I know they’ll see it in the system. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to get in trouble, even if I pop for them, because I’m not taking anything other than what they gave me. They said that everything points to an accelerated heart rate and a heightened metabolism. They said that high caffeine can make you super dehydrated. I forgot that I’d drank a bunch of coffee before I left home, and I drank one of those little energy bottle things on my way to the shop. They said that much caffeine plus the kind of pain meds they have me on can make you have super lucid dreams, and make your body go into overdrive. 

I don’t know. I don’t know why I fell asleep on the side of the highway and woke up next to the shop. I know you can blackout from alcohol, but you’re still awake. Your brain just doesn’t remember what you did. Can pain meds make you do that? Did I try to drive the truck home and almost made it? I really hope I don’t get a DUI. I just gotta do that interview next week. Or this week, I think. I gotta check my calendar. But I think it’s next week. I just need to nail that interview. Working almost every night can’t be healthy. 

I'm going to be ""under observation"" for the rest of the day, but I think they'll let me out tomorrow. ",1,1770124471.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

First of all the Nitropress is far easier to use, far easier to clean, with a result that is on par with commercial level nitro coffee.

For someone that is just looking for a single glass of nitro coffee in the morning, this is perfect. And if it’s a daily thing, you probably do want to invest in the electric version but I’m going to stick with the cartridges for now. Flavor is excellent, texture is excellent.  

I like that you can also use this on other beverage types like cocktails, and the cartridges are standard small sized N2 2g cartridges so you could also use other brands, or CO2 for other beverages.

She called yesterday and tried to blame the incident on me, though it was going to happen one day or another anyway: the child was climbing his dresser and it fell. It did not fall on him, but he got a concussion. He was in his room with my son trying to get something from the top of the dresser.

It was terrible. I ran to him and called her immediately. Two days later she calls me and accuses me of causing the whole thing because I stopped in while I was dropping her other kids off from a birthday party, and her 22 year old was supposed to be watching the five year old. 

I told her she was wrong for accusing my son and I for causing the accident; her response was I told you “another time” via text when I asked if we could stop by when dropping off the kids. \[Long story short, I thought she meant I could see her (the adult) another time and did not get that she did not want us to stop in.\]

The conversation continued and she accused me of acting bipolar and tried to blame my behavior on my disorder rather than agreeing that I misunderstood. She also went on and asked me if I remembered what I said to her during my psychotic episode that got me diagnosed last year. I went silent, and let her fumble her way through the rest of the conversation solo. Finally, she stopped word vommiting, and I ended the conversation coldly and wished her son good health.

She wants me to still have coffee with her every Friday and help her with her grad school work. I did not respond to that text. I am angry! I do remember everything I said to my family while psychotic; I was evil and manipulative, but that was not me! 

It is a very tough situation because I feel for her; her kid did get a concussion, but I also need to take care of me, and I don’t want to spend time with people that think episodes are out of my control. I have gotten help. I am in control. Mania is not some drug to relapse into, and psychosis is scary as F.

The only urgent item for today is going to the gym. I would have never realized that without the below analysis.*

Go to the gym at lunch. Strong candidate bc:

* I've missed several workouts lately due to low evening energy
* It's something I enjoy
* It makes me feel good during/after
* It's something I would want to do if today is all I have

Clean coffee maker is good ""if idle"" candidate bc:

* Is long overdue, even according to my very low standards
* Involves hygiene related to something I ingest into my body daily
* Improves taste

Empty/clean dishwasher. Good ""if idle"" candidate bc:

* Good timing bc convenient to do between cycle completion and needing to load dirty dishes
* Otherwise, I'll need to partially handwash dishes bc poor dishwasher performance

Change guitar strings. Good ""if idle"" candidate bc:

* Is rarely urgent bc playing only gets more fun the longer I go without it
* That said, if today is all I have then I'd want guitar to be part of it and it also can serve as a ""spiritual muscle-building ego machine""
* There actually is a deadline for it, though, as friends coming over this weekend to jam

Make rice. Good ""if idle"" candidate bc:

* Is no longer urgent bc I've identified a number of convenient meal alternatives not requiring rice
* Adds to meal nutritional variety/palatability/cleanliness

Get/cook chicken bc won't be able to tomorrow bc in the office:

* This breaks the ""next event"" principle, where I don't address issues unrelated to the next event, e.g. I won't need chicken until dinner tomorrow so I won't address it until after breakfast tomorrow
* Of course, I wrote this down *because* I won't be able to cook chicken tomorrow bc I'll be in the office but this is still a violation and causes me to get wrapped around the axle trying to fit something for tomorrow into today
* That said, if I was completely idle with no other ""if idle"" candidates, I would cook chicken but the very existence of / forethinking of this task should probably be discouraged bc it wires my brain to let in the future

Various financial/medical tasks:

* These fall into theoretical future and inexact science category

1qurii4,https://i.redd.it/2owdv8y34ahg1.jpeg,"Attended a Stable Money event in Pune - learned a lot about bonds, ETFs & investing","Last Sunday, I attended an investing-related event in Pune, and I wanted to share my experience here.

 The event was focused on the Stable Money app and was sponsored by them. A friend of mine, Unmesh, suggested the event but couldn’t attend, so he shared his ticket with me.

 One of the main reasons I decided to go was because Mandeep from the LLA team was leading the session. I’ve watched quite a few LLA videos, so I was curious to attend a live session. I also wanted to meet Saurabh Jain, the founder of Stable Money. The event was hosted at a hotel in Viman Nagar, Pune.

 The session started with a brief introduction, after which Mandeep began explaining topics like bonds, ETFs, taxation, and government policies. The session was genuinely insightful. He used charts and real numbers to explain investment concepts and also talked about common scams that investors should be careful about.

 After that, there was a Q&A session. Some of the questions were really interesting. One person sitting next to me asked, “What percentage of our investment should be in overseas stocks?” Mandeep answered very clearly. He said we should invest in businesses we truly believe in and understand. He also shared that personally, his investments are split 50–50 between India and the US. There were many other questions as well, though I don’t remember all of them now.

 Later, Saurabh Jain took the mic and shared his journey. This was one of the most interesting parts for me, especially because he’s also from Pune. He spoke about cracking IIT, starting his career, facing a layoff, and eventually building Stable Money after a few years. He also mentioned how LLA contributed to Stable Money’s growth.

 Towards the end, I stood up and thanked Mandeep and the LLA team for their insurance-related videos, which really helped me understand insurance plans better. I also told Saurabh that I first came across him on the PGX podcast, where I liked how clearly and structurally he explained his business.

 After the event, I clicked a few pictures with Mandeep, posted one on Instagram, grabbed some coffee and snacks, and then headed home. Overall, it was a great learning experience and definitely worth attending.",1,1770124219.0,fcroad,0,1.0,False

We talked for about a week and honestly he seemed normal. Funny, polite, consistent. Not overly flirty, not weird, not one of those guys who sends one-word replies and disappears for 2 days. So when he asked me out for dinner, I said yes.

We picked a casual restaurant. Not expensive, not too formal. Just something easy for a first date. I got there first, grabbed a table and waited.

About 10 minutes later, Mark walks in. But he is not alone. He comes in with another guy around the same age. His friend.

At first I thought maybe they ran into each other outside and the friend was just walking in with him, like they were about to split up.

Nope.

The friend sits down. Right across from me. Mark smiles like everything is normal and goes, Oh yeah, this is my friend Josh. He was bored so I brought him.

I just stared at him.

I genuinely thought he was joking. Like maybe Josh would leave after saying hi.

But then Josh starts talking. Asking me where I’m from. What I do for work. If I date a lot. Like he is interviewing me too. I was so uncomfortable. It felt like I was being watched. I tried to keep it polite, but my brain was screaming. This was supposed to be a date. Not a group hangout. Not a test. Not some weird two on one situation where I’m the entertainment.

So I asked Mark, quietly, why did you bring him?

Mark laughed and said he did not want it to be awkward. Which made no sense because now it was ten times more awkward. I told him I came here to meet him, not his friend, and I was not comfortable with this. Mark immediately got defensive and said Josh is basically like his brother and I should not be acting like it is a big deal. Then Josh jumps in and says, Yeah, chill. It’s just dinner.

That annoyed me even more, because now I’m being told to chill by the random guy I did not even agree to meet. So I stood up, put cash down for my drink, and said I’m leaving. Mark looked shocked and said I was being rude and dramatic. He said I embarrassed him and made it seem like he did something wrong.

I told him he did do something wrong. He changed the whole plan without telling me and put me in an uncomfortable situation. As I walked out, Josh literally laughed and said, Guess she can’t hang.

Now Mark has been texting me saying I overreacted, that his friend was only there because he gets nervous on first dates, and that I could have at least stayed and been nice. But I feel like I’m not crazy for thinking this is weird.

If he was nervous, he could have told me beforehand. Or chosen a less intense date or met in public for coffee or anything other than surprising me with an extra person.

The leadership angle in that recent writeup about a pivot and why India became central to the strategy is an interesting tell for RIME: it reads like a company trying to turn a narrative into execution.



Pre-market is basically flat with RІMЕ at $1.06, but Yesterday's move was remarkable, 20% gain at peak with +16% close. The LinkedIn note about SemiCab showing up at the Retail Supply Chain Conference also matters to me because it implies they are doing the unglamorous work: talking to carriers and LSPs about reducing empty miles and lowering transportation costs.



Now the hard stats: market cap is about $6.10M, revenue growth shows 1273.2%, and yesterday volume was 1.8M (about 1.9x the 10d average of 989K and 2.1x the 3mo average of 873K). Technically it is below the 50MA ($1.25) and 200MA ($2.10), with a 52-week range of $0.73 to $6.00. Risk seems defined, but what is your take here?

Getting around the city was a breeze. Trams and buses run frequently and take you just about anywhere, and the HSL app is a pleasure to use. We also loved how easy it was to get to and from the airport. Thrift shopping at UFF was another highlight, we found some amazing deals and only wish we’d had more room in our luggage. 

Also worthy of mention is the Oodi Library. What an amazing place! This should be the model for all libraries of this size, it's simply breathtaking seeing the place packed to the gills with people who were reading, having coffee and chatting or creating/producing music in one of the many recording rooms. 

Overall, we loved the city, the people, the public transport, and even the weather. Although it was colder than NYC, it felt surprisingly manageable thanks to the lack of wind. Hoping to come back in the summer. Kiitos!

How a $10 Investment Helped Me Turn My Business Around

Three months ago, I was on the verge of financial collapse.

I had pending rent, a looming bank loan, and my watch business wasn’t making any sales despite countless efforts. I was stressed, panicked, and didn’t know my next move.

One evening, still scrolling through my contacts in despair, I remembered someone who might help: Christian Michaelides, one of the best salesmen I know.

Even though it felt awkward, I called him. I explained my situation and asked for advice.

He shared a story from his own past struggles and gave me one simple but powerful tip: I wasn’t approaching sales with the right energy and focus.

Then he introduced me to Davidoff Coffee. According to him, just 1–2 cups a day helped him regain clarity, energy, and drive to push his business forward.

Honestly, I was skeptical. Coffee? Really? But at that point, I had nothing to lose.

The first sip changed everything. The aroma, the warmth, the energy—it was like a reset button for my mind. Suddenly, I could think clearly, plan effectively, and approach my work with renewed focus.

Three weeks later, my business was thriving again. Sales soared, and I finally felt in control.

When life feels overwhelming and your energy is low, a cup of Davidoff Coffee can give you the clarity and drive to get back on track.

# A childhood memory of winter day long ago

By NATALIE KENT

We rushed home from Sunday school early that day in February! In fact we almost ran all the way. Our cheeks were red and we were quite breathless as we sat down to dip the homemade bread in the homemade chicken soup which was our lunch that day. We were in a great hurry because we had made plans to go skiing and sliding with all our friends in the little country school.

We strapped on our skis and dragged our sleds along across the fields to the neighbor’s steep hill. We found nearly all the children in our one-room school gathered there.

It was a perfect winter day. The sun made the hard crusted snow glisten like silver and the bushes look as if they had been bedecked in Liz Taylor’s diamonds.

We didn’t bother to look at the thermometer, but I remember the crisp crunchy sound of our skis sliding over the snow drifts.

Our skis were rather cumbersome. Some of the children had them made out of barrel staves and there were about a dozen homemade toboggans.

We had a wonderful time! Then again and again we slid down the hill, climbing laboriously to the top and repeating the fun. Soon the sun began to spread its crimson and emerald rays behind the tall pine trees atop the hill. Those trees seemed to reach up to the colorful winter sky accentuating the winter landscape.

Soon a tangible sort of twilight fell over the fields and the colors seemed to change. The sky became more of a violet and peach color as I climbed the hill for one more dash to the bottom.

As I started downhill I heard the jingle of sleigh bells close to the fence on the road. I turned to look, and recognized the cutter, upholstered in red plush, the lively roan team, the fur cap, and the cigar. Yes, it was my sister’s beau driving out from Fish Creek and coming to our house!

I didn’t try to make another slide, but started for home in anticipation of the fine supper that no doubt was being prepared.

The sun was sinking rapidly behind the skeleton woods. The sky was a sort of all-over aquamarine color and the evening star shone down brightly.

A few children were still on the hill, but I hurried to get home. The world seemed very peaceful and beautiful. It seems that I can still hear the dog barking in the distance and see the lamplight shining across the snow from the windows in the old farm house.

Mother and sister had fixed a grand supper. We were all very hungry from the exercise in the cold air. The chicken and the fixings all topped off with the big layer cake floating in whipped cream and served with wild strawberries was too good to forget.

In the evening after the dishes were washed, I was allowed to play with my big doll with the brown curls. She sat in the cold parlor all week in front of the bric-a-brac stand, but on Sunday when a fire was built in the parlor stove I was allowed to hold her.

Sister was playing “By the Light of the Silvery Moon,” when we heard a commotion in our barnyard. We all ran to the windows as our dog barked very loudly. We could easily discern in the moonlight a team and a large sleigh driving into our yard. The sleigh bells jingled merrily as many voices rose crying out “surprise, surprise!”

Soon about 15 bundled-up young people came running into our kitchen carrying dishes of food of all sorts, all in high spirits and still crying, “surprise, surprise!”

Father put his big coat on and went out to put the team in the barn and feed them hay.

Mother rushed around to replenish all the fires and put the tea kettles on the range.

Sister ran to the bedroom to put more powder on her face and change her dress.

My sisters, little brother, and I attempted to stay quietly in the background and watch all the grownups.

More lamps were lit and wraps were piled high on the spare bed. There was a great deal of laughter and conversation and many happy faces.

Soon the big dining room had been cleared of rag rugs, chairs, and the sewing machine moved to the porch. Father played the accordion and our hired man played the harmonica. One of the boys had brought his violin and played beautiful waltzes.

Father was very proud of the narrow boards in the hardwood floor in the dining room. He had done the work himself and polished the floor well. It made a fine dance floor and the crowd made good use of it. They did the two-step, polka, and waltz.

About ten o’clock mother ordered us younger children upstairs to bed. Reluctantly I obeyed and very slowly undressed. I could hear the music and the merriment downstairs and was certainly in no mood for sleeping.

My sisters and little brother were soon sound asleep, but I wrapped a blanket about me (I didn’t have a bathrobe), and crept quietly down the stairs.

The hallway was dark. It also led to the cellar. There was a closet under the stairs and many shelves holding mysterious medicines, drugs, boxes, etc. I had always been rather afraid of that dark shadowy hallway, but that night I crept stealthily down, opened the dining room door so a crack of light would come through, and crouched there with my blanket wrapped around me watching the merriment in the other part of the old farm house.

Soon the dancing was over and I watched the big dining table being stretched out. Mother used the big granite coffee pot and all the girls seemed to be piling salads, beans, sandwiches, and gorgeous cakes on that long white tablecloth.

Once mother rushed into the hallway to get cream for the coffee from the shelf. She also went down the cellar steps and came up with crabapple pickles and also homemade dill pickles. I hid under the stairs in that cubbyhole full of old coats.

As I watched everyone seated around the table eating and drinking, I became very sleepy. I wished I could steal out and get some of that delicious looking food. But I would not go up to bed yet. I was afraid I might miss something.

Soon after the last cup of coffee had been served, the people put on their wraps again and waved good-bye. Father had helped get the team out of the barn and hitched to the sleigh. The fur robes were warmed and tucked about the knees, and soon the last of the sleigh bells could be heard jingling as the sleigh vanished around the corner of the schoolhouse.

After a while, mother and father went to bed in their room downstairs. The lamp was turned low. The house was very quiet in contrast to the noise of a short time before.

Sister and her beau were seated on the plush lounge near the door where I was crouching in my blankets. I strained my ears to the door and heard him propose marriage to her. I was wide awake! I had read about romance but didn’t expect to get that close to it at that tender age. I was thrilled when he kissed her good-night. I wanted to reach out and touch them because they were so close to me.

My sister found me when she came up the stairs carrying the lamp. She tucked me in and didn’t tell my mother how naughty I had been.

With all the skiing on the hill, the surprise party, and my big sister’s romance, no winder I can’t forget that Sunday! No wonder I fell asleep on my desk in school the next day!

Which do you prefer?,"https://preview.redd.it/atphl6il87hg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3345d014166a1e9e57970e7462e221e5bf26b435

Hi Extract Making Friends of Reddit,  
  
It's 2 Bean Tuesday when we talk about the differences between two different vanilla beans. This week's beans are both V.planifolia species but are grown in two different regions. One in Alor Island Indoensia and the other in Papua New Guinea. It's fun to see and learn how soil and climate have such a big impact on final taste.  
  
When it comes to vanilla beans, the species *Vanilla planifolia* is the most widely cultivated and beloved variety in the world. But here's something fascinating: not all *V. planifolia* beans taste the same. Two remarkable examples of this are vanilla beans from Papua New Guinea and Alor Island, Indonesia. Though they share the same botanical lineage, these beans offer distinctly different flavor experiences—and it all comes down to terroir.

# What is Terroir?

Terroir is a French term that refers to the unique combination of climate, soil, geography, and cultivation practices that influence the characteristics of agricultural products. Just as terroir affects wine, coffee, and chocolate, it also impacts vanilla beans. The same vanilla orchid species grown in different regions will produce beans with unique flavor profiles shaped by their environment.

# Papua New Guinea: Volcanic Richness Meets Tropical Intensity

# Climate

Papua New Guinea sits just south of the equator in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, experiencing a tropical climate with high humidity and consistent rainfall throughout the year. The country's mountainous terrain creates microclimates with varying temperatures and moisture levels, providing ideal conditions for vanilla cultivation in specific highland regions.

# Soil and Geography

Papua New Guinea's volcanic soil is incredibly rich in minerals and nutrients, thanks to the country's position along the Pacific Ring of Fire. This volcanic terroir contributes to the beans' robust character. The mountainous landscape, with elevations ranging from coastal lowlands to highland plateaus, creates diverse growing conditions that influence bean development.

# Flavor Profile

Papua New Guinea vanilla beans are known for their bold, earthy, and complex flavor profile. Expect deep, rich notes with hints of chocolate, smoke, and wood. These beans have a robust vanilla character with a slightly creamy undertone and a warm, lingering finish. The volcanic soil imparts a distinctive mineral quality that sets PNG beans apart from other origins.

# Alor Island, Indonesia: Island Terroir and Artisanal Tradition

# Climate

Alor Island is part of the East Nusa Tenggara province in Indonesia, located in the Lesser Sunda Islands. The island experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The maritime influence moderates temperatures, while seasonal monsoons bring concentrated periods of rainfall followed by drier months—a pattern that influences the curing and flavor development of the beans.

# Soil and Geography

Alor Island's soil composition differs from Papua New Guinea's volcanic richness. While still mineral-rich, the island's terroir includes a mix of limestone and clay soils with excellent drainage. The island's smaller size and coastal proximity mean that vanilla orchids benefit from sea breezes and maritime influences. The terrain is hilly but less dramatically mountainous than Papua New Guinea, creating a different microclimate for vanilla cultivation.

# Flavor Profile

Alor Island Indonesian vanilla beans offer a distinctly different experience. These beans are characterized by their smooth, creamy vanilla flavor with pronounced chocolate and caramel notes. They tend to be sweeter and more mellow than their Papua New Guinea counterparts, with a velvety texture and a rich, buttery finish. The maritime influence and unique soil composition contribute to a more refined, less earthy character.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1qur8hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoahKahan/comments/1qur8hx/fenway_shows/,Fenway Shows,"With the tour fully announced now my wife and I are planning which show(s) to go to. We’ve never seen Noah live, but he’s been at the top of our radar for years. We did get to see Gigi live last year and look forward to seeing her open. 

Of course, Fenway is at the top of the bucket list, especially after the iconic 2024 shows and all the live media that came after them to highlight those nights. We would have to travel, so I’ve got a few questions regarding them. 

1. Is traveling to the Fenway shows frowned upon? I know many were hoping he’d do Gillette due to the New England fanbase being so massive, so I don’t want to feel like I’m taking seats from those in the area already. 

2. Which show (Friday or Saturday) do you think will be better to go to? I looked back at the setlists from 2024 and N1 he played 23 songs including the appearances from The Lumineers and Gracie Abrams, while N2 he played 22 songs with an appearance from Mt. Joy.

3. Where do you think the best seats are? I’ve seen that the netting can get in the way and want to avoid that, but wasn’t sure if we should go further down the baseline or to the higher level. 

4. What are your best Boston recommendations? We’re hoping to stay somewhere near Fenway, but don’t want to break the bank. Also want to know the best places for food, coffee, and drinks along with best local stores (records, books, and all other cool stuff).

Thanks to anyone who is able to help with these questions! I greatly appreciate any feedback!",1,1770123483.0,NoahKahan,26,0.6,False

I’ve noticed that large platforms in the food space use internal directories where listed businesses often gain visibility, traffic, and authority — even outside the platform itself.

My questions are more structural than tactical:

– What factors truly make a directory authoritative today?  
– Is it mainly architecture, internal linking, UGC, structured data, editorial backlinks, or something else?  
– At what point does a directory stop being “just a list of sites” and start behaving like a trusted entity in Google’s eyes?

After some digging (and a gentle nudge from my doctor), I realized I probably wasn’t getting enough iron from my day-to-day meals. That’s what led me down the rabbit hole of **Iron-Rich Green Smoothie Recipes for Tired Days**, and honestly, I wish I’d tried this sooner.

I used to think green smoothies were all about detox vibes and leafy bitterness. Turns out, when you build them right, they can be both energizing *and* genuinely tasty. The key with **Iron-Rich Green Smoothie Recipes for Tired Days** is pairing iron-rich greens (like spinach, kale, parsley) with vitamin C sources so your body actually absorbs the iron. Once I started adding things like berries, citrus, or kiwi, it made a noticeable difference.

What I like about these **Iron-Rich Green Smoothie Recipes for Tired Days** is how practical they are. You don’t need powders or supplements if you don’t want them—just whole ingredients you can grab at the grocery store. Seeds, greens, a bit of fruit, maybe some plant-based protein, and you’re set. I usually have one mid-morning or early afternoon when my energy starts dipping.

The energy boost isn’t instant like caffeine, but it feels more… stable. After a couple of weeks of sticking with **Iron-Rich Green Smoothie Recipes for Tired Days**, I noticed fewer afternoon crashes and less brain fog. It’s subtle, but consistent—and that’s what makes it sustainable.

I found this guide on [**Iron-Rich Green Smoothie Recipes for Tired Days**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/iron-rich-green-smoothie-recipes-for-tired-days//) really helpful because it explains *why* certain ingredient combos work, not just what to throw in a blender. It also avoids the “superfood overload” trap and keeps things realistic for everyday life.

I’m not saying smoothies are a cure-all, but adding **Iron-Rich Green Smoothie Recipes for Tired Days** to my routine has been a low-effort way to support my energy without relying on endless coffee refills.

Has anyone else here tried focusing on iron through smoothies or food instead of supplements? What ingredients helped you feel a real difference?

We were sitting on his porch on a Sunday afternoon, me mindlessly scrolling through social apps while supposedly ""visiting"" him.

His words hit me like a truck. I'd been feeling this gnawing emptiness for months but couldn't name it. I had constant digital connection but zero meaningful human contact. I'd text people all day but couldn't remember the last time I'd looked someone in the eyes while having a real conversation.

""In my day,"" he continued, setting down his coffee, ""we had fewer people in our lives, but we actually knew them. Really knew them. Their struggles, their joys, their stories. Now you kids know everything about everyone and nothing that matters about anybody.""

That conversation changed everything. I realized I was part of an epidemic no one was discussing functional loneliness. We're surrounded by shallow connections but starving for depth. We're afraid to be vulnerable, so we hide behind carefully curated posts and filtered photos. We've replaced community with followers and conversations with comments.

The week after talking with my grandfather, I deleted social media from my phone and started inviting people for coffee instead of just liking their photos. I joined a local book club that meets in person. I started volunteering at an animal shelter where phones aren't practical while handling dogs.

The withdrawal was real. I felt anxious, like I was missing something important. But after two weeks, something shifted. I stopped reaching for my phone first thing in the morning. I started noticing the people around me. Real conversations became easier. The emptiness began to recede.

Are you feeling it too? That disconnect between your digital social life and the hollow feeling in your chest? Maybe it's time we all acknowledged the loneliness epidemic we're living through and started rebuilding what we've lost. Real connection. Real community. Real presence.

The leadership angle in that recent writeup about a pivot and why India became central to the strategy is an interesting tell for RIME: it reads like a company trying to turn a narrative into execution.



Pre-market is basically flat with RIME at $1.06, but Yesterday's move was remarkable, 20% gain at peak with +16% close. The LinkedIn note about SemiCab showing up at the Retail Supply Chain Conference also matters to me because it implies they are doing the unglamorous work: talking to carriers and LSPs about reducing empty miles and lowering transportation costs.



Now the hard stats: market cap is about $6.10M, revenue growth shows 1273.2%, and yesterday volume was 1.8M (about 1.9x the 10d average of 989K and 2.1x the 3mo average of 873K). Technically it is below the 50MA ($1.25) and 200MA ($2.10), with a 52-week range of $0.73 to $6.00. Risk seems defined, but what is your take here?

I’m looking for advice on the best way to get into coffee roasting with a very specific goal: I want to run controlled experiments with co-fermented coffees and if I end up learning roasting well enough, I might turn it into a small side business in the future.


My priorities:

- Consistency & repeatability (so I can actually compare fermentation outcomes without roasting being the main variable).

- Ability to do small R&D batches, but ideally not be stuck forever at tiny capacities.

- A setup that can scale somewhat if I move from testing to selling.

- Practicality around smoke/ventilation (home environment; I can roast outside if needed).


Questions:

- If your main goal was experimental R&D (consistent cupping comparisons), would you prioritize a sample roaster (like IKAWA-style) first, or go straight to a 1kg-class roaster?

- For a one-roaster setup that can do both R&D and small production, what would you choose and why? 

- What capacity range do you consider the minimum to realistically sell small amounts without the workflow becoming painful?

- Any common mistakes when roasting co-fermented coffees specifically? 

- What extra tools matter most for this kind of work? (data logging, trier/bean temp probes, external cooling, smoke mitigation, color meter, moisture/aw meter, etc.)

My mum rang me Sunday night to say my grandad’s health had taken a turn and the family were trying to get out to see him ASAP. Only issue: my passport had expired and I’d been putting it off like a proper idiot because “I’ll do it next month” for about a year. Cue me on Monday morning, in my dressing gown, staring at the gov website with a coffee going cold, half convinced I’d missed my chance. I filled in the online renewal, paid the fee, did the photo thing (which rejected my first two attempts because my fringe apparently counts as a national security threat), and then it hit me: even the “fast” option still looked like it might be too slow. I started spiralling, googling forums, reading horror stories about lost documents, the whole lot. I rang the advice line and got the classic hold music for ages, but when someone finally picked up she was calm, blunt, and actually helpful. She explained what I could and couldn’t do, told me to book an urgent appointment and bring specific bits of ID, and said “don’t overcomplicate it, just bring exactly what you have.” I booked the first slot I could get, which meant getting a train to another city at stupid o’clock, but honestly I would’ve crawled there at that point.



The appointment itself was in this bland office building that smells faintly of hand sanitiser and stress. Everyone in the waiting area looked like they’d either cried already or were about to. I get called up, and the staff member at the desk takes one look at my paperwork and goes “Right, let’s sort you out.” No sighing, no power trip, just straight into problem solving. One of my documents wasn’t the exact version they prefer, and my heart actually dropped, but she didn’t do the whole “computer says no” thing. She asked a couple questions, checked something on her screen, then said “Okay, we can work with that, but I need you to sign this and I’m going to add a note so it doesn’t bounce later.” She also noticed my photo had a tiny shadow and instead of rejecting it she said, “It’s fine, but if you want to redo it now I’ll tell you the exact lighting that passes.” She basically coached me like a stressed GCSE student. Ten minutes later I had a receipt, a clear timeline, and for the first time all week I felt my shoulders drop. The wild part: they actually stuck to the timeline. I got a text update the next day, then another, and by Thursday morning my new passport was in my hand. Thursday. I genuinely stood in my hallway holding it like it was the Holy Grail. I know it’s their job, but the difference between someone who treats you like an inconvenience and someone who treats you like a human is massive.

I’ve pushed a new update to my personal portfolio and would like some design-focused feedback.

Recent changes:

* Tighter overall layout with reduced visual noise
* Added a GitHub contribution heatmap for quick activity context
* Added a testimonials section
* Cleaned up spacing and hierarchy across sections

The goal was clarity and signal over decoration. Less scrolling, fewer distractions, faster scanning.

Portfolio link: [**https://akoder.xyz/**](https://akoder.xyz/)

I’m mainly looking for feedback on:

* Layout density and spacing
* Whether the heatmap/testimonials add value or feel forced
* First-impression clarity for other devs or recruiters

Appreciate any critique, especially if something feels unnecessary or distracting.",2,1770122955.0,webdesign,5,1.0,False

Should I be adjusting my caffeine consumption on this med? I don’t think I drink too much caffeine, just my usual double espresso in the morning and maybe a second cup of either filtered coffee or protein coffee before noon. I’m going to try to eliminate that second coffee I guess..

The ICE agents in these situations didn't even react negatively,  they showed a lot of restraint as they were being assaulted. 

While I understand the anger the general public feels towards them, I can't accept this type of physical harassment.

1quqvp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/1quqvp1/words_of_advice_for_expats_coming_to_saudi_esp/,"Words of advice for expats coming to Saudi, esp from the West","I often hear the same complaints from my expat friends and colleagues who’ve moved to Riyadh, so I thought to post here for who ever cares to read. FYI I moved to riyadh \~2 years ago, my colleagues at work are 98% Saudi. However, I don’t know every Saudi in the Kingdom, or even in riyadh, so I can’t speak for their nation. This advice is based on my interactions only.

1. More than anything else, spend time getting to know Saudis. Don’t limit yourself to expat crowds (I can’t stress this enough). The latter is all too common, comfortable, and often encouraged. But you’re missing out on a lot. Navigating life in Saudi and making sense of the culture became much easier once I had a few Saudi friends. And they are now my dearest. FYI I don’t speak any Arabic, never visited Saudi or met a Saudi before I moved here. 

2. Learn about the culture. It’s not Khabsa on HungerStation or having some saudi coffee and dates. It’s not boulevard world. Go to the local hangouts in the evenings (cafes and restaurants), picnic at Wadi Hanifa, visit a saudi friend’s Istraha, join a saudi camping trip, try fasting and breaking fast with them, accept invitations to their celebrations (I’ve been lucky to attend some weddings etc). I learned a ton about Saudi culture, values, and bonds and there’s lots to admire. This isn’t an exhaustive list of course, point being you should immerse yourself.

3. Yes, traffic is a nightmare in Riyadh. Long journeys and dangerous driving (TikTok at the steering) is something you’re likely to experience. But it affects everyone, including the Saudis. No one wants it and we hope it’ll improve. Complaining doesn’t help, just be very patient and careful on the roads. You’ll live.

4. Customer service can be lacking (significantly, across sectors). Maybe they just don’t care if you buy tbh, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get what you need. Don’t expect super supportive and special treatment as a customer, just take what you need. Bad customer service is perhaps an inconvenience, but it doesn’t change your life. 

5. Work culture etc takes some getting used to, but ‘when in Rome’. There’s a ton of positives abt the work environment here - find and focus on those. 

6. It is all too easy to criticise the actions of the country, investments and projects, etc. Don’t indulge this for too long. Challenge yourself to understand the purpose, rationale, and outcomes they’re focused on. As an expat, you’ve most probably been invited here to support one of these goals - figure out how you can help steer towards better outcomes if you really care. 

7. Saudi is a young nation, both in terms of its state being more proactive on the global stage (post Vision 2030) and in terms of demographics. Bear both in mind. 

8. Yes, it’s effing hot in the summer. You knew it would be. 

9. I’ve found Saudis (those I’ve met, so this is not a generalisation) are a proud people and supportive of their leadership. And with the Trumps, Starmers, etc. leading the ‘free’ world, why shouldn’t they be? 

So much more to say. ",4,1770122438.0,saudiarabia,3,1.0,False
