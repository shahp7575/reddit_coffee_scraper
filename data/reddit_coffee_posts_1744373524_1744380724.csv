 The coffee Obsession is getting worse I am looking to take the plunge into roasting. Playing with different blends.. Learn the craft. 

  
What is the best small batch roaster? 

  
Like I said.. I am looking to explore blends and different roast levels. I am looking for the best. A machine that will have high quality output.. Superb roastability. This is merely a hobby at the moment but I take my hobby's serious. I will be doing small batches until I figure out good blends. Then I will explore scaling.

**Arriving - Saturday, April 12th 2:00PM , Hotel near Republique** 

Coffee / wine at Causeries, Caf√© 

Late lunch at Les Petit Bouch√©es (?) just for snacks and small plates before dinner dinner

Stroll the Seine + BHV shopping mall 

Dinner (hesitating between Sugaar and Brutos (both found on Tiktok)

**Sunday** 

I found a private skincare shopping tour at Galeries Lafyatte Champs-√âlys√©es early in the am, seems fun like a walk along the Seine then trying skincare products in a private area of the store. It's early though, 9:30am (**thoughts?**) A friend of a friend shared it with me on Trip Advisor but it's new and doesn't have any reviews yet.

Lunch - **looking for recs near Champs-√âlys√©es** not too touristy though!

Snack - Collagen Caf√© in the 9th, for the collagen treats

Hit up Galleries Lafayette in the 9th arrondissement too, they send me notifications about their **Innerskin Center**, I may test it out (is it worth it)? 

**Monday - Wednesday**

Was told to avoid City Pharma during the weekend so I'll go during the day Monday - **what are some must buys in French skincare??**

**Is the Biologique Recherche institute worth it? I'll try to get a facial while I'm there.** 

Possibly will try Oh My Cream to see the Goop products now in France.

Loved it. Absolutely loved it. And I've brought it up to him a few times since then as one of the best, most loving things he's ever done for me.

Well -- our wedding is in two months. Shit's getting real. Stress is happening. So my man, my sweet wonderful man, decided last night to give me another one. Where I feel so seen, not just in my big-girl career, but in who I am as a human being.

Sharing it with all of you. This is what life is like for me outside of the church. I'm ecstatic to be marrying such a wonderful, loving partner!

**Patriarchal UnBlessing for an ExMormon Graphic Designer Bride-to-Be**  
*Given by your future husband, lover, snack-bringer, and eternal partner in vibes.*

Dearly beloved,  
In the name of love, lust, late-night giggles, and shared Amazon Prime accounts, I lay my unworthy hands upon your head‚Äînot in priesthood power, but in awe of the divine artwork that is you.

Sister, formerly of Zion, always of Adobe Creative Suite, thou art chosen. Chosen to wield the sacred stylus and lay waste to ugly fonts and off-brand color palettes. Your gift for design shall be a light upon the Pinterest board, a beacon in the wilderness of bad UX.

Yea, though you walk through the valley of ward brunches, thou fearst no Relief Society president, for you have seen the truth‚Äîand it is not a casserole.

I bless you with a future rich in warm mornings, slow coffee, and clients who actually pay on time. Your portfolio shall shine, and your inbox shall be cleansed of all unpaid ""exposure opportunities."" Your hands shall never cramp from over-revising logos for chiropractors.

I bless your body‚Äîthat magnificent, earthly temple with curves like Mission Peak, resilient as denim, holy as Sunday naps. May your libido be mighty and your skincare routine uninterrupted. Yea, I say unto thee, your garments shall henceforth be lacy, optional, and occasionally left on the floor.

Your womb, though no longer under the jurisdiction of Deseret Book, is yours to do with as thou wilt. Whether you fill the earth with children, plants, or golden retrievers, your nurturing spirit shall not be questioned. Neither shall your decision to order sushi during fast Sunday.

I bless your union with me, the man who once thought CTR stood for *Choose The Ribeye*. Our love shall endure like a pioneer handcart, but with better suspension and Spotify Premium. We shall argue only about whether to keep or toss the Amazon boxes, and make up with forehead kisses and door-dash.

Thou shalt not bake funeral potatoes, unless thou *really* wanteth to, in which case I shall partake with gladness and lactose pills.

I say unto you, dear and brilliant apostate, you are worthy. Not of callings or eternal judgment, but of joy, of being seen, of being chosen‚Äînot by heaven, but by me. And lo, I choose you now and forever, through messy kitchens and gorgeous mood boards, through deadlines and date nights, through the inevitable trial of assembling IKEA furniture.

In the sacred and spicy name of mutual respect, slow dancing in the kitchen, and extremely consensual intimacy, I give this blessing.  
Amen.

Hi friends! 26F currently travelling through central europe with my husband - we just finished Prague, and now we're in Budapest having a blast. We're going to leave in a few days to Vienna so I wanted everyone's thoughts on this itinerary. We love history, experiences (we've done things like skydiving in Dubai, making pasta in Florence, or even just doing a tour with an art historian about Gaudi in Barcelona) and we really enjoy meeting new people.

Here's my rough itinerary for Vienna - honestly please let me know your thoughts because I could be super off here LOL:

Day 1

- get to hotel, check in and chill by 1 PM; after that we're going to do a walking tour of old town (this will take us through ideally st stephen's cathedral, the graben, kartner strass, hofburg palace exterior, etc)

- if we get lucky, standing room tickets at the opera

Day 2

- bright and early Sch√∂nbrunn Palace ‚Äî maybe strudel show + zoo

- we'll take a break and then do the hofburg palace complex + maybe the spanish riding school

Day 3

‚Äì Visit Belvedere Palace to see Klimt‚Äôs *The Kiss* and wander the gardens

- afternoon we're going to do MuseumsQuartier -  go into the Leopold Museum or just lounge around the MQ courtyard with a coffee.

- Go for an evening concert : a Mozart/Strauss concert in a palace or at the Musikverein.

Day 4
- honestly so far I'm keeping this day empty - we don't have anything planned so let me know if I should do anything else!",3,1744379745.0,Europetravel,0,1.0,False

Is it just yellow taxis and drinking tea next to a river? No, a place is it's people. When the people suffer, consciously or unconsciously, the place starts to die.
 
Kolkata is dying because there isn't any environment for learning, be it science, cinema or arts. Kolkata is dying because there are no jobs, there is no respect for the people who do good jobs.  The receding health of our education system didn't happen in one day or one year. It happened slowly. Slowly, govt grew greedy, recruitments stopped. Last year they came for doctors, now they came for the teachers, who's next? Govt schools aren't any better either. Colleges under CU are nothing but places of unions and politics and nobody wants a plain bachelor's degree because they know they won't get a job in this state. Before you blame brain drain, ask why it happens. 

I will counter the claim that the youth is useless because we have seen more voice against the evil by the youth in the last few years than by the old in the last decade. 

It might sound narrow and political but Kolkata is dying because it is in the hands of an illiterate govt that fosters only the lowly qualities of the people.

Kolkata is a place, not just an emotion. When you succumb an entire place into one word ""emotion"", you are not really helping what's at stake. Every place has it's own essence just like Kolkata and it's not a special city just because you live in it. If you truly love your city, save it by saving the most important things‚Äî education and morals. Coffee house and nostalgia can wait.",5,1744379587.0,kolkata,2,0.86,False
1jwqcuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_businessolution235/comments/1jwqcuz/airpods_pro_2nd_generation_review_why_didnt_i_buy/,AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Review ‚Äì Why Didn‚Äôt I Buy Them Sooner?,"After using the Google Pixel Buds Pro as my main daily earbuds for a year, I decided it was time to switch.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm a massive fan of the¬†[Pixel Buds Pro](https://amzn.to/3RfGP5w)¬†as well as some of the smart features they offer. But with me moving back to the¬†Apple ecosystem, I decided that it was time to upgrade.

I wasn‚Äôt actually planning to buy the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). I was actually looking at the Beats Studio Buds Plus, mainly because I like the look of the transparent version, but also because I‚Äôm not really a fan of the stem design.

Not only that, but I feel that earbuds without the stems just look better and slightly more modern, even though it‚Äôs not always the case as proved with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) which were released in September 2023.

Moreover, having owned the 1st generation AirPods Pro a few years ago, I wanted to buy something more exciting, and looking back at my thought process behind that, I think I was wrong. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

# Powerful Active Noise Cancellation

We all know how horrible commuting via public transport can be. As someone who commutes via public transport on a weekly, sometimes daily basis, having earbuds with a decent level of active noise cancellation (ANC) is essential.

I know that to many people this seems to be only a gimmick, but trust me when I tell you, that once you‚Äôve tried decent ANC, you won‚Äôt want to go back to normal earbuds or headphones!

The Google Pixel Buds Pro have a reasonable amount of active noise cancellation, but when I went on longer trips, I would usually take the¬†Soundcore Liberty 4 NC. In fact, there was a brief period of time when I used the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC as my daily drivers!

I guess the main reason I went back to the Pixel Buds Pro was the smart features.

Going back to the AirPods Pro (2nd generation), I think that they offer a phenomenal level of active noise cancellation. I can comfortably sit on a train and relax or do some work without being interrupted by screaming kids or generally loud carriages.

They work great in caf√©s and open areas too! I tend to use them a lot at my day job, where I sit in an open-plan office. I mean, when everybody is on a call or talking, these types of offices can get pretty loud.

Furthermore, I also like the fact that these offer Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency mode and adjusts the level based on the noise conditions around you.

# Transparency Mode works really well!

If your headphones or earbuds have ANC, it is essential for them to have a decent amount of ambient pass-through or, in this case, a decent transparency mode.

It helps with important daily tasks such as ordering a coffee or showing your ticket to the ticket inspector when on the train.

The 2nd generation AirPods Pro doesn‚Äôt disappoint in this department!

I am comfortably able to have conversations with people, even if they speak quietly.

As we all know, sometimes technology tends to fail, and in this case, I am referring to the speaker system on trains as well as train stations.

The other day, this exact failure happened when I was waiting for the train, the announcements were incredibly quiet on my platform, and they didn‚Äôt sound very clear. I used the AirPods Pro in transparency mode, and it allowed me to clearly hear the announcements.

I don‚Äôt know what I would have done if I hadn‚Äôt heard the platform change announcement!

I also like the fact that, like on the Pixel Buds Pro, the AirPods Pro have a mode which Apple calls Conversation Awareness which lowers the volume and enhances voices around you.

I find this mode great for working in an office, especially when you have your AirPods in and someone pops up to you to start a conversation.

# They have outstanding sound quality!

When it comes to sound quality, we all have different tastes in sound, some people prefer the sound to be flat, some prefer strong bass and some want it to be in the middle.

But the truth of the matter is that ‚Äúgood sound quality‚Äù can be defined in many ways, and it is dependent on the person. That is why when I review audio products, I try to talk about how the sound sounds, how I like my sound.

I like the sound to be clear so that I can clearly hear all the instruments, but at the same time, I like to be able to feel that bass. I think that the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) deliver on that incredibly well. I have yet to find a song that sounds tinny!

In terms of vocals, they sound incredibly clear, especially when on calls or when listening to podcasts or audiobooks, something I tend to do a lot when travelling. I would even go as far as saying that listening to audiobooks has practically¬†changed my life!

Overall, I think that for my taste in sound, these sound fantastic!

# They are packed with some incredibly useful features

The 2nd generation AirPods Pro come with some incredibly useful features, features that I think all premium earbuds should have, and I‚Äôm not talking about the ANC or premium sound quality.

I‚Äôm talking about the practical features such as the built-in speaker that allows you to easily find your case if you‚Äôve misplaced it, as well as compatibility with the Find My app.

You can even use this feature to help you find a single earbud, but the alarm is considerably quieter.

However, I think it‚Äôs worth me mentioning that I haven‚Äôt yet had a chance to use the Find My feature in a real-world scenario. I only tried it in my office, and it worked incredibly well. So I suppose this feature is great for when you misplace an earbud on your desk.

Hopefully, I will never have to try it in a real-life scenario where I lose my earbuds or they get stolen.

I also like the Spatial Audio with face tracking. I know that to many this is just a gimmick, but I actually really like it, especially when watching movies.

# Conclusion

To summarise my review of the AirPods Pro (2nd generation), I think that they are brilliant, and although I‚Äôve only been daily driving them for a month, they will definitely remain my daily drivers for the foreseeable future.

I honestly don‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt even consider getting these earlier, as they are incredibly good and fit my lifestyle perfectly!

And, that‚Äôs¬†the thing with technology. I know that there will be people out there who will disagree with me on this and that is perfectly fine, after all, we all have our preferences and there are many other great sets of wireless earbuds out there!",1,1744379410.0,u_businessolution235,0,1.0,False

I unfortunately am not up to date on my SCP roster/encyclopedia. Especially given my remote task of A. Consume Senior staff approved substances. B. Return any and all data regarding my dreams that may or may not be related to an ongoing case. 

Now as for the dream in question, I recently dreamed of being in a world of strange people who wore bird masks that stretched over their faces like skin with two big black holes for the eyes. These people were hooded and small, and what I could gather did not take kindly to strangers and would simply stare as I passed by. I was in a city, very white, smooth and textureless was the surface of their buildings. 

The bird people, lets call them the strangers, because after some time had passed in the city a voice in my head told me thats what they called themselves. ""The strangers dont take kindly to outsiders"" it said. ""The strangers dont like shoes"" they said. ""The strangers don't like me to walk out of norm"". I studied them, they were very animalistic, their bird masks serving a more practical function of being a part of them, as well as their cloaks. The strangers only stayed outside, the buildings had doors and windows but the strangers would never go in them. I never went in them.

Then one day, something made them aggressive. I thought maybe I stepped a toe out of line, or id done something rude. But they simply said ""Strangers don't like strangers"" and they chased me, chased me into one of the buildings they refused to go into.

And it worked! I got into a building that looked like they used it for research, computers, books. All covered in a thick white substance, the floors, the walls, everything that only me and their lab have determined to be biological in origin.

In this research lab there was an enclosed observation tower with a window , I climbed up to see what was happening and it turns out there were a lot more of them than I thought, I saw them rushing across fields to try and get into the building.

They chanted, ""strangers are food""
""Strangers become nothing""
""Strangers eat you""

As I saw them bend their bodies to form terrifying skeletal monsters, hearing bones snapping, I huddled in the observatory awaiting my end but then

I woke up. 

Anyway whomever reads this thank you, and perhaps if you could help a coffee addicted researcher on their latest report Id greatly appreciate it. And as always lets Secure. Contain. And Protect. Everyone.

my goal is to power a few things off the battery for 1-3 day periods of off grid living. (Laptop, wife wants a coffee maker) etc.  
From what i can tell my system can handle this but I've never paid close attention to how many amps the system actually outputs when the batteries drain low.  
The batteries usually display 14.4 volt, will a 12 volt unit work or will that cause issues?

## Understanding the Allure of Light Roast Coffee

Before we delve into Veranda Blend specifically, let's appreciate what makes light roast coffee unique. As the name suggests, light roasts undergo a shorter roasting process than medium or dark roasts. This preserves more of the coffee bean's original characteristics, resulting in a lighter body, higher acidity, and frequently enough, more complex and delicate flavors. Many find that light roast coffee offers a brighter, more nuanced drinking experience.

## Veranda Blend: Whole Bean, ground Coffee, or K-Cups?

One of the appealing aspects of Veranda Blend is its availability in multiple formats, catering to various brewing preferences.

*   **Veranda Blend Ground Coffee:** For convenience, Veranda Blend ground coffee is a solid option. Starbucks offers pre-ground bags that are ready to brew, saving you time and effort. Keep in mind that pre-ground coffee tends to lose its freshness quicker than whole beans, so it is recommended you either use it up quickly or store correctly.
*   **Veranda Blend K Cups:** For single-cup brewing systems like Keurig, Veranda Blend K Cups provide the ultimate convenience. These pods offer a rapid and easy way to enjoy Veranda Blend, perfect for busy mornings or single servings. However, some believe that K-Cups sacrifice some flavor compared to freshly brewed coffee from whole beans or ground coffee.

When I lay down at night, I feel an urge to urinate even if I JUST did before getting into bed. I sometimes have to get up immediately and go let the drop out because it drives me insane. Once I fall asleep, I don't wet myself or anything, but I do get up throughout the night. For years, I never had to get up in the night to go to the bathroom. Now, even if I haven't had anything to drink up to two hours before lying down, I'm up at least three times, not at consistent times.

I now suddenly have an awareness about my bladder that I have never had before. When my body begins to relax, I ALMOST feel like I will lose control and end up peeing the bed. This feeling is worse if I'm lying on either side and subsides if I lie on my back, but it is still there. The moments leading up to sleep, I think about my bladder because I can FEEL it. I'm more aware of it throughout the day now, but this incontinent feeling usually doesn't happen throughout the day, only at night

I had a urine test done thinking I had an asymptomatic UTI, which I just learned is possible, but everything came back perfectly normal. Because of the symptoms I described, they did put me on a 7-day antibiotic anyway just in case I have an annual coming up with a primary care doctor where I will have a blood test, and I will probably ask for another urine test as well. I'm getting pretty freaked out and very frustrated with this new way my body is carrying out. I'm usually the person that never has to stop on road trips, never has to use an airplane bathroom, etc.¬†

For those who want to try and diagnose me or want more information - I don't drink the oz of water I probably should every day, I am sober and have been for 7 months, usually don't drink soda, I have coffee every morning, I am 30 years old, I'm not on any medication (aside from the antibiotic currently), no birth control. It's usually between a 1 and a 5 on the pee color chart. I have no other illnesses.¬†

I have been wondering if I have Enodmetriosis due to my period symptoms changing and intensifying since last year. However, my OBGYN said that Endo cannot be diagnosed without surgery, but I have had several friends diagnosed by doctors without the surgery. One of them has level 4 Endo and saw a specialist in Denver, CO, and we shared our experiences and have similar symptoms, but she tends to have much, much more pain. I JUST read another thread asking if this can cause bladder issues. Has anyone else experienced this? ",3,1744378464.0,endometriosis,0,1.0,False

I add creamer, forget to empty it that night, can't reach in there with a brush, etc.  So if it's got crud in there, how best should I get it up and out?

My usual approach is a little dish soap, some hot water, shake it, ended with plenty of rinsing.  Fine enough for me, but its made me wonder about that sloshing water.

Would you all have some insight on optimizing the amount of water being sloshed to increase the scouring effect inside the thermos?

Filled to the top doesn't seem right since there's virtually no movement at that point, and I probably have slightly slower shaking.  Very little water makes for faster shaking but I don't get that feeling of impact as the water hits the side so my brain tells me there's no work being done.

Here's some constraints and variables I think I could reasonably establish with a little experimenting: frequency of shaking (across a range of weights), water temp (but with zero soak time), dish soap (present or not: I'd imagine this changes the surface tension).  Anything else that should be considered as being relevant to optimizing the force/velocity of the water as it collides with the walls of the thermos and impacts ""crud"" also stuck to those walls?

Not really looking for cleaning tips btw, though feel free to teach me about food safety if you must.

Personally, mindfulness is a little easier when I try and act interested, and if you start to really think about the things around you, both man-made and natural, you can start to consider how incredible they are.

Think of a coffee cup you often use. The amount of work that went into it may seem small in a sense, but if you were to keep breaking it down there‚Äôs a mind blowing amount of effort into something even that simple. 

There are the people who find the natural materials for the cup, then there are the people who ship those materials to warehouses. Those materials then get handed to workers who do one part of making the cup. The cup is finished by someone else, packed by another person, shipped by another, and stocked by someone entirely different. The people who made the website that sell the cup are apart of it too. 

Now think about the fact that every single one of the hundreds and maybe thousands of people involved in the process of making everything around you, have their own full lives with their own struggles and loves and emotions and faith and opinions.

I've been working on a project to make 100+ EA objects compatible with the Sales Display system from Businesses and Hobbies. This includes kitchen counters, accent tables, coffee tables, dining tables, desks, racks, shelves, collectors displays, bookshelves, dressers and more! I started working on this for myself but I thought others might want access to it too? It'd be free of course.



Let me know your thoughts, I have no idea how much interest there might be for something like this :)



**New things you'd be able to sell:**

* Kitchen appliances that go on counters like coffee machines and dishwashers, also sinks!
* TVs
* Clothes from the buy catalogue that hang from clothing racks
* TBC on Computers but I'm trying my best to make it work



**Highlights:**



These are CC 'clones' of EA objects with their normal EA swatches, meaning they won't override/replace the original versions in your game.



You'll have all the usual options from B&H when you click on them, like stock/clear surface and enable/disable sales. You'll be able to sell anything that can be normally placed on these objects, including items from the Buy catalogue and craftables.



They are visually identical to their EA version but they only function as Sales Displays! This means that Sims won't try to cook on display counters, change their clothes with display dressers, or get books from display bookshelves. This lets you have the aesthetic/look of an object without it messing up your business activities and overall autonomy.



Sims won't try to use items that are set for sale! For example, if you have a coffee machine listed for sale on top of a sales counter Sims won't try to make coffee with it. That's even if the business has make/drink coffee as an activity.



The Sales Display 'clones' are carefully tagged so they won't clutter or confuse your Buy catalogue. They'll only show up in the Small Business and Miscellaneous Surface categories. At the same time they'll be easily searchable by looking up 'MSD' (More Sales Displays).



Sims won't leave empty plates/cups on Sales Displays, even if they're display counters or tables. It's taken A LOT of work to ensure this doesn't happen but I figured it out!



Sales Display wall shelves will remain visible even if you have the walls fully down or in cutaway mode.



I'd release it in a way that makes it as easy as possible to decide which Sales Displays you want to add to your game. It'll likely be a visual catalogue that'll include the EA thumbnails of each object with their pack, object name, and their Sales Display CC file name.



These are EA clones/reworks so they won't use up much storage, they average 1-2MB per object.



**Caveats:**



This doesn't apply to Sales Displays for paintings, wall art, and so on. That'd be a completely different kind of project.



The Sales Display clones only work if you own the pack they originally came with.



I can only do this with packs I personally own! So far I've included selected objects from: Base Game, Businesses and Hobbies, Cats and Dogs, Cottage Living, Discover University, Eco-Lifestyle, For Rent, Get Together, Get to Work, Growing Together, High School Years, Horse Ranch, Life and Death, Seasons, Snowy Escape, Dine Out, Dream Home Decorator, Jungle Adventure, My Wedding Stories, Spa Day, Bowling Night, Fitness Stuff, Home Chef Hustle, Nifty Knitting, Paranormal, Blooming Rooms, Book Nook, and Desert Luxe.



I obviously can't do this for every single object, so I'm using my discretion to choose ones I think would be good Sales Displays for different kinds of businesses and decor styles.

That made me wonder, since Starbucks is like McDonald's in the world of coffee (vs specialty coffee roasters, small local coffee shops, etc.), why are there so many McDonald's but not that many Starbucks? While the customer segmentation doesn't overlap fully, I'd imagine it to be quite significant. Cultural reasons? Different business strategies?

I used to be someone who focused a lot on what was missing in my life. I‚Äôd scroll through social media and feel behind, unaccomplished, or just straight up not enough.

At first, it felt kinda forced. But over time, I noticed I was training my brain to look for good things during the day just so I‚Äôd have something to write down later. My mood improved. I complained less. I started seeing beauty in ordinary moments I used to ignore.

The biggest change? I realized my world didn‚Äôt have to drastically change for me to feel better in it‚ÄîI just had to start looking at it differently. That doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring problems or being toxically positive. It just means giving equal (if not more) attention to what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs beautiful, and what‚Äôs growing.

1jwpgjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingApp/comments/1jwpgjy/i_work_the_graveyard_shift_at_an_abandoned_mall/,I Work the Graveyard Shift at an abandoned Mall [Part 1 of 4],"**July 1st: ""The First Night""**

Welcome to the Graveyard Shift, eh! Honestly, I took the job because I needed the money. Simple as that. The mall‚Äôs been closed for years, left to rot like the rest of this town, but they still pay someone to keep an eye on it. A security guard to make sure no one breaks in: no homeless squatters, no teenage thrill-seekers trying to film some urban exploration nonsense. Just walk the empty halls, check the cameras, and clock out at sunrise.

Easy work.

Truth be known, the place isn‚Äôt in bad shape. Sure, there‚Äôs plenty of dust, and some of the neon signs flicker like they‚Äôve got a death rattle, but it‚Äôs not some crumbling ruin. Even the escalators still work when I flip the breaker. The air though, that smells like a ghost of the old food court: grease, stale cinnamon, something artificial.

Too fresh, to be honest.

You know what? I tell myself I imagined that part.

The floors are still polished enough to reflect the overhead lights, but they make the place look wrong: too bright in some spots, swallowed by shadows in others. A few storefronts still have old sale posters in the windows, frozen in time:¬†*BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!*¬†*FINAL CLEARANCE: EVERYTHING MUST GO!*

The last time I set foot in this place, I must have still been a teenager. Back then, it had life: shoppers hurrying between stores, kids loitering outside the arcade, the smell of cheap pizza and pretzels filling the air. That was before the crash. Before businesses dried up and moved elsewhere.

Now, it‚Äôs a corpse.

And I‚Äôm the one keeping watch over the body.

There are stories about this place, of course. Urban legends. Every town has them.

When I was younger, people whispered about shadows moving behind the storefront glass, voices coming from the empty food court, the occasional security guard who quit without explanation. I‚Äôd heard the usual ghost stories too, tales about the mall being built over burial grounds, old tunnels, places best left undisturbed. Back then, I‚Äôd laughed them off. Just dumb rumors. Now, standing alone in the middle of it all, I don‚Äôt feel like laughing. Still, I tell myself the same thing I did when I took the job: It‚Äôs just a building.

Nothing more.

I check my watch. 10:47 PM.

My shift officially starts at eleven, but I wanted to get here early. Get a feel for the place. The security office is near the old Sears, a windowless room with outdated monitors and a desk that smells like stale coffee. A single metal filing cabinet sits in the corner. It‚Äôs locked. The monitors flicker to life when I hit the switch. Twelve feeds in all. One for each wing of the mall, plus a few in the service corridors. Most show nothing but empty hallways, silent and still. The one outside the food court is the same, except for the occasional glitch, a static ripple crawling across the screen. I make a mental note to check the wiring later.

There‚Äôs an old logbook on the desk, the pages yellowed with time. I flip through it, scanning the last few entries.

June 23rd ‚Äì 2:14 AM:¬†*Heard something in the west corridor. Checked it out. Nothing there.*

June 24th ‚Äì 3:41 AM:¬†*Power flickered again. PA system made a noise. Almost like‚Ä¶ music?*

June 25th ‚Äì 4:02 AM:¬†*Saw movement on camera 3. No one there.*

Then, nothing. No more entries. Damn‚Ä¶ The last guard must have left in a hurry.

I grab my flashlight, clip my radio to my belt, and step out into the mall. It feels too quiet. Not just empty: hollow. The silence isn‚Äôt natural. It presses in on me, like the whole building is waiting for something. I shake the feeling off and start my first patrol.

The first hour is uneventful. I walk the halls, flashlight cutting through the dark. My footsteps echo back at me, the only sound in a place that once thrived with life. The food court tables are still set, as if waiting for customers who‚Äôll never come. The plastic chairs are slightly pulled out, frozen mid-motion, abandoned in a hurry. A few empty soda cups remain on the tables, lids sunken, straws discolored. I try not to think about how the janitors should have cleaned all this up before the mall shut down.

The mannequins in the department store windows stand like frozen spectators, blank faces staring out into nothing. Some are missing limbs. Others are dressed in outdated clothes‚Äîpastel polos, acid-¬† wash jeans. There‚Äôs something wrong about the way they stand. Not quite symmetrical. Not quite balanced.

I keep moving.

The neon sign outside an old RadioShack flickers when I pass. The bulbs hum, buzzing like trapped insects. The gate to the store is down and locked, has been for years. but inside, I swear I see movement.

Just a shadow. Could be my own reflection. I don‚Äôt stop to check.

It happens near the carousel. I pause to take a sip from my water bottle, leaning against the metal railing around the ride. The horses are faded, their once-¬† bright colors muted with dust. Then I hear it.

Faint mall music.

I straighten up, turning my head to listen. It‚Äôs distant, like a song playing from a speaker buried under concrete. Fuzzy, warped. A tune I almost recognize, but can‚Äôt quite place. The thing is‚Ä¶ the mall‚Äôs PA system is dead. I checked. The power is off. I grip my flashlight tighter, scanning the ceiling where the speakers are mounted. Nothing.

I tell myself it‚Äôs just sound traveling from outside. Maybe a car with the bass turned up, parked too close to the building. But the mall walls are thick. Too thick. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to hear anything. I take a slow step forward. The music is coming from deeper inside, past the carousel, down the wide corridor lined with empty storefronts. The song is half-familiar, like something I heard as a kid‚Äîan old commercial jingle, maybe. And then, it stops. Dead silence.

Like it was never there at all.

A chill runs down my spine, but I shake it off. Probably just my mind playing tricks on me. Still, I can‚Äôt help but check over my shoulder. I settle into the shift. I tell myself it‚Äôs just another night job. Walk the halls. Check the cameras. Ignore the way the darkness presses in at the edges of my flashlight‚Äôs beam.

Then the patterns start.

11:47 PM.

I pass the department store again, letting my light sweep over the display. The mannequins stand just like before, their plastic faces blank. I walk a little farther, pausing at the next storefront. The glass is covered in dust, reflecting my own tired face back at me.

Something nags at me.

I turn back to the department store window. One of the mannequins is different. Its head is tilted, just slightly, turned toward the path where I just walked. Like it‚Äôs watching. I hold my breath.

No. That‚Äôs not right.

I tell myself I must have missed it before. Maybe a trick of the shadows. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired. I keep moving.

12:20 AM.

At the security station, I check the monitors. The feeds flicker, switching between angles: grainy black- and- white shots of empty hallways. The upper level. The food court.

Then, static.

I frown. The cameras have been faulty for years, but something about the sudden glitch puts me on edge. The static clears. For half a second, I swear I see movement on the upper level. A figure, blurred by the distortion. My breath catches. I switch the feed back.

Nothing.

Just empty corridors and locked storefronts. I exhale slowly. I‚Äôm imagining things. I must be. Still, I feel colder than I did before.

1:04 AM.

I head toward the old bookstore, near the back of the mall. A wall clock still hangs just inside, its glass cracked, hands frozen in time. I shine my light on it as I pass.

4:02 AM.

I stop. That can‚Äôt be right. I check my watch. 1:04 AM. My stomach tightens. I take a step back. The cracked glass catches the light at a different angle. The hands haven‚Äôt moved. They‚Äôre stuck. I swallow hard and keep walking.

1:40 AM.

I loop back toward the security office. The department store window is on my right as I pass. I don‚Äôt want to look‚Ä¶ But I do. The mannequin that had its head tilted? Now, it‚Äôs facing the opposite direction. I stop. My pulse hammers in my ears. I know it wasn‚Äôt like that before. I would have noticed. A feeling settles in my chest‚Ä¶ deep, instinctual.

I am not alone.

I turn quickly, scanning the corridor behind me. My flashlight beam cuts through the dark‚Ä¶ Nothing.

No movement.

No sound.

Just the faint buzz of an old neon sign, flickering overhead. I tell myself to calm down. It‚Äôs just my imagination. But I pick up my pace anyway.

2:12 AM.

Back at the security station, I check the cameras again. The upper level feed glitches. For a fraction of a second, I see something in the distance. Not a person.

Not exactly.

A shape‚Ä¶ just at the edge of the frame. It disappears before I can process it. I feel cold all over. I switch the feed back.

Just me.

Just me in this whole empty mall.

3:00 AM.

I tell myself I‚Äôm being ridiculous. I need to prove it to myself. So I go for another walk- through. I check the food court. The loading bay. The abandoned arcade with its silent, screen-burnt machines. Everything is just as it should be. I start to feel better.

Then I see it.

The back hallway door, the one leading to storage rooms and old employee offices. It was locked earlier. Now, it‚Äôs open. A sliver of darkness yawns beyond the threshold. The air feels wrong‚Ä¶ too still, too expectant. I step closer, heart pounding.

Something is waiting.

I hesitate. I mean, it could be a mistake‚Ä¶ the lock was faulty, or someone forgot to secure it before the mall shut down. That‚Äôs what I tell myself. But my body doesn‚Äôt believe it. There‚Äôs a feeling in my gut, a tension winding its way into my limbs like a warning I don‚Äôt understand. Still, I step inside.

The hallway is longer than I remember. It should only be about twenty feet, a short stretch of bland corridor leading to the old employee offices and storage rooms. But as I walk, the air gets heavier, staler. I shine my flashlight along the floor. The tiles look different.

Older.

The linoleum pattern has changed: no longer the scuffed, off-white flooring I walked over earlier. This looks‚Ä¶ older than the rest of the mall. A darker color, worn down in strange patterns. Like hundreds of footsteps have passed through here over the years.

I stop.

Something feels off.

I glance behind me. The door I just walked through looks farther away than it should. The hallway seems‚Ä¶ stretched. No. That‚Äôs impossible. I keep moving. There‚Äôs another door ahead, standing slightly ajar. I don‚Äôt remember this one. It looks older, too‚Ä¶ a heavy wooden thing, completely out of place in a building from the 1980s. The paint is peeling, and the handle is an old-fashioned brass knob, the kind you‚Äôd see in a house from decades before the mall even existed. My flashlight catches movement inside. Just a flicker‚Ä¶ like something shifting in the dimness beyond. A trick of the air, I tell myself. Or maybe a rat. Yeah‚Ä¶ A rat.

I step closer.

Then, the PA system crackles to life. The sound cuts through the silence like a blade. A burst of static. Then a faint, distorted whisper.

My name.

I freeze.

My skin goes ice-cold. The PA system has been dead for years. I turn slowly, flashlight trembling in my grip. The hallway behind me looks wrong. It‚Äôs longer now. I can still see the door I came through, but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ farther away. Like I took twenty steps, but the distance doubled behind me. That‚Äôs not possible. I turn back to the open door. The darkness beyond it feels too deep.

Something is waiting.

I don‚Äôt go through. Not yet. Instead, I step back. I reach for the doorknob and pull it shut. The second the door clicks into place, the air feels lighter. Like I just slammed something out. I stand there for a long moment, heart hammering. Then I turn and head back the way I came. I don‚Äôt check the security cameras again. I don‚Äôt want to see what‚Äôs on them.

I sit at the security desk, rubbing a hand over my face. One more hour, that‚Äôs all. Just sixty minutes, and I can be out of here. I can go home, crawl into bed, and convince myself that nothing weird happened tonight. I glance at the monitors. Something‚Äôs different. I lean forward, staring at the grainy black-and-white feeds.

The mannequins have moved.

Not just one. All of them. Every mannequin in the department stores, the clothing boutiques, even the old window displays. They‚Äôre no longer in the positions I saw them in earlier. They‚Äôre facing the cameras now. Their blank plastic faces stare directly into the lenses. A cold sensation trickles down my spine. I swallow, scanning the feeds. I know they weren‚Äôt like that before. Earlier, they were arranged normally‚Ä¶ dressed in outdated fashion, mid- stride in fake promotional displays. But now‚Ä¶ Now they look posed.

Deliberate.

Like they‚Äôre watching me.

I don‚Äôt breathe. I don‚Äôt blink. I check another camera. The food court. The chairs have been rearranged. Before, they were scattered, some overturned, like they‚Äôd been abandoned in a rush. But now, they form a perfect circle. Neatly arranged. Symmetrical. I stare at the screen.

Who the hell‚Ä¶?

No.

No one‚Äôs here. I am alone. A chill creeps through my body. Something is wrong. I reach for the radio. Static hisses from the speaker before I even press the button. A whisper seeps through. I jerk my hand away. The whisper doesn‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs not words, exactly. Just a breath, drawn out, endless. The screens flicker.

Static.

A sharp burst of white noise blasts through the monitors, the kind of interference that makes your teeth ache. For a split second, I see it‚Ä¶ A figure. Standing just outside the security office.

Tall. Still. A silhouette against the glass door.

I spin around. The hallway outside is empty. I know what I saw. I whip back to the monitors. The static flickers again. The figure is closer. This time, I catch details. The shape of a man. A mall security uniform, just like mine. His head is tilted too far forward. I can‚Äôt see his face. My pulse pounds in my ears. Another flicker. He‚Äôs gone. The hallway behind me is still empty.

The power flickers. The overhead lights buzz, dim, then flare. The monitors flash to black. For a moment, I am completely blind.

Then‚Ä¶

The sound of footsteps. Slow. Measured. Coming from inside the security office. Behind me. I whip around. Nothing. The room is empty. The only sound is my own ragged breathing. The monitors blink back to life. The mannequins have moved again. They aren‚Äôt facing the cameras anymore.

They‚Äôre facing me.

I stand up so fast my chair scrapes against the floor. Enough‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done.

Whatever this is, my mind playing tricks, some elaborate prank, or something else, I don‚Äôt care anymore. I grab my flashlight, my radio, and my keys. One more sweep of the mall. Then I‚Äôm out.

I don‚Äôt finish my rounds‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt. My hands are still gripping the edge of the desk, knuckles white, but I don‚Äôt remember sitting back down. My breathing is uneven, my chest tight like something‚Äôs pressing against it. The monitors still show the mannequins.

Facing me‚Ä¶ Watching.

I tear my gaze away and force myself to stare at the far wall instead. I don‚Äôt check the cameras again. I don‚Äôt look at the food court. I don‚Äôt look at the mannequins. I sit in silence.

And I wait.

The PA system crackles. A soft, distant sound‚Ä¶ like someone breathing. I press my hands over my ears.

Not real.

Not real.

Not real.

I stare at the clock on the security desk.

3:57 AM.

Three more minutes. I can make it three more minutes.

I don‚Äôt move.

I don‚Äôt blink.

3:58 AM.

The lights overhead flicker. A shadow moves. Inside the room. I shut my eyes.

I won‚Äôt look.

3:59 AM.

My radio hisses with static. A voice comes through.

Not words.

A whisper.

I press my hands over my ears. I don‚Äôt listen.

4:00 AM.

A soft knock at the door. Just one. I stay perfectly still. The air in the security office feels wrong. Too heavy. Too thick. Like something else is here with me. I don‚Äôt turn around.

4:01 AM.

The whisper stops. Everything is silent. The lights hold steady. The air feels‚Ä¶ normal again. But I still don‚Äôt move.

Not yet.

4:02 AM.

The clock stops. A single blink‚Ä¶ then the numbers vanish. I hear the sound of the glass doors creaking open, but I haven‚Äôt moved yet.

It‚Äôs time to go.

I stand up, legs unsteady. I don‚Äôt check the cameras. I don‚Äôt look at the mannequins. I don‚Äôt look at the food court. I just walk. Through the hall, past the empty stores, toward the exit. The glass doors feel heavier than before, but I push them open, stepping out into the humid summer air. The heat presses against me, sweat beading on my forehead. For the first time all night, I breathe.

Then I get in my car, turning the key with shaking hands. The dashboard lights flicker on. The digital clock glows in the dark.

4:02 AM.

I never checked my watch. I never checked my phone. The security desk clock could‚Äôve been wrong. The car‚Äôs clock could be wrong. But I feel it in my bones: it‚Äôs not. Something changed inside that mall.

Or maybe‚Ä¶ I did.

Tomorrow night, I come back. I don‚Äôt want to. But I have to.

I grip the steering wheel, my breath slowing, heartbeat steadying. It‚Äôs over. At least for tonight. I throw the car into reverse, ready to leave this place behind‚Ä¶ And then my radio crackles. Not the mall‚Äôs radio. My car radio. A familiar tune starts playing. The same warped mall music from earlier.

My breath catches. I reach for the dial, twisting it all the way down‚Ä¶ But the music doesn‚Äôt stop. It just keeps playing. Faint. Muffled. Like it‚Äôs coming from under the seats. Like it‚Äôs coming from inside the car. The rearview mirror flickers. For a second, I swear I see movement. A shape in the backseat. I twist around, heart pounding‚Ä¶

Nothing.

Just an empty car.

But as I turn back to the wheel, I see it: my reflection in the rearview mirror. Only‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still sitting at the security desk.

The radio hisses‚Ä¶ then the music cuts out.

Silence.

I don‚Äôt breathe. I don‚Äôt move. Then, slowly, the clock on my dashboard changes. The glowing numbers shift, flickering, stuttering‚Ä¶ Until they settle on:

4:02 AM.

Again.

And again.

And again.

1jwpgcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jwpgcb/i_stayed_in_a_hotel_that_was_totally_abandoned/,I stayed in a hotel that was totally abandoned. Now I know why.,"A phone call came in with the sun and found me sleeping in a shitty hotel bed somewhere deep in the buttholes of southern New Jersey. My head hurt like hell, my stomach was about three seconds from turning, and I just wanted to get some rest. But motherfucking Todd couldn‚Äôt help himself. The dude was like a corporate wind up doll, born and bred in the basements of corporate America to wake up at the crack of dawn and take everybody‚Äôs money.



‚ÄúIt rained last night, right, Mike?‚Äù he coughed through a mouthful of menthol lozenges. ‚ÄúI heard water on the roof. And the wind. Jeez. The entire building shook like the devil himself was playing maracas!‚Äù



My memory took a few seconds to catch up with the conversation. We‚Äôd been driving all day, through the turnpikes and over endless skyline bridges that hovered high above the factories of the Northeast. We didn‚Äôt arrive at the dingy little inn until sometime around nine that night. The lights were all off. The lot was dark. It was drizzling, then, at least I thought as much.



‚ÄúAnyway, I went out for a cup of coffee this morning. The ground was bone dry. I can‚Äôt figure out why.‚Äù



An old alarm clock buzzed next to a row of empty bottles. The television blared white static. I wasn‚Äôt really listening. I couldn‚Äôt even find my pants. The room bore all of the typical signs of my personal downfall. A large, empty bag of potato chips was stationed by the refrigerator, with a case of Blue Moon carefully placed beside it. The mattress was soaked with sweat and the sheets were twisted about. It looked like somebody either had an exorcism or got drunk watching reruns of family comedies. Given my history, I settled on the latter.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even the weirdest part,‚Äù Todd whispered. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs here. I checked the halls, the lobby, bathrooms. The entire building is empty. It‚Äôs freaky.‚Äù



I took the comment with a grain of salt. Todd had a tendency to worry. That was actually putting it mildly. The man was a full-blown panicker. His fear of flying was the sole reason we were forced to drive five-hundred miles across the fuckin‚Äô country, shilling shitty software to worse people who didn't care all along the way. His anxieties weren‚Äôt even the worst part, it was the colossal arrogance that drove me up a wall more than anything else. He was one of those guys that seemed to take sadistic pleasure in competition with the GPS. Every wrong turn was a victory in the battle of Todd vs. the technology. That was how we ended up so far off the beaten path. Some people just don't want their tribal knowledge to be lost.¬†



I bet he could have stuck that quote in his corny little PowerPoint.



‚ÄúAre you ready yet?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúLet's go. I don‚Äôt like this place very much. Something about it gives me butterflies, and not the fun ones.‚Äù



As much as I hated to admit it, he wasn‚Äôt totally wrong. We booked the rooms through one of those shady discount travel sites, about an hour ahead of showing up there in the first place. The building seemed modern enough. The parking lot was well lit, and the lobby was decorated with hung plasma TVs and new furniture. But when we made it to the front desk to check in, there wasn‚Äôt a single person around to greet us.¬†



No clerks, no guests, nothing.



Just a single sign-in sheet, a stack of faded brochures, and a rack full of keys labeled in neat, faded handwriting. We grabbed two at random. Todd shuffled toward his room, and I found the minibar in mine. After that, things got hazy.



‚ÄúSeriously,‚Äù he snapped impatiently. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. I‚Äôll meet you in the lobby in five minutes.‚Äù



I gave it a second before I got out of bed. The nausea eased with a gulp from a plastic water bottle stashed under my pillow. The shower didn‚Äôt run, and neither did the sink, so that same bottle came in handy when I needed to brush my teeth. I finished getting ready and hated on myself in the mirror a little bit. I wasn‚Äôt the type to drink myself stupid. It was just a transition period. Nothing was bad. Nothing was good. I was just in a rut.¬†At least, that was the excuse.



We met by the checkout desk. Nothing had changed. The lobby was quiet and untouched. Chairs were still perfectly angled around fake plants, and the same stack of brochures sat patiently collecting dust on the counter. I looked around for a bathroom that actually worked, but before I could find it, pretentious sneakers squeaked down the hallway behind me.



""Welcome to scenic White Valley,"" Todd announced in his best radio voice. ""Home of absolutely nobody.""



He looked way too pleased with himself for a Monday morning. His checkered polo was buttoned all the way to his chubby little neckbeard, and he wasn‚Äôt wearing a tie or blazer, so it was a rare day off from the prototypical uniform. He struck me as the type of guy to read Business Insider‚Äôs column on how to ‚Äò\*blend in with your people\*‚Äô on the road. I guess the previous day's cuff links just weren‚Äôt cutting it. You could almost smell the effort in the form of Draco Noir.



‚ÄúAre you driving?‚Äù he sniffed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to take a nap.‚Äù



I looked around for a restroom first. The public one was on the far side of the atrium, past a row of planters and artwork in the form of abstract shapes and buzzwords. I left my bags with the human robot and made my way across the room. The floor was freshly polished, and each step clapped back off the walls with a sharp echo. Inside the bathroom was a single toilet. The tissue dispenser was empty, but the sink still worked. There wasn‚Äôt a signal on my phone, and the news was a day old. None of my calls or texts were going through. That didn‚Äôt seem out of the ordinary, though. There hadn‚Äôt been service for miles.



I finished cleaning up and stepped back out into the atrium. Something was off. Everything looked the same. The same tall windows. The same red paint and manicured furniture. But a detail had shifted. Maybe something in the air. I couldn‚Äôt quite tell what. Like the whole room had been rearranged when I wasn‚Äôt looking.



I turned a corner.



Then I saw her.



A woman stood beside Todd. She was older looking, with gray streaked white hair that hung past her shoulders, and eyebrows so thick they formed a single line across her brow. Her uniform didn‚Äôt match. I don‚Äôt know why I noticed that first, but I did. The shirt had one logo and the hat had another. Her pants were too tight, and rolls of stretch mark ridden skin leaned out the side of the gap in between her shirt.¬†



She didn‚Äôt say anything, initially, and that was the creepiest part of it all. She just sort of stared at me. Like she expected something to happen.¬†



Todd kept just as still. He shot me a quick look before his eyes dropped to the floor.¬†

‚ÄúMike,‚Äù he whispered when he talked. I realized then that I had never heard him be quiet about anything.¬† ‚ÄúI think we better do what this woman asks.‚Äù



I pulled the key out of my pocket and set it on the desk.



‚ÄúAlright. Does she want us to check out?‚Äù



No sooner than the words exited my mouth, a sharp screech ripped across the atrium, loud enough to force us to our knees. The tone shifted up and down in frequency. It was piercing one second, then rough the next. I couldn‚Äôt figure out where it came from until something dropped behind the front desk.



My attention shifted to the chalkboard.



That‚Äôs when I noticed the knife.



‚ÄúGo,‚Äù the woman grunted. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù



She dragged the blade across the board a second time. It was horrible. Todd screamed, but I couldn‚Äôt hear his words, I could only see his lips move. We got back up to our feet.

Then she pointed at the front door.



‚ÄúGo,‚Äù she repeated. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù



We got up and walked. The stranger followed.¬† I didn‚Äôt look back at her. I didn‚Äôt have to. I could feel her breath hot on my shoulders. Her steps fell into an uneven echo, like her shoes didn't fit, or she hadn‚Äôt moved in a while. I glanced over at Todd, and his normally polished eggshell had already begun to crack. Sweat gathered on his collar and soaked through the pits of his polo. His expression looked like the features on his face had frozen somewhere between apology and panic mode.



‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI don't know what we‚Äôve done to offend you. Just let us leave.‚Äù



The knife poked gently into my back.



‚ÄúGo.‚Äù



We kept it moving. The double doors led to a courtyard in front of the building. Outside, the garden was decorated with flowers and benches. The smell of fresh mulch felt like freedom. I could see our car in the lot. There was nobody else parked there. I hoped this mystery woman, fucked as she was, would simply let us get in and drive away. Maybe she thought we were trespassing, or whatever, but at least then we could put this whole knife-point encounter behind us.¬†



We marched in an awkward sort of procession, and after the first hundred steps, I was sure that we were home free. But just as Todd reached into his pocket to find his keys, the blade slashed across my peripheral vision. Fuzzy white dice fell to the ground. Bright red blood followed.



¬†‚ÄúGo.‚Äù



We walked on. Todd limped beside me. He was quiet, now. We left the parking lot behind after a few hundred feet. The manicured landscaping transitioned into a dirt path between dense trees. The forest was quiet. Branches crisscrossed overhead, low enough that we had to duck in places. The woman stayed behind us.



A hill rose out of the woods with the early morning fog right above it. We reached the crest.¬†



That was when the Valley opened up in earnest.



‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real‚Ä¶.‚Äù Todd mumbled out in front. ‚ÄúDoes nobody work in this town?‚Äù



A clearing about a mile wide spanned a gap in between the trees. Every inch of it was covered with people. There were parents with kids and folks in uniforms. There were wheelchair-bound patients in hospital gowns and beds with monitors and nurses attached. There were \*dozens\* of them, maybe hundreds, but not one of them said a thing.¬†



It was disturbing. They were the quietest group of people I had ever seen. Nobody coughed, nobody whispered, nobody laughed. They didn‚Äôt even seem to look at each other. The only sounds were the steady movement of their feet on the dirt and the soft rustle of clothing that brushed together.¬†

A weather-beaten brown building sat at the center of the clearing. It couldn‚Äôt have been taller than a couple of floors, no wider than about a hundred yards. There weren‚Äôt any roads that led to it. No walkways either. It looked like somebody had just taken the place and plopped it in the center of the valley.



The structure itself was in rough shape. Vines crawled across the face of the faded red brick. Weeds gathered around the foundation. The roof sagged in the middle, a drainpipe dangled from the side, and the windows were stained to the point where we couldn't see through, even in the daylight.



A sign over the awning read \*Library\* in chipped white lettering.



The woman pointed ahead, and we hustled down the hill to join the crowd. The group was packed tighter towards the front. The people seemed exhausted, or angry, even. Like the journey had taken everything out of them. Todd tiptoed beside a burly man in pajamas. I fell into line behind a mother and her two young children.



I tried to get them to look at me. The kids, the adults, anybody. I wanted to scream, but I could still feel the knife against my back, and every wrong move felt like it could cut my kidney right out of the fat.



‚ÄúMy daughter expects me to be home tonight,‚Äù Todd spoke plainly through the throngs of bodies. ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm gone.""



Nobody answered him. The townsfolk were restless by this point. Arms and shoulders pressed up against my back. One lady nearly nicked her hand on the knife. A row of heavy boulders had been laid out to form a path through the field. The formation funneled the people into a tight wedge near the door. But they weren‚Äôt moving. It was like they were stuck. The big man in pajamas shoved a gurney aside and forced his way to the front. He slammed on the oak exterior with his fist three times, in rhythm.



The double door swung open.



And then the crowd started to move.



The whole line broke apart. Parents ditched their families. Nurses abandoned their patients. The push from the back didn‚Äôt stop. A few people fell down next to the rocks. One of them was an older man with white hair and a gold tee-shirt ripped at the seams. He vanished beneath the weight of rushed footsteps and appeared again, face down in the dirt.



‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù I shouted over the chaos to the stranger behind us. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù



She glanced at me and smiled like it was obvious.



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hungry.‚Äù



The crowd rushed into the building like salmon headed upstream to spawn. Dust kicked up behind them. Floorboards creaked under the weight. The stampede was over in about ten seconds.

And then it was quiet.



A handful of people hadn‚Äôt made it inside. Some were moving. Some, like the old man, were not. I‚Äôll never forget the look of determination on a teenager with mangled legs and a row of bloodied cuts in his face. He dragged himself toward the door, inch by inch, until a last-minute straggler shoved him back down. His skull hit a rock with a sickening \*crack\*.



He didn‚Äôt move after that.



‚ÄúGo,‚Äù the woman gestured. ‚ÄúInside.‚Äù



We did what she told us. The inside of the library looked like it had been furnished by someone with a very small budget and a fond memory of the year 1997. The walls were pale green and covered in laminated newspaper clippings about science fairs and fundraisers. The chairs were upholstered in faded fabric and arranged around metal tables stacked with old magazines. An empty fish tank sat on a low shelf, but there wasn't any water, just a plastic log and a thin layer of gravel.



‚ÄúWhat the heck are we doing here?‚Äù Todd spat. ‚ÄúWe have a right to know.‚Äù



The stranger tilted her knife towards a staircase tucked into the back corner of the room. She seemed more agitated than before. Almost antsy. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she kept scratching her neck until the skin turned red. Her fingernails were peeled and bloodied. There was a look on her face like a crackhead hungry for a fix.



""Go.""



The air got hotter as we climbed. The steps rose above a long and narrow hallway where the mob had already vanished from view. At the top was a plain gray door with the word \*\*Storage\*\* labeled at the top. Our captor fiddled with the lock for a second. Then she poked the broad side of the blade into Todd's back.



‚ÄúInside.‚Äù



The room was small and slanted at the edges, almost like a makeshift attic office. A closet took up the far corner. Two narrow windows let in bright sunlight that illuminated a thin strip like tape across the wood paneling. The air smelled of old carpet and moldy paper, combined with something sharp and chemical.



‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù the woman shouted. ‚ÄúNo leave.‚Äù



And with that, the door slammed shut.¬†



A lock clicked behind it.



Todd paced around the narrow space in tight circles. His breathing got heavy. He swallowed hard and pressed a hand to his chest. He looked like he was about to pass out. For a second, I thought I was going to have to catch him.‚ÄúWe need a way out,‚Äù he babbled. ‚ÄúMike. We can‚Äôt stay up here. You understand that, right?‚Äù



I didn't say anything back. There had to be something useful in the room. Something we could use to defend ourselves, or help us escape. I tried the windows and they were rusted shut. I pressed my palm into the glass and shoved. Nothing moved.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are we going to do?‚ÄùThe closet was next. A cardboard box sat near the back with a faded Home Depot logo stamped on the side. I pulled it out and crouched to check the contents. Inside was a toolbox that looked like it hadn't been touched in years. A broken level sat beside a pair of pliers with the grip half melted. An old, rusted hammer rested on top.‚ÄúThis will work.‚ÄùI went back to the closet to take another look. A gap in the floorboards had opened where the toolbox had been. Pale light bled through the cracks. The smell coming off it was stronger than before, and it was thick with chemicals, something like bleach or melted plastic. It stung a little when I breathed it in.



‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù



At first, I thought it was the pipes. But the sound didn‚Äôt match anything I‚Äôd heard before. It was a rhythmic clicking, in steady, gurgling intervals. Almost like wet lips trying to keep time over a beat. I dropped down to the ground and pressed my eye to the gap in the floorboards. That‚Äôs when the room beneath us opened up, and I knew we‚Äôd stepped into something we weren‚Äôt meant to see.



""What is it?"" Todd snapped. ""What's happening?""



The main hall was massive, but everybody was gathered around the center. A row of pushed-together desks guarded three thick steel drums. A small group of young women in white moved between them in slow, deliberate circles. Each of them dragged long-handled ladles through the surface through pools of translucent orange liquid. The whole crowd watched them work in silence while the concoction bubbled like lava and melted cheese.



""Not sure,"" I muttered. ""Looks like they're lined up for something.""



A figure stepped into view from the furthest queue. I recognized the face. He was the same kid from earlier, the one who cracked his skull on the pavement. Something about the way he moved just seemed wrong. The bones in his legs bent at awkward angles. Each step was like watching a puppet try to figure out its strings. His face was pale and streaked with dried blood, but he didn't seem to mind the cuts and bruises, he just kept going, arms at his side, eyes ahead.



‚ÄúThis is weird,‚Äù I muttered out loud. ‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre getting ready to eat.""

The teenager shuffled in front of the vats. He seemed to be the first of the townsfolk to be seen by the lunch ladies from hell. They swarmed him in a group. One of them looked him up and down. Another sniffed him by the collarbone. Apparently satisfied with the result, the two of them scurried out of the way, while a third forced the kid down to his knees in front of the bile.



She lifted a utensil to his nose.



She pinched his nostrils.



She waited.



After a moment, a pale white slug forced itself free.



‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù I covered my mouth to keep from vomiting. ‚ÄúThis is sick.‚Äù



The woman caught the thing in her dish before she walked toward a smaller drum at the back of the room. She lowered it inside carefully, like it was made of glass.¬†

The kid went limp. One of the others stepped in behind him and gently dunked his head into the orange slop.



He screamed when the second slug emerged from the slime.



Then sobbed as it crawled across his mouth and up his nose.



‚ÄúThey're parasites,‚Äù I muddled my words trying to explain. ‚ÄúThey're inside of them...‚Äù

The kid twitched. His eyes rolled back. For a second, I thought he was about to collapse again. Then his whole body seized. He snapped upright and started laughing. It was a hysterical, panicked, frenzied sort of laughter. The type where you have to catch your breath in between. He bolted across the room and slammed his head into a wall. Then he bounced off and did it again. And again. He dropped to his knees and stared at the blood on his hands. Then he licked them. Slowly. As if he was savoring the taste.



Todd reached around me and pulled the hammer off the toolbox. I couldn‚Äôt stop him. Everything happened too fast. There wasn't any time to react. He stepped past me and smacked the window with one clean smash. The glass cracked and blew apart. Shards bounced across the floor.

I was still looking through the crack in the floorboards when the energy shifted. Every head in the hall below snapped toward me. Not toward the window. Not the noise. Me. Like they knew exactly where I was. Like they‚Äôd just been waiting for a reason.



And then they started to run.



The teenager was the fastest. He pushed the others out of the way as he dropped to all fours and sprinted to the door at the end of the long hallway. I got up and started to move myself. Todd was trying to force himself out of the window. But he didn‚Äôt quite fit. His pants were torn where the jagged pieces bit deep into his legs. His shirt was covered in red. He twisted hard, trying to shove through, but the frame scraped him raw. He yelled back at me as footsteps rushed up the steps. Then he turned around.



There was something evil in his eyes when he hit me.



I slammed into the floor hard. My head bounced against the tile, and everything got slow. My ears rang. My vision pulsed at the edges. I could still hear him moving somewhere above me. Todd. He was angry about something.



The door burst open.



The mob poured in.



The man in pajamas spotted him first. Todd had one foot out the window, but the cuff of his khakis was caught on the radiator. He couldn‚Äôt move. The big guy yanked him by the ankle and pulled him back inside. The rest of them screamed like animals. They clawed at his arms and dragged him across the floor. Todd kicked. He begged. He said he was sorry. He said he didn‚Äôt mean to. They didn‚Äôt care. They hauled him out the door and back down the stairs, still yelling, still pleading for me to come and save him.



And then it was quiet again.



I waited by the door for a few seconds. Just long enough to know they weren't coming back. The screams didn‚Äôt stop. They only got worse. Todd‚Äôs voice had turned hoarse and jagged, like he swallowed some sandpaper. There weren‚Äôt any words to be heard anymore, just guttural moans. The mob loved it. They made these horrible little noises. Snorts. Gasps. Something that almost sounded like applause. They were excited, now. And that horrific fucking clicking sound didn't stop, either. It only got louder.



I stepped through the doorway and into the hall. My legs wobbled. My skull throbbed. The world tilted every few steps, but I didn‚Äôt stop. I just walked.



Down the steps.



Through the library.



And out the front door.



For a moment, I felt guilty. I really did. But then I thought about the hammer. And those stupid fucking khakis. And all of the horribly condescending moments that led to the one when that cowardly, selfish little asshole tried to sacrifice \*me\* so that \*he\* could survive.



And then I just kept moving.



The woods were cold and dark, then. The early morning had given way to a gentle rain that slipped through the trees and clung to the branches. Mud sucked at my shoes. Branches scratched at my shoulders.



I followed the same path we took in and ended up in the field that led to the parking lot.¬†

Our car was still parked at the back.



I spotted the keys with the little white dice in the gravel where we left them, wet and smeared with blood. I picked them up, unlocked the door, and slid into the driver‚Äôs seat. I stared through the windshield for a while.



Then I started the car and drove away.



That night, I reported everything to the police in my hometown. I felt safer there. I expected they'd ask me more questions, maybe even think I had something to do with it. Maybe I did. I still couldn‚Äôt shake the guilt of leaving my coworker behind.

Before long, the secretary returned and told me they had located Todd. They spoke to him on the phone, and he was a little shaken up, but alive and well. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.



Two days later, a postcard arrived in the mail.

The catch tub of the used pods is a two part gizmo: one to hold the pods, with holes in it to let fluid go to the next part. The next part is like a tub to catch the excess fluid. 

Yesterday I noticed a big puddle around the machine , that was darkened with coffee. Took the tub out (had only one pod in it) and it was completely full. Dumped it and watched the overflow tube (with the tub removed) whilst making a cup of coffee. Wiped up the excess coffee fluid as it was making it.

When it started doing the steamed milk part a bunch of clear water started coming out and had to quickly wipe that up.

I feel that water is being siphoned out of the water tank.

I am going to monitor the amount of fluid that the tub captures for one pod. And report back.

It's somewhat special, on a lake in a large city in NC, probably fetch $500-600 k.  House was 2400 ft but I've added 400 ft downstairs master suite.  Always wanted a better kitchen (larger) and the fricken laundry room was built under the staircase.  I hate that the only cooking ventilation is one of those ridiculous over the stove microwave recirculating fans.  No way to get it outside.  

Working with a GC and cabinet designer who came up with what I think is an excellent design.  We rarely use dining room and same w living room (family room large and open to kitchen.  Design will expand kitchen, removing load bearing wall to dining room (supports both ways, 14 ft, so major effort).  Dining room moves to living room.  Also has upstairs plumbing drain through it that has to move.  Kitchen would be way big so she came up with outstanding laundry room to take some of room in lost dining room (lots of cabinets, folding table).  The current laundry would become pantry and location of coffee grinder, maker, and espresso to clean up kitchen.  Huge island, retains all windows to lake, refinish wood floors.  Double wall ovens, decent hood to outside.  I'd say pretty high end cabinets.  My guess is we'd be putting a kitchen in belonging to a 1-1.5 million house in this area.  Without appliances (Wolf and S Zero) we're up to 150,000.  I've gulped at that, but can afford it.  Also done stuff myself but too old now.  More I read on web the more it seems kind of reasonable.  Probably add $40k appliances.  It's more that the house would normally justify, but with lake view I think the premium will earn a lot of value (and joy for me).  The value will be split w my kids when I cross over anyway, not my deal.

Does this seem reasonable?    New well done bigger kitchen w bells and whistles, new functional laundry room, create a pantry, but lose a wall and formal living room for \~$200,000 in a $500-600 house?

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1jwpdle,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1jwpdle/lack_of_traction/,Lack of Traction,"The last month for me has been rough, like the kind of rough that slowly creeps in, starts as fatigue, then lack of motivation, then it all ignites and from one day to the next and I have a headache, could eat a whole bag of chips and I feel like my life is out of control (when maybe it really isn't). Basically, stress.

Recently I took a job that has turned out to be bad - long story short, I have a female boss who is lazy, mediocre and doesn't follow through on promises to the point that it gets in the way of everyone else. The pay is great, the work life balance is manageable ... but this woman drives me straight up a wall even on days that I've already done my yoga and had 2 cups of coffee. 

Earlier in my life I would have just doubled down on my life outside of work and let this go. Think hobbies, dating, friends and family etc. But in the last year, I suffered a health crisis and during that time had to change my life alot. I lost alot of friends that were partying way too hard for our mid-30s. I have gone through alot of rejection dating on the apps, even though I'm an eligible date. And, alot of my hobbies are solitary (making jewelry and cycling). My life isn't terribly bad but I feel this lack of traction and momentum. Like even if I take action, nothing moves forward.

He's constantly exhausted and lonely, lately he's been taking Ozempic and has lost some weight and has more energy and feels the need to as he says try and make friends with people. He has talked to my mother about this and she is happy for him to make friends and be supported.

Problem is, when this whole situation was first highlighted he was very cagey about even talking about this ( we are very close and tell each other grim details, we arnt embarrassed about anything) and was very vague about who he was meeting for coffee or what the situation was, what they were called ect, so this naturally sent alarm Bells ringing, as this is very out of character for my father. He has said and remains this is innocent and just wants company.

I knew deep down in my heart that something was right about what he was saying and my brain has overthought every possible outcome and I've lost sleep about this.

Today he went to meet a lady so I grabbed his iPad which I shouldn't have done as its not my business, and lone behold he's on various dating sites, not support groups, talking to several women, oddly saying flirty things and seems like a chat that not that friendly I.e. ""sexy lips"" and ect to her photos. He's married.

If I confront him about this we are going to fall out and he's too old and doesn't have all the time in the world left, but he's disrespecting my mother and if she knew the grim details she wouldn't be happy either, 
This is hard to live with to be honest as he is vulnerable and does have alot of money in the bank, and he's generous aswell. Don't want him to be hurt or taken advantage of, but he needs company and remains its just friendly. All very disgressing

Since I was a child I used to drink a big 2 liters Coke bottle every day. As soon as I grow up a little I started getting into coffee.

With perspective of time now I understand that I was using caffeine as a way to come down to earth. As i was most of the time totally dissociated, daydreaming, and sleepy caffeine became a natural way to be able to survive in society. 

At the same time, i was able to recognise my adhd because caffeine triggered me the H of adhd so my impulsiveness showed up. 

I spend almost my entire life addicted to any kind of legal stimulant: caffe, tea, red bull, monster, mate, pure dark cocoa etc etc. I could even make the difference between the effect of each one. How caffe made me reactive and aggresive, cocoa made me feel euphoria and red bull was coffe without the tremors and agressivenes of caffe etc etc.

Now I‚Äòm on my way to get rid lf caffeine because I experienced a strong exhaustion after regular caffeine intake. Instead of giving me energy caffeine was just letting me be awake for a short and depleting my energy storage. 

Doing my best to navigate throught this new situation and feeling like I‚Äôm having real issues to have a normative life without caffeine but not wanting to go back to the previous situation of energy depletion and impulsiveness. I would like to know your experiences on it. Thanks in advance :)

Imagine you‚Äôre standing in front of two doors: one leads to the world of residential clients, and the other swings open to commercial giants. They both need eco-friendly solutions, but they speak their own unique languages. It‚Äôs like being bilingual in the world of green marketing‚Äîand trust me, when you translate your offer into something that resonates, your message gets a lot louder.

Now, when you're targeting residential clients, picture this scenario: a family apron-clad around a grill in their backyard, reveling in the green garden they‚Äôve cultivated through your eco-friendly products. You want them to visualize that lush, happy home, bursting with flowers and a sense of responsibility towards Mother Earth. Share those tangible before-and-after transformations on social media. One photo of a dreary yard turned into a vibrant green paradise speaks volumes, creating a story that folks can relate to.

And then there‚Äôs the commercial side. Think big: soaring office buildings, bustling coffee shops, and swanky restaurants that want to promote their eco-cred. Here, the pitch changes a bit. You‚Äôre not just selling products; you‚Äôre offering a whole new image. Show how your solutions can save them money in the long run. Showcase case studies of businesses that reduced costs and increased customer footfall just by going green‚Äîit‚Äôs like turning a lightweight into a heavyweight champion in the sustainability arena.

Now, let‚Äôs get to the fun part‚Äîsocial media. This is where the magic happens. Use platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn to share eye-popping visuals and compelling narratives. Capture the look of satisfaction on a homeowner‚Äôs face when they see their electric bill drop. Or showcase a corporate client proudly flaunting their new eco-friendly facade with a tag line like, ‚ÄúSaving the planet, one square foot at a time.‚Äù Create posts that are vibrant, colorful, and, most importantly, tell a story. An engaging video series could even walk potential clients through the eco-friendly process step by step, demystifying everything from solar panel installation to composting systems.

Remember, behind every like and follow is a real person. Engage with your audience. Ask questions. Create polls. Maybe put up a humorous meme about the difference between being eco-conscious and just being ‚Äòeco-confused.‚Äô It‚Äôs this interaction that builds community‚Äîpeople want to feel like they‚Äôre part of a movement, not just numbers in a marketing report.

And speaking of community, consider local partnerships. Collaborate with influencers or eco-conscious community leaders who share your vision. They can help amplify your message and reach audiences you might not have tapped into yet. This is especially powerful for small businesses looking to make their mark. 

As you weave your marketing strategies together, remember that eco-friendly solutions aren‚Äôt just a business; they‚Äôre a lifestyle and a movement. Be the torchbearer guiding your community toward a greener future. Mix in a healthy dose of humor, authenticity, and soul, and you‚Äôll find yourself crafting a narrative that not only sells but genuinely inspires change.

I take desogestrel contraceptives to manage my periods, since May 2024. I occasionally take over-the-counter iron supplements and Vitamin D3 supplements following blood tests that flagged these as a bit lower than ideal levels - take these around 3 times a week when i remember. I vape low nicotine sometimes, and drink maybe 2 alcoholic drinks around once a month. 

Currently investigating digestive issues i have had since November 2024, currently doing a food tracker/ low FODMAP elimination diet to investigate IBS as an option. Ruled out celiac, chrons, ulcerative colitis. This is not what this post is about, but not sure if it is relevant.

Current issue is urinary urgency and frequency experienced for the last 3 weeks. I have no building urge to urinate like i used to, i just go from no urge to desperate within 2-5 minutes. If i do not get to a bathroom within 5 minutes of that, i experience some incontinence - so far just a few drops. I wear a liner just in case. 

I also need to urinate around every 60-70 minutes, when i used to go around 2-5 hours between bathroom uses depending on what i was doing or drinking. I urinate what feels like a regular or large amount for such small intervals between using the bathroom, so its not like it feels like i need to pee and nothing comes out. There is no pain when urinating, my urine is a regular clear pale yellow. Sometimes there is an oily sheen to the water after i urinate.

I went to my GP this week, had a urine test done in the office with a dip stick. GP said i had some very mild infection markers and prescribed Nitrofurantoin 100mg, 2 times daily for 3 days. I have finished this course and have seen no change in frequency or urgency, still needing to go hourly and still being hit out of nowhere by the urge. 
My urine sample was also sent to the lab and i was told it was normal. Results below:

Clinical details: ?UTI

Current Antibiotics: Nitrofurantoin

Possible relevant background: when I started my adhd medication in January, i experienced dry mouth as a side effect, so started drinking more water, when before i definitely did not drink enough. This increased how much i needed to pee, and how often, but not significantly. That fluid intake has been pretty stable since January, i have 1 cup of coffee in the morning and only drink water the rest of the day. Usually around 2L a day. This has not changed in the last 3 weeks, whilst my urination has increased a lot. 

Please could you guys help me to know what questions i should be asking when I follow up with my GP, and what information given here might be relevant to this follow-up?

Editing to add things i forgot: 
I often feel like my bladder is not fully empty when i urinate, and if i stay on the toilet another few minutes i can usually pee again a small amount, which helps feel empty.

I also wake up once every single night to pee, usually around 2 hours after i have gone to sleep (around midnight). I then wake up around 7am desperate to pee again, but do not wake up between midnight and 7am. I have so far not had any nighttime incontinence, but have had a small amount when getting to the bathroom at my 7am wakeup ",1,1744376204.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

‚Ä¢	‚Å†30 to 50dh for lunch
‚Ä¢	‚Å†14dh for coffee
‚Ä¢	‚Å†20 to 30 dh for gas

Ha9 mchat 100dh this is too fkin much. For a country li smig fih 3000dh.

I feel like it‚Äôs practically impossible to survive in this city ( ila bghiti tssken rassk) without a min salary of 20000dh. Which i know it‚Äôs not impossible but cmon who‚Äôs getting payed that much for an entry job just after graduating university.

Edit: I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs comments and advice on how to save up more i know u r all trying to help and i get it but that‚Äôs not the point of this post,trust me i tried saving up for months but every time i do go super saving mode and only eating at home and trying to spend 0 dh if it's not absolutely necessary. But at the end i just feel like im depressing myself just to save a couple hundred bucks and for what im not trying to waste my 20s just to feel like im saving up some money that im not allowed to spend. And i mean let's be honest we go to school for like 20 years in hopes of finally growing up and achieving some independence and finally be able to buy small things we always wanted .But now that we are finished with school surprise surprise everything is super expensive and unless ur not making 10k+ a month ur screwed.

A little sharing of the day, between two coffees and three reports: I redid a calculation that I had already done when I started as a self-employed person, and it gave me a cold sweat again.

If you want to be an independent architect completely legally (and with professional software), here is what it looks like per month:

AutoCAD (plans): ‚Ç¨394

Adobe Suite (editing + layout): ‚Ç¨67

3DS Max (3D): ‚Ç¨288

...I'll let you do the annual calculation, there are too many zeros for me. (‚Ç¨9000 per year üòÅ)

Fortunately, I found some solutions:
For 3D: Blender To replace Adobe: Affinity (incidentally, share this software in schools and for independent hyper-powerful European software)

But I'm still stuck on the plan/CAD part.
Do you have affordable alternatives, open source or with lifetime licenses, to replace AutoCAD?

Otherwise, let‚Äôs say that a little ‚Äúoff the record‚Äù boost for a version of AutoCAD on Windows 10 or Mac M1 for personal use would also be welcome‚Ä¶ you get the idea? If someone could share the info with me üòÅ

Thank you in advance to those who have tips, good tips or feedback to share!
I wish you a nice day

**May 19**

I get changed for the club. A red-headed ‚Äúexpert‚Äù I know says that this red tube dress along with these heels and this black jacket are all I need to make men weak. I mean, okay?¬† Yes, the ass is perfect, but I still have to contend with this face. This nose is a little crooked. Been broken more than once. Luckily, the sleeves cover my arms.¬† Jackie understands that I almost always wear long sleeves for a reason. She‚Äôs always looking out for me. ¬†¬†

Speaking of, she walks in and goes over to her locker. Winking at me, she pulls out a bag and walks over to the small employee restroom, closing the door behind her. I get to applying makeup to get that ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor then I wait.

She‚Äôs wearing almost the same outfit. Her dress is dark blue. The jacket is also black. The difference in our proportions is almost comical. I am thin, some small curves, a ‚Äúperfect ass,‚Äù and 6+ feet tall next to a 5‚Äô6‚Äù bombshell that has curves which make men stop and gawk. Add her ‚Äúfuck me‚Äù heels and she is going to kill it. Her hair is curly and to her shoulders, mine is a simple bob.¬† I stopped growing mine out before I was 20. Harder to grab and get dragged around by.¬† Her make up brings out her blue eyes and her lips.

She smiles at me. ‚ÄúLooking stunning girl.¬† Let‚Äôs get you some make up and then we can head out!‚Äù

Once I have had far too much stuff done to me, I walk out of the back to head for the club. *WHY IS THERE AN AUDIENCE HERE?!?!*

Oberon, Todd, and Pat are all waiting around. Oberon starts to whistle.¬† Pat is wearing black pants, a similar jacket to ours and a loose shirt. A hint of cleavage is showing.

‚ÄúI invited Pat and Cindy, that okay? Cindy will meet us there.‚Äù¬† I nod. Both are always so much fun.¬†

Oberon is almost done with his whistle. Todd is taking pics. ‚ÄúOh hey, can you turn around Pat?¬† The guys I hang out with didn‚Äôt believe me when I said your ass was top notch.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think there were flames around me as I glared at him and Oberon finished his whistle, but I can‚Äôt be sure.¬† He did step back a bit.¬† I then flash a smile and turn around. Before his phone can come up for a picture I turn around again.¬† ‚ÄúSo sorry you missed it.‚Äù

He laughs and walks up. He then smiles at me and puts a necklace around my neck. I am stunned. He knows better than giving any of us presents. ‚ÄúThis is a charm that will make those whom would do you harm not notice you. I know a gift is a big thing. I would ask that for your gift you simply give me a chance to take that pic?‚Äù¬† We smile and wink.

I laugh.¬† I touch it and feel warmth. This is a phenomenal gift. I am seriously touched by this. I turn and give him an over the shoulder wink while throwing up a peace sign so he can take a pic of my rear. Jackie jumps in and does the same.¬†¬† I then walk up. ‚ÄúThat was not a fair exchange. Here, thank you.‚Äù¬† I kiss him on the cheek. He jumps back.

*She really is a goddess.* I laugh and wink. ‚ÄúI heard that.‚Äù

He walks up to Jackie and puts a similar pendant on her. ‚ÄúI had planned to ask you for a hug but now I have this to exchange for that picture.¬† May you also be protected.‚Äù

She laughs. ‚ÄúLike you wouldn‚Äôt get one anyway. Todd, I like you!‚Äù¬† She jumps up and hugs and kisses him on the cheek. He looks ready to die happy. *Can‚Äôt blame him*.

Jackie grabs both mine and Pat‚Äôs arms and says to go. We wave to everyone on our clubbing adventure. ‚ÄúHeh, Pat sandwich‚Ä¶‚Äù. I shake my head at her.

Behind me I hear a slapping noise and a little ‚Äúow‚Äù as Oberon begins to compliment Todd on his actions. I think there‚Äôs no jealousy or malice. Just admiration. I have to admit, Todd has been a great fellow of late and as long as you give him back as much as he gives you, he seems to not just to respect you, but to like you.¬† I catch a ‚Äúwhat sort of favor did you have to deal with for‚Ä¶‚Äù before we the door closes and I cannot hear them anymore.¬† I hope the hug was enough to make up for it.¬†

The trip to the club gets us not many stares. Pat vapes and her voice is scratchy again.¬† I shake my head at her habit.¬† Even with our outfits, we don‚Äôt stand out very much.¬† Friday night in the city has people way more dressed to the gills, pun intended, than us.

We get in line and start chatting. Pat feels a little worried. The line is mostly men.¬† Her voice is back to normal again, though, so I am glad.¬† I wonder if there isn‚Äôt some sort of charm like I have that can help.¬† Or a patch or something.¬† I will have to ask and maybe call in a favor. Worth it if I can find a thing that leaves one of my besties happy. Jackie give me an eye motion and I look at the pair of guys she is looking for. I give a ‚Äúnot bad‚Äù look and then mention that we will need a third as we have three as well.

Pat puts their hands up. ‚ÄúNo, no.¬† I am not taking a mortal for dinner or anything.‚Äù

I look at Pat, ‚ÄúBy ‚Äòfor dinner‚Äô you mean out for dinner or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

She looks me right in the eyes ‚ÄúEat them, of course. Men are delicious.‚Äù The tone is bloodthristy as fuck.

Jackie breaks out laughing. ‚ÄúPlease tell me that was a joke because I couldn‚Äôt handle it if you were a man eater.‚Äù

Pat smiles. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Ä¶‚Äù. That long pause is far too loaded.

Jackie goes stone quiet and looks shocked. Her eyes are wide as saucers. Mine are too, I bet.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt. Yet. I mean, if I want a kid doing that is the most efficient way to get one, right? Mom said so, along with the delicious part.¬† You have sex, get pregnant, and eat the father so he can‚Äôt steal the child.‚Äù

Jackie and I laugh.¬† She follows that with, ‚ÄúOh darling, all you have to do to avoid him stealing your kid is tell him you want commitment and sound crazy doing it. Bonus if you tell him he smells nice, and you want to be bathed in his smell forever and then take up his offer to move in and be his live-in girlfriend on the first date.‚Äù

Pat almost pees herself laughing. ‚ÄúThat was very specific Jackie.‚Äù

Jackie looks embarrassed.¬† ‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶‚Äù

I try to dig up why this sounds familiar and draw a blank.¬† I don‚Äôt think about it too much as we are now first in line. Both the others get IDed. *I feel insulted.*

Jackie pipes in ‚ÄúNot carding the bombshell?‚Äù Pat is pointing at me.

He shrugs and appears to notice me for the first time.¬† He asks for my ID. He looks surprised. He looks me up and down quite a bit.¬† He licks his lips a little.¬† *Why am I scared?*¬† I feel a warmth.¬† He stops caring about me almost immediately after handing my ID back. *Maybe I was imagining it. I guess I just look like a hag?*

He lets the other two in and ignores me. Asshole!¬† ¬†I scoot passed him and walk in without a comment.¬† The place is insane.¬† Lights are crazy. Tons of people making out all over the place. I am pretty sure I see a drug exchange and some maybe topless woman is getting quite a bit of attention in a corner.¬† Ah, New York. Never change.

The song ends and a hilarious choice is made. The Blade theme from the first movie starts up. I, being a complete weirdo thanks to my dad, know this one. Jackie, thanks to movie nights with me, does too.¬† We start bouncing to the beat.

Jackie leans over ‚ÄúIf blood starts pouring out of the sprinkler system, I am gonna be pissed.‚Äù¬† I laugh. She then yells out to Pat ‚ÄúHey, do you know if there are any vampires in the club?‚Äù

Pat laughs at that. ‚ÄúThere haven‚Äôt been many vampires left since the great prank of 2018.‚Äù Pat sees us staring at one another like she is crazy.

She motions us to follow her and we all head into a booth.¬† ‚ÄúSo, someone, not mentioning names, convinced the Vampire council that all their powers and weaknesses worked just as much on belief as they do for Fae.¬† And they worked on this for almost a decade. Doing things that made it seem not just plausible, but definite.¬† That same someone then convinced them that if they set up a battle with some werewolves in a field in the day, they could walk out of there the victors and sparkling, using the power of belief to their advantage.

Jackie and I are now seated with Pat and you could not get us to leave if you attacked us. We do pause to order drinks.¬† A guy starts walking towards us and then turns and walks away, shaking his head.

‚ÄúAnyway, the sky was so thickly overcast that day that it was practically nighttime. The vamps and werewolves all get in a field and then the storm ends and a break in the clouds opens to shine a sun beam directly on everyone in the fight.‚Äù

I giggle. ‚ÄúTime to break out the s‚Äômores?

Pat, who has been giggling this entire time, almost falls off her seat.¬† Nodding she wipes tears from her eyes and say, ‚ÄúOH MY GOD, I CAN SHOW YOU!!!‚Äù

Pat gets her phone and goes onto a website. The video is titled ‚Äúhigh speed special effects for vampires in daylight, Central Park.¬† Created by Puck.‚Äù¬† I realize this lets those that know enjoy the show without people believing it is real.¬† Nice move‚Ä¶ Puck.¬† Two guys who were about to say hi to us turn and walk away, shaking their heads.¬† My pendant feels warm.¬† Oh. OH!¬† Holy fuck.¬† The bouncer too?

We watch the thing from around 10 different cameras.

Jackie whistles. ‚ÄúRemind me never to piss off Puck. Or even get on his radar. That is just a masterwork!‚Äù

A trio of guys walk up. They are Tailor, the guy that seems to take the lead, cute, shorter than me by a little, great smile. Next to him is tall dark and gorgeous. I mean Ricardo. Man is a snack. And finally, Hector. He is nervous but seems to have kind eyes. They immediately start talking to us and ask if we are locals or visiting.

‚ÄúLocals, I‚Äôm a student, she is a small business owner, and Pat‚Ä¶ what do you do?‚Äù

Pat laughs and responds ‚ÄúWork and drink coffee. Sometimes I go home.¬† Not often.‚Äù¬† The laugh is melodious.¬† I hear the truth behind it.¬†¬† *I am going to have to know more about that.*

We talk and have drinks for over an hour.¬† Cindy shows up in there. I haven‚Äôt seen her since she helped us move Jackie out of the dorms.¬† We catch up a bit.¬† The group is pretty awesome. Hector is obviously into Pat. She seems receptive to hanging out and gives him her phone number. Tailor is kinda not sure if he is more attracted to Jackie or Cindy. Dude needs to make up his mind. And Ricardo?¬† Damn. I haven‚Äôt felt this pursued since 10^(th) grade. He is so sweet.

Jackie asks if they can excuse us and we all head to the restroom.¬†¬† Both she and Pat grab my hands. ‚ÄúTall, dark, and gorgeous wants to jump you.‚Äù¬† Jackie is very sure of herself. Pat chimes in ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs showing every sign of arousal every time he looks at you. If you want to have him inject you with his seed and leave, he‚Äôd be willing to!‚Äù

At least 4 other women in the bathroom start laughing. I join them.

Cindy chimes in, ‚ÄúThat man is a snack. Like, if I wasn‚Äôt here to get in Jackie‚Äôs panties I would be all over him. I mean Tailor‚Äôs nice, but aside from you three, that is the only person here I‚Äôd let shove my panties into my mouth as a gag.‚Äù Jackie blushes as she points to her when she says her name. The other gals are having a riot.

‚ÄúLadies, I am here to have a good time with you‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jackie gets on her tip toes. ‚ÄúYou have not had a man over or stayed out all night once since we started living together. You need a good fucking.¬† He doesn‚Äôt have to be Mr Right, he can be Mr Right now.‚Äù¬† I can feel some hesitation.¬† She‚Äôs worrying about my safety.¬† I love her for that.

I nearly give myself a coughing fit laughing. Some other women have gotten in on this conversation.¬† ‚ÄúGet him girl!‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúYou got needs!‚Äù

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt do one night stands very often, okay?¬† I kinda came here looking for one but it is still a little‚Ä¶¬† Maybe I can get his phone number?‚Äù

‚ÄúAsk him for it when you roll over in bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúJACQUELINE!‚Äù

‚ÄúPATRICIA!‚Äù¬† Her smile is infectious.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out and see how things develop.‚Äù¬† *I am SUPER horny‚Ä¶*

She narrows her eyes. ‚ÄúGood.¬† They better develop with my bestie getting some.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I will.‚Äù¬† I hug her from behind and put my head on her shoulder. ‚ÄúSeriously, he is cute. You are the best.‚Äù¬† She grabs my hand and looks up at me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you forget it.‚Äù¬† Her smile is so warm it almost hurts.¬† ‚ÄúNow about using your panties as a gag‚Ä¶?‚Äù¬† Cindy blushes as Jackie walks up and kisses her. ‚ÄúLater.‚Äù¬† There are a lot of woman hollering now. I laugh. Pat is blushing more than Cindy.

We all step out go back to our table.¬† A few more rounds of drinks, some fun dancing and a great time later, I am exhausted. Ricardo is still here. He leans in close to talk to me.¬† ‚ÄúWhat say we take this to my place?‚Äù¬† I look over at Jackie and she is totally digging the attention she is getting from Tailor and Cindy. I get the feeling that all three would be happy to walk out with either of the other two. Maybe both.¬† Heh.

‚ÄúThat would be great. Let me tell my gal here.‚Äù¬† I move a bit to get around Cindy and talk to Jackie‚Äôs ear almost directly. ‚ÄúBabe, I am going to grab something to eat with Ricardo. Looks like I would get in your way. Enjoy some time with either or both of these two. I am sure they will with you.¬† Love ya.‚Äù¬† I give her a kiss on the cheek and grab Ricardo‚Äôs hand.

A wave of jealousy hits me. I look back and Cindy is looking at me. Did she get jealous of my kissing Jackie? Or of me and Ricardo?¬† Either way, yikes.¬† I am picking up more emotions of late.¬†

**May 20**

I wake up and stretch my arms.¬† Wait, this is not my bed.¬† Oh yea‚Ä¶ I turn and look at Ricardo.¬† He‚Äôs still sleeping.¬† I wonder if the clich√© walk of shame is the best move here.¬† I reject that.¬† Instead, I go pee, put on just my panties, and look in his kitchen.¬† I am on a mission.¬† He has eggs, bacon, and some cheese.¬† Most importantly, I find an apron.¬† Oh, this should get some of his fantasies checked off.¬† I have omelets going be the time he walks in, naked.¬† *Delicious.*¬†

‚ÄúSmells wonderful.‚Äù¬† He grabs a strip of bacon and while chewing it I can feel his eyes all over my backside.¬† ‚ÄúI really missed out on admiring that ass last night, damn.¬† Shame you are wearing panties‚Ä¶‚Äù

I look over my shoulder and wink.¬† ‚ÄúHoping to bend me over the counter in this apron?‚Äù¬† He laughs and walks over.¬† I get the omelets off the burner in time for them not to get burnt as we continue from last night.¬† His hopes are realized.

Hours later I have a phone number, a date for next week, and a taxi ride home because I am not going on a bus dressed like this.¬† The driver doesn‚Äôt mention it, he has seen it all.¬† Ah, the big city is awesome.

I open the door quietly and walk into the apartment.¬† I see Cindy on the couch, flipping through tv channels wearing close to nothing and I hear that the shower is going.¬† I am a little surprised, but not a lot\*.\*¬† ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù¬† I wave to Cindy as I walkthrough the living room to my room.¬† I guess the gagging thing won the night.

She gets up and follows me.¬† ‚ÄúHey, can we talk?‚Äù¬† I nod.¬† I also wonder what this is about.¬† ‚ÄúI really like Jackie, and I was wondering if it was okay if we could date‚Ä¶‚Äù

The look on my face must have spoken volumes as to my confusion.¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an adult and can date whomever she wants.¬† Why would you need me to say yes?¬† I know I am kind of like a big sister to her and all, but she is a firestorm.¬† She goes where she wants.‚Äù

Cindy looks at me and smiles.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, thanks.¬† She said she wanted to talk with you when you got home.¬† Just go in.‚Äù¬† She waves as she walks back to the couch.

I walk into the shower.¬† *Keep your eyes closed Pat, just in case. ¬†You have managed to avoid seeing her nude for months. I know I am being a bit of a prude, but I was an only kid and mom had nudity hang ups. I guess I got them too.*¬† ¬†I announce myself.¬† I hear a laugh in response.

‚ÄúAre you trying not to look at me in here?¬† Don‚Äôt worry, both curtains are drawn.‚Äù¬† She laughs.

I open my eyes.¬† She wasn‚Äôt lying.¬† Good, no need to make things weird.¬† ‚ÄúYou wanted to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like Cindy and wanted to make sure it was okay for her to visit.‚Äù¬† She actually sounds a little worried here.¬†

‚ÄúJackie, I said this to her as well, you can date whomever you want.¬† I have no say in this.‚Äù¬† I feel the apprehension coming from the shower.¬† The water stops.

‚ÄúOh, but you do.‚Äù¬† She pauses.¬† The curtains fly open and I am really not ready for this.¬† She grabs a towel to wipe herself off.¬† Before she does‚Ä¶¬† *Natural ginger‚Ä¶.*

¬†I had managed to avoid seeing her naked for 2 months.¬† Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have avoided it. Cuz damn. ¬†*I guess I am now 75% straight?¬† That sight knocked 25% off in one shot‚Ä¶ talk about bi-awakenings. STOP PAT.*

She laughs at my flustering.¬† ‚ÄúBonehead, we both live here.¬† I owe my job, this place, and a good portion of my happiness to you.¬† If you are not comfortable with someone being in **our** home, they will not be.‚Äù

I find myself tearing up.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, fine.¬† Look, she is fine.¬† She is a lot of fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, that‚Äôs settled.‚Äù¬† She steps out and begins drying off her back.¬† I turn around.¬† I don‚Äôt want Cindy to get the wrong idea.¬†¬† She hesitates.¬† I can almost hear some apprehension.¬† ‚ÄúSo, how did it go with Ricardo, the stud muffin?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGreat.¬† Going on a date next Thursday night.¬† Now it is my turn, would it be okay if he spent time here as well?¬† You have a much bigger stake here.‚Äù

She finishes drying and puts on a shirt.¬† She walks past me shaking her hips as she goes.¬† I realize she didn‚Äôt bother with underwear.¬† The tart.¬† Love her.¬† Poor Cindy.¬† She seems tough but damn if Jackie isn‚Äôt going to tease the fuck out of her daily.¬† ‚ÄúI think that will be okay.¬† As long as he isn‚Äôt asking for threesomes first, cuz then he hits creep level, and I am not going there.‚Äù¬†

Cindy has been able to hear us since the shower turned off, I bet.¬† She pipes up.¬† ‚ÄúWhat if I asked?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs different, you are adorable and it might be an awakening for Pat.‚Äù¬† She giggles, walks up to the couch, bends over and kisses Cindy.¬† *YOU ARE GIVING ME A SHOW, WENCH!*

She looks back at me and winks.¬† *Bitch!!!¬† You did it on purpose!*

‚ÄúI am still straight sorry.¬† Although you are both absolutely stunning.¬† So it isn‚Äôt that, just not my thing.¬† Also, probably kind of a one-person gal.‚Äù¬† She smiles at that.¬†

‚ÄúNo course deviations, captain. They are approaching the Imperial border,‚Äù came the intelligence officer‚Äôs reply.

‚ÄúDo we know who they are?‚Äù asked the captain.

‚ÄúNegative, sir. Their transponder gives out an unfamiliar signal. Recalibrating sensors for engine emissions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù The idle scratching became a grip of the four-fingered arm.

‚ÄúPositive identification, sir. Terran.‚Äù

‚ÄúTerran? What are they doing on this side of Dhov‚Äôur space?‚Äù

‚ÄúFive planetary cycles ago, the Dhov‚Äôur signed an alliance treaty with them, sir,‚Äù the intelligence officer replied.

‚ÄúSo the Dhov‚Äôur, a warrior race second only to the great Sarthos Empire, enters an alliance with these‚Ä¶ lesser beings after dropping the Quarantine they imposed on the same lessers? Whatever will I hear of next,‚Äù captain remarked casually.

The blue dot on the black screen turned red.

‚ÄúBattle stations. Let‚Äôs take them in. I want this clean and fast.‚Äù

The black vessel with red Sarthos insignia closed the distance between them and their prey in seconds. A much smaller, stocky vessel painted grey, with blue insignia appeared on the viewscreen.

‚ÄúUnidentified Terran warship. This is the Sarthos vessel *Sagadeesh*. Captain Rivthaal Khor-Xar‚Äôvann speaking. You have commited an act of war by crossing the Imperial border. Stand down and surrender or face the Empire‚Äôs retribution.‚Äù

Captain‚Äôs claw let go of the comm button as he turned to his first officer.

‚ÄúRaise shields and prepare to fire. For the glory of the Emperor.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. May he ever rule,‚Äù came the First officer‚Äôs reply.

The static crackled as a channel opened. ‚ÄúThis is UES *Griper*. Exploratory vessel of United Earth. Captain Phineas Boyd speaking. We‚Äôre sorry, didn‚Äôt realize we were in your space. We‚Äôll peacefully retreat. But you gotta mark your border somehow.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they take us for fools?‚Äù Captain opened the channel again. ‚ÄúStandby for boarding and surrender your vessel at once.‚Äù

First officer chimed in. ‚ÄúSir, they are powering down.‚Äù

Captain arched his brow and chuckled. ‚ÄúWell, this is unexpected. No resistance whatsoever. Allies to the Dhov‚Äôur, ha! Prepare a boarding party.‚Äù

First officer clicked his mandibles. ‚ÄúRight away, sir. For the glory of the Emperor.‚Äù

‚ÄúMay he ever rule,‚Äù sighed the captain.

Captain Phineas Boyd watched on the main viewport as the shuttle closed in on the ship, then made a shipwide announcement. ‚ÄúTo all hands, we will come peacefully. Their malfunctioning buoy is an obvious flaw, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll interrogate us, but will release us after they see their mistake. I repeat, we will come peacefully. Offer no resistance.‚Äù

He turned to his first officer, Mevolia Rukh, a Dhov‚Äôur. ‚ÄúWhat do you make of this situation?‚Äù

The feathers on Mevolia‚Äôs head bristled. ‚ÄúSir, the Sarthos are relentless and devious. We should have at least tried to outrun them, as per my previous suggestion. They see everybody as a threat.‚Äù

The boarding party worked efficiently and quickly. In a matter of minutes, all ten of the crew were shackled, the *Griper* caught in a tow ray, and crew transported to the *Sagadeesh*. They found themselves in front of Captain Khor-Xar‚Äôvann.

‚ÄúCaptain, this is all a big misunderstanding. After you contacted us, we detected a buoy marker of your border, silent and adrift‚Ä¶‚Äù started Phineas.

‚ÄúSilence. I do not care for your reasons. You have breached Imperial borders, and by our law, are now prisoners-of-war. You will be escorted to the nearest detention facility. Compliance is mandatory. Repercussions for not complying are grave,‚Äù said the captain.

‚ÄúOh, I have instructed my crew to comply. But I‚Äôm sure if you just run a diagnostic‚Ä¶‚Äù said Phineas.

‚ÄúTake them to the brig,‚Äù said Captain Rivthaal Khor-Xar‚Äôvann. ‚ÄúFor the glory of the Emperor.‚Äù

The boarding party shoved them to start moving, and replied, ‚ÄúMay he ever rule.‚Äù

As they were being escorted to the brig, Mevolia leaned forward to Phineas, whispering softly: ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have surrendered.‚Äù

Phineas smiled faintly, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know you cared.‚Äù

Pharad Mane, the Dhov‚Äôur Ambassador to Earth had a habit of straightening his feathers every time he needed to enter a room. Knocking on the door to the office of David McGuiness, the Earth-Dhov‚Äôur liaison was no different. His feathers losing their vivid green color to a paler one were marks of his age, and a glorious diplomatic career.

‚ÄúCome,‚Äù came the voice from behind the door.

As Pharad entered, David McGuiness stood up from his chair with a smile. ‚ÄúPharad, my old friend, what good news do you bring?‚Äù They shook hands, and David pointed to an empty chair in front of his mahogany desk.

Pharad sat down and nodded. ‚ÄúI have some news of importance. Our‚Ä¶‚Äù

David sat down and lifted his hand as motion of pause, a motion Pharad knew well from his previous interactions with the man. He lifted his phone and called a number, smiling at the Dhov‚Äôur still. ‚ÄúDebbie, please make me a coffee and some herbal tea for our distinguished guest.‚Äù

Putting down his phone, he turned to Pharad. ‚ÄúSo, do we have news of our relief efforts for the Dhov‚Äôur hit by the earthquake?‚Äù

Pharad replied, ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre getting reports that human aid vessels arrived and are on the scene. I wanted to thank you for helping us.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôll always help our allies any way we can, you know that, Pharad.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill, it is appreciated.‚Äù

Debbie entered, carrying the coffee and tea on a small silver platter. ‚ÄúGentlemen.‚Äù

Right at that moment, Pharad‚Äôs comm device chimed. Looking at it, he excused himself. ‚ÄúDavid, Debbie, please, I must apologise, but this might be urgent.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù David arched his eyebrows as Pharad stepped out of the office. He had never seen the old Dhov‚Äôur answering his comm in a formal meeting. This must have been of great importance.

Pharad returned, the feathers on his head bristling. ‚ÄúDavid, I just got some grave news.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù David‚Äôs brow furrowed.

‚ÄúI just got a call from Dazhorak Wrosh'paal Zikthar-Ra, a Sarthos member of their opposition party. He told me that our joint-operation exploration vessel, the *Griper*, violated Sarthos space.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs an honest mistake,‚Äù replied David.

‚ÄúYou and I might see it that way, but the Sarthos do not. They take these kinds of trespasses very seriously. The ship and entire crew are being detained as prisoners of war.‚Äù

David slumped in his chair, eyes widened. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh indeed. Dazhorak and I have worked previously while still young in the diplomacy game. While he may not agree with the doctrine of the Empire, and advocates for more transparency, he knows that this is a serious breach. We might never see any of them again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think they might kill them?‚Äù David asked, concerned.

‚ÄúNot exactly. Prisoners of war are not necessarily executed. They are held for ransom. They could be held indefinitely,‚Äù Pharad somberly said.

David leaned forward, his eyes fixed on Pharad, ‚ÄúThen we need to get to work. Let‚Äôs see how the Sarthos Empire handles the human art of the deal.‚Äù",25,1744374747.0,HFY,2,0.96,False

Vamos precisar de primeiramente definir algumas coisas, nomeadamente:

1. Quantidade de caf√© total por pacote (para ser econ√≥micamente vi√°vel, pelo menos 500g, diria m√°ximo 1kg)
2. Quantidade cada caf√© (diria m√≠nimo 50g, e m√°ximo talvez 100g se a ideia √© experimentar v√°rios diferentes)
3. Budget de cada um (pre√ßo/kg incluindo caixas, sacos, entrega, etc)

Pelo post anterior pareceu me que a generalidade de pessoal prefere torras para espresso (se n√£o for o caso opinem).

O pr√≥ximo passo ser√° mediante o budget escolher o primeiro torrador.

Talvez para discutir mais fluidamente a ideia, e ver quem realmente est√° interessado, criei um grupo de whatsapp para quem estiver interessado em discutir os moldes deste coffee club e mais tarde opinar sobre cada caf√©.

I was called lazy growing up, and I believed it for the longest time. But it wasn‚Äôt laziness‚Äîit was how hard it was for me to transition between tasks. Even the smallest things, like brushing my teeth or washing my hands, can feel like monumental efforts. At work, starting a task without getting distracted feels like an Olympic sport. Cleaning the house? I‚Äôll start one thing, then see something else that needs to be done, and then another, and then another‚Äîand suddenly nothing‚Äôs actually finished.

I forget things constantly and always end up having to go back into the house for something I left. I compulsively touch my dog‚Äôs nose because the texture is comforting. I love reading, but I get distracted so easily. I‚Äôll read the same paragraph over and over because my brain is somewhere else. And texting? I‚Äôll read a message, fully intend to respond, and then somehow‚Ä¶ never do.

Time blindness is real‚ÄîI‚Äôm either way too early or super late, never in between. I start hobbies, get super excited, do them once, and never return‚Ä¶ while telling myself every day that I will. And coffee? It doesn‚Äôt hype me up. It actually calms me down.

Also, I never played video games growing up‚Äîjust never got into them. But recently I started playing, and they‚Äôve actually helped me focus. It‚Äôs one of the few things where my brain locks in and isn‚Äôt all over the place. It‚Äôs been kind of eye-opening.

Looking back, it all makes sense now. And I just got diagnosed a couple months ago, and never knew that it‚Äôs ADHD.

1jwomfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hobonichi/comments/1jwomfh/this_is_so_ridiculous_the_curse_of_the_green/,this is so ridiculous - the curse of the green Weeks [TW for mental illness],"I'm experiencing absolute in(s)anity about the *colour* of a gods-damned *planner* and I just needed to get this off my chest somewhere people might maybe (?) understand\* if nothing else. I generally try not to do vent posts, but I would *really* appreciate an outside perspective or two here, so I hope I can be forgiven for bringing my stupid planner angst (and badly censored expletives) into this usually chill sub.

The problem? My Sneaker Weeks Mega is purple. 

My brain apparently *needs* it to be green. The purple Weeks is illegal and icky and bad, *apparently*. It is somehow an offence to every neuron in my whack-a\*\* brain. 

Let the record state: I like purple. I am in fact wearing purple trousers *right now* with zero issues. And when I first saw the two Sneaker colours for 2025 I liked them *both*, if the green *a little* more. (Emphasis on ""a *little*"".) So when I saw a unused purple Sneaker Weeks for a good price secondhand, I bought it and was happy that I had saved some money on my 2025 planner.

...Until I went to use it. Every time I've used this f\*cking cursed purple planner (and I haven't used it more than five or six times this year yet - mostly for ""life has been A Lot/my AuDHD being mean to me"" reasons, but damn it the colour thing has NOT helped), my brain has insisted that it wants the green version. Every. Motherhugging. Time.

Every time I go to pick up the planner, my brain reminds me that it's not the green one. And my brain wants the green one! The purple one is not acceptable! At all! Ever!   
Every time I think about how I should really get back into a regular planning/tracking habit so as not to give my disabilities completely free reign over my life, my brain reminds me that this planner *won't* be acceptable for that, because it is the wrong colour, so ewwwww, brain doesn't even want to touch it. 

Every time I even so much as *glance* at this (purple! which is a colour I *like*!) planner, the emotion-controlling part of my brain throws a mini-tantrum of disappointed sadness verging on disgust that the planner is not green. Heavens forbid I see a picture of the green version somewhere. My brain immediately gets ready to trade gold, jewels and goat herds I don't have for it. 

The real kicker? I have put the Purple Affront To My Stupid Brain inside a (gorgeous, might I add) green leather cover. 

*My planner is now green on the outside. Green! G-R-E-E-N. GReeEEEeeeNnnn!*

Did this help? You bet your sweet innocent soul it did...ABSOLUTELY NOT help even a little bit. Because my brain still knows that the planner is purple under the green leather. Which is *apparently* an icky, illegal and irredeemably horrid colour on this. One. Single. Item. In my life. Specifically. 

Yes, this makes my brain sound like a particularly spoiled petulant five-year-old. Unfortunately that five-year-old is holding my planning system hostage. 

Embarrassing as that is to admit; I nearly cried when I woke up from a nap at one point, because I had had a *dream* (if you can believe it) that I had gotten the green Sneaker Weeks instead and had been using it consistently. \[The consistency thing is utter fantasy of course, there was nothing wrong with my A6 until it got fatally wounded by a coffee spill (big oof) and I didn't use that consistently or really at all this year either.\] 

Jesus wept. I'm cry-laughing typing this. My head hurts. I want to stuff my brain into the washing machine and give it seven spin cycles and a bleach cleanse. 

I have a green Sneaker Weeks Mega sitting in my Amazon cart right now, taunting me with next-day delivery. A little purple-planner-hating devil on my shoulder is whispering at me that I need a non-coffeed A6 Techo anyway, so wouldn't it just be a waste if I got the green Weeks in a separate package later. Think of the environment! The environment. While I am ordering non-essential items *from Amazon*. Yeah, right... Sure. Whatever you say, brain. So rational and calculated.

I consider myself pretty far into my OCD recovery at this point (and am also well aware that even healthy, non-OCD autistic brains are unfortunately *very* good at getting quasi-obsessively stuck on things), but I'm genuinely starting to wonder if this ""curse"" of the purple Weeks is a sign that I need to ramp up the therapy again.   
  
Or maybe I'm dramatising and just need to chill and buy the f\*cking green planner? Maybe? Is this really a hill I should ~~die~~ kill my planner system that's been supporting me well on? Is it more or less insane to treat this as a Serious Issue (TM) than to just make a single effing Amazon order?

Maybe wasting 32‚Ç¨ and making some very expensive scrap paper out of the Purple Menace *is* a price I should be willing to pay for a return to (planner) sanity? (It's cheaper than therapy sessions...) Am I just choosing the bad/worse ~~timeline~~ path because I'm stubborn and don't want my OCD (or whatever the reason for the Purple Curse is) to win?

Hell if I bl\*\*dy know at this point! But hey, what do you all think? Seriously, please tell me what you would do in the comments below. Or send ~~help~~ words of encouragement. I just want to use my planner and am beyond fed up with my brain's obsessive nonsense. I hate this. I just want to go ~~home~~ plan my weekend.

Bless you if you have read this far. Thank you to coming to my ~~TED talk~~ cringe-worthy mental crisis. May all your planners always be exactly the right colour(s).

\[\* Understand intellectually, I hope. If you understand in the sense that you emotionally relate to this experience in any way ...well, my condolences. Broken brain high-five?\]",9,1744374450.0,hobonichi,15,0.72,False

I read lots of comments that it tastes too bitter or even tastes like battery acid. But I think I'm down for bitter things because I also like dark chocolate and bitter coffee. I like the smoky and bitter taste of Taragui.

And today I got my new yerba mate which is yellow Canarias. At the first it smells so much like green tea which I don't like. But later on I started to like it because I got sourish aftertaste.

My question is that what yerba mates brand do you recommend me similar to Taragui. I also like the sour taste, do you know any other yerba mates also taste similar?",2,1744374444.0,yerbamate,1,1.0,False

A little sharing of the day, between two coffees and three renderings: I made an interesting little calculation 

If you want to be an independent architect completely legally (and with professional software), here is what it looks like per month:

AutoCAD (plans): ‚Ç¨394

Adobe Suite (editing + layout): ‚Ç¨67

3DS Max (3D): ‚Ç¨288

...I'll let you do the annual calculation, there are too many zeros for me. (‚Ç¨9000 per year üòÅ)

Fortunately, I found some solutions:
For 3D: Blender To replace Adobe: Affinity (incidentally, share this software in schools and for independent hyper-powerful European software)

But I'm still stuck on the plan/CAD part.
Do you have affordable alternatives, open source or with lifetime licenses, to replace AutoCAD?

Otherwise, let‚Äôs say that a little ‚Äúoff the record‚Äù boost for a version of AutoCAD on Windows 10 or Mac M1 for personal use would also be welcome‚Ä¶ you get the idea? If someone could share the info with me üòÅ

Thank you in advance to those who have tips, good tips or feedback to share!

**What is Print Advertising?**

Print advertising refers to marketing campaigns or promotional messages delivered through printed media such as newspapers, magazines, brochures, flyers, or direct mail. Unlike digital advertising, print ads engage audiences through tangible, physical mediums that they can touch and interact with.

# Key Characteristics of Print Advertising:

* **Tangible Media**: Ads appear on actual paper, offering readers a tactile experience.
* **Target Audience**: Good print ads resonate strongly with niche audiences, often tailored by publication. For example, a luxury watch ad in a high-end lifestyle magazine.
* **Visual Design Focus**: Creativity is key. Strong imagery and impactful layouts are important to attract attention quickly.
* **Durability and Longevity**: Printed ads often have lasting power, sitting on coffee tables or shelves for weeks, months, or even years.

Print advertising remains highly relevant in industries where trust, brand value, and storytelling are critical. Even as digital media grows, print continues to solidify its place in campaigns for books, luxury products, local services, and more.

I have what you can call an addictive personality (did the substances and got sober, been through MULTIPLE different habit-addictions over the years) and my current vice is SUDOKU. What????

Obviously if this is my biggest worry right now then I have a damn good life but its lowkey getting in the way of me being a person. I‚Äôve been consistently playing for 7 years but the last month has been nonstop grid grid grid grid grid. I play in class, during breaks, during rests between workouts, on the toilet. If I‚Äôm able to be on my phone, I‚Äôm doing a sudoku. Its slowly crept into staying up a little later to play more, then muscle memory hitting ‚Äúplay new‚Äù without thought, then accidental all-nighters, and now I‚Äôve been intentionally drinking coffee at night just to play grid after grid after grid. Ive completely acclimated to the algorithms of 3 different apps and have to switch when the hardest levels get too easy. I play with no tips hints or highlights and ive begun not using notes/candidates just to stimulate myself. The past 2 weeks Ive been averaging 4+ hours of screen time A DAY on these god forsaken apps and then I also have a physical book of 10k grids. I see grids when I close my eyes. I create and solve them in my dreams. Am I going crazy?

I dont know if this is a common sudoku-er problem or if I need to see a professional. Maybe its a phone addiction? Its gotten significantly worse after deleting tiktok/insta/etc. At least its a good habit? ",8,1744374254.0,sudoku,7,1.0,False

Is this normal for INTPs relarionships?,"So I (INFJ female) had a coworker, (INTP male), a few years ago. He was the typical computer scientist, nerdy INTP type. We developed a friendship due to our shared sense of humor and supporting each other. I liked him, cared for him, and thought he did too. He was a great person, and I found him interesting‚Äîhis quirks were quite cute. After I left the company, we talked a few times, and we met up for coffee and conversation. Given his nerdy and socially awkward persona, I thought that must mean he cared for me. I thought we were friends.

Then came a time of silence that lasted for months. I contacted him a few times‚Äîhe was very nice, but he never initiated contact. I started to feel that our relationship was asymmetrical and that he wasn‚Äôt really interested in me. During this time, I went through a very delicate and aggressive brain surgery. I reached out to tell him about my condition, and I honestly told him, ‚ÄúListen, I didn‚Äôt know if I should be telling you this, because I don‚Äôt know if you care or if we‚Äôre really friends, but just in case‚Ä¶‚Äù He assured me he cared and was thankful to know, and I think he was honest‚Äîhe never seemed like a dishonest person to me.

We started talking again. A few months after my surgery, his father fell ill and died in a pretty dramatic way. I tried to be there for him. I talked to him and let him vent. I thought that meant some sort of bonding.

As I had been recovering for a while and was able to walk and do some things again, he proposed going to a restaurant and having a nice time. I thought this was very kind of him. I don‚Äôt think he knew, but he was the first person I decided to see during my recovery. I was still in bad physical condition, and he knew‚ÄîI had lost hearing on the left side, had facial paralysis, and my left eye was damaged. He knew all of this. Yet the lunch turned out to be quite awkward and painful for me. He was almost half an hour late, and when he arrived, he seemed completely in shock at my condition. I tried to mention everything, to shake off the taboo and laugh about it a little, but it didn‚Äôt work. He looked stiff and uncomfortable. When the waiter came from my blind and deaf side, he just sat there, watching me struggle, without offering any help. I felt heartbroken. And although I tried to understand that it might have been hard for him, some of his behavior didn‚Äôt sit well with me at all.

I didn‚Äôt contact him anymore, and unsurprisingly, he never reached out either. It was sad, though. I feel like he never really cared for me, and maybe I‚Äôd been pushing a friendship that was unwanted. But there‚Äôs a lot of incoherence in his behavior too.

I really don‚Äôt understand what happened. He was a pretty immature and turbulent INTP. But I cared for him.

The longer I listened, the more certain I became that it wasn't a horn.



It sounded like a million voices, humming in perfect unison. Low and steady. Vibrating through the ground, through my body.



The tent rattled violently as another gust slammed into it‚Äîand then my worst fear became a reality.¬†



A guy line snapped. I flinched.



Another one followed, a harsh twang lost in the wind.



I couldn‚Äôt ignore it. I had to get outside. Had to fix it before the tent collapsed completely.



With trembling hands, I grabbed my coat, shoved on my boots, and crawled out into the storm.



The rain hit like needles. Wind roared around me, threatening to tear me from the mountainside. Lightning split the sky above the ridge‚Äîand for a moment, I saw movement behind the tent.¬†



Something other than wind. Other than rain.¬†



I turned.¬†



The symbols. They were wrong.¬†



Not just clearer, not just brighter‚Äîwrong.¬†



Rewritten.



Lines that used to fade into the stone were now jagged and sharp. Fresh.¬†



They twisted in ways I couldn't follow‚Äîas if spelling something out. As if they were watching back.¬†



Another flash of lightning‚Äîthis time closer.¬†



The hum grew louder¬è.



Whatever this was‚Äîit wasn't just a weather system.¬†



The guy lines were beyond saving, and I needed to get away from the tent. It was no longer a sanctuary‚Äîjust a flapping sheet of fabric waiting to entangle or suffocate me.¬†



I left everything inside. Took only what I had on me‚Äîmy bag, my jacket and my boots‚Äîand started moving back down the ridge.¬†



This was dangerous but not as dangerous as staying here.¬†



If I wanted to survive this, I had to keep moving.¬†



I moved as slowly and carefully as I could, my boots slipping on the rocks regardless.¬†



I kept my mind locked on the path‚Äîon each step‚Äîbut the humming grew louder with every footfall.



Then, without warning, the hum had exploded into an ear-splitting yowl, and the wind that had only threatened to throw me from the mountain finally did.¬†



I was yanked off my feet like a ragdoll, tossed through the air‚Äîthen slammed into the rocks below with the force of a car crash.¬†



I had never been in this much pain. It felt like my consciousness hovered above‚Äîmy body battered and broken below. I was sure this was it. This was the end.¬†



At least in death, I‚Äôd be with Eilidh.¬†



I came to‚Äîjust for a moment. A familiar voice was telling me everything would be okay‚Äîthat I‚Äôd been found, that I was in the hospital.



Then I passed out again.¬†



I woke up in the hospital, surrounded by beeping machines. There was someone in the room next to me, but I couldn‚Äôt move my head to check who it was.¬†



I could hardly move at all. A groan escaped my throat as I tried to shift‚Äîjust enough to get a better look.



The sound must‚Äôve woken them.



The woman uncurled from her sleeping position in the chair, blinked her eyes open, and looked at me smiling.



‚ÄúBet ye wish ye‚Äôd waited fur me noo,‚Äù she said softly, laughing gently.¬†



It was Eilidh.¬†



My head spun and my hand shot out to¬†grip the bed rail.¬†



I didn‚Äôt speak. I couldn't.



My mind wouldn‚Äôt accept what I was seeing. I just stared at her‚Äîat Eilidh. Alive. Smiling. Laughing. Looking at me with that same gentle stare.¬†



I felt the pull of the IV in my arm. Heard the machines. Smelled the sharp sting of disinfectant.¬†



But none of it made sense. Not with Eilidh sitting beside me.¬†



*Did I die?*¬†



*Is this heaven?*¬†



*Is it hell?*¬†



Eilidh didn‚Äôt notice my silence.



She kept talking‚Äîsaid they‚Äôd found me halfway up the mountain. That *she* had called mountain rescue when my Garmin had stopped sending out signals.¬†



I blinked hard. My Garmin? That was‚Ä¶ right. I think.¬†



But she was here. Talking like it had been her watching me go, her waiting for updates, her calling for help.¬†



Not the other way around.¬†



She poured a glass of water and pressed it to my lips. Water dribbled down my chin and soaked into the sheets.¬†



Eilidh just smiled and set the glass down on the table beside me. ‚ÄúYou gave us aw a right fright. Thought ye wurny coming back, ye shouldny huv gone yersel.‚Äù



I stared at her.



This wasn‚Äôt how it happened.¬†



I had stayed home.¬†



She had gone.¬†



She had never come back.¬†



But here she was. And none of this was right.¬†



Something was wrong.¬†



The door opened and two nurses stepped in, followed by a doctor holding a clipboard.¬†



Eilidh stood and stretched slightly.



‚ÄúAh‚Äôll get oot yer road, been choking for a coffee anyway‚Äù she said before giving me a wink and slipping out the door.



I wanted to call her back, ask her what the hell was going on‚Äîbut my throat was still raw, and my brain felt like it was still up there on the mountain.¬†



The doctor glanced at my chart, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a long recovery ahead of you. How are you feeling?‚Äù



I croaked, ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ where am I?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre at the Royal Infirmary. You were found alone near the summit two days ago. Severe exposure, concussion, a few cracked ribs. You‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù



I blinked, ‚ÄúWho found me?‚Äù



The doctor hesitated. ‚ÄúMountain rescue. Your friend, Eilidh, called them. She saved your life.‚Äù

¬†

I stared at him.¬†



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not listed as one of your emergency contacts,‚Äù he added, almost to himself. ‚ÄúBut since she made the call, we thought it best to let her stay. Familiar faces can be grounding‚Äîespecially after significant trauma.‚Äù



I swallowed. ‚ÄúWhat about my parents? Do they know I‚Äôm here?‚Äù¬†



A flicker of concern passed over his face. ‚ÄúWith a concussion like yours, a little confusion is normal. Let‚Äôs focus on your recovery for now. We can talk more later, once you‚Äôve rested.‚Äù¬†



That set off alarm bells in my head.¬†



*Wit did he mean confusion? A remember everything just fine.*¬†



But before I could press him, the nurses were already gone‚Äîand the doctor followed close behind, leaving me alone with a ringing in my ears and Eilidh‚Äôs voice still echoing in my mind.¬†



The more I thought about her, the more something felt off. I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it‚Äîuntil she came back into the room.¬†



Eilidh's eyes were the wrong colour. ",9,1744373958.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

I just recently read Before the Coffee Gets Cold and am currently halfway through The Full Moon Coffee Shop.

I enjoyed reading both of them, but I'm looking specifically for something like Minjun's story in Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop.

I loved reading about how he learned and discovered things about coffee along the way, and how it kinda has an impact on his life or how he views things.

But anything coffee-related is welcome! Thank you so much!",13,1744373620.0,PHBookClub,0,0.89,False

I work remotely (and I'm single/divorced and empty-nested) so I have the freedom to move about. 

I‚Äôm easy-going, intellectually curious and creative. I have a good career in tech, but my interests run wide. Art, psychology, language, design.  I enjoy long walks, good coffee and beautiful views.

1jwocoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1jwocoa/rto_help/,RTO Help,"Hi all,

I just took a new job that requires me to be in the office 5 days, at least for the first several months to a year. For me this means commute by bus, and a 10 minute walk on either side of it, both ways.

I live in Pittsburgh PA which means it could be raining, snowing etc, and often times that means I have an umbrella, change of shoes for wet commutes and also a puffer jacket for very cold days (we are still in this territory now).

Currently I carry: 

..Calpak Kaya backpack (laptop, mouse, cord, notebook, and shoe change if I need it, packed lunch Tupperware.. shoes go in leather bag if I have a lunch)

..Portland Leather Mini Crossbody Tote (pocketbook, phone, earbuds, bus pass, building Id, sunglasses, women items)

..some days I use the building gym and will bring a 3rd bag (literally the bag Lulu gives you when you buy something) with my gym sneakers, leggings and a top in it.  

..most days I carry a coffee Yeti in my hand


I feel a little like a pack mule on all of these days, but especially on gym days because I will have taken off work clothes to use the gym (remain in gym clothes for the ride home) and am trying to stuff a whole work outfit (this time of year could be bulky sweater) into all 3 of these bags, while trying to avoid my stuff falling all over the place on the bus while I'm digging for a bus pass.

I don't love the idea of putting quick grab items in the backpack because it feels cumbersome to have to take the bag on and off to get out the bus pass or phone or ID, especially in a puffy coat where it is not a smooth operation to do so. It makes me feel like I do need a second bag, but what?? Larger? Smaller? 

Also I would like this bag solution to be flexible enough to work with a professional work outfit but also something I can carry on the weekends. This is why I have historically gone brown leather.

Right now I love the look of the Madewell woven tote (or quince version for le$$) and wondering if something like that could be the new gym day bag plus the Caya, with my quick items in a dressier belt bag that goes inside the tote on those days, but is just worn as a crossbody on non tote days to avoid having to change items in different bags daily. (Recipe for left behind essentials) BUT this is kind of still 3 bags. Ugh!

Thanks for any advice or suggestions!!

1jwocjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jwocjn/any_downside_to_larger_drippers/,Any downside to larger drippers?,"Hi caffeinated friends,

I tragically broke my beloved Hario 02 glass dripper the other day and need to buy a replacement. 

I often make coffee for two, and like larger cups of coffee, so I end up pretty much maxing out what the 02 can handle, which in my experience, is around ~65g of grounds. (I usually brew ~1:10-1:12 so that nets roughly 650mL of coffee.)

Usually I can keep that contained, but on rare occasions, I do experience a little overflow. So I‚Äôm thinking about upsizing to an 03. 

Thing is, I do sometimes just make one cup, and the 02 already felt too big for that. I get all in my head about wasting paper, and it‚Äôs also tougher to dodge hitting paper when there‚Äôs so much more of it and the coffee is kinda crammed in the bottom of the bigger cone. 

So am I doomed to just buy an 01 and an 03 and have two sizes of filters forever? Any downsides to larger drippers in general I don‚Äôt know about? Should I just buy a Kalita for my tiny one cause they‚Äôre so darn cute and I might buy two anyway? 

Thanks!
