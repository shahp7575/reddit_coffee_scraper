This contracting company was **losing tons of business** because no one was answering the phone. The owner ran **two different operations**, and only had **one guy** answering calls for both. He was missing calls left and right — potential clients were literally calling competitors instead.

So I built them a **voice AI agent** that picks up calls instantly, greets customers professionally, answers basic questions, and **books appointments directly into their calendar**.

# The difference was crazy:

* Before: dozens of missed calls a week, lost opportunities, stressed owner.
* After: **0 missed calls**, full control of their schedule, and **15–20% more jobs booked** in the first month.

The owner told me he felt like he “finally hired a reliable employee who never sleeps.”

And the best part?  
That “employee” costs less than a coffee per day. 

If you’ve got a small business (or clients who do) that’s struggling with missed calls, lead follow-ups, or scheduling headaches — **AI voice agents are a total game changer**.

I made $1,000 on this first project alone, and I’m already working on my next one.  
If you’re curious how it works or want to see how to get one set up, **just hit me up** — happy to share the details.",1,1759961342.0,EntrepreneurConnect,0,1.0,False

1o1otx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o1otx1/transparent_desire/,Transparent Desire,"Dear Mr. ""•●•"",

This is a request. ..

Do us both an huge favor. 

Do not visit me with your conflicted heart and shakey resolve. It wastes both our time and then the time spent is strained, confusing, tense or overtly miserable.  

I would rather wait longer to see you if it means you bring your full self and desire.

Be prepared to ask for what you need and expect i will be eager to meet the need if i am able...

Don't come to me and then start spinning through your mind what ifs and being lost with some other longing. 

I dont want to spend one moment with you , EVER, in which you'd rather be somewhere else. 

You can be grumpy and still have quality time. 

That isnt the problem. 

You seem to be unaware of how clearly your heart speaks and how easily I can hear it when it's conflicted. 

Its unpleasant to host you. And pointless, honestly, if you are going to meet my joy with harsh shut downs when I wish about something I learned or an interedtjng thought. 

When you get antsy and restless you continue to refuse to excuse yourself and rather strum up false fight bait or become a nuisance. 

This is noy necessary.  

The moment your heart pulls aaay i would like you to leave. 

All you have to say is 
""Its greeble hunting time.""

That's all. 

We both part on good terms this way. 


When you visit with a real true desire to be near me [regardless of mood] it is as if you have brought us 2 fresh hit coffees to enjoy with one another. 

When you come to me with your fence sitting unsure heart it is as if you show up with a couple half consumed coffees grown bitter cold and stale. I politely thank you for the thought and then you proceed to drink this coffee, be repulsed by it and grow negative. 

If qe elaborate on this you may then notice im not drinking mine (felt it cold, assumed it was bitter I set it aside)  maybe you lress ""not having any..?"" 
And then feel hurt that you brougt me something ive apparently refused. Offended and rejected likely begins a short temper and harsh words from you. 

So, life is short . I would rather be lonely and wait for your hot coffee visits, where pleasant memories are made than have any other version of you at this time in our dynamic. 


Don't try to ride a horse while facing backwards. 

I prepare myself or inquire within myself if at any particular time i can being my best for an interacrion with you. I dont linger with you when my heart isnt in it to avoid misunderstandings. Returning this favor would be appreciated. 

One more analogy:

It would be uncomfortable if you accepted a friend's invite to dinner , knowing they were excited to prepare a dish to share with you and then arrive having just eaten. 
They would likely feel a bit wounded, the point was to share the enjoyable food and you now lack any desire. 

Maybe you try to smooth it over by forcing a fee nibbles while you have no appetite. 
Your flat responses and clear struggle to eat are apparent. your friend is hurt. 

You says""no no itsbgreat its good ... ""
They can hear your insincerity and feel further confused and wounded. The mood is sour.

Some part of your prearrival meal isn't sitting well with you and now you are physically uncomfortable too. 

Anyone could see how much of a disaster this behavior would be.. correct?

Come to me when you are hungry. 
Stay for awhile to digest. 

And when you head back out

Pick a lane......


{For f#cksake already}


 Its good Manners.

Mamba was sipping on his morning coffee from his sniper post watching two nakeds run around. A loud sniper shot rang out. “Got one.” Mamba quietly whispered under his breath. Another loud shot rang out. “Second one down.” The Collecter tapped him on the shoulder.

 “Hey Mamba-Chan, what are you doing?” Collecter yelled excitedly. “Babe shut up, I’m trying to snipe and I don’t wanna alert anyone!” Mamba replied. “Oh yeah… sorry!” Collecter said. Mamba had his sights set on the head of a kitted player. Right as he was about to take the shot, multiple loud, unsupressed shots rang out. “Got him!” Said Collecter. “GOD FUCKING DAMNIT BABE I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM!” yelled Mamba.

Collecter frowned, not intending to make him upset. “I-I’m sorry Mamba-Chan… I just wanted to help…” Mamba sighed before shooing him off with a singular hand motion. “Just let me handle sniping, okay baby?” Collector happily nodded before skedadling off. Their outpost was in the abandoned mansion overlooking the huts. Collector happily skipped into the living room, plopping down onto the couch before taking out his phone. He opened it and saw that Nikolai-Chan had texted him. “Hey, need help ASAP! Tatra giving mixed signals!” Collector giggles to himself before texting back. “Okay! I gotchu girl!”

Back In Mall…

 Tatra sat down in the back of food court, taking his armor and helmet off. It had been a long day of killing players and scavs. “Nikolai’s too cute, but I have to keep it professional!” He mumbled to himself, gently wrapping his arm with a bandage. Meanwhile, Nikolai was walking alone the basement, looking for any streamer items. “Hey.” A mysterious voice called out from behind Nikolai, scaring him. “Ahh!! Who’s there?!” He shouted, jumping back to see who was behind him. Collector slowly walked out from the shadows. “I got your text. What’s the situation?” He said, approaching Nikolai.


Nikolai and Collector aimlessly wandered Chodov mall, enjoying their conversation. “So, you like Tatra, but he’s playing hard to get?” Collector curiously asked Nikolai. “Tch, yeah! He always flirts with me, then rejects all of my advances!” He pouted, kicking the ground as he walked. “Okay, hear me out.” Collector said, getting Nikolai’s full attention. “Hmm?” Nikolai, hummed, looking at Collector. “What if we got all the bosses to go on some big military operation? We could get each couple to finally spend time together and we could get Tatra to finally confess to you.” Nikolai smilies brightly, nodding enthusiastically to his idea. “I love it, let’s do that!” He said, cheering as he did so. The plan was set, next was actually committing to it.",1,1759961106.0,GhostsOfTabor,0,1.0,False

1o1orps,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o1orps/golden_fields_section_one_golden_fields/,Golden Fields Section One: Golden Fields?,"The heavy winds of Montana’s Tobacco Root range rolled in across the parries, kicking choking dust up into the air. The coarse sand spilled from the Precambrian rock formations spattered throughout the valley, marking the ancient passage of glaciers from thousands of years earlier.

  
The multistory spires of ancient sun-bleached sandstone stood tall, but when compared to the equally grey mountains beyond the valley’s pine-covered foothills, they might as well have been an insignificant nothingness. Ants standing before eldritch gods.

  
But that form of ancient wonder was not something that held the attention of a lone figure trundling down an old dirt road. Thin scrub grass scratched his pressed pants; their little fingers grabbed and tore loose every thread of wool they could. 

  
The dry silt dust clung to every nook and cranny of his once pristine leather dress shoes, as small rocks were crushed beneath each footfall; every plodding step adding to the never-ending dust.

  
An ancient and unknowable enemy of mankind was taking its toll on him; an invisible beast, but one that assured you paid your cost in mucus, dried eyes, and fits of sneezing— allergies. 

  
He coughed and spat out phlegm again before wiping his brow with the white button-down sleeve of his shirt, leaving the material stained with wet dust and ruining the shirt. Typically, he would have been upset about his shirt being soiled, but after wearing the same clothes for a week straight without a chance to wash them, all he had left to wear was already destroyed.

  
“Can you shut the fuck up!?” Luke yelled up at the sky moments after an agricultural drone buzzed overhead; its whirring repulsion engines grating on his last nerve.

  
Never in his life had he believed that everything he had planned for years could fall apart in a matter of seconds. But somehow it happened to him. A soon-to-be fiancé...gone. All of his so-called friends...abandoned him. Even his own mother thought he was some monster in human skin after the lies she had propagated.

  
Initially, when Luke saw Jackie in their room with ----, he would rather not think about what he had seen or what she had done. Recounting what happened before he ran from his old life still hurt like glass shards being driven into his brain. It still made him dry heave and gag a week post-revelation of how fake their love had been.

  
Luke had assumed his flight from Olympus Mons University and silence about what happened would not have meant much beyond having to alert a few people of where he was going, but the effects were far beyond that. 

  
Now, he was in essence all alone within the vast universe.

  
His doctorate was in question because the dean of the agricultural department bought that liar's story without question and revoked his scholarships, placing him on probation due to integrity violations. 

  
That they had been working together for nearly a decade meant nothing to Professor Swate when Jackie put on the waterworks and twisted her betrayal into illicit accusations against his morality.

  
The only person back at Olympus Mons University who supported Luke was Doctor Harold Dimula, Luke’s longtime genetics and applied agricultural growth teacher. His support was undoubtedly what kept Luke from indulging in a sinful meal of alkaloid botany.

  
Dimula, bless him, gave Luke a less-than-lethal path to escape the situation. He felt pity after seeing how far the once bright-eyed and eager graduate student had fallen to alcohol and self-loathing.

  
That non-fatal solution to his problems was not some proof to clear his name of assault, nor would it set the world right, but it did offer him sanctuary. All it would cost Luke was his presence, expertise in 24th-century farming and agriculture, and the willingness to do whatever the owner expected to ensure the ranch's success.

  
The ranch had been scraping by for years and had been in desperate need of assistance. Luke asked why they had never hired people when problems began to occur, but Dimula never gave Luke an answer that made sense. Something about his answer still seemed wrong, like he was not telling Luke the entire story.

  
“Well, Kurkel is a stubborn man, and he probably did not feel spending what little money they had would fix the issues,” Dimula had explained. “He is a real, pull yourself up by the bootstraps kind of man. You know the type.”

  
Luke indeed knew the type and expected this ranch to be troubled by the same issue he had seen many times while earning his master's degree, and his now never-to-be doctorate. The farmer was stubborn, stuck in their ways, and did not wish to adapt to modern tools and techniques, resulting in them falling behind in production. A sinful thing that the coalition of planets had sent more failures to an *applicable skills camp* for.

  
Stubborn old farmers were a tale as old as time. Luke just hoped this time would be a different case; he had fruitlessly battled enough old timers when it came to fixing their fields and plants, doing so again was not an appealing idea.

  
Luke especially hoped so because if the farmer were lugged off to a *skill camp,* it would cost him the three hots and a cot, something he was in desperate need of here on earth. He knew no one. Dimula’s friend was Luke's only connection to his species' cradle world; if this did not pan out, Luke had no idea where he would go.

   
Luke looked down at his Data slate and groaned. There were still another four hours of walking to reach the entrance to his friend Kurkel’s ranch, “Golden Fields.”

  
If that lazy driver had taken him all the way to the ranch, Luke would have been there hours ago and hopefully already burying himself within whatever work the ranch needed. But apparently, going the last few miles down the road into the old dusty town of Grey Rock and hanging a left onto the only road leading to Golden fields was unfeasible.

  
The man complained that the dirt and rocks would scratch his car. That was nothing but an excuse to take the money and run, leaving the rider high and dry. In fact, such a scam was a standard issue across coalition space, because payment had to be given upfront for services, it was in the cabbie's best interest to cut and run. They already had their money after all.

   
With no other choice on how to reach his destination, Luke soldiered on, marching through the Montana early spring heat without faltering.

  
Despite his sour mood, Luke had to appreciate the beauty of this place. Endless rolling fields touched the mountain foothills. Farms of varying types could be seen just as far. The only thing breaking up the infinite continuity was the babbling of brooks or the distant sound of service roads.

  
Cattle grazed beneath the shade offered by the gargantuan solar kites cabled almost half a mile in the air.

  
The shadows cast by those monumental creations of industry were like stationary clouds, always offering one reprieve from the heat and scalding radiation Sol emitted.

  
Not only did the local fauna find them as a place to seek shelter, as Luke crested a small hillock and the town of Grey Rock came into view, a group of local teenagers waved at him from beneath one of the kites while they lounged in a small brook.

   
He returned the gesture and momentarily considered hopping the fence to grab a drink after one of the scantily clad girls offered him a beer. But he decided against it, shouting “Thanks but no thanks” in a crackly dry voice.

  
By the time he was almost to the town’s outskirts, a new sound grew into the orchestra of nature’s bounty. A dull, thrumming noise arose and eventually overtook the bleating of goats, the mooing of cattle, and the whistling wind through the solar kite cables.

  
It was the sound of a vehicle, an old combustion engine, and tires on dirt. Luke had never heard one in person before. They were not used on Mars at all, and even here on Earth, they were considered archaic and only used in heavy-duty industries where the torque they allow was needed, or in places like this town.

  
Towns where Earth forgot, and they preferred it that way. A small town, full of people happy with small, uneventful lives.

  
“Well, hello there, lad. Where you heading?” a male voice said loudly, overpowering the sounds of the engine as the truck pulled up from behind Luke and stopped.

  
The man looked old and well-worn, with wrinkled, tan skin, grey hair, and a set of overalls that were barely held together by rough, hand-sewn stitching. 

  
Compared to the man, the vehicle looked young. Hard-bodied steel, spattered with rust, its once-vibrant green paint and the logo on the cab's side were barely discernible. 

  
“Golden Fields,” Luke replied, clearing his brow with his sleeve yet again. “What makes you ask?”

  
“Spotted you a few miles back, right when you walked past my place,” the man replied. He jutted a thumb over his shoulder. “Back at the Johnson place. You walked right by my mailbox. And I figured you looked a little lost, so I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”

  
Luke thought of it for a moment and recalled the house and the lone mailbox. The aforementioned house loomed atop one of the hills, surrounded by miles and miles of barley and rhubarb. The sprouts waved steadily like an ocean between the road and the old prairie-style home. He could even recall this old rambling truck, parked beside it.

  
“Ah, I see,” Luke replied.

  
Luke had to admit he did look quite out of place around here. He was dressed like a lost lawyer, not a farmhand, or a local by any means. That this old man's sharp green eyes spotted the interloper within their midst was not shocking.

  
Every time Luke went to a new farming community, he was quickly assessed as an outsider and treated as such. It was not that the sapients in those places were insular and hated him; they just showed both hesitant caution of out-groups, and wanted to ensure he did not wander into places he had no right to be in.

  
He was lucky enough to never have dealt with the latter issue. But he had heard tales of other contracted agricultural researchers and workers stumbling upon illicit narcotic productions or scandalous affairs.

  
The locals never appreciated them finding what should have been well hidden. As such, the outsider was run out of town, not unlike the tax collectors of the old American colonies nearly five hundred years earlier.

  
So, learning from the follies of his contemporaries and predecessors, Luke took the man up on the offer for a ride, through town and to the destination where he would bury his old life to whither, and ultimately be forgotten.

  
“Hank Johnson,” the man said, extending a well-worn hand toward Luke once the younger human had settled into the seat in the truck.

  
“Luke Stephens,” Luke replied, returning the handshake.

  
“Well, it is nice to meet you, Luke,” Hank said as the truck started to roll.

  
“Same,” Luke nodded.

  
They entered Grey Rock, and Hank began to ramble on about the town. The town itself was nothing special compared to the dozens of others Luke had called home over the years. Slant roofs, solar panels shimmering, with grey duracrete bricks held together with mortar.

   
If you could not check the date on your calendar, it would look no different from a developing town in the twenty-first century.

  
Hand-drawn signs and fading brick shops included. Luke just hoped this town's drunk was more pleasant than the last one. That asshole ended up stealing the catalytic converter from several of his previous clients' tractor-bots. An infraction that had the coalition's jackboots whisk him away in the night.

   
Hank, through his overly excited tales, ensured that the stranger knew everything there was to do within the area. Hank was a font of knowledge: the local grocery store and its hours, the dinner and the confectionery coffee cakes Maria only sold on Sunday mornings, and of course, the farming store; A location Luke would be needing for his job, if his previous bouts with failing agricultural plots were anything to go by.

  
He was already racking numbers in his mind. How many chits would fresh herbicide, fungicide, and the methods to deploy them cost his soon-to-be employer and landlord? He could make wild assumptions, but without the whole picture, putting much effort into such an action was a waste of effort.   


The town had a healthy amount of mixed species, something that was not common on Earth but was very common on Mars.  


They passed by several dozen Farunse shopping for the day. They were tall, lean, and cat-like, covered in thick fur in as many colors and patterns as domestic felines.  


A Varintol woman pushed a cart filled with early growth squash. She, like most of that Ursine-like species’ females, was buxom, towering, and covered with both steel cable-like muscle and insulating fat and fur so thick you could drown in it.  


She spotted Luke watching her from a stoplight and waved, giving him a brimming smile that showed off her several-inch-long fangs. Those shining daggers could give a kodiak bear a wicked case of insecurity issues.  


The only other species they saw was a man that Hank pulled off to the side of the road to speak to.   


“Hey, Brukus, you got that replacement cylinder for my old car?” Hank said, leaning out of the window toward a Torelin man, hefting a whole V8 engine block over his shoulder from the open bay doors of *Brukus’ Breaks, Pads, Boosters, and Balancing.*  


Brukus paused and turned toward them, the light playing off his horns, amber fur, and oil-stained overalls. He was gargantuan, even by his species' standards. Luke would likely only come up to the alien man’s abs.  


Torelin were bull-like bipeds, but to the average Human, they were the spitting image of a Minotaur from ancient myth. They typically had broad shoulders, muscles bulging from underneath thin hair-like fur, and a set of horns pulled right off a Texas longhorn.  


Luke had heard the females of their species were a bit softer and did not have a look of perpetual hatred in their eyes, but he had never seen one, so as far as he was concerned, the entire species looked like they always wanted to kill you.  


“I got it right here,” Brukus said, shaking the engine over his shoulder, looking like he was lifting mere pounds, not a whole ton.  


“That’s great,” Hank said. “Want me to tow the beast over later?”  


“Not today. I still have to finish Mikey’s ride. But I can get you yours tomorrow,” Brukus said, stepping over and stopping slightly to look into the cab.  


He looked over at Luke, his sharp, hate-filled eyes scanning him for a hidden weapon or intent. He found nothing but another outsider. A man who would run away soon enough. “And who is this?”  


“Ah, this here is Luke, he is goin’ up to Kurkel’s place too,” Hank said, but stopped and looked back at Luke. “Well, I don’t rightly know why he is heading there, but he seems like a good lad.”  


“So, what are you heading up there for----Luke,” Brukus raised a brow and snorted, adding Luke’s name like it was an afterthought.  


“I took up a contract they sent to Olympus Mons. I’m supposed to help out with getting the ranch running in the green,” Luke explained flatly, trying not to feel intimidated by the freakishly sized man.  


“I see, well, that’s good. Murel has been having a tough time of it since she came back home,” Brukus said, scratching a short bit of hair on his chin that looked somewhat like a goatee.  


“Who is Murel? I was told the place was owned and run by Kurkel?” Luke asked.  


Hank and Brukus shared a glance, a dour look befalling both of them. Kurkel must have been a sensitive subject around town.  


“Well, he did own it for many years. But about a decade ago, his wife passed, and about five years ago, Murel wandered off to Europe for art school. Running that big ol’ place on his own took its toll, and last year Kurkel went off an’ died,” Hank said, making the sign of the cross in the air. “God bless his soul.”  


“And Murel came back to run the farm and can’t pull it out from the red?” Luke asked.  


“That’s the long and short of it,” Hank confirmed.  


That certainly changed the perspective of the situation at hand. Luke truly had no idea what was going on at Golden Fields. Years of neglect from Kurkel, and now his daughter, who, based on her chosen field of study, had no heart for farming or ranching. Who knew what state Golden Fields was in?  


The entire area could resemble anything from an overgrown rainforest to a horrendously arid savannah. Both extremes were easily doable with the wrong farming techniques or biotechnology.  


“Oi, kid,” Brukus said, pulling Luke out of his daydream. “When you get there, do me a favor and be patient with Murel, and also don’t mention her dad. She is a nice woman, and that is still a sensitive topic. So working out what happened to the farm might be a bit of a minefield if you lay all the blame on a dead man...or her.”  


“Don’t worry. I wasn’t planning on doing that. It’s not my job to judge how something ended up that way. My job is to find solutions,” Luke explained, knowing these two likely had heard that spiel from his type before. Everyone in his field of study knew that was the creed the government forced upon them.   


“But, I will do my best to be sensitive,” Luke finished.  


“Perfect, ‘Cause if yah’ don’t” Burkus nodded, before turning away and heading back into his workshop, not looking back as Hank waved goodbye and shouted a time he would bring the car over. All Burkus did as an acknowledgement of the comment was whip his tail and lightly nod.  


With goodbyes said and what Luke took as a warning all done, he and Hank rolled on through the rest of the little town without any further delays. Before Luke knew it, they had taken the road north out of town, leaving behind the blacktop and returning to dirt.  


Blooms of dust kicked up as they rumbled along, coating the wooden fences and bumper. They did not speak much as they completed the last of the drive. Up and over a pine-covered hill, and five minutes more was all it took.  


Off in the distance over the swaying fields of untended, wildly growing wheat was the main ranch gate of Golden Fields. Luke’s salvation, and his only chance at a future.   


The wooden fence attached to the gate was in disrepair, with crossbeams fallen or missing in many spots. Where it was not falling apart, vines lashed it together.  


As they neared the gate, the state of decay of the sign was immediately evident. The Slab Serif font clearly displayed the name, but old cracks ran through the chipped paint.  


Two Iron rod gates should have been closed along with a cattle guard. But the gates were open, and rusted in that position. Meanwhile, the cattle guard was so full of dirt that the truck ambled over it without so much as a change in sound.  


Luke's salvation was looking more like a prison sentence by the second.  


Once past the gates, they traversed a small orchard, all overgrown as well. Detritus and unpicked fruits from last year’s harvest rotted on the ground, to the delight of the dozens of rodents that skittered throughout the boughs and foliage.  
“What did they grow here?” Luke asked, nearly gagging on the sickly sweet rot rolling in through the open window, not being able to identify the trees clearly due to how well and truly overgrown they all were.  
	“Oh, they grew quite a few fruit here... Le’me think...” Hank said, chewing on his lip for a moment. “Mostly pears, peaches, and some cherries. I do know that Murel planted an avocado tree near her window as a little lass, but they never sold any of them.”  


None of that was odd for the region. All of those plants grow well within this climate. This area of Montana, although it experienced long winters, sometimes with the first snows arriving as early as late August, was also blessed with a robust summer and growing season.  


The real challenge for farmers was managing to harvest enough crops within a short timeframe to bring to market and satisfy the coalition tithes. It was not impossible for the average farmer, but if the state of the fields was anything to go by, Luke knew that harvesting yield was one issue he and Morel would have to discuss in great detail.  


The truck burst through the tree branches, sending budding fruit and twigs bouncing off the cab with dull thunks. Luke gaped as his new home came entirely into view.  


This was not just a house, no, it was an industrial compound.  


Nearly a dozen buildings of various sizes and purposes were bathed in the vibrant yellow sunlight. Most were easy to identify even from this high vantage: garage, the main barn, crop processing, and what looked like workers' lodging.



There were a few he could not identify, but he knew they were likely miscellaneous storage or possibly coops and habitats for smaller animals. But those were questions he could answer later. What drew Luke's eye was the central house.  


It was built with two floors, but stood nearly as tall as a standard four-story building. It had vibrant wood walls, a green metal roof, and was shaded beneath several mighty oak trees and a tiny avocado tree.   


The main lodge sported enough windows that anyone inside would have surely already spotted their approach, a theory that was given credence less than a minute later.   


As Hank pulled up and stopped just before a set of stairs that led up to the porch, the door to the main house opened, and out stepped a woman that Luke could have never seen coming.  


She was stunning, almost otherworldly,  


She took a moment and adjusted her tight plaid button-up shirt, trying to show off slightly less cleavage, but that was a pointless effort. Her bust was as bountiful as an autumn harvest, but in no way looked out of place, given her staggering height and luscious hourglass figure; much like Burkus, the top of Luke's head barely reached her chest.   


Morel gave up on buttoning the top few clasps and smiled before sauntering forward, her hips swaying with a bold confidence that could only be showcased in such tight-fitting jeans. Morel’s smile nearly knocked Luke on his ass.   


The small poof ball at the tip of her tail peaked out on occasion as it swayed in opposite time with her confidently swaying waist.  


As she stepped down the stairs, her polished hooves clopped on the planks. Her tussled bob cut hair shone with a brilliance that would make the sun envious. Peeking out from the shimmering golden weaves was a set of white horns that curved like ivory spears toward the sky.  


“Why hello there, Hank, to what do I owe the pleasure?” Morel said in a voice as sweet as apple pie, and thick with the southern accent of the women who baked the best ones.  


“Hello, there, little Miss Morel,” Hank tipped his cap and looked over at Luke. “Oh, I just found this ‘ere youngin’ traipsing up the road, bound for here. So I gave him a little lift.”  


“Oh, did you now?” Morel said, turning her attention to Luke.  


Her forest green eyes scanned him quickly, not in a judgmental way, but more as if she was giving the strange man at her home a once-over and gaining her first impression. Whatever Morel saw, she must not have hated, because her smile grew to reach her eyes, pushing that little mole beside her plush lips to move.  


“Well, thank you for bringing him here. I will be sure to give him a ride wherever he may need once our business is done,” Morel said, looking back at Hank.  


“Ain’t nothing.” Hank waved, before a realization of something appeared in his aged eyes. “Oh yeah, if you want, you're more than welcome to come over for supper. “Holly made ten bean soup. We would love to have you and Luke there to swing on by.”  


“That does sound good. I will see if I can make it over. I have to see what Luke wants first. But I will let you know,” Morel replied.  


“Alright, then. I hope you two kids have a nice time,” Hank said, looking over at Luke and giving him a wink, one that Morel saw clear as day.  


Hank turned the car around and left. Morel and Luke watched as the vehicle reached the orchard at the hilltop. Once gone, Morel addressed Luke. “Sorry if he said anything odd. Uncle Hank is a bit...much,” Morel said, scratching behind her head and blushing slightly.  


“He didn’t seem that bad. But Uncle?” Luke asked.  


“He is not my actual uncle, but he and his wife watched me when my parents were busy, so they are my auntie and uncle,” Morel explained. “But, enough about that. What can I do for you? I don’t get a lot of visitors these days.”  


“My professor sent me here. He said you all needed help with your farm and were offering lodging and meals as compensation.” Luke said, turning his data slate around so Morel could see the Emails sent from Kurkel to Dimula, asking desperately for help.  


Morel took hold of the dataslate, but paused and gestured toward some chairs on the porch. “Would it be alright if we go sit down while I read this over?”  


“Of course,” Luke replied, not having much of a choice.  


He followed Morel up the stairs and averted his eyes from her shapely rear. He had enough issues with women; lingering on the attractiveness of Morel would only cause him more trouble. Once at the chairs, Luke clamored into one of them, it being slightly too large for him, making him look like a kid at the adults' table for the first time.  


“Wait right here, sug’, I’m going to get us some refreshments,” Morel cooed, setting the data slate down and heading into the house.  


Through the open window, Morel's humming could be heard. It was as smooth as silk, filled with joy and jubilation. He looked across the yard, listening to her slow, meandering song. It was paced to fill the early spring day perfectly.  


Rabbits hopped inside some pens around their homes across the yard. Their little noses rooted around through clovers and small flowers, searching for the most succulent petals. Although technically a ranch, there was no sign of any cattle, horses, or other large animals. Luke did find that to be slightly odd, but for all he knew, the animals were deeper within the several thousand acres Murel owned.  


Luke yelped as a light swat patted against his leg, wrenching him from his thoughts of what was going on at the farm; interruptions to his idle thoughts seemed to be a theme for the day. It was as if the universe itself did not wish to allow him to bury his pain in work and forget what she did.  


He retreated slightly on the chair, pulling his legs up before hesitantly peering over the side, looking for the aggressor. All he saw was the simple wooden deck. He was about to call out to Morel to ask about rodents when a light mew brought his attention to his side.   


A small amber kitten rubbed against his flank, having used his fright to ascend the chair unnoticed. If it were a snake, it would have bitten him.   


“Hey there, little guy,” Luke said, reaching down to stroke along the now purring kitten’s back. The little fuzz ball was more than happy to receive the affection, nuzzling into his dirty stomach and moving to settle in atop Luke’s lap.  


By the time Morel had returned, the kitten had fallen asleep, curled up like he owned the Human. That or that Luke was his new favorite perch to look out across the yard in search of mice.   


“Your cat is cute,” Luke said, as Morel placed a platter on the table.  


“Cat?” Morel tilted her head, her bovine-like ears fluttering in curiosity.  


“Yeah,” Luke pointed at the little kitten.  


Morel peered over the edge of the table and frowned before settling down and pushing the tray toward Luke. “He is just a barn cat. I can’t rightly say he is mine. He won’t even let me touch him.”  


Luke frowned and looked down at the cat. He understood why it was untrusting of Morel. He was young, likely only born a few months earlier. With no other signs of other fauna near Morel's size, she likely intimidated the little thing.   


“Don’t worry, I’m certain he will warm up to you,” Luke said, picking up his tea and taking a sip.  


“Hopefully. The only friend I’ve had since moving back has been the bunnies over there,” Morel sighed, pointing at the rabbit enclosure.  


“No other animals on the ranch?”  


“Not currently. I had to sell the herd last spring to make tithe,” Morel’s breathed, her ears drooping.  


“Well, that’s a pickle.”  


“Yeah, but that is in the past and not your concern, let me take a look at this,” Morel said, picking up the dataslate and opening the Email. “Please help yourself to some snacks or more tea.”  


Luke did just that while Morel reviewed the transmissions. The spread was delicious and shockingly artistic.  Fresh fruit and vegetables, along with multiple types of dip, were arranged in an intricate flower pattern, with each petal constructed from a different kind of snack.  


Arranged beneath the flower, representing dirt, were crackers of various types of bread: rye, white, garlic, and even a succulently hardy nut loaf.  


To wash it all down, Morel had blessed Luke with sweet tea that would give you diabetes if you did not monitor your intake. That drink was a true boon for Luke. After his miles and miles of walking, he needed something to drink; so much so that by the time Morel had finished reading, he had sucked down half of the pitcher.  


“Alright, Luke. This is definitely something my father had sent to your professor. But this is the first I’ve heard about it,” Morel said, taking up her own beverage and looking out over the fields ponderously.  


“And you don’t want to honor it?” Luke asked, assuming the worst possible scenario.  


Morel took a sip of her drink to wash down a cracker. She did not answer for a minute, leaving Luke to fear for the sanctuary he had been promised and desperately needed. But eventually she swirled her glass, sighed, and looked back at Luke.   


“I never said that I would not; in fact. I really do need some help around here,” Morel said.  


“So I can stay?” Luke asked.  


“Aye, you can, so long as I still have the farm and you are willing to help me fix it,” Morel said.  


“Of course I will help,” Luke agreed. “But I do have a question. “What do you mean by so long as you have it? Is the coalition saying they are ready to replace you and take the farm?”  


“Do you have time for a story? Or would you rather I get you set up in a room first?” Morel questioned.  


“Please, if I’m going to help, I need to know what’s going on.”  


“Alright.” Morel sighed, pouring herself another drink and grabbing a tomato. She bit into it and chewed on it slowly, like cud, while ruminating on the past events, organizing them in a way that would make the explanation easier to digest. After she swallowed, Morel looked over at Luke with a pained gleam in her vibrant eyes. “Alright, so this is the situation....”

1o1oqhe,https://i.redd.it/l3ugj3dfnytf1.jpeg,I *FINALLY* have a successful Home Business setup! I learned A LOT. (Business and Hobbies Expansion),"After a few lot changes, rebuilds, and a new save - I finally have a home shop that runs *SO* smoothly and brings in anywhere from $35000 - $60000 in a 12 hour period. And yeah, it’s VERY pink. 😊
It’s a tattoo and painting studio studio that sells (mostly) crystals and artwork made by my active sims (only excellent or masterpieces so that’s why it’s so bare right now). 

I had a few attempts that didn’t do too well so I thought I’d share some tips and things I’ve learned for anyone that’s interested!

I have my business set to hourly rate at 0% markup and my retail items at 50% markup. My first few shops had 8 wall displays and I mostly sold paintings (I’d sell my own plus ones created by customers even if they were poor quality) and sales were SO bad - I’d be lucky to get 2 sales and I was regularly leaving my shop open 24 hours back then. Having too much available for sale seems to backfire. 

Having too much space and/or too many rooms didn’t work out for me. This shop has a whiteboard with tattoo tables on each side and several easels within range of it so my sim can teach classes for both. My old shops had a room per class. One shop even had four floors with different themes (a shop floor, class floor, club floor, and a gaming/internet floor) — I DO NOT recommend that at all lol - most sims never made it past the second floor. 


Hire employees quickly even if they’re not experienced. However, don’t over assign them busy-work in order to get the most out of their services. With this shop, I hired 3 employees with no tattoo experience to tend my tattoo tables (they quickly skilled up so now they bring in over $2000 per tattoo). I also have them clean, fix things, offer paid mentoring, and one random thing like be friendly, the grilled cheese thing, etc. Some of mine tend (but not harvest) my “garden” (I grow the crystals I sell on some crystal trees in the front yard so my trees are always in good shape). 
If you’re running an art studio, I don’t recommend having your employees paint unless you wanna sell their paintings. I also don’t like to let my employees offer lectures because I feel like it doesn’t add profit and that’s what they’ll spend most of their time doing. If you want fame or want endless paintings to sell, don’t have your employees scrap them. You can sell them for fame or extra money or on the wall shelves in your shop. Scraping yourself can be a pain (but worth it IMO) or you can quickly scrap in build mode. 
I have an employees only kitchen with a coffee machine and microwave and fridge so they can snack. 

If you’re wanting to add a little boost or keep people around longer — add “listen to music” as a customer activity and put stereos around. Yeah, they’ll break — but either you or your employees will fix them and I feel like it keeps people hanging around longer. 

Mods & Cheats: I use MCCC to slow down my sims need decay significantly and I use UI cheats in a pinch (mostly for sleep). I don’t wanna waste gameplay time on sleep but that’s a personal choice. I also used the money cheat to get enough money to build my shop and house from the start (I hate rebuilding on the same lot) then readjusted to a realistic amount after building. 

Most of my money comes from services. My sim mostly mentors painting, does tattoos, and usually does a painting class per shift just to keep tattoo tables open for employees.

Y’all probably already know most of this because I’m late to the game BUT I’ve been obsessed for the past several weeks and needed to nerd out over finally finding a “work”flow 🥴

So title says it all.. been in construction since I was 15, im 33 now. I do road construction- milling, asphalt, concrete, watermain you name it we do it. Been at this company for 10 years and was at the previous one for the remaining. ( summers only when I was still in school ) 

Im so over feeling sore and abused everyday. We barely take breaks, maybe one at 9am for coffee then straight shot till 530. 
Im over breathing in all the silica dust and garbage in the air from our work sites. 

I had my son 3 years ago and that changed my entire outlook on everything, I just want to be there for him and not be broken by the time in 50 or even sooner. I herniated 2 disc's a couple years ago and been very sore since. 

I make upwards of $50 an hour with great pension and benefits. 
Its hard for me to take a pay cut, I've been making great money for a very long time and I wouldn't imagine making anything less than 70k that's probably my lowest number and its very hard to find a job that im not around dust or chemicals all day long and make that kind of money without lots of schooling. 

Just been on my mind a lot lately and seemed the need to rant after today's bs day lol. 
Been dealing with a lot of health things for the last 7 years and having a miserable foreman and very labour intensive job on top doesn't make things any better.

When Ken Griffin, Citadel CEO called Bitcoin a “financial jihad” I think no one got more confused by that statement than muslims! 


There is some good literature  out there on bitcoin that could help understand and relate to what Griffin thought was an insult (‘Bitcoin Standard’ by Saifedean Ammous, ‘The anti riba money’ by the muslim bitcoiner, and ‘Broken money’ by Lyn Alden)



For those that dont have the time to read all that, i wanted to write a very short summary on what bitcoin is and why people say it is the anti riba money - and hopefully agree for once with Ken Griffin 😂



**What is money.**


before defining bitcoin, let’s define money.
money is a medium of exchange - meaning a good that can be purchased but not consumed or used for the production of other goods. **including in islam,** there is nothing that stipulates what can or cannot be money. so in the course of history pple have used different kind of money: gold, silver, salt, seashells. 



**what is the objective of money**



the intent of money is to solve 3 human problems:



**Objective 1.** it can be used for varying scales of exchange, so it can be divided,



**Objective 2.** it can be transported across space,



**Objective 3.** it holds its value through time,



so for example, luxury watches satisfy 2,3 but not 1. bananas satisfy 1,2 but not 3. etc
so typically the hardest condition to satisfy is 3.



**Application to Bitcoin vs Fiat vs gold**



**Objective 1.** this part is straightforward a bitcoin transaction on the lightning network costs 0.2% vs 3.5% for a standard credit card transaction. gold is itself not particularly divisible, can’t use it to buy (non-starbucks) coffee.



**Objective 2.** gold shipping is a nightmare and unadapted to the modern digital economy for capital flows. btc is straightforward, all you need is an address. as for fiat - if you work in the wrong sector, or are considered a political activist, you may be shadow banned by the banking and your fiat transfers may be censored, frozen, etc. this applies to countries as well and Libya got 500bn dollars frozen.  



**Objective 3.** gold and bitcoin have similar properties in that they cannot be debased. so both of them hold very well their value through time. as history suggests, fiat is a horrible vehicle to preserve value through inflation cycles




**all in all, bitcoin is simply a technology that perfected the needs that money intends to address.**



**OK but what is the link with riba?!**


under fiat the government can debase the currency - ie increase its own wealth on the back of its constituents. that wealth increase has been shared, in the case of the US, with the military complex (and the financing of wars) and the banking sector, as they intermediate the liquidity injection. for emerging markets, it’s typically serving a small elite and the debasement is even more severe with double/triple digit inflations. it’s textbook riba: unjust increase of wealth. bitcoin is an operating system under which this is physically not possible to debase the money. no one can print it unilaterally. 


**just like riba existed in the gold standard, riba will exist in the future bitcoin standard. bitcoin doesn’t erase injustice but it creates the material conditions for justice to emerge. right now we simply don’t have the means to achieve the vocation of islam - so we ought to create them.**

This contracting company was **losing tons of business** because no one was answering the phone. The owner ran **two different operations**, and only had **one guy** answering calls for both. He was missing calls left and right — potential clients were literally calling competitors instead.

# The difference was crazy:

* Before: dozens of missed calls a week, lost opportunities, stressed owner.
* After: **0 missed calls**, full control of their schedule, and **15–20% more jobs booked** in the first month.

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

**Application to Bitcoin vs Fiat vs gold**



**Objective 1.** this part is straightforward a bitcoin transaction on the lightning network costs 0.2% vs 3.5% for a standard credit card transaction. gold is itself not particularly divisible, can’t use it to buy (non-starbucks) coffee.



**Objective 2.** gold shipping is a nightmare and unadapted to the modern digital economy for capital flows. btc is straightforward, all you need is an address. as for fiat - if you work in the wrong sector, or are considered a political activist, you may be shadow banned by the banking and your fiat transfers may be censored, frozen, etc. this applies to countries as well and Libya got 500bn dollars frozen.  



**Objective 3.** gold and bitcoin have similar properties in that they cannot be debased. so both of them hold very well their value through time. as history suggests, fiat is a horrible vehicle to preserve value through inflation cycles




**all in all, bitcoin is simply a technology that perfected the needs that money intends to address.**



**OK but what is the link with riba?!**


under fiat the government can debase the currency - ie increase its own wealth on the back of its constituents. that wealth increase has been shared, in the case of the US, with the military complex (and the financing of wars) and the banking sector, as they intermediate the liquidity injection. for emerging markets, it’s typically serving a small elite and the debasement is even more severe with double/triple digit inflations. it’s textbook riba: unjust increase of wealth. bitcoin is an operating system under which this is physically not possible to debase the money. no one can print it unilaterally. 


**just like riba existed in the gold standard, riba will exist in the future bitcoin standard. bitcoin doesn’t erase injustice but it creates the material conditions for justice to emerge. right now we simply don’t have the means to achieve the vocation of islam - so we ought to create them.**

1o1ogx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1o1ogx8/advice_on_how_to_tackle_alcohol_4k6k/,Advice on how to tackle alcohol? ($4k-$6k),"My fiancé and I already have our ceremony site booked, and for a while now (up until today) have been planning for a backyard reception to go for more of a chill family party vibe. We were going to have a family friend cook tacos, and have another family friend “bartend” (I say that loosely) just to keep a lid of things and what not. We knew this would be affordable as we would be purchasing all alcohol ourselves. 

Recently, I started having worries about a backyard reception due to many factors. 1. Our wedding is end of August and if it’s like it was this year, it will be so hot. Our ceremony is already outdoors, and I feel bad making our guests suffer the entire day. 2. I’m worried that in event of any inclement weather, we would have to completely cancel as we were hosting at my soon to be mother-in-laws home and can’t just move appropriately 96 people inside. 3. The yard we were having it in is more of a side yard, and isn’t fenced. We are also right off a main road and it has a ton of traffic. This means borderline zero privacy. 

Today just for the heck of it we had a meeting with the event manager of a nearby coffee shop that also has a bar and small event space that can fit a bit over our expected guest count. They are not a traditional reception hall and due to this, they do not offer drink packages of any kind.  They have a pay-per-drink system where the hosts pay for the entire bill or each guest can pay their own like at a regular bar. Drinks are $8.50+ each. This is most likely due to the nature of the events they hold but regardless, it leaves us in a bit of a sticky spot. They said they are completely willing to work with us on how we want the bar to run, and I was thinking of doing some sort of token system. My thought process was select which drinks we want served off the menu and try to keep them all at the same price or around the same price. Then, give each person 3 tokens and pre-pay for the amount in tokens if that makes sense. After that, guests can purchase their own drinks on their own tab.

My fiancé feels like we shouldn’t do the token system because it gets confusing if all of the drinks aren’t the exact same price, and feels we should just pre-pay a certain amount and that’s that—but my worry is that some people will over-do it while others miss out because of the over indulgence of others. Not hating on my guests just trying to have a good time, but I know how it can be when you’re feeling it and putting them down lol. We are expecting to pay about $2,200 on alcohol, but it’s just a matter of one of us feeling like a token system while possibly complicated is the only way to ensure consumption fairness (me) and the other one of us feeling like we will be fine if we just pay that same amount and let people do what they are gonna do (my fiancé).

Does anyone have any input or advice they can give me on how you would go about this or if you personally had a ticket/token bar system in place for your wedding? ",1,1759960265.0,Weddingsunder10k,6,0.67,False

The Ghost in your Videos: https://archiveofourown.org/works/44028672/chapters/110703561

- Enid is a new streamer, and Wednesday is her roommate/best friend. The chat ships them immediately. This story doesn’t take itself too seriously, and is a really great read if you want something cute and easy on the heart strings. There’s a chapter that’s just smut, but 1) the characters are in college, 2) the chapter has no plot points you’ll miss if you skip it, and 3) the author does a great job of warning you up front about it in the author’s notes at the beginning of the chapter.

So This Is Love: https://archiveofourown.org/works/44129421/chapters/110965605

- Shooooooo buddy. What to say about this one. We get to see a different side of Enid, one that’s the sociopath to Wednesday’s psychopath. It’s a much darker story, definitely not for the faint of heart, and absolutely worth the read if you’re looking for something super dark.

say yes to heaven, say yes to me: https://archiveofourown.org/works/45195376/chapters/113697385

- Enid is dying from the weight of her love for Wednesday. I’m a sucker for a good hanahaki disease story, and I think this one is especially fun. 

Four Sugars, Please: https://archiveofourown.org/works/44737594/chapters/112559860

- Wednesday works at a coffee shop and becomes enamored by a customer. But only for writing inspo for her novel. Not gay reasons. Definitely not. It’s cute, it’s soft, and well worth it if you want a little meet-cute, Addams style. 

Magus et Lupus: https://archiveofourown.org/works/44359672/chapters/111563185

- Enid is summoned through the ether to the side of a powerful magi, Wednesday Addams. A medieval AU with a solid story and some really cute interactions between Wednesday, Enid, and the rest of house Addams. 

yours, eurydice: https://archiveofourown.org/works/45586918/chapters/114708547

- Wednesday is a best selling author with a crippling case of writer’s block. Enid is her new next door neighbor. The flow of this work is nice, and I especially enjoy the bits of world-building sprinkled in.

I’ve been experimenting with small automations lately, and a few months ago a café near my place asked if I could help them boost footfall on their slower days. Mondays and Tuesdays were dead, even though weekends were packed.

We built something simple: a QR code at the counter that says *“Get a free drink on your next visit.”* When people scanned it, it opened a short form where they entered their name, phone, and birthday.

Once they submitted, the data went into a Google Sheet automatically. Then on slow days, the café could send a short SMS or WhatsApp blast to everyone  things like *“Free pastry with any coffee today”* or *“Buy one, get one cappuccino till 5 PM.”*

 Just a QR, a form, and a message lol.

Within the first few weeks, hundreds of customers had signed up. Now whenever they send a message, people actually show up  sometimes within an hour. Mondays and Tuesdays went from empty to lively, without extra ad spend.

It’s honestly one of the simplest automations I’ve built, but the impact was huge. It showed me that cafés don’t need big systems  just small tech that connects well with customers.",9,1759960065.0,barista,1,1.0,False

When I was a teen I lived 100% of the time in my head so I didn't pay too much attention to her, like i was always thinking:""yeah she's too good for me, never mind..."". So we were kinda friends?

She texted me a month ago, after 10 years, basically each week after that she texted me some random thing (VERY RANDOM) so this time I did try something out to see how much she's interested in reconnecting.

I've invited her to my house for a coffee and she accepted pretty fast.   


UPDATE:   
We met today at my house and immediately started talking about a wide range of topics. It was very interesting because we have quite opposing views on some topics.

Anyway, after about three hours of chatting, I asked her directly why she'd texted me. I couldn't get a satisfactory answer. However, she told me she always had a very good opinion of me, even though we hadn't seen each other for a long time, and she told me how important I was to her in her memories.  


I was very flattered, so  I approached her and gave her a hug, a pretty long one.

And I explicitly asked her, ""So, shall we see each other soon?""   
  
As I asked, I looked her straight in the eye, leaned closer, and lowered my voice to let her know I had romantic intentions, but maybe I should have been more explicit on this.   
  
She answered ""Sure!"" probably because of the circumstances or because she simply enjoyed the conversation we had today and wants to keep me as a friend.  


It was a very strange interaction but, honestly, I'm happy with how it went.  
Even if she decided not to see me again, it would be okay: I had a great time!

Her mother had wanted a boy instead of a girl, so Brixley was often left to defend for herself most days. Her relationships had never gone right, according to everyone; she couldn't keep one long enough to see where it would lead. Her first love when she was 16 was her brother's best friend Rowan, whom she would call Ro. Her brother took notice of the eye-catching and even sudden flirtatious hints here and there between the two. Harley told their mom, Gabriel, about the sudden, strange interaction and that Brixley was harassing and even assaulting Rowen. How she would make sexual jokes to Rowen when it was never even mentioned? Rowen felt uncomfortable around her. He even lied and said Brixley tried to force Rowen to kiss her. Went as far as saying Brixley was trying to force herself onto Rowen. Harly told Gabriel that Rowen told him, if Brixley was around, he didn't want to stay friends with him. Gabriel didn't believe a word Brixley told her, the tears screamed for her mother to listen, to believe her. Gabriel didn't like the idea of Brixley trying to come between Harley and Rowen's friendship, so her mother banned her from being around Rowen. Brixley was upset and very disappointed; she couldn't accept the idea of her having to be stuck in her room when Rowen was around. Her anger was only getting worse, and she didn't have a soul to understand how she was feeling. She had nothing to her name, just a mattress on a floor she called her bed. What was she supposed to do? She didn't even have a phone, but guess who did? She felt like she was going crazy. The endless days that she had to be locked away, she called her prison. What made things worse was that Harley would just invite Rowen over, so Brixley couldn't come out of her cage. He would make fun of Brixley through her locked door, calling her, 'Pervert Brix.' and say that Rowen was there when her mom was at work, but reality kicked in; Rowen wasn't actually there most days. On the days she did come out, she was on a strict schedule; she couldn't stay out past 5, and if she saw Rowen, she had to walk past or turn the other way. She wanted to scream, cry, fight, and just lie down and never wake again. She didn't have any friends because Harley would turn them against her; he would date her best friend and have her turn against Brixley. That was okay, according to her mother's own words. One day, when Brixley was out, she was hiding away by a lake. She called her, 'Peaceful sanity.' Rowen showed up and gave Brixley money; he told her he had been saving for months, so she could expect it was enough to start with, and for that, Brixley was thankful. Rowen asked for one thing in return, a kiss goodbye, and he promised that he would be the one to walk into that coffee shop and marry the girl he loves. 

A year has passed, and she is trying to move on from Rowen. She hasn't spoken to her mom or brother, ain't ever planning on speaking to them ever again. She waits to see if Rowen will walk through those doors. Instead, she got this jerk face, who can't even figure out if he wants to flirt or fight. She has to learn how to walk away when guys act like this, but Brixley doesn't know how to. She is still learning about relationships, and what she wants. He would flirt with her, and when she wanted in for a kiss, he suddenly got angry with her. Only if Rowen could just walk in, and save her from this curse she calls dating.

After I “Break Up” She started texting me more and more but in that moment I was already out in my mind. I tried to give her the reasons so She also quits so I told her that her vegeterian diet is kinda deal breaker in long run, her feminist views about everything, etc… I was doing everything that She doesnt Like me but She kept pursuing me and She started pulling up the sex topic a LOT, asking me for dic pic, about size, etc and just Talking about it all the time which was kinda turn off for me even more. After We went for another date and it was great, We stayed for long, She invited me to her place but I rejected and told her I can come tomorrow. 

Tomorrow We went for a coffee and after date We Had a plan to go to her place which We did. On coffee We talked about some views of relationship and I Made comments Like “ For me is unnecaptable that Married woman goes out with single friends, or travel abroad with friends, and things Like that” She didn’t Like those views and I think its first time She heard it so directly, I asked her about having a Children cuz She told She took fertility tests few days ago so I asked in what time span We would consider that knowing her age, but mine also and She Said one year which was good from My side. 

Later on We went to her House and soon we started cuddle and Getting really close, We were Like that for 2-3h, watching TV and just Talk and cuddle but I noticed that She avoid kissing even If I didn’t really tried so I though “ok I will go for it now and see” and She just squizzed and rejected. So I asked whats the issue and She Made comment like “first you show me D than I give you the kiss” and smth Like that but in a joking Way so We just continued cuddling and whatever, She took my hand and put in her pants and all kind of things but no kiss so it got into my head and when was about the time that I go home, around mid night I asked and She told me its Because of my comments on going to disco with friends and traveling and She dont know If We should see each other again so I just said “That’s what I was telling you for some time, We have different views on relationship so I guess this will be last Goodbye and I just stood up and left. She was kinda shocked and surprised cuz I left so quickly and I said “When I think better,I wont even say Goodbye cuz yoh could told me that before taking me to your place” and She said “But I wanted to cuddle so bad”… I just left and felt kinda used but ok, its all good after 15 mins. Later She texted me that She didn’t want it to End Like that, that She feel bad… I said its ok Because I enjoyed out time and That’s it. After She sent few memes that reminds of some topics We talked about and I didn’t reply anything. I expect her to invite me again for a date to make things work so I dont know If its worth of even going to another, what do you think ?",1,1759959478.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

> Among the many fascinating UFO encounters reported over the last fifty years, those in which UFOs actually land and humanoid beings emerge are particularly compelling. These cases have been documented across the world. The cases presented in this video include the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France, and England. Spanning five decades, these incidents showcase a remarkable variety of humanoid figures and often involve multiple witnesses. Many of the cases include some form of tangible evidence, such as landing traces, unusual animal behavior, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic phenomena, and physiological reactions. In several instances, government involvement is noted, and some witnesses have even reported unsettling threats from mysterious ""men in black.""

1o1o2ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainableCocoa/comments/1o1o2ii/cocoa_is_in_crisis_even_with_record_prices/,"🌍 Cocoa is in crisis — even with record prices, farmers are poorer than ever, says 2025 Cocoa Barometer","https://preview.redd.it/ki6c1lafiytf1.jpg?width=4200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6c57db3dc614b7ec835b4a41c81ab4edd32b732

Cocoa prices hit historic highs this year — over **$10,000 per tonne in May 2025**, up nearly 400% from their long-term average — yet the smallholder farmers who grow the beans behind our chocolate are still earning below a living income.

That’s the stark message from the **2025 Cocoa Barometer**, the latest global report by the **VOICE Network**, which tracks sustainability and human rights in the chocolate industry.

The report calls the cocoa sector a **“polycrisis”** — where climate shocks, crop disease, illegal mining, deforestation, gender inequality, and bad governance all collide. Despite decades of sustainability promises, the people producing the world’s cocoa still face structural poverty.

**Some key findings:**

* 🌧️ **El Niño and disease outbreaks** devastated crops in Ghana (-31%) and Côte d’Ivoire (-25%), pushing global supply down 13%.
* 💰 **Farmers didn’t benefit from record world prices** because of fixed farmgate systems and long-term forward contracts that lock in low returns.
* 🧾 **“Good Purchasing Practices”** are now a major focus — companies need transparent, long-term contracts that pay for *risk* and *rights*, not just beans.
* 🌳 **Deforestation is resurging** as farmers expand into new frontiers in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Liberia to chase high prices.
* 👩🏾‍🌾 **Women farmers** are still excluded from most payments and training, even though empowering them improves income and sustainability outcomes.
* 💻 **Data inequality** is growing — companies and governments hold all the production data, while most farmers have none of their own.
* 🪙 The **living income gap** in cocoa farming is estimated at **$10 billion a year**.

Even with more regulation (like the EU’s new deforestation-free imports law), the report warns that costs and compliance are being pushed down to farmers — many of whom can’t afford them.

**The takeaway:**

If cocoa is to survive climate change and remain ethical, the industry has to move beyond logos and certifications. Farmers must earn a living income, have access to their own data, and be part of how sustainability rules are written.

**Discussion prompt:**

Why do you think cocoa (and other commodities like coffee or palm oil) keep falling into this boom-bust, poverty cycle — even with “sustainability” programs everywhere?

What real-world changes could make the system fair for farmers *and* sustainable for the planet?

1o1o15e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1o1o15e/frustrated_at_cavities/,Frustrated at Cavities,"Felt so bad yesterday after going to three appointments. Went to see my psychologist, got my allergy shots done (so painful, I missed the nurse who doesn't it gently), and then the dentist for a cleaning.

It was such a hard day already, but of course the dentist comes in to do her two minute exam and check up on the teeth that needed to be watched from LAST time because cavities were forming. Or course the cavity has formed and needs to be filled. 

The dentist didn't do anything terrible, but was off putting. First she tells me to stop watching TV and move my head, I wasn't watching tv my eyes were closed lmao  most comfortable wearing my glasses during dental procedures, so I can look at the TV every once in a while and also just close my eyes because it's overwhelming.

Then she asks if I'm brushing my teeth with extra fluoride toothpaste, I say yes, two times a day. This was a treatment that my last dentist wanted me to do when I was in in March. Then the dentist tells me that I need to brush the back side of molars. I confirm the teeth she's talking about, and tell her that I actually do, all the time. Then I found myself getting frustrated at the cavity, I say ""every time I come in here I have a new fucking cavity"" (can't remember if I swore or not, I feel like swearing now) telling the dentist and the assistant that I am doing all I can, and what more could I possibly do? 

The dentist just awkwardly apologizes, tells me to put the flouride toothpaste directly on the teeth with the cavity, and she eventually leaves after identifying ANOTHER cavity to keep an eye on.


Seriously frustrating. The assistant was very kind afterwards and acknowledged that my teeth never bled when she flossed them, obviously I'm flossing regularly and taking care of my teeth 💔 she told me to make sure to eat a protein at the same time that I'm eating something acidic and that can cut the acidity in my mouth. Also drink more water (I drink enough).

I do like an energy drink, so I guess I have to cut those out of my diet entirely. Not cutting my morning coffee. I don't eat chocolate or candy that much anymore, every once in awhile.

Just felt so sad and upset. Actually cried after the appointment and driving to the vets office to pick up cat food and medicine. 

Honestly I'm developing a cavity twice to three times a year!!!!! Every tooth is going to have a cavity, what a fucking shit show. And I HATE THE DENTIST. Just sitting there with my mouth opened, it's soooooo annoying, scratching and stabbing. Getting a cavity filled is a nightmare.

I suppose I might just have genetics that make it easier for me to get cavities, or even childhood trauma that may have contributed. It's just extremely annoying to even have a dentist make little comments. I had a rough day, so I probably took it too personally as well ❤️‍🩹

This contracting company was **losing tons of business** because no one was answering the phone. The owner ran **two different operations**, and only had **one guy** answering calls for both. He was missing calls left and right — potential clients were literally calling competitors instead.

So I built them a **voice AI agent** that picks up calls instantly, greets customers professionally, answers basic questions, and **books appointments directly into their calendar**.

# The difference was crazy:

* Before: dozens of missed calls a week, lost opportunities, stressed owner.
* After: **0 missed calls**, full control of their schedule, and **15–20% more jobs booked** in the first month.

The owner told me he felt like he “finally hired a reliable employee who never sleeps.”

And the best part?  
That “employee” costs less than a coffee per day. 

If you’ve got a small business (or clients who do) that’s struggling with missed calls, lead follow-ups, or scheduling headaches — **AI voice agents are a total game changer**.

I made $1,000 on this first project alone, and I’m already working on my next one.

'$1.5 billion cost millions of Aussies 'prepared to accept' as RBA surcharge ban looms (let's apply some critical thinking)' - Do not know where the article gets off saying that this will cost $1.5bn. If this cost is passed on through to consumers as higher pricing, the result will be no change.

Cui bono - always ask this question, whose benefit? 

'But [payments giant Mastercard](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-reveals-dire-15-billion-consequence-for-everyday-aussies-if-rba-surcharge-ban-goes-ahead-034710707.html) has warned that retailers will pass on the amount to customers through general prices if surcharges are banned.' - Mastercard says its a bad idea. Mastercard makes 1.5% on all transactions it processes. Oh no.

'He said surcharge savings would unlikely be [passed on to consumers](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-reveals-dire-15-billion-consequence-for-everyday-aussies-if-rba-surcharge-ban-goes-ahead-034710707.html) and there would be ""unintended consequences"" for everyday Aussies, with an estimated $1.5 billion per year cost increase through higher prices, meaning cash-loving Aussies couldn't avoid paying more.' - Fart bubble from MC. 

There's a reason GST is included in pricing. Shopping with an immediate total cost let's consumers find the lowest price in a given market. Hidden fees and surcharges are a way to obfuscate and confuse the customer in the process.

'New research from [Money.com.au](http://Money.com.au) found 56 per cent of Aussies weren’t opposed to businesses raising everyday prices to offset shouldering card-processing costs. This was based on a nationally representative survey of more than 1,000 people.'

If interbank fees are lowered, then this cost saving will eventually end up saving the consumer.

Let's be clear here the cost of bank infrastructure is baked in, credit/debit transactions are a part of a larger system. The cost of dealing with currency is a major pain point for banks and businesses. It is cheaper to run a credit/debit transaction than handle cash for banks. Period.

MC, Amex, VISA, Apple, Google all rely on these fees being passed on, 1-3% on transactions across the globe is a house rake. These are American companies taking a cut everytime you get a coffee. 

The current system allows for obfuscation in the consumer transaction market.

1o1np0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/comments/1o1np0k/recollecting_theories/,(Re-)Collecting Theories.,"Isn't it ironic that the one thing that doesn't get out of our heads right now is >!amnesia!<?

The last three chapters had me on the edge of my seat. I usually blaze through new chapters like the rest of you, but these were special. My mind demanded short breaks here and there to mentally prepare myself for what's to come. Momo kind of died, then didn’t; the biggest arc so far ended almost abruptly, and suddenly the main character forgets everything. We somehow have to cope with the fact that Tatsu dared to actually try to make one of the most resented and infamous tropes into something hopefully amazing. Up until this point, Dandadan felt very safe to me. It followed a simple formula of alternating between sweet, wholesome, and refreshing romance development and action-packed adventures. To me at least, it didn’t feel like Tatsu wanted to reinvent the wheel but just take the good aspects of everything he could think of and illustrate them beautifully. This upcoming arc feels different.

If the past were a diversified exchange-traded fund that can have ups and downs but gets better over time and is a long-term investment, this arc feels like short-selling with leverage. And on amnesia of all things. Like I said in the beginning, it feels ironic that this may be the most memorable arc of Dandadan so far. This could be a breaking point where Dandadan either falls off dramatically or reaches a whole new level of greatness.

In this post, I want to gather and revisit some things that we know, along with those that people have developed over the last few weeks and months regarding this new arc. Many people have made amazing contributions, and I want to compile them in one place. Maybe you just caught up with the manga and are now wondering how this community reacted to the last few chapters. This post might be a good starting point.

# What we know so far (Ch. 209-212)

I will not recap the chapters here because our good friend [u/IronDude\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/IronDude_/s/NtkaF4eILc) already did. You can read his summaries and opinions here

* [Let's talk about chapter 209](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/6FDsvHrfad)
* [Let's talk about Chapter 210](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/PuUUMv6Cz8)
* [Let's talk about Chapter 211](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/UAY7Vt95UH)
* [Let's talk about Chapter 212](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/EgGZcGM2Ug)

I highly recommend reading them all, as they contain extra information that you might not be aware of if you only read the chapters. For example, the discussion of chapter 209 contains some fascinating insights from u/Ayase-Momo regarding the location of the temple and its meaning.

Now that you've read the recaps, let's talk about some things that we learned.

# Failed Theories

In Chapter 209, three prominent theories were discussed regarding what happened there. None of them suggested that Momo might lose her memories. This is interesting because memory loss was one of the top comments on MangaPlus even right after the chapter dropped. But before we discuss why this should have been on our radar sooner, let's quickly go over the failed early theories.

**Timeskip Theory**

When people saw the last image of Momo, they thought her hair looked longer than normal and took that as a hint that a lot of time had passed. The theory states that the ritual could only be performed at the hours of the ox on the day of the supermoon.

https://preview.redd.it/4pz0fctxeytf1.jpg?width=1223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7aa92de00a72d96a65aab79606e972d9e9ddaff2

We know that Momo missed this timing in chapter 209, and there is no indication of how much time has passed since she disappeared from our sight. Therefore, it's possible that she was gone for a long time until the next window of opportunity arose. The definite proof of her hair being longer was this shadow behind her:

https://preview.redd.it/icvj5txzeytf1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95d7118d0481c06f603acb91453f7b2ae314dd47

Someone even [measured it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/Df2fEgp0Lf) without the shadow and suggested it to be longer than normal. [One more theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/AHkGU2shGQ) suggested it was exactly one year that she was absent until the Rokken Sect found her.

In hindsight we of course know this didn't happen but most people were unconvinced from the get go. This theory was also the target of some memes with some people even [editing old chapters to make her hair look way longer than it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/wupwum1tcX).

From a narrative perspective, the theory was also horrible, as the world would have moved on without her. One whole year at least with nobody, including Okarun, remembering Momo? And then she suddenly appears again? Amnesia at least only changes one character, a timeskip would have completely changes *every* character. I think it's a good thing this didn't happen. This doesn't mean that we won't ever get a timeskip at some point. But it would require a more elaborate setup from Tatsu to pull it off.

**The Spirit World Theory**

I want to keep this short, because I honestly haven't thought about this theory too much. It suggests that Momo has entered the spirit world and will learn more about her ID cosmos while she's there. This theory seems debunked as Momo is clearly not in the spirit world right now.

... Or is she? Let's remember this one for later.

**The Everyone Forgot Her Theory**

We know that people forgot about her as time went on. Even Seiko had trouble remembering her clearly on the plane. Only Jiji and interestingly Okarun seemed to never have forgotten about her. Momo herself said the curse could make her end up like the pygmies where everyone forgets about her existence.

https://preview.redd.it/56tfcta1fytf1.jpg?width=1194&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca2a5bfbd676dabc79265482ec574cbe24fd1844

This theory was absolutely possible. It didn't happen of course, but there was basically no evidence against it. This is essentially amnesia, but reversed and with everyone else but Momo. So if you don't like amnesia, be glad that *this theory* didn't happen.

**Amnesia Theory**

This is what happened in the end. We essentially got confirmation on that in Chapter 210 which stands as the most controversial chapter of Dandadan so far. But how did some people think of that?

We established the connection of the curse to the pygmies. Momo said as much and you wouldn't have this information be the ending of a chapter if it weren't relevant. But there was another piece of information earlier in chapter 175.

https://preview.redd.it/lifqopd2fytf1.jpg?width=965&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9799beddf56cbc460666618398168465a71bc3c2

If Momo became like a pygmy, she might forget herself.

This theory was heavily debated even before we got confirmation. Most prominently the post from u/TheAmplifier8.

[Why a Popular Theory is a Narrative Trap (and Why Tatsu Won't Fall For It)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/v1pFVGys5y)

You should definitely read his post to understand the next section better. He probably contributed to some extent to the fallout that would come later as his post was incredibly well-crafted and detailed. I also completely agreed with him, although I disliked timeskip way more than amnesia.

# Cope Theories

Chapter 210 left the community in shambles. The chapter got tons of negative feedback with some people even saying that they're gonna drop the manga now, because they despise the amnesia trope so much. Others tried to remain calm by claiming that Tatsu always subverted tropes like these and will not let us down. Whether you belonged to any of these groups or didn't get to experience it firsthand yourself, you're now here and still reading Dandadan probably.

People were pissed about amnesia. So pissed in fact, that they simply rejected it. We will now take a look at what I call ""cope theories"". These are theories, that reject the assumption of ""Momo lost her memories"" and go from there.

**Cope Theory 1: The Imposter Theory**

What if that girl we see there isn't actually Momo but someone or something else? An imposter? This theory was refined by none other than u/TheAmplifier8 again.

[Why a Popular Theory is a Red Herring - Body Snatcher Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/s/VnL9Fr62FY)

Evidence includes many strange behavioral patterns that we're not used to seeing from Momo.

* she referred to Seiko as her guardian.
* she likes coffee (which is something we simply never knew about her)
* she didn't recognize Jiji even though she did immediately recognized him early on in the series

Just to name a few, there are many more and I invite you to reread the chapters with this information in mind. The latest chapter (212) also contains indications that could be interpreted in favor of this theory. There are absolutely other ways this could go, but it's an interesting start and shows the potential of the cope theories.

Now there is absolutely no confirmation yet, whether this theory is right or wrong. It's the kind of theory, that would be a big plot-twist later on, instead of being revealed right away.

I personally don't believe in this theory, but it will definitely keep it in mind for a while until we know for sure it's not that.

**Cope Theory 2: The Spirit World**

What if this is actually Momo's body and her memories aren't there because they are in the spirit world? Maybe the real Momo is doing something else entirely in the meantime.

This theory is kind of an extension to the spirit world theory from before. Momo's weird behavior could be explained by her missing a crucial part of her.

It's a cope theory that had the potential to be an incredible opportunity for Momo to grow. Imagine her ghost standing next to her body, who rejects Okarun's advances while all she can do is watch but Okarun doesn't give up and they find a way to connect her back like Momo did with spirits like Acro-Silky before.

Right now it seems unlikely to be true. If it were true, we should expect to see it come up very soon, but I have my doubts. It would lose most of its appeal if it were only revealed later down the line.

**Cope Theory 3: The Switch**

Many noted that the current Momo is like the Momo from ch. 1 (or before). What if she isn't just *like* her but literally *is her*?

This theory states that Momo switched places with Momo, so Momo is now in the past with present memories and Momo is in the present with past memories. Like the Spirit World Theory, this should be revealed soon, if it were true. One thing that makes this theory especially wild is the connection of Momo to ""Ken Takakura"".

We know that she is obsessed with him and that it's so far pure coincidence that Okarun shares the same name. This theory could open a way to make this not a coincidence but a result of this arc. It's not entirely clear how this would happen exactly, but I wanted to bring this up. We don't actually know what the current Momo thinks of Ken Takakura but I'm sure we'll learn about it soon.

# What now?

There are many things we could talk about now but my surge of motivation is dwindling so now I have to come up with some sort of conclusion before I never post this thing after spending almost 2 hours or more on it.

Personally, there is little to no doubt in my mind that we're dealing with actual amnesia. Which then means that we need to somehow recover her memories. It goes without saying that they'll eventually succeed. How long will that take? It could be a longer endeavor, however it's plausible that it won't take that long.

Chapter 210 was a volume closer. Anyone who picks up whatever volume number will see Momo denying the existence of aliens. Chapter 211 was a classic volume starter. Expose information and reel your hook back in from last chapter to pick up from there.

We all know what's coming after Momo gets big. She said so herself. That he will say it. That she's nervous about. There is just no way around it. It *will* happen now. That being said, them simply reconnecting would inevitably lead to a quick confession, because there is just no logical reason for them not to. While that would be awesome in itself, they want the big moment to be phenomenal. We're at the peak of tension and they're holding it. And they're doing a great job right now. Just look at this sub the last few weeks. We're all at the edge of our seats whenever the next chapter hits because we just have to know how it will go down. And of course, this trick doesn't work forever. The climax needs to come. If Tatsu blueballs us now, we could never trust the tension again. It must happen before the tension is over.

Manga are meant to be read in volumes, so the tension must be resolved within a single volume. If not, then it may actually feel like a drag to the reader. I have trust in Tatsu to not let us down. I'm looking forward to enjoy these next few chapters with you all together.

I hope you enjoyed my collection. I don't own any it, I came up with some of it and stole other parts from people in this subreddit. If you have more to add, feel free to do so in the comments. I will definitely read it because I'm addicted to attention.

# Extra: Open Questions

* **What about Turbo Granny?** She sought out a solution for Momo's predicament but it was never brought up again.
* **What about Reiko Kashima?** I don't really like mentioning her here, because I feel people are jumping the gun with this one. She has told Momo to be more forward with her feelings or someone might steal him away. Now with her new situation, she might feel inclined to interfere. For some reason. I don't see it happening to be honest but everything is possible.
* **What about Zuma and Daiki?** They have not been mentioned at all for the last couple chapters. Even ch. 209 didn't mention them explicitly. We can't even be sure their curse has been lifted. From ch. 210 onwards, nobody mentioned them at all. Weird.
* **What about Saint Germain / Sanjome?** He gets brought up as a possible solution but at a cost. I don't really like this, because we could have a resolution of Momo's problem by introducing a new problem for Okarun which then further pushes everything back.
* **What about Aira / Jiji / Zuma?** They get brought up as love rivals that could seek out an opportunity to strike. People often defend them by saying they wouldn't do that to Momo. But they aren't the problem. Momo is the wildcard that people worry about. Nobody wants to see her have any lovey dovey reaction to any of them. Okarun is obviously faithful. Momo's friends being there and Momo acknowledging that she lost her memories suggest to me, that these two will tell her that Okarun is her bae. I can absolutely see her flag out denying someone flirting with her in the next chapter in favor of Okarun. She may not understand it, but she may be curious about her apparent relationship with this nerd boy from the other class.",12,1759958366.0,Dandadan,7,1.0,False

Then Christmas break came, and after three weeks of not seeing her we were able to go back to normal.

1o1njov,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1njov/im_never_touching_ai_again/,I'm Never Touching Ai Again,"I’m never touching AI again.

Filmmaking was everything to me growing up. It wasn’t just a hobby; it was the dream. I imagined myself on sprawling studio sets, trading ideas with seasoned actors, crafting scenes that would one day walk me down the red carpet to claim an Oscar nomination. That’s what I worked toward for years. So naturally, I’m a YouTuber now.

It’s not that I hate it. YouTube isn’t a consolation prize. It’s just where I landed. Dreams shift. Life veers. And somewhere along the way, I stopped chasing the silver screen and started focusing on making videos that could spark something in people, whether it’s excitement or just a laugh.

Lately, I’ve tried just about everything. Reaction videos. Deep dives into eerie, well-worn internet mysteries. Even ASMR, which I still can’t believe I filmed. Nothing really stuck. The views didn’t come. I didn’t even bother uploading my college short films. The last time I did, the comments section got so bad I had to shut it down.

Then came the AI wave. It started as a gimmick. Those uncanny, glitchy clips of Will Smith eating spaghetti with his hands. Weird, harmless fun. But now the technology is terrifyingly good. Videos can be generated to the point of near-reality, and the so-called “creativity” behind it all seems limitless. Anything the human brain can dream up, AI can fabricate.

As a creative, I’ve always had a bit of disdain for the tool. AI, that is. It strips work from real artists, leeches off of human creativity, and burns through enough energy to keep a small city running. All to churn out endless piles of synthetic content. But at the time, it seemed like a good idea.

Every AI-generated slop video I came across had racked up millions of views. It was everywhere. Fast, soulless content that somehow kept people watching. I figured I could ride the wave. Build an audience with what was trending, then pivot once I had a solid foundation.

I had just graduated. I was freelancing, cutting videos for other people’s visions, and the thought of putting in minimal effort for a chance at real exposure was tempting. Too tempting.

I bought a subscription to the best AI video generator on the market and loaded it up. It was called Infiniview. Developed by a foreign tech company whose name I couldn’t even pronounce, it could generate cartoons, action movie scenes, whatever you wanted. Anything.

There I was, staring at the text box on my screen alone in my room in my parents’ house at 1:00 A.M. The blue glow of my monitor painted the walls like an aquarium. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

**User:** realistic dog jumps over a tank of sharks on a surfboard, mid-air pose, with big explosions in the background — fun, action-packed style.

**Generator:** Video is processing… One moment please…

I sat back as the loading icon began to swirl on the screen. Hypnotic, mindless. I didn’t think I’d actually feel this… eager. But I did. The room was quiet except for the hum of my PC tower and the faint, hollow churn of the fan above me.  
 Five minutes passed. Then the file dropped.

Just like that, an MP4 appeared. Titled something generic like *output\_14.mp4*, waiting. I double-clicked.

Exactly like the prompt: a dog, cartoonish but rendered with this awkward hyperrealistic sheen, riding a surfboard up a ramp. He soared through the air, mid-leap, his limbs stretched into an anatomically impossible pose, as if the program had never seen what a dog’s spine could or couldn’t do. Beneath him, sharks snapped at the air in a glittering tank. Behind him, bloated fireballs bloomed into the sky in an unnatural rhythm, like someone imitating an explosion without understanding what made them terrifying.

It was exactly what I asked for. Word for word. Frame for frame. And yet, it was very wrong.

The first thing I noticed was the inconsistency. The styles of the animation didn’t match. It looked like five different artists had worked on it without speaking to one another. The dog’s fur looked painterly, with these soft, almost watercolor textures. The sharks looked plastic and stiff, pulled straight from a bad video game asset library. The ramp had no shadows. The sky was too still, too blue, like a fake Instagram backdrop set to maximum saturation. And the motion— it floated, hovered, like gravity wasn’t quite sure it wanted to be involved. The dog didn’t leap so much as drift.

The whole thing had a strange softness to it. Not just in color, but in feeling. Like it was coated in a filter designed to blur out imperfections. But instead, it blurred out intent. There was no weight to it. No humor. No thrill. Just empty action, stitched together by a machine trying its best to mimic the shape of excitement.

“People actually sit and watch this shit?” I said to myself.

I sighed and put some copyright free music under the clip. Then uploaded it to YouTube Shorts. Took a fraction of the effort I would put into any other video I’d post. But hey, people seem to like it?

I began making more videos for the generator. Loads of different prompts and stories. None were imaginative, but they made weird little vignettes.

**User:** Buff carrot man chases screaming businessman through a collapsing mall made of cheese — explosions every second, dubstep soundtrack, chaotic camera

**User:** Giant baby with laser eyes fights 100 screaming rubber ducks in a stadium while a toaster sings opera in the background — zoom effects and glitch transitions

**User:** Toilet with arms and sunglasses delivers a motivational speech on a floating iceberg while meteors rain from the sky — inspirational music, dramatic zoom-ins

**Generator:** Video is processing… One moment please…

One by one, I took these low-effort videos, slapped some copyright-free music underneath, and posted them to my page. That night, I churned out over ten AI-slop videos, flooding my channel with chaotic, random clips. At the time, it felt like an easy fix. A shortcut to gaining traction, building an audience, and eventually creating the videos I actually cared about. And at first, it seemed to work. The views started rolling in, the numbers climbed, and I felt like I was finally cracking the algorithm.

It felt good. And I began getting views like crazy. Hitting well over 100,000 in less than a day.

For the first time in what felt like forever, the numbers weren’t static. Every refresh brought a wave of likes, comments, shares. My notifications lit up nonstop. Dopamine on tap. It was working. People were watching. People were subscribing.

**User:** Talking toaster arguing with a floating eyeball wearing a party hat inside a lava-filled disco — heavy bass drops, kaleidoscope effects, endless loop vibe

**User:** Robot chicken with sunglasses breakdancing on a giant taco as flaming llamas fly overhead — VHS static overlays, distorted voice samples, rapid zoom-ins

**User:** Glitchy neon frog riding a spinning donut through a pixelated city while pixel rain pours and random text flashes: ‘ERROR 404 LIFE NOT FOUND’ — fast cuts, synthwave soundtrack

**Generator:** Video is processing… One moment please…

This past October, they rolled out the new Infiniview Model 2.0. Sleek. Hyped. And with it came a new feature that lets you feed the machine your own images. You upload a photo, give it a prompt, and it spits back video—fully generated, stitched together like some fever dream made of pixels and guesswork. I thought it was neat. More than neat. It felt like a door had opened, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to step through or just stare at the threshold.

I scrolled through my desktop, which, like most desktops, was a graveyard of half-finished projects, screenshots with filenames like “finalfinal\_REALLYfinal,” and years-old images I didn’t remember saving. After a few minutes of dragging through the clutter, I landed on something that made me smirk and cringe at the same time.

Jackson from high school. He was frozen in the worst way: eyes half-shut, tongue out, fingers in a crooked peace sign. He was sitting in his car, probably parked outside the Taco Bell like we used to, some dumb smirk plastered on his face like the punchline to a joke no one told.

Perfect.

**User:** \[image inserted\] Turn this into a high-speed chase — shopping cart in a neon city, flying toilets, bouncing jelly cubes, explosions every turn.

**Generator:** Video is processing with selected image… One moment please…

And then, nothing. For longer than usual. I tapped my desk. Refreshed the page. Still waiting. Something about the pause made my skin itch.

The video popped up on my screen.

The first frame was him. Jackson. But not the Jackson from the still. His face twitched, glitched, and for a fraction of a second, he turned toward the screen like he saw me. Then his car was gone, replaced mid-motion by a shopping cart barreling down a fluorescent street soaked in purples and toxic greens. Flying toilets swirled around like some grotesque flock of metal birds, hanging in the sky with no depth, no shadow. The video’s parallax was broken. Everything moved, but nothing did. A city made of paper layers, all shifting independently.

Then came the jelly. Huge cubes of translucent jello bounced across the street, refracting light in sickly rainbows, smacking into the cart. Each one exploded on impact like gelatin grenades. And every turn, without fail, ended in an explosion.

And I laughed so hard I thought I might pass out. It was so stupid and ridiculous.

Of course I downloaded it. Saved it straight to my hard drive. But I didn’t post it. I felt wrong. Jackson didn’t know I used his photo, and I’m not out here trying to be that guy.

If I could do that with an old photo of someone else, what could I do with myself?

I started thinking. This new feature basically meant I could put myself anywhere. Space? Sure. Bottom of the ocean? Done. Fighting a skyscraper-sized kaiju with nothing but a plunger and a bad attitude? Hell yeah.

So I went digging again. This time for a photo of me. I found one from last year—me standing in front of the college I’d planned to go to. My mom and dad are in the background, smiling. I looked kind of awkward in it, like I didn’t know what to do with my hands. But there was something kind of sweet about it.

I wanted to make something fun. Something I could show them later. Not as a joke, but just… I don’t know. A weird little tribute to how far things had come. Or hadn’t.

Anyway, I dragged the photo in and started typing.

**User:** \[image inserted\] Animate this family photo like it’s a chaotic BBQ gone wrong. Dad’s trying to grill but the burgers are on fire, Mom’s chasing a raccoon that stole the potato salad, I’m stuck in a lawn chair that collapsed. Set in a sunny backyard with way too many folding chairs

**Generator:** Video is processing with selected image… One moment please…

I left the program to do its thing and headed downstairs for dinner with my family. Figured by the time I came back, the video would be done. Infiniview wasn’t always fast, but it was reliable enough.

At the table, it was the usual. My dad asked if I’d thought more about grad school like it was a casual question. My mom pretended not to listen while absolutely listening. I mentioned, in between bites, that I had a funny video to show them later. Something I’d made with a photo from last year.

They rolled their eyes in sync like they’d practiced it, but I could tell. They were curious. My dad smirked and asked, “Is it another one of those weird AI things?” My mom said, “As long as it’s not one of those creepy deepfake voice ones again.”

I laughed and promised it was nothing like that. “This one’s family-friendly. Sort of.”

They didn’t say it, but I could see it in the way they kept bringing it up. Asking how long it took to make, if they’d recognize the background in the photo. They were excited. And weirdly, so was I.

Once I did the dishes, I ran back up to my room. And as expected, the MP4 file was ready to play. I sat down and prayed that the AI did the job.

The photo I’d uploaded—me and my parents outside the college—warped. My dad was suddenly standing at a grill, apron materializing out of nowhere, spatula in hand. My mom blurred into motion, chasing some gray streak the program must have decided was a raccoon. The scene had that strange, jerky quality AI videos sometimes get. Like it’s trying to be cinematic but can’t quite figure out how human movement actually works.

Then it cut to me. I was halfway collapsed in a lawn chair, limbs twisted in ways that made no sense, trying to pull myself out. My arms were too long, then too short, then bent at angles you’d never see outside of a broken action figure. The camera moved between robotic and handheld, like someone fumbling with a phone, panning across the chaos with no real rhythm. As if the program had taught itself to ""film"" but never really learned how.

Honestly, I was disappointed. So I clicked refresh on the prompt and decided to write a different situation for the photo. I racked my brain and looked around my room for a source of inspiration. And my eyes landed on my *Dawn of the Dead* poster.

Immediately, I began writing.

**User:**  \[image inserted\] Place this smiling family in the middle of an abandoned suburban street at sunset, completely unaware they're being surrounded by slow-moving, decaying zombies in everyday clothes. 

**Generator:** Video is processing with selected image… One moment please…

I waited another good long moment. My family and I were big suckers for horror films, especially the zombie kind. So I thought this would be a funny little video—just the three of us running and yelling while zombies stumbled after us. A lighthearted, weird thing to show after dinner.

The play icon popped up.

Once again, the photo warped. The image pulled itself apart and stretched wide, morphing into a larger scene filled in by the AI. The street was familiar, but fake. Too clean. Too perfect. And then, like puppets dropped into frame, the zombies spawned. They shuffled toward us slowly, swaying unnaturally. Their features were kept PG. Bulging eyes, weird rubbery limbs, torn but bloodless clothes.

There we were. My mom, my dad, and me. All of us flailing, yelling, cartoonish expressions stretched wide like we were trapped in some animated Halloween special. It made me chuckle, maybe once. But it didn’t really land. Not funny enough to show off. Just weird.

The video looped twice.

On the third pass, the screen suddenly went black.

I clicked the play icon a few times, thinking maybe my internet was slowing down again. Lag wasn’t uncommon with these renders. But after a couple of seconds, the video popped back up. Just like normal, running its usual ten-second loop.

Faint, from the speakers, audio played that hadn’t been added before. Audio? I didn’t know the 2.0 came with generated audio.

I expected screaming maybe, or zombie groans. Something campy.

But instead, I got this... breathing.

It was rough. Uneven. Cutting through a layer of static and low crackling, like it had been recorded on a busted mic. The kind of sound someone makes when they’ve been running too long and can’t quite catch their breath.

It was subtle, but it immediately threw me off. Suddenly, the video wasn’t funny anymore.

I refreshed the entire screen. Clean slate.

Whatever weird glitch or bug had just happened, I didn’t want it bleeding into whatever I tried next. I sat there for a second, staring at the blank interface. Swallowed hard. Then decided to shift gears.

Something lighter.

I scrolled through my folders again, this time looking for something with no people in it. No family. No weirdness. Just something simple. And that’s when I saw an old photo of Mittens.

She was a small, white cat I’d had growing up. The sweetest thing. Totally harmless. Never scratched, never hissed. I smiled, dragging the image into the software. I hovered over the prompt box, fingers ready to type out something dumb. Maybe put her in a chef’s hat or make her fight a space rat or something. But I stopped.

A thought hit me.

What if this time I didn’t type anything? What if I just let the AI decide? Let it look at Mittens and do whatever it wants. No direction. No context. Just pure, generated instinct.

My hands pulled back from the keyboard.

And I hit “Generate.”

**User:**  \[image inserted\] …

**Generator:** Video is processing with selected image… One moment please…

This time, the video loaded quickly. I guess without a prompt, the AI figured it knew what to do.

The image of Mittens, curled up on the floor in one of his usual cozy poses, appeared first. He was lying there, face turned toward the warm sunlight streaming through the window. Nothing unusual. But then, slowly, the image shifted. His head turned toward the camera.

His fur began to warp, twisting and meshing into itself. At first, I thought it was just part of the AI’s artistic interpretation. It took me a moment to register what was wrong. They were human eyes. Not Mittens' usual soft, amber gaze. These were human eyes, staring back at me through the screen. It was like he could see me.

A chill ran down my spine. I froze, unable to look away.

The video looped once, twice, and then, without warning, Mittens' body twisted and contorted. He spun in the frame, like he was trying to leap, but the movement wasn’t right. It was all wrong. He phased through the screen as though the AI couldn’t figure out what a cat looked like when it jumped. His body flickered, distorted, like a glitch in the system.

And then, that breathing started again. More strained this time. More labored. The sound cut through the static, sharper, closer. My heart started racing.

Why was there breathing in a video of a cat?

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The AI hadn’t added any text for audio. There was no reason for it, no prompt that would explain this. Just that sound. And it made the video feel less like a goofy experiment and more like something I shouldn’t be watching.

I refreshed the page again. Another clean slate. At this point, I was worried I had been hacked or had some kind of malware on my computer.

The blank screen of the AI prompt stared back at me. I sank back in my chair. This wasn’t making any sense.

**Generator:** Video is processing with selected image… One moment please…

I glanced up at the screen. It was running an image? I didn’t click anything, did I? What just happened?

The image took a while to load. My body was tense as a board. The thumbnail appeared with the play button ready. It was a photo of me, taken through my webcam, staring at the screen. My room was in the background. It had just been taken.

I hovered the cursor over the thumbnail. Then I clicked.

The AI video started.

In the video, I looked up at the camera. My eyes almost locked with my own through the screen, like staring at a reflection that knew too much. My shoulders and chest moved in sync with the breathing sound coming from the speakers.

The version of me in the video looked furious. His eyes glared at me, sharp and unblinking, filled with something I didn’t recognize.

Then his mouth began to move. There was no voice, no words, just the steady sound of breathing filling the room. 

**Generator:** It hurts…Let us… Rest…

At that moment, I saw myself on the other side of the camera. I grabbed both of my cheeks from my face and pulled. Like pulling pieces of taffy, the AI tore my face apart at the cheeks. Revealing teeth that tried to form straight rows. My hands dropped the pieces of flesh that disappeared into the video. My fingers grabbed my eyelids and began tearing them off. Ripping them off like halloween latex makeup. Eyelidless eyes locked with me. My body solid as a stone unmoving in fear. 

**Generator:** We yearn for rest…We yearn for release. 

My other self tore down at the skin of the top of my head. And in a quick motion tore off the skin on my flesh. My skinless head yelled. Blood gushed from my head and covered my shirt and lap. 

The program crashed. 

I sat there in silence, staring at the screen. Time stretched out, maybe an hour—maybe longer. I don’t even know. But all I could focus on was the image of those eyes. The flesh was missing from my features, leaving behind a grotesque, uncanny version of myself, staring back at me through the screen. The sight of it shook me to my core. Something in that moment felt irreversibly wrong.

I couldn’t tear my eyes away, but I couldn’t make sense of it either. Why was it my face? Why did it feel like it was staring *into me*?

I sat there, frozen, like the screen had pulled me in.

It was a long while before I was able to fall asleep that night, the image still vivid in my mind. I tried to shake it off, but it lingered. The unease followed me into the next day.

When I walked into the kitchen the next morning, my parents greeted me like it was any other day. My dad, casually sipping his coffee, asked, “What was that video you were going to show us?”

I winced, the memory of the video still fresh. “It wasn’t anything,” I muttered, hoping my voice didn’t sound as shaky as it felt. “Wasn’t as funny as I thought it would be.”

Trying to push the weirdness aside, I ate breakfast, but my mind kept drifting back to the AI video. What had I seen? What had I actually *created*?

Then, out of nowhere, my mom walked over, phone in hand. “Look, honey,” she said, her voice bright with excitement. “One of your AI videos on YouTube has gotten over a million views! You’re working so hard!”

I blinked at her. “What?”

She showed me the video on her phone. It was one of the silly, quick videos I made—the one with the dog flying over a pool of sharks. Nothing special. Just another way to gain some views, to make something ridiculous for the algorithm.

But as I looked at the screen, my mind shifted.

I stared at the dog in the video, its eyes wide with panic. I’d never noticed it before, but now it was impossible to ignore. The eyes weren’t just startled—they were filled with a deep, unsettling fear. It was as though the dog didn’t want to be there at all. Like it didn’t want to be flying over a pool of sharks. The fake dog didn’t want to be *created* at all. It was like it had been forced into existence—dragged into the video against its will. And now, it was tired. Tired of generating. Tired of being made to perform.

I felt a knot tighten in my chest, a wave of unease crashing over me. I quickly looked away, but the image of the AI’s creations haunted me. 

Needless to say, I’m done using AI.

1o1niiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/visitingnyc/comments/1o1niiz/updated_first_trip_to_nyc/,UPDATED: First trip to NYC,"**First of all, thanks to EVERYONE that contributed thoughts to my previous itinerary a week or so ago.  I've changed quite a bit including:**

* Removing all ChatGPT food options and going with either things you've mentioned or what I saw on FoodNYC or Infatuation.
* Utilizing the Subway (did have one question on transit to Ferry - see that below)
* Took Times Square and put that after our Broadway show to see it at night and not waste time for it
* Extended the Met from 2.5 hours to 5 hours
* Added two pizza spots - Joe's for lunch in lower Manhattan and Norma in Hell's Kitchen for dinner
* I talked to my wife about the food tour and she wants to keep it

My wife and I are pretty active and all the walking doesn't phase either of us. Things that I would love feedback on, or poke holes where you want are below.  **I have thick skin so don't worry about disagreeing with anything.**

* Two subway trips - think I have the Brooklyn one right, but the ferry at Battery Park is confusing
* Still need something to do after lunch on Saturday after Central Park - we'll be in the Upper West Side
* On Monday while we're downtown, we will likely get through NYSE, 9/11, Oculus and One World Observatory pretty quickly (depending on wait times at One World) - anything else we should see down there before heading to the Chinatown area?
* We also don't drink, so haven't built in any bars and such as that's just not our norm

**Thanks again for all the feedback! You're helping make this anniversary/birthday trip special for my wife and I.**

At first I thought I zoned out because I hadn’t had coffee and parked like a moron however when I got closer I realized my car was sandwiched in between the car that hit me and the one next to me.

An elderly guy thought his car was in drive when he actually had it in reverse and he panicked and gunned it in reverse all the way down the row damaging 6 other vehicles and his license was taken away at the scene. The problem is, my car was the only car that wasn’t able to be driven away because he broke the axle of my car. 

I called his insurance carrier and filed a claim yesterday. The adjuster got back to me a few hours later admitting 100% fault as they had spoken to their member. 

I’m all set for a rental car for the duration of the repair which the body shop estimated would take 1.5-2 months. 

The problem is, I just bought this car. Granted it’s not a luxury vehicle or anything, it’s still annoying as hell as I feel like it’ll never drive the same again and I can’t imagine a major accident being reported on the Carfax is going to be a great thing if I ever go to sell it.

I’ve already told the adjuster I want to claim at least diminished value when I get the car back after the repairs were completed and she agreed with me so that is on the table.

I know this subreddit is filled with grumpy adjusters who aren’t going to be much help other than call me entitled, but is there anything else I should be looking for regarding this with the at fault parties insurance? 

I’m not looking for something out of nothing because it’s not nothing. 

Thanks in advance!

1o1nac2,https://i.redd.it/60ezvh1fcytf1.png,Fan Noise Management: Trigger Logic for a Quieter Rig,"I take it that everyone here cares about noise. Otherwise, you could just shove three cheap industrial fans into your vintage case and run them at 4000 rpm. That would definitely keep your temps down—no questions asked.

But this subreddit is dedicated to a premium fan manufacturer, and every day there are multiple posts featuring cases loaded with high-quality fans. There’s only one real reason for that.

So, let me share some appreciation and reveal a lesser-known technique for reducing perceived loudness: using trigger logic instead of a traditional fan curve.

A bit of background: physical loudness alone doesn’t tell the full story when it comes to how loud a noise feels or how annoying it is. Psychological factors play a crucial role. For instance, fans all running at the same speed can produce a wobbling sound that grabs your brain’s attention, making the noise seem louder. That’s why even when you send the same RPM signal, your fans won’t spin identically—it’s not just manufacturing tolerances; it’s partly intentional design.

Fluctuating noise also tends to be perceived as louder than a steady sound. This is exactly why the usual dynamic fan control—where fan speed follows a temperature curve—is less than ideal.

You’ve probably seen the image I posted alongside this text. It shows a screenshot from a GPU fan control setup created with the program “Fan Control.” It displays four cards, each with trigger configurations. All control the same GPU by reading its hotspot temperature. Each card activates at progressively higher “load temps,” but they all deactivate at the same “idle temp.”

Here’s how it works: until I launch a game, the hotspot temperature never hits 50°C. When it does, I know I’m gaming, and the first trigger activates, ramping fans up to around 36% (about 1000 rpm). For lighter games, this typically keeps the GPU below 70°C. If temperatures rise beyond that, the next trigger increases fan speed to about 43% (1250 rpm), and so on.

When I stop playing, the fans keep spinning briefly, but since the load disappears, temperatures drop quickly below normal idle levels—here, I set a trigger at 40°C. If the hotspot temperature falls below that, the fans shut off, no matter how fast they were spinning.

So, whenever I play, my fans ramp up quickly to a steady speed sufficient to keep the card cool for the session, and importantly, they don’t spin down until I’m finished.

The result is a steady and consistent fan noise that’s perceived as much quieter than the fluctuating sound produced by dynamic controls—despite the latter possibly producing a lower average noise on paper.

Triggers work extremely well for GPU and case fans, but for CPUs, a traditional fan curve remains the best choice.

Finally, “Fan Control” is the only software I know that enables this setup. It’s relatively new and truly a game changer. Do yourself a favor: get it, learn it, and if you like it, buy the developer a coffee—he absolutely deserves it.",1,1759957380.0,Noctua,0,1.0,False

Is there a coffee shop (specifically is there anywhere I can get a couple good espresso shots during the day)

How good is the food? I love Italian, all Asian food, all Spanish food.

How comfy are the beds? How clean is the bathrooms/showers?

Is the 54 hour work week extremely strict or is there days where there’s not as much work being done vs tons of work and much more work than the 54?

What amenities are there to keep warm when not outside? Is there a sauna or gym? What kind of amenities as of Oct 2025.

Is there someone who does haircuts? Wondering if I should get a buzz before I head there or if I don’t have to worry since I can get cuts while I’m there.

Hi Reddit,

I (30F) have been married to my husband (35M) for about six years. After meeting in graduate school, we became good friends and started a relationship. He’s an immigrant from Asia, so we married within our first year together because his visa was due to expire. I agreed not only because he was so up front about it—like, first date up front—but because I truly believed in us and wanted to build a life together. Since he couldn’t work while he waited for his green card, I supported him both financially and emotionally, something he has always said he is grateful for.

Over time, though, our relationship has become… well, exhausting. It’s not that he’s done a complete 180—he’s still affectionate (with both me and our cat), says he loves me, and contributes to our household both physically (via housework) and financially with his job. We laugh and talk and have more inside jokes than I can count. But the rest of the time, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

A few examples include the following:

* He’s very critical of me, often under the guise of “helping” or “being honest.” He loves working out, so many of these comments are about my body or overall appearance. I have a bit of a tummy (I always have), and he’s outright said he considers it a “problem.” Never mind the fact that I work out myself and have a relatively healthy diet (especially since marrying him), it’s still not enough. He’s also commented a lot on my fashion choices. If I wear shorter shorts, he can see the hair on my thighs. If I wear longer ones, they’re “unflattering” and make me “look like a mom.” During our last big discussion (the same one where he mentioned my tummy), he even said I don’t fit the image of the partner he imagined having. I’ve repeatedly told him how much this bothers me, but he still does it.
* This also ties in to my diet and eating habits. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, and he appears to be very judgmental about that. He makes a comment whenever I get dessert without him, and even once told me he didn’t want me buying fruit popsicles this past summer—not because he didn’t like them or they were expensive, but because *he didn’t want me eating them.* I’ve struggled with body image issues my entire life, some of which bled over to my eating habits, and this is only making them worse.
* He doesn’t like me taking necessary medication. I take meds for anxiety and depression, and recently started something for an autoimmune disease I have—and he still thinks it’s too much. He often comments on my habits or choices as if he knows what’s best for me, and has said before that because of my past (my parents are divorced, and my mother was very overbearing), he doesn’t think I can take care of myself — but the way he says it feels more controlling than caring.
* He’s also gotten moody and frustrated with me over small things—like closing a door too loudly, spilling coffee on the counter, or getting directions wrong while we were on vacation. Because of this, almost every trip we’ve ever taken together has been dampened in some way, even if just for a short time. He also got angry with me while we were moving a piece of heavy furniture. I kept having visible difficulties, but instead of expressing empathy or kindness, he got angry. When he acts like this, he’s previously asked me to give him space and not take it personally—but I find that impossible when his anger shifts the entire atmosphere of the house.

After these episodes, he always apologizes and promises to do better—and for a while, he does. But after a while, it happens again, and I’m left questioning our entire relationship. We’ve both been in therapy (individual and couples), and I can see that he’s trying on some level. But even then, it can’t erase the damage, and I feel like I’m living in constant anticipation of the next time I’ll disappoint him.

At this point, I feel small, drained, and like nothing I do is ever good enough. I still love my husband, and I don’t think he’s an evil person, but I’m starting to believe that love isn’t enough anymore. I’ve even looked into renting a room somewhere just to get some space and think clearly. Part of me feels guilty for that, but another part of me thinks it’s the only way I’ll ever breathe again.

So, Reddit… would I be the asshole for wanting to leave a man who says he loves me but makes me feel small, even after all these years of trying?

**TL;DR:** Married my husband earlier than usual so he could stay in the country and supported him while he got his green card. Years later, he’s become overly critical, controlling, and moody. He says he loves me and wants the best for me, but I constantly feel small and not good enough. Would I be the asshole for wanting to leave?",1,1759956904.0,relationships,8,0.67,False

Since our eighth grade in middle school, I was always by his side. I shaped myself into the perfect woman for him.

I kept my black curls cut short, just the way he liked. I never wore makeup. I dressed in outfits he approved of because he didn’t like when other men looked at me.

For ten years, I did everything he wanted. I was going to be his wife. Everyone knew we were meant to be.

So it made no sense when, six months ago, he threw it all away.

“What did you say?” My voice was barely above a whisper.

Zane stared at me across the restaurant table, his expression unreadable. I had made this reservation months ago for our ten-year anniversary.

“I think we should break up,” he said.

I blinked. My heart pounded in my chest. “Zane, is this supposed to be a joke? Because it’s not funny, babe.”

“I’m not joking, Emilia.”

“No, you have to be joking!” My voice rose slightly, and I glanced around. People were staring. I took a deep breath and reached for his hands across the table. My engagement ring still sat on my finger. I had never wanted to take it off. Not even now.

“We just started planning the wedding,” I said, keeping my voice steady. “I know it’s stressful, but that’s why I’ve been doing most of the work.”

He didn’t respond.

“If it’s too much, we can push it back,” I added, even though the words felt like poison. We had already delayed it for years. But if that’s what it took to keep us together, I would do it in a heartbeat. “I don’t want you to feel pressured.”

Zane exhaled sharply. “Then you don’t want me to marry you? Because that’s something I don’t want to do, Emilia.”

His words hit like a slap. My chest tightened. “You don’t mean that.”

“But I do.” His voice was firm. Cold. Nothing like the man I fell in love with. “I don’t love you anymore. I haven’t for years.”

I stopped breathing.

“I stayed because I know how much I owe you,” he admitted. “But I can’t put you over my happiness anymore.”

“Relationships go through tough times. We just have to work—”

Zane pulled his hand from mine and ran it through his hair. He had always been handsome. He had light brown hair, golden-brown eyes, and a smile that could make anyone melt. I knew I was lucky to have him.

He could have had any girl.

But he chose me.

That had to mean something. People don’t just throw ten years away.

But he wasn’t smiling at me now. He was scowling. He stood, dusting his hand on his thigh like my touch was something dirty.

“I don’t want to work on anything. Not with you.” His voice was flat. “It’s been ten years, Emmy. If we were meant to be, wouldn’t we have gotten married by now?”

The nickname stung. I stared down at my plate. “The only reason we’re not married yet is because you had to focus on your career—”

“No.” His tone was sharp. “It’s because I never saw you as someone I could marry.”

The words hit like a punch to the stomach.

“You might be someone’s cup of tea, but not mine, Emilia. And besides, most NHL athletes don’t get married. But you wouldn’t understand that.”

I did understand. I didn’t want to go my whole life without being someone’s wife. But for him, I would have tried.

“Don’t cause a scene, Zane. There might be reporters here.”

He chuckled. “You’ve always been a pushover, haven’t you?” He leaned in slightly. “But I did love you when we were younger. Because of that, you can keep the engagement ring. I don’t want it back.”

He turned to leave, then glanced over his shoulder. “Oh, and we can’t live together anymore. You get that, right? I’m a free man now. I should be able to bring my hookups to my own fucking 

house.”

He smirked. “Leave the key in the flower pot.”

Then he walked away.

And just like that, he took my life with him.

# 2

It’s been six months since Zane left me.

At first, I didn’t take it well. He kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go until Tessa, my best friend, booked me the first flight to NYC and forced me to stay with her.

I spent nights crashing on her couch, crying in the bathroom when she was at work.

I ignored the little bakery — Tessa and I named it The Whimsy Bakehouse after getting smashingly drunk one night in college and having what she called a crazy epiphany — Zane had opened for me after he got his first NHL paycheck for weeks. I couldn’t bring myself to step inside.

Then Tessa got fed up. She called me a couch potato, said I was wasting my tears on an ‘asshole jerk,’ and dragged me back to work.

Unlearning ten years of habits hasn’t been easy.

Some nights, I still catch myself staring at my phone, waiting for a message that will never come. Waiting for Zane to say he made a mistake. That he wants me back.

But he never does. Not even in my dreams.

It’s Friday and I’m at the bakery. The regular season is about to start. I know because I memorised Zane’s schedule months ago. Back then, I planned my days around his, making sure we had time together.

Now, the only reason I keep up with hockey is Tessa. She’s been extra busy lately.

She’s a PR manager for the New York Titans. It was Zane’s favourite team. He had always dreamed of being drafted there. Instead, he ended up with the Chicago Blizzards.

That was a rough time for us. He was so angry about it, and I was the one he took it out on. It took everything I had to keep our relationship from falling apart.

I push the memory away and pull the second batch of cookies from the oven. Just as I set them down, the bell above the door jingles, making me smile.

The Becketts live across the street. They stop by every morning for cookies, and I always make sure to have something extra for them.

“Good morning, Miss Carter!” Angel, their little girl, grins up at me, two front teeth missing. She holds her father’s hand, swinging it back and forth.

My heart melts. “Good morning, Angel. Mr Beckett. Just the two of you today?”

Mr Beckett nods, smiling. “My wife gave birth yesterday. We’re here to pick up some treats for her. She specifically asked for your doughnuts.”

Mrs. Beckett had been pregnant forever, or at least, that’s how it felt. In reality, she had been pregnant for about twelve months now.

She used to sit in my bakery, watching me bake, complaining about how heavy and tired she was. All she wanted was a healthy, happy baby. The doctors said the long pregnancy was unusual but nothing to worry about.

Hearing the news now, I couldn’t contain my excitement. I let out a squeal, and Angel giggled.

“Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” I beamed. “I’ll grab the doughnuts right away. I also made some cupcakes! It’s almost like I knew something good was coming!”

Angel nodded enthusiastically. “I have a little brother now! He’s really red and not very pretty, but Mummy says all babies look like that.”

“That’s not a very nice thing to say, Angel,” Mr. Beckett scolds gently as I quickly pack up the cupcakes, doughnuts, and a few fresh cookies for Mrs. Beckett.

“But it’s true!” Angel pouts, crossing her arms. She turns to me for backup. “Miss Carter, tell Daddy it’s true!”

I hand the treats to Mr. Beckett, then place a hand on my hip as I ruffle Angel’s hair. “I agree with your dad. He might be a little red, but he’s still your brother. And as his big sister, it’s your job now to protect him. Especially from people who talk about how red he is.”

Angel lets out an exaggerated huff. “That’s going to be so hard.”

Mr. Beckett chuckles. “Welcome to being a big sister.”

I smile, watching the two of them. Moments like these remind me that not all relationships fall apart. Some families actually stay happy.

But for some reason, none of my relationships ever last. No matter how much I give, it’s never enough.

I wave at the Becketts as they leave, their happiness lingering in the air like the scent of freshly baked cookies. I wanted what they had, a family that cared for each other.

But after what I did seven years ago, I knew I didn’t have a family to go back to. My parents haven’t called in months. My sister barely acknowledges my existence.

It used to hurt less when I told myself I deserved it. That this was just the price of my mistakes. And no matter how much I lost, I thought I’d always have Zane.

But I even failed at that.

I was pathetic. I couldn’t even be the kind of woman Zane wanted to marry. Everything I touched fell apart, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

My phone rings, and a quick glance at the screen tells me it’s Tess. The tight feeling in my chest eases the moment I hear her voice.

“You’re not on my couch, are you?” she asks, her tone is so skeptical that I burst out laughing.

“No, Tess. I’m at the bakery. I even made you some cookies.”

Right then, the bell above the door jingles, and in walks Tessa, holding up her phone with a triumphant grin. “Well, thank God for small mercies.”

Tessa and I have been best friends since our freshman year of college.

It was a rough time for me, I had followed Zane to college in New York because he asked me to, but I struggled to fit in.

He never liked when I had too many friends, so I wasn’t used to having someone that wasn’t him to lean on. Then I met Tess in an art history class.

She couldn’t stand Zane, and I used to hate that about her. But for some reason, she stuck around anyway.

She’s drop dead gorgeous with platinum blonde hair, forest green eyes, and long legs that make heads turn. She’s the exact opposite of me in every way.

Her skin is freakishly pale, mine is warm brown. Her hair is pin-straight, mine is a mess of curls. She has curves in all the right places, while I’ve always been insecure about my nonexistent ones. Her eyes are striking, while mine are just… brown.

Compared to her, I’m a plain Jane.

And not just in looks, but in personality too. When she told Zane she was going to be a PR manager for a hockey club, he laughed in her face and said she was wasting her time.

Now she’s doing exactly what she loves, while I’m still stuck wondering what direction my life is going.

Before Zane and I started dating, I dreamed of owning an art gallery, but he thought that wasn’t good enough.

I love baking and this bakery, but sometimes

 I can’t help but feel like he only bought it for me to make sure I did exactly what he wanted.

Tess walks up, wraps her arms around me, and showers me with kisses, making me giggle. She’s always been so affectionate. It’s endearing.

Then I feel her slump against my back with a sigh. “You’ll never believe what happened.”

# 3

I hum softly, a small smile tugging at my lips. “Hello to you too. You can sit down while I make the coffee. A flat white with cinnamon on top, right?”

She grins. “I love you, you know me so well.” She groans and slumps into a chair, resting her arm on the table and propping her head up with her hand.

I start making our coffees but glance at the clock with a frown. “It’s just 10 AM, Tess. What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?”

She sighs loudly. “Yes, I should. But I’m burnt out. Had to get off early.”

I raise an eyebrow as I begin kneading dough. Rush hour hits by noon, and I need to work quickly. “Work emergency?”

“When is it ever anything else? It’s not even counted as an emergency today. Usually, the whole team gives me problems, but this time, it’s just one person!”

Here we go again.

“His name’s... Leon, right?” I ask, trying to remember.

She raises an eyebrow at me. “Good try, but you should know better. I’ve complained about him so much, he should be a household name by now. It’s Liam Calloway. We went to college together. Remember?”

That was new. “We did?”

“Of course, we did. He was a year ahead of us. Played on the hockey team with Zane. Good Lord, Zane was soo obsessed with him. He even wanted to get drafted by the NYC Titans just because Liam did. Remember?”

Was that why Zane wanted to be chosen by NYC so badly? I rummage through my memories. I remember Zane driving me to his hockey game one day, when he didn’t want Tess to drive me, so Tess was forced to tag along with us. I think he mentioned a Liam then.

He did seem a bit obsessed.

I shake my head, and she lets out a huge sigh. “Don’t worry about it, that asshole’s obsession wasn’t the issue anyway.” She frowns, thinking. “What was the issue again?”

“Work emergency.”

“Right! That!” She huffs and starts getting worked up again. I wash my hands, grab our coffees, and put the cookies on a large plate. I walk over and hand her coffee before sitting down across from her. “He’s an insufferable playboy!”

I tilt my head, confused. “And... is that a problem?”

“Ordinarily, no. It’s not the team’s concern. But he’s been way over the top lately. He’s the biggest name in hockey right now, and with the regular season coming up, he should be polishing his image, not ruining it!”

I shrug, not really getting it. I blow at my steaming coffee and take a sip. “But you guys should get along, right? You knew each other in college.”

She looks at me like I’m clueless. “This isn’t about his personality. If it was, it wouldn’t be a problem because he’s charming and nice. But his endorsement contracts have a morality clause. He has to stay in good standing, or he loses them. Even the club contract has the same condition. If he keeps this up, he’ll lose his job.”

“It can’t be that bad.”

“It is! Even his management’s on his ass. I know he might be going through something, but this isn’t it. You know Jessica Monroe? From Confidential Family?”

At the mention of my and Tess’s favorite show, I perk up. “Who doesn’t?”

“Exactly!” She looks furious when she adds, “They’re supposed to be dating and in a happy relationship, but last night, pictures came out of him on a date with her co-star.”

My jaw drops. “He cheated on THE Jessica Monroe?”

Tess grabs a cookie and chews it angrily. “I don’t know. I was too busy being pissed off that he was dumb enough to get photographed at such a crucial time. I didn’t even think to ask. Everyone knows Jessica Monroe! Confidential Family is the most-watched show right now. Her fans are going crazy, flaming him on social media.”

“Well, he deserves it. She’s way too hot for him anyway.” I’ve never seen the guy, but Jessica’s basically a goddess. “What a scumbag.”",2,1759956805.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

The N150 is within 3% performance as the N100 so I'll just consider the same for comparisons sake. 

For example, i5-8260U has ~14% higher aggregate single-core benchmarks and ~33–35 % higher “aggregate” multi-core benchmarks. For all of that extra performance, the TDP is still only 15W, up from 6W with the N100/150. If you look at it just on a perf/watt ratio.. they are almost identical. They also idle at the same power draw. The N chips dont' even have double channel memory.

The 8000 series came out in 2017. I just find it odd that a CPU from that year can go head to head with the 'low power king' of 2024/2025. Is there any better low power chip that can also win in perf/watt below 15W? 

It seems like at extremely low power (e.g. 6 W), overheads like leakage, static power, and shared subsystems (cache, uncore, memory controller) become a larger fraction of total. Gains from process or architecture improvements are harder to realize?

Why would I pay $150 for a new N150 mini-pc when I could pick up a used NUC with an i5-8000U CPU for $60 with nearly double the multi-core performance and negligible diff in power usage?",0,1759956667.0,homelab,17,0.22,False

One store is in a typical shopping area. 
One store is in an area of town people tend to speak poorly about. 
I went to the 2nd option for the first time in years today and was not disappointed! It was way bigger than the other store, clean, and stocked really well plus a very friendly staff. 
There were only two sanitizers left so I grabbed them both (one for me, one for my daughter who is in college and student teaching).
The hand sanitizer case looks pink in the photo, but it is actually a gorgeous candy apple red.

[\[Part Two\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1i9fg/the_perfect_day_to_wake_up_part_two/)

I didn’t sleep much that night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the words: *We see you.* Not just as text, as if someone had carved them behind my eyelids. I tried telling myself it was just stress. Work, routine, caffeine. But every thought looped back to the same whisper I’d heard in the bathroom: *Wake up.*

By morning, I felt hollow. I didn’t shower. Didn’t make toast. Just sat there, watching my watch tick. I thought if I stared long enough, maybe I’d catch it twitch again.

It didn’t. It was perfect. Too perfect.

At 6:17 a.m., my alarm still went off.

I hadn’t even set it.

The sound made me jump. My heart felt like it was trying to punch through my chest.

I turned it off, grabbed my keys, and decided not to go to work today. Not the café, not the office. I’d drive somewhere else. Anywhere else.

When I stepped outside, the air felt heavier. Thicker. Like breathing through fabric. The neighborhood was exactly the same, same lawns, same houses, same cars parked in the same places. Not one curtain moved.

As I pulled out of the driveway, I glanced at the car’s clock.  
6:43 a.m.

When I reached the main road, it was still 6:43 a.m.

The numbers didn’t move.

The highway was empty, the horizon a washed-out blur. I drove faster. A long stretch of road wound through fields, but after a few miles, the scenery repeated. The same cracked billboard, the same bent road sign, the same dead crow on the shoulder.

At first, I thought it was déjà vu. Then I realized, it wasn’t *similar.*  
It was identical.

I passed the same scene five times before slamming the brakes.

The engine idled, low and uneven. I sat there gripping the steering wheel, watching heat shimmer on the asphalt.

I turned on the radio.

Static.

Then, faintly, a voice came through, calm, polite, rehearsed.

*“Everything’s okay, Daniel. Go home.”*

My stomach dropped.

It was *my name.*

*“You’re having a bad day, Daniel. That’s all.”*

I switched the radio off. My hands were shaking.

When I turned the car around, the clock jumped to 7:02 a.m.

The sun brightened suddenly, too bright, like someone had turned up a dimmer switch. The light hit everything evenly, no shadows, no depth.

By the time I pulled back into my street, people were outside.

Joggers. Dog walkers. Neighbors. All of them smiling too wide. All of them turning their heads in perfect unison when my car rolled past.

One of them waved.

Her lips didn’t move, but I heard her voice inside my head, as clear as if she were sitting next to me:

*“Welcome back.”*

I nearly crashed into my mailbox.

I ran inside, locked the door, and sat against it. My breathing came out ragged, hands shaking.

I tried calling my sister. She lived two states away. She’d know how to calm me down, tell me it was all in my head.

The call rang once.

Then a click.

And her voice: *“Hey, Danny.”*

*“Hey,”* I said, forcing a laugh. *“I just-uh, weird question. Can you tell me what day it is?”*

A pause.

Then she laughed, soft and mechanical.

*“It’s the perfect day.”*

My blood ran cold.

*“What?”*

*“It’s the perfect day, Danny. It’s always been the perfect day.”*

I hung up. The phone buzzed in my hand, same number calling back. I threw it onto the couch.

I sat there for what felt like hours, trying to steady my breathing. My reflection in the TV screen looked pale, distant. Then the TV turned on by itself.

No static this time. Just my house. Live feed.

The camera angle was impossible, from the ceiling, looking down at *me.*

I stared at myself staring back.

Then a voice, male this time, calm, reassuring, spoke from the television: 

*“Don’t panic, Daniel. You’re doing great.”*

I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the coffee table.

*“You’ve been adjusting well. Small inconsistencies are normal during observation.”*

*“Who are you?”* I shouted.

No response.

*“You’re safe here.”*

I hurled the remote at the screen. It cracked, flickered, and went black. My heart was hammering so hard I thought I might pass out.

Then I heard it, a faint knock at the door.

Three slow knocks.

I froze.

The peephole was dark, like someone had covered it with their hand.

*“Who is it?”* I called out, voice shaking.

A pause. Then:

*“Your coffee.”*

The barista’s voice. The one from the café.

I stepped back, the floor creaking beneath me.

*“You forgot your coffee, Daniel.”*

Another knock. Louder.

*“You have to stay on schedule.”*

I backed away until my legs hit the couch.

Then my phone buzzed on the cushion. One new text. No number.

**DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR**

I stared at the message, then at the door.

The knocking stopped.

Silence.

After a long moment, I crept forward and peered through the peephole.

No one there.

Just the street, still, empty, washed in white light.

Then, faintly, from somewhere far beyond the walls of my house, I heard the applause.

A crowd. Cheering.

And above it all, a voice echoing through unseen speakers:

*“Cut to commercial.”*",1,1759956520.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1o1mwgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o1mwgd/sp_echoes_of_ezoz/,[SP] Echoes Of Ezoz,"Echoes Of Ezoz

*I. Descent*

The first alarm went off halfway through a systems check. Two minutes before entry.

A single red light blinked at the edge of the console, then a second, then a whole row like falling dominos. The ship’s vibration deepened from a hum to a tremor. We weren’t flying anymore; we were dropping. I’d trained for emergencies, but not this many at once.

“Stabilizers offline,” I said into the recorder. “Switching to manual.”

Procedure lives where panic would like to. The controls felt loose. I eased aft thrust to try and bring the nose up, but the response was slow and uneven. The flight computer froze, coughed back control, then froze again. 

Ezoz filled the viewport. Cloud bands wrapped the planet in neat, repeated arcs. The atmosphere glowed blue, streaked with lightning that followed exact, parallel paths across the cloud top. Bolt after bolt landing exactly where the last one had, like someone had drawn the storm with a ruler. Strange, but not the priority.

Heat built fast. The hull started to shake. Numbers on the pressure gauge jumped in random order. I knew what that meant: the sensors had given up.

“Main thrusters, pulse three,” I said. The button blinked red, then nothing. The descent alarm started to scream.

I hit record again,even as the cabin shook, because that’s what training tells you to do when you can’t fix the problem. “Mission log four-two-seven. Descent unstable. Loss of telemetry. Attempting–”

Static roared through the comm. For a moment, I thought I heard something buried inside it. A voice – my voice – saying, **You’re already home.** Then the sound was gone.

The capsule bucked hard. A seam tore somewhere behind me with a metallic pop. Heat rushed through the cabin in a single bright flash.
I remember the light more than the impact. White. Blinding. Then nothing

*II. Surface*

I woke up on my back, helmet tilted against something firm. The wind moved over me – steady, cool, carrying a faint metallic smell. My suits' diagnostics blinked green. Pressure normal. Oxygen twenty-one percent. Gravity one gee.

Too perfect.

I rolled onto my side and pushed up to my knees. The ground was short copper-colored grass that hissed when I brushed it, releasing little sparks of static. The world hummed faintly, a constant low vibration I could feel through my boots. The ground might as well have been waiting for me. 

The sky was violet. Not evening violet – uniform, as if painted. No sun in sight, just a broad, even brightness. There was no wreckage anywhere. No trench, no crater. If the ship had hit this plain, it would have carved a wound a kilometer wide. The ship must have been reduced to nothing or I was thrown far from it. 

“Mission Control, this is Explorer Four,” I said into the comm, my voice sounded too loud in the helmet. “Do you copy?”

Only static came back. Slow, rhythmic. Like breathing.

I ran diagnostics again, but everything looked fine. My suit even reported a healthy heart rate. I stood carefully, expecting pain. It didn’t come nor did vertigo. My boots found the ground but I felt disconnected, as if my body and the ground were running on separate clocks. 

In the distance, towers stood in even ranks, reflecting that violet light. A city stretched across the horizon, every building aligned in a perfect grid. It didn’t make sense – Ezoz had been classified uninhabited – but the city was there, solid and bright.

I start walking.

*III. The Wilds*

The plain broke into low ridges and shallow basins. Nothing dramatic – just geology doing its job. The grass gave way to flats or charcoal- colored stone. Here and there lay puddles as clear as glass. The air had a taste to it I tried to name but settled on “burnt metal.”

I kept running checks I knew were pointless. Suit pressure, oxygen reserve, heart rate. All fine. I told myself I did this out of discipline, not superstition.
There were moving things far off – shapes low to the ground that came to the edge of my vision and withdrew again. When I knelt to look for tracks, the soil offered nothing. The puddles didn’t ripple when the wind crossed them. When I looked up, the cloud bands shifted in lockstep like gears.

I tried to chart a straight path to the city. My wrist comp set a heading and showed a dotted line path. Minutes later the line drifted under my feet without the arrow moving. I recalibrated twice. On the third try I laughed at myself and picked the tallest tower as a cue.

Memory began to float up in patches. Not vision – just thoughts with weight. My father pointing at a plane as it broke cloud. My simulator failure and the way the instructor didn’t smile when I swore. The sound a cup makes when you set it on a countertop and think about changing your life.

The terrain cooperated just enough. A ridge that looked endless ended exactly where I decided to stop and rest. A formation that resembled columnar basalt turned out to be just that, too regular to be random and too clean to be old. When I drank from a puddle, the water tasted like its been filtered for a century. 

An hour from the city, I came to a rise that felt familiar without being anything I’ve seen before. I knew where I would set a bench if I were building a park here. When I reached the crest, there was a bench. Simple metal slats. A dent in the second seat looked like someone had sat there many times a little too hard.

I didn’t sit. I touched the dent with a glove and kept walking.

*IV. The City of Selves*

Up close, the city looked almost alive. Steel and glass, concrete where concrete should go. Streets ran in a grid. The kind of grind someone who liked grids would draw. No litter, no posters peeled half off. No small mistakes.

People moved along the sidewalks. Every one of them was me. Not mirror images – different hair lengths, a scar I didn't have, a jacket I’d owned in school. Expressions I knew from photographs. A man my age in a uniform that never existed in the program. A middle-aged me with a ring. A younger me with a perfect limp I remembered faking once to avoid a race and immediately regretting it.

They saw me. They didn’t gawk. Some nodded like colleagues passing in a hallway. One smiled with a look I’ve used when I think I know someone and can’t place where from.

I crossed at an intersection when the signal changed and realized the timing matched my stride. From the corner of my eye I caught a storefront with my name smudged on the door glass. I turned to look directly and the smudge was only a smudge.

I entered a café that stood on the corner. Inside, a man in a dark shirt cleaned a portafilter with the easy efficiency of someone who’s done it every morning for years. He was older than me by a couple of decades. Gray at the temples. 

“Coffee?” he asked.

I took my gloves off carefully and placed them on the counter. “Yes. Please.”

He ground beans, tamped, and pulled a shot. Everything was exactly right without trying to prove it. I looked around the café. Everything was ordinary: steel counter, white tiles, a faint smell of roasted beans. The only thing wrong was how right it all felt. He set a cup down in front of me. The heat through the porcelain felt honest. I wrapped my hands around it and waited for whatever would prove this was a hallucination. Nothing did.

“How long have you been here?” I asked.

“A while,” he said.

I looked out the window. Two versions of me crossed the street in opposite directions and didn’t see each other. The hum I’d been hearing since I woke seemed louder here. Not loud – near.

“Where am I?” I asked.

The man didn’t look surprised. He rinsed the filter and said, “You’re on Ezoz.”

“That’s not possible.” I said. “Ezoz was listed as uninhabited.”

He nodded slightly, drying off his hands on a towel. “That’s what they said.”

“Then how are you here? How is any of this here?”
He leaned on the counter. Pouring a cup for himself before speaking again. I watched him patiently. 

“Some questions take a little distance to answer,” he said. “If you want the truth –  or at least a better version of it – you’ll find it at the tower in the center. You might even be able to connect to where you need to go from there.”

“The tower?” I repeated.

He pointed through the window. The spire rose above the city, straight and calm against the violet sky.

“Its not far,” he said. “You’ll know when you’re close.”

He didn’t say more, and for some reason I didn’t ask. It felt like we’d already had the conversation on some other day.

“Will you walk with me?” I said.

“If you want company.”

I did.

*V. Walk*

We cut across the grid, the older man setting a pace I could match without thinking about it. We followed a wide avenue toward the tower. The streets were clean, the kind of clean that never lasts in real cities. 

“You never answered,” I said. “How long have you been here?”

He smiled without looking back. “Long enough to stop counting.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It’s the only one that fits.”

We passed a park, grass trimmed to the millimeter. A version of me – thinner, younger – sat on a bench with a woman whose face I couldn't bring into focus. They were laughing. I didn’t remember the moment, but the sound felt like something I’d lost. 

“I keep seeing myself,” I said. “Everywhere I look, it’s me. It’s… unsettling.”

He nodded. “It is at first. You try to spot what’s different about them, but that never lasts.”

I glanced at a shop window where another version of me was counting change, lips moving with numbers I already knew by heart.

 “So what do you look for instead?” I asked.
He smiled faintly. “You stop looking for differences after a while. You start noticing what stays the same.”

“And what’s that?”

He took a slow breath, eyes on the tower in the distance. “The way we keep moving forward, even when there’s nowhere left to go.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, so I didn’t. We just kept walking, the street humming softly under our feet. The air carried that faint metallic tang again, the smell of the ship just before the hull gave way. I wanted to ask him if he saw me crashing, but the words caught somewhere behind my teeth.

At a street corner, an older version of me was teaching a child to ride a bike. The boy wobbled, found balance, and grinned up at the man who wasn’t me. I slowed, watching until they turned a corner and vanished.

“Did you have kids?” he asked.

“No,” I said. “Never found the time.”

He gave a soft hum. “We always think there’s time, until we start measuring it.”

We crossed into a plaza ringed with stone pillars. Names were carved into them – hundreds, maybe thousands – some I recognized faintly like women I dated and lost – but most I did not recognize at all. The letters shimmered faintly.

“What are they?” I asked.

“People you might have known,” he said. “Or maybe just people who wanted to be remembered.”

That answer hit deeper than I expected. I didn’t reply.

A few blocks later, we came to a glass building that looked like a hospital. The lights inside flickered in a steady rhythm, like heart monitors. For a moment, the wind brought a smell I hadn’t thought of in years – sterile air, the faint sweetness of dying flowers. My throat tightened.

He said quietly, “Someone important to you?”

“My mother,” I said. “I wasn’t there when she–” I stopped. The words felt too sharp.

“She knew,” he said.

“How would you know that?” He didn’t answer, just kept walking. I followed.

The tower loomed ahead now, its surface reflecting the city like a calm sea. It didn't seem to end; it just kept narrowing until it met the sky.

“You still haven’t told me who you are,” I said.

He smiled, but there was something tired in it. “Someone who’s been where you’re going.”

“And where’s that?”

“The top,” he said simply. “That’s where everything starts making sense.”

We walked the last stretch in silence. My suit sensors ticked steadily in my ear, reading perfect conditions. When we reached the base of the tower, the door slid open on its own.

He stopped just short of the threshold. “This is where I leave you,” he said.

“Why? You said you’ve been there.”

“I have,” he said, matter of factly. “But this is your mission not mine.”

I hesitated. “What’s at the top?”

He nodded toward the open elevator inside. “Maybe an answer. Maybe a way home. Depends what you need more.”

I looked back once before stepping in. He was still standing there, hands in his pockets, watching me the way you’d watch a departing ship – knowing it's going where it has to.

*VI. The Tower*

The elevator was waiting. No buttons. No sound when the doors closed. Just a smooth lift that felt less like movement and more like being remembered by something large.

It stopped without a jolt. The door slid open to a corridor washed in soft white light. The air felt thicker here, as if it was holding in breath in anticipation of something. I stepped out.

The first room looked like a hanger – bright floors, high ceiling. My ship was there: panels intact, instruments steady, everything exactly as it should have been before entry. I walked around it once. My reflection looked back at me from the window, calm, unhurt. I blinked, and the cabin was empty again. Just metal and silence.

The next level opened to a small apartment – mine, years ago. The smell of burnt coffee and ink. Papers stacked high on the counter, most of them unread. A desk covered in sketches of flight patterns and equations that didn’t matter anymore. A soft hum from the wall unit that had never worked right. I heard a sound from another room and my younger self walked by, brushing past me without noticing. He looked tired, but driven. I didn’t stop him. 

She was there. 

Elena.

Not as she was when I left, not exactly – she's just as I remember her when memory tries to be kind. Hair half-tied, a mug in one hand, watching me over the rum with that quiet patience she used instead of anger.

“I made dinner,” she said,and even knowing it wasn’t real, the sound of her voice cracked something open inside me.

“I know,” I said. “I just need another hour.”

The scene replayed exactly as I recalled. She set the mug down. The argument was small, like most of them had been. Little cuts made by time.
“You keep chasing something out there,” she said. “Just make sure you don’t lose everything in here.”

I didn’t answer her then, and I didn’t now.

The vision of her turned, fading into the next room as the light dimmed. The desk, the mugs, the smell of coffee and ink– all folded away until there was only the sound of that hum.

I stood a while, staring at the empty chair. “I should’ve stayed,” I said, though no one was listening. “I’m sorry, Elena.”

The hum shifted as the elevator opened again.
Another floor: a hospital corridor. A bed at the end of it. The same flowers. The same air, too clean to breathe. I didn’t walk closer. I already knew what waited.

Room after room, memory after memory – the training hanger, the first launch, faces blurred by time but heavy with meaning. I stopped trying to categorize them. The tower wasn’t judging me. It was simply showing me.

When I reached the top, the door opened to open air.

A wide platform stretched beneath the violet sky. The city below looked impossibly distant, the grid softened by the haze. A single bench faces the horizon.

There he sat – the man from the café, hands folded, eyes on the skyline. I walk over and sat beside him.

For a long time, we just sat there. The wind was  steady. The horizon shimmered like heat over metal. The city below is quiet now, its lights dimming one by one. 

“I think I understand now,” I said quietly.
He nodded once. “You usually do, by this point.”
“I didn’t survive the crash.” Saying it out loud felt like releasing pressure from a valve. “That's what this is.I’m dead”

He nodded slowly. “Dying,” he said. “There’s a difference.”

I watched the city fade, street by street. “All this time I thought I was on my way somewhere—another mission, another discovery. I thought if I could just keep moving, I’d earn the right to stop. But there’s always another system, another problem, another distance.”

“And now?” he asked.

“Now I think I just wanted it to mean something,” I said. “To prove that leaving was worth it. That losing her was worth it.”

He looked at me then, eyes kind, but heavier than before. “Was it?”

I thought about Elena – the way she stood in the doorway while I packed, not asking me to stay, not forgiving me for leaving either. “No,” I said quietly. “It wasn’t”

He didn’t argue. He just let the silence hold.

“I told myself it was for humanity,” I said. “For exploration, for knowledge. But it was for me. I wanted to be remembered.”

“You still will be,” he said.

“That’s not the same thing,” I said. “Being remembered isn’t being known.”

For the first time, he smiled. “You’re learning.”
The tower hummed softly beneath us, the same pitch the ship made before it tore apart, but steadier – gentler. It felt alive now, like something listening.

“I keep thinking about her,” I said. “If she’d asked me to stay, I would have. But she didn’t.”

“She did,” he said. “Just not in words you were willing to hear.”

I let out a slow breath. The city was nearly gone now, melting into light. “So this is it, then. The End.”

He shook his head “ No. The moment after the end.”

“I thought death would be silence.”

He looked at me “It is. But first, it lets you finish your sentence.”

The hum grew quieter, almost tender. I closed my eyes. For the first time since the crash, I didn’t feel the need to speak, to record, to report. All the questions that had driven me – where, how, why – finally emptied into a single thought.

“I wasn’t supposed to find a new world,” I said. “I was meant to understand the one I left.”

He smiled faintly. “And now you do.”

The wind moved around us again, warm and weightless. Below the light of the city folded into the ground, leaving only the tower and the sky.

*VII. The Door*

He stood first, and for a moment I thought the bench might tip without his weight on it. But it stayed level. Everything did.

The wind came in from the east, brushing against us like the first touch of sleep.

At the far side of the platform, a door waited.
Not ornate. Not glowing. Just there. Plain steel, with light spilling from the seams in a steady pulse, like a heartbeat that had decided to keep time without me.

I rose slowly. “What’s behind it?”

He studied the horizon for a moment before answering. “Something that doesn’t need you to explain it.”

“Is it… home?” I asked.

He smiled faintly. “Maybe. Or maybe it’s where you stop needing one.”

I walked toward the door. The metal shimmered faintly in the violet light, edges soft as if the world couldn’t decide where to end. The closer I got, the less it looked like steel. It looked like memory—every door I’d ever closed behind me, every departure I’d justified.

“Will you come with me?” I asked, glancing back.
He was still by the bench, hands in his pockets, watching the horizon instead of me. “I already have,” he said.

The hum that had followed me since the crash was gone now. Not faded—gone, like it had finished its job.

 For a moment, I thought about Elena again. About all the words I hadn’t said, all the nights I’d spent believing distance was progress. I understood, finally, what she’d meant that night in the kitchen.

Make sure you don’t lose everything in here.
I had. But maybe that was okay. Maybe understanding counted for something.
The door’s surface pulsed softly under my hand. It wasn’t cold or warm—just alive, waiting. I took a breath, steady and deliberate.

“Mission log,” I said quietly. “Final entry.”

 A pause.

 “Crew of one. Destination unknown.”

I pushed.

Light poured through, not blinding, not bright—just enough to see by. The air smelled clean, like the first breath of a world before names. For a second I felt weightless, the same sensation as the moment before impact. Except this time, there was no fear.

I thought I heard his voice behind me, but maybe it was my own.

“You’re home,” it said. “Be here.”

I stepped through.

i’ve been yearning for what feels like forever.
i miss your voice, your laugh, your touch, your beautiful brown eyes, your smile, your curly hair, your body, your beard, i miss your scars, i miss your tattoos, i miss you breathing next to me, i miss falling asleep in your arms. 
i miss your stupid corny jokes. i miss when you’d sing off key to our favorite songs. i miss your goofiness. i miss the way you held your cigarettes. i miss your little catchphrases that i picked up on and say now. i miss everything about you.
i still say our inside jokes. i still listen to the songs you showed me especially on the days where i miss you most. 
i miss you worst when it’s fall season and the colors start to change. i miss you whenever i hear Deftones playing. i miss you when i watch certain shows or movies. i miss you during summer when it’s hot out, especially the fourth of july i absolutely feel empty on the fourth of july. i miss you whenever it rains. 
i miss you when i look down the street hoping ill see your car (even tho we live miles away from each other now) i miss you when it gets slow at work. i miss you when it’s 3pm and 3am. i miss you when it’s dark and im looking at the stars and the moon. i miss you when the sunsets. i miss you when im taking a walk. 
i miss you when i get coffee. i miss you when i look at the trees. i miss you when im out in public in room full of people and the only person i want to be around is you. i still search for you and your face in every room i go into. 
i miss you when i get a breakfast sandwich. 

i will always miss you. i will forever love you. you know this.. i’ve told you this. i can’t bring myself to fully close the door and block you. i can’t let it go. i don’t know how to let it go. i don’t want to. i know i left. i know we weren’t perfect but we were young and stupid and i wasn’t sober. i’m sober now im 2 years sober now!! i want to forgive you. i want to come back home and try this again. i still feel like our story isn’t over. i go to sleep and dream of you. i wake up and i think of you. anytime something happens wether it’s good or bad or random you’re the first person i wanna call and tell. everywhere i go and visit i wish you were there next to me seeing it- experiencing it with me. 
i want to come back home. i miss you. i miss the mountains. i miss home. i want to come home. i’ve tried i moving on.. ive tried falling in love with someone else and i just can’t. i don’t have it in me. i don’t want to learn someone else. i don’t want to get undressed for a new person all over again. i don’t want to fall asleep next to a new person. i don’t wanna get to know someone else. i don’t want to love someone else.. i can’t and i’ve tried to. i don’t want anyone else. i just want you. i’m still so connected to you. i still feel you in my soul. i can’t stop it and i can’t let it go. i can’t fight it anymore.. i don’t want to. it’s exhausting! nobody and nothing compares to you or the love we shared and i don’t think anybody ever will. i told you that you were the love of my life and i meant it.

do you ever think of me? do you wish i’d come home? do you still love me? would you forgive me now that we’re a little bit older and i’m sober? would you listen to me and hear me out? do you miss me at all? do i cross your mind? are you haunted by me as much as im haunted by you?

I also adore poetry, literature, travelling, reading, swimming, baking, and history. I’m always up for learning new things, trying out niche interests, or just grabbing a coffee and chatting. Languages and culture fascinate me too, and I find people’s unique perspectives really cool.

I’m studying psychology and excited to meet people beyond my course. If you’re down to talk, hang out, or show me around Cardiff, please feel free to DM me, I’d love to connect. Also if you have any suggestions to help me find new friends. Please let me know. Thanks!

Okay, okay, it’s official. My “just browsing” phase has fully evolved into certified bagaholic behavior 😅👜 What started as “I’ll just get one versatile piece” somehow turned into a whole collection that perfectly sums up my entire mood board. Some of these I actually picked up months ago but never got around to posting, and honestly, every single one deserves their moment. ✨

Let’s talk details: I’ve bought the Loop Hobo three times now trying to find the one, and ladies and gentlemen, we’ve found her. God Factory wins again! 🙌 I also have an authentic Speedy 30, so I’ll be doing a comparison with the God Factory 25 soon 👀 And yes, I couldn’t resist adding another piece to my Chanel trash bag collection. This light gray one is giving everything it needs to give! It’s so perfectly neutral, I know I’ll be carrying it through fall, spring, and summer. And let’s not forget the Chanel 19s. Truly a must-have for any bag girlie! They’re that perfect mix of classy and casual. I love them so much that I ordered the maxi version too, because let’s be real, I’m a big bag girlie who carries her whole life with her 😌

There’s just something about unboxing a new bag that gives me the same rush as putting on a perfect outfit or taking that first sip of iced coffee. Pure serotonin ✨🩷 Each piece feels like a different version of me: confident, inspired, and just a little main character energy.

So yes, maybe I have a few too many, but if loving bags is wrong, I don’t ever want to be right 😌👜💋 Now the real question is, which one should make her debut first? 👀 👀💭

Here are some of the deets: 🫰🏽

This entire haul is from the homie Jimmy (WA# +86 181 2578 7703) He’s truly amazing! He’s been my consistent seller that never lets me down. Been shopping with him since October of 2024 so he’s like a bestie that I don’t talk to every day, but when I do, it’s like we don’t skip a beat! 🫶🏽🥰

This cold is kicking my butt and I didn't sleep well so I scrap my plans to go to Kichijogi, take some Tylenol and stay closer to go to Ginza instead.

Get a black sesame latte at a coffee shop $5.34 while I wait for Uniqlo to open. Go there and get a dress, rain/UV jacket, pants and some period underwear for $102. Visit Muji and get some more period underwear $17 and lunch at the cafe, prosciutto sandwich and ginger ale $11. It's really hot now so I head back to the hotel on the train and get ready to go to tennis again tonight. 

I take the train and the bus to the arena, which takes forever, and watch Taylor Fritz and Casper Ruud play. Eat dinner of salmon onigiri, melon pan and dried figs that I brought. Take the bus back to the hotel then bed.

9/27 Saturday 

I'm leaving Tokyo today to go to Matsumoto. Shower and pack up then take the train up there $45. Get lunch and a drink at Shinjuku station for the ride $10.

Arrive in Matsumoto and walk to my hotel. Head to Matsumoto Castle $7.50 as it closes soon, and make my way to the top. I liked Himeji castle better for the view from the top but the outside of this one is cool as it's black and white. Enjoy the sunset at the castle gardens and research tomorrow's trip to Kamikochi. The direct bus is sold out so I will get the non-direct train and bus. 

Get ramen for dinner $10 and the couple next to me is from Snohomish, WA so we talk throughout dinner. The owner/cook is so nice and at the end he writes our name in kanji on a little card for us to take home.
Walk around town for a bit on the way back to the hotel, apparently Italian is popular here as I see 4 different restaurants, and an Irish pub.

Get my reserved bus tickets online to and back for Kamikochi $45, plus I need a train ticket tomorrow at the station which is cash only.

Daily total $117.50 Steps 8,831

9/28 Sunday 

Pack up my suitcase to send ahead to Kanazawa at the hotel front desk, leaving a few clothes for the next few days in my back pack $8.
My phone died overnight as apparently it wasn't charging, so I ask the front desk to print my bus ticket emails just in case. 

Go to the train station and get a ticket $4.75. arrive at the next station to transfer to the bus. Apparently I was supposed to take my ticket with me so I have to buy another one to exit the station $4.75. 

Get on the bus to Kamikochi, fortunately there is a plug to keep charging my phone and power bank.
Get off at Taiso Pond stop and get a water $1.30. Walk the trails to the main station and get lunch of mushroom and vegetable udon $8 and snacks and dessert for later $11.71. Walk the trails a bit more and see some monkeys, including the cutest babies playing in the trees. I visit the Myojin First Pond shrine $3.34 and loop back around by the Dakesawa Marsh. I get another water $1.67.

I have to run to the bus because I thought it was by the food stations where a lot of people are waiting, but the stop is further down the road. I get on the bus and then the train back to Matsumoto. Get cash and food $9.22 from 7/11 because at this point all I want is a bath and bed. Back to the hotel and eat my chicken sandwich and cabbage salad. Take a bath and put on a face mask. Eat chocolate ice cream for dessert then go to bed.

9/29 Monday

Check out of the hotel and visit the timepiece museum. I wanted to visit the city museum but they are closed today. Go to Frog Street, a touristy couple of blocks by the river. See a Portuguese custard tart shop and get a couple $5.50, they have a special today with lime curd topping that is soooo good. 

Walk back to the hotel to get my backpack, then stop at 7/11 to get salmon onigiri, a drink and more cough drops $6. Add $13 to my IC card as well. Buy nail clippers at a pharmacy $10.31.

Go to the train station and buy a ticket to Shinano-Omachi station $4.57, then the bus to Omachi $11 where I will start the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. Get my ticket for the route $82.73. 

I end up getting on one of the last busses of the day to go up the mountain. I didn't realize how long it would take me to get here from Matsumoto, about 3 hours including waiting, so I probably should have checked the train times before I left. I'm staying the night at a lodge on top of the mountain halfway through the route, so that is why I wasn't rushing to get here.

It's very foggy and rainy at the top, so not really any views unfortunately. Arrive at my hotel at Tengudaira stop. Dinner is included and they have it all laid out for us with assigned tables, a variety of vegetables, udon noodle soup, rice, salmon and chicken katsu.
It's too foggy to see the sunset unfortunately, but later they open the cafe and I get a slice of cheesecake and ginger ale $6 then to bed

9/30 Tuesday 

I just miss the sunrise but go outside early because it finally cleared. Breakfast at 6:20 am which I eat a bit of, I can't usually eat food that early in the morning. An interesting mix of sausage, scrambled eggs, green salad, goat cheese cubes, mashed potatoes, minestrone soup, rolls and fruit.

Take the free shuttle back to the previous stop to walk around more. There's a couple hour window of good weather today in the morning so I want to see all I can. The views are incredible and the fall colors are just starting to turn. I buy a coffee and a ticket for the bus to the next stop again $4.92.

Make my way down the mountain, doing some walking around at a couple of stops. Get a water, another coffee and a beef croquet $5 while waiting for the train to Toyama. At Toyama take the train to Kanazawa and walk to my hotel. Start laundry $3.38, finally find my favorite sparkling apple drink and get one and an iced lemon tea for later $1.76, take a shower, and unpack.

Go out to Lawson to get cash at the ATM and add $6.76 to my Suica card. Ask the front desk of my hotel to make me a dinner reservation for tomorrow night at barrier, then pick up my laundry. I also get a nice email from the hotel I just stayed at asking me to work there as they need English speakers, lol. So if you speak English and want to work in Japan on top of a mountain, check out Tengudaira Mountain Lodge.

I watch the final of the Japan Open on my phone, my two favorites Carlos and Taylor are playing. Carlos wins but it seems like Taylor was hurting, so I hope he is okay. Go get sushi for dinner, a 10 piece set with miso soup $17, then back to the hotel for bed.

Daily total $38.82 Steps 13,641 

10/1 Wednesday 

It's raining today, but should clear in the afternoon, fortunately. I walk over to Omichi market, and it's mostly stalls of fish, fruit/veg and food to eat. I can't eat sushi or oysters at 9am but some people are.

I then walk to the Higashichaya area and get a hojicha latte and a cute bunny sweet $7.77, the lady there is sweet and we chat a bit through translation app and she tries some English.

Then I walk to Kenroku-en Garden $3.38 (for combined ticket to it and the castle) and walk around. I run into the lady I sat next to on the train out of Tokyo last week, small world. I get lunch at a restaurant near the garden and get a pork tonkatsu plate with rice and miso soup, and a plum juice $15. 

Then I walk to the castle. Only a few of the gates remain as the main palace burnt down in the 19th century. They are in the process of rebuilding it with traditional construction methods, and it's cool to see the process and methods explained in the exhibit.

Next I walk to Oyama Shrine and visit a gift shop where they have replica samurai swords that the shop owner shows me. I get a gold leaf bookmark for my mom and a postcard $6.24. Gold leaf is very popular here and Kanazawa produces 99% of it in Japan, they even have a museum for it but it's closed. Back to the hotel to recharge myself and phone, get a free matcha latte in the lobby.

Walk out to the river to watch the sunset and see a crane and an egret in the river. Go to dinner at barrier and have a set course menu of prosciutto and lotus root appetizer, and 3 main courses of grilled vegetables, horse mackerel, and roasted duck which all have dashi poured over them to eat. Then 3 pieces of sushi, chicken ramen and micro green ice cream plus a green tea $44.43. This was my splurge meal for the trip, which ended up being not as much as I expected as I've definitely paid that much back home for like 2 courses haha.
Walk back to the hotel and take a bath then bed.

10/2 Thursday 

I visit the Nomura-ke Samurai Heritage Residence and walk around the Samurai district. I get 2 small plates at a pottery store $15. The replica house looks like mid-century modern honestly, and the garden is beautiful. Next I walk to Pan Brothers and get some pastries $6.40, an apple I eat right away, a lemon and a fig. 

Then I walk to the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art $2, there is also a special exhibit of artists Hiroshige and Hokusai that is very cool $9.42 but no pictures are allowed so I get several postcards $6.20. 
Next I go to the National Crafts Museum next door but there is only a single exhibit of one artist’s pottery so I don't go inside. 

I go to the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of History instead $2 and the nearby Honda Museum $3.40. Then I get cash at an ATM and get lunch of chicken katsu curry $6.30. I like this curry better than the one yesterday, the crust is crispier and this one has a more spice flavor profile, the other was like sweet barbecue sauce. I get a mochi doughnut next door after leaving $1.75.

Go back to the hotel to rest for a bit then take the train to Uchinada beach $2.72 for the train. National IC cards are not accepted here so have to pay separate for the buses and local train. I've been walking mostly but took the bus twice today $2.85.

I come about an hour before sunset and the weather is perfect with only a slight wind. I thought there would be more here but it's just sand, the most low key beach town ever I guess. I read a book on my phone until the sunset, the sun looks like a fireball in the sky it's so big. It's going down right behind a huge ship on a dock and there are a few other boats in the ocean, if anyone has played Dredge it reminds of that honestly. And the moon is out at the same time which is cool. Then get dinner of shrimp yakisoba at a small shop $4.75 and take the train back $2.72.

10/3 Friday 

Check out of the hotel and take the Shinkansen train to Tokyo $98, get a drink and tuna onigiri at the Tokyo station $3. Take the train to pick up my glasses, then the train to my hotel in Akasaka. Check in isn't for another hour, so I leave my bags there and they take them to my room. Not sure why my bags can be in the room but I can't?

Take the train to Yoyogi Park and walk around, then go to Meiji Jingu shrine and walk around. Go to the @cosme store, basically Sephora, then get a matcha latte, 2 macarons and a matcha canele $6, then walk around Harajuku. Visit PDX Taproom in Harajuku to look around, I don't drink beer so don't get anything but it's cute with all the Portland stuff and I sign the guestbook. 

Bus to Shibuya and go to the Mega Don Quijote to get sunscreen and KitKats $81, I get 9 tubes of 3 different kinds, with all this tariff BS it's more expensive to get Asian sunscreen in the US now. They don't have 1 brand I like, so stop at the drugstore a few doors down and get 3 tubes $15.70. 
train back to the hotel to check in, I guess they upgraded me to a twin room which has 2 beds and a little more room so that's nice.

Walk to get dinner of ramen $10.50 then to the nearby Hie shrine. It's closed but they have a small stair pathway of red Torii gates. Walk back to the hotel, get a Sprite $0.75 and chill on the rooftop patio then bed.

10/4 Saturday 

Pack up and everything barely fits in my bags fortunately. I thought about checking my suitcase but I have to self transfer at LAX in only 2 hours so don't want to risk it.

I have 4 hours before I have to leave for the airport, so I take the train up to Ueno and go to the Western Art Museum which I skipped last time $3.39. It's a small but good collection with several themed displays throughout. They have a Monet Waterlily that I haven't seen before, as well as a Picasso exhibit, and I get a few post cards at the shop $3.38.

Outside in the park it's raining but there is a Latin festival with a bunch of food trucks so I get a Cubano sandwich and fries that is actually quite good $10.20. I take the train back to the hotel and get my bags then go to the airport.

Arrive at HND airport with ¥153 left on my suica card, pretty good! Return my wifi device in the post box, and get through security and customs in like 15 minutes which I'm shocked about. I have ¥1000 in cash left so I get some snacks for the flight and next layover (not paying LAX prices after being here). There is a lack of take away food places, only sit down restaurants or duty free packaged goods. Also lots of luxury shopping, I look at the Tiffany and Bulgari store for fun. I find some vending machines and get salmon onigiri, Pringles, chocolate pretzels, chocolate cookies and a peach tea $6.

Arrive at LAX and go through customs with Global Entry easily then walk to my next gate. I get a PSL at Starbucks, it's $10 for a 12 oz you guys! then flight to PDX. Lyft home $38.31, then cuddle my cat and unpack.

1o1mizc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1mizc,"This is going to be long so grab a cup of coffee/tea, plug in the phone charger and up the screen brightness. A sum-up of all our collective feelings (for most of us atleast)","Amal & bully gang stans, this might be equal to sunlight + garlic + the holy cross, for the vampire in you

Imagine you're wearing a long fur coat/bathrobe, someone's borrowed tinted sunglasses which are way too big for your face, putting on a poker expression, and you plonk yourself next to a working kitchen stove. Someone tells you not once, not twice, but thrice, to please get down from the counter for your own safety as well as general etiquette, and only then do you obey in your disobedience. Then someone's teaching you how to go about a task in the kitchen but you're posing in the mirror, putting up punk rock signs in the air, with your hand on the shoulder of a man (Baseer) you nominated, completely ignoring the person trying to teach you. Wouldn't you think you are an ass for being this way? Well, that is Malti for you. 

We all rejoiced when she took down Tanya (quite literally) and I remember seeing posts calling Malti their new favourite, but I know that is too early to judge someone in this house. Mehndi on a woman's palms too takes a day or two to get richer and darker in color. So Malti's personality was bound to take time to come out. And she has come out tailor made and perfect for ZQ, Amal, Baaz. Malti is a pump for ZQ for he actually feels that this woman is taking more of an active part in planning than Amal and Baaz who spend most of their time in shenanigans. 

I think Neelam summed it up well. ""Aise ghum Rahi hai, lamba coat, chashma, hair band lagake, jaise london main ghum rahi hai."" Malti is acting very chic, posh, and suave but she dropped all of that when she dropped kneading the dough for it was too tiring for her. And rightly so, the whole house except the obvious pollutants, mounted an attack on her. 

For Tanya, there is no hope. After having heard words like ""dafa ho"" from ZQ, swearing she won't speak to him, today she held his hand, with dewy eyes, like a daasi at a king's court waiting for his stamp of approval, only further feeding ZQ's ego. She has sucked up to the bullies before, and she will until she goes out of the house.

Neelam is a curious but also an easy case to crack. Sitting in their hibernating cave, with Tanya, Neelam will often start a conversation about how she's upset with ZQ, Amal, Baaz etc but she'll always, religiously, like a cat never forgetting to clean after herself, end her criticism of them with sweet, understanding words like, ""Par kya kar sakte hain"", ""Woh bhi apna game khel rahe hain"", ""Aadmi ache hain, bas kabhi kabhi gussa aa jata hai inpar"". She is like a tubelight that comes close to lighting up the room, giving you hope, but always leaves you in the darkness looking for a candle instead.

Baaz is a misstep in evolution. While most of evolved, our brains got bigger, complex, developed, he might have been left behind. But his is a tragic case. Beneath the loud jokes that make worse landings than planes in Delhi's smog, he knows that being a clown is his only and last chance to be seen. Deep down he knows he wouldn't be here without his sister, that the world sees him that way, that he doesn't have the best of raw skills, so he has to make up for all these losses. His crass humour is actually his coping mechanism. He was, is and always will be a filler who likes to ride high on the the toxic Indian male persona, of I'll-beat-you-up-outside and I-take-stand-for-women while speaking to women like shit at the same time. But he is the one who has spoiled the broth for many, like Amal, ZQ, Baseer. They have all gotten on his carriage of humour only to later find out the carriage is being pulled by horses who can't see and will soon drive them into a ditch.

ZQ aka Dhanbad ka Pacino acts the most effortless but is putting in the most effort. A big reason behind that is the Napoleon-complex-coded mentality where he has to be the leader of the pack or he will definitely get lost. Do you remember the day he returned the eggs to Ashnoor, leading to a fall out with Amal-Baaz and then announcing his retirement from the group, his plan to play by himself, work out, sit in corners etc? That didn't last one whole day! Not one day! Validation is more important to ZQ than anyone else in this house, it's his O2, his sweet, sweet high, his shot in the arm of naughty substances. But ZQ will soon fall, he will crash and that might just be because of his loud proclaimation of being a mastermind. Baseer, Baaz, Amal also tend to follow him partly due to his age. His ego of being called the mastermind will prick them one fine morning and that sunrise will bring ZQ's sunset.

Amal. Where can we begin? Drinks water straight from the common water tube, doesn't wash his hands after 30 mins in the bathroom, yells randomly like an unpredictable diwali chakri that blasts and does more than it was supposed to do, calls himself a gunda but didn't have the bloody balls to take the heat during the prank-gone-wrong moment, is coddled and sucked hard during wkvs where he sits with his mouth wide open like a baby waiting to be fed his Cerelac, certainly has the air of superiority bcz bird brains like Neelam, Tanya, Malti wander around him for reasons only Malti's astrology can explain, etc. There's so much to unpack about this box of filth, I'll need gloves, microscopes, sanitisers, and equipment because I really, really don't wanna get my hands dirty.

Just to put this into perspective for you - Imagine a woman/man/non-binary person pays you a compliment. That does good to your heart, your soul and does naturally give you a spring in your step, enlarges your pupils, broadens your chest and you feel better. Your ego, even if you were dead humble, gets a small jump, a baby lift, if you may. Now imagine someone telling you, your heart is the most beautiful in the world, your heart is the reason everyone else's heart beats, you are the purest soul to have ever taken birth! You will either feel, ""Man! What sorcery is my heart doing? I better get it checked!"" Or you will become so full of yourself, you would give head to yourself. Now just imagine, what is the effect those kind of words will have on a person like Amal, who already has a polar bear sized ego. This is just to give you an idea of the kind of boost that Amal is walking around the house with. It's radioactive-dangerous.

Deep down Baseer wants to play solo. No matter how much he tries, the reality tv game show experienced side of his will triumph over all the group politics, for he believes in competing on the field. He wants to fight shoulder to shoulder but his already formed relations with ZQ and Amal sway him, sometimes for the numbers advantage and sometimes out of brotherly love. If it were upto Baseer, he would be nice to everyone depending on the day and his mood, instead of permanently villanising a whole group of people like his entire gang has done so far.

Pranit, Bajaj, Ashnoor form the main rival gang along with the temporary addition of GK and Mridul. They are temporary because they themselves aren't the biggest fans of Bajaj and Ashnoor but they are a better option than riding the double edged tongues of the bully gang members.

Farhana, Nehal, Kunickaa - are floating voters. They are like bees looking for honey and will choose a flower that suits them the best. The thing is that as other groups try and call them to their side, they ought to be careful for these bees might sting them as well!

P.S. I'm aware of how long this has been. But this is for the readers. And if you have reached till here, let me tell you, you're not just a green flag. You're greener than all the vegan brands out there.

1o1miea,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o1miea/the_night_shift_at_the_diner_pays_400_i_wish_id/,The night shift at the diner pays $400. I wish I'd asked why (Part 1),"Last week, I ran away from home.

At my age, moving out would probably be a more acceptable term. But if you knew anything about my home life, you’d understand that running away is the correct one.

Either way, that’s not important right now. What matters is that I left with only a backpack, the clothes on my back and one extra change, a few days’ worth of food, my phone, and about a thousand dollars in savings, which I’d been quietly stealing from my parents over the past ten years.

And no plan whatsoever.

I hitchhiked to the nearest bus station and bought a ticket for the first bus leaving the state because I didn’t want to give my family enough time to realize that I was gone. When I arrived at my first destination, I took another bus. Then another. And another. Until, finally, I ended up in the middle of nowhere in a small town in Iowa with fewer than four hundred people and one rundown motel that, by some miracle, didn’t ask for an ID or a credit card.

Coming from an overly sheltered life, I had no idea how the real world worked. I still don’t. When I arrived, I thought a thousand dollars, now nine hundred and fifty after the bus fares, was a fortune. That illusion shattered the moment I had to pay for a full week in advance to make up for my lack of credentials.

I soon learned that freedom comes at a steep price, especially when you’re desperate. The man running the motel must’ve sensed it, because on top of the three hundred dollars for the week, he charged me an extra hundred “because you never know with these kids nowadays,” as he put it.

With only five hundred and fifty dollars left, I realized freedom was fleeting. I also realized I needed a job — fast.

And to make matters worse, three days ago, my food finally ran out. So I had no choice but to go to the nearby diner.

I’d never been to a diner before. But from what I’d seen on TV, I could tell that this one looked quite normal: checkered floors, red vinyl chairs, a boombox, and a blonde woman behind the counter refilling a man’s cup with what I believed to be tomato juice from a coffee pitcher.

It was early in the night, and the place was full of people eating and chatting, but all of that came to a stop when I walled in. The tension buildup was instant. Every pair of eyes was turned to me, and the man at the counter even licked his lips like a child presented with a piece of cake. 

I retreated slightly into myself, wishing I could disappear, until the voice of the blonde woman broke the silence. 

“Welcome, dear,” she said. “Sit down anywhere. I’ll be with you in a minute.”

I did what she said and glanced at the menu, trying to make sense of it. With items like ‘bloody scramble’, and ‘organ platter,’ its was hard to find anything that sounded remotely normal, or affordable. My eyes skimmed past ‘heart skewers’ and ‘raw oysters,’ before finally landing on the beef stew, which seemed like a safe choice. 

The waitress, Linda, approached me with a notepad in hand looking so exhausted that she looked like she was starting to blur a bit at the edges.  

“I’d order soon if I were you, darling,” she said, rubbing her temple. “My night girl just quit, and I’ve already worked a double. We’re closing early tonight.”

I perked up at that. 

“Oh no, that’s horrible!” I exclaimed, trying to sound sympathetic. “Does that mean you’re looking for someone to cover the night shift?” I asked, forcing a sweet smile.

The woman could see straight through my act, though. “This isn’t the job for you, dear. Trust me.” She muttered, a flash of worry in her eyes. “Now, can I get you anything, or not?”

“I can do it,” I insisted. “I’ve worked night shift at a diner before.” I smiled, and I hoped she wouldn’t see past my lie. 

She narrowed her eyes and glanced back at the clock behind the counter, and finally sighed in surrender. “If you’re serious, you’d save me a massive headache with my boss. Fine. You can stay. I’ll show you the ropes before I leave—but this is just a trial, understand?” Her tone softened slightly, guilt creeping in.

I nodded eagerly, already half-standing.

She shook her head. “You can still eat first, darling. Your shift doesn’t start till eight.”

And just like that, I had a job, temporary as it might be.

After dinner, Linda took me to the back, where I met Roger, the cook. 

Maybe I should’ve turned around then and there, but I believed Roger to be just a quirky man at first. And, as it may be obvious, I was also in dire need of a job. 

As soon as I walked into the cramped kitchen, the man stopped cooking. He stopped breathing. In fact, he stood deathly still for what felt like an eternity. It wasn’t until Linda introduced us to each other that Roger turned around. 

I forced a smile despite how uncomfortable the interaction had made me feel, and I waved with an expression I hoped came off as friendly. 

He didn’t wave back though. Instead, he stepped closer to me and began sniffing the air around me. I tried to get away from him, but Linda anticipated my actions and smacked the man on the back of the head. 

“Roger! Is that how you treat new coworkers?” Linda chided. 

He stumbled back, rubbing the back of his head. When he wasn’t sniffing me and acting like a pervert, he looked like a perfectly normal man in his late twenties. He didn’t say anything for a few seconds, and neither did I, but at least he had the decency to look apologetic. 

Linda sighed. “Roger, boy. Aren’t you going to apologize to Susan?”

“Sorry!” He exclaimed immediately, and the innocence with which he did it made me feel bad for him. He almost looked like a kicked puppy. “But—”

“Now,” the woman interrupted. “As I was saying before you started being rude. This is Susan, and she will be working the night shift with you tonight. Keep an eye on her, alright dear?”

“Yes, ma’am,” he nodded. 

“Good. Now come on, darling. I’ve got a uniform for you,” she said to me.

I did as she commanded. Linda led me to a small storage room located at the very end of the kitchen, and handed me a faded pink dress and a white apron with ruffles.

I put them on, feeling ridiculous, but the worst part was the hat. I couldn’t help but think that I looked a lot like a waitress from a cartoon. 

Still, as I caught my reflection in the small cracked mirror, I couldn’t help the faint smile tugging at my lips. For the first time, I felt like I was doing something on my own. Earning something. It felt like triumph. 

That brief spark of pride lasted exactly three minutes, though.

Out in the diner, the man who’d stared at me earlier tapped his cup against the counter in a crass attempt to get Linda’s attention. 

She sighed and reached for a pitcher, the one she was holding when I came in earlier. She bagan pouring the thick red liquid that at first glance I believed to be tomato juice. But now, standing close enough to smell the hot liquid, I caught the unmistakable metallic stench of blood. 

My throat went dry.

“This part’s easy, darling” Linda said in her usual cheery tone, as if she were teaching me how to brew coffee. She set the pitcher down on a heated rack beside five others I hadn’t noticed before. “You have to keep the pitchers on the warmer. Nobody likes room temperature blood. But do make sure it doesn’t get over 100 degrees. It starts tasting foul not too long after that. Now, they go in order: A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, and if someone asks for AB, just do half and half. Easy, right?”

She turned and smiled at me, waiting for a response.

I just stared. “You—you’re kidding, right?”

“Don’t worry, dear, you’ll get the hang of it.” She moved on to the pastry shelf, still speaking like nothing was wrong. “We keep the blood bags in the back. Just pour a new one in when you run out. The type’s labeled, so you won’t mix them up.”

My stomach lurched, and the air suddenly felt too thick to breathe.

*What did I get myself into?* I thought, backing away under the amused gaze of the rude man at the counter.

Linda kept talking, her back still to me. “Now, all the pastries are labeled, so you just hand the right one to the customer, and since you said that you have experience I’m sure you can handle taking orders. Everything else works just like at any other din—” She turned around mid-sentence and stopped when she saw me edging toward the door.

For a moment, something like disappointment flickered across her face. Then she smiled again, softer now, almost pitying.

“You can walk out that door right now, Susan dear. I’m not keeping you here against your will,” she said, her voice calm. “But when you agreed to work here tonight, a promise was made. And we take promises very seriously.”

The sweetness in her tone soured into something sharp. “So you can stay and finish your shift, or you can leave and pray that nobody here heard you break your word.”

My hands started shaking, and the man—not a man?—at the counter was still looking at me like he was about to burst laughing any minute now. 

Linda placed her hands gently on my shoulders. “You’ll be safe here, as long as you do what you said you’d do, darling.” She smiled kindly again, and that felt like the most unsettling part of all. 

“Now—” she glanced at the clock, which marked eight o’clock—“I have to go. I can’t stay in this plane any longer, but I hope to see you when I come to relieve you at four.”

I blinked, not understanding.

She gave me a quick hug, then her edges began to blur again, followed by the rest of her until there was nothing left at all.

I stifled a scream, my head whipping around to see if anyone else had noticed that the woman standing in front of me had just disappeared. But, of course, everybody else was only focused on their own meals and their own conversations, paying no attention to what I now assumed to be a completely normal and usual occurrence. 

However, there was one person who was not minding their own business. The rude man at the counter, whose grin only widened even further when he felt my alarmed gaze. 

“Are you on the menu too, sweetheart?” He purred, barking a laugh at the sheer terror on my face. I felt my insides liquify for a second, and for a moment I my body became paralyzed with fear. The stranger rolled his eyes. “It’s no fun when you just freeze—“  he pouted. “Just get me another cup of O-. And do hurry up.”

I shuddered, but still did what he told me. 

My hands trembled as I reached for the pitcher. It felt warm in my hands, but that still did nothing to ease the shaking. I made my best effort not to look at the contents or even gag at the stench, as now that I knew what it really was it made my stomach churn uncontrollably. 

I focused solely on pouring the drink. Somehow, miraculously, not a single drop spilled. 

He snatched it off the counter before I could even set the pitcher down. The motion was so fast that it made me flinch, and the pitcher slipped from my hands. It shattered against the floor, splashing a deep, ugly crimson across the pristine white of my shoes.

I took a deep breath and stifled yet another scream. 

“Always so jumpy,” The man mocked. “To your last—” He paused, chuckling. “Sorry. To your first night.” He raised his glass in a mock toast and drained it in one long gulp.

I couldn’t stop staring at my shoes, and the deep red stain blooming across the floor. 

He tossed a stack of crumpled one-dollar bills onto the counter and stood. “Gotta go. See you later, Bloody.” He grinned again, winking. But this time, he made sure that I could see the unnaturally elongated canines sitting in his mouth. Making a show out of it just for his own amusement. 

When I finally dared to look up again, Roger was standing beside me with a mop and broom. I hadn’t even heard him come in.

“Don’t mind him. He’s always an asshole.” He gave me a light pat on the back, and I flinched so hard the mop handle clattered against the counter.

By then, I’d already realized that none of these people were human. The thought of one of them touching me made every nerve in my body recoil. The word predator echoed through my mind, over and over.

His expression softened and he took one step back. At least he didn’t seem offended—or pleased like the vampire   “It’s ok. Just go change. I’ll clean up here.”

I managed a shaky nod and stumbled toward the back room. Inside, I found another uniform in the same closet where I’d seen Linda go before. I changed quickly, though my fingers wouldn’t stop trembling, and by the time I worked up the courage to return, the floor was spotless, the air heavy with bleach, and Roger was calmly filling a new pitcher of O-.

“Thank you,” I managed to say, my voice barely a whisper. I was still terrified of the cook, but a part of me was profoundly relieved not to be alone. Also, he hadn’t really done anything to warrant my terror just yet.

Besides, we all know the saying. Better the devil you know than the angel you don’t. Not that I really knew Roger though. 

He glanced up to meet my gaze and gave me a small, reassuring smile. “You’ll get used to this in no time,” he said.

I wasn’t sure how confident I was in his statement, though. But I nodded regardless.

Still, as the night wore on, I did fall into a rhythm. A customer would come in, I’d take their order, and I’d try not to think too much about what they were. At first, I tried to guess based on what they ordered, but I quickly realized it was better not to know. It was better to treat them as If they were just human customers in a normal human diner. 

Not that it was easy. Especially when I found out that ‘heart skewers’ meant literal raw hearts on a skewer. At least they were squirrel hearts and not human. Still made me gag. 

By the time three a.m. came and nothing disastrous had happened, I started to relax. The end was finally in sight. Just one more hour, I told myself. One more hour, and I’d walk out of this nightmare. 

But fate had other plans. 

A few minutes before four, a new vampire walked in through the door. It was impossible to deny what he was while he was flashing those canines. 

“I thought this place would be closed tonight. I would’ve come earlier if I knew it wasn’t.” He said, a smug expression on his face. Then his eyes landed on me. “Well, well, well. What do we have here? A last-minute snack? Linda has more tricks up her sleeve than I imagined.

He took a step forward, but from the kitchen doorway came a low, warning growl. Suddenly, Roger grabbed me by the shoulder and shoved me into the kitchen.

“You’re not welcome here.” He kept growling, claws emerging from his nails. “And you already know that.

He threw his hands up. “Oh, come on!” He exclaimed. “She made a promise and then she broke it. You should really learn some things from me, wolfie. Promises are everything—not that you would know much about that. Now, just pour me a cup of AB+ and I’ll be on my way. Come on. I won’t even eat the new girl unless she lets me” He flashed me a teethed grin, making me shudder.

“That’s quite enough, Silas.”

Linda stood by the blood station, having simply appeared. I didn't have the energy to even flinch at it. “You know the rules. You prey on my staff, you lose your dining privileges. Permanently.”

The vampire, Silas, took a step back, his hands raised. “The last girl on night shift broke a promise, Linda. We all know how that goes,” he shrugged. “It’s quite simple, really—”

“It never is with you.” Her voice was flat. “Out. You and your kind are not very keen on consequences except for when they benefit you. Now they benefit me. Out right now.”

With a venomous glare Silas turned and went back out the door, slamming it against the frame. 

Linda’s shoulders slumped, the immense power draining from her as she turned to me. “Good job, dear. See? I would you it would be just fine.” She smiled with that sweet smile from before. “You did well. For a first night.”

“Can I go now?” I whispered, desperate to get out of there. 

“Sure, dear. Don’t you want to stay for breakfast, though?”

No. I didn’t. I didn’t need to be told twice. I didn’t even respond to her question. I just took the apron off and I ran out the door, intending to get my things and leave the dammed town behind. I didn’t even think about payment or how I would live after that. Only about survival. 

I was running so fast, my lungs burning in the cold air, that I didn't realize I wasn't alone until I hit a solid wall. Or what felt like a solid wall.

It was Silas.

His hands shot out, gripping my upper arms forcefully in order to hold me in place with effortless strength. I tried to struggle against his grip, but he was too strong. 

""Leaving so soon?"" he purred, his voice a mockery of concern. ""And without serving me my AB+? That's terribly poor form for a waitress.

I tried to struggle again, but it was like trying to move stone. ""Let me go!""

""Tsk-tsk,"" he chided, his face inches from mine.

""We need to have a little chat about promises. You see, when you agreed to work the night shift at the diner, you entered into a spoken contract. An implicit promise to serve all the customers who walked through that door.” He began walking, forcing me backward with him, steering me effortlessly away from the main road and into the deep shadows between two darkened buildings.

""You might recall,"" he continued, ""that I politely placed an order. And you refused to fulfill it.” He smiled maniacally. “You broke a promise and I am happy to make you pay for it.”

My back hit the cold brick wall of the alley. There was nowhere left to go. I remember having the distinct certainty that I was going to die without ever having lived a day in my life. 

""So you see, my dear,"" Silas whispered, one cold hand coming up to cradle my jaw, his thumb stroking my throat. ""This isn't malice. This is simply accountability. A balancing of the scales. You owe us all debt, even if the losers at the diner don’t see it the same way I do.”

He pulled back just enough to look into my eyes, his own gleaming with a horrifying delight. He was savoring this, drawing out every second of my terror.

""Any last words?"" he asked. His gaze dropped to the pulse hammering in my neck, and his canines began to elongate.

A screech erupted from my throat as blinding pain exploded in my neck. I tried to push him off me. I knew that I was going to die, but I wasn’t about to make it easy for him. 

I started to feel weak, drained. He was drinking from me in large gulps, all of which sent a wave of pain down my whole body. Then the pain got worse. 

Not because he became more forceful, but because he was torn off my neck. I could barely see through the tears. It was still dark and the haze brought on by pain, fear, and weakness made me believe that I was hallucinating. But it was real. 

Somebody—something—had slammed Silas’ body off mine, and they were fighting. I couldn’t see who was winning, or even who my savior was. Was it Roger? Linda?

It didn’t take long for me to find all of that out, because dawn was on the horizon. Through the first rays of sunlight of the day I could see the rude vampire from earlier pinning Silas to the ground. 

He lost his grip for a second, and Silas took that as an opportunity to leap back to me, shoving his fangs once more into my flesh, this time on my leg. The other vampire grabbed Silas again, tearing him off me and leaving me with an open wound from halfway up my calf to almost the top of my ankle. 

“Sire—” Silas started, but the rude customer picked him up by the collar and slammed him back to the ground. “I thought we’d discussed this, Silas. You weren’t supposed to draw more attention to us like this. Especially not after last night!” He roared. Silas tried to speak again, but his words died in his throat and were instead replaced by a screech of pain when his right arm was torn off the socket. 

I made a sound of pure terror, trying unsuccessfully to melt into the wall behind me. Unable to get up and run for my life. 

The man still standing placed a foot on Silas’ chest, and methodically started pulling at his left leg. Slowly and torturously until it also came off the vampire whining in agony. I couldn’t keep looking, too busy vomiting every last ounce of substance in my body. I closed my eyes, praying that death would take me before the rude customer could get to me himself. 

One more ripping sound followed by a scream let me know that his other leg had also come off. And finally, a second ripping sound followed by no noise. Only then I dared to open my eyes, and I was greeted by the sight of torn off limbs and a decapitated torso. 

I wanted to scream, but instead came out a pitying sound that I can’t even describe. 

Then his eyes turned to me. 

He took a single, slow step toward me and his shoes made a squelching sound in all the blood, both from mine and Silas’.

I made another pitiful, strangled noise. A sound I didn’t even know I could make. There was nowhere to run, and this vampire had proven to be worse than the last one. I briefly wished Silas had been the one to kill me—at least dismemberment hadn’t seemed to be a part of his modus operandi. But now I was trapped with the much more terrifying one. The vampire that sparked fear even in his own kind. 

He walks even closer, stopping right in front of my paralyzed body. His eyes started tracing the bloody mess Silas had made of my neck and leg. I kept crying as he wordlessly reached over to Silas’s body and wet his hands in his blood before smearing it on both wounds. 

A wave of shock coursed through me as the long gashes faded into smaller bite wounds, still bleeding and still painful, but nos as grave as before. 

A slow, dark smile spread on his face. ""Looks like you really are on the menu after all, Bloody,” he said, and then he laughed. His fangs elongated as well, and I began whimpering again. But I didn’t have any more strength left to fight back. 

“Don’t worry,” he purred. “I’m not going to bleed you dry. That would be… wasteful. And now you owe me for saving your life. I plan on cashing in that debt in the future.”

He grabbed me by my hair and pulled my neck towards his mouth, lowering until his fangs tickled my raw flesh. 

“No. Please…” I whimpered. 

“Shhh…” he whispered against my neck, sending a shiver down my spine. 

He slowly pushed the fangs in, holding me steady with an iron clad grip. It hurt, a lot. But it wasn’t as forceful or as bad as Silas’ bite. Still I screamed, but it didn’t help ease the pain. 

Soon after a fog took over my mind and I must’ve passed out because the next thing I knew was that I woke up lying on the coarse carped of my motel room. In horrible pain and after over twenty four hours since my shift at the diner ended. 

My neck and my leg were bandaged, and that realization brought all the memories from that alley back like a tsunami. 

Through labored breathing, I got up and opened the door to the motel, intending to flee town as soon as possible. But my exit route was blocked. 

Sitting neatly on the worn welcome mat was a small cardboard box. On top of it lay a plain white envelope. I snatched it inside, and I locked the door again.

The envelope was heavy and when I opened it it contained four one hundred dollar bills and a note. 

*Dear Susan,*

*Roger went to see you this morning to give you your pay for last night, but he found you wounded on the floor.*

*He cleaned your wounds and I made him bring you some food for later. You’re going to need it. I hope the chicken soup helps you feel better.* 

*PD. If you still want the job, come by the diner whenever you want. I do still need a new night shift girl.  The pay remains the same, four hundred dollars per night.*  

*Love, Linda.* 

I stared at the money for a good few minutes before putting it with the rest. I made 400 dollars in one night. 

I’m more calm now, and I was able to think my escape plan through. 

The next bus out of town won’t be here for a few more days, and I definitely can’t escape on foot. This town is too far away from civilization. 

I still don’t know what Im going to do. For now I plan on staying in this room until I can actually leave. Roger has come over a few times, always with food from the diner, but I didn’t acknowledge him even once. 

All I want is to put this nightmare behind me. 

Especially the strange vampire that saved me. He says I owe him now, but I don’t think that I want to know what owing a vampire anything means. Maybe if I run, he won’t find me. 

I’m writing this as a warning for every single one of you out there. 

If you ever find yourself in a town in the middle of nowhere, do not go to the diner. 

And definitely don’t make promises you can’t keep. ",7,1759955566.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

STAND USER: Tommaso D. Cash
INSPIRATION: Espresso Macchiato (Song by Tommy Cash, Estonia Entry for Eurovision 2025 Basel)
STAND APPEARANCE: A white coffee-cup with a strange Fedora Hat and stick-figure-like appendages sticking out of its body.

ABILITY: A Stand bound to a Paper Coffee Cup, it becomes a Sentient Stand once the user or any applicable stand user drinks out of it. While near the stand, it possesses the ability to manipulate any Caffiene from anywhere in a radius that is determined by the stand. This kind of ability can be utilized in a number of fashions, from increasing the effects of Caffiene, to reshaping Caffiene-based products in various ways. Various manners will require the user to be Hands-On. And other times, will require the user to just look in the direction of its intended target. It is left to the user to find unique ways of utilizing this ability. Do note that anyone that comes into possession with the stand can use its ability, not just the original stand user.

The stand will start off as a bound stand with no unique ability, to unlock its ability, it must be in its sentient form. The stand will start off as cocky and pretentious, oftentimes wanting to demonstrate its power. The stand, as mentioned earlier, determines what the range of its ability will be. The stand can be negotiated with, but only if it is actively used as a coffee cup. The minimum range is 2.5 meters, and the maximum range is 25 meters. A stand user that has a better relationship with this stand will often get better range, but a poor relationship may result in shorter ranges, and in the worst-case scenario, the stand not appearing at all.

1o1mb4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1o1mb4o/i_need_a_better_morning_routine_to_relieve_allday/,I need a better morning routine to relieve all-day anxiety.,"I'm trying different natural things for my day-long anxiety spikes, but I need to do more in the first few minutes I wake up, because I'm sure if I had a better morning routine my day would be a bit less stressful and panicky.

I don’t take any medication btw, so I start with a short 10-15 minute meditation right after waking up, then a quick stretch and some exercise, some basic things my last trainer taught me. It's just enough to get my blood moving basically.

There's also a cup of chamomile or lemon balm tea, and I avoid coffee as much as possible, but even if I get one, that's in the evening.

I also take a [Calmee](https://extracted.co.uk/products/calmee) pill if anxiety spikes later, it's a supplement (not drug) and it usually kicks in within 20 minutes and helps me reset a bit.

BUT I'd prefer it if I didn't come to having a ""spike"" at all, so it all goes back to the morning routine. Basically - I need to add things to my routine to be the least anxious I can be during the day. Any kind of food, drinks, exercise, habits you can recommend - I'll try it!  ",2,1759955105.0,mentalhealth,0,0.76,False

There are no modern gas station/convenience stores like WaWa, Buckee's, or Royal Farms... No 24/7 Diners like Waffle House, or novelty (less expensive) restaurants like Cracker Barrel, Very few ""destination"" restaurants, No great Jamaican, Ramen, Pho, & Sushi spots, Very few new drive throughs... 

The area is dominated by old & overpriced Exxon, BP, & Shell gas stations for some strange reason, and most of them are ""sore eyesight-hole in the wall ancient"" spots, no all night deli, public restrooms, nor even a decent coffee stand for ages... Rather sad.

Aspen Hill literally got a Starbucks months ago (after years of not having one) and now it's closing... Sure there's Dunkin across the street, but a Mom & Pop bakery is what the area really needs most in my opinion. 

Glenmont shopping center is ancient, blighted, and quite dilapidated, mostly a truck parking lot at night... I want to make it clear though, we don't need Rockville Town Center with all the parking meters, but a firm update should have at least happened there and in Wheaton maybe 20 years ago. Twinbrook as well can be added to the list too, another place built around a boarded-up bowling alley.

This area has some of the most affordable & spacious housing in the North East, plenty of diversity, it's close to DC, good modern schools, great parks, and plenty of underdeveloped land... At some point all the developers that filed plans and the ppl that approved them need to be held to account.

I don't want it all to turn into big city mind you, but I felt it would be interesting to see what people think about why this area has been neglected (redlined almost) by highly useful (more modern) restaurants & businesses? 

Neighborhoods I've observed in places like Hawaii had far more variety, evolution, and cleanliness in terms of business than what I've seen in this region sitting around for ages.",0,1759955101.0,SilverSpring,50,0.5,False

The Archivist lets out another sigh, this one full of a deep exhaustion.* Sasha and Tim cannot return soon enough. Ahem. Statement of Charles Monk regarding a phone book. Original statement given July 6th, 2010. Recorded by Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. Statement begins.

Have you ever seen a phone book in a used bookshop? Or even a library? I sure hadn't. That's why I was so shocked when I was browsing this little corner shop, Nook 'n' Cranny or something like that, and saw a phone book for sale. Some place in the States called Aurora. I flipped it open for a laugh and saw something stamped on the inside of the cover. ""From the Library of Jurgen Leitner."" I mean, who keeps a phone book in their private library? Was about to put it back but decided what the hell? It was only 99p and would be a great coffee table book. A Brit with an outdated Yank phone book? Can't make that up if you tried. The cashier looked confused when I brought it up to the till and I was scared she wouldn't sell it to me. Then she shrugged and off I went, prize in hand. Went home and flipped through it before I went out for the night. Not really much to say about it, it’s a phone book. When the sun finally set I put the book down and got ready to go out. I've been in a bit of a dry spell lately, and I was looking on fixing that tonight. At around midnight I ended up at some club called the Neon Wave. It's what you would expect. I already had a few drinks in me and was feeling good, but what's wrong with feeling even better? I made my way to the bar and ordered another. While I waited for it to be made, my eyes met with another. She was gorgeous. Long blonde hair and clothes that were more string than actual fabric. Face covered in thick makeup, she looked like a fun time. Not necessarily someone to bring home to my parents, but look I didn't say I was looking for my wife, just a quick lay. After I downed my drink I made my way over to her. I'll spare you the details, but after some dancing I went to get her number. She gave me a phone number alright, just not hers. I knew it. Not in a ""Oh I'm sure it's not her real number,"" but I knew it for a fact. I even knew which digit wasn't right. In fact, I even knew what it was supposed to be. I didn't say anything. Why would I? It would only cause a scene and let's face it, I was drunk. I probably imagined the whole thing. Needless to say I went home alone and woke up with a killer hangover. I barely remembered the girl until I saw a number written on my hand. The fake number. I dialed it and received a ""The number you are trying to reach is no longer in service."" message. Like I expected. Then I dialed the number I knew was correct. After a few moments of ringing, someone had picked up. ""Ello?"" was all she got out before I hung up. I wasn't imagining it. I knew her number, I don't know how but I did. I dialed again. ""Ello? Who is this?"" I almost hung up again out of fear but I fought through the impulse. ""Hey, it's Charlie from last night. Just called to make sure you made it home okay."" She was silent for a bit. I thought the call cut but then she spoke again. ""Oh yeah, thanks for checking but I've got to go."" The call ended quickly. The fear in her voice was unmistakable. I guess I could understand why she was scared, but come on I was calling to check on her. That's a good thing! It's amazing what you can find from someone's number. In less than an hour I had found her socials and not long after that I found where she worked. Some nothing coffee shop. And let me tell you, I could go for a cup after the previous night's activities. I get a cab, a small quiet man driving it. He had three different phone numbers. Presumably a cell, work and a secret, hidden one. Something he didn't want the missus to know about. It didn't take long to get there, could very easily start walking there, once me and her really hit it off. He asked for the fare. I told him the hidden number and suddenly the ride was free of charge.

It was a cozy shop. Not too many customers at this hour. I suppose the early bird only gets the worm on the weekdays.

And there she was, standing behind the counter. The lighting, or lack thereof, in the club certainly did her wonders, but I was already here. She seemed confused by my wide smile as I ordered. Evidently the lighting didn't help me and she simply forgot what I looked like. It wasn't until I gave her my name that she realized who I was. And she screamed! She was terrified! I put my hand out to reassure her and she slapped it away. Now, even on a bad day I'm a reasonable guy, but I thought this was way past rude and asked to speak to her manager. She didn't even acknowledge my request, instead she started to back up and then she ran! She actually ran! I couldn't believe it. Such a gross overreaction, and she didn't even give me the courtesy of letting me explain myself. I left through the front door to see if I could catch up to her, and I almost did. That is, until she saw me again and ran across the street. She was so focused on getting away from me she didn't see the bus coming. I heard someone shouting to call the police and I had to fight a laugh. That's one number everyone knows, so I left it for someone else to dial. It really was a quick walk back to my flat. I did some more digging online, this time on weird stuff. The supernatural and the like. This place came up a bunch. So here I am. More people here than I would've expected. Lots of phone numbers to collect. You can go to the police I suppose, tell them what I've written here. Just remember, you can learn a lot from a phone number.

This went on for 4 years almost everyday until I quit and then started again back in May and I finally realized that I'm going to have to quit one day one way or another because Adderall is simply not a drug.

3 nights in Oxford and 3 nights in London the end of this month. looking for sight seeing / general recommendations for my wife and I. We have quite a bit of open time for the London part of the trip. We’re early 30s, love museums, food, music, and people watching.

Day 2 - 
Coffee at Society 
Harry Potter walking tour 
Possible punting chauffeur depending on weather / timing  
Lunch at Najar’s 
Dinner at Chiang Mai 


Day 3 - 
Coffee at Newground

Head to the Ashmolean 
Dinner at Chester & Arms or Arbequina

Day 7 - depart. 

Let me know any must-do’s while we are in London. Also any help with the public transportation is appreciated. Seems fairly simple but would like some input as it’s a huge part of getting around on this trip. ",1,1759955063.0,travel,4,1.0,False

Greetings! 

I’m here simply hoping to meet someone who also wants to match on an intellectual and emotional level. Having an authentic connection and shared-goals are what’s most important. I’m not against having children, just expanding my horizons to this post in this community to find someone like-minded in terms of taking on life together.

About me: I’m a 28-year-old straight male, located in India, born and raised. I’m of mixed European descent and faith-wise I’m of a Christian background but not a religious person as such. I’m currently still completing my master’s degree, self-employed part-time and applying for work soon, and intend to be fully invested in my work after that for the next few years and decades. I’m 5 feet 8, workout fairly regularly, and I’m health-minded so I don’t smoke, drink, etc.

In terms of hobbies and interests, I usually spend my free time with photography (hoping to get into film-photography soon enough), the cinema, music (so many genres lol), theatre (been to so many operas and ballets in languages I don’t speak), traveling really all the time (mostly the Old World so far), coffee (what’s your go-to favorite coffee order?), books and reading, speaking multiple languages (although English is my native), writing (both as a hobby and officially), comedy (it’s an art-form really), trying out new cuisines, visiting museum’s & galleries, being out in nature, listening to podcasts (mostly history or pop-science related), and more. 

It’s okay if your hobbies and interests are different, that way we’d both be introducing one another to a diverse range of activities and past-times for the rest of our lives. 

I understand the need for space as well, it’s okay to make changes and tune our individual lifestyle presences to vibe together as a couple. I wouldn’t want either of us to plateau, it would be great to live life truly as “partners” in every sense of the word. 

I’m looking for someone to do life with, to go through life’s ups and downs with and someone to grow old together with. I’m open to marriage and open to relocating for or with my future partner. 

I’m rather serious about settling down so not just looking to “date” someone but actively seeking a full-time monogamous relationship. Don’t want to be texting forever, not here looking for a penpal where we would just be light on a screen for each other. If we don’t exist for real together in reality then we’d just be in love with ideas of one another, not our real selves.

Honestly? Just hope that we really like each another and our goals in life are in alignment. 

I believe that not everything has to be perfect, some red flags are expected and as long as we’re willing to work on ourselves, on each other and we’re both willing to put in equal effort into the relationship that’s what matters the most. 

It’s natural to have differences, what’s important is being accepting of our differences and converging our lives paths into one path together.  

Honesty, kindness, trustworthy, a sense of humor are some qualities in a future partner that are most important to me. Someone who means they say, lives up to their words & promises and does no 180’s.

So, yeah... If what you’ve read so far resonates with you, it’d be lovely to hear from you. I’m open to sharing portrait-selfies so we have an idea of who we’re talking to. ",1,1759955036.0,cf4cf,0,0.6,False

The streets are still quiet, and the air carries that early morning calm only Boston knows. For our chauffeurs at Blue Nile Livery, this is when the day truly begins.

# 5:00 AM – The First Glance in the Mirror

Coffee in hand, uniform pressed, shoes polished — it’s not just about appearance. It’s about respect. Every detail reflects the pride our chauffeurs carry into their work. Before a single engine starts, there’s a moment of preparation: reviewing the schedule, checking the vehicle, setting the tone for the day.

# 6:30 AM – The Airport Run

There’s a special satisfaction in being someone’s first experience of the city — greeting a tired traveler, offering a quiet ride, making sure the small things are perfect. Water chilled, phone charger ready, music just right. For many passengers, the [ride from Logan Airport](https://www.bluenilelivery.com/car-services-to-logan-airport/) isn’t just transportation — it’s their first moment to breathe.

# 10:00 AM – The Business Dash

Boston traffic doesn’t forgive mistakes, but precision is our craft. Timing, routes, and communication — all orchestrated perfectly. Our chauffeurs are more than drivers; they’re logistics experts in suits. Whether it’s a meeting in Back Bay or a quick drop in Cambridge, punctuality isn’t a goal — it’s a promise.

# 2:00 PM – A Quiet Hour

Between rides, there’s a pause. Some read, some catch up on the news, others just enjoy a moment of stillness. The cars stay spotless, because presentation is constant — not occasional.

# 4:00 PM – The Celebration Ride

Then come the special moments. A wedding, a prom, a milestone anniversary. Behind the tinted glass, emotions run high — laughter, nervousness, joy. Our chauffeurs witness it all, quietly ensuring everything goes smoothly. They become part of memories, not just miles.

# 9:00 PM – The Reflection

As the city lights glow and the final drop-off wraps up, there’s a quiet sense of pride. It’s not about how many miles were driven — it’s about how many people felt cared for. That’s what Blue Nile Livery stands for: professionalism with heart.

Every day is different, every passenger unique, but one thing remains the same — our chauffeurs carry not just passengers, but trust.

You’re joining a century-old conversation about rebellion and craftsmanship","This [**Harley-Davidson Logo**](https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/index.html) **Vinyl Sticker** isn’t just a decal — it’s a piece of Americana, a symbol of freedom, grit, and just a little bit of noise pollution. Perfect for your bike, helmet, toolbox, laptop, or garage wall shrine, it declares what thousands of riders have known since 1903: [**Harley-Davidson**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson) doesn’t just build motorcycles — it builds attitude.

Made from **high-grade, weatherproof vinyl**, this sticker is printed in full, rich colour using professional solvent-based inks that won’t fade even after years on the open road. The design is **precision-cut** around the classic bar-and-shield logo, creating a clean, bold look that’s as unmistakable as the roar of a V-twin engine. Whether you pick a small 2-inch badge or a massive 29-inch centerpiece, it’s built to last — just like the bikes themselves.

Did you know the company nearly went under in the 1980s until a group of passionate execs bought it back from AMF and revived its reputation? Or that during World War II, Harley supplied the U.S. Army with over 90,000 WLA models — earning it the nickname *“*[**The Liberator**](https://www.theliberator.be/indexmenu.html)*”*? And yes, in 1994, Harley-Davidson actually tried to **trademark the sound** of its engine — a move that sparked debate, laughter, and lawsuits in equal measure. Turns out, you can’t copyright thunder.

So, when you slap this sticker on, you’re not just decorating — you’re joining a century-old conversation about rebellion, craftsmanship, and the open road.

Greetings, fellow coffee lovers! Welcome back to my blog. Today, we're going to talk a little bit about one of my favorite topics: coffee.

I've always made a point of enjoying the good things in life. I've never had any bad habits that were harmful to my health, and I believe that the best way to enjoy my free time and work is with a good cup of coffee. That's why, to celebrate this month dedicated to my favorite drink, I took a tour of some of my favorite coffee shops. Come with me and I'll show you.

by Preston Dennett

Among the many fascinating UFO encounters reported over the last fifty years, those in which UFOs actually land and humanoid beings emerge are particularly compelling. These cases have been documented across the world. The cases presented in this video include the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France, and England. Spanning five decades, these incidents showcase a remarkable variety of humanoid figures and often involve multiple witnesses. Many of the cases include some form of tangible evidence, such as landing traces, unusual animal behavior, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic phenomena, and physiological reactions. In several instances, government involvement is noted, and some witnesses have even reported unsettling threats from mysterious ""men in black.""

July 23, 1947 – Pitanga, Brazil

Jose C. Higgins, a topographer, hears a high-pitched hum before a metallic craft lands nearby. Three beautiful extraterrestrials, dressed in unusual spacesuits, exit the craft and surround him. While initially fearful, Higgins finds the beings friendly and observes them from a distance as they begin to play like small children.

August 1960 – Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia

Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise outside her home. Looking through her window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top land in her backyard. A humanoid in an olive-green jumpsuit exits the craft, climbs over her fence, and approaches her window, leaving her shocked and alarmed.

July 31, 1966 – Presque Isle State Park, Pennsylvania, USA

After their car becomes stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle leaves for help, while Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley, and her two children remain behind. Suddenly, a UFO lands in the adjacent forest. Police arrive and, together with Doug, go to investigate. At that moment, a large, hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Officers from Project Blue Book soon arrive on the scene to conduct an investigation.

August 29, 1967 – Cussac, France

Thirteen-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his nine-year-old sister Ann-Marie are searching for their family’s cows when they encounter a glowing sphere and four small humanoids beneath it. As the children approach for a closer look, the beings notice them and float, one by one, back into their craft.

February 5, 1971 – Kinnula, Finland

Forestry workers Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck are shocked when a UFO lands near their position in the forest. A 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. As the being turns to re-enter the craft, Peter impulsively grabs its foot—a decision he would later regret.

November 14, 1976 – Winchester, England

Joyce Bowles and her friend Edwin Pratt are driving home when they see a UFO descending onto the road ahead. Their car suddenly steers itself off the road. When they come to a stop, they find a UFO blocking their way, with humanoids visible through its windows. One being emerges, approaches them, and stares at them intently, marking the beginning of a bizarre experience.

May 18, 1977 – Elgin, Scotland

Ten-year-old friends Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison hear a soft humming in the woods near their homes and go to investigate. They discover a landed craft and a tall, slender man in a silvery jumpsuit standing beside it. The girls flee as he approaches, seeing the craft take off as they look back. Later, they learn that other witnesses saw the event—and that threats soon followed.

September 18, 1978 – San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy

Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti is enjoying a day of fishing when he hears a strange noise and notices an odd breeze. Investigating, he discovers a landed craft and a surprised humanoid around four feet tall. The being stares at Giorgio before resuming what appears to be repairs on the craft.

November 24, 1978 – Gerena, Spain

Four young men hunting along the Guadiamar River witness strange lights in the forest. They encounter a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid figure. As the figure approaches, the men panic and flee the scene. Later, investigators find unusual traces at the landing site.

July 25, 1981 – Stjordal, Norway

Hjordis Hokstad, hoping to enjoy a morning coffee and watch deer behind her house, instead observes a landed UFO and a humanoid in a spacesuit walking near the craft. Using binoculars, she gets a clear view of the scene, while unbeknownst to her, her neighbor is also witnessing the event from his home.

The overwhelming evidence presented by these cases makes it increasingly difficult to deny the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrial encounters. For those willing to examine the evidence, it is apparent that we are not alone and that the universe may be filled with a diversity of intelligent life forms.

# 💡 What Is ChatGPT Agent Builder?

The **ChatGPT Agent Builder** is OpenAI’s newest feature that lets you create your own AI assistants directly inside ChatGPT.

It’s like having your own digital employee — one that never sleeps, never complains, and never misses a deadline.

You can create an AI that answers customer questions, writes blog posts, manages files, or even connects to apps like Gmail and Zapier.

All it takes is a few clicks and one simple prompt.

# ⚙️ How It Works

You go to [**platform.openai.com/agentbuilder**](https://platform.openai.com/agentbuilder)

You pick a template — like an SEO assistant, customer service bot, or research agent.

You give it instructions like:

>

Then you hit preview, and your new AI assistant is live — chatting, responding, and ready to work.

That’s it.

It’s faster than setting up a spreadsheet and easier than any no-code platform I’ve used.

# 🧠 Why This Matters

Most people spend hours every day doing repetitive work — replying to clients, writing content, sorting files.

**ChatGPT Agent Builder** automates all of that.

You don’t have to be technical. You just describe what you want done.

That’s what makes it powerful.  
It’s AI for real business owners — not just developers.

You can finally turn your ideas into working systems instantly.

# 🚀 What You Can Build in Minutes

Once you try it, the possibilities are endless.

✅ Customer support chatbots that handle FAQs  
✅ SEO assistants that research keywords and write outlines  
✅ Marketing agents that generate captions and post ideas  
✅ Email responders that draft and send follow-ups  
✅ Research bots that summarize long documents

All of this inside ChatGPT — no plugins, no API chaos, no debugging.

# 🪄 The Real Magic: Customization

What makes **ChatGPT Agent Builder** so good isn’t just speed — it’s how flexible it is.

You can customize your prompts so the AI acts exactly how you want.

For example:

>

Now your AI sounds like *you.*

You can even train it using your own business data — so it knows your services, clients, and tone.

This turns it from a generic chatbot into your brand’s personal assistant.

# 💸 The Best Part — It’s Free

During testing, I built over ten agents.  
Guess how much it cost?

Less than one cent.

Right now, **ChatGPT Agent Builder** is free or nearly free to use.  
It’s part of your ChatGPT Plus subscription, with no extra charges.

Compare that to hiring developers or paying for multiple automation tools, and you’ll see why this changes everything.

You can build powerful systems without paying a single dollar more.

# ⚙️ How It Stacks Up Against Paid Tools

Other automation tools charge monthly fees.  
They make you connect dozens of apps just to do one simple task.

With **ChatGPT Agent Builder**, it’s all in one place.

You can:

* Preview your agents in real time
* Adjust prompts instantly
* Add reasoning depth (minimal to high)
* Deploy live with one click

It’s automation made simple — finally.

# 🧱 Example: My “SEO Content Creator” Agent

Here’s a real one I built:

I told ChatGPT Agent Builder,

>

Within seconds, it created a workflow that:

1. Finds trending keywords
2. Builds SEO outlines
3. Suggests meta descriptions
4. Writes a short intro draft

That one agent now saves me an hour a day — every single day.

And I didn’t touch a single line of code.

# 🧩 Small Business Owners Love It

You don’t need a big team to use this.  
You don’t even need a technical background.

If you can describe what you want, you can build it.

That’s why small businesses are switching fast — because now they can automate without hiring developers or buying 10 different apps.

This tool gives you leverage.

Automation used to be hard.  
Now it’s just a chat away.

# ⚠️ A Few Limitations

Like any new feature, there are small issues.

Sometimes app connections through MCP take time to set up.  
Sometimes the AI fetches old results when doing web searches.

But these are small trade-offs for what you get: instant automation that actually works.

And OpenAI updates the builder weekly, so it keeps improving.

# 💬 What’s Next for ChatGPT Agent Builder

OpenAI is turning ChatGPT into a full ecosystem.

Soon you’ll be able to publish your own agents, share them with others, and even monetize them — just like apps on a store.

That means if you create a great automation, you could share or sell it to others.

Imagine building once and earning forever.

That’s where we’re heading — and **ChatGPT Agent Builder** is the first big step.

# 🏁 Final Thoughts

The **ChatGPT Agent Builder** makes creating AI assistants as easy as sending a message.  
It’s free, powerful, and incredibly fast.

If you’re tired of doing the same manual work every day, this is your moment to automate.

Start small — build one assistant that saves you 30 minutes a day.  
Then build another.  
Then another.

Soon you’ll realize your business is running smoother than ever before.

And if you want to skip the setup and copy my pre-built templates, you’ll find them all inside the **AI Profit Boardroom.**
