I’ve been on and off carnivore this past year three times but currently i’m on carnivore a little over 3 months now (started Oct 14, today is Jan 19).

I went from ~96 kg to ~87 kg pretty smoothly in the first 1.5–2 months. Since then, though, my weight has been completely flat. For about 6 weeks now, I haven’t lost or gained a single gram.

⸻

About me / background
	•	Male, 35
	•	~170 cm
	•	No diabetes, no BP issues, non-smoker
	•	Beta thalassemia minor (relevant for iron/ferritin)
	•	Had fatty liver
	•	History of hormonal suppression (low LH) low T

⸻

What I’m eating (very consistent)

My diet is pretty repetitive:
	•	2 coffees daily, each with ~50–70 g butter
	•	One main meal:
	•	Usually ~500 g beef, often cooked in butter
	•	Some days chicken instead
	•	On work days:
	•	6 eggs, boiled or fried in ~50–70 g butter
	•	If I eat eggs, I skip butter in one coffee
	•	Basically zero carbs (only hot sauces and the ocassional pickle 😄)

Also worth mentioning:
I really like hot sauce and use it with almost every beef or chicken meal. I’d estimate ~30–40 ml per day (vinegar-based, zero-calorie type but yes it has some carbs in it anyway).

Calories aren’t tracked, but intake hasn’t really changed during the stall.

⸻

Labs — this is where things get interesting

Before carnivore (right before starting):
	•	ALT: 136 U/L (range 0–41)
	•	AST: 46 U/L (range 0–40)
	•	Diagnosed fatty liver
	•	LH ~1.3
	•	Ferritin historically high and always climbing
	•	Highest ferritin I ever recorded was ~360

This was literally right before I started carnivore.

⸻

Recent labs (this month):
	•	ALT: 28
	•	AST: 23
	•	LH: 3.8
	•	Estradiol: 17
	•	Sodium: 138
	•	Potassium: 5.4
	•	Magnesium: 2.1
	•	Kidney markers normal, albumin/creatinine ratio normal

And the biggest surprise:
	•	Ferritin went from ~290 last month → 233 now

That has never happened in my life. Even after blood donation in the past, ferritin usually just kept creeping up. I’ve been blocking iron absorption (coffee + calcium with meals), and inflammation seems much lower overall.

⸻

Where I’m confused

So now I’m here:
	•	Weight hasn’t moved for ~6 weeks
	•	But liver enzymes normalized
	•	Hormones improved
	•	Ferritin dropped significantly
	•	Energy is okay, no major symptoms (but really never got that keto high or super energy thing at all)
i dont feel energetic enough to workout as i did before. And i do get hungry often, i feel like maybe im not in deep ketosis?

It feels strange to see all these internal improvements while the scale just refuses to move.

⸻

My questions
	•	Is this kind of long stall after rapid early weight loss normal on carnivore?
	•	Has anyone seen health markers improve while bodyweight stays flat?
	•	For people who broke a stall:
	•	Did adjusting fat vs protein help?
	•	Did you eventually need to track calories?
	•	And for anyone with iron issues / thalassemia trait — did ferritin start dropping once inflammation and absorption were controlled?

I’m not trying to panic or quit — just trying to understand whether this is normal adaptation or if I should tweak something.

Appreciate any thoughtful input.

Give me a gym, a whistle, and kids who are allowed to run, and everything makes sense. Take all that energy and squeeze it into narrow school corridors between classes, and suddenly it’s chaos. Last week I got a perfect example of that. We were transitioning from locker rooms back to class. I told them, very clearly, no running, no games, just walk it out. I even did the whole serious teacher voice. I turn around for maybe a minute to talk to another teacher about a schedule mix up. That was all it took. When I turned back, I saw two boys doing that very specific crouched posture that means they’re about to sprint. Before I could even open my mouth, they took off, weaving around lockers, laughing like they’d just invented running itself. One kid zigged, the other zagged, and at the exact wrong moment our assistant principal came around the corner holding a stack of papers and a coffee.

It happened in slow motion. One student tried to stop, slipped a little, bumped the other kid, and together they clipped the assistant principal right at the knees. Papers everywhere. Coffee airborne. The kids froze. I froze. The hallway went silent in that shocked way where everyone is pretending they didn’t just see what they absolutely saw. To her credit, the assistant principal wasn’t hurt. She sat there for a second, looked at the ceiling, then started laughing. Full on laughing. The kids looked like they were about to cry, apologize, and disappear into the floor all at once. I helped her up, handed her what used to be organized paperwork, and she just said, still smiling, “I guess this is why we say no running.” Later that day, the story spread faster than the kids ever ran. I got jokes about teaching tackle drills in the hall. The students learned a lesson. I learned that PE energy does not turn off at the gym doors, no matter how many times I say it.

The living room isn't just a space; it's the heart of your home. It's where memories are made, stories are shared, and comfort reigns supreme. But transforming it into a haven that reflects your personality and meets your needs can sometimes feel like a daunting task. Fear not! We're here to spark your imagination with a wealth of interior design ideas for your living room, ensuring it’s both beautiful and functional.

**Embrace Your Inner Designer: Finding Your Living Room Style**

Before diving into specific elements, consider what feeling you want your living room to evoke. Do you dream of a cozy, rustic retreat, a sleek modern sanctuary, or a vibrant, eclectic gathering space?

* **Modern Minimalism:** Think clean lines, neutral palettes, and intentional furniture choices. Less is more here, focusing on quality over quantity. This style often features statement lighting and subtly textured fabrics.
* **Bohemian Bliss:** Layer textures, patterns, and global influences. Incorporate natural materials like rattan and macrame, add an abundance of plants, and don't shy away from vibrant colors and unique artisanal pieces.
* **Classic Elegance:** Timeless furniture, rich fabrics, sophisticated color schemes, and ornate details characterize this style. Think plush velvet sofas, intricate chandeliers, and polished wood.
* **Industrial Chic:** Exposed brick, metal accents, concrete elements, and reclaimed wood define this urban-inspired look. It’s about celebrating raw materials and a slightly edgy aesthetic.
* **Scandinavian Serenity:** Light wood, crisp whites, cozy textiles, and a focus on natural light create a calm and inviting atmosphere. Functionality and simplicity are key.

**Key Elements for a Breathtaking Living Room**

Once you have a style in mind, let's break down the components that bring it to life:

1. **Furniture that Speaks Volumes:** The sofa is often the anchor of the living room. Choose one that's not only comfortable but also proportionate to your space. Consider accent chairs, coffee tables, and side tables that complement your chosen style and offer practical solutions. *Looking for custom pieces? An* [***experienced interior designer***](https://luxedesignstudio.in/) *can help you find or create the perfect fit.*
2. **Color Palette: The Mood Setter:** Colors have a powerful impact on how a room feels.
   * **Neutrals** (greys, beiges, whites) create a calming backdrop, allowing bolder accents to shine.
   * **Warm tones** (reds, oranges, yellows) add energy and intimacy.
   * **Cool tones** (blues, greens, purples) evoke tranquility and spaciousness.
   * Don't forget the power of **accent walls** to add depth and interest!
3. **Lighting: More Than Just Illumination:** Layered lighting is crucial. Combine ambient (overhead), task (reading lamps), and accent (to highlight art) lighting to create different moods and enhance functionality. A stunning chandelier or unique floor lamp can also serve as a beautiful focal point.
4. **Textiles & Textures: Adding Warmth and Depth:** Rugs, curtains, throw pillows, and blankets are your secret weapons for adding warmth, comfort, and visual interest. Mix different textures – a plush rug, silk curtains, a chunky knit throw – to create a rich, inviting environment.
5. **Art & Decor: The Personal Touch:** This is where your personality truly shines! Curate artwork, photographs, sculptures, and decorative objects that resonate with you. Remember, a few well-chosen pieces are often more impactful than clutter. Consider incorporating plants for a touch of nature and vibrancy.
6. **Optimizing Small Spaces:** Even if your living room is compact, clever design can make it feel expansive. Opt for multi-functional furniture (ottomans with storage, nesting tables), utilize vertical space with shelving, and choose lighter colors to open up the room. Mirrors are also fantastic for reflecting light and creating the illusion of more space.

1qh07zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qh07zp/how_to_effortlessly_charm_anyone_the_psychology/,How to Effortlessly Charm ANYONE: The Psychology Behind Genuine Connection,"I spent months analyzing thousands of social interactions, reading communication psychology research, listening to Charisma on Command breakdowns, and studying behavioral science to figure out why some people just naturally draw others in. And honestly? Most advice about charm is complete garbage. It's either ""smile more!"" or some manipulative pickup artist BS that makes you feel gross.



Here's what nobody tells you: charm isn't about being the loudest person in the room or having perfect one liners. It's about making people feel seen. That's it. When you understand the actual psychology behind human connection instead of trying to fake confidence or memorize scripts, everything shifts. Society constantly pushes this idea that charismatic people are born special, but neuroscience shows us that social skills are literally just patterns you can learn and rewire through practice.



Make people the main character of the conversation. This sounds stupidly simple but most people completely miss it. We're trained to think charm means being interesting, so we jump in with our own stories the second someone mentions something we relate to. That's the opposite of magnetic. Research from Harvard's psychology department found that talking about yourself activates the same pleasure centers as food and money. When you ask genuine questions and actually listen to the answers, you're literally giving someone a dopamine hit. Not surface level ""how was your weekend"" stuff either. If someone mentions they just got back from hiking, don't immediately launch into your hiking story. Ask what trail, what made them pick that one, if they saw anything cool. Let them elaborate. People will remember you as the most interesting person they talked to, even though they did 70% of the talking. Wild how that works.



Stop planning what you'll say next while someone else is talking. I'm calling myself out here too because this is hard to break. But the difference between someone who seems genuinely engaged versus politely waiting their turn is massive. There's this concept in improv comedy called ""yes, and"" where you build on what the other person gives you instead of redirecting. Use that in regular conversation. If someone says they're stressed about a work deadline, don't pivot to your own stress. Build on theirs first. ""That sounds intense, what's the project?"" Let the conversation breathe before you relate it back to yourself, if at all. Your brain will adapt to this style faster than you think once you consciously practice it a few times.



Physical warmth translates to emotional warmth faster than you'd expect. Studies in social psychology journals show that people literally perceive you as warmer personality wise when there's appropriate physical proximity and open body language. Face people fully when they talk, not at an angle. Keep your phone in your pocket. Uncross your arms. Match their energy level, don't bulldoze it. If they're speaking quietly in a coffee shop, don't boom your responses. This mirroring happens naturally with people we vibe with, but you can consciously do it to build rapport faster. Not in a creepy mimicking way, just subtle energy matching. The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down with actual behavioral science instead of feel good fluff. Cabane coached executives at places like Google and she includes practical exercises, not theory. The book completely shifted how I think about presence and warmth as skills rather than personality traits. If you've ever felt invisible in group settings, this book will actually give you a framework that makes sense.



Be comfortable with silence. Anxious people, me included, feel this compulsion to fill every gap in conversation. That energy is palpable and exhausting for everyone involved. Pausing after someone speaks shows you're processing what they said, not just waiting for your turn. It makes your eventual response land with more weight too. Some of the most charismatic people I know will literally just sit there nodding for a second before they respond. That comfort with space signals confidence in a way that rushing never does.



Vulnerability creates connection way faster than perfection. Everyone's walking around trying to seem like they have their shit together, which makes them utterly forgettable. When you can laugh at yourself or admit you're struggling with something, people lean in. Obviously read the room, don't trauma dump on your barista. But in genuine conversations with people you're trying to connect with? Ditch the highlight reel. If someone asks how you are and you're actually stressed about something, it's fine to say that. Not in a complaining way, just honest. ""Honestly been better, dealing with some family stuff but I'm managing. What about you?"" instantly creates more authentic ground than ""Good! You?"" The psychology behind this is called the pratfall effect, where people with high competence become more likeable when they show they're human too.



Remember small details people tell you and bring them up later. This is honestly the most underrated move. Someone mentions their dog's name in passing? Remember it. Ask about the dog by name next time you see them. They mentioned they were nervous about a presentation? Follow up on it afterward. Your brain might resist this at first like ""I can't remember everyone's random details"" but you absolutely can once you start trying.

There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that builds an adaptive learning plan as you go, learning from what resonates with you. The voice options are honestly addictive, you can pick anything from a sarcastic tone to something smooth like Samantha from Her. It's been useful for internalizing concepts from books like The Charisma Myth without having to carve out dedicated reading time.



Stop apologizing for existing. ""Sorry, can I ask you something?"" ""Sorry, just wanted to add..."" Unless you genuinely wronged someone, cut that word from your vocabulary in social settings. It signals that you think your presence or input is an inconvenience. Replace ""sorry I'm late"" with ""thanks for waiting."" Replace ""sorry, one more question"" with ""quick question."" The energy shift is immediate. You're not being rude, you're just not pre-emptively diminishing yourself. Confident people take up space without apology, not in an aggressive way, in a ""I belong here"" way.



Compliment specifics, not generics. ""You're so smart"" does nothing. ""The way you explained that concept made it click for me, I'd been confused about it for weeks"" makes someone feel genuinely seen. Generic compliments feel like small talk. Specific ones show you were paying attention. This goes for appearance too. ""Cool shoes"" is whatever. ""Those Sambas are sick, I love the colorway you picked"" hits different because it's clear you actually looked.



Learning to genuinely charm people isn't about becoming someone else or using tricks. It's about making space for other people while being authentically yourself. The combo of being present, curious, and undefended makes you magnetic without effort. You're not performing, you're connecting. That's the difference between someone people tolerate and someone people actively want to be around.",1,1768816890.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

# The Struggle: A Relatable Pain Point

Let’s be honest: as a veteran player with over a decade under my belt, my biggest fear isn't a complex piece of sheet music—it’s **unpredictable weather**.

We’ve all been there: your guitar feels perfect one night, but after a heavy rainstorm or the first day the heater kicks in during winter, you open your case only to find it **unplayable**. The action is suddenly high enough to drive a train under, or it’s buzzing like crazy on the lower frets. Suddenly, you’re forced to stop being a guitarist and start being a part-time carpenter, reaching for the wrench to crank the truss rod.

I used to think this was just ""wood being wood""—something you had to baby. But eventually, I realized we buy instruments to play, not to serve as full-time caretakers. The moisture and sugars in the wood are the culprits behind its ""mood swings."" If we can permanently lock down those unstable factors, making a new neck behave like a piece of century-old timber, we finally get a true ""productivity tool.""

# The Science: The Essence of the Torrefaction Process

Many beginners assume ""Roasted Maple"" is just a cosmetic choice for a nice caramel color—**that is a complete misconception**. Beyond that faint maple syrup scent, it represents a total ""physical reconstruction.""

Put simply, the wood is placed in a specialized anaerobic kiln at 200°C+ for a process of ""accelerated artificial aging"":

1. **Dehydration (Ending Hygroscopy):** This is the crucial step. It’s like squeezing the water out of a sponge and sealing the pores. Moisture content drops to 4%–7%. Even in humid, tropical environments, the wood simply ""refuses"" to absorb water.

2. **Structural Hardening (Crystallization):** High temperatures cause the cell walls to crystallize. The feel is immediate: while standard maple can feel slightly ""soft,"" roasted maple has a rigid, ""snappy"" resonance when tapped.

3. **Instant ""Vintage"" Vibe (Acoustic Optimization):** New guitars often sound ""tight."" The roasting process simulates the state of wood that has been seasoned for decades. This is why even a brand-new roasted neck has that transparent, ""airy"" resonance.

# Head-to-Head: Buying Guide for Mainstream Roasted Maple Electrics

The market is flooded with ""Roasted Maple"" guitars, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. **The quality variance is significant**, depending on the roasting degree and wood grade. I’ve selected four representative models I’ve spent significant time with for an honest comparison:

|**Metric**|**Fender Am Pro II (Industry Standard)**|**VEAZEN SG30 (The Dark Horse)**|**Suhr Classic S (Boutique Custom)**|**Ibanez AZ Premium (Modern All-Rounder)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

# Common Questions Q&A

**Q: Since it's so good, are there any ""catches""? Is it too brittle to crack?**

**A:** **To be perfectly blunt:** Roasted maple is indeed ""brittler."" It is extremely resistant to warping, but if you drop it or bang it hard, it might chip rather than just denting like standard maple. Also, if you’re into DIY mods, you must be careful when drilling; because the wood is so dry and hard, failing to pre-drill pilot holes can lead to cracks. For normal playing? You're fine—its stability is 50% higher than standard necks.

**Q: Is there a real tonal difference, or is it just ""gear voodoo""?**

**A:** It’s definitely not voodoo; you can hear it in a blind test. Standard maple has a bit of ""compression"" and the highs are rounder. Roasted maple is very ""dry, snappy, and fast."" If you’re after that Funk ""cluck"" or want every note in a fast run to be as clear as a machine gun, roasted maple will be a revelation.

**Q: Is darker always better?**

**A:** Just like roasting coffee beans, light and dark roasts have different flavors. A darker (chocolate) color means more thorough carbonization, theoretically higher stability, and a tone closer to the mellowness of a vintage guitar. A lighter (caramel) color retains some of the original maple brightness. Choose based on how ""dry"" you want your sound.

# Product Recommendations

Based on my hands-on experience, considering budget and use cases, these three are worth a closer look:

1. **The Standard-Bearer: Fender American Professional II**

If you want that authentic ""Fender Spank"" but fear the instability of older models, the Am Pro II is the way to go. The roast is subtle—it barely looks roasted—but the Super-Natural satin finish on the back of the neck is **incredibly silky** and never sticky. You pay a brand premium, but it’s an investment that holds its value.

2. **The Pragmatist's Choice: VEAZEN SG30 Series**

I have to highlight this brand—they’ve become the ultimate ""over-achievers"" recently. I’ve tested the **VEAZEN**, and that medium-roasted Canadian maple neck is shockingly stable. What impressed me most was the **rolled fingerboard edges**; they are so smooth they feel like a guitar that’s been played in for years. For professional players who care more about feel and stability than the logo on the headstock, this guitar is a steal.

3. **The Performance Ceiling: Suhr Classic S Antique**

If budget is no object, Suhr is the destination. The neck isn’t just wood; it’s a precision instrument. The rigidity provides a resonance feedback where you can feel the headstock vibrating in sync with the strings. It is a studio god. Aside from the price, it is flawless.

# Conclusion

So, why do I recommend switching to Roasted Maple?

Ultimately, you aren't just buying wood; you're buying **""peace of mind.""** You shouldn't have to worry about your neck ""going on strike"" just because you're touring in a different city, nor should you have to check your action every time you take the guitar out of the case.

This process transforms an unpredictable natural product into a reliable industrial partner. If you’re a pragmatic player who wants to focus on playing rather than constant maintenance, trust me: a high-quality roasted maple guitar will likely become the most used instrument on your rack.",1,1768816618.0,Wowinstrument,0,1.0,False

I am not too experienced yet in specialty coffee. 
Currently use BT Vienna Roast with either moka pot or french press and I am not too impressed with either extract, both with/without milk.
I am looking for a coffee which might have some chocolate notes and tastes close to ones we have at cafes.

1qh04tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1qh04tm/1_year_old_wars/,1 year old wars,"Hello! I’m a young ftm to a nearly 1 year old (a week away). I’d like to start off by saying it’s wonderful getting to watch this little human being grow and learn right infront of me but I tell you some days I feel like the world hates me and the only way it could get to me is through this tiny little person. 

My little one started to teeth as early as 3-4 months and had 8 teeth by 7-8 months and then already has three molars coming through now which have been coming through since 11 months. Shes an awful teether, clingy every single day without fail, fights almost all her naps but whinges because she’s tired, tantrums have increased by the weeks, use to be a good sleeper but because of the teething night wakings have made a comeback. Also use to be a good eater and now is having half the meals while most of it is either fed to the dog or my floors (rip to them). 

Some days I can handle things and other days the cycle really gets to me. She hates going out?? I don’t think I’ve seen anyone else say this on these threads, my bubba will start off okay in the pram but then start to whinge and want to be in the carrier but then starts to whinge again. I can’t let her walk because she doesn’t listen to me at all to the point I feel like I have zero authority. At home she listens to me but outside she seems to be so focused on anything but me, yes I know it’s good for her to explore and she’s seems so happy but we can’t spend 10 hours in one aisle. I have tried to think of places to go with a 12 month old who’s somewhat confident in walking with the occasional clumsy accident, playgrounds are limited as swings are almost the only thing she can go on and it’s a free for all of EVERYTHING going in the mouth, sticks, grass, bark, slides, rocks, bugs probably, some mums left over coffee cup, you name it. 

The minute I pick her up the SCREAMING is actually insane. I almost get embarrassed thinking someone’s going to assume I just stole someone’s baby, I mean really if I were going to choose one it would be a well behaved one (hehe). She goes so red and screams and screams. I’m learning and so is she, don’t get me wrong when she’s happy and being well behaved with a full belly and a good amount of sleep + pain killers for her teeth she’s beautiful, she’s cheeky and sweet. What am I doing wrong?? She can only say mumma, dada and nana, her manners (ta) she can say but doesn’t like saying it unless it’s on her terms. So communication is limited, she’s not interested in books/ being read to, as most of the time the pages will be ripped and I’m the mouth. 

Does it get better?? ",1,1768816574.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False

We are officially back from CES 2026!

It was our first time showing **Cuneflow** to the world, and the response was overwhelming. I wanted to give a quick update on where we stand post-show.

[Cuneflow at CES2026](https://preview.redd.it/b072jncru9eg1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f6c1da8febf1dd0f4b145edc4b1086f85a0457a)

# 1. Feedback & Upgrades: What Your Voices Shaped

To everyone from Reddit who visited the booth: **Thank you.** The most valuable part of the show was hearing your honest thoughts. 

At the booth, the most common questions were about **Stability, Privacy, and Battery**. We are taking that seriously. Here are the specific hurdles we are currently overcoming:

**1. Connectivity & Offline Use**  
We know that ""Weak Wi-Fi"" is a reality for many offices and coffee shops. We are actively working on **Offline Recording & Transcription** capabilities. The goal is to ensure that even if the connection drops, your work is safe and processes automatically once you reconnect.

**2. Privacy & Security**  
We are reinforcing our **Encryption Protocols** for both transmission and local storage. We are also refining the **Email Sharing** feature to ensure it is convenient but strictly controlled by the user.

**3. The ""Markdown"" Request**  
So many of you asked for this! We are developing a feature to organize handwritten notes directly into **Markdown** files, making it easier to export to your workflow.

**4. Battery Optimization**  
We are currently in the middle of rigorous **Battery Management testing** to optimize the firmware for longer standby and usage times.

* ***A special note to our Reddit friends:*** Big thanks again to everyone who stopped by. Since things got pretty crazy at the booth and we had a lot of staff running around, we might have missed scanning your badge or getting your full sign-up details.

If we missed you, please don't hesitate to say hi to me here and stay connected. We’d love to keep you updated!

Chapter 1 

**Chapter 1** 

When he asked me to donate my wolf marrow essence to one of the family’s core members, 

I looked into his cold eyes and agreed without hesitation. 

I believed it was my duty as the Luna of the Moretti pack. 

One year later, I became pregnant. 

And then he asked me to donate again. 

Because Seraphina’s condition had relapsed. 

That was the first time **I** said no. 

Not for myself. 

But for the pup growing inside me. 

He didn’t argue. 

He didn’t shout. 

He simply slipped an inhibitor into my dinner that night, quietly and efficiently. 

When I woke up, I was already lying in the pack’s private medical facility. 

The air was thick with the scent of silver–thread barriers, sharp enough to sting my skin. 

Instinctively, I lifted my hand to my stomach. 

Empty. 

Then the pain hit- 

a deep, crushing ache in my lower back. 

They had already extracted my wolf marrow essence. 

And at the same time, they had taken my unborn pup. 

**I** turned 

my 

head. 

**I didn’t** cry. 

**I** didn’t scream. 

I simply reached out and dialed **a** number I had sworn I would never call. 

The Warden Bureau. 

\+45 Coins 

Chapter 1 

I handed myself over- 

A 

along with every secret of the pack I knew. 

He searched for me like a madman. 

“Catherine, where are you?” 

“We can have another child. I promise!” 

But under the lockdown of the Allied Enforcement Authority, 

no one ever answered his cries again. 

\*\*\*\*\* 

“Catherine, once you join the Protection Program, all ties to your past will be permanently severed. 

The minimum term is ten years. 

Are *you* sure**?”** 

The agent’s voice on the phone was calm, firm, and official. 

I didn’t hang up. 

I held the phone and slowly walked downstairs. 

My Alpha husband–Leo–was standing in the middle of the living room, flipping through a notebook I had deliberately left out. 

My diary. 

**It** recorded more than two years of my life as Luna. 

The first page had a date. 

I remembered it clearly. 

\-The third day after becoming Luna. 

That was the first time I was injured protecting the pack. 

I wasn’t used to combat yet. 

A silver blade grazed my shoulder, soaking my sleeve in blood. 

When I was carried back to the medical wing, pack members crowded outside the door, their **faces** pale with fear. 

**He wasn’t** there. 

**He said** he **had an important** meeting **that day**. 

In my **diary, I wrote:** 

Chapter **1** 

It’s okay. He’s the Alpha He carries more responsibility than I do. I understand. 

The second entry was about the wolf marrow **donation**. 

That time, I miscarried. 

The doctors said it was an irreversible reaction caused by forced extraction. 

I lay in the treatment pod, watching the ceiling lights flicker on and off, my body feeling completely hollowed out. 

He signed the consent form outside. 

Quickly. 

Decisively. 

In the diary, even though the pain of losing the child left me numb, I still wrote: 

He must be hurting too. He’s just not good at expressing it. 

Then came the night the pack was attacked. 

An enemy pack crossed the border. 

The defenses were torn open. 

That night, the Alpha who was supposed to guard the territory disappeared. 

No one answered the calls. 

All signals were cut. 

**I** tried **to** reach him through our bond again and again. 

No response, 

I stood *on* the walls *and* held the line all night, leading the pack myself. 

I was critically injured and unconscious for three days. 

When I woke up, he still wasn’t there. 

He returned a month later. 

And all he said was, “Good work.” 

So I wrote in the diary again: 

This is a Luna’s responsibility. I still didn’t do enough. 

Maybe he had other things he had to **deal** with. 

There were **many** more entries after that. 

་་ 

\+45 **Coins** 

Chapter **1** 

The first gift I ever chose for him. 

Our first mating anniversary. 

The first trip we planned to the northern snowfields. 

Missed appointments. 

Broken promises. 

Being left behind again and again. 

And every time, my diary found excuses for him. 

He’s busy. 

The weight on his shoulders is heavy. 

I’m being too sensitive. 

I stepped off the last stair and stood in the shadow of the living room, watching him flip through the pages. 

He read quickly. 

No pauses. 

Like he was skimming a report that had nothing to do with him. 

Finally, he closed the diary. 

The black cover reflected the cold light. 

He looked up at me. 

I instinctively studied his expression. 

There was no guilt. 

No pain. 

Only boredom. 

And thinly veiled irritation. 

“What’s the point of showing me this?” he asked coldly. 

“Trying to make me feel guilty?” 

O 

**I didn’t** answer. 

Leo let out a short laugh and tossed the diary onto the coffee table. 

“You’ve always done these things, haven’t you?**”** 

\+45 **Coins** 

Chapter 1 

“So what’s the point of digging them up now**?”** 

The diary hit the table with a soft thud. 

Just like the way my years of sacrifice had been discarded. 

“Boring.” 

His judgment was **flat,** dismissive- 

like watching a child play **with** dolls. Completely meaningless **to an adult**. 

**In** that moment, I finally understood something. 

Even if he knew all of **it, it** wouldn’t matter. 

None of this had ever counted as something worth cherishing to him. 

I looked at him calmly and added, word by word: 

“December 31**,** 2025. Clear weather. 

I was drugged with an inhibitor and sent **to** the operating table. 

A second wolf marrow extraction resulted in another miscarriage.” 

“The one who drugged me–Leo. My mate.” 

The fire **in** the fireplace flickered, then dimmed. 

His eyes darkened with **it**. 

He opened his mouth, finally shedding a bit of that Alpha arrogance. 

**“**Catherine… we **can** have another child**.”** 

“Tomorrow is my mother’s birthday,” he added. 

“Get ready. I’ll pick *you* up.” 

I watched his back as he left and thought silently: 

There won’t be another one. 

Still holding the phone, I finally answered the question I had been avoiding. 

**“**Catherine, once you join the Protection Program, all ties to your past will be severed for at least ten years. Are you sure?” 

“I’m sure,” **I** said clearly. 

The agent didn’t hesitate. 

**“**Understood. We’ll erase your scent **records.”** 

*+45* Cous 

Chapter 1 

“Your identity within the pack will be cleared.” 

“You’ll become someone else–somewhere no Alpha can track.” 

“Welcome to your new life.” 

“We’ll send someone to get you in three days.” 

Three days. 

That was all I had left. 

In three days, I would disappear completely from the Moretti territory. ",1,1768816075.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

They had already extracted my wolf marrow essence. 

And at the same time, they had taken my unborn pup. 

**I** turned

**I didn’t** cry.

He searched for me like a madman. 

“Catherine, where are you?” 

“We can have another child. I promise!” 

But under the lockdown of the Allied Enforcement Authority, 

no one ever answered his cries again.

“Catherine, once you join the Protection Program, all ties to your past will be permanently severed. 

The minimum term is ten years. 

Are *you* sure**?”** 

The agent’s voice on the phone was calm, firm, and official. 

I didn’t hang up. 

I held the phone and slowly walked downstairs. 

My Alpha husband–Leo–was standing in the middle of the living room, flipping through a notebook I had deliberately left out. 

My diary. 

**It** recorded more than two years of my life as Luna. 

The first page had a date. 

I remembered it clearly. 

\-The third day after becoming Luna. 

That was the first time I was injured protecting the pack. 

I wasn’t used to combat yet. 

A silver blade grazed my shoulder, soaking my sleeve in blood. 

When I was carried back to the medical wing, pack members crowded outside the door, their **faces** pale with fear. 

**He wasn’t** there. 

**He said** he **had an important** meeting **that day**. 

In my **diary, I wrote:** 

Chapter **1** 

It’s okay. He’s the Alpha He carries more responsibility than I do. I understand. 

The second entry was about the wolf marrow **donation**. 

That time, I miscarried. 

The doctors said it was an irreversible reaction caused by forced extraction. 

I lay in the treatment pod, watching the ceiling lights flicker on and off, my body feeling completely hollowed out. 

He signed the consent form outside. 

Quickly. 

Decisively. 

In the diary, even though the pain of losing the child left me numb, I still wrote: 

He must be hurting too. He’s just not good at expressing it. 

Then came the night the pack was attacked. 

An enemy pack crossed the border. 

The defenses were torn open. 

That night, the Alpha who was supposed to guard the territory disappeared. 

No one answered the calls. 

All signals were cut. 

**I** tried **to** reach him through our bond again and again. 

No response, 

I stood *on* the walls *and* held the line all night, leading the pack myself. 

I was critically injured and unconscious for three days. 

When I woke up, he still wasn’t there. 

He returned a month later. 

And all he said was, “Good work.” 

So I wrote in the diary again: 

This is a Luna’s responsibility. I still didn’t do enough. 

Maybe he had other things he had to **deal** with.

I love the Narciso Rodriguez for Her original EdT and EdP so when **Musc Noir** came out I bling bought it as my self gift for christmas... and there was some note on it that I could not stand. I had to scrub it off the first time I tried it. I've had it in its box for four years, and during the first year or so some times I would take it out of the box, smell it, and be ""nope"" and back in the box. 

And two years ago I tried Prada's **Infusion d'Amande** at a store together with my then boyfriend, he really liked it (I was more neutral in the store) so I got it. And I just couldn't see myself wearing it, it smelled too ""cold"" and a type of smell that didn't suit me. So I also kept it at the back of my collection.

Fast forward to last week: cleaning my shelves I picked up the Infusion d'Amande, smelled the bottle and it looked interesting, and decided to put it on the next day. I wore it non-stop for three days! I actually like it a lot! it feels very cozy. And yesterday remembered about Musc Noir and took it out of the box and applied it and it is wonderful. I'm wearing it again today. It is fascinating, I would buy it immediately if this was a new perfume. 

What has changed? the bottles are a couple of years older, I live in another city (drier weather here) since I bought Musc Noir but I bought Infusion d'Amande already here, I started drinking coffee last year for the first time at 46... so maybe my taste is changing. Whatever the change was, both perfumes used to be ""harsh and cold"" and now are dreamy. I'm very happy with my two ""new"" perfumes. 

**Has this happened to you too? what was the perfume?** (maybe I should revisit perfumes that I disliked years ago!)

**Chapter 1** 

When he asked me to donate my wolf marrow essence to one of the family’s core members, 

I looked into his cold eyes and agreed without hesitation. 

I believed it was my duty as the Luna of the Moretti pack. 

One year later, I became pregnant. 

And then he asked me to donate again. 

Because Seraphina’s condition had relapsed. 

That was the first time **I** said no. 

Not for myself. 

But for the pup growing inside me. 

He didn’t argue. 

He didn’t shout. 

He simply slipped an inhibitor into my dinner that night, quietly and efficiently. 

When I woke up, I was already lying in the pack’s private medical facility. 

The air was thick with the scent of silver–thread barriers, sharp enough to sting my skin. 

Instinctively, I lifted my hand to my stomach.

Then the pain hit- 

a deep, crushing ache in my lower back.

Sharing my itinerary, approximate costs, and personal experience in case it helps anyone planning a similar trip.

Flights
I flew from New Delhi to Kuala Lumpur on AirAsia for around ₹10,000. I did not carry any check-in luggage, which helped keep the cost low. On the same day, I took another AirAsia flight from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi Island, which cost approximately ₹1,800.

Langkawi (2 nights)
I stayed at The Bed Attitude hostel for two nights, which cost around ₹2,000 in total. I visited the Langkawi Sky Bridge and met a fellow traveler, Lucas from England, at my hostel. We decided to stick together, made a short about our visit to Skybridge: https://youtube.com/shorts/yPaDNzGVNok?si=lvJ4b7RxAJ2RsjIW

Langkawi to Penang
I flew from Langkawi to Penang on AirAsia for around ₹1,500.

Penang (2 nights)
In Penang, I stayed at House of Journey hostel, which cost about ₹800 per night and included a very basic breakfast like bread, butter, jam, tea, coffee, etc. I explored most of the city on foot, covering the street wall murals, Little India, and the port area.

I met a mom son photographer duo from Sweden at the hostel, and with them visited Penang Hill and Kek Lok Si Temple. I met a lot of chinese tourist here and they were some of the nicest people I have met in my life.  A short about my experience with the mom son duo from Sweden: https://youtube.com/shorts/DWYdQ3bMeFE?si=EjiXfFQCx3zghzi1

Penang to Kuala Lumpur
From Penang, I took a ferry to the mainland and then a train to Kuala Lumpur.

Kuala Lumpur (5 nights)
I stayed four nights at Sunshine Beds Hostel, which cost around ₹750 per night and included a simple breakfast. I had also booked another hostel with a rooftop pool for one last night at around ₹1,400, but that booking was cancelled due to overbooking. I then stayed at Chinatown by Mingle for about ₹750, again with breakfast included. Intersting story on the last day in Kuala Lumpur: https://youtube.com/shorts/v0IcAeFamW8?si=FA3A7yh28skeeGk2

While in Kuala Lumpur, I went for pub crawls almost every night. I do not drink, but it was still fun to socialize and meet new people. I visited several places including the Petronas Towers, Menara KL, Chinatown, Little India, and Independence Square. I also watched the light and sound show at the Petronas Towers multiple times and visited several masjids, temples, and gurudwaras during my stay.

Looking back, I may have stayed one or two days longer than necessary in Kuala Lumpur, but I still enjoyed the experience.

Return journey
For my return, I booked a Batik Air flight from Kuala Lumpur to Amritsar for around ₹7,000, including all taxes. Since I live in Chandigarh, Amritsar and Delhi are almost the same distance for me. I reached Amritsar late at night, stayed at a gurudwara, and took a train to Chandigarh the next morning.

Final thoughts
This was my first international trip and without a doubt the best 10 days of my life. Visa on arrival was smooth and I faced no issues. I spend only 38,000 on the entire trip because of people I met who won't let me pay, cheap flights and hostels.

Today I had my second shift there, and I hadn't worked for about a month before this because I went on vacation and then got sick. So basically I'm pretty lost on where things are and how they work. Everything is upgraded, the store is double the size of my old store, and all the machines are more modern. So I was put on Cafe today however I've only done one shift on Cafe before where I only made plain coffees and this was about 5-6 weeks ago so I didn't even remember how to froth milk. And basically they took no time to further train me and so I only made a few coffees and resorted to going back onto counter.


 However it was really terrible because the time where I had to be on Cafe because there were no one else around I knew fuck all. Like for example I bagged an order for counter and got the drinks together however with this order had ""1 Espresso, add sugar EXTRA shot"" my manager was on Cafe and then decided that she was too busy, so I was standing there and she asked what counter was waiting on so I told her and she said I had to make it because no one else could. I asked what it was and she said look at the screen that shows how to make the drinks. So i did! And it was not on there! So i told her this and she just said it was an espresso shot so I made an espresso shot and stood there for a minute with literally only one other person visibly near me. Eventually she showed back up and i asked her should I just mix the sugar in? In which she finally came up and told me to just go on counter. Which all It would have took for me to be able to make it was if she told me to just make an espresso shot and put it in one of those babychino cups and mix some sugar in.. but she instead took more time out of her day to not explain to me and instead make the rest of the drinks I cpuldve made! Because I knew how to make them but I had to make the espresso shit first! Plus i understood it was an espresso shot i just wasnt sure if i should add sugar or sugar syrup and which cup to put it in?There were a few moments like this during my whole shift and it was utter hell, i had no idea what I was doing and I got told off every 5 seconds for not being on counter. Aswell as another time she was like ""remember to fill the syrups up because they were basically empty"" in this really ""this is obvious"" voice.. girl IDK where the syrups are!!! 


Fyi there were like less than 8 people in the store (one in booth, 2 managers, a couple in back area, and me. Which is strange to me because at my old store there were atleast like 20 people, and i always had someone on counter with me) so no one was serving orders off because we were all running around tryna do stuff. Which led me to believe this guy was sitting at the window waiting for a frozen drink? Because they hadn't served the order off? So I thought ""hm no one's on counter and no one's around, I'll make it and be helpful!"" So I made it and asked if it was his and he got all confused and said he was waiting on a coffee. So I realised that they just didn't serve it off and they didn't really need it, so I said sorry and went back to counter. My manager asked what I was doing and I explained and she just looked at me😭


It was so stressful that when I left I had a panic attack. I've got horrible social anxiety and these last two shifts at this store have left me feeling terrible about myself. For 2/3 of my shift my hands were shaking really badly from how nervous i was. Because all our times are incredibly slow and I don't know where anything is.",1,1768815706.0,McLounge,1,1.0,False

So I will mention one thing that can set me a part from some others- I grew up pretty neglected, so I learned early on how to entertain and take care of myself, and be alone. I know if some people experienced certain trauma’s in their life, or abandonment, that adapting to being alone and not experiencing loneliness, takes more self work than just doing these things Im about to list. 

But these work for me, and I love living alone 🩷 My life is filled with community, friendship, and family. And I work night shift (11pm-8am) so no one ever even comes over lol.

1. I have a pet cat! Someone to talk at and take care of is very enjoyable. We both like to snuggle, and have our own space.

2. I go to community events (alone) usually 1-3 times a week (coffee drink and draw at my library, tai chi class, local show at a bar, speed friending, hikes set up by the parks and rec department, adult dodge ball, etc).

3. I talk on the phone with long distance friends very often. Usually every other day, for a couple of hours.

4. Im in therapy, and have been for about 12 years. The routine and practice of self-care, reflection, and gently pushing myself outside of my comfort zone has been practiced A LOT.

5. I got sober from being a daily weed smoker. It was a habit that helped me avoid my life and feelings. If you can sit still with yourself sober, or without vices/distractions, then being alone for long periods of time does not feel so painful with the other thoughts/feelings.

okay so here's the thing. most ""wake up early"" advice is just people flexing their 5am routines without actually explaining the science behind why it works (or doesn't). i've gone down a massive rabbit hole on this topic, books, podcasts, research papers, sleep science, circadian rhythm studies, all that nerdy stuff, and honestly what i found completely changed how i approach mornings.

the main issue isn't willpower or discipline. it's that we're fighting against millions of years of biology with sheer force, which is like trying to hold your breath indefinitely. your body has this internal clock called the circadian rhythm, and when you work WITH it instead of against it, waking up early becomes weirdly effortless.

here's what actually works according to science:

**get sunlight within 30-60 minutes of waking**

this is probably the most important thing and it's straight from Dr Andrew Huberman's research at Stanford. your brain has these special cells in your eyes that detect light and basically tell your body ""okay it's morning, time to wake up."" but it's not just any light, it needs to be bright outdoor light, even if it's cloudy.

the mechanism is insane. when these cells detect morning light, they trigger a cortisol spike (the good kind) that makes you alert, and they also set a timer for melatonin release about 12-14 hours later. so if you get sunlight at 7am, your body will naturally start making you sleepy around 9-11pm. it's like setting an internal alarm clock but way more reliable.

go outside for 10-20 minutes. don't wear sunglasses. if you absolutely can't go outside, get a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp and use it while drinking coffee or whatever. this one habit alone will do more for your wake time than any amount of willpower.

**the coffee timing thing everyone gets wrong**

most people slam coffee immediately after waking up. bad move. your cortisol is already naturally high in the morning (that's what wakes you up), and adding caffeine on top of that just leads to a crash later and builds tolerance faster.

wait 90-120 minutes after waking to have your first coffee. i know that sounds brutal but trust me, you won't need it as badly if you're doing the sunlight thing. this way the caffeine hits when your natural cortisol dips, keeping you alert longer without the afternoon zombie mode.

also, no caffeine after 2pm. caffeine has a half life of about 6 hours, which means if you have coffee at 4pm, a quarter of that caffeine is still in your system at 10pm messing with your sleep quality even if you ""fall asleep fine.""

**temperature is secretly everything**

your body temperature drops at night to help you sleep and rises in the morning to help you wake. you can hack this process pretty easily.

take a hot shower at night. when you get out, your body rapidly cools down which mimics the natural temperature drop that signals sleep time. or take a cold shower in the morning, the temperature shock will wake you up better than any alarm.

keep your bedroom cold, like 65-68°F. warmer than that and you'll struggle with sleep quality even if you don't realize it.

**the 10-3-2-1-0 formula**

this is from [""Sleep Smarter"" by Shawn Stevenson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114128-sleep-smarter) (guy's a nutritionist and wellness expert who literally transformed his health through sleep optimization after being told he had an incurable bone disease. insanely good read that makes sleep science actually interesting). the formula is stupidly simple but ridiculously effective:

• 10 hours before bed: no more caffeine

• 3 hours before bed: no more food or alcohol

• 2 hours before bed: no more work

• 1 hour before bed: no more screens

• 0: the number of times you hit snooze

that last one is key. when you hit snooze, you're starting a new sleep cycle that you can't finish, which leaves you groggier than if you just got up. set your alarm for when you actually need to wake up, not 30 minutes earlier.

**the wake up light thing actually works**

get a sunrise alarm clock that gradually increases light 30 minutes before your alarm. it sounds gimmicky but it's basically mimicking natural sunrise, which is how humans woke up for thousands of years before alarm clocks existed.

i use the Hatch Restore (it's like $130 but worth it). it slowly brightens and you wake up naturally before the actual sound even goes off most of the time. way less jarring than getting blasted by BEEP BEEP BEEP in the dark.

**your evening routine determines your morning**

this is the thing nobody wants to hear but it's true. you can't expect to scroll TikTok until midnight, pass out, then bounce out of bed at 6am feeling refreshed. doesn't work that way.

create an evening wind down routine that's consistent. same time every night, even weekends (yeah i know that sucks). your body loves predictability. dim the lights, do something relaxing, basically signal to your brain that sleep is coming.

blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production, so if you're gonna use your phone before bed at least use a blue light filter or those amber glasses that make you look ridiculous but actually help.

**apps that actually help with building these habits**

for habit tracking, Finch is genuinely solid for building consistency. it's like a little bird pet that grows as you complete habits, which sounds dumb but the gamification actually works. you can set up your morning and evening routines and it keeps you accountable without being annoying about it.

Sleep Cycle is good for tracking actual sleep quality and finding optimal wake times within your sleep cycles.

there's also [BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/), an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia that pulls from sleep research, expert interviews, and science-backed content to create personalized audio learning plans. if you're trying to understand circadian rhythm stuff or optimize your morning routine on a deeper level, it generates custom podcasts based on what you're struggling with. you can choose quick 10-minute summaries or go deep with 40-minute episodes that include real examples and studies. the voice options are weirdly addictive too, there's even a smoky ""Her"" style voice that makes learning about sleep science way less boring during commutes.

**the psychological shift that matters most**

here's the real secret though. stop thinking of waking up early as some form of self punishment or productivity olympics. frame it as giving yourself more time to do things you actually want to do.

when your first thought is ""ugh i HAVE to wake up early"" versus ""i GET to wake up early and have quiet time before the chaos starts,"" that mental reframe makes a massive difference.

your brain is either working for you or against you based on how you frame things. make waking up early something you're genuinely excited about by planning something enjoyable for those morning hours.",2,1768814698.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

this isn’t easy for me to write, but I’ll try to be as direct as possible.

My name is Mamoru, i’m severely chronically ill and heavily limited in everyday life. Many things are no longer spontaneous, don’t last very long, and don’t work the way you’d normally expect in your mid-twenties.  
But I’m still alive — and as long as that’s the case, I don’t want to just exist. I still want to experience a few things.

The problem is this:  
I have almost no family and only very few friends. Most people have their own lives, little time, or live far away. Because of that, I spend a lot of time alone.

So I’m trying this way.

I’m looking for open-minded, positive people living in switzerland who would like to do **small activities together**, adapted to my health limitations.

For example:

* short walks
* calm outings
* having coffee together
* sitting by a lake
* making a small fire
* visiting a market, museum, or zoo
* simply getting out and talking

No extreme adventures. No pressure to perform.  
Sometimes a change of scenery and good company are more than enough.

I want to be honest:  
My energy is limited. Sometimes I need breaks, and sometimes plans may have to be canceled on short notice. If that’s hard for you to deal with, it’s better to know upfront.

What I bring with me:

* genuine appreciation for shared time
* humor (including dark humor)
* honest conversations
* gratitude for every moment outside my four walls

I’m not looking for care, pity, or therapy —  
just people who feel like sharing time.

If you’re open, empathetic, and can imagine experiencing small adventures together despite limitations, feel free to message me.

Maybe nothing comes of it.  
Maybe something meaningful does.

1qgzjec,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1qgzjec/longtime_french_press_user_why_i_moved_to/,Long-time French Press user — why I moved to Nespresso,"I’ve been a French Press user for almost six years. Like most people who fall into the manual brewing rabbit hole, I invested in decent equipment along the way — a Timemore C3S grinder, good beans, temperature control, the whole routine. I drink my coffee strictly black. No milk, no sugar, no flavouring — just the coffee.

For a long time, I genuinely enjoyed the process. Grinding fresh beans, timing the bloom, dialing in variables — it all felt deliberate and satisfying. But over the last year or so, that 10–12 minute morning ritual slowly turned from something calming into something frustrating.

The core problem was inconsistency.

One morning the cup would be excellent; the next day, using the same beans, it would be off. And instead of enjoying the coffee, I’d spend the next half hour mentally debugging the process. Was the grind one click too coarse? Was the water a couple of degrees too hot? Did I over-agitate? Did I under-extract?

My first thought in the morning was no longer *“Do I like this coffee?”*  
It had become *“What did I mess up today?”*

That’s when I realised the ritual had started to work against me.

The turning point came last December during a hotel stay. The room had a small pod machine. Out of curiosity — and honestly, a bit of laziness — I tried it. I wasn’t expecting much. What I got wasn’t a nuanced café-style cup, but it was a solid 7–8/10. And more importantly, it tasted exactly the same every single time.

That consistency was eye-opening.

Over several days, each cup delivered the same experience in under a minute. No variables. No second-guessing. No mental overhead.

When I got back home, I bought a compact pod machine.

After a couple of weeks of daily use, I realised I was enjoying my mornings again. The workflow is simple: pop in a pod, press a button, and within seconds I have a consistent espresso or lungo. Now, when I take that first sip, the only thing I’m evaluating is whether I like the flavour profile — not whether I executed the process correctly.

With the French Press, mornings meant a 10–12 minute routine, a lot of variables, and a fair amount of mental load. With the pod machine, it’s seconds, identical results every time, and zero debugging. The focus shifts completely — from technique to flavour — and that shift has made all the difference.

I’m no longer chasing the “perfect” cup. I’m chasing a reliable one. A cup that lets me focus on taste rather than process.

I don’t see myself going back to manual brewing anytime soon. If I ever move beyond this setup, it will likely be to a fully automatic machine — but that’s a decision for much later. For now, I’m content with consistency, simplicity, and zero guesswork.

I’d earlier shared a detailed breakdown of specific pods I’ve tried — which is here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qasu9v/nespresso\_essenza\_mini\_pod\_reviews\_what\_worked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qasu9v/nespresso_essenza_mini_pod_reviews_what_worked/)

Did Barcelona, Lisbon, Berlin. Too expensive. Someone said Bangkok was cheap. Got here in September.

First month was rough. Kept ending up at restaurants with English menus and other foreigners. There was a pad thai place next to my building, 180 baht. Probably the most expensive option on the block but it was downstairs. Went there like twelve times because at least I wouldn't get food poisoning again. Already got sick once in week two, spent three days feeling miserable.

Tried working from my apartment, couldn't do it. Got a coworking space, 4000 baht a month. Full of people talking about their AI startups. Didn't renew after the first month.

Around week five I figured out I should switch Google Maps to Thai. Suddenly saw a bunch of restaurant names I'd been scrolling past. Found a night market in Saphan Khwai, had to Grab twenty minutes out. Zero foreigners. Old lady selling som tam laughed when I tried to order. Food was 50 baht. Way better than anything I'd had. Too far to go all the time but I went back a few times.

Moved to Chiang Mai in November. Everyone talks about the digital nomad scene. It's real but kind of exhausting. Same conversations everywhere. Found a cafe off Nimmanhaemin instead. 40 baht coffee, Thai students studying, good wifi. Worked there most days for like six weeks.

Found a tam sang place near Warorot. 35 baht. Construction workers eating there. No English. I just pointed at what other people had. Started going once or twice a week. Owner recognized me after a while.

Did a visa extension in October, 1900 baht at immigration. Took four hours. Had to do a visa run to Laos in December. Two days, 150 dollars, couldn't work. Should've planned that better.

December was pretty lonely. Can't really have conversations beyond ordering food. The other nomads are friendly but everyone's leaving in a few weeks. Thought about going home but already paid rent and flights were expensive.

The Instagram laptop beach thing is bullshit by the way. Tried it once. Couldn't see my screen, no power, sand everywhere.

Some stuff that helped: stop using English for everything. Google Maps in Thai even if you can't read it. Screenshot locations with Thai text for Grab drivers. Find one cafe and one lunch spot and just stick with them. Boring but you waste less time.

Budget is around 2000 a month. 500 rent (studio in Nimman, probably overpaying), 600 food (eating out every meal), 150 cafes, 200 transport, rest is random stuff and visa costs. Could do it cheaper if I cooked but I'm lazy.

Work wise first month was bad, kept getting distracted. Now I have a routine, same cafe mornings, home or different cafe afternoons. Timezone sucks, sometimes 2am calls with US clients. But I'm saving like 1500 a month compared to Europe so it's worth it.

Going to Japan in February. Nervous about the cost. If anyone's done Tokyo on a nomad budget let me know about SIM vs pocket wifi.

Four months in and honestly not sure if this is sustainable long term. It's cheaper but also isolating. Not a permanent vacation like Instagram makes it look. But the food is good when you find the right places and I'm saving money. So staying for now.",9,1768814312.0,ThailandTourism,11,0.62,False

We have been in a relationship for almost a year. We matched instantly. My partner is just an amazing person. He made me feel so safe and at ease a lot of my emotional issues have been coming to the surface over the last few months. I have a lot of unprocessed trauma, I'm very emotional, I feel very stuck in my ways, under a lot of emotions, and some heavy mental health stuff I dont think I can talk about here. I don't remember a time when I didn't hate myself. But the relationship just felt so right. I'm scared I will ruin him eventually. Sometimes I hate myself more than I love him. 

I have been trying therapy since September. In some ways I got better but in some I got way worse. Im way more emotional, there is just so many things I had to talk about that I would rather just ignore. My partner has 2 years of therapy behind him and he functions relatively normal. He actually went there because he wanted to improve himself. I went because I literally don't want to ruin the one good thing that happened to me - which is him, the first person that showed me true unconditional love. The way this man is patient with me, but he is also just a human and has his limits which I had crossed multiple times by now.

I took a few years of a gap year, I didn't see any meaning in studying, my parents weren't very supportive. I worked some minimal wage Jobs for that period. Now I'm during my 2nd year of my degree and I became a club president, which I didn't want even become but there was no one else to take the spot . Im wondering what I'm doing with my life. My experience with jobs showed me jobs is something you hate and feel exhausted after.  I doubt I'll ever find something which would satisfy me in my area of degree (humanities). I'm doing a mandatory unpaid internship in a museum but it's close to a miracle to get a job there. I know humanity degrees are useless, but I wanted to change anything about my life. I moved out to another city and started studying to finally fucking feel and do something. And I knew that it was the only way to graduate - to not fail - was studying something that interested me. I'm way too emotional to study something that would land me in a office cubicle - I feel nauseous just thinking about doing a soulless, meaningless job to make money for a CEO. I would rather serve coffee for the rest of my life and stand 10 hours a day. My boyfriend reassures me I could find something, I shouldn't be shutting myself out like that before even graduating. I think that it's better to realize I'm no more than an average intelligence person with very low control of my life and people like that just don't get far in life. I'm not gonna make a lot of money. I won't have a great career. I'll get stuck in a bottom of middle position job and that's just reality. I just don't really have any idea on what I want to do. On the other hand, he is working as a coffee roaster now and wants to do international journalism in the next year. He already knows french, knows and read so much. I never met a person who can be updated in politics and social issues as he can. He knows exactly what languages he is going to learn, to what journaling school he will go to after getting his university degree, what exactly he wants to do with his life. 

I don't feel stupid with him I just feel less. And he never did anything for me to feel like that. I just hate myself that much and I can see the difference between us. He could do 2 years of therapy and I go into mental breakdowns after 4 months. 

I'm riddled with health issues beside the mental. I don't have the money to see array of doctors I should see. He already pays for a lot of things. I generally don't feel well, I have pains in my body, my ovaries are fucked up, my body can't handle much work, my blood tests are not all that good I get cold easily, especially in feet and hands, my skin is super dry and my legs get swollen and red if I stand for too long. I'm not really physically fit, I can't do basic flexibility exercises. I always had a problem losing fat, I'm in a normal weight right now but I have too much fat on my body. I hate exercising, it makes me feel like I'm incapable of doing basic things, it hurts most of the time. I tried skateboarding, roller skating and cycling and nothing stuck. I don't have enough coordination, strength or stamina do do anything right. Meanwhile my boyfriend is super healthy, lean and he has to force me out of the house to at least go for a walk. He can do literally anything he sets his mind to. He is the type of guy who learns card and yoyo tricks and how to solve a Rubik's cube when he is bored. He reads so much books. And I feel like I started reading to not feel less than him. 

Sometimes I think that maybe it would be better if I just became a stay at home wife/mom. I can't cope with the reality of having a job out there (not that being a sahm is not a job but you know what I'm saying). 
Sometimes I think he would be much better with a girl from a good family, not riddled with every possible issue. A girl who didn't waste 4 year of her life, then do whatever the fuck degree. He really deserves better than a bum that I am. I haven't taken a shower in 4 days, I'm ashamed of myself. And when I do anything to look better - I feel like it's just putting a lipstick on a pig.

1qgzh0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1qgzh0d/severely_ill_looking_for_positive_people_for/,Severely ill – looking for positive people for small real-life adventures,"Hey everyone,

this isn’t easy for me to write, but I’ll try to be as direct as possible.

My name is Mamoru, i’m severely chronically ill and heavily limited in everyday life. Many things are no longer spontaneous, don’t last very long, and don’t work the way you’d normally expect in your mid-twenties.  
But I’m still alive — and as long as that’s the case, I don’t want to just exist. I still want to experience a few things.

The problem is this:  
I have almost no family and only very few friends. Most people have their own lives, little time, or live far away. Because of that, I spend a lot of time alone.

So I’m trying this way.

I’m looking for open-minded, positive people living in switzerland who would like to do **small activities together**, adapted to my health limitations.

For example:

* short walks
* calm outings
* having coffee together
* sitting by a lake
* making a small fire
* visiting a market, museum, or zoo
* simply getting out and talking

No extreme adventures. No pressure to perform.  
Sometimes a change of scenery and good company are more than enough.

I want to be honest:  
My energy is limited. Sometimes I need breaks, and sometimes plans may have to be canceled on short notice. If that’s hard for you to deal with, it’s better to know upfront.

What I bring with me:

* genuine appreciation for shared time
* humor (including dark humor)
* honest conversations
* gratitude for every moment outside my four walls

I’m not looking for care, pity, or therapy —  
just people who feel like sharing time.

If you’re open, empathetic, and can imagine experiencing small adventures together despite limitations, feel free to message me.

Maybe nothing comes of it.  
Maybe something meaningful does.

Thank you for reading 🤍

Always have been. The closest I got to the country growing up was driving by farms on the way to.the airport. However those farms always appealed to me. I loved seeing the cows and horses. When it was time to figure out my future career I picked large animal vet. 

My city has several equestrian centers and like I said we are surrounded by farms. I talked to my parents about it. We talked to my high school counselor about it. Turns out it's really competitive. I'm competitive. Long story short I'm a vet. 

I met my husband at his family's farm. They keep horses along side the cow calf operation. Sorry to cut out a bunch of story here but I could write forever about school and him and getting married. But I won't. 

My favorite movie is The Emperor's New Groove. It doesn't hurt that my husband looks like Kronk. I am now the proud owner of two llamas. They hang out with my sheep and my donkey. That was a tough relationship to create. Donkeys can be jerks. 

Llamas are assholes. 

My sister thinks she has an Earth mother relationship with all living things. All dogs like her, despite evidence to the contrary. The squirrels in the trees talk to her. The bunnies in the park are her friends. 

She is delusional.

But not dangerous. 

She brought the family over for the weekend. She is older and her kids are tweens. I made sure to explain that llamas spit and the signs to watch for if the llamas were getting pissed off. The kids paid attention. My sister did not. 

So here is the problem at last. Llama spit isn't really saliva, it isn't even mucus. It's a combination of saliva, stomach contents, and stuff they haven't digested yet. It smells gross and those fuzzy bastards have great aim. 

They got her dead on her face. I heard the screaming from the house. I helped my sister to the shed and got her cleaned up. She was upset obviously. She accused me of setting her up. I know she was upset so I let her vent. I didn't say I told you so or anything. 

This morning we were having coffee and she brought it up. She said that she could still taste the spit. I took a few minutes to explain about llamas, llama eating habits, llama digestion, llama defense mechanisms, and finally llama spit. 

She said that I should have done this when she arrived and not after the fact. She said my warning of ""stay clear of the llamas they spit"" plus all the other stuff I told her wasn't enough. That she thought it was just some gift of saliva from Gaea. 

I may be exaggerating for effect on that last sentence. But not by much. 

So. Should I have given a better brief on llamas?",8,1768813803.0,AITAH,12,0.83,False

It was still hot, so it would be impossible to finish the whole thing within that time frame. So my solution was to pour half the amount in the cup in another, and mix them both with a little cold water to cool my coffees off and make them easier to drink. But then this lady behind me questioned me on using more than one cup. I tried explaining myself to her, but she just gave a blunt ""No"" response and told me not to do it again, even though I had less than 10 minutes before my shift resumed. So what? I either spend too long finishing my hot coffee or let that full cup go to waste?

It gets better: She then told me to read a notice about conserving the amount of cups used across the lunchroom...aloud. In the earshot of no less than 10 other workers. Needless to say, I did not appreciate this condescending attitude of hers and outright dismissing my solution to finishing a hot coffee on time and called her out on the matter, but she refused to listen and said she wanted to finish her lunch. A minute later, having further processed her toxic behavior she just showed me, I got really upset. And then she played the victim card and proceeded to tell the supervisor over it, as if SHE wasn't the one who provoked it in the first fucking place.

As of now, the supervisor already gave me the chance to hear me out and reported the incident to HR. Whether I'll get fired or not, I'm not sure yet, but considering the absolutely abhorrent attitude I was shown, I think that'll be a blessing in disguise.

I stare at pictures of them and it really gets me going, which is something I’ve never experienced before (didn’t even think it was possible) everything they do is kind of sexy, even just watching them drink their coffee, to name a few things.

Over the past year, in my spare time, I’ve built an autonomous trading system based on AI agents from scratch. I’m not a ""classic"" programmer, a quant, or a guru. My main skill has been orchestrating AI models, getting them to reason together, testing, failing, and fixing. 

It’s what people are calling ""vibe coding"" right now, for better or worse.

In general, since I move around so much, I crave having some stability and stable community no matter where I am, and in Kettering this has turned out to be the little cafe, Bewiched.

The name dragged me in the first time I came across it, and now it’s a must do before every shift. I quickly started to jam with the staff. Because my daughters both work in hospitality, I know the staff side of things, and so always try to brighten their day in any which way I can.

The now manager of the cafe, Irena, had a cat, an old and temperamental female called Sweetie. Since  Irena  found out I’m a vet, she asked me advice sometimes, and this turned into some home visits, and then she ended up going to my vet’s practice with Sweetie so I could supervise her treatments.

Irena has a really funny and dark sense of humor, very much like mine, so between cafes and cat we have bonded quite a lot!

Now I go to Bewiched on Sunday afternoons after they close, and before my shift, to sit and read, drink coffee and spend time with Irena while she closes up the week, and after we walk back together, me to my shift, and her home to Sweetie.

Another thing we have in common and can talk for hours about, is our passion for fantasy books! Fae, sirens and dragons are a frequent part of our conversations, which I love considering we’re two adult women with jobs and responsibilities 😅

Irena is from the Czech Republic, so we also share being foreigners in the UK.

Our first date was effortless. There was no awkward silences, great conversation. We kept meeting after that for coffee, late-night ice cream, and just spending time together. He’s come over to my place, we’ve cuddled, and it all felt very natural and comfortable.

After a few months, I asked him what his intentions were because I didn’t want to assume anything. At the time, he was preparing for some interview at work and said he wanted to focus on his career. He told me he doesn’t want anything serious right now, but that he enjoys my company and wants to stay in touch.

After that conversation, I reactivated my dating apps, but honestly, nothing has felt as easy or exciting as what I have with him. I figured maybe staying in touch as friends would be okay. But the problem is, we still flirt occasionally, make plans about hanging out at home, and the dynamic hasn’t really shifted into “just friends.”

What’s making this harder is that I genuinely feel like we’d be really good together as a couple. Our personalities click, we communicate well, and it feels like something that could work if timing weren’t an issue. That’s why I’m struggling to fully detach.

So now I’m stuck in this in-between space. his words say “not serious,” but his actions somewhat keeps blurring the lines.

My questions:

Is it a bad idea to keep this going when he’s already been clear about not wanting a relationship at that point ?

Should I set firmer boundaries or walk away entirely?

I’m looking for honest opinions because I’m genuinely torn and could really use outside perspective.

I’m a single parent planning to move from Providence, RI to Manhattan with my son. I’ve been approved for two apartments, and they’re very different in size, vibe, and location.

A bit about our situation:

My son has cochlear implants and an IEP. He will most likely be attending PS 33 Chelsea Prep and receiving services through the Center for Hearing and Communication for speech therapy in downtown Manhattan, along with regular visits to his audiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian uptown. Transportation is provided for school.

The two apartments:

Option 1: Hell’s Kitchen (West 49th St, Midtown West)
Smaller two-bedroom apartment with no separate living room or dining room
Very compact layout. When you walk in, you’re immediately in the kitchen, with a bedroom on each side and a very small bathroom
Two small closets and essentially no storage space
Very central location
About 15 minutes from school and services
Extremely close to major subway lines
Busy area with tourists and lots of activity
No laundry in the unit or building
Feels safer to me personally when walking around with my son, even though it’s crowded

The biggest concern with this option is how cramped it feels. There’s very little room for storage, and realistically no space for many of the things I currently own.

Option 2: Harlem (West 140th St near Malcolm X Blvd)
Much larger apartment
Separate living room and dining area
Seven large closets with lots of storage
Laundry in the basement
Quieter, more residential feel
Further from school and services
Still Manhattan, but less central
I didn’t like the overall vibe walking around the area and felt more on high alert

What I’m trying to balance:

Safety, especially walking with my son
Daily logistics like school, therapy, and appointments
Quality of life for my child
My own mental health and energy. I feel very stagnant in Providence and want to feel more alive again

My son handles noise and activity well and doesn’t need a lot of decompression space at home. I tend to feel more energized in active areas with things going on. I also work independently and rely a lot on being out in the city, such as gyms, coffee shops, libraries, and transit hubs, just being around people and activity. I’ve learned that I function better mentally and professionally when I’m in a more central, active area rather than somewhere quieter and more residential.

I know the Harlem apartment is objectively bigger and more comfortable, but the Midtown one feels more connected and more efficient for day-to-day life. At the same time, the lack of space and storage in the Hell’s Kitchen apartment is my biggest hesitation.

If you were in my position, especially parents, people familiar with NYC schools or IEPs, or anyone who has lived in both Midtown West and Harlem, which would you choose and why?

I’m not looking for perfect answers, just real-world perspectives.

Thanks in advance.🙏

 august of 2023 i started talking to my now boyfriend of a year and a half and when my mom found out she told my dad and they verbally and physically abused me to no end and basically put me on house arrest for months because he is not practicing the same religion as i grew up with. i didn’t get to celebrate my golden birthday, all i could do was go to school and come home. couldn’t even go get a quick iced coffee 10 mins away. so i got a job started saving and planning a way to move out, but life and self doubt always got in the way. I ended up quitting my job this past july because i was overworked and they did not want to meet my schedule needs as a student so i’ve been unemployed since then. 

I couldn’t care less about his religion, my boyfriend is the most gentle patient kind hearted soul and my parents put us through a lot but we’ve stuck it out because we see a real future together. I wasn’t going to leave him just because my parents told me to, they’ve controlled me for way too long and this is where i drew the line. 

fast forward to now and things have settled a little, there’s fights and arguments here and there but i’ve stood my ground. spring semester begins in one day and my parents tell me that im going to have to take out loans to pay for school now because as long as i am with my boyfriend they refuse to pay for my college, (a local commuter college that i didnt even want to go to but i did for them because it was safer financially and we had agreed they’d pay for it to save me from student debt). 

i have three older siblings who all either have or are pursuing their masters, my parents paid for it all. but because i am not doing as i’m told im being punished, my parents don’t know what unconditional love is. This is just the tip of the iceberg, my dad has spit on me, called me a failure, and has told me multiple times to die and he hopes i get cancer. 

I feel like i’m just in this cycle of arguing with them ->then they act like nothing is wrong -> then i assume we’re fine, and we are for a couple months, -> but then something even worse happens. 

I feel like they’ve ruined my life, i had no real high school experience, didn’t even get to go to the college i wanted, and don’t even know if what im studying is really what i want to pursue. 

I could be in the same student debt far away from them and much happier, but they fucked me over.

I want this to end, i want to leave and go no contact but i don’t even know where to start because they raised me to be financially dependent on them, they never allowed me to get a job until i was 20. I have some savings i was going to use for a car but now that im paying for my own school i think ill have to use it for that. 

It just feels like they pulled the rug from under me right as i saw the light at the end of the tunnel, ive been so depressed for so long and i just lost a very close family member and its like… they are so heartless. Im just so tired of living like this and i dont know where to start its all just too much.

I am planning on getting a job and my first big thing is getting my own car but i just feel lost so any advice or similar stories would help.

1qgyv8l,https://i.redd.it/nnotnv7xp9eg1.jpeg,"The Secret Sauce of Motion Design Commercials? Humor, Baby!","You ever watch a motion design ad and think, “Wow… that actually made me laugh AND want to buy something?” No? Just me? Okay, maybe it’s just me… but humor in commercials is the underrated superhero of motion design, and today, I’m gonna break it down like a stand-up routine.

 Why We Crave Laughs in 3 Seconds or Less

Let’s be honest: attention spans are shorter than the lifespan of a TikTok trend. People scroll, they swipe, they judge your ad in less time than it takes to boil an egg. So what gets their attention? Humor.

Think about it: you’re watching a 10-second animation of a cat juggling donuts in zero gravity. You laugh. You remember the brand. You might even buy a donut subscription you didn’t know you needed. That’s the power of a punchline in motion design.

\---

The Mechanics: How Humor Transforms Motion Design

Humor isn’t just slapping a funny face on a product. It’s a combination of timing, exaggeration, and relatability.

1. Timing is everything – A split-second delay can make or break a joke.

2. Exaggeration – Physics? Who needs it when a toaster can fly across the room?

3. Relatability – “I hate Mondays, and I hate my coffee, but this coffee mug understands me.”

In motion design, these elements are animated to perfection. The eyes follow, the brain laughs, the wallet opens.

\> Fun fact: Ads with unexpected visual twists are basically the motion design version of “Wait… what?”—and apparently, people buy more when they say that.

The Stand-Up Moment: A Joke in Motion

Picture this: you’re animating a blender. Not just any blender… a blender that dances to your grocery list. It moonwalks past the bananas, spins the spinach like a DJ… and just as it’s about to throw the kale, the kale waves at the audience.

Do people need to buy a blender? Maybe. Do they remember it? Absolutely. Humor + motion = brand stickiness that no static photo could ever achieve.

 Humor Isn’t Optional, It’s Essential

Here’s the truth: motion design without humor is like a joke without a punchline. People scroll past, mute the sound, and forget it ever existed. But make them laugh? Suddenly, your brand is that friend who tells the best stories at a party… and also happens to sell… whatever it is you’re selling.

So next time you animate that product commercial, remember: timing, exaggeration, relatability—and a little absurdity—go a long way.",1,1768811908.0,LogoMotionGraphics,1,1.0,False
1qgytxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1qgytxe/very_obscure_book_ive_been_trying_to_find/,very obscure book I've been trying to find,"this is from YEARS ago and I doubt anyone knows it because the information I provide is very vague. I apologies, it's been ages and the book itself has complicated words and I was still like 14 when I read it lol

it's like about this girl with some kind of problem, I presume mental problem? I don't remember if it's hospital or mental asylum

I found this book from an artist's header picture which is the quote from the book

the quote I also forgot, it's something like ""medicinal scent"" that reminded her to the past because it has the same scent. and then I THINK something about coffee in the quote too

the book itself is very short. maybe less than 100 pages, more or less. I finished reading it in a few hours. it's also not like a usual novel. abstract structure, like some pages only has a few sentences and blank parts. paragraphs are kind of rare

I remember small scene of the girl trying to m.sturbate (not sure if I can write it here) but not really find pleasure in it. or she can only do that and had nothing else to do. she also consume meds I think. it's also first person view, if I recall

if my memory serves me right, a play has been made out of it..? I remember vaguely when I searched the title the wiki says a play has been of it. I'm not sure

I apologize for my bad english, not a native speaker. any clue or help is appreciated! you can probe me more for details, though I'm not sure if I can provide any more clue since, again, very fuzzy memory",2,1768811772.0,whatsthatbook,2,1.0,False

1qgysa1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgysa1,How I play Jules and some of my final boards,"My last post got way more traction than I expected. I've heard five different streamers talking about Jules because of it and some people asked for a guide or strategies. Last season, I only finished rank 92 playing Jules. I am not a versatile or creative player and, therefore, **I am not a good enough player** to be making a guide on Jules (compared to the likes of Rahresh - the GOAT -, Urmia, Classy, Sixten, Jota and so on). If I can't find my items, I lose the game - if those guys cant find their items, they win anyway. 

That being said, I can show some of my final boards from this season and talk a bit about how I play Jules. So **this is not quite a ""guide""**, even though I may use ""you should"" or ""you shouldn't"" in writing. **Take everything I say with a grain of salt** (and my bad if I commited any mistakes or forgot something). I hope this can help those who are trying to lean Jules!

The pictures are 6 Giant Lollipop games, 4 Fruit Press games, 3 Freezer games, a Feast game and my only meme build of the season (which was also somewhat of a highroll) for the LOLs. I tried to include boards with different items/skills and of different strengths to show some variety.



**Some thoughts on Jules' win conditions**

I believe **Giant Lollipop** is by far her most consistent win condition, although **Fruit Press** can be equally as strong. Because Lollipop is a food, you can use a variety of items to CDR it, give it crit and charge it. There are also some slow-related skills that work perfectly with Lollipop. Besides, you don't need to scale your base damage or find Veggie Garden for it to be an insane late-game item.

In my opinion, **Freezer** is not as consistent as the other two win-cons. As Rahresh said in his last stream, you need two things while playing Freezer, besides the item itself: Blender and scaling. You can tempo-10 without one of those, but to play it in the late game, you pretty much always need both and they are not the most consistent things to find. As far as I understand, Freezer doesn't have the 1- or 2-shot potential that the Press and Lollipop have (unless you really highroll) and you can't really rely on charge skills/items, so you can be easily slowed and outscaled (one of my losses this season was exactly with a Freezer build to a slow/burn Vanessa followed by a Pyg with looping and scaling Pants).

**Feast** is, in my opinion, Jules' 4th best win condition and the easiest one. It is super, super easy to play and it doesn't really require any skills or other large items. It is the easiest build to transition into from my early game lines. This is more of a tempo item, but if you have crit, Meat Tenderizer, perma-haste and maybe a defensive enchant, you can actually go late. Pantry/Oven make it even easier. The enchants on this item are also really good.

I only play around those win-cons and my early game is shaped by the assumption that I’ll be playing one of those items. So, I sometimes take useless skills (damage skills, Righty Tighty and so on) and semi-useless items early (like Spatula, Meat Tenderizer, Slushee, Sorbet or any slow item) just because I may play them with one of those 4 win conditions later.

Jules has other fine builds that I don't play. Pantry and Oven are Jules' Sampler, that is to say, two of her best items. You can make any build work with them but you can also make strong boards even stronger. 



**Day 1**

* **Mittel** is the best shop, followed by **Valpak** (free small items - I buy all of them) and **Hela**. I never click on Aila and never play for weapons (it's good tempo if you find your damage scaling tools, but it seems to transition poorly to the late-game builds I play). Other merchants are okay, but you should give preference to **money nodes** (unless you see Mittel or Valpak), especially before the fight. **Skill nodes** are also great, especially after the fight and if you have items already.
* Your best **medium items** include, in order of importance to me: **Toaster** and **Skillet** (items that are good from day 1 through the mid-game), **Microwave** and **Vintage** (items for later and to quest Lollipop), as well as situational picks like **Prep Station** (mid burn scaling but okay survivability), **Pumpkin** (great reworked item that works well with shield/regen items, including offensive ones like LauLau and Pie), **Basket** (I hate this item, I only play it on days 1-2 for the base numbers and never quest it, but people seem to like it for some reason - Vintage in a cooled spot seems much better to me, and other items have higher procs per second per board space in the late game) and **Blueberry Pie** (mid item, but you can make it work for some days if you have shield scaling). **Rice Cooker** and **Rolling Pin/Rice** are also fine if you find them in the same rotation in the shop or if you already have haste items - otherwise, don't try to force them. **Pasta Maker**, especially if cheap, can be a really good eco item but I am usually too lazy to hold it, so I don't buy it.
* Your best small items include, in order of importance to me: **Noodles** (Jules' BEST item!!!), **Scorchpepper**, **Coffee**, **Black Pepper**, **Banu Leaves**, **Butter**, **Strawberries** (insane base values for day 1), **LauLau** (especially with scaling), **Hot Sauce**, and situational picks like **Skewer** (if heated and if you have a damage skill), **Pancakes/Baked Potato** (if heated and with Toaster), **Trail Mix** (good base values if you don't have scaling or shield items) and random tools (if you have Prep Station). **Cookie Cutters** are great for health and in case you find Press!
* Your best fight, by far, is **Pyro**. **Kyver Drone** and **Haunted Kimono** are also great (because of Trained and money/scrap). **Banannibal** can be fine if you get Tape.
* Click on the furry monster if you can and for the level-up reward, I pretty much always go for skills. Enchanted items are fine and can lead to some highrolls, but +2 gold and one out of 8 skills is too consistent. The best (almost insta-buy) skill is **Protein Powder** (it pretty much guarantees days 2 and 3 just because of your health advantage and you won't even need to buy chocolate ever - or you can do it just to have even more health). Then, **burn and damage skills** are the picks. If I have burn scaling or Cinders, I prefer to take Left/Right-Handed rather than burn even if it is completely useless right now, because I can always play Fruit Press or Freezer later. If I am lacking burn, I take a burn skill. Shield skills are situationally good too, with Banu, Pancakes and Tape, for instance.
* Try to play **at least one shield item** in most of your early game boards (if you don't, you may lose fights to other burn builds that have shielding even if you are burning more). 



**Day 2/3/4**

* Improve your board with the small and medium items mentioned. A combination of some items is pretty much in all my early boards: Toaster, Skillet, Noodles, Microwave, Vintage, Coffee, Butter, Black Pepper and Banu Leaves. Toaster is, in my opinion, the best burn scaling item Jules has - just because you can find it at bronze. Its only competition is with **Pickled Peppers** \- which has better numbers, especially at gold, besides being able to be hasted by Microwave.
* The bigger your Noodles or Skillet are, the better, so **always go +burn nodes** (always take **Conflagration** if you see it and Improvised Burn and Searing Flames can be fine skills too). Shadowed Cloak + a fat Noodles is a real thing. 
* Some other silver-starting items (like Burrito, Azakan Stew, Pizza and Bread) can also be good, although I would rather have the items I mentioned before, unless I get Conflag. I hate Jambalaya (it is too RNG), but it can be situationally fine. **Always buy a Cookbook** (you don't want to have your items stuck at bronze, which happens a lot) **and almost always buy Blender if you see one.** Sometimes, there is a random **Whisk** on my board, especially if I have damage skills or scaling (like Trained), because this item is absolutely broken and can destroy shield.
* I pretty much never go to Likit, unless I have either Saffron or a win condition. 
* **Almost always buy silver chocolate at least on day 3**. 
* **I start going for Aila on day 3, actively looking for either Press or Lollipop** (although Medium and Large shops can also be good, as well as Orion for Press). If you find one of those, you can commit to it and start looking for items/skills that go well with it (I'll talk more about those later).
* Always fight the **Frost Street Challenger on day 3**. It has a 1/3 chance to drop either **Snowstorm** or the **Frozen Bludgeon**, which allows you to play Freezer.
* **What to upgrade on day 3** is extremely important. Jules has some items that pretty much double their strength if you upgrade them to silver, so focus on those items instead of others (even if they are items that you will probably be playing in the mid-late game, like Microwave and Black Pepper). Some of those items, in order of importance to me, are: **Toaster**, **Prep Station**, **Coffee**, **Skillet**, **Noodles** and, situationally, Pumpkin, Rice and Rolling Pin. Upgrading Vintage can also be good, as it doubles its shield.
* If you have Vintage, Lollipop, Press, Microwave, Knife Sharpener and/or Coffee, **Curio is one of your best nodes**. You can also find **Frozen Bludgeon** (which allows you to play Freezer) - and an **Icicle** is always good.
* If you find Lollipop, you should be questing it by going to every easy fight, not playing any real damage items and focusing on hasting and charging your Vintage (or another slow item). Meat Tenderizer is also great to CDR your slow item.



**Day 5 and onwards**

* **Don't spend too much money on Day 5**. Regardless of whether you found your win-condition or not, you will need the money for large gold items on Day 6.
* On Day 6, if you found either Lollipop or Press, **look aggressively for** **Dishwasher** and, in the case of Press, **Veggie Garden**. Keep looking for other items and skills that go well with your win condition in the late game. When to swap from the burn line to those win conditions is situational, but I try doing it if my board is falling off and if I found my key items/skills that go with them.
* If you have good base damage, Snowstorm or Frozen Bludgeon and also Blender, you can **look aggressively for Freezer**. If you only have one of those, you can try playing Freezer, but it can be risky, especially if you have already lost some days. If you have none of those and not even Ice Cubes, Slushees or Sorbets, don't force Freezer!
* If you didn't find the aforementioned win-cons, you can also play **Feast**. If you can't find it either, you may consider playing another large gold-starting item for tempo until you find something actually good - I like Gingerbread House for tempo.
* If you find a really late Lollipop, and you don't have anything else, try to quest it. **It is never too late to quest Lollipop!** (especially if you can find Bubblegum Floor)
* You should pretty much **never sell a ticket** if you get one, considering Obsidian is your best enchant. You should go for the Temple only if you've found your win-con (or if you really want to gamble on finding Blazehowl Warden). Otherwise, keep going for shops.
* If you don't have your win-con, always go for Dragon on day 8. Draconic Rage and Dragon Heart can save some runs.
* If I can't find anything good after days 7, 8 or 9, it's pretty much over for me. That is what caused my second loss this season. But, apparently, not finding anything good is something that rarely occurs.
* If you find your items and skills, the rest of the game should be pretty smooth (unless you fight even stronger boards, which sometimes happens). Focus on improving your board (by getting crit, CDR, upgrades, enchants, better items and so on) as well as getting more health.



**Items, skills and enchants**

***Giant Lollipop***

* Focus on your health and on your level. The higher level you are, the higher your damage is.
* **Dishwasher** is, by far, the best item to play with Lollipop. Other items, in order of how highly I value them, include: **Pantry**, **Chocolate Coins**, **Spatula**, **Meat Tenderizer**, **Black Pepper**, **Pizza Cutter**, **Coffee**, **Food Truck**, **Jumbo Wok**, **Oven**, **Caviar**, Decanter, Spice Rack, Cornucopia, Egg Timer and Herb Shears. If your Lollipop can be in a cooled spot, **Refrigerator** is also great. Ice cubes and Honeycomb can be good CC. Other hero items, like Holsters, Icicle, Korxena Crest, Silencer and so on, are also great. You can get creative! If you don’t manage to find Dishwasher, having permanent haste, a solid enchant, crit and plenty of charge should be enough to carry most games.
* The easiest, and one of the best, Lollipop skills to have is **Righty-Tighty**. It does mean, however, that you may need to leave some empty spaces on your board, depending on where your heated spot is positioned. Other good skills are: **Big Guns**, **Shield Bash**, **Temporal Strike**, **Quick Bite** and **Mixed Messages**. **Zara** and **Slohmor Lumbra** are your best friends. Skills that give crit, cooldown reduction, haste and CC immunity are also great, and there are a lot of them.
* **Obsidian** is the best enchant and **Shiny** is a bit worse. After that, **Restorative/Shielded**, **Deadly** (almost never on the Lollipop itself, but rather on the dishwasher/coffee) and **Radiant** (either on the dishwasher/coffee, in case you are going to the Temple, or on the Lollipop itself) are almost equally as strong and which one to choose is situational. Fiery, Toxic and Icy are mid. Turbo can actually be good with Food Cart - otherwise, it's bad. Slow is the worst one - you can just go to Curio!

***Fruit Press***

* Almost always go to every +damage node you find and if you have **Veggie Garden**, also focus on health/level.
* **Dishwasher** is also the best item for Press, followed closely by **Veggie Garden**. If you can only find one of them, it is mostly fine. After those, **Chocolate Coins**, **Oven**, **Black Pepper**, **Coffee** and, situationally, **Knife Sharpener** are the best ones. **2-second cooldown items** (Cookies, Noodles, Eggs and Ice Cubes) are great to scale your damage, especially early in the game. Before finding Dishwasher, I like playing **Microwave** to haste all my board but the Press. You can also play some items from other heroes, as long as you still have enough foods on board to actually kill. Holsters is particularly good with Workin' Hard if you only have 1 large item.
* **Shield Bash**, **Mixed Messages**, **Quick Bite** and, situationally, **Temporal Strike** are good skills. But you can also go for **Workin' Hard**, which is good and easier to find, although it can also charge Dishwasher. There are some damage skills that you should be looking for besides **Left/Right-Handed** and sometimes **Strength**, like **Iron Sharpens Iron** and **War Chef.**
* The enchants are pretty much the same as for Lollipop. I just value **Radiant** a little bit more because there are fewer charge items and skills - so you are weaker to slows.

***Freezer***

* **Temple** is even better if you have Freezer because you can get both Nullfrost Altar and Darkstone Focuser. 
* I value these items the most: **Blender**, **Frozen Bludgeon**, **Pastry Cart**, **Slushees**, **Ice Cubes**, **Noodles**, **Butter**, **Dishwasher** (yes, you can also play it with Freezer depending on your heated spot), **Banu Leaves**, **Sorbet** and **Mini Fridge**. I've heard **Veggie Garden**, **Food Truck** and even **Pantry** are good with freezer, but I haven't tried them yet. If you can't find Blender or if you don't have the second cooled spot, Microwave can be fine for some days depending on your heated spot. Start of combat freeze items (Icicle or Magma Core, Clamera and Holster + their respective freeze skills) are insane with Blender for start of combat haste. There are a lot of items from other heroes that go well with Freezer - Iceberg and Stopwatch are the better ones I've played.
* Base damage skills (**Right/Left-handed**, **Strength**, **Iron Sharpens Iron** and **War Chef**) are good, but scaling ones (**Shatter**, **Snowstorm**, **Sharp Corners** and situationally **Slow and Steady** \- with a slow enchant - and **Improvised Weaponry** \- with Reaching the Summit) are better. Freeze skills are obviously good. **Big Guns** is insane.
* **Shiny** and **Obsidian** are the same and equally strong. **Icy** is also good. **Shielded** is your fourth best enchant and **Restorative** is the fifth. After that, **Radiant** and **Heavy** are my favorites (a Radiant enchant can save you from slow/freeze builds and Heavy can make your CC even better). Turbo is fine if you don't have Blender. Fiery and Toxic are mid. Deadly is pretty much only good if you have Improvised Weaponry. Enchanting Pastry Cart can have some similar effects, in case you want to keep the Freezer enchant open.

***Feast***

* Upgrade this item as soon as you can - it gets twice as strong.
* I value the most: **Pantry, Oven,** **Meat Tenderizer**, **Scorchpepper**, **Microwave**, **Chocolate Coins**, **Spatula**, **Noodles** and other 2s cooldown items, **Butter**, **Universal Sauce + Zarlic**, **Banu Leaves**, **Black Pepper**, **Pizza Cutter,** **Egg Timer**, **Coffee**, **Caviar**, **Hot Sauce** and **Bread Knife**. This is probably the best build to play Holsters with, but, with the exception of that item and something like Soul Ring, Ni-Kola and Korxena Crest, most other hero items should not be played in this build.
* You don't really require any skills! However, **Workin' Hard** can be good for Meat Tenderizer and Microwave.
* This item has insane enchants. **Shielded**, **Restorative** and **Obsidian** are 5x the value of the burn + 5x the value of regen, so it is pretty much 10x the value of your burn. **Shiny** is just double everything. **Toxic** is funny: you get 2x your burn values on poison, so it is probably better than the basic **Fiery** (double the burn) enchant. **Deadly** is good but probably should be put into another item (like the Microwave), **Turbo** and **Heavy** are targets 3 items for 1s. Radiant is fine and Icy is mid.



I’m going to get back to playing the game now instead of just thinking about it - writing this cost me 50 ranks. I don't really care about my rank, but my goal is to reach an all-time win rate of 80% on Jules (I’m currently at 78% - my first games with Jules when she launched weren't the best, so it’s been a long process to increase my win rate). Take care, everyone!",6,1768811595.0,PlayTheBazaar,3,0.8,False

I've joined the APS this year from the private sector and I'm struggling a bit to adjust to my new team.

My previous private role had a great culture but was very office based, so far I've found it hard to find stuff in common and build repore with other team members, particularly with hybrid work. Additionally, I'm the only male in the team besides the EL2. 

I've also found the TL hasn't been the best in helping me settle in i.e. not inviting me out for coffees (only seems to go with her friends or other equilavent level) or introducing me to the other team members when I started.

Everyone seems nice enough so perhaps it just may take a bit of time? 

Any advice would be appreciated.

I will establish a consistent 6 AM - 8 AM morning routine for 60 consecutive days including exercise, journaling, and focused work to maximize productivity.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Days 1-15: Wake at 6 AM daily (no snooze), 20-minute workout, cold shower, 10-minute journal, coffee, 60-minute deep work session.  
Days 16-30: Refine routine timing, add gratitude practice to journal, optimize breakfast prep, protect deep work time (no email/Slack).  
Days 31-45: Maintain consistency on weekends too, track productivity metrics (tasks completed), notice energy level improvements.  
Days 46-60: Perfect the system, document benefits, create backup plan for travel/disruptions, commit to 90-day extension.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Daily check-in photos — timestamped selfies at 6:05 AM showing wakeup time for all 60 days (can be compiled into video).
2. Workout app screenshots — Strava/Apple Fitness showing 60 morning workouts logged.
3. Journal entries — photos of handwritten journal (or digital screenshots) showing 60 daily entries.
4. Productivity tracker — spreadsheet showing deep work hours completed each morning (minimum 40 hours total over 60 days).
5. Weekly energy level ratings — self-assessment (1-10 scale) tracking increased energy and focus.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Oversleeping — place alarm across room requiring standup, go to bed 10 PM strict, no phone in bedroom, accountability partner texts 6:05 AM.  
Low energy initially — expect adjustment period Week 1-2, drink water immediately upon waking, light exercise acceptable first week.  
Weekends temptation to sleep in — keep same schedule 7 days/week, remember productivity gains worth temporary sacrifice, social events scheduled afternoons.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Even use our CDC vouchers and log into our CDP account also need to type in our Singpass password.

Do you think it is safe to type in our Singpass password in the CMB app? Do you think it is very safe to verify your identity through Singpass in the CMB app?

2) If you don't type in your Singpass password and if you don't verify your identity through Singpass in the CMB app, then those  Singaporeans female members that had verified their identity through Singpass themselves, is it they cannot see your profile??",2,1768811278.0,SingaporeCitizens,6,0.67,False

I get the lane situation is confusing but almost everytime I drive this people cut in from the right and get angry / beep at me... There are signs that in my opinion are quite clear (all be it a bit too early maybe?) further up Leith Street. Anyway sorry for my morning rant, there are more important things going on in the world... i'll go and have some coffee. Here is some lovely art work below highlighting 1. the correct lane flow and 2. how ridiculously over engineered this ""roundabout"" is.

1qgymcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leipzig/comments/1qgymcv/opening_an_art_shop_in_leipzig/,Opening an art shop in Leipzig,"Hello everyone,

I'm sorry if I'm here asking a question that has been posted many times.  
I know there is no a simple answer for this, so I'll try to be very specific for my request. 

My girlfriend is thinking to open a little art shop, which already exists online. We are in Italy, and we don't think this is the right place to see a bright future for us and our project, so our first thought was Berlin. But then, of course, we also thought that costs would be crazy there, so we came up with Leipzig. 

Our idea is just to give a physical location to this online shop, which sell sculptures and design home decorations, but also ceramic jewels. So we would need an easy, small location that could allow her to make this stuff, to have a little showcase for customers and - we thought - to have a very small coffee area, where people could take a specialty coffee to go and some bakery goods (bought elsewhere). First this coffee part would be a very small part of it, but then with time it could be expanded (also for regulations in selling foods and other legal stuff).

We're already working to moodboards and business plan, to better pitch this project. All of these in English cause we for now don't know German (but we're starting).

I've been reading that opening a place in Germany is pretty much easy, but burocracy could be a real pain (but this is everywhere I guess) and, in general, German politics is not very keen to help building new small business. But I also read about the art scene in Leipzig and financial aid, and it seems such a nice place to start something. I don't know if any of those things are true, cause I'm still in the initial phase of clearing my mind and all, but I'm a little afraid of that, also because we're not rich and goes on this adventure could be a real hazard for us; we would have to ask for some help from our families and we're currently put our money aside for this, but we simply cannot fail.

We read about financial aid for these kind of project, and also I've been read about financial aid for women who are looking to start a business. Everything makes me thing to a supportive State/city, which is something in Italy you don't get very much. Do you know how much real are these aid?

In general: seeing the size of it and all things considered, we are looking at a nice project or is it just a big risk?

I'm kindly ask for your thoughts and/or suggestions!  
Many thanks.",2,1768810981.0,Leipzig,3,0.63,False

I really like how it came out, and I think the coffee cake topping is holding it together than an under baked mess.  Is it possibly underbaked? The knife came out dry and this is shorter and wider than the loaf.",2,1768810975.0,Baking,1,1.0,False

I don't know the sound of your laugh, the rhythm of your voice, or the way your eyes light up when you're lost in something you love. But I think about you more often than I care to admit.

You're a mystery I'm aching to unfold, page by page, day by day. I imagine the way your hand might fit in mine, the way our conversations might stretch into the early morning hours, effortless and infinite.

I'm not looking for perfection. I'm looking for something real. Someone who will see the mess and the beauty in me and choose to stay anyway. Someone I can build a quiet and steady kind of magic with, a love that feels like home.

You've been dancing around the edges of my imagination. I want to learn all your quirks, your go-to coffee order, the way your voice changes when you talk about something you're passionate about. I want to tease you, challenge you, make you laugh until you can't breathe..

I like a woman who knows what she wants. Even more, I like a woman who can keep up. So whenever we finally meet, don’t be shy. Bring that fire. And talk to me like no one else exists.

I want soft mornings. I want banter that turns into kisses. I want to make you feel seen and desired. You deserve someone who never stops choosing you. Every. Single. Day.

Just one thing, my love: I don’t do halfway. I want all of you, or nothing at all. I’m someone who won’t just love you, but will cherish you. Who will protect your heart like it’s a fragile miracle. Because that’s what I believe love should be, a sanctuary, not a battlefield.

So take your time. But not too much time, l'm getting a little impatient over here lol.

Wherever you are, I hope to hear from you soon.

Until our worlds collide,
