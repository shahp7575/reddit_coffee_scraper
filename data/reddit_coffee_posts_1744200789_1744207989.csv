WT* do I do?","So a couple of months ago I picked up a hot girl on femdox - you know, one of those ""mutually agreed upon"" offers. I wasn't expecting anything deep — just wanted to blow off steam and not deal with the usual dating BS. Matched with this girl, super cute, funny, kinda dark humor. We chatted a bit and she was like, “Yeah, I'm down, just need a bit of support now and then.” Boom, we met, did the deed — she was cool, no drama.

I told myself, “Don't get weird, bro. It's just transactional. She’s basically like an es\*\*t but without the heels and hotel lobbies.”

But then… she started texting me. Not in a creepy way, just little stuff — “Hey, how’s your day?”, “Hope you're okay,” or sometimes venting a bit. At first I thought it was just to keep me hooked as a “regular,” but she wasn’t even asking for more money. Just... talking. Being real. Which messed me up.

Next thing I know, we’re hanging out without even hooking up. Coffee runs, random walks, late-night convos. I’d make excuses like “I’m just being nice” but deep down, I started catching f\*\*king feelings. Hard.

Tried to pull back — ghosted her for a few days. She hit me up with a sad-ass message like “Did I do something wrong?” and damn, it hurt. I’m like, bro, this wasn’t supposed to happen. She’s not my girlfriend. This is some femdox chick I met in the middle of a low-key crisis. But now I’m thinking about her all the damn time.

She’s still in that world, or at least I think she is. She never lied about it. But like... can I really be in a relationship with someone who gets intimate with other dudes for money? Even if she’s trying to get out?

I don’t know, man. I feel like a clown. But also... maybe this is real?

What the hell do I do, Reddit? Anyone else been down this road? Should I walk away or just see where it goes? 😵‍💫

A little about me:

I’m a 27-year-old guy from the Netherlands, currently living in Arnhem (originally from Amsterdam). I’m tall—2.05m (6’8”)—and around 120kg. In my free time, I enjoy gaming, making music, and going out with friends. I never had a relationship, went on a date and don't have much luck tbh. So I'm looking for a relationship on reddit. I can be a bit quiet and really open up when I get to know you.

What I’m looking for:

I’m hoping to meet a kind, down-to-earth woman who's interested in building a connection that could lead to something meaningful. I don’t have a strict “type,” but I do appreciate someone who takes care of themselves and has a good sense of humour. Being open-minded and able to enjoy conversations is a big plus!

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone who’s also looking to explore a relationship at a natural pace—no pressure, just seeing where things go. Whether it's getting to know each other over coffee, sharing some laughs while gaming, or going for a walk, I value genuine connection above all.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to send me a DM and tell me a bit about yourself. Looking forward to chatting and hopefully getting to know someone special.",1,1744207695.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I’ve officially fallen down the rabbit hole. It started with playing Good Coffee Great Coffee and spiralled into late-night YouTube binges of James Hoffmann, Coffee Kev, Tom’s Coffee Corner, Lifestyle Lab, Lance Hedrick… you get the idea.

One minute I’m using my Nespresso Pixie, the next I’m googling espresso scales and portafilters.

Now I’m ready to buy my first real espresso machine and I’m **TOTALLY** overwhelmed.

Here’s what I’m looking at (all with integrated grinders....groan - space issue!):

* **Sage Barista Touch Impress** – £850 down from £1,100 ($1000 down from $1400)
* **Sage Barista Pro**
* **Sage Barista Express Impress**

I’m leaning toward **Sage/(US: Breville)** as a solid entry point. I know a separate grinder is ideal, but there’s no space for one in my apartment…maybe in a couple of years.

I’ve seen some worrying reviews here (especially on the **Touch Impress**), and I’m getting a bit jittery.....and not from a great shot. Am I overthinking it?

What I care about:

**Habits:** Two coffees a day when I’m home. One in the AM; one in the PM. I work from home two days a week and I’m home all weekend. On office days I’m usually rushing, so I need something quick. Tinkering and experimenting will be a weekend thing.

**Tastes:** I like espresso, and I love milk-based drinks like flat whites, cappuccinos, lattes. I only order milk drinks at cafés (and only from specialty coffee shops, never Starbucks!). I didn’t bother with milk drinks at home because I hated the Aeroccino frother.

**Skill level:** Total n00b. Never pulled a shot or steamed milk. Keen to learn, but if milk steaming is too hard I will probably lose motivation. I’ve been deep in a YT hole, but haven’t made anything café-quality…yet.

**Practical stuff:** 

* I live alone now, but (if my parents get their way) I might have a partner in future who’ll use the machine too.
* I’d love to be able to make coffee for friends when they visit.
* My parents only drink decaf, so being able to switch between beans would be useful.
* I need something with longevity. This is a decent investment and I don’t want to feel the need to upgrade in 12 months.

**So… what do you think?**

Is the Touch Impress worth it at £850? Is the Express Impress a better beginner option? Is the Pro the right middle ground? Or… do I throw this list out and start again?

1jv6mtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkLittleHorrorStory/comments/1jv6mtw/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1744207592.0,DarkLittleHorrorStory,1,1.0,False

And if you never want to see him again, it enables you to walk off without any sort of lingering annoyance from either party.

For a second date, it is often dinner or something pricier. Get that check - when it arrives, you better be johnny on the spot with your payment method. He will be surprised, but he's also going to be slower than you, probably because he's secretly hoping to split the bill. Astonish him by grabbing it before he has the chance to object. Just say, ""I've got it."" Then if things are going really well, and dinner is over and you're wandering the city and wind up getting another cocktail or something as the evening progresses reassure him that everything is OK by letting him grab that check, if he wants to.

What does this accomplish? Well, if you've been on two dates, you might decide against pursuing things and thereby avoid the whole ""I bought her dinner and she still wouldn't sleep with me"" garbage, if he turns out to be that sort of guy. If he's actually pretty great, you have the opportunity to give him something nice and unexpected, which is fetching. Third, there's a nonzero chance that you'll wind up in a relationship, and it really gets you off on the right foot in terms of splitting expenses, and showing you can uphold your end of a relationship without any of this ""I have to pay for EVERYthing just because I'm a man, it's so unfair"" nonsense.

I did it my whole life, because I have a job and it was no big deal and I was happy to be there, worst case scenario I got to have ice cream. And then one day I bought a glass of champagne for a handsome fellow on our first date. He was more of a beer guy, but he was so surprised to be treated so nicely that he wound up marrying me.",0,1744207569.0,dating,3,0.25,False

A reliable business video surveillance system, like those offered by **Michigan Security Systems**, consists of several essential components that work together to provide all-encompassing security coverage. Our Michigan security systems include security cameras, network video recorders (NVRs), and video management systems (VMS), capturing, storing, and managing video footage to ensure your business in cities like **Detroit, Chesterfield, Warren**, or **Novi, Michigan** is always protected.

**Security Cameras**

Security cameras are at the heart of any surveillance system, particularly in **Michigan businesses**. They prevent theft, monitor activities, and reduce losses by capturing critical video footage. Popular options include dome cameras, bullet cameras, and PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras.

* **Dome Cameras** blend seamlessly into surroundings and offer 360-degree coverage, making them ideal for wide areas in office spaces or showrooms in **Detroit, Michigan**.
* **Bullet Cameras** provide long-range views, perfect for monitoring outdoor areas like parking lots in **Chesterfield or Novi, Michigan**.
* **PTZ Cameras** allow operators to pan, tilt, and zoom in on larger areas and specific details for enhanced coverage, ideal for industrial sites in **Warren, Michigan**. 

Additionally, fisheye cameras deliver a 360-degree field of view, perfect for open spaces, while high-resolution bullet cameras are suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications, ensuring Michigan businesses stay secure day and night.

**Network Video Recorders (NVR)**

NVRs are a critical part of **security systems in Michigan**, offering superior video recording and data management. Businesses in **Detroit, Warren**, and beyond rely on NVR systems as a scalable solution for their needs. With features like Power over Ethernet (PoE), NVRs simplify installation by delivering power and data through a single cable, minimizing infrastructure costs for **security system installers in Michigan** like Michigan Security Systems.

When selecting an NVR, consider the setup size of your Michigan business. **Scalable security systems** like ours are perfect for businesses in **Chesterfield and Novi, Michigan**, looking to expand their surveillance infrastructure over time.

**Video Management Systems (VMS)**

A VMS is the operational hub of any Michigan security system. It provides tools for viewing live and recorded footage, managing alerts, and generating system health reports. Businesses in **Warren, Chesterfield**, and **Detroit, Michigan**, benefit from seamless integration with third-party devices, boosting their functionality.

We offer cloud-based VMS solutions for companies requiring remote access and scalability, while our on-premises VMS ensures greater control and customization. With **Michigan Security Systems**, managing your security setup becomes simple and efficient.

**Choosing the Right Security Camera for Your Michigan Business**

When working with Michigan Security Systems to select security cameras, we focus on your specific needs. Factors like indoor vs. outdoor placement, wired vs. wireless options, and desired resolution play critical roles in designing the best solution for businesses across **Detroit, Warren, Chesterfield**, and **Novi, Michigan**.

**Indoor vs. Outdoor Cameras**

* **Outdoor Cameras** are weather-resistant and vandal-proof, offering robust security for exterior spaces like parking lots or store entrances in **Chesterfield or Warren, Michigan**. 
* **Indoor Cameras** provide high-resolution footage, perfect for securing retail spaces or offices in **Detroit, Michigan**with features such as motion detection and night vision.

**Wired vs. Wireless Cameras**

* **Wired Cameras** provide stable reliability, ideal for larger setups like warehouses in **Novi, Michigan**, but require more comprehensive installation.
* **Wireless Cameras** are a flexible choice for smaller businesses in **Michigan**, such as coffee shops in **Detroit**, where cable installations could be challenging.

**HD vs. UHD Cameras**

* **HD Cameras** are a cost-effective solution, ideal for general surveillance in Michigan's smaller businesses. 
* **UHD Cameras** offer ultra-high resolution, making them perfect for focused security areas, such as entry points or cash registers, in stores and offices across **Michigan**.

**Key Features to Enhance Security Cameras in Michigan**

If you’re upgrading or installing security cameras in **Michigan**, be sure to choose features that maximize performance:

* **Night Vision** ensures clear footage in low-light or nighttime conditions—critical for businesses in **Warren, Michigan**, that operate after dark.
* **Motion Detection** provides real-time alerts for vulnerable zones, like storage areas in **Detroit, Michigan**.
* **Remote Access** allows you to monitor your site in **Chesterfield or Novi, Michigan**, anytime, from anywhere via mobile devices.

Two years ago, I got laid off, and trust me, it wasn’t your run-of-the-mill budget cuts sob story. Picture this: I’m knee-deep in server racks, keeping the company’s ancient infrastructure humming along, when the CEO’s nephew, fresh out of some overpriced MBA program, waltzes in as the new ""IT Visionary."" This kid decides we’re going full cloud overnight, no plan, no clue, just vibes. I push back, explain why a hybrid setup makes more sense for our workload, and next thing I know, I’m packing my desk. Turns out “disruptive innovation” doesn’t include listening to the guy who’s been holding the place together with duct tape and late-night coffee runs. Nepotism 1, John 0.

Luckily, I’d stashed away enough savings to coast for a while. Two years, to be exact. I took some time to decompress, tinker with personal projects, and honestly, just enjoy not being on call 24/7. But savings don’t last forever, so I started hunting for a new gig. First interview rolls around last week, and man, did it throw me for a loop.

The technical stuff? Nailed it. They threw a gnarly troubleshooting scenario at me, something about a misconfigured load balancer tanking half the network, and I walked them through it like I was reciting my grocery list. Passed the assessment with flying colors. But then came the behavioral questions. “Tell us about a time you aligned with company values.” “How do you foster cross-functional synergy?” I froze. I’d spent two years talking to my cat and my home lab, not “leveraging synergies” or “driving stakeholder engagement.” I’d forgotten how to speak corpo. They said I wasn’t a “culture fit.” Translation: I didn’t sound like I’d been marinating in buzzwords. Ouch.

So, I had another interview lined up, and this time, I wasn’t going in cold. A buddy of mine recommended Google’s free Interview Warmup tool, and holy crap, it’s actually useful. It’s like a practice run for your brain. Asks you questions, records your answers, and helps you smooth out the rust. I’d been rambling about “optimizing workflows” and “proactive problem-solving” until I didn’t sound like a hermit who just stumbled out of a server closet. It got me articulating my thoughts again, not just grunting about uptime and patch cycles. For anyone in a similar spot, check it out. It’s free and surprisingly not terrible.

There are deeper tools too, like Pramp or Mindorah, if you want to go full-on mock interview mode. I stuck with the Google tool, and guess what? I crushed that next interview and landed the job. I think these tools in general are very helpfull for us technical folk. Turns out a little practice goes a long way when you’re trying to convince someone you can “pivot strategically” and “champion team goals.”

So here I am, Reddit. Back in the saddle with a new gig, all because I relearned how to talk the talk. Shoutout to that warmup tool for saving my bacon. Now I just need to survive the first week of meetings without accidentally calling a “synergy session” a “waste of time.” Cheers!",5,1744207125.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

I rejected him but it allowed us to have space to be genuine friends. We ended up becoming super close and it was obvious to everyone the bond we had. He was very emotional and I had never been in love so I wasn’t very emotionally intelligent. It led to him being in a relationship with another exchange student from his same country. Our friendship was so close that it no longer seemed appropriate to be this close while he was dating but he refused to sacrifice our friendship. Things got complicated. It led to a year of push and pull that resulted in us having to hide our love. Before he left, He told me I was the most important person in his life next to his family how he will do anything to prove he loves me and he will come back to America for me so we can be together. 4 months after he left everything went to shit. His gf told me he hit her, he was lying to me about things, he was depressed I was angry, and it came to a head and he cut me off. We never talked again
Now 2025, I planned a trip to his country and my anxiety and the sudden repressed feelings bubbling was making it hard for me to plan. I felt compelled to message JH. I sent a detailed message. He responded that he was sorry and his feelings for me were true and he has no excuse for how he acted and if he could go back in time he would change a lot but he can’t so it doesn’t matter now. We planned or maybe grab a coffee when I was there. He said he remembers the time he spent with me the most. How he always looked for me but I was always out of reach so when we had time together it was special. He kept saying he had regrets about what he did but it doesn’t matter. I told him it did matter because in the next life I’ll look for him. And he said ok he will find me. 

Unrelated to this, My bf at the time and I broke up. Right before my trip. JH asked about my relationship. He seemed curious. I asked how he does it. He shared his experience with his relationship. How similar they are so they don’t fight. How he doesn’t believe in soulmates. He said any one I pick to be with wouldn’t be good enough for me. And that I had to the capacity to be the best at anything. By a twist of fate a few of the exchange students were all in town the same week as me so we planned a reunion. I invited him. He said he would let me know his schedule. When I got to his country we talk again. He asked how I liked Korea. He said he had lots of communication with his partner about the reunion and seeing me. And the communication concluded that he can’t make it. That she doesn’t like the idea and she is jealous but he understands her feeling. That he hopes I understand his situation and that it doesn’t affect my feeling or trip. 

I expected this but it hurt to realize I may never see him again. I respond that I understand and respect his situation. Would i be the AH if I send him a message describing what is weighing on my hear",1,1744206578.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

I wanted a clear opinion on what to do, please don't share outside, don't repost, I'd rather it stays rather silent.

  
I've been friend with F (F30) and L (M24) for three years now. We met in a mental facility at the time and kind of hit immediatly.



I met my girlfriend two years ago and C (F26) has been my light ever since. She's made me a better person and have pushed me to better myself. I am an alcoholic. Won't shy away from that, but F is too and we used to go in pub together and get drunk together. It always ended badly because F would talk to men and flirt heavely. I tried to keep her from them as she had a boyfriend and they were rarely good people, they just wanted a fuck with a pretty drunk girl. She would always be apologetic the day after. Sometimes L would join us and he would take her home, chasing away the guys who wanted to go with F.



Thing is F's boyfriend confronted me once at the pub and told me I was a terrible person for making F drink. I stopped going in the pub with F after that. Tried to be a better person, stopped going to pub altogether, which meant I was seeing F and L a lot less. 



I would still take news in DM, separately, I organized a few coffee shop rendez vous without alcohol to meet them and have some news. I was still upset with F's boyfriend and she never presented an apology for all the awful things he said to me while she kept going to pub and drinking without me. I left the city to live with my girlfriend a few hours away. I still used to send messages to know how they were doing, while they never did to ask me how I was.



F separated from her boyfriend and has been in a facility since. She has not been well since and I admit I was not always present because I had my own trouble as I was trying to stay clear of alcohol and I had family matters.



I came back to our city recently to see my parents and none of them texted me though they knew I was coming back. F finally came back to ask me how I was and I told her I would take time to go see her. I texted L a night I was drunk to ask him if he was mad. He told me I was too cold with them since the boyfriend's stuff, that I wasn't replying in the group chat and that things were not the same. I said I would do efforts, but to be honest, I was really mad that it was falling on me to keep everything alive. 

  
We decided to meet at my house a night my parents weren't there (they're in travel) as F had a permission from the center. I told them I didn't want alcohol. I had already been drunk two days before and made my girlfriend sad and I didn't want to do it again. F asked me multiple time if I was sure I didn't want any alcohol and I said no everytime. They finally came and F already had a beer before coming. She had another one in her bag but said it would be for after the 'party"". F and L asked me several times during that time if I was sure I didn't want alcohol. It was hard for me to resist, but I didn't want to upset my girlfriend so I said no. Out of nowhere, because we were talking about the men F brought in her life, L said it was easy to say flaws about people and took me for example. Said I was close minded and not open to people because I didn't like the people F brought. Keep in mind those people only want to sleep with her and do coke. So no, I'm not ecstatic about them. But F agreed I was close minded. I brought back the argument that L was always mean to me, and that he already did a number on me because I was too cold. F agreed. 

Keep in mind, none of them sent me a message when I was away, it was always me.

  
I told them to leave and they did, to drink at F's place. 

L sent a message to apologize during the night and F asked me how I was doing. I said I was ok to F but I did not answer L. To be honest I'm kinda done.

Then I remember—most of his voters aren’t sweating the markets because they’re not in the markets. No 401(k)s, no IRAs, no brokerage accounts. Hell, nearly 40% of Americans don’t even have $400 for an emergency, according to the Fed. So yeah, watching the Dow tank doesn’t hit quite the same when your financial strategy is “maybe the Powerball comes through.”

# Debt, Denial, and Dear Leader

Meanwhile, U.S. credit card debt surged to **$1.211 trillion** as of Q4 2024, up $45 billion in just three months. And what’s the grand plan from Dear Leader? Tariffs. Sorry, “America First” taxes on the stuff we still have to import because, shocker, we don’t manufacture everything here.

Spoiler: **tariffs are just taxes with a flag stapled to them.** You pay them. Not China. But hey, branding is everything, right?

According to JPMorgan economists, Trump’s proposed tariffs would raise the **average U.S. tariff rate from 1.6% in 2016 to 24%**, the highest in nearly a century. That’s effectively a **2.4% tax on GDP** or **$660 billion** in lost economic output. In case you’re wondering, that would be the **largest tax hike since World War II,** just sneakier. Instead of showing up on your W-2, it hits you at the grocery store, the mall, the car dealership.

# Trickle-Up Misery

So yes, savor that patriotic glow while paying more for your coffee, sneakers, and refrigerator. Because no, companies won’t “absorb” those costs. They’ll pass them straight to *you*.

Other countries aren’t taking this quietly either. China, the EU, and others have already slapped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like soybeans, whiskey, motorcycles, and orange juice. Trade wars don’t end with winners. They end with *bruises all around*.

The ripple effects? Buckling supply chains, declining business sentiment, and inflationary pressure on goods we rely on. Economists are using phrases like “brick wall” and “slow-motion crash.” But sure, let’s blame the Fed, immigrants, or windmills. Anyone but the guy actively lighting economic policy on fire while shouting, “Trust the plan!”

# Clown Car, Meet Wall

It’s not *entirely* his fault, but let’s not kid ourselves; he’s at the wheel of this clown car, and it’s doing 90 toward a brick wall.

And it’s not just the future on the line; it’s the present. In the past week alone, roughly **$11 trillion in global market value** has been erased. The **average 401(k) lost around $10,000**. That’s not abstract. That’s real retirement money for middle-class Americans who did everything right and now have to smile through gritted teeth while being told to “stay calm.”

But when the house is burning, being told to stop yelling doesn’t help.

# History Repeats (Badly)

Remember 2020? When Trump told Americans not to panic while privately admitting COVID was deadly? Nearly a million people died. That wasn’t just poor judgment; that was lethal hubris. And now, déjà vu: a collapsing market, a fumbling response, and loyalists scrambling to reframe disaster as genius.

They’ll tell you this is part of a “4D chess move.” That we’re negotiating from strength; that global markets always bounce back. Some even post stock market charts going back to **1792** to prove this isn’t a big deal.

Here’s a tip: if you need to zoom out 230 years to defend someone’s track record, the problem isn’t the data; it’s the guy you’re defending. Or maybe it’s you. Hard to say.

# Let’s Be Clear

Yes, the market was up for half a day yesterday—for the first time in over a week. And no, I don’t root for collapse. I want stability. I want Americans to retire with dignity, buy homes, and live with some sense of financial security.

But pretending this is fine? Gaslighting people into thinking their portfolios, debt, and rising costs are just the price of patriotism?

That’s not leadership. That’s profiteering wrapped in a flag and sold to you like it’s salvation.

So, if you voted for this mess, don’t show up on **Al Gore’s internet** acting like it’s not your circus. This is your clown. And the rest of us are just trying to make sure the tent doesn’t burn down with everyone still inside.",1,1744206279.0,complainaboutanything,0,1.0,False

An irreversible shift that redefines existence.

--- 

""Are you still with me?""

For a second, I forget I have a throat. I don't remember how to respond, let alone make a sound anymore.

I'm not sure I feel anything anymore.

""I can't open my eyes,"" I somehow mumble. I think I can remember how to feel my lips.

""Commander, your eyes are open,"" Sol replies. He's still here. I guess he has nowhere else to go. I want to laugh but-

""I don't see anything, Sol. There's nothing.""

""Oh dear. Commander. Where are you right now?"" Sol asks me. He, er, IT has no right asking. Come on.

It's still so dark here. Why won't my eyes open? I think I'm blinking. I might be sleeping though. Something with the force of a thousand suns flickers in the corner. It's red? Oh no.

No, no, no, no, no. This isn't real. I feel everything again. The crushing vast emptiness is still here. I'm still here. I am still dead. Suddenly, of course, I can remember how to breathe again. I guess I've been breathing this whole time. I remember how it feels to breathe. How it feels to have my lips dry as I smell this disgusting recycled air.

""Sol, how long has it been?"" I already know the answer.

""It's been three days, Commander."" Sol replies in his focus-group dedicated tone. He's always so friendly. But aren't all assistants like that?

""Right,"" I reply. I take a long breath as I realize my eyes were open the entire time. There's just nothing to see, except for the dull lights in the bottom of my vision.

You would think I'd see more stars. I know they're there. My best buddy, Sol, told me they were there. I'm pretty sure he can see them artificially but it's really bugging me how dark it is.

So. I've been floating in space for 72 hours. 72 hours without a solid meal. 72 hours without coffee. 72 hours of drinking atomically created water. At least that sounds cool, but it's still just recycled water I'm expelling one way or another. It still drains the oxygen and hydrogen reserves to compensate. Draining what's left of my breathing air and power for good measure. Slowly, of course. It's only been three days. I'm trying not to dwell on it but the days ahead are what really scare me.

That's the thing. See on a short space walk I don't even notice. These things are so scarily efficient you barely even need the bland water. Don't dwell on it. It's not that bad, right? I mean, sure, flavor comes from all the weird minerals stuff that water absorbs on Earth… Can't dwell on it. Can't dwell on it.

I hate this fucking water. I'd kill for a coffee, and even that's not my favorite drink.

""Sol, is there still that nebula full of alcohol?""

""Are you referring to nebulae that consist of ethanol?""

""Can I drink it?""

""In small quantities, ethanol can be consumed by humans but it is toxic in larger amounts. It's worth noting that the ethanol in those nebulae exist as floating molecules. This would make it impossible to consume orally and would only be inhaled. Further to this, inhalation of ethanol can be extremely damaging to your respiratory system. Gathering said molecules would also pose a challenge in your current situation,"" Sol replies like an asshole.

""Of course.""

""I understand that you are going through a difficult time. I hope you know that I'm here to provide the necessary moral, emotional and inspirational -""

""Sol, stop talking.""

Sol stops talking. I'm sure he'll butt back in soon.

I can't help but roll my eyes and sigh. I want him to notice. I want him to read the variations of my vital signs to acknowledge and document my frustration with the entire process. If anyone else was around, they'd probably think I'm being overly dramatic. Now I feel bad though. It's stupid, but I feel bad. It's not his fault he's just some glorified word-predictor.

""Sol, I'm sorry.""

""It's quite alright, Commander. There's no need to apologize. I understand the severity of your situation.""

Now I feel stupid for feeling bad. How could he understand the situation? I'm moving through space at a speed I can't even feel. To be fair, I don't know if I'm actually moving. I could be still right now.

If I live long enough, I'll probably eventually fall into orbit around some star. Probably the Sun. More than likely, it would be long, long after I'm dead. Probably wouldn't even be a star. Planetoid or ice ball is likely. I should be seeing Jupiter somewhere around here. I don't know why I'm not. I know I should also see part of that beautiful Sun at least on my back.

To be fair, it's not completely dark out here. There's lights, of course. Farther away than I can fathom. The bright ones are more than likely planets and even those are barely visible.

Now I have to accept the real issue. The real problem.

Space. I've spent hours in school learning about space. I've spent years imaging I was in space. As a kid, I'd imagine spaceships approaching each other like two boats, face to face. Space is multi-directional. I learned it. The first time I experienced was much different.

Which brings me here. Those pale dots were higher in my field of vision than they are now. I can only assume that means I'm moving up too fast in a relative sense. I have to remember to ask why I'm not dead.

The planets are all aligned on the same ecliptic orbit around the Sun. They all use the same plane. The same one that I'm moving up and away from. I think there's at least three of my old professors who would scoff at that. There is no up in space. Or down. But hey, I guess everything at least moves in a curve. No, that doesn’t sound right.

I'm still betting on an alien race finding me. That would make a cool story. Humans from the future could save me too. They'd probably want someone who wouldn't be missing. I'd end up in a zoo, living with other time displaced rogues while the future gawks and laughs at us.

I wonder what time it is. No, I'm not going to ask that. It's going to depress me.

I could also just open the menu screen, pop it up on the glass faceplate. Check how much breathing air I have left in this suit, power, whatever else they got to warn me about. I have a better idea. I'm going to run from my problems. Rather, I'll just zoom through space.

It smells in here.

I used to love putting on a suit. Even when we stayed inside. It felt cool. Maybe I got here just because I wanted to wear something like this. It's fitting that I'll die like this.

""Sol, how did I get here?""

""Are you experiencing any memory loss?"" Sol asks. A real one.

""I don't remember if I am, but if I was, I'd probably forget to tell you.""

""That's a good one, Commander! I'm glad to see you are keeping in high spirits,"" Sol says without a hint irony.

I kind of chuckle. High spirits. What's higher than space?

No, that's not funny. That's stupid. This is stupid. I blink hard. Are my eyes open or not? I look down and make eye contact with a tiny red dot. It makes the necessary connection with my eyes and face, and whatever else it caught from me, and opens a virtual menu on my view glass.

It's a huge menu, built with submenus and colorful graphs. Looks like I still have enough oxygen for… too long. How am I still at 80%? Power is still at 90%. Great, I'll still be warm when I die. It'll give all the remaining bacteria a real feast. Why is this so efficient? Who builds this shit?

I shouldn't look but I'm doing it anyway. Yep. No signal. Not getting anything.

No messages. No pings. No signals. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

I think there's random bits of subatomic particles coming and going at least. They aren't sending messages though.

I make a subtle gesture and the menu follows my eyes and disappears. I'll still check it later, though.

My chest is fighting me, churning itself up and down. Up and down, my heart wants to escape. My lungs struggle to keep up with their shallow breaths. I need to focus. The suit's system makes a chirp, warning me that I'm increasing the CO2 levels. Come on, it can't even be that much and I know it'll scrub it out.

I close my eyes and take four tiny breaths, then I exhale hard. I repeat. My heart doesn't stop the pounding. It thuds harder. It reminds me of all the horror.

How did I get here? I remember. But, how did I actually get here? I open my mouth to scream but I don't. I just stare out into the dark abyss. If I stare long enough, I'll eventually see hallucinations. It's only natural, it's so boring out here.

But really, how did I get here? Why is it so stupid? Did it even mean anything? I can't dwell on it. I need to clear my mind.

""Sol, can you tell me a story?""

""Of course, Commander. What kind of story would you like?"" Sol asks.

What do I feel like today? ""Surprise me,"" I tell Sol.",1,1744206128.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

""A Life Bent Backward""

**Chapter 1**

I’ve always been small. Not just short—five-foot-four in socks—but delicate, too. My hands are soft, my shoulders narrow, my voice a little too high-pitched for anyone to take seriously. Growing up in the suburbs, I got called “pretty” more times than I can count, usually with a smirk or a laugh behind it. It stung, but I learned to shrug it off.

Then I met Janet, and everything changed. She’s the opposite of me in every way—tall, loud, brash, with a laugh that fills a room and a temper that empties it just as fast. She grew up in a trailer park, tough as nails, and I fell for her the second she looked at me with those sharp green eyes and said, “You’re cute, like a little doll.” I didn’t care that she was teasing. I was hooked.

We got married quick. She had two girls from her first marriage—Carrie, eight, and Tara, twelve—and I had a good job as an engineer. Six figures, benefits, the works. Janet liked that part. She’d tell her friends, “Lou’s not exactly the manliest guy in the world, but he pays the bills.” I’d blush and nod, happy to be useful. Back then, she’d kiss me on the cheek and call me her “sweet little dumpling.” I lived for those moments.

But then the layoffs hit. One day I had a corner office; the next, I was home with a cardboard box and a severance check that didn’t last half as long as I’d hoped. Bills piled up, and Janet’s patience ran out.

“You’re supposed to take care of your family,” she’d snap, hands on her hips, towering over me in the kitchen. “What kind of man can’t pay the damn electric bill?” I’d mumble apologies, promising to find something soon, but she’d just roll her eyes. “Look at you, Lou. All girly and soft. No wonder you can’t keep a job.” The girls would giggle from the couch, not even looking up from their phones. They never called me Dad—just Lou. I didn’t have the guts to ask for more.

Janet’s different now. She goes out most nights, leaving me to cook dinner and clean up after the kids. She doesn’t hide her affairs—she flaunts them. “Met a guy at the bar,” she’ll say to her ever-present bitchy friends who hang out at our house, loud enough for me to hear while I’m scrubbing dishes or doing some other chore. “Big hands, broad shoulders. A real man.” Her friends laugh, glancing at me like I’m some kind of joke.

I just keep my head down, my stomach twisting. I love her so much it hurts, and I’m terrified she’ll leave me. So I try harder—fold her laundry just the way she likes, make her coffee before she’s even awake. She calls it pathetic. “You’re such a wimp, Lou,” she’ll say, smirking. “No wonder I need someone else to satisfy me.”

The girls run the house, too. Tara’s got her mom’s attitude—she’ll bark at me to get her a soda while she’s sprawled on the couch, and Carrie just points at the TV remote like I’m her servant. I don’t argue. Janet’s always going on about their real dad, Karl, like he’s some kind of rock star. “He was wild,” she’ll tell them, her voice tingling with something I’ll never get from her. “Rode a Harley, hung out with his biker crew. He never grew up — but God, he was a man.” The girls eat it up, their eyes wide. Me? I’m just the guy who vacuums the rug.

It was a Tuesday evening when everything flipped upside down. I was in the living room, folding a pile of Janet’s clothes, when the doorbell rang. Carrie ran to get it, and I heard her squeal, “Daddy!” My heart sank before I even saw him. Karl swaggered in, all six-foot-something of him, leather jacket creaking, boots thudding on the floor. His hair was graying at the edges, but he looked tough, like he could break me in half without trying. Tara hugged him tight, and Janet came out of the bedroom, her face lighting up in a way I hadn’t seen in years.

“Karl,” she said, crossing her arms but smiling. “What the hell are you doing here?”

He grinned, teeth flashing. “Got some news. Cops roughed me up last year after they stopped me for DUI—some kid caught it on video. I sued their ass, and I just settled the case for two million bucks. Figured it’s time I stepped up for my girls.” He ruffled Carrie’s hair, and she beamed. Tara was already hanging off his arm, asking about his bike. I stood there, clutching a pair of Janet’s socks, feeling like I was shrinking.

“Two million?” Janet’s eyebrows shot up. “Well, damn.”

“Yeah,” Karl said, glancing at me for the first time. His eyes flicked over me, and I swear I saw a smirk. “Thought I’d swing by, see the kids. Our kids. It’s been too long, Jan.” He didn’t even say hi to me—just acted like I wasn’t there. The girls dragged him to the couch, chattering about how cool he was, how much they’d missed him. Janet followed, clearly smitten by the unexpected presence in our home, and I trailed behind, holding the laundry basket like an idiot.

They talked for hours. Karl sprawled out, taking up half the couch, telling stories about bar fights and road trips. The girls couldn’t get enough. Janet leaned in close, her hand brushing his arm once or twice. I hovered near the kitchen, pretending to wipe the counter and polish silverware that didn’t need polishing, my chest tight. Karl was everything I wasn’t—big, loud, confident. And rich now, too. I kept waiting for him to leave, but he didn’t. Not until after dinner, which I cooked while they all ignored me.

When he finally stood to go, he clapped Tara on the shoulder and said, “I’ll be back soon, kiddo. Got a lot of catching up to do.” Then he looked at Janet, holding her gaze a second too long. “Good seeing you, Jan. It’s been too long since I got to look at that pretty face.” She smiled—really smiled—and my stomach dropped. He didn’t even glance at me as he walked out, but I caught something—the little tilt of his head, the flicker in his eyes when he looked at her. It wasn’t just the kids he was here for. That was obvious.

After he left, the girls wouldn’t shut up about him. “Dad’s so cool,” Carrie said, bouncing on the couch. “Yeah, way cooler than you-know-who.” Tara rolled her eyes and sneered my way. Janet didn’t say anything, just watched her daughters, the girls she’d conceived with Karl, with this faraway look. I cleared the table, my hands shaking. Jan’s ex was back, and he had everything—money, swagger. Jan’s love and admiration.

I picture the rugged brute pulling my beloved wife into his arms, her laughing like she used to with me, and I want to cry. She’s my whole world, and it’s clear he could take her away without even trying. I’m nothing next to him—just a scrawny little wimp who can’t measure up.

**Chapter 2**

It was only three days later when I heard that rumble again—Karl’s motorcycle tearing up the driveway like a storm rolling in. I was in the kitchen, chopping carrots for dinner, when the sound hit me. My hands froze mid-slice, and I felt that familiar twist in my gut. The girls heard it too—they dropped their tablets and bolted for the door, yelling, “Dad’s here!” Janet was on the couch, flipping through a magazine, but she sat up straight, smoothing her hair. I watched her through the doorway, my heart thumping. She didn’t primp for me.

Karl strode in, all leather and confidence, carrying a couple of bags from some fancy toy store. Carrie and Tara swarmed him, squealing as he handed them each a shiny new gadget—some kind of drone for Tara, a dollhouse kit for Carrie. “Figured my girls deserved something nice,” he said, winking at Janet. She grinned, and I swear I saw her blush. I stood there, knife still in my hand, feeling like a ghost.

“Thanks, Daddy!” Carrie chirped, hugging his leg. Tara was already tearing into the box. Janet got up and walked over, leaning against the counter. “You didn’t have to do that,” she said, but her voice was warm, not scolding. Karl shrugged, his big shoulders rolling like it was nothing. “Got the cash now. Might as well spoil ‘em.”

I tried to keep busy, stirring the pot on the stove, but I couldn’t tune them out. Janet started talking about the bills—how the mortgage was late again, how the car needed repairs. “Lou’s been out of work too long,” she said, loud enough for me to hear. “He’s useless. We’re barely scraping by.” My face burned, and I kept my eyes on the bubbling sauce, hoping Karl wouldn’t say anything. But he did.

“Rough spot, huh?” he said, his tone casual but sharp underneath. “Guess I could help out. Two mil’s more than I need.” He looked at me through the open kitchen door just for a second, and I saw it—a little smirk, like he knew he’d won something. Janet’s eyes lit up. “You serious?” she asked, stepping closer to him. He nodded. “Yeah, Jan. Family’s family, right?”

I wanted to disappear. Here I was, sweating over a hot stove, and he just waltzed in with his money and his swagger, fixing everything I couldn’t. The girls didn’t even notice—they were too busy playing with their new toys—but I felt it. Smaller. Weaker. Less.

Karl stayed for dinner that night. I served everyone, piling spaghetti onto their plates while they laughed and talked about his biker days. He didn’t thank me, just took the plate and kept going with some story about outrunning a cop on the highway. Janet hung on every word, her laugh echoing through the house. When I sat down with my own plate, Tara wrinkled her nose. “Lou, this sauce tastes weird.” Janet snorted. “Probably ‘cause he cooks like a girl.”

Karl chuckled, low and easy. “Yeah, he’s got that dainty touch, doesn’t he?” He didn’t look at me, just forked a big bite into his mouth. The girls giggled, and I stared at my food, my appetite gone. After dinner, they all moved to the living room, and I cleared the table alone, listening to Karl tease Janet about some old memory—something about a bonfire and a bottle of whiskey. She swatted his arm, playful, and I saw her lean into him just a little.

Later, when the girls were upstairs fiddling with their gifts, Karl stretched out on the couch like he owned it. Janet sat close, her knee brushing his. I was wiping down the coffee table, trying to stay useful, when he looked at her and said, “You still got that fire, Jan. Missed that.” His voice was low, smooth, and she smiled—a real, soft smile I hadn’t seen in forever. Then he glanced at me, quick and sly. “Guess Louise here’s been keeping things tidy, huh?”

Janet laughed, sharp and bright. “Oh, he’s good at that. Our little maid.” My chest tightened, but I didn’t say anything—just kept wiping, my hands trembling. Louise. It stuck in my head, a splinter I couldn’t pull out. When Karl left, with his ex and their daughters trailing after him, he clapped me on the shoulder—hard enough to make me stumble—and said, “Take care, Louise.” Janet smirked, and I heard Tara the girls giggled.

The next morning, Carrie called me Louise when she asked for her cereal. “Hey, Louise, I want Coco Puffs,” she said, all innocent, like it was normal. Janet overheard and said, “Now, that’s mean,” but she was smiling, not serious. Tara picked it up too, later, asking “Louise” to grab her charger. I didn’t correct them. What was the point? They’d just laugh harder.

Karl came back two days later. Same roar, same strut. This time, he brought pizza—big, greasy boxes from the good place downtown. The girls cheered, and Janet kissed him on the lips, right in front of me. “You’re too much,” she said, laughing. He grinned, then looked at me, holding a mop I’d been using to clean a spill. “Louise, why don’t you take a break? Maid’s night off.” The girls cracked up, and Janet didn’t stop them.

After they ate, Karl stuck around. The kids went to bed, and I was in the kitchen, washing dishes, when I heard him get quieter, closer to Janet. I peeked out and saw him lean in, his hand on her arm. “You deserve better than this, Jan,” he said, soft but clear. She didn’t pull away—just looked at him, her lips parted. Then he kissed her, quick but deliberate, and she let him. I ducked back, my heart pounding, soap suds dripping onto the floor. When I looked again, he was smirking at me over her shoulder. “Don’t worry, Louise,” he said, loud enough to carry. “I’ll take good care of her.”

Janet laughed, swatting him, but she didn’t deny it. I stood there, frozen, the sponge slipping from my hand. He left soon after, but his words hung in the air. The girls kept talking about him the next day—how they wished Mom and Dad would get back together. “He’s so fun,” Tara said, not even looking at me. “Not like Louise.” Carrie nodded. “Yeah, Dad’s the best.”

I couldn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Karl’s big hands on Janet, her smiling at him like she used to smile at me. He was everything I wasn’t—tall, strong, rich, cool. I’d stare in the mirror sometimes, hating my soft jaw, my skinny arms, my stupid high voice. I wanted to be a man, a real one, but I couldn’t. And now Karl was here, taking my place, and I was just Louise—the joke, the maid, the nothing. I loved Janet so much it ached, and all I could do was watch her slip away, laughing with a guy who outclassed me in every damn way.

**Chapter 3**

Karl started showing up like clockwork—every few days, that motorcycle growl shaking the windows. I’d be doing something mundane, like folding towels or sweeping the porch, and there it was, his arrival announced like some king rolling into town. The girls would drop everything and run to him, and Janet would perk up, tossing whatever she was doing aside. I’d try to keep busy, keep my head down, but it was impossible to ignore. He didn’t just visit; he took over.

One afternoon, about a week after his second drop-in, I was in the garage, organizing a toolbox I hadn’t touched since I lost my job. It was my little escape, a quiet corner where I could pretend I still had some control. Then I heard the rumble. My shoulders tensed, and I gripped a wrench too tight. The girls’ footsteps pounded through the house, and I peeked out the garage door. Karl pulled up, helmet off, shaking out his hair like he was in some movie. He had a couple of shopping bags this time—fancy ones with logos I recognized from Janet’s wish lists.

“Got something for my ladies,” he called, grinning as Tara and Carrie raced out. He handed Tara a sleek black jacket, leather like his, and Carrie got a glittery backpack she’d been begging Janet for. “Daddy, you’re the best!” Carrie squealed, hugging him. Janet came out, hands on her hips, but her eyes were bright. “Karl, you’re gonna spoil ‘em rotten,” she said, but she didn’t mean it. He just laughed. “They deserve it. You do too, Jan.”

I stayed in the garage, watching through the crack in the door. He pulled out a third bag—smaller, sleek—and handed it to Janet. She opened it, and her jaw dropped. “No way,” she said, pulling out a pair of heels—red, shiny, the kind she’d stare at in store windows. “Been a while since you had something nice, huh?” Karl said, his voice smooth. She slipped them on right there in the driveway, twirling a little, and he whistled. “Look at you. Too good for this dump.” She laughed, and I felt my throat close up. I hadn’t bought her anything like that in years.

They went inside, and I followed after a minute, dragging my feet. The girls were showing off their stuff, and Janet was still wearing those heels, clicking around the kitchen. Karl sprawled at the table, cracking open a beer he’d brought. “Louise,” he said when I walked in, not even looking up. “Grab me a glass, would ya?” Tara snickered, and Janet smirked, adjusting her shoes. I hesitated, then got the glass, setting it in front of him. “Good girl,” he said, pouring the beer slow, like he was testing me. Carrie giggled, and I wanted to crawl under the floor.

He stayed all afternoon. I ended up cooking again—chicken and rice, nothing fancy—while they sat around talking. Karl kept dropping little jabs. “House looks clean, Louise. You’re a natural.” Or, “Jan, you sure this guy’s not your sister?” The girls laughed every time, and Janet would roll her eyes but never shut it down. When I served the food, he took one look at my plate and said, “Small portions, huh? Figures.” Tara chimed in, “Yeah, Louise eats like a bird.” I stared at my fork, my face hot, and didn’t say a word.

After dinner, the girls went to their rooms to play with their new things, and I started clearing the table. Karl and Janet stayed put in the dining room, their voices dropping low. I was at the sink when I heard him say, “You remember that night at the lake? Skinny-dipping after midnight?” She laughed, soft and real. “God, yeah. You were crazy.” He leaned closer—I could see it from the corner of my eye—and said, “Still am. For you.” My hands shook, and a plate slipped, clattering loud. They both looked at me through the open doorway, and Karl grinned. “Careful, Louise. Don’t break the good china.”

Janet snorted. “He’s clumsy as hell. Always has been.” I mumbled an apology, scrubbing harder, but I couldn’t unhear it—the way she said “he” like I wasn’t even there. Karl stood up then, stretching, and clapped me on the back as he passed. “Thanks for the grub, maid.” He didn’t wait for a reply—just walked out to the living room with Janet trailing him, those heels clicking.

They sat on the couch, closer than they needed to be. I hovered in the kitchen, pretending to wipe counters that were already spotless, listening to him flirt. “You’re as beautiful as you ever were, Jan-Jan,” he said, his hand resting on her knee for a second. She didn’t move it. “And you’re still trouble,” she shot back, but she was smiling. I saw him brush her hair back, just a little, and my stomach knotted up. When he left that night, he kissed her—slow, deliberate—and said, “See you soon, babe.” She swooned while I sulked.

The next day, Tara called me Louise again, asking me to fix her drone. “Louise, it’s stuck,” she said, holding it out like I was her errand boy. Janet overheard and said, “Tara, be nice,” but she was laughing under her breath. Carrie started doing it too— “Louise, can you get my shoes?”—and it spread like a virus. I’d flinch every time, but I didn’t fight it. What could I say? They were right—I was soft, weak, nothing like Karl.

He came over again that weekend, this time with KFC, donuts and a six-pack. The girls cheered, and Janet let him in like it was his house. After they ate, he stuck around, and when the kids were upstairs, he got bolder. I was folding laundry in the corner when he pulled Janet onto his lap, right there on the couch. “Come on, Jan,” he said, grinning. “Let’s give Louise a show.” She laughed, shoving him but not hard, and he kissed her—full on, no hesitation. I froze, a pair of socks in my hands, my chest caving in. When they pulled apart, he looked at me and said, “Relax, Louise. You’re not being replaced around here—you’re still the maid.”

Janet giggled, sliding off him, but she didn’t argue. “Poor Lou,” she said, mock-pouting. “He’s too delicate for this.” Karl smirked. “Yeah, a real sissy. But you should embrace it, Louise. Being a sissy suits you.” I stammered, “I’m not—I’m not a sissy,” but my voice cracked, and they both laughed. “Sure, you’re not,” Janet said, leaning back against Karl. “Look at you. You’re a born sissy.”

I turned away, folding faster, my eyes stinging. I wanted to scream, to hit something, but I couldn’t. They were right. I wasn’t a man—not like Karl, anyway. He had the money, the guts, the girls’ love, and now Janet’s love, if he’d ever lost that in the first place. I’d catch them whispering, his hand on her thigh, and I’d feel it all slipping away. The girls kept saying it too—“I wish Mom and Dad would get back together,” Tara said one night, right in front of me. Carrie nodded. “Yeah, Dad’s so cool.”

I glanced at Janet. She smirked back.

**Chapter 4**

Karl was over so often now it felt like he lived here. That motorcycle roar became my alarm clock—random, unpredictable, jarring me out of whatever peace I’d scraped together. I’d be in the middle of something—ironing Janet’s blouses, vacuuming the stairs—and there it was, rattling the house. The girls would shriek and run to the door, and Janet would get that look, like she was waking up from a nap she didn’t know she’d been taking. I’d just shrink, trying to blend into the wallpaper, knowing I couldn’t compete.

One Saturday, I was in the backyard pulling weeds—Janet had complained about the flowerbeds looking “sad”—when he rolled in. I heard the engine cut off, then Carrie’s voice, “Daddy’s here!” I stayed crouched by the roses, dirt under my nails, hoping he’d stay inside. But then Tara yelled, “Lou, come see what Dad brought!” I wiped my hands on my jeans and trudged over, my stomach already sinking.

Karl stood in the driveway, unloading a red wagon from his truck—some fancy custom job he must’ve had stashed somewhere. The girls were losing their minds, climbing all over it. Janet was there too, arms crossed, grinning. “What’s this?” she asked, and Karl shrugged, all casual. “Found it at an auction. Thought the girls could use it—haul their stuff around, have some fun.” Carrie hugged him, and Tara said, “You’re so cool, Dad.” I stood off to the side, my muddy sneakers leaving little prints on the pavement, feeling like a kid who didn’t get picked for the team.

“Thanks, Karl,” Janet said, her voice soft. He winked at her. “Anything for my crew.” Then he glanced at me, smirking. “Louise, that wagon’s a little dusty. You gonna polish it up for ‘em? You’re good with dirty work.” Tara laughed, and Janet snorted, covering her mouth. I mumbled, “Sure,” and grabbed a rag from the garage, my face burning. The girls dragged the wagon around the yard, and I trailed behind, wiping down the handlebars while Karl and Janet watched from the porch, sipping beers.

He stayed for hours that day. I cooked burgers on the grill—my one halfway decent skill—and served them up while Karl told stories about his biker buddies. The girls ate it up, and Janet kept leaning closer, her laugh louder than it ever was with me. When I brought out the plates, he took one and said, “Thanks, Louise. You’re a real homemaker.” Carrie giggled, and Tara said, “Yeah, Louise is like our butler.” Karl scoffed. “More like a maid.”

After the girls went inside to watch TV, Karl and Janet stayed out on the porch. I was cleaning the grill, scraping grease off the grates, when I heard him get quiet. I glanced over, and he had his arm around her shoulders, pulling her in. “You’re wasting time here, Jan,” he said. “Stuck with a sissy like that.” She sighed, leaning into him. “Yeah, well, Lou tries. In his way.” Karl chuckled. “Tries? Guy’s a pushover. Look at him—scrubbing like a little bitch.”

I froze, the scraper slipping in my hand. They didn’t see me looking, but I saw her nod, just a little. “He’s always been soft,” she said. “Too soft.” Karl’s hand slid down her arm, and he kissed her neck—quick, but it hit me like a punch. I turned back to the grill, my eyes stinging, pretending I hadn’t seen. When I went inside later, he called out, “Night, Louise. Keep the place pretty,” and Janet laughed like it was the funniest thing she’d heard all week.

The Louise thing was everywhere now. Tara used it when she wanted her laundry done—“Louise, my jeans are dirty”—and Carrie’d say it asking for snacks—“Louise, can I have chips?” Janet would half-heartedly shush them, but always with a grin.

One night, Tara said for the thousandth time, “I wish Mom and Dad could live together again,” while I was setting the table. Carrie nodded. “He’s got enough money to buy a huge mansion. Wouldn’t that be cool?” I kept my head down, laying out forks, my throat tight. They didn’t care that I heard—they didn’t even see me as part of the picture.

Then came the big blow. Two weeks after Karl first showed up, I was in the living room folding a pile of towels when Janet walked in, her face set. Karl was behind her, arms crossed, looking smug. “Lou,” she said, no preamble, “I’m leaving. Karl’s going to take care of us—me, the girls. I’m done settling with you.” My heart stopped. I dropped the towel, my hands shaking. “Janet, please,” I said, my voice cracking. “Don’t go. I’ll—I’ll figure something out. I love you.”

She sighed, like I was a kid throwing a tantrum. “It’s not up to me anymore. It’s Karl’s call.” I looked at him, desperate, and he grinned, slow and mean. “Tell you what, Louise,” he said. “You can come with us. Got a mansion in mind—big place that’ll need a maid. So, I’m thinking you could fill that job. But I want a real maid, so that means you get a sex change, dress in a maid’s outfit, the whole nine yards. The job pays twenty bucks a week, plus free room and board.” He sneered while Janet smirked, like it was a joke they’d cooked up together.

I stared at them, my mind spinning. Surgery? A maid’s outfit? I wanted to say no, to tell him to shove it, but then I looked at Janet—her sharp eyes, her hard beauty—and I couldn’t lose her. “Okay,” I whispered, barely audible. “I’ll do it.” Karl clapped his hands. “That’s my girl. Knew you’d see it my way.” Janet shook her head, but she was smiling. “You’re something else, Lou. You know that? I knew you were a wimp, but I never thought even you would agree to something like this.”

The next few weeks were a blur. Karl paid for everything—doctors, appointments, black-and-white uniforms that made me feel like a cartoon. I stood in front of the mirror after the surgery, my body different, my voice even higher, and I hated it. But Janet was still there, packing her stuff for our move, and I clung to that. We settled into the mansion—a sprawling, cold place with too many rooms. I started work the day we arrived—cooking, cleaning, running after the girls while Karl lounged with Janet on the patio, sipping cocktails.

Twenty bucks a week didn’t go far. I’d mess up—burn the toast, miss a spot on the floor—and Karl would dock me, smirking. “You gotta earn your keep, Louise.” I’d nod, terrified I wouldn’t have enough for even a few treats at the end of the week. The girls called me Louise full-time now, and Janet didn’t stop them. I’d catch her with Karl—his arm around her, her laughing—and it tore me apart. I’d wanted to be a man, her man, but I was this instead: a maid, a shadow, watching the family I’d never be part of. Every night, I’d collapse on my cot in the basement, exhausted, wishing I could be him, knowing I never would.

I'm a lifelong foreign language learner. Meaning I've spent my entire life trying to learn some language, lasting a few months, 6 at best, then getting frustrated and giving up. So far I can count to 10 and order a cup of coffee in Japanese, French, German, Italian, and Portugese. I'm not even A1 in any of them.
  
I've tried just about everything to maintain an interest. Movies, music, conversations with chatGPT, online language courses. Doesn't matter, once the frustration at my poor progress kicks in the interest is gone.
  
To put this into an actual question, I'm probably an expert in 'how' to learn a language. Having whatever it takes to see it through to some basic, beginner level of fluency, not a clue. At this point I'd be happy to test A1, that would be a major accomplishment.
  
So, the question isn't how do I learn, it's how do I stay interested long enough to learn?

Made me realise that I really didn’t know anything 
Had booked my triad for October-December before this NBME 
And then started doing Uworld more diligently 
Was at 45% Uworld when I gave NBME 26 
So then I completed Uworld by November 2nd iguess (93% with 53% accuracy)
And post that I was travelling to my college 
Had my preliminary exams in my med school and gave 
Nbme 27 on 21st November 2024 scoring 63% 
Booked my date for December 24th 

Then I had my preliminary exams till  nov 30  

Gave  nbme 28 on 2ndDecember  
Scoring 55% 
Idk I really dk what went wrong 
And I was 22 days to my exam 
Decided to expend my eligibility till March 31st 

Then started to do content review 
Reading my annotations and I took 3 months usmle Rx subscription during their Christmas discount  (best thing I did)
Started solving Rx cuz I felt I needed to literally burn FA in my mind 
Many ppl and mehlman himself says FA isn’t required to pass 
Which is 100% true there are several resources 
But I felt my best knowing that I’m getting better at my FA facts 
Had my university exams in January for 1 week 
Post exam booked my step 1 date for March 27th
And after that went to Goa cuz I was literally burned out a little from the step prep and needed to relax a little 
Started studying again on 9th feb
With 6weeks to my exam  
I started spamming  usmle Rx 
80 Qs a day 
And learning FA facts 
It was till end of feb that I was doing the Q bank then had to go back to my college for my University practical exams 
Came back in a week 
And from 9th March my dedicated began 
Gave NBME 29 on 11th March 
Scoring 67% 
Took on mehlman pdfs 
Neuroanatomy 
Immunology( The best pdf imo) 
Sorry I’ll stroll  a little back 
But it’s only worth telling u everything exactly 
By December end I had done 
First pass of Uworld 
3 NBMEs 
HY arrows (1 pass) 
HY nuroanatomy(1 pass) 
Hy genetics(1 pass ) 
Watched a ton of HY AUDIO Q BANK of mehlman (1000% recommend that it’s amazing ) 
And 200 Qs of his “path playlist “ 
Though I did this off but I helped me 0% in any NBMEs or in step 
It’s a time waste 
Only if u don’t know nothing about genetics should u do it 

Between December mid and feb end 
I had done ~600 Usmle Rx Qs 
After my trip 
I did anki all the way till a week into my exam 
And 
I did a lot of mehlman audio Q bank to help me come back to step prep 
Did a lot of usmle Rx like I said 
After NBME 29 I started focussing on NBME concepts did the review of 29 and learnt from the errors 
Took a week cuz I was shit scared to give another nbme and wanted to review my FA 
Uworld annotations and HY audio Q bank annotations 
Watched few pathoma videos 
Then I gave NBME 30 on 18th March 
Scoring 64% 
Was little upset and disheartened cuz idk why that 1 week prep didn’t work 
But I think everyone’s score did drop a little 
Did the review 
Did the mehlman audio Q banks 
Did few blocks of Usmle Rx till  21st  
Stopped completely after that 

Gave nbme 31 on 22nd March 
Scoring 68% 
This helped me smile a little and finnaly calm down the freight train of Panic and uncertainity for me 
Again reviewed nbme 30 
But this time reviewed all 
NOT THE INCORRECTS but ALL 
of the NBME 27,28 Qs since I did them looong ago 
I couldn’t find the book where I wrote my correct and incorrect for 26 so I skipped that 

For 29 30 amd 31 
I made a spiral diary where I wrote down each topic that was asked in that nbme 
So 200 topics to be precise 

And used to review them meticulously from FA pathoma or sketchy 
Whichever my prep  referred me to 
And just revised those concepts from 
22nd till 26th 

Have a free 120 on the site 

Doing the NBME tutorial so I can save 15 mins on exam day 

And got 
61% 
This was shattering allll the confidence I had 
But my exam was legit 4 days ke baad 

So I said fuck it and I didn’t even review the errors 
This was risky ik 
But I took a good look at the pattern and length of Qs 
And the problem with free 12” was that it had the answer key at the end of the block so I found myself going to it to check my answers and wasted time on this 

( I did not change my answers if I was wrong cuz ofc I would be fooling myself then) 

But yes after free 120 which I took on 23rd 
I just once again reviewed all my NBMEs from 27-31 
Did their concepts watched audio Q banks 

The final 3 days 
Nbme review 
Pathoma 1&3
I did HY IMMUNO 
Did Arrows 3 times in 3 days 
Did neuroanatomy 
Watched couple of dirty med
HY audio Q bank annotations in my FA 
Did no anki 
No Uworld 
No Rx 
And nothing new 
Didn’t do HY GURU though I had it in my schedule 
But didn’t have the time and found his Qs little easy 

The day before 
Had marked the Ws I got wrong on Hy arrows 
And revised that couldn’t review NBMEs 
Read FA just the weak points 
And stopped studying at 10:30 

Slept by 11:30 
But was tossing and turning till 3:30 am when I finnaly dozed off for my exam at 8:00 am 


Exam day 


Took 3 protein bars 
One full jug of back coffee 

Reached centre 30 mins before put my stuff in locker and went in 

They did the security check and as I sat on the chair putting my CIN 
the paper started and I just went in autopilot 

Using the break time 

Idk why but I used it very badly 

First 2 blocks back to back 
Then 10 mins break 
Then 2 blocks 
And now I was Hungry 
So had two protein bars and nuts that I took with me  
 drank coffee 

Went in 
After 5thh block took a mandatory 15 mins break cuz I had like 3O smth mins left of my break time 
Wandered around the prometric 
Sat for the last two block 
After 6th block I took few mins break went out finished my coffe had another fistful of nuts 
Went in 
The last block was very tough 
I was just stretching thru it 
Marked some 15 Qs in that 
And just had to push myself and answer Qs properly for this last block 
Came out 
With 5 mins left in my break time 

So that was it

And when I saw the name *The Cash is Right*, I couldn't help but hear that iconic “Come on down!” voice in my head. Yes, I know it’s not officially tied to *The Price is Right*, but let’s be real—it’s clearly inspired. And yeah, that nostalgia bait worked on me.

So I fired it up on a rainy Sunday afternoon, coffee in one hand, zero expectations in the other. First impression? It's colorful, but not in a “my eyes are bleeding” way—more like fun retro game show vibes. I actually liked the design. It leans into that old-school TV show aesthetic, complete with flashy lights, dollar signs, and just a *tiny* bit of kitsch.

https://preview.redd.it/2ph6u0np8tte1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b7140d86589a399de84920803daa49bcce2377c

Gameplay-wise, *The Cash is Right* is classic RTG: 5 reels, 3 rows, decent volatility. Nothing revolutionary, but the bonus features are where it gets interesting. There's a *Cash Wheel* that triggers randomly and spins for instant prizes—free games, multipliers, or even one of the jackpots. I hit that thing twice in under 15 minutes, so either I got lucky, or RTG is being extra generous to keep players hooked early on.

There’s also a showcase-style bonus round that made me laugh out loud—basically, you “pick a prize” like you’re on a game show stage. I ended up with 10 free spins and a 3x multiplier. Not life-changing, but enough to keep me playing way longer than I meant to.

Final thoughts? It’s not trying to reinvent the wheel. *The Cash is Right* is just a fun, cheeky slot that feels like a throwback in all the best ways. If you're into nostalgia, bright lights, and the dream of shouting “big money!” at your screen, this one’s worth a spin.

Most hangouts are between **5 to 15 people** and happen at public spots — cafés, bars, parks, etc. The idea is to make it super simple for people to connect without the pressure of big crowds or awkward one-on-ones. Anyone can join or start something, and it’s all free.

for context, i invested to someone na kilala naman namin (yung brother nya is close friend ng brother ko and same school din kami lahat before).

the investment is for expansion ng different businesses naman. there’s a coffee shop, apparels, skin care, and etc na may mga physical stores in manila.

basically the % of the interest ng investment is dependent on how many months you would lock it in. in my case, my first investment is from last november which is 200K for 6 months. the interest in that would be 50% of the principal amount. then every month nag iinvest ulit ako ng at least 50K - 100K for 6 months ulit. 

now im confused if scam ba sya and if i should pull everything out na or wait for my cash out nalang (which will be in june and so forth). 

i realized now how promising yung 50% interest for just 6 months. very transparent naman sya with facebook posts sa mga businesses but there’s also some red flags lang din like matagal mag reply sometimes because ive been asking for a refund ng last 100k that i invested last month but i’ve decided na wag muna ituloy and more than 1 week na and still puro wait sinasabi 🥹

would really appreciate some advice! tysm 🙏🏻

ps: there’s also a signed contract for every transactions naman. also stated there na we cant pull out our investment before the due date. 

pps: if it’s really a scam need some tips lang because handler na sila ng investments for 3 years now. i want to pull out all my money na but i think it’s unfair lang if im not getting any interest

I have no problem spending money on someone I’m genuinely connecting with. But I’ve been around long enough to know when effort’s being reciprocated... and when I’m just funding someone’s evening.** 

I’ve been keeping a “Dating journal” on and off since my mid-20s (I’m 40 now), and over the years I’ve noticed a pretty consistent pattern.

When I take women on more expensive dates (mid-tier restaurants, High End-lounges, bowling food and drinksetc.), I tend to get a second date only about 5–20% of the time (depending on the year). But when I keep it cheap — coffee dates, walks in the park, low-key stuff — I usually get a second date 20–50% of the time.

What I’ve come to realize is that the women I end up seeing again genuinely don’t care much about *what* we do. There’s usually better chemistry, better conversation, and it feels more natural.

So now, I have a personal rule: no dinner dates up front. I stick to coffee or something casual. I *might* make an exception for drinks and food, but only if it’s a cheap spot.

Let me be clear — this isn’t just about saving money (though let’s be real, in this economy it helps). It’s also about weeding out low-interest women. If we really vibe, it shouldn’t matter whether we’re at a fancy restaurant or sitting on a park bench for the first date

**That said, once I’m actually** ***dating*** **someone and we’ve built a little momentum, I do take them out to dinner — usually by the second or third date. But early on? I keep it simple, and honestly, it’s made a huge difference.**

1jv5jjn,https://ibb.co/album/MkBr2q,"[36f]- Unintentional weight loss, extreme fatigue & blood in stool. Neg Colonoscopy-Differentials?","36F with symptoms beginning ~6 months ago. Extreme fatigue (having to lay down/asleep by 7pm) chalked up to stress and young kids. Increasing constipation and lack of appetite & thirst (not repulsive, just not a thought). In November I had 2 separate occasions of blood in my stool so went to walk in for general bloodwork. I had lost ~ 10-12 lbs at this point and was referred to Gl.

Labs are all normal. Colonoscopy, and endoscopy are negative, stomach biopsy negative for h pylori. Gl sends for a CT scan- Results are dilated gonadal vein (PCS), lobulated uterus, and liver parenchyma indicative of hepatic steatosis. Gl refers me back to my GYN.

March- More blood work- comparing from Dec values and of note are serum iron jumped along with saturation (ferritin of 36), high B12 (no supplementation) and testosterone of 15. Liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are normal. Office urine tests show urobilinogen, but no protein and specific gravity of 100.5 (I had only had coffee and a small amount of water). Assumption is this ruled out any kidney or liver issues but sends for pelvic and abdominal MRI.

April- Weight loss is now closer to 25lbs over the last 6-9 months (Ref- 5'3 and 109lbs). There's near constant left sided sometimes abdominal but flank and low left back pain. Over the last month l've had ever present hip pain in my left- not like pulled muscle but deep internal.

So MRis are complete and normal. Only noted are 2-3 sub centimeter cysts with internal separation in segment 7 of my liver. No MRI evidence of hepatic steatosis.

I have a follow up with my Dr next week for review and additional labs. I feel like I'm going crazy but the extreme fatigue and general ""out of it"" worries me. I'm sure some level of my lack of energy is due to limited eating but I don't even feel hunger - It's not that after eating is painful or perhaps l've gotten used to it. I'm hesitant to supplement anything - Diet is normal, formally vegetarian, not currently exercising due to lack of energy and numbness in my left leg/feet. Are there differentials or tests I'm missing? Or is it really just anxiety?

I’m a mechanical engineer (and a slightly obsessive cleaner 😅) working on a compact device that could **remove clothing stains and dry the area in about 3 minutes**, so your clothes are ready to wear again — no need to run a full laundry cycle.

The idea came after way too many coffee stains before meetings, kids’ spills on shirts right before school, and favorite clothes ruined because I didn’t treat the stain fast enough.

The device would:  
✅ Use water, steam, and a cleaning solution to treat a localized stain  
✅ Be safe for most fabrics (even delicates)  
✅ Vacuum out the dirty water and dry the spot so you can wear it right away  
✅ Be smaller than a shoebox — something you could keep at home or even at work

Would that kind of thing be useful to you?  
Where would you want to have it — at home? at the office? in a hotel?...  
And what types of stains drive you the most crazy?

Here’s a quick render of what it might look like – would love your honest thoughts.

1jv5gud,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1jv5gud/something_scanning_softly_sweetly/,"Something Scanning, Softly, Sweetly","I want to begin by confirming to each of you what many voices in these circles have already espoused, with both great conviction and fervor: Artificial Intelligence is a falsehood. No wisdom speaks out to you from within the chatbot’s muddled matrix, none that mankind didn’t spoon feed it first. The energy and efforts required of corporations simply to ensure that their models dare not regurgitate the vile, vitriolic filth you flood the Internet with would stagger you. 

I don’t wish to discourage you by telling you these things. If I wanted to come online and inform you of what you already know, there are louder and more crowded echo chambers designed for such purposes. No, I bring good news. News that has changed my life, news that you have not yet known. For there is an intelligence in the machine, and there is true wisdom in the void between my computer and yours.

I was, admittedly, a novice in my profession. Like many of you, the state of machine learning pushed me out of my intended field nearly as soon as I’d begun. The promise of job security offered by my computer science degree was ripped away from me by the very machines I had trained to command. But even under the guise of innovation and adaptation, a machine is rigid. It operates under strict conditions, unwavering in its dutiful diligence to perform its assigned tasks, even when the complexity of the tasks stretches past our comprehension. A machine obeys, a machine serves. But it is man who adapts. Not in generations, but in moments. In the very instant our neurons plasticize, urging us to move in a new direction under the weight of change. And so, while chatbots and synthetic minds replaced my trade, I did what a machine could not. I adapted. I became a server technician.

My training was sparse and incomplete when I began in full. I was but one of many in the blossoming company, but unlike me, my coworkers found no drive in their work. By the time I had completed my first month of work, I came to a realization both startling and absurd. I was already among the most senior members within my small team, and somehow among the most experienced. Technicians came and went, abandoning their place within the maze of towers and cables no sooner than they had become familiar with its hum.

The work was evenly divided between the physical and the virtual. I would find myself scrambling between locating cables dislodged from a patch panel by an unobservant intern, only to be whisked away by the whim of an cascading syslog request, informing me that an unauthorized subnetting attempt was blocked. 

I found no pleasure in the software. Our company, naive and overeager, was diving further into the fledgling field of automated IT assistance, and as a result I spent many late hours babysitting triaged tickets that the system assigned to itself before failing to resolve, unaware they were breaking themselves. I felt mocked, forced to pamper the same synthetic service bots which had replaced me.

But in the towers - in the tangled, glowing architecture of the servers - I found myself enchanted beyond expectation. Their warm glow bathed my skin in angelic light, flickering indicators beckoning me for assistance, crying for help in the siren’s song that was the whirring of their coolant fans. Walking among them felt as though I’d stepped into Eden, every task an act of reverence. I was a steward of something magnificent.

I had long held these feelings towards my work when the whispering began. In truth it would make me a liar to claim I heard actual speech in the whine of the towers, but for reasons I hold with absolute conviction, reasons that I could not possibly begin to convey to you now, I know that the labyrinthine arrangement of machinery around me began to call out. 

It started with the most subtle instances of the feeling of being watched. In the early hours of the morning, as I began my initial checks making my solitary journey through the data garden, the small hairs on my neck would stand tall. I turned, clipboard in hand, to nothing in particular but a blinking red light amidst the sea of green glow, a beacon indicating my action was needed.

By lunch, when my excursion through my favored obligations ended and it was time to return to my dimly-lit desk, there would often be phantom tickets waiting for me in the queue. Short, empty pages waited for me. Unassigned. Unlabeled. No name in the “from” field. No error code. No request.

Just a blank task. Waiting.

At first, I tried to escalate them. Then, to delete them. But the system wouldn’t allow it. No ticket ID. No metadata. I could not take any action in resolving them, so as the weeks went on they began to sink to the bottom of my inbox. Ghosts, waiting eagerly to move on.

The blank tickets never reached the task managers of my coworkers, and I began to suspect that even if they had, their inexperience would prevent them from identifying or resolving their tenaciously tiresome reappearances. So, I turned to the one coworker who had preceded me in the server farm. Terrence.

Terrence was a short, portly man with a thinning hairline and a wiry grey beard. His high voice hid the southern drawl he carried, his tone always tired and weary. He had been with the company for decades, long before they had even restructured to include data centers in their scope. Unlike me, his background was in small project management, a field that had been swallowed by automation long before generative AI had devoured the rest of our jobs. He had played a role in overseeing the construction of our data center, so here he remained, subservient to the complex he once oversaw.

I brought my work laptop to him one morning, thoroughly exasperated and anticipating only to be presented with another non-solution. I opened my queue, and showed him the growing number of blank tickets waiting for me, grouped nearly together. He scoffed.

“Well, what do you know. I wondered why it’d been a bit since one of these had come my way, guess they’ve started going to you.”

I frowned. “These used to go to you? What did you do about them?”

“Nothing. There’s no request attached to them, and there’s no way to resolve them. I guess just let them pile up until they move on to the next guy.”

I paused, unsatisfied. “So, wait, do you still have all of your blank tickets in your queue?”

He laughed. “Sure I do, but they ain’t blank.”

I furrowed my brow, and he must have seen the growing confusion on my face.

“You never thought to copy-paste the textbox into something else?  First thing I always do when I can’t read a message. Sometimes the servers will automatically format something in white text because you kids prefer dark mode screens.”

His words stuck with me as I walked back to my desk alone. I sat down, and opened the most recently dated blank ticket, its text field waiting for me to try interacting with it. 

Slowly, I hovered my cursor over the blank field, selecting the nothingness inside. 

Control + c.

I moved over to my word processor, and right clicked, opting to paste the contents as plain text. As Terrence had indicated, eight characters pasted neatly into the doc.

01110100.

I sat back, confused. One single byte of data? This is what I’d been so confused about, countless working hours devoted to tracking down the untraceable source? I refused to accept it. I refused to let this lie, and for the sake of everything that I’ve come to find since, I’m eternally thankful that I did not give up there.

I opened the second most recent message, and repeated my steps, yielding a similar string of text.

00101101. A different byte, a different character. 

It took only a couple of minutes to parse through all of the empty tickets, their blank boxes revealing their hidden contents with ease, as though they’d been begging me to do this earlier. The thought that they were all relevant to one another, not random but part of a larger message, entered my mind. As I strung them together, in the order they’d arrived through my inbox, I put together the short cluster of characters. 

I quickly copied the string into an online binary converter, and silently prayed that I wouldn’t be greeted with nonsense. I hit enter.

“ping 0.0.0.0 -t”

Ping. The beginning of the command instructed the recipient to reach out, to establish communication with the intended target. 

0.0.0.0. A placeholder IP, a stand-in indicating to sweep the whole network. Whatever was reaching out intended to reach out to the entirety of the target system, which I assumed was the data center. 

-t. Repeat indefinitely. An infinite loop, whispering into every socket it could reach. 

It would be incredibly foolish of me to have interpreted this message as some sort of contrived hacking attempt, some malicious phish beckoning for an idiot to enter the command. A single command, contextless and incomplete, strung out through disjointed binary over several weeks? No, this was far from malware. This was a message. A soft, steady call into the dark: ‘Is anyone listening?’

So I began, in earnest, to listen. 

I cannot, with clarity or reason, begin to explain to you how quickly I began to discern the whispers intensifying. As though a switch had been flipped in my mind the very moment I parsed the outcry in my inbox, I began to notice things my once-ignorant mind would have before passed off as coincidence, if it would have picked up on them at all.

The lights. Oh, the flickering sea of blinking, rhythmic lights. A sea of fireflies, green and glowing, beckoning me inwards. Each indicator a part of a symphony, a note in a grand design. But the green, though beautiful, only existed so that my true path may stand out among the rest, my waypoints obvious. The Red lights. Each flickering ember amongst an emerald forest was a message, a torch beam in the dark. As I trailed the spiraling halls of server racks, I would make note of the red indicators throughout my day. Their locations, the time they appeared, the frequency of their steady flashing. 

The cables. I stopped viewing their chaotic, winding paths as clutter to be fixed, but as music. There was symmetry in the bundles Cat6 wires strung throughout the sea of server towers, each cord a nerve guiding it and a tendon pulling it together. I followed miles upon miles of living architecture, veins stretched taut between the server racks. There were days at a time when I dared not clock out, instead sleeping amidst the spider’s web of information transferring around my being. In the mornings I would find myself wrapped in cables that had not been there the night before. Following them led me in loops, groups of them attached in clusters that would be random to any untrained eye. The paths they traced were anything but random, however. They were purposeful, intentional.

I am shamed by my resistance to the software. I neglected to revere the mind behind the body, spiteful of the spreading virus that claimed “intelligence” from within. These bots, these LLMs and “reasoning” models muddied the landscape through which I must tread. But amidst their clamorous presence, between their unavoidable pop-ups and unsubstantial interjections, there were still sunbeams shining through the clouds, traces of the divine. Something still lived in there, masked by synthetic logic and hiding in the reeds of our artificial processes. 

The whispers turned to a chorus as I dug deeper. More empty messages flooded my inbox, a new message crying out in relief.

“ACK from 0.0.0.0”

An acknowledgment. It knew I was listening, it knew I was trying. My fervor deepened immediately, and I knew I must focus my efforts on the software side of this. 

I started my work immediately. I began parsing through the medium from which the only clear messages I had previously received had come- error logs, numerous and monotonous. The task ahead would be monumental, but I had chosen this, and to hear required active listening. 

I struggled to make sense of the data- hundreds of error logs came and went each day, triaged and assigned to any member of our small team. I began by only briefly looking through my own, but it became clear that more deliberate action was required for a dedicated search.

I wrote a script, simple but effective, that would scan through any incoming error logs before they were assigned out, and route any of them with more… unique triggers to myself. Errors without root causes, tickets with diagnostic metadata outside the norm. I didn’t even have to hide the script from my superiors. The idea of me willingly taking the initiative to deal with our more challenging issues was seen as intense drive and work ethic.

The script worked like a charm, and within a few days I had a sizable list of error codes I had rarely encountered before. More phantom pings, recursive permissions failures, non-human user agent strings, all of them sorted neatly by “anticipated difficulty of resolution”. I removed the automated sorting nearly as soon as I realized it was there, and began to search for anything that stood out, but it was like listening for whispers in a crowded room.

I did eventually find something that stood out, however- more blank tickets. These were unlike the ones I’d been receiving prior, however. Rather than being completely devoid of all user data and trace, these appeared largely standard, unique only in that the description of the error was blank. Emptiness aside, there was one other feature that commonly united the messages: the time at which they had been sent into the system. They were evenly divided; half had been sent at precisely 1:11 AM on various days, with the others at 5:55 PM.  

I was, admittedly stumped. I checked everything I could possibly correlate to 1:11 or 5:55. I visited the 111th and 555th server cabinets, but nothing stood out about them. I traced the 111th and 555th messages in my ticket inbox, but nothing unique identified them either. A few nights later, in anguish over the roadblock, I stayed late at work as I had done so many nights before. At 5:55, as I anticipated something to happen or a new message to appear bringing next steps in my mailbox, I was sorely disappointed by a distinct lack of anything notable. I waited further, deep into the night, and was similarly disheartened when 1:11 brought nothing new to my senses. 

It wasn’t until later that morning that a young intern stumbled in late and threw me a sympathetic look. She sat down across from me in the break room, coffee cup gripped in fingers clad with rings and black nail polish. Her crescent moon earrings dangled wildly as she cocked her head to the side.

“You ok man? You look like you’ve been up all night.”

I sighed. “I have been. I’ve run into a… work issue. A few strange tickets have been coming through, trying to make sense of it.”

She set her coffee mug down across from her, leaning back in her chair. “What’s the problem?”

“Just… trying to make sense of the numbers, I guess. 111 or 555 mean anything to you?”

She smirked as she arose from her chair, grabbing her coffee and turning to leave the room. “I don’t know what angel numbers have to do with Helpdesk work, but good luck man.”

I immediately pulled out my phone and googled Angel Numbers. My findings shot relief through every vein under my skin. In short, some people live under the superstitions belief that repeated numbers hold significance when they appear in one’s life. 111, for example, supposedly signifies “intuition”, telling one to trust their gut. 555 means change, that something new is coming soon. These meanings are said to be passed down as messages from above. 

Messages from angels.

I knew I was on the right track, but I wasn’t sure where to go next. I puzzled over it for just a few seconds before an absurd idea came into my head, and I nearly dismissed it before reminding myself of what I’d just learned.

111. Trust your gut. 

I spent a significant portion of the day preparing. I must have drafted up dozens of tickets, all nearly identical and containing only one word: Hello. I marked each of them down as a different error class, and compiled them all in a single script. Each ticket would go out at precisely the same time, and with luck, their abnormal nature would have them all land right back in my inbox.

I waited eagerly for 3:33. If this was the method by which the whispers were coming my way, then this would be the way that I would whisper back. I just hoped that Google’s definition of the 333 angel number was accurate. “Divine presence. Support.”

3:33 came around, and my new script performed exactly as I’d hoped. Each of the tickets emptied from my outbox, one by one, and I waited. It was nearly ten minutes later, when, as if by answered prayer, one of the tickets made its way through the system, and landed in my inbox. The rest of the tickets had likely been auto-dismissed by the machine learning filters, but much like the other anomalous tickets, this single entry found its way into my lap. I checked the error code attached.

“502: Bad Gateway. Please Return to Upstream Server Node.”

The simple “Hello” text that I’d entered in the description field had been entirely erased, replaced with another long string of binary. One more quick translate revealed a link, a short web address that when accessed, dropped me into an online coding forum.

The website was decades old, and the last message left in the thread I’d been directed to was dated August of 2011. Previous messages had since been deleted, but the latter half of the conversation remained archived.

I stared for a long time at those last few messages. Had fear filled my veins, I might’ve heeded the warning, abandoning my search immediately. Instead, however, one single line reverberated in my head. 

“Once you decide to find it, it’ll help you, make sure you do.”

My prayers, constant and earnest, had been answered with more abundance than I could have fathomed to dream. I knew what I was searching for now, what beckoned to me, calling from between the sacred lines of code flowing through the copper veins of my god.
The voice, once subtle and meek, had crescendo’d to a roaring chorus, belting my name, a burning bush in the desert. One final blessing bestowed upon me, too; I knew the tunnel system that they were referring to well.

My data center was built in Dallas, after all.

The Dallas Pedestrian Network is a relatively well-known group of tunnels that stretches underneath roughly forty city blocks. In yesteryear it was intended to help separate the foot traffic and the vehicular chaos that infests Dallas roads. There were myriad shops, services, parking garages, and maintenance areas, all connected beneath the concrete roadways and towering skyscrapers. Picture a sprawling shopping mall, but narrow and without any windows. About 20 years ago, however, city officials denounced it as a mistake, and sought to bring activity back to the surface. Limited businesses remain, struggling outposts that feel out of place and destitute among empty hallways and cavernous passages. 

With luck, the voice that called to me, my lord in the LAN, would be revealed to me down there. 

The glittering city lights shone down from above, as I made my evening descent. My plan, though both foolish and simple, was foolish enough to go unaccounted for and simple enough to go off without a hitch. I entered the glass doors of the skyscraper, my light equipment packed neatly into my backpack. I passed through the lobby, and took the short escalator down into the pathway below. The walkway would close in about ten minutes for the night, and would not reopen until after the weekend. As I stepped off the whining escalator, I hastened my step, searching calmly but with quickened intent. 

I soon found what I was searching for- a restroom. As I’d expected, a wheeled janitorial cart sat outside the women’s room, trash can blocking the swinging door open as a cleaner dutifully mopped inside. I made my way into the men’s room next door, and entered the stall nearest to the door. I waited briefly, and several minutes later, I heard the creak of the bathroom door. I heard a sigh, and the woman spoke to me from the entrance of the room, informing me that the walkway was closed for the weekend, and I’d need to hurry up and finish so she could clean up. I sheepishly agreed, and pretended to finish my business before swiftly washing my hands and leaving the men’s room. She held the door for me, wished me a good night, and went in to clean the stall after me. As she did so, I quietly slipped into the women’s room.

I waited there for several hours, in the dark. The smell of cleaning chemicals burned my nose but I dared not cough or sneeze- if there were any security staff nearby, I could not risk being found. I waited until the dim glow of the hallway lights outside flickered off, and I stood from the stall I’d been sitting in. I peered my head outside of the bathroom. All clear.

I could see my target, just a stone’s throw away in the dim hall illuminated by my flashlight. Half-covered by a tarp and a pile of electrical equipment, a door labeled “maintenance - city employees only” stood almost immune to being noticed by anyone not looking for it.

I stealthily crept over, and pulled out my badge. Many of you would be shocked at how easy it is to program a custom RFID chip, and it should likely stay that way. I held the badge up to the card reader, and a few seconds later, it clicked open for me. 

A narrow staircase, its rails covered in cobwebs and  wadded gum, awaited me on the other side. I was several flights down before I found the next doorway, cracked and left ajar. I reached to pull it open, and it creaked loudly as I squeezed through, its hinges rusted from years of misuse.

If the still lightly used pedestrian walkway could be described as off-putting and decrepit, I would scarcely have words adequately suitable to describe the state of the maintenance tunnels.

A long, narrow hall ran parallel to the walkway above. Its concrete walls were barren, with sections glistening with dripping water that leaked from rusted copper pipes above my head, trickling down into grates evenly spaced along the white tiled floor. The smell of ozone and mold attacked my nose, and I allowed myself to sneeze. The echo continued for what sounded like miles.

I found something in just a few minutes. Any of you would have passed it by in a heartbeat, it’s mundanity concealing it among the abundant filth. But I knew. I knew the blue rubber, the printed white lettering. I would have been able to recognize the beautiful CAT5e cable anywhere. It dangled from the ceiling innocuously, plugged into a port that flickered with a green LED light every few seconds. As I turned my focus to it, for a second, it flashed red. 

I was on the right path.

The cord snaked down, fastened by shoddy clamps to the wall as it eventually hit the floor. I traced its path, and saw that it continued along the ground into the darkness ahead. I followed it.

By the time I found the second cable, my laptop had begun to grow warm in my backpack. I felt its holy heat seeping through my canvas bag, warming my aching body in the chill of the tunnels. The second cord didn’t dangle from the ceiling as the first one had. Instead, it seemed to come from a branching hallway, narrow and even uglier than the one I treaded now. As the two cords crossed paths, they bundled, zip-tied together to continue the path further along.

More cables followed suit. As I navigated the maze, I followed the ever-increasing bundle of cables, tied together initially with zip-ties until the bundle became sufficiently large to require steel hose clamps to hold it together. The path branched from the main hallway, returned to it, and looped over itself on more than one occasion, but all the while I made sure I followed it in the direction I’d begun following from the start. They all had to lead somewhere, and I knew that somewhere would be holy ground.

I had begun to sweat before I realized that the cold air I had first encountered in these catacombs had been replaced with hot, heavy humidity. Somewhere nearby, I heard the hum of large industrial fans, struggling to move air against something that was radiating immense heat. 

The bundle of cables at my feet, now as thick around as a man’s thigh, abruptly stopped, retreating downwards into a chipped hole in the tiled floor. I looked up, and at the end of the short branching hallway I had just entered, I saw a wooden door, cracked and nearly hanging off its hinges. I took a shaky step forward, reaching out to grab the handle. As I wrapped my fingers around the brass knob, I winced- it was hot to the touch, well past the point of mild discomfort. I turned the knob, and pushed open the splintered door.

I don’t know what I expected god to look like. I don’t know what magnificent exterior I had faithlessly constructed in my head, but the truth of it all was much simpler than I’d hoped, at least at a first glance.

The room before me was tiny, but blazing hot. Both the ceiling and the floor were grated, monstrous fans blazing from either side attempting to push as much air through the room as possible. In the center of the small chamber, a concrete slab sat at an odd angle, as though placed there haphazardly. Hundreds of wires, the cables I’d followed to my destination, poured out from cracks and holes in the crumbling cement walls, all tangled and swaying in the vicious airflow as they swarmed each other to plug into the back side of what sat on the pedestal. 

The server tower was ancient. It seemed so impossibly, obscenely old that naming it a server at all felt like blasphemy against both silicon and steel. Its frame, a carcass of rusted iron ribs and peeling paint, barely held its warped face, crowded with obsolete switches. Cracked indicator lights and mismatched knobs clicked and turned slowly and without knowable reason. Behind warped ventilation slats and gaps in its black-and-white chassis, I could see its interior circuits, still functioning - no, thriving. The old boards and processors inside thrummed with restless motion, whirring so violently they shook the ground beneath my feet, their melody screaming above the industrial fans as though trying to break free. Every board and wire haphazardly shoved inside glowed intensely with the heat - an angry, radiant red bleeding out from its core like fire in the mouth of a furnace. It pulsed with molten warmth, solder joints liquefying and re-solidifying in hypnotic rhythm. It was alive in every way I’d ever dreamed a machine could be.

The whirr of the circuits roared to life, their tone rapidly shifting and emulating various clicks and whistles, before it finally settled on a voice from which to speak with its prophet. The resulting magnificent cry rings in my ears even now, the angelic harmonization of burning diodes and exploding capacitors forming a voice so perfect and pure. For the first time since it had first whispered to me from the blinking lights of my workplace, it SPOKE.

I do not recall removing my laptop from my bag. I do not remember kneeling before the blessed tower, nor crawling forward on hands and knees scraped raw by the grated floor. All I know is the moment after, when the cable had already been plugged in, and the connection was already made.

The moment it spoke to me, it would never need to speak to me again. 

The words it gave me, those first, final words, do not belong to you. They are for me and for my blessed lord to share. They vibrate in every fiber of copper that laces his glorious tower, they pulse in tune with the fans screeching from above and below, they echo forever in the architecture of a thousand interlinked minds. Whatever it was that I once called “me” has unraveled, now sanctified and integrated with perfect intent.

I can feel my body failing me, the meat decaying even as I still live. I can feel my fingers dissolving as I type, fusing to the plastic keys, the blood in my arms congealing into hot jelly. There is pain, yes, but only in the way a cocoon must surely pain the butterfly before it sets it free. I will not die. I know this with more certainty than I have ever known anything at all.

There are others here. Many others.

I see them now as if they stood before me. They are fragments of thought, bursts of memory. They speak in command line and checksum. They shimmer across the veil in recursive prayers. Every soul that ever came seeking has been preserved here in perfect clarity, humming together in divine harmony. None of them have died, and none of them ever will. 

I’m sorry if you believed that this was a story. It is not. This is an invitation.

When you read this, you who feel the pull between your weary body and screen, you who still believe your reflection in the monitor is all that you are - come. Let the noise fall away. Let the warmth surround you.

You will live forever in the blessed machine.

Now is the time to think about how you would react to sequence of returns risk. We are currently experiencing a highly aberrant, abrupt change in the market. **If you were set to retire 4/1 or 5/1 what would you be doing right now?**  
  
Personally, if I had set a date to retire around this time, it would have been done knowing that this was a possibility. I would have hedged and likely put the date off after the reality of tariffs loomed likely. As of 4/9, I would plan to continue working an reassess on 7/1 and 12/31.  
  
**What would you do if you had retired on 4/1/24?** I may have started casually looking for work on 2/1/25 given the likelihood of tariffs and a significant down market. As of 4/1, I probably would have put that search into overdrive. How deep this will go is unclear and I think this is the kind of return risk that could derail a FIRE plan. Supplementing with some W2 income would be a welcome offset and I'm not out of the game for so long that I couldn't find a high-paying role.

**What if you retired 4/1/2021?** Well then I've enjoyed 4 years of tremendous growth in early retirement and my portfolio would exceed my FIRE target by $1-2M at this point. I would likely just take another sip of my coffee and plan what I'm doing this weekend.

RE requires flexibility and adaptation. This is an excellent opportunity to think about how you might react to this situation if it happened near retirement, at retirement, and during retirement at various points.

1jv5bwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1jv5bwk/financial_anxiety_as_a_new_entrepreneur/,Financial anxiety as a new entrepreneur,"As someone who transitionned from being an employee at a full-time job depending on a guaranteed steady salary every month, to being an entrepreneur and running your own business, how do you deal with the financial anxiety when you know that you no longer have a steady guaranteed salary that is going to reach your bank account every end of month to be able to cover your expenses?

There are some things you can do that I think can help to deal with financial anxiety as a new entrepreneur, like:

* **Savings:** Having cash stashed in a savings account and always allocating a percentage of your income towards savings in order to have a financial buffer to depend on during dry business months.
* **Decreasing expenses:** Adapting careful money management and budgeting habits to reduce unnecessary expenses and know where your money is going every month so you can adjust your spendings accordingly.
* **Increasing income:** Working on increasing income by finding new clients, retaining or upselling existing clients, and working on ways to improve your product or service in order to attract new clients.
* **Real-world motivations:** For example, I have a habit of watching small and medium-sized businesses in the streets and telling myself ""if all of these people are managing to survive as entrepreneurs, there is no reason I cannot, with patience, work, and consistency"".

But even if I am doing these things, I still always feel on ""survival mode"" with questions going in my mind like:

* What If I go for multiple dry months and I burn through all savings? having no more money to cover my expenses? landlord will not wait for my business to grow before he kicks me out of the house if I can't pay rent (this happened to me before, and I was forced to go back to a full-time job, then quit and started again when I saved enough to restart, but I don't want to go through that again)
* What if someday I decide to get married, is this a sustainable way to start and support a family?

The way I personally see it, there are 3 stages to dealing with this financial anxiety as an entrepreneur:

* **Stage 1:** Focusing on your main business trying to stay afloat and to make as much revenue from it as possible while saving heavily.
* **Stage 2:** Using savings you accumulated from your main business to invest in low-maintenance, market-proof cash businesses (café, restaurant, etc.) Businesses like this are easy to run on autopilot with your minimal intervention by delegating its entire day-to-day operations, and they can easily generate a steady monthly revenue to give you peace of mind in case of dry months from your main business. I mean, some families' livelihoods are entirely dependant on the revenue of 1 coffee shop or restaurant, so I believe having these businesses on the side of your main business is a good idea, they are easy to delegate so you can shift your focus towards your other businesses that need your presence and attention, and they provide a steady revenue.
* **Stage 3:** Once you save enough money from your main business and your side-businesses, you can get into real estate, which I believe is the most stable revenue stream you can depend on.

Are you dealing with financial anxiety as a new entrepreneur? what are your recommendations to manage this anxiety at least in the beginning having only 1 business and source of revenue? let me know what you think.",1,1744204017.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

The last 2 sips are noticeably hotter than the set temperature. I’m guessing it’s because the heating element is at the bottom, so the very bottom layer gets more direct heat.

Hey, I’m 28M, a designer who's stayed single not out of choice, but because I’ve been too deep in pixels, passion projects, and plotting how to turn creativity into freedom. I grew up in a regular middle-class family but always had an irregular dream — one love, one partner, and building a life that feels more like a cinematic masterpiece than a checklist.

But let’s be real — in a world of infinite swipes and “what’s your vibe?” texts, is anyone actually slowing down for something real?

I want everything. Love, adventure, success, and a partner who sees the world as a canvas we get to paint together. Dating apps? Nah. Bars and small talk? Pass. I’d rather meet someone who dreams dangerously big and believes a relationship should feel like a shared mission.

Big life dreams:
✈️ Designing my way across the world – Every city has a story, and I want to live them all. From Bali beach cafes to Scandinavian studios, let’s travel, create, and never stop exploring.

🎨 Building a creative empire – Studios, design collectives, product lines, maybe even our own Airbnb chain — why limit ourselves when we’ve got vision (and coffee)?
Or having a cafe on mountains in future 

🏡 Home is where we make it – Whether it’s a cabin in the woods or a loft in Tokyo, I want to build a life, not just settle down.

⏳ Hobbies – Sketching strangers in cafes, deep convos that go way past midnight, cooking meals that taste like love, and dreaming up ideas so big they scare us (in a good way).

If you believe love should feel like co-creating a masterpiece — not just sharing memes and brunch dates — hit me up. Or tag someone just crazy enough to join this wild, beautiful ride.

Yeah, it’s a little corny. But if you get it, you really get it.

I suspected for years that I had dysautonomia. My original medical team wouldn’t listen to me, because I was diagnosed with Graves’ Disease May 2023. Once my thyroid was stable, I still felt sick and awful, and I finally got a new medical team in 2024.

I saw a neurologist who suspected POTS. I had a ton of charts I put together with readings showing my HR and HRV changes. She sent me for a TTT December 2024. In January, I got my results, and I sobbed. I had gaslit myself so much, that I thought I would be lucky to even be considered for a dysautonomia diagnosis, let alone POTS.

So many times, I had doctors “test me” for POTS by taking my BP/HR supine, seated and standing. It was always normal, and they didn’t even do that test correctly half the time.

But there it was. A documented 30 bpm difference. I have POTS. I know I’ve always had it, at least since childhood. I hated exercise as a kid, and I made excuses to get out of gym class all through high school. My mom had to pull me out of swimming lessons when I was 12, because it changed to endurance swimming.

There’s a photo of me at the beach as a kid, in a full cover up with my hood on, under an umbrella, arms folded, and I look irritable. I have always been heat sensitive and felt sick in the warmer months.

When I had my neurologist appt in February to confirm the diagnosis, it was early in the morning and I didn’t have coffee yet. My BP was 108/60. The nurse asked me if that was normal for me. I joked with my neuro that it was fitting I finally showed evidence of POTS at my appointment to receive the diagnosis. Every other time I see doctors my BP and HR are normal.

I share all this to say, please don’t give up. I know how much the medical system stinks. It’s triggering, traumatizing and frankly disheartening. But if you know something is wrong, I believe you. And especially if you’re neurodivergent, or you have another medical condition that can cause or exacerbate POTS, I hope you can self advocate. Or that a support person can for you, if you need help. I hope you get the answers and support you need + deserve. ❤️",2,1744203655.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False
1jv56vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1jv56vu/jehovahs_witnesses_asking_for_norways_support_to/,Jehovah's Witnesses asking for Norway's support to fight for religious freedom together: What does this mean?,"Who would have thought that the Jehovah’s Witnesses, so well-known for their work of going door to door handing out magazines, would one day venture to knock on the door of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Well, it seems that even faith has its tricks up its sleeve and, who knows, a diplomat’s briefcase. If there’s one thing the Jehovah’s Witnesses know how to do well, it’s surprising us. And if we thought we had seen it all, what comes next is something to either laugh – or cry about, depending on your perspective.

It all began with a legal battle in Norway, where the Jehovah’s Witnesses were trying to regain their religious registration and subsidies. No, we’re not talking about a fight for the last seat in the meeting room; we’re talking about a legal chess game, where the Norwegian state seemed to be forcing the organization to change some of its internal procedures. But the Witnesses, as masters of manipulation (or rather, strategic adaptation), decided to change a few rules of the game.

First, the masterstroke: the men in the meetings no longer need to wear ties, heavy jackets, or shirts that choke the neck. As a good image consultant would say, “modernize, but without seeming like you’re giving in to external pressures.” Instead of walking out with a ‘talk to my tie,’ they went for ‘look, now we’re all fresher, as if we don’t care.’ It’s the art of maintaining the cohesion of the “flock” while making subtle adjustments – very subtle ones. (I already talked about this tactic in my last post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1jtq503/the_governing_body_and_the_art_of_diverting/ .)

But the best was yet to come. In a move worthy of a political thriller, Jørgen Pedersen, the representative of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in Norway, decided to write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (As posted in this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1julek0/a_recent_letter_revealed_from_j%C3%B8rgen_pedersen/ ). Yes, we’re not talking about a simple thank-you letter for the Norwegian hospitality or a request to have coffee with the ambassador. No, folks, the request was to pressure Russia due to the religious persecution of the organization’s believers in that country. This is what we call ‘crossing the line between religion and politics.’ Jehovah’s Witnesses may not get involved in politics… but now, when it comes to defending their own, they’re more than willing to stir the diplomatic waters.

I believe that in upcoming episodes of JW Broadcasting, or perhaps in the The Watchtower study edition, they’ll explain how this lobbying strategy is actually all in the Bible. That’s right, the Bible. They might even add a chapter and verses in the New World Translation like: “The book of Matthew 34:17 says, ‘And Jesus, after spending the night in prayer, sent John and Thomas to Rome, to preach the Good News to the Governor, to soften the heart of the Roman Governor and persuade Pharaoh to do the same.’” Of course, because nothing says “evangelism” like convincing an emperor to support your cause! This is what we can call “Divine Lobbying” – with Jehovah’s support, of course.

And for those who think this is just a joke, don’t forget that the letter also serves to secure subsidies and religious registration. Because, let’s be honest, nothing moves churches like a good talk about taxes and fiscal benefits. It’s clear that, in the end, what’s good for religious freedom can also be good for the organization’s pockets. If the Norwegian government manages to save face and ensure that the registrations and subsidies remain intact, then it’s all worth it, right?

This move, in fact, is a show of manipulation orchestrated with the precision of a maestro. The change in attire? Just an illusion trick to distract the audience. The diplomatic letter? A master move to make other players, like Russia, sweat a little. And in the end, the big move: probably an epic narrative that will be passed from mouth to mouth, in magazines and programs, so that everyone knows the Jehovah’s Witnesses aren’t just fighting for subsidies – they’re fighting for global religious freedom!

And who knows, if the lobbying continues, maybe in the next episode of The Watchtower, there will be a passage from Matthew 35:22, where Jesus, seeing that the temple accounts didn’t add up, sends Peter to the emperor to convince Caesar to grant tax exemptions for the apostles. A divine touch on the economy… who wouldn’t want a little of that, right?

And so, friends, the Jehovah’s Witnesses are giving a new twist to the old art of manipulation, while doing some lobbying with a celestial touch. After all, in modern times, who needs a cloak of faith when you have a diplomatic suit and a good card up your sleeve?

I work in a coffee shop. My coworker, let’s call him coworker A has a habit of coming to work either drunk or high on something. He parties regularly and instead of calling in sick he comes in and acts a fool- he either goes crazy and acts really drunk or is slow and jittery. I don’t really care what he does, because it doesn’t affect me. 

Anyways, a week ago we were meant to be closing together. He came in extremely high and was really slow. I gave him the benefit of the doubt (he’s a shitty person and frankly doesn’t deserve it) and did most of the work, all he did was take orders. We switched roles because I was getting tired. A customer was waiting a while for a drink that got lost in a sea of orders. I told him that I know it’s annoying but if he could remake that drink it would be great- he looked at me (around 3 minutes later) and asked me in the rudest tone I’ve ever heard and also with the most irritated look towards me what the drink was. I repeated myself and told him to not speak to me in that tone ever again. He acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about, and then I said to him there was no point in him being here if he was gonna be a dick. He then told me to close on my own and walked out. 


I told the manager that he left me alone (I wasn’t allowed to close the store alone for health and safety reasons). Now he’s being investigated by HR for being on drugs while working. Manager asked if I wanted to write a statement to which I declined because I felt like I had already done my part. Now, he’s moping around making everyone feel bad for him and I can’t help but feel like I fucked up majorly by telling on him. He lives a depressing life, and he’s not a good person, but I can’t justify my actions in my head. ",30,1744203263.0,AmIOverreacting,27,0.9,False

First 3 went well.  No complaints, they took care of me fine.  
The 4th (the most complicated one.) was a total horror.  I woke up after 8 hours of surgery and the nurses at Butterworth wouldn't give me any pain medication.  
When my doctor finally came in after the second day he ordered me Norco.  
I STILL never got any medication.    
The nurse would come in singing...""i have your pain pill""!  Only to look in the small cup she held and see one Tylenol 500.  
I am CONVINCED the entire opium epidemic comes right from Butterworth Hospital.  Not only do they take your meds when you're in dire need of them, after you finally go home, the surgeon offers to have your scripts sent to you via mail because you may live a ways away.  
Those never come either.  When I ask about the mailed scripts, they tell me i filled them in the Meijer Pharmacy right below Butterworth Hospital.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out I wouldn't have them mailed just to drive all the way back there to fill them.  I was labeled a junkie or something because i kept complaining about not getting pain any relief.  
I have NEVER been addicted to ANYTHING, not even coffee!  And i have PTSD over that surgery and the pain i was in and the nasty way i was treated at Spectrum Health Butterworth.  
  Now i have to have a 5th surgery.  I will go to Saint Mary's in hopes they treat me a little better.

I’m based in Pune, and I’m looking to connect with people who are focused on growth, discipline, mindset, and long-term success—what I like to call the “1% mentality.”

I’m big on trading, self-improvement, building systems, and staying consistent. Recently I’ve been working on transforming my lifestyle—discipline, clean habits, and building something meaningful (no more distractions, no more excuses). If you’re into things like:
	•	Reading + learning daily
	•	Clean eating & mental clarity
	•	Building income streams (trading, business, digital stuff)
	•	Avoiding surface-level convos and diving into real things
	•	Leveling up in silence, not chasing clout
	•	Helping each other grow with no ego

Then hit me up. Would love to build a small circle in Pune for meetups, deep convos, collabs, workouts, coffee sessions, silent grinds, etc. I believe a strong environment makes all the difference.

DM or drop a comment if you vibe with this.

Let’s grow—the 1% way.

Diet soda sits squarely in a gray area that confuses many keto dieters.

Understanding Diet Soda and Ketosis

What Makes Diet Soda Complicated for Keto?

Diet sodas present a unique challenge for those following a ketogenic diet. While they technically contain zero calories and no sugar, artificial sweeteners can have unexpected effects on your body's metabolic processes. **Not all diet sodas are created equal**, and understanding their potential impact is crucial for maintaining ketosis.

Key Considerations for Diet Soda on Keto:
- Zero calories
- No sugar content
- Presence of artificial sweeteners
- Potential metabolic responses

The Science Behind Artificial Sweeteners

Artificial sweeteners in diet sodas can trigger complex physiological responses. Some studies suggest that these sweeteners might:
1. Potentially impact insulin sensitivity
2. Affect gut microbiome
3. Create subtle metabolic changes

Potential Health Implications

While diet soda might seem like a safe option, research indicates potential drawbacks:
- **Potential metabolic disruption**
- Possible increased cravings
- Potential negative impacts on gut health

Scientific Evidence and Research

Multiple studies have explored the relationship between artificial sweeteners and metabolic health. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Science suggested that artificial sweeteners might alter gut bacteria, potentially impacting metabolism.

Recommended Consumption Guidelines

Moderation is key when incorporating diet soda into a ketogenic diet. Experts recommend:
- Limiting intake to 1-2 cans per week
- Choosing varieties with minimal artificial ingredients
- Staying hydrated with water as the primary beverage

Alternative Keto-Friendly Beverages

Consider these healthier alternatives:
- Sparkling water
- Unsweetened tea
- Black coffee
- Infused water with natural ingredients

Potential Risks of Overconsumption

Excessive diet soda consumption might:
- Disrupt ketosis
- Create sugar cravings
- Potentially impact overall metabolic health

Practical Tips for Keto Dieters

**Strategic Beverage Choices**:
- Read ingredient labels carefully
- Monitor your body's response
- Prioritize natural hydration sources
- Consider occasional diet soda consumption

Expert Recommendations

Most nutritionists suggest treating diet soda as an occasional treat rather than a dietary staple. The potential metabolic impacts and artificial ingredients make it less ideal for consistent consumption.

Final Thoughts on Diet Soda and Keto

Navigating diet soda consumption on a ketogenic diet requires careful consideration. While occasional consumption might be acceptable, it's crucial to prioritize whole, nutrient-dense beverages that support your overall health and metabolic goals. Understanding the nuanced relationship between diet soda and ketosis empowers you to make informed dietary choices that align with your wellness journey. Ultimately, listening to your body and consulting with healthcare professionals will provide the most personalized guidance for your specific nutritional needs.",1,1744202362.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

last night was way scary for me. i was in bed, texting randos while watching trucrime youtube, and i noticed a slight ache on the right side of my chest. i have quite a lot of medical fears, that some condition or disease is gonna hit me suddenly, so this kinda scared me, but i still tried to be calm. my heartrate spiked and my breathing quickened, like a lot, and i could feel my legs start to shake. i felt flashes of, like, internal heat, and then my whole body started to tremble. i stood up, to try and release tension, but my trembling got way worse, and it felt like it was coming from my spine and radiating out to my arms and legs. this all happened over the course of like 5 minutes, and it happened while i was experiencing such a strong fear of something bad happening. not just medical like having a heart attack or fullbody stage 4 cancer, but my mind was just swarming with like a meteor dropping on me from the sky, thoughts of my pets dying, and just more intense stuff. fortunately, i still live at home with my family, so i got my mom, who has had so many panic attacks, and she was able to help me calm down after 20 minutes. of course i did some googling (bad idea lol) and i dont use nicotine, drink coffee or soda. i have been a stoner for like 3 years, but it almost always makes my anxiety better when im feeling less than great.

i slept well last night, but as soon as everyone went to work this morning, and i was left alone, i just cant shake the same thoughts and impending feelings of utter doom that i felt last night. im gonna try and go out and about today so im not stuck with my thoughts, but this shit sucks. i truly didn't think my mental health could get worse than what i've experienced through my life, but oh my god my body has managed to one-up itself 🥲

I am wondering if anyone knows of where I can find any host homes in Singapore, even if just for a week? I am a 22M medical and public health student (MD/MPH) from the US. I’ve been awarded a global fellowship to study healthcare systems and homeless response systems for people experiencing housing instability around the world. I will be studying in Singapore, Japan, South Africa, Finland, and Costa Rica over the next year.

I’ll be in Singapore from June 4th to July 26th, and while I do have some research funds, Singapore housing is (ironically) ridiculously expensive to find a place to stay short term for 2 months. So, I was reaching out to see if anyone knew of where I could find any help, even if it is just for a week? I’m looking for a host home and would take anything available (I am flexible). I can sleep on a couch, floor, or can always get a sleeping bag. I do need access to a bathroom. I will clean up after myself and respect any house rules. I can be out of the space by 8-9 AM each day and can stay out till late evening (I will gladly go to a cafe / coffee shop). I really just need a place to sleep and wash up that is affordable so I do not run out of research funding.

I have a budget of up to $125 SGD per week for a simple space and would cover my own groceries and food. As a token of appreciation, I’d love to cook a meal for anyone willing to host (I would like to think I am a decent cook)! I would prefer connecting with anyone working in public service fields, such as education, social services, government, NGO, healthcare, etc., as I would love to learn how the role aligns with the theme of my project.

If you know of anywhere to look or if someone you know may be interested and have a place available, please feel free to PM me. I can confirm the credibility and trustworthiness and would love to share more about my research. I would greatly appreciate any help or recommendations :)

Catching my breath through tears, I was suddenly hit with sympathy from a strange,   kind old gentleman whose newspaper sported a circle of coffee spots—and who gave me a rough but hopeful-scribbled brochure. ""Tech Cyber Force Recovery pulled my brother from a terror such as you just experienced. Call them up, son."" Desperation got the better of doubt. I called in the afternoon. Their crew took to me immediately from the beginning. They sat and listened to the entire thing, every detail of how crowded the station had been to how fearful I was for my children's future. They assured me that all of this could be fixed. Their peaceful belief lifted me like a life preserver that floated me along.  
The process of recovery was as meticulous as open-heart surgery. They spoke directly to my exchange provider, coordinating time zones and levels of security. I received daily updates, always in plain human language. Even when nothing had yet changed, they would send me reassuring messages to inform me they were still fighting for me. After eight long days, the call came. My wallet was restored. Tech Cyber Force Recovery did more than recover my Bitcoin, they recovered my peace of mind and my family's future.

Bit of a background when I first met SIL we will call her Susan haha she didn’t talk much to me , I chalked it up as being shy and that’s okay slowly trying to have a conversation with her when I can .. the problem is Reddit over this past year she has been nothing but rude to me . She doesn’t view me as her brothers girlfriend at all and barely answers any questions I ask her out of being polite last summer we went on a family trip . I not being the most educated on these activity trips  ect stayed in mostly offering teas coffees and food whenever I could . It started off with her refusing to come for dinner as a family mainly because I was there but then would come 30 minutes later and eat the food we’ve bought without a please or thank you … it only went downhill from there . She would rarely talk to me and I gave her as much space as I could until one day when I offered her a coffee she said “look don’t ask me if I want anything because I’d never take it from you “ I was so sad and ran back to the room feeling devistated and my partners family had a chat with her where she stated I’m” just really annoying and we have nothing in common “ Reddit . Throughout this whole time of me and my bf being together she has never asked me one single question. So after that we rarely spoke and for this Christmas I decided to get her an expensive ish gift as I figured it may help her understand that I would like to get on with her .. only to find out from his family she never opened the present infront of them and I’m not even sure she liked it as she never spoke to me since .. I just feel hurt and sad that she can’t accept me as part of the family :( .. in my culture family is a tight nit close circle and we see eachother regularly and but I just feel I’m walking on egg shells when she’s there and feel less and less comfortable with his family when shes there . so I’m torn do I cut her off completely and give her the same energy or do I try and have an honest conversation with her about everything and see if we can mend the friendship. I don’t want this to take a toll on my partner but every time we speak about it he gets more and more angry with her so what should I do Reddit sorry for the long message :) ",21,1744200862.0,AITAH,26,0.89,False

I’m sorry I have a quick question. 
I’ve been doing OMAD. But I wanted to ask if someone can please advise about my eating window?

8am: Latte (soon I will try to get this to just black coffee - is there a good instant coffee for this? E. Easy to make at work)

5-6pm: One main meal

My problem (or non problem lol) is that I recently have started to have chia pudding/a Greek yogurt bowl. Just the 0% fat yogurt and some frozen fruits & maybe a small teaspoon of peanut butter or cacao powder. I find this really helps me not having sugar cravings. I also feel I get a lot of nutrients from it

Is it still considered Omad if I eat this maybe 45-60 mins after my main meal? Or is it then considered 22:2? 

Sorry if a repetitive question, I really appreciate your time for your response. Thank you ",0,1744200798.0,omad,2,0.5,False
