1hpamrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hpamrq/montale_sample_set_review/,Montale Sample Set Review,"I got the Montale sample set for Christmas and I've had a lot of fun testing the scents. Montale is a different beast, especially for someone who tends to prefer more photorealistic scent profiles like those from Dipthyque.

I had some loves, some dislikes, and some absolute scrubbers but it's been fun to explore and the scents sparked some fun memories and conversations with my husband. He grew up in the middle east and a lot of the Montale scents brought him back to childhood!

Anyway, on to the scents. For each scent I only sprayed one spray and damn if these scents don't project!

Arabians Tonka - This scent is described as a Woody Amber and the dry down was very much pure wood for me. Not in a bad way, it was a very lovely Oud, sweet Tonka dry down that worked nicely with my personal chemistry. Opening spary was BEAUTIFUL and I could absolutely smell every note as described. I wish this scent stuck closer to the open, and if it did I would consider a full size bottle. Overall a nice scent and the projection and longevity were BEAST MODE. Could smell it 12 hrs later.

Roses Musk - This scent is described as a Musky Floral. I am a BIG rose lover, but this was a scrubber for me. Something about Montale's white musk note is a death note for me if it isn't combined with Vanilla or another sweet note. This rose is screeching, synthetic, and just awful on me. The white musk dry down turns into an unpleasant peppery musk on me. Just awful. Projection was enormous. Unsure of longevity since i had to scrub but I'd imagine it lasts 12 hrs.

Intense Cafe - This os described as a Floral Gourmand which I found quite accuarate. I adored this scent both on the open and the dry down. The opening smelled strongly of lokum / turkish delight and the ddry down smelled slightly less powdery like sugared rose with a tiny hint of coffee. Projection and longevity were excellent. I may end up purchasing a full bottle if I continue to enjoy it on rewears.

Day Dreams - This is described as a Fruity Floral Gourmand which was quite accurate. Thos was pretty screechy on the open but dry down was basically a soft sweet but clearly synthetic Tiare flower. Not bad at all, but I much prefer a more natural, beachy Tiare. Again, excellent projection and longevity.

Velvet Fantasy - This was described as a Warm & Sweet Gourmand. For me this really lacked sweetness, which I think was likely just how it reacted to my personal chemistry. Citrus tends to not be great for me, and this one really felt like citrusy pine sol on the open and like a slightly amber old spice after dry down. This probably had the most intense projection of the bunch and it reminded my husband of childhood trips to the mall. A fun conversation starter, but definitely not for me.

Amber Musk - This was described as Soft Amber but for me was anything but. For some reason, with the Montale scents the amber barely shows up for me, so paired with the white musk it just turned into a straight black pepper smell. Enormous projection but another scrubber.

Lucky Candy - This is described as a Warm & Sweet Gourmand. It was definitely sweet. The open was a very bug spray frangipani and honey smell for me and it dried to a VERY sweet ""perfumy"" musk. It wasn't bad at all but slightly too synthetic for my personal taste. Again, good projection and longevity.

Overall, I had some loves and some hates but I can completely respect how much of a beast these scents are when it comes to longevity and projection!

1hpakdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1hpakdj/childfree_friends_expect_things_to_go_back_to/,Childfree friends expect things to go back to normal post birth? ,"Hey, not sure if anyone here has had this before but if so I was just looking for some advice on how best to handle it! 

I (31f) am currently expecting my first child early next year and I'm so excited/nervous. I'm fully planning to breastfeed if I can and have several mummy friends who have been giving me lots of advice which is so lovely. 

I've got two close childfree friends who I used to meet with fairly regularly pre-pregnancy for wine nights (f35 + f33), where it wasn't uncommon to go through a couple of bottles between us. This would typically happen about once a month or so, nothing crazy (tipsy/happy/laughy stage but nothing else), but a good catch up and set the world to rights. 

There has been a drop in the frequency of meeting up since I fell pregnant, and my friends will still meet up for wine and invite me along but going along to join as they are drinking excessively feels uncomfortable to me now. So whilst I've joined for a few lunches, I've skipped any evening plans/night outs. Quite honestly, whilst a glass of wine or two with a meal sounds lush post pregnancy, going ""out out"" or getting drunk sounds awful to me now! I know things might change post birth, though I highly doubt it at this point as I do feel like I've outgrown that stage of my life. Unfortunately it feels like my friends haven't realised that yet. There have been a few comments about how I never join them anymore, or that as soon as I'm no longer pregnant they're dragging me out for a night out. I've laughed this off and said no, as I plan to breastfeed I'll be off alcohol for a while to lots of booing. 

I tried to broach a couple of times that I'm not interested in joining for a messy one at this point and to not worry about inviting me. But that i'd definitely be up for joining a few less alcohol related outings, coffee catch ups and country walks etc. That has worked well enough with one friend (f35), but not so much rbe other sadly. 

Tomorrow is f35's birthday, and the plan was we'd all drive to a local(ish) cafe for tea and lunch. Since then, f33 has mentioned she'll be training it in so she can drink, leading to f35 to agree to do the same. Now I've no problem if people want to drink around me, but getting hammered around me whilst I am sober feels so awkward though appreciate I'll need to suck it up as it's her birthday. However in our group chat earlier, f35 told me that I need to make sure I'm not pregnant or ready to ""pump and dump"" by this time next year as she wants a messy one. I feel this is an unreasonable request considering, as whilst I don't plan to have a second one immediately, I also don't want to put my life on hold for a night out a year away! 

So as a TLDR, two close friends are very much in a ""we'll go back to regular wine nights post birth"". That doesn't interest me nor seem feasible - has anyone else had a similar situation and found a good way to handle this? ",0,1735519264.0,pregnant,2,0.5,False

(If you've messaged me before, feel free to message me again!) I am looking for a serious traditional gender roles relationship within the USA (I am willing to relocate eventually for the right person!) Everyday I strive to be a better version of myself, with God's help❤️ Below are some things about me:

•Green/blue eyes and glasses
•25 years old, birthday is in the summer
•Thick/BBW/Curvy (on a weightloss journey though!)

•Gardening and farm experience
•Christian- I always strive to be a Proverbs 31 woman
•Wants kids someday
•Wishes to be a stay at home wife and work on my work from home career goal
•Educated in mental health so very good at reading people and what they may need (will be putting my future husband's needs above all else, especially mentally and emotionally and of course physically)

•trying for kids - right away after being married






Here's a little about what I look forward to:


I'll get up early while he still sleeps and get his lunch ready, pack a little note in there. If it's cold out, I'll throw his coat or jacket in the dryer for a few minutes to make sure he's nice and toasty, get his morning coffee ready in a thermos and a quick homemade breakfast like biscuits and gravy or protein pancakes with banana slices and chocolate chips so he can feel full until lunch, sigh it's the dream. Not to mention when he gets home from work, having dinner ready like my grandma's recipe for homemade chicken and dumplings or my secret recipe for pot roast with blackberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream for dessert. Having him settle on the couch and relax while I clean up the kitchen and load the dishwasher, coaxing him to get in the shower so he can clean off all the grime from the day and throwing the towel in the dryer so it's nice and warm for when he gets out. Then having him put his head in my lap while we watch tv in the living room so I can play with hair or scratch his back. Just the little things honestly🥹 I wanna accompany my guy with his hobbies even if I'm not into it myself, be a presence and help where I can, when it's time to unwind, watch him mess around in the shop/garage or watch some TV together, me reading or writing while he's doing his own thing just enjoying each other's company, ending the night with cuddles as he falls asleep while I scratch his back, knowing tomorrow will be the same thing all over again

Always ask if the worker talks your language. Most of us just know the necessary for work, like ""coffee, milk, tea, té, manzanilla, marmelada, ..."", so if I want something more specific, be sure that we talk your language.

Anyone else? ,"9 weeks and feeling nauseas/sick on and off. We went to a bunch of family gatherings this week and I mustered through all of them. We have one more tomorrow, but I really don’t want to go but husband does. Is it ok if I skip out? 

Debating sending him with our kids if he feels so inclined to go, but it’s going to be mostly toddlers there and I’m also afraid of picking something up. Currently, my kids are not in school and home with me so I can be a little more cautious during cold/flu season. Obviously we did go to a few family gatherings this week and I felt comfortable with that risk, but I feel like I’m tapped out socially right now. I think once I hopefully make it through the second trimester I won’t feel the need to be so cautious. 

My anxiety is really bad about getting through the first trimester as healthy as possible. I am cramping a bit tonight so I’m gonna call the dr in the morning, but I just feel like I’m in an anxious headspace and want to take care of myself tomorrow. I know I shouldn’t hold my family hostage to my anxiety but I just wish I felt supported by my husband right now and feel like I had the “OK” to skip tomorrow. It’s not like it’s going to ruin anyone’s plans. And - I also am not ready to tell this group of people tomorrow that I’m pregnant and I have no idea how I’m going to hide it between gagging, having a bump, and not drinking alcohol or coffee. 

I know not everyone is worried about germs and that’s totally cool - but am I being a horrible mom/wife if I just want us to chill and not go? We’ve had a busy week. Like I said - I can always have my husband take the kids and I’ll stay home if that’s the best compromise. ",1,1735518429.0,CautiousBB,0,1.0,False

Hello Lovelies! My name is Star, 27f, need big sister advice on how to handle my hopefully not deluluness. I'm a follower of thos channel snd i put the pod on during work, so i think my post may be fitting! So grab a cup and read on! 

To give background, I've been working at my current job for about two years. Ryan, 42m, as far as I know, started about a year ago. We both work in different departments in our buidling, but our offices interact regularly. Thinking back, the first time we offically met was in the parking lot on the way into work. I believe it was his first day and he needed guidance on where to go and we happened to cross paths. Helping him out, I noticed during our conversatjon, there is this kindness about him that felt open and friendly. It felt flowy. [Does that make sense??]. Over the next few months, whenever we would rarely see or speak to each other, much of the same banter and attraction was there between us. I started noticing that he'd asked my opionons in an office debate with his group of coworker; keeping me updated about things in our town; and checking to make sure I didn't have trouble falling asleep once I went home after brutal shifts. He would maintain eye contact with me, laughed along to my comedic jokes, that showed he was paying attention during conversation. BUT due to our work being annoyingly busy, the convos were professional and light. 

In the recent weeks, we started engaging with each other more due to staff vacations. ne of my job duties is to gain report at the . When I called, he answered promptly with this subtle flirty way that leaves my cheeks hot! 

So, getting to the good part.

Recently, about 3 days ago, it was Christmas. I wasn't scheduled to work that day. Messages of well wishes were going around, and I had sent the general celebrations to my other coworkers through our company app groupchat, but for his I private messaged him with a well wishes. He messaged me back with added well wishes. 

[Of course, me being me], my extra bold and sexy alter ego says send him this and I obviously listened..] 
Me: ""Oh, I meant to give you this before, [insert my number] if you  want to use it for that project we will be working together on next year."" 
Him: ""Beat me to it. 😏"" 

2 MINUTES LATER I GET A TEXT!


For SOME reason I get all these butterflies and I'm NERVOUSS and all the man said texted: ""Hey, it's Ryan."" Here's how the text convo goes.

Him: ""Hey, it’s Ryan.""
Me: ""Hi Ryan, sleepy yet?""
Him: ""I'm very sleepy! I didn't adequately prepare today for the shift.""
Me: ""Oh no! I believe in you! Any tricks you like to do to help keep yourself up?""
Him: ""I usually walk the halls of the office will open the door to the cold outside for a blast of air. OR listen to music that I don't like and it makes my brain have to think and stay alert lol""
Me: ""That's pretty smart and maybe i should adopt some of the things! It's really hard for me not to give in to the coffee temptation, so I'll bother my friend with a phone call or try to catch up on shows I've been putting off lol 😆""
Him: ""I'm a sucker for coffee every time myself but then I find it keeps me up if I drink it too late into the shift.""
Me: ""Ugh same! Or it'll make me even more sleepy, so I definitely have to find a new way to stay up lol. / But I will say that you're more than welcome to come my direction.  I have the good coffee or if you want the company. 😄""
Him: ""Oh, I'll have to come that way for sure for both reasons! Hopefully, it'll be on a not so busy. I like that offer!""
Me: ""Well I look forward to when 🤭.""

So, I fall asleep at this point and the next shift, I go in to work. At some point in the shift, I call over to my friends line for updates on a client and because why not, it just so happens, he would answer instead. [INSERT INTERNAL GIRL SCREAM!] Here is the phone call as followed.

Him: ""Blah blah blah department, this Ryan.""
Me: ""Hello, Ryan. It's Star. How are you?"" 
Him: ""Oh hey! I'm glad you're working today! I'm doing good. How are you doing?"" 
[INSERT ANOTHER INTERNAL SCREAM BY HOW GENIUINE EXCITED HE SOUNDED WHEN HE SAID THAT!!!]
Me laughing: ""Well thank you for the warm welcome!""
We proceed exchange how we are doing and then  go on to give report. He then said this.
He: ""'l'll be on my way to drop off something for another department, I might need to stop by for that coffee.""
[INTERNALLY WONDERING IF HE WANTS TO SEE ME ???]
Me: ""Well how do you like your coffee?""
He tells me and I laugh, before another call comes through and I have to hang up. We say goodbye and work starts getting hectic because again, why not?

30 minutes later I get a text...

Him: ""I'll be by in 5 minutes.""
[IS THAT TEXT NOT HOT???]
Me: ""Perfect timing! The pot just started 😋.""
[internally starts to overthink that was a WAY to obvious a flirty emoji]
Me: ""Sounds good! My door may be closed, but just knock! (:
Him: ""I shall :))

TRUE TO HIS WORD, I hear a knock on my office door and GIRL my heart BEATED! [Perfume might have been sprayed. I'm WEIRD]

*door opens*
Me: ""Hello, Ryan.""
Him: "" Hello, nice to see you again. you look lovely.""
[NEED I SCREAM MORE? YES! THIS NOT IN THE SCENARIO!!]
Me: ""Nice to see you as well, blue looks good on you.""
[HE SMILED!!]
I see him notice the freshly poured cofee and we then sat opposite of side of each other. The conversation flowed easy. It felt like we were old friends, but it felt new. And for some reason because I'm me, I asked if he had kids or was married. [🙃!] 

Him (shyly, but smiling): ""I do have kids and I'm divorced.""
He opens up here about some personal stuff that I won't write here, but its good natured and he seems healed! (I not used to healed men 👀), but when I tell you I felt an intimate switch flip between us as the convo gets more personal. During this entire time, I'm picking up on cues that his body language was open and toward me. He maintained eye contact and matched the rhythm of the conversation; and best of all, he laughed at my wonderful and amazing jokes. [PINCH ME] 

At some point, 10 minutes have passed and he gets a text about a client. He thanks me for the coffee, before turning to head out of the doorwa; he turns to me., [YALL I THINK FOR A SECOND THIS MAN WANTS TO KISS ME THE WAY HES LOOKING AT ME!!!!] He says: ""It was nice to see you again and may stop see you again."" "" [BESTIE PINCH MEEE!!] We wave bye, and he leaves.

47 minutes later, I get a text!
Him: ""Thank you for the ☕️ and the chat! You looked lovely, too!""
Me: ""Hehee well thank you kindly for sparing the time with me and for the compliment. Don't be a stranger 😋""
[What's the vote on this emoji friends? 😮‍💨]
Him: ""I won't be a stranger!""
Me: ""Also I like your color coordination by the way.""
Him: ""I love how serene and chill your office space is. [MESSAGES CAME IN AT THE SAME TIME]
Me: ""Thank you! It's my little hideout that you're more than welcome to hide out with me whenever you get a chance away haha 😄""
Him: ""I'd hideout with you any day!""
Me: ""Hmmm so should I mark out my calendar for later tonight?""
Him: ""Its a date! 🤓""
[I might have reread that twiceamillion]
Me: ""See you then!""

An hour later, I hear a knock on my door. [For weird reasons unknown, I wanted to prance??? I didn't...] I open the door and he says before entering: ""Nice to see you again."" [ORGAz- anyways being demure] we sit and chat. Eye contact the whole time before he gets a department call and has to head back. [BOO, but did I mention we chatted for 20 minutes??]

Anyways, before he leaves, AGAIN this man turns in the doorway and looks me in my EYEBALLS and says he might if he has time come and see me again before the end of shift. [I'M DECEASED!]

UNFORTUNATELY, it getting close to the end of our shift and work wanted to be work and get busy again. (I promise I do love my job, but girl I was tireddd)

Its finally the end of shift; wig metaphorically taken off, my phone buzzes. I see it's from him. 

Him: ""I'm a big fan of that coffee and of you.""
[DECEASED TIMES TWOO!!]
Me: ""Glad to know you have great. 🤭""
Him: ""Haha. I'll check in eith you on new years!""

So after all that typing, my concerns are: 

1. So yes, the age is there; is it possible to relate? 
2. ...I feel like answer is obvious, but do we vote that he's flirting with me or that I'm delulu? 
3. Should I make a move or should he? There's a bit of promise and hesitation, but I don't want to ruin any coworkers relationship. BUT I really like talking to him.
4. For anyone who's had experience in this situation, please share your stories!

Hello Lovelies! My name is Star, 27f, need big sister advice on how to handle my hopefully not deluluness. I'm a follower of thos channel snd i put the pod on during work, so i think my post may be fitting! So grab a cup and read on! 

To give background, I've been working at my current job for about two years. Ryan, 42m, as far as I know, started about a year ago. We both work in different departments in our buidling, but our offices interact regularly. Thinking back, the first time we offically met was in the parking lot on the way into work. I believe it was his first day and he needed guidance on where to go and we happened to cross paths. Helping him out, I noticed during our conversatjon, there is this kindness about him that felt open and friendly. It felt flowy. [Does that make sense??]. Over the next few months, whenever we would rarely see or speak to each other, much of the same banter and attraction was there between us. I started noticing that he'd asked my opionons in an office debate with his group of coworker; keeping me updated about things in our town; and checking to make sure I didn't have trouble falling asleep once I went home after brutal shifts. He would maintain eye contact with me, laughed along to my comedic jokes, that showed he was paying attention during conversation. BUT due to our work being annoyingly busy, the convos were professional and light. 

In the recent weeks, we started engaging with each other more due to staff vacations. ne of my job duties is to gain report at the . When I called, he answered promptly with this subtle flirty way that leaves my cheeks hot! 

So, getting to the good part.

Recently, about 3 days ago, it was Christmas. I wasn't scheduled to work that day. Messages of well wishes were going around, and I had sent the general celebrations to my other coworkers through our company app groupchat, but for his I private messaged him with a well wishes. He messaged me back with added well wishes. 

[Of course, me being me], my extra bold and sexy alter ego says send him this and I obviously listened..] 
Me: ""Oh, I meant to give you this before, [insert my number] if you  want to use it for that project we will be working together on next year."" 
Him: ""Beat me to it. 😏"" 

2 MINUTES LATER I GET A TEXT!


For SOME reason I get all these butterflies and I'm NERVOUSS and all the man said texted: ""Hey, it's Ryan."" Here's how the text convo goes.

Him: ""Hey, it’s Ryan.""
Me: ""Hi Ryan, sleepy yet?""
Him: ""I'm very sleepy! I didn't adequately prepare today for the shift.""
Me: ""Oh no! I believe in you! Any tricks you like to do to help keep yourself up?""
Him: ""I usually walk the halls of the office will open the door to the cold outside for a blast of air. OR listen to music that I don't like and it makes my brain have to think and stay alert lol""
Me: ""That's pretty smart and maybe i should adopt some of the things! It's really hard for me not to give in to the coffee temptation, so I'll bother my friend with a phone call or try to catch up on shows I've been putting off lol 😆""
Him: ""I'm a sucker for coffee every time myself but then I find it keeps me up if I drink it too late into the shift.""
Me: ""Ugh same! Or it'll make me even more sleepy, so I definitely have to find a new way to stay up lol. / But I will say that you're more than welcome to come my direction.  I have the good coffee or if you want the company. 😄""
Him: ""Oh, I'll have to come that way for sure for both reasons! Hopefully, it'll be on a not so busy. I like that offer!""
Me: ""Well I look forward to when 🤭.""

So, I fall asleep at this point and the next shift, I go in to work. At some point in the shift, I call over to my friends line for updates on a client and because why not, it just so happens, he would answer instead. [INSERT INTERNAL GIRL SCREAM!] Here is the phone call as followed.

Him: ""Blah blah blah department, this Ryan.""
Me: ""Hello, Ryan. It's Star. How are you?"" 
Him: ""Oh hey! I'm glad you're working today! I'm doing good. How are you doing?""

1hpa66t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hpa66t/i_m26_dated_a_f27_with_bpd_only_for_her_to_let/,I (M26) dated a (F27) with BPD only for her to let their ex move back in with them:,"This is a long story about a predicament I found myself in. 

I (M 26) matched on POF with this woman (F 27) back in August and we messaged for a few weeks before we finally met one another (she lives an hour and half plus from me so this was long distance). That initial hang out was great and I had the time of my life and being in her company. At one point though, she told me she loved me. Now, in the past I have had people tell me they love me early on and then cheat on/ghost me so I put my walls up because I wasn’t sure how to respond. 

We continued talking through September and she was upset that I wouldn’t say “I love you” back even though we continued to hang out and spend time with one another. I just told her that I had been hurt in the past and I wasn’t ready for that yet even though I did feel strongly for her. I wanted to take things slowly and she said she was wanting a relationship with me and I told her I did too but I wanted to wait still.

It continued to be like this until we were being intimate at the beginning of October and that was when she asked me, “why don’t you love me?” Hearing that broke my heart and I told her I do love her and that I want to be with her. Once we were together, everything was pretty great.

We had a couple of arguments at some point. The first being over a tiramisu cake she got from Walmart. She was excited to eat it and after helping her unload her groceries at the house and spending time with her I had left so she had it that night. 

The next day, I was making conversation and asking her how it was and she said it was good. I simply asked “did you eat all of it?” and she blows up on me and goes “No, what the fuck? Why would you ask me that? You know how I am about food. Talking about food with me is a fucking privilege.” and she hung up on me and did not talk to me for a few hours until she had calmed down. I get she was weird about food and eating in front of people and talking about food but like, I just asked a simple question. She didn’t have to blow up on me like that.

The second was whenever I was at work and she was like “I’m pissed at you”. I asked her why and she wouldn’t elaborate. When I went to break I called her and she screamed at me about messaging her friend on Snapchat. All I had done was send a picture with no message with a goofy filter on it and kept our daily streak alive. I also had asked questions about her to her friend so I could learn more about her and surprise her with stuff in the future. She told me “that is my fucking friend and you do not talk to her. That’s fucking weird and it’s annoying that I’ve had to tell you this multiple times.” In reality, she never expressed that this was a problem. I didn’t realize it was affecting her as such until she screamed at me about it. 

I apologized and deleted her friend off of Snapchat. She was still angry at me and told me that she didn’t like me asking a lot of questions because it felt like she was being interrogated. Any time I would ask her questions like “how was your day?”, “what are you up to?”, “got any plans?”, she got annoyed and irritated by it. In her own words “it’s tiring and annoying I have to explain everything I do throughout the day.” (I never told her to explain EVERYTHING, I just wanted to know how her day was going, there was a difference). Regardless of these things, everything seemed to blow over after a bit. 

That is, until her ex broke into her house.

You see, her ex took the spare key from under her mat and stole dog food from her garage (from a dog that he forgot to consistently feed and died from malnourishment) and then canned foods from her house. She told me she was going to press charges and her friend and I encouraged her to do it but ultimately she never did. The ex did come back and returned the key he took. She and him ended up talking about things and he said he wanted to see their kids again (they are 2 years old and 8 months old). 

The ex himself is a piece of work. He’s a serial cheater (one of the girls being underage), he is an alcoholic, constantly smokes, is unemployed, and is homeless (his dad pays for his hotel room and bought a motorcycle for him). While this woman and I were together, she would let me know about him and what he was doing/how long he was there for at all times. It started off as a couple of hours, then it was all afternoon, then it was until dinner time, then it was until she kicked him out, then he started spending the night.

She then told me her ex was living with her to help co-parent the kids after this had been happening for a while and a couple of weeks ago she broke up with me. She told me, “I know you had a lot of issues with your father growing up and him not being there for you so I expect you to understand why this needs to happen.” I did understand even if it did make me uncomfortable and confused as to why she was letting him back in after all these horrible things he’s done to her and to others.

She broke up with me and told me that her reasoning was that she had a lot of things going on over on her end and she needed space to process her thoughts and feelings. She told me she loved me and that she would always be here for me. I told her the same thing and that was that.

Or so I thought…

After we broke up, she called me on the phone the next day. She told me that she woke up to see her ex was in her bed. She swore nothing happened and that there was a pillow in between them.

She also insisted that she wanted me to come over for Thanksgiving to meet her kids for the first time and see her family. I was excited to do this but I thought it was going to be weird to do that if we weren’t together. 

I told her that I couldn’t pretend that everything was alright on a holiday like that and she got upset with me. She asked me, “why can’t you just play pretend?” to which I responded with, “because I can’t fake my emotions”. 

She told me she was just going to tell her parents I was having car troubles and that I couldn’t make it up there because she doesn’t want her parents knowing that her ex is living with her again. She told me “if you do not come up here for Thanksgiving then we are done.” 

I told her I couldn’t do it and she hung up. She told me she was unadding me on all social media to which I responded “okay, I understand” every time she texted me saying she was removing me from something. 

I ignored her for a couple of hours and then she texted me and profusely apologized for how she was and said it wasn’t okay for her to do what she did. I told her, “I understand, you have had a lot go on in your life as of late and it’s affecting you.” 

We seemingly got through that rough patch and we still texted a lot and we still were sexting (which she was instigating with flirting and texts). 

It wasn’t until the next week whenever she was going through a depressive episode and she wanted me to come over there and have sex with her in the early hours of the morning that things went cold between us.

I told her I couldn’t go over there because I had work in the morning (and also her ex is living under the same roof as her so that’s weird) and then she said “I miss you but this is exactly why I don’t fucking do long distance”. 

I called her after I got that message and we talked about what we could do to improve and fix our relationship. She originally told me that she still needs to figure things out on her end and her own feelings but she also said a contributing factor to us breaking up is that I was so hesitant to meet her kids.

Now, I’ve never done something like that before. I know her kids are young and that they wouldn’t really remember me if I messed things up or whatever but I still wanted to impress this woman and make a good first impression with her in regard to her kids. I explained this and she still said it was a “red flag” to her. 

Then she also said it was the distance between us and that with us being so far apart she has to constantly explain to me what’s going on in her life and she doesn’t want to do that. She wants her person to be there with her and she told me that if I was closer things could have been different.

Ever since that night she’s been one wording me and leaving me on read for hours when she used to text me back almost immediately all the time.

My Grandpa has been in the hospital and his health has been rapidly declining. I tried telling that to her and she told me, “I do understand you're going through something rn. I do... trust me. But like... im not the one for this conversation. I have tried to be here for you the last couple days but I feel like I'm becoming a therapist. Not able to work through my own feelings and my own shit without having to walk you through yours. I get it this is a tough time for you... but maybe talk to someone else...”

I didn’t message her until she reached out and then again, it was brief and one sided with me asking all the questions and not her asking anything about me. She snapchatted me on Sunday while I was out at the hospital and when I didn’t message her within a couple of hours she texted me and said “noted”. 

I told her I was at the hospital and what was going on with my grandpa and this time she told me that she had him, me, and my family in her thoughts and that I could call her later.

Since then we have talked on the phone a couple of times. 

Once was on December 9th and all of it was going well until she started spamming me goofy pictures of her ex and she was laughing about it and saying how weird he is and how funny it all was. It made me uncomfortable but I just went along with it because I was enjoying talking to her.

The second time was on December 12th. It was good until she started talking about a guy from high school who is now her sugar daddy and he’s paying for her nipple piercings. 

Then she talked about her friend Skylar (a guy she matched with on Tinder years ago and they’ve been friends ever since) about him being a virgin and him signing up to pose as a nude model for an art project and how he has a lack of self confidence. She also mentioned him a few days after we broke up and that she was supposed to meet him half way (he lives in Belleville) for coffee but “forgot” about it so never did. This is particularly funny because she told me she wasn’t really comfortable with being far away from her kids in case they needed her (which I thought was understandable) but she wouldn’t travel to see me but would travel to see him? Suspicious.

Afterwards, she talked about how her friend is moving in and the ground rules she laid down about her friend and her ex better not be having sex under her roof. She was telling me she told her other friend that if she caught them having sex in her house she would kill them and that she could steal the guy that her one friend is talking to if she wanted to and she was laughing about it.

She was telling me she told her other friend that if she caught them having sex in her house she would kill them and that she could steal the guy that her one friend is talking to if she wanted to and she was laughing about it. 

In this same phone call she mentioned how stupid her friend was for pushing a guy that was treating her nicely and kindly away for a guy that was abusive and treating her like garbage. She said “I know I’m the pot calling the kettle black because I have my ex living here with me but…” and I just shut down because I didn’t know what to say. She is self-aware of the situation and is putting her friend down for making the same exact choice that she made.

Now, she insists that she and her ex aren’t sleeping together and I want to believe it but there’s just so many things that don’t add up.

I texted her December 12th after her messaging me the past couple of days first and then leaving me on read all day. This is the following conversation:

Me: “Do you still want to talk?”

Her: “Huh”

Me: “Everything has felt off between us for the past few days. I just wasn’t sure what was going on or if you were still wanting to talk.”

Her: “Okay well 🤷‍♀️”

Me: “Well what?”

Her: “Idk”

*I leave her on read for like 5 minutes before she responds again*

Her: “Every time you message me you always have negative shit to say. I know you’re going through a lot bc so am I but goddamn”

Me: “But I haven’t said anything negative other than what was going on in my life briefly with my Grandpa and even then I’ve tried to make light of it. I haven’t even really talked to you in like 2 days either. You’ve reached out to me and when I reach back out you have left me on read.”

Her: “Lol okay”

Me: “I’m just telling you. You’ve messaged me twice across two days and both times I responded with “hey what’s up?” Or “what are you up to?” you left me on open. When I talked about what was going on with me when we were texting I either mentioned “Oh I’m just making my food bc I haven’t eaten since Saturday” or “My grandpa isn’t doing the best but he did make me laugh”.”

Her: “And I guess that’s how you see it”

Me: “How do you see it? Based on what has been going on that is the information I’ve been presented with.”

Her: “I haven't texted you the last 2 days much yeah. But yeah ""I haven't been eating"" ""im so tired"" ""been in my head"" that's when I leave you alone. I pretty much stopped responded when i feel like I have to respond with ""im sorry"" or have to ask you what else is going on. So you see it as im not responding but I see it as im not exhausting myself to try to make you feel better.”

Me: “I never said I was in my head. I told you I hadn’t been eating bc of everything going on with my grandpa and that I was finally eating. I told you I had been napping most of the day on Monday bc I was tired. I’m not asking you to make me feel better as I’ve been taking steps to improve myself with working out and eating healthier which I’ve told you about. You reached out to me and I responded with “hey what’s up?” Or “what’s going on?” The past couple of days and nothing. I was trying to engage in conversation but you left me on read.”

Her: “Okay”

Me: “I’m going to go. I wish you nothing but the best. Have a good life, *redacted*.”
*Blocks her*

I legitimately don’t get it. How does someone go from “I love you and I will always be here for you” to this? I just felt like I messed up and that I did something wrong but at the same time, I don’t even know what I could have done wrong other than care way too much about what was going on with her. 

She went from texting me all the time from “Good morning” texts to “Goodnight I love you.” to leaving me on read for hours and giving me one word or brief responses at most. She never asks any questions about me, I always have to ask her questions about her or her day to get even the faintest bit of conversation going. I just don’t understand.

I feel as though I’ve made the right decision in blocking this person, but I also can’t help but feel like I also overreacted. Did I? I just want my mental and physical health to improve and for all parties involved to be happy.

We broke up a few weeks ago, stopped talking completely a week ago, and it still hurts no matter what I do to try and take the pain away.",1,1735518133.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False
1hpa4rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hpa4rl/th_unkindness_eve/,[TH] Unkindness Eve,"High above the snow-covered city streets, in a tall and luxurious corporate building, inside a fancy office lined with bookshelves containing all matters of economic books, a rather uncomfortable conversation unfolded.

“I’m sorry Elias, but we’ll have to let you go. I don’t mean to start your new year off like this, but the company just can’t handle the amount of personnel currently on staff,” the well-dressed businessman seated at the other end of the expensive table said. 

“Are you kidding me? It’s Christmas Eve! You couldn’t have at least given me my bonus on the way out? 7 years with the company and I got put on the chopping block? Why me?” Elias countered, completely flustered by this news. He had come into his boss’ office expecting good news for the holidays, an increase in salary, a promotion, hell even a bigger bonus. Being laid off had certainly not been on his list of possibilities.

“Due to your decreased performance this year compared to some of your peers, our calculations unfortunately placed you in the unfavorable zone. There’s nothing we can do now, all of your paperwork has been completed and the books have been updated. I truly am sorry Elias,” his boss mumbled while twirling a pen between his fingers, refusing to make eye contact with his ex-employee. This fact made Elias even more furious.

“Your calculations? My son was sick this year and I had three family members pass away, my apologies for taking leave and not being in the office as much as these fresh college grads with nothing better to do. Matter of fact, I’ll go to my dead family members’ graves and tell them they got me fired right before Christmas, that’ll show ‘em,” Elias spat, growing more furious with every word that rushed out of his lips. Elias’ boss still did not meet his gaze and the pen spinning speed had increased tenfold. No more words were uttered, Elias was merely shown the door, and given an hour to retrieve his belongings. No one else was in the office, as Elias had been the last of the meetings for the day. 

If he had known that everyone before him was getting fired, he would have come in earlier to say goodbye. No, the company couldn’t even afford him that. The elevator made its familiar *DING* as he stepped in, holding his box of staplers, pens, and paper. A few picture frames broke up the office supply monotony, as well as a toy dinosaur Elias’ son had made him in school.

Another *DING* signaled the end of the elevator’s trip down to the ground floor, and the final moments of his time at the office. The foyer was barren, with the only exception being the desk clerk who unsurprisingly would also not make eye contact with him. Elias pushed through the heavy doors and started down the marble steps, immediately regretting his decision not to wear a scarf and heavy coat. The wind was biting every square inch of exposed skin, and burrowing underneath his clothing. 

“Wonderful,” Elias muttered to himself as the walk home began. Luckily for him, the walk was rather short and he only had to endure the cold for a maximum of 10 minutes. He looked up to see the towering skyscrapers covered with snow, their countless windows pouring light into the flurry of flakes that descended from the sky. It seemed Christmas was trying to lighten his mood, and for a moment, he let it. The decorations of every street lamp, the smell of homemade food, and the constant chatter of people enjoying themselves in the snow brought to Elias a memory of a much simpler time, when he had a job, a wife, and a newborn son. That memory stayed with him for the entire walk home but quickly faded as he approached his door. 

The narrow street that Elias lived on was not like the bigger roads that made up the center of the city. These kinds of streets were filled with the smell of poverty, the chatter of druggies, and the sights of filth. The snow was trying its best to conceal the less desirable parts of Elias’ streets, but he knew what lay underneath the thin winter blanket. His door matched the rest of the house, boringly brown and weathered. The sole front window to the right of it had a single candle, unlit, and drapes that had been there since the last owner. The upstairs windows looked the same, not a Christmas decoration in sight. 

Placing his cardboard box of belongings on the topmost step, Elias fumbled in his pocket for his keys. Finally finding them, as his key hit his lock, a familiar voice called to him.

“That box better not be all you’re preparing for the storm Elias!” An older woman shrieked from across the street. The old hag was named Margarette, or Marg for short, and was always in the business of everyone else on the street.

“Nope, just got fired actually, thanks Marg,” Elias defeatedly retorted. He did not want to entertain Marg or any of her banter.

“On Christmas Eve? Well, tell them that I’m gonna come down there and give them a piece of my mind!” She yelled, even louder than before. 

“I’m sure that they’re very afraid and will take me back immediately,” Elias said, opening his door and kicking his melancholy box inside.

“Your sarcasm doesn’t cut me, young man. Hey Elias,” Marg said this time in a softer tone.

“Yes, Margarette?” Elias responded.

“Try to have a Merry Christmas alright?” She said, not in her usual nosy or cutting tone. The same spark ignited in his chest that burned when he saw the town square, if only for a moment. 

“You too Marg, you too,” Elias said quietly while ducking his head and stepping into his home. The door shut behind him, blocking him from the frigid hold of the air outside. His home was dark, the ambiance not being aided by the rapidly darkening sky outside, a detail Elias failed to notice. He flicked on the living room light, then the kitchen. His living room wasn’t as bare as some of the other bachelor pads, with a couch, love seat, coffee table, TV, and numerous plants and pieces of artwork that lined the walls. Elias wished he could take credit for how good the apartment looked, but it was all his ex-wife Sam’s doing. 

Sam and Elias had separated almost two years ago, with Sam having more custody over their son Max than Elias would have liked. To make the blow softer, Sam had left most of the apartment intact when she moved out with Max. Now looking back, Elias wished she would have just taken it all. The process was a hard one, trying to raise the same kid separately, but they were making it work. Elias had already gotten to have some time with Max earlier that week, which he had cherished, but it ate at him that for the second year in a row, he would spending Christmas alone. This time, jobless to compound onto it.

Elias changed into some more comfortable clothing and plopped down on the couch, beginning an attempt at Marg’s suggestion. He flipped the TV on and settled into the indent that had been formed over the years of him sitting on the couch. Soon the weight of the day tugged on his eyelids, and sleep quickly overtook him.

*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*

A series of loud knocks jostled Elias awake making him nearly fall off of the couch. He quickly glanced at his phone to check the time, 11:26pm. 

“Who could be knocking this late?” Elias thought to himself as he threw on a robe and padded to the door. He leaned close to the peephole and was met with the sight of a small, shivering girl outside. Elias unlocked the door and pulled it open, but was assisted rather forcefully by the gusts of wind. Feeling how much pressure the wind had put on the door Elias was surprised the girl hadn’t been blown to the next borough.“Hey hun, come inside it’s freezing out there,” Elias said hurrying the girl inside. The stranger immediately obliged, hurrying past him.

“Thank you so so much. You were the first door I tried and I’m so glad you were the only one I had to knock on,” the girl said. She was indeed small, 5’2” on a good day. Blonde hair swung over one shoulder, and her big puffy coat was covered in a thick layer of snow that concealed a thin layer of ice forming. Her face was flushed red and her hands shook uncontrollably. She was wearing jeans and furry boots, with a festive sweater underneath her coat. The girl had to have been 15 at most, which worried Elias. Her features were a stark contrast to his brown hair green eyes and large frame. The only thing that they had in common was the festive garments they were wearing, Elias, having chosen the Christmas tree robe to answer the door that matched the girl’s sweater.

“I’m glad that I answered. Where are your parents?” Elias asked full of concern.

“We were at a parade, but with the storm, it got canceled. Really short notice too, everyone was running everywhere. I lost them in the crowd, I just started wandering,” the girl replied, chilled tears forming in her eyes.  


“Whoa whoa ok slow down, how long were you out there alone?” Elias said, now worried about the girl’s health.

“About an hour, I searched everywhere but I couldn’t find them. The snow got so thick but I was scared and thought if I tried they would at least be out there to find me,” the girl replied, now sobbing every fourth or fifth word. 

“Alright, well get warm and we’ll call the police to come get you. I assume you don’t have a phone or you would have called,” Elias said both to her and himself, trying to figure out the best way to help the girl.

“No I don’t, that would make my life so much easier,” the girl replied.

“Strict parents huh?” Elias said while placing a fresh cup of hot cocoa on the coffee table for her.

“Very.” The girl chuckled, taking the cup in her hands to warm them up.

“I know the feeling. I’m Elias by the way. What’s your name so I can give the police some more details,” Elias said while sitting on the loveseat across from the couch, allowing the shivering girl all the space she needed.

“Lila,” she replied through sips of her hot cocoa. She still had not removed her jacket, but the shivers had almost completely stopped.

“Well Lila, I’m going to call the police and get them the information and they’ll take you, they’re much better equipped to deal with this situation. Wouldn’t want your Christmas Eve to be all the way ruined,” Elias chuckled. Lila’s face didn’t light up, and her mouth tightened. 

“Could you not do that?” Lila said shakily. Elias threw a curious glance her way.

“Why do you not want me to call the police?” Elias concernedly responded.

“Look I don’t want to give you all the details but I’m in trouble with the police right now for something I didn’t do. Please Mr. Elias if I could stay with you tonight until the storm passes then in the morning I can go look for my parents I would appreciate it. If that’s too much to ask I understand but I really don’t want to have to go back out there or deal with the cops,” Lila said. Elias was stunned and had not the slightest clue what to do moving forward.

He definitely did not want to house a child that was not his for longer than he had to, but Lila’s story made him think of Max and what he would do for him. Elias sat there for a long moment, fingers rubbing his temples, trying to sort out the mess of thoughts in his head.

“Mr. Elias?” Lila softly spoke, snapping him out of his trance.

“Yeah, sorry hun, sure you can stay. You can have the couch, I’ll be upstairs if you need anything. Snacks are in the fridge and the cabinets, help yourself. If it’s all the same to you, I’m gonna head in for the night. It’s late and I’ve had a rather sh-, crappy day. Although I know you know the feeling. Good night,” Elias said as he shambled up the stairs.

“Goodnight Mr. Elias, Merry Christmas,” Lila replied, snuggling into the couch and grabbing a blanket that was hanging off the back.

The upstairs of the apartment was decorated the same way as the downstairs, with the bedroom being no exception. With the completion of his nightly routine, Elias flopped into bed and let sleep once again take hold of him. He had a dreamless sleep, which he was thankful for. His rest was cut short by his body screaming for water. Since there was no water by the bed he slowly rose to get ice water from downstairs. Elias’ footsteps seemed louder now that he was trying to keep quiet, to not wake Lila.

Reaching the top of the stairs he realized, however, that Lila was far from asleep. So much so that she was talking. Elias raised an eyebrow and leaned towards the banister to hear what the girl was talking about.

“Yeah, mhm, yeah he let me right in. Uh-huh, nah I think he’s asleep, I gave it some time, uh huh.” Elias’ stomach sank like a rock. Lila had told him she didn’t have a phone, and his was tucked in his pocket. Something immediately felt very off about his current situation, and Elias was cursing himself for not calling the police to come retrieve the girl. That’s what he was going to do now though, and he reached for his phone in his pocket. As he slid open the screen and punched in the numbers, he noticed that Lila’s chatter had stopped downstairs. Elias looked up from his phone screen, down the stairs, straight at the barrel of a gun.

“Yeahhh probably should have called the police. The best part is, I didn’t even lie to you about that part. Spending Christmas Eve behind bars would have sucked,” Lila purred.

“No parade, or parents I’m assuming then?” Elias spat back, putting his hand above his head. 

“Nah, long dead, buncha addicts. But hey, they gave me something that no one else in the world could have given me, resilience. I thank ‘em for that, everything else they can piss right off. Now then, walk me through the house and show me all your valuables, and I won’t shoot you like the last guy. I don’t wanna become a double murderer,” Lila said calmly and flatly while motioning for Elias to come down the stairs.

“You shot the last guy?” Elias said half alarmed, half unsure if the girl was bluffing. He moved down the stairs slowly, more to get a better look at the weapon and its authenticity than not to startle the girl.

“Big dude thought that being big would stop him from getting shot before he put his hands on me. Mistake. Where to first?” Lila asked, deadpanned and lifeless. Elias reached the bottom of the stairs, hands still above his head, making sure to keep his phone screen away from Lila.

“Is that even your real name? Lila? I assume you’re just gonna shoot me anyway since I’ve already seen your face, I at least wanna know who you are,” Elias said as collected as he could, now seeing as he passed that the gun was real, with the serial scratched off.

“That I also didn’t lie about, and you’ve given me a really good idea. You being the second person I’ve done this to and all, it’s a learning process. Who knows, maybe I shoot you, maybe I won’t. We’ll see where the night takes us Mr. Elias,” Lila cooed. Elias took her to the safe that was behind one of the pieces of art and stopped. The safe could be opened and closed through an app on his phone, and since the safe’s hinges were relatively new, the door swung with force. This lesson he had learned the first time he stood to open it.

“Can I look at the safe app on my phone? I’ll need it to open it,” Elias said, now more confident.

“Sure thing,” Lila said with the barrel of the gun never leaving Elias’ forehead. Elias brought the phone down, making sure to conceal the ongoing call on the top of the screen from Lila’s vision. 

“You’re gonna have to get close to the safe, it’s gonna take a scan of your eye. Once it beeps I’ll press this button and it’ll open,” Elias said convincingly. Lila shot him a wary glance, then slowly walked over to the safe, placing her eye where a tiny screen was. The gun still pointing at Elias, she gave him a sideways look.

“Alright, almost there,” Elias said, before pressing the open button and slamming the safe door directly on the bridge of Lila’s nose. Spots of red blood dotted the floor and Elias ducked just in time to avoid the bullet that whizzed over his head.

“UGH!” Lila yelled, grasping her face and taking her eyes off Elias. Seizing the opportunity Elias managed to wrestle the gun out of Lila’s hands and point it at her.

“Go…sit down…” Elias sternly said between labored breaths. He unclicked the silent mode on his phone, allowing Lila to hear the call.

“You got all that officer?” Elias asked the phone.

I usually woke up before her to start the coffee maker, moving quietly in the dark as if that would soften my presence. I knew she was waiting for me to wake her, and I loved being the first part of her day. It meant everything to me that she always wanted to begin her mornings in my arms.

We’d stand in the kitchen, the lights still off, watching the sun rise as we talked—sometimes softly, sometimes about nothing in particular—right up until the last seconds before I had to leave for work. The thought of continuing those conversations carried me through the monotony of my day, right until I pulled back into the driveway. I’d switch off my headlights, just in case she’d fallen asleep on the couch waiting for me to come home.

When I came through the door, she would greet me with a warm embrace and eventually offer dinner in a Tupperware container, making sure I ate. We would continue talking throughout the night, recapping our days, discussing friends, family, co-workers, and anything we had seen online recently. She always listened to me, and I did the same for her—at least, I hope I was as good a listener as she was.

I never felt fulfilled in my job, and I often found myself drifting into stressful topics that led to moments of silent dismay. I tried not to let it bother me too much. I always wanted children with her, but I felt we needed to build up our savings a bit more first. Although our new house was small, I dreamed of adding an extension to create more space for a family, especially since we had enough land to make it possible. At times, I felt responsible for our challenges, as if she deserved better than the difficulties we faced.

To counter these feelings, I would put on her favorite childhood show, *The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. She would light up whenever we watched it, and its wholesomeness always cheered me up too. Many nights, we would fall asleep with it playing in the background, only to wake up and repeat our routine the next day.

One day, when I came home from work and opened the door, she was standing there with a look I recognized immediately.

Looking down at the floor, as if afraid I might say no, she asked, “Can we get a dog?”

As much as I wanted to say, “Who’s going to walk it? And clean up after it?” I knew she had me, and I would do anything she wanted. She worked from home, and we didn’t have any pets. I had a feeling this was going to come up sooner or later.

The next couple of nights were spent researching breeds and local shelters, and it was so much fun. We reminisced about childhood pets, shared our fond memories with them, and discussed what we should be cautious of as we embarked on this venture. It felt like we were little kids who couldn’t sleep the night before Christmas.

We visited a few shelters, and it seemed like she was on the verge of tears because we couldn’t take home every animal we saw. Most of the dogs weren’t quite what we were looking for, but we kept searching. After visiting our third shelter, we found her. She was lying in her kennel with a polite, matter-of-fact demeanor, as if we were intruding on her tiny space—her home, however small it was. She had a blue merle coat, and according to the kennel employee, she was a rough collie and Labrador mix, about a year and a half old. She immediately stood up to greet my wife when she offered her scent, gently licking her hand. She was so sweet. The only problem was that we were short on time due to prior plans. We had only intended to visit, and if we found a dog, we planned to arrange the adoption for the weekend.

But this was different. Despite all our “research,” we decided to take a chance, canceled our plans, and brought her home. When we pulled into the driveway and parked, she was hesitant to leave her kennel. We had to carry it into our little living room, open the door, and eventually, she cautiously made her way out into the kitchen, where my wife had placed a small bowl of food for her. By the end of the night, she was lying on the floor of our bedroom upstairs. She felt safe with us, and we felt safe with her.

The next day was a Friday, and fortunately for both of us, we had the day off. The morning started out normally, except I had a little helper who made sure my once-silent routine was now loudly observed. I took her out into our large yard, and I had never seen anything happier. She had so much space to explore and looked so curious and free. Every plant and bug was a new discovery as we soaked in the cool late-summer morning. Once she had finished her business, the late riser was waiting for us in the kitchen with her coffee. Our new guest felt much more comfortable, and we were both excited to welcome her into our lives.

After a short game of fetch, my wife grabbed the car keys and excitedly said she wanted to run out to get some treats and a couple more toys. I laughed and took on the babysitter role as she waved to us while backing down the driveway.

An hour passed, and I began to feel a little concerned, but I figured she might have stopped to pick up breakfast. After two hours had gone by with no word from her, I had already called and texted. When three or four hours had passed, I was calling her every minute. The calls went straight to voicemail. As the sun began to set, I sat on the front porch, staring down the driveway, waiting for any sign of headlights. I called my sister, but she lived an hour away and had to work. She told me she would come by as soon as she got off. Our little guest was just happy to be able to run around and get some attention, which greatly helped in the midst of our growing concern.

When I first saw the headlights coming down our driveway, I shot up and jumped down the steps. I had never felt such a rush of relief. The weight of fear had been like a barbell strapped to my back, impossible to lift.

But as the car turned, I noticed the lights on top. It was black and white, and a surge of anger and embarrassment flooded me. The back of my neck burned white-hot. I couldn’t comprehend why this was happening. All she had done was go to the store.

Two state troopers pulled up next to me, their car coming to a quiet stop. They stepped out in unison, their movements precise and deliberate. The passenger-side trooper didn’t say a word as he approached. Gently, he placed an arm around my shoulders, steadying me as I knelt in the yard. His voice was soft, almost a whisper, as he asked, “Can we go inside?”

I still remember the faint glint of their name tags catching the light, momentarily piercing through my hollow stare. One read Murphy, the other Lancaster.

As she was merging onto a highway, a drunk driver, speeding and switching lanes recklessly, hit her. The impact knocked her off the shoulder of the road and into a tree. She died on impact.

My sister arrived at the house shortly after. One of the troopers gently took her outside to break the news, while the other stayed with me in the front room. They remained until she could compose herself, then left their contact information with her before returning to their duties.

Meanwhile, I hadn’t moved from the chair in the living room. I couldn’t move, and I didn’t want to. My sister draped a blanket around me and refused to leave my side. I wept and occasionally vomited into a bucket she had placed next to me. I neither ate nor slept that night. My sister lit candles in the living room, surrounding me in their glow, and tried to coax our little friend out from her hiding spot under our bed upstairs to feed her.

I still remember the darkness of that night. It should have poured rain, but instead, it was a warm, still evening. The silence was suffocating. The candles’ flames danced in my eyes whenever I chose to open them. The only sound came from my sister, who had fallen asleep on the couch next to me. Her somber snoring broke the stillness, a stark contrast to the silent despair that kept me wide awake.

As the sun began to rise, casting a gentle light through the windows like a tranquil alarm, fatigue finally began to overtake me. My heavy eyes started to close, pulling me into what felt like a new nightmare. But then, I felt a wet sensation on my hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair.

I sat up slightly, rubbed the gunk from my eyes, and leaned over to see our little guest. And it all started over again—not the weeping of loss, but the ache of what could have been and what would always stay with me. She had her tennis ball with her, and it felt as though she was saying, “I’m still here.”

That’s when I chose her name. I wanted her to share in the love I had for the one person I had always wanted to spend every second with. That’s when I named her Bonnie.

# Entry Two

My mornings were no longer silent. Bonnie had grown accustomed to being fed at a specific time, and she made sure I knew it. It felt like she practically dragged me out of bed and into the kitchen. My once quiet, careful morning routine had turned into a laid-back shuffle to serve her beloved breakfast, always followed by a little conversation between us. Sometimes, it feels like she knows she's the reason I get up each morning, keeping me going when I otherwise wouldn't.

Our morning walks around the property have become the only reason I leave the house. After my workplace found out what happened, they put me on leave to sort things out. It was a kind gesture, but honestly, I don't have any desire to go back. Everything I did for that job was for a greater purpose, and now that purpose is gone. I'll find something different when the time comes.

My sister calls frequently and visits often, usually staying more than one night. Her presence has become familiar, and it shows with Bonnie. She joins us on our walks, which is refreshing, even if it doesn't fix everything. I know she cares, but I also know nothing can really make it better.

When she stays over, she usually gets up before me to give me a little more time to stay in bed. She tends to overfeed Bonnie and play with her in a patronizing way. I can tell Bonnie isn't a fan, but I suppose the company is appreciated. Still, every night I see ghosts, and I can't shake the feeling of hearing her voice calling for me down the hall. It taunts me, reminding me of a wound that will never heal.

One evening, after dinner, I took Bonnie for her usual walk. Normally, we stay within view of the house, but I decided to go a little farther into the woods. I figured it couldn’t hurt as long as I remembered the way back. Bonnie led the way, per usual, and we made our way through some tall grass onto a rough dirt path shaded by the tree line. We heard a rustling sound nearby, and I assumed it was a squirrel or a rabbit. The silence that followed was deafening, but when the crickets started chirping again, we continued onward. The shadows cast by the trees made me think about returning during the day to escape the heat and harsh sunlight.

As we moved deeper, the rustling returned, this time closer. Bonnie stopped, and so did I. She sensed something was nearby but didn’t bark. Instead, she backed up toward me, her tail brushing against my legs. The crickets resumed, but Bonnie stayed still.

A coyote burst out of the bushes, startling both of us. Bonnie barked but didn’t advance. The coyote stood its ground, glaring at us, even taking a few steps forward. Fear crept in. What if there were more? What if they went after Bonnie? I quickly leashed her and retreated back towards the house.

Once we got home, I felt a little embarrassed by the encounter, though I’m not sure why. Bonnie seemed fine, so to lift her spirits, I decided to play with her for a while. She always told me that fetch was her favorite game, though she’s shown me a few others. I knew we had to get some playtime in before my sister came and insisted we go to bed. I hate when she gets in between us.

# Entry Three

My sister has pretty much made herself at home, settling into our old living room. I guess it’s fine, but every time I get a moment alone with Bonnie, our time is interrupted by a phone call—from guess who. She usually comes over on Wednesdays and stays until Sunday morning. Having someone around can be nice, but I can tell Bonnie’s starting to get tired of her, and honestly, so am I. She’s just always there. And while I’m grateful for her help, I’m also looking forward to when she gives me some space.

I’ve connected with Bonnie in a way my sister wouldn’t understand. I don’t think she needs to be here all the time. I’m doing a little better, but my sister keeps insisting something’s still wrong. She always says, *""I just don’t want anything else to happen, as long as I can help it.""* Everything is fine. The fact that she doesn’t believe me only makes me more upset. I’m tired of being treated like a child.

Our morning walks have become my only escape from her constant presence. I still think about returning to that shaded area in the woods where the trees block out the light, but I’m not sure I’m ready yet. My sister usually watches us from the kitchen window—I can always feel her there, like a shadow. Still, I’m glad I’m getting out of bed more often than before.

Recently, after one of our morning walks, my sister excitedly told me about a local dog park she wanted to take me to. I wasn’t thrilled about the idea. I don’t trust other people’s dogs around Bonnie, but she was insistent. She really wanted me to leave the house—it’s been a while since I have, and she’s been the one bringing in groceries while I spend most nights lost in thought.

Apparently, my reluctance was obvious, because she gave me an ultimatum: if I went to the dog park, she’d leave me alone for the rest of the week, at least until Sunday. If I didn’t, she’d come back on Thursday. I knew she was trying to be considerate, so I figured, why not?

It was a short drive across town. I sat next to Bonnie in the back seat, trying to keep her calm because of my sister’s erratic driving. I could tell she was stressed, but I knew this wouldn’t take long, and we could get back to our routine.

We pulled into a small parking lot next to the dog park. It wasn’t too bad—small, but luckily not crowded. I kept Bonnie leashed; I didn’t want her getting too close to anyone’s dog. Most people were leaning against the fence near the parking lot, barely paying attention to their dogs, while a few were playing in a small area. My sister rubbed my back, making me jump. She offered to walk Bonnie, but I refused to give up the leash.

A bright yellow tennis ball landed at my feet, and just as I reached down to pick it up, Bonnie grabbed it. I laughed and tried to take it from her mouth when I noticed a pretty Saluki dog standing in front of us, curiously sniffing Bonnie. They exchanged sniffs under my watchful eye, and I kept a firm grip on the leash, ready to pull Bonnie away if anything went wrong. Just then, someone called out,

*""Winnie!""*

When I looked up, I froze. A woman with shoulder-length strawberry-blonde hair was walking toward us. She wore round, wire-frame glasses, and her bright blue eyes met mine as she smiled. Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she brushed her hair back before pointing at the leash.  


*""You don’t have to leash them inside the gates,""* she said. *""I understand though! You never know how these things will go. What’s her name?""*  


I could hardly speak, but luckily, my sister chimed in. She told her Bonnie’s name and complimented her dog for being “cute and fluffy.” Then, doing me a favor, she said she had left something in the car, adding, *“Take care of my brother while I’m gone.”*

Her name was Amy, and she worked as a dental assistant in town. She had a special fondness for long walks with her dog, whose name was inspired by a favorite childhood character.

Before I knew it, I found out she was free this Saturday. I don’t know why, but I’m excited, even though I feel like I shouldn’t be. When I told my sister, she almost jumped out of the driver’s seat in excitement. She even promised to babysit Bonnie. I just hope she treats Bonnie well while I’m gone.

# Entry Four 

When I finally had some time to myself, I started to think more about what I had gotten myself into. I’m not ready to go on a date with anyone right now. I just thought it would be nice to spend time with someone besides my sister for a change.

I haven’t been this nervous in a long time, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for something like this. It felt too soon. I figured I’d let a few days pass and maybe come up with an excuse to get out of it.

Even after some time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that what I was doing was wrong. I still felt like I was making a mistake. I didn’t know what to do until my sister called me on Wednesday. As much as she annoys me sometimes, she knows how to calm me down. She reminded me that this didn’t have to be anything serious if I didn’t want it to be, and I shouldn’t feel bad about being attracted to someone. She even extended the time before she’d check in on me again, which made me feel better. Honestly, I just wanted to get through it and return to spending time with Bonnie.

As the week went on, I just felt worse. I almost came up with an excuse—like pretending I was sick or saying something came up with my family—but I knew if I went through with it, it wouldn’t be so bad, and I’d finally get the space I needed. I checked in with Amy the day before, and she seemed excited. Up until then, our communication had been light—just a few funny exchanges about dog memes.

I barely slept the night before, but not for the usual reasons. My sister came over a couple of hours early, and I guess she helped lift my mood a little. It felt like I was gearing up for something big, like I was supposed to win some kind of race.

She helped with the dishes while I got dressed. Bonnie helped me pick out a nice shirt, which gave me a little confidence—I could feel her cheering me on. But the guilt hit me hard when I realized I was about to leave her behind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that my sister wouldn’t take good care of her. I should’ve just come up with an excuse.

When it was time to leave, it felt like I was saying goodbye for good. I backed out of the driveway, waving to my sister and Bonnie. I could see the sadness in Bonnie’s eyes—she didn’t even come to the car. I kept telling myself it would all be over soon.

Amy and I had agreed to meet at a coffee shop and then take a walk in a nearby park. Before I had decided to have a fit, it seemed like a good idea to get to know her better. Now, I regretted it. Still, I felt the need to show up early so I wouldn’t keep her waiting—it seemed like the right thing to do.

I found a table in the corner, feeling out of place as other people worked on their laptops or met with friends. It was the waiting that was the hardest part, like I was an outsider looking in. The quiet hum of conversations around me broke when she finally walked through the door.

She was dressed nicely, with her makeup done and her hair styled. Instinctively, I sat up straighter and checked my breath. I don’t know why I hadn’t eaten anything yet. She spotted me and came over for an awkward side-hug before sitting down. I offered to get her a drink while she got settled. She politely declined at first, but I insisted.

She asked for a cappuccino, and since I only drink coffee at home, I panicked and ordered the same thing. I admitted I didn’t know much about coffee, and she laughed. We talked about small things: where we went to school, childhood interests, favorite movies or shows.

It felt good to have a normal conversation, even though I hadn’t really watched much since everything happened with Bonnie. Amy told me she got Winnie during a tough time in her life too. I didn’t go into detail about what happened to me—I just called it a *""tough time.""* But when I mentioned how important Bonnie was to me, I started choking up. I excused myself to the bathroom, but I’m pretty sure she noticed.

When I came back, she placed her hand on mine and said, *“Pets are family, but they always feel like good friends at first.”* It made me feel a little better, but she didn’t really understand how much Bonnie means to me. Honestly, her comment felt like a bit of a reach.

We kept talking about Bonnie and Winnie. She shared her favorite games to play with Winnie, and I mentioned a few of mine, but she didn’t seem that interested. I noticed her looking away and making odd expressions as I spoke. I wasn’t sure why. I hadn’t reacted that way when she was talking.

She quickly changed the subject to the weather, and we decided to head to the park for a walk. It was a beautiful fall afternoon—golden leaves, bright sunshine, and a gentle breeze. The summer humidity was gone, making the day feel perfect. I was even more excited because I knew I was closer to going home to Bonnie.

As we walked, Amy talked about how fascinating she found the connection between dogs and humans. She thought it was strange how dogs follow and rely on humans through a leader-follower relationship. In the wild, there isn’t an alpha dog—they hunt and live in packs as a family unit.

That idea stuck with me. I told her how I used to really want a family, how important it was to me at one point. It felt like something I had held close but then lost. I wasn’t sure anymore if it was something I still wanted.

We walked around the park a couple of times, sharing funny family stories and laughing together. Time slipped by, and before I knew it, the sun was setting. I felt like I was almost at the finish line. She mentioned needing to check on Winnie and said she’d text me later. We said our goodbyes, and I walked to my car, feeling lighter.

On the drive home, I could feel the pressure on the accelerator—I couldn’t wait to see Bonnie and tell my sister how it went. As soon as I pulled up, Bonnie ran out to greet me saying *“Please don’t leave again!”* I told my sister about the date, and she hugged me so tightly it felt like she was squeezing all the tension out of me. She said she was proud of me, but had to head home soon, though Bonnie still needed to go out. In that moment, I couldn’t have been happier.

I grabbed Bonnie’s leash, and we waved goodbye from the porch as we rounded the house, heading toward the field where the trees covered the sky. I felt unstoppable. It was a full moon that night, and I wanted to see the moonlight spill through the canopy as we listened to the crickets and watched the fireflies flicker in the dark.

But when we reached the tree-covered area, the crickets had fallen silent, and the fireflies seemed too shy to show themselves. It was a bit disappointing. I hadn’t expected much, but I had hoped for more. The night was still beautiful, though—clouds had rolled in, making it darker than I’d imagined.

As we stood there, I felt a strange silence settle over us. It felt familiar in a way I couldn’t quite place. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and a sense of discomfort filled the air. There was this unshakable feeling of danger, like something was watching us.

Bonnie’s fur bristled, and she positioned herself in front of me, feet wide apart, alert and protective. I sensed something too, and just like before, the bushes across from us rustled. This time, a coyote burst out—but not in the cautious way it had before. It leapt at us with aggression, baring its fangs. Bonnie, usually so brave, tucked her tail and retreated behind me.

Without thinking, I scooped her up, adrenaline fueling my strength, and ran back toward the house as fast as I could, fear propelling me forward.

When we got back to the house, Bonnie hid under the kitchen table for most of the night and when I went to sleep she slept underneath the bed. I was humiliated. I don’t know why I thought anything good could have come from going back there. I don’t know why I couldn’t have protected her when it counted. I know that I will never allow that to happen again. I know that I have learned what was needed to protect our family.

# Entry Five

Good morning, Dr. Meier,

It has been quite some time since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out to express my concerns about my brother, Nick. I deeply respect the importance of client confidentiality in supporting his healing, but I am genuinely worried about his well-being.

After Nick lost Bonnie, I may have been too involved in trying to support him. It felt strange when he named their newly adopted dog ""Bonnie"" so soon after her passing. I understood his desire to preserve her memory, but it seemed like an unfair burden to place on another animal that couldn’t understand its significance.

I gently suggested other names, but Nick was adamant about naming her Bonnie. At first, it seemed to help him cope, especially during times when I couldn’t be there. Knowing that this new Bonnie gave him a reason to get outside offered some reassurance, as I feared he might otherwise retreat entirely.

I know I can be pushy, but I felt compelled to encourage him to leave the house and stay active. I worried about him isolating himself and feared the worst. I just wanted to help him in any way I could.

When Nick met Amy, I was thrilled. Seeing him connect with someone on a personal level gave me hope. It was a relief to know he had someone else besides me to lean on.

However, I’ve grown increasingly worried about his attachment to the new Bonnie. He seems overly protective of her and dislikes when I interact with her in ways he doesn’t approve of, which happens often. He claims to know her “favorite games” but never explains them. I’ve overheard him having long, detailed conversations with her, but he goes silent the moment he realizes I’m nearby. It often feels like he’s discussing something about me with her.

Recently, I witnessed something concerning. Through the kitchen window, I saw him walking Bonnie. He let her off the leash, then sat on the ground in a posture mimicking a dog. Suddenly, he sprinted across the yard on all fours, chasing her. As strange as it sounds, he was surprisingly fast, almost catching up to her.

When I visited him recently, something felt very off. Normally, he greets me at the front porch, but this time, he didn’t. I waited, then checked the front door, which was unlocked. Inside, the house was in disarray—uncleaned and foul-smelling, like urine. After calling for him multiple times, he entered through the front door with Bonnie following. Her fur was unkempt, and she desperately needed a bath. Nick looked similarly disheveled—his clothes were dirty, and he clearly hadn’t shaved in some time.

I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me, focusing on feeding Bonnie by pouring food directly on the floor. I attempted to clean up a bit, preparing to mop the floors at least, but he angrily dumped the bucket of water outside, saying Bonnie would get upset if I cleaned. He told me to leave it alone, so I played along, sensing he wasn’t in the right state of mind.

We sat in the living room—me on an unstained ottoman and him in a filthy chair. I tried making conversation, hoping he’d share something about what was going on, but he wouldn’t budge. He eventually told me he didn’t need me checking on him anymore. He said he was fine and didn’t need “babysitting.”

His dismissal upset me, and I admit I reacted emotionally. I demanded to know what was going on, saying I couldn’t bear to lose him after already losing a sister-in-law. This triggered an angry outburst. He began yelling, clenching his fists—behavior I’m familiar with as his sibling—but something about his cadence felt off.

When Nick stood up to leave the room, I hoped he might calm down. Instead, Bonnie began barking, mirroring his agitation. She bared her teeth and, without warning, lunged at me. Nick grabbed her just in time, making it clear that I needed to leave immediately.

I don’t want to get my brother or Bonnie into trouble, but I believe it’s time to reach out to him and encourage him to speak with you. Please let me know if you hear from him.

Thank you,  
Millie Robertson

# Entry Six

Good Morning,

As a precautionary measure before notifying local authorities for a welfare check on Mr. Nick Robertson, I am submitting the following entry from our journaling system, which is required for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.

I have been working with Mr. Robertson to navigate the grieving process, but I am concerned that I have not been successful in helping him fully process his recent traumatic experiences or rebuild trust within his immediate family.

Please review the attached journal entry and ensure it is placed into records accessible to the police, should the need arise.

Thank you,  
Dr. Meier

I have found true happiness living with Bonnie and our family. Together, we have claimed this land, and with time, our numbers will grow. Bonnie has shown me my true purpose, and I will never allow anything—or anyone—to stand in the way of that. I’ve proven my loyalty to Bonnie time and time again as we’ve ventured to the farthest reaches of our home.

The forest, where the trees weave their shadows, belongs to us now. When the coyote appeared, I made my presence known. It challenged me, but I responded with a message that its kind will never forget. They now know their place, and some have even fallen in line, following me with a loyalty you could never understand. I lead them, and they obey—unlike you.

I am more complete than I’ve ever been. The past means nothing. The only thing that matters is what I have now, and I have everything I need. I don’t need you, and I never did. You were supposed to help me, but all I ever saw was your selfishness, your hollow attempts to justify your work. You don’t care about me. You only care about your job, about pretending to help people. But you don’t. You never did.

I know you’ll send others after us once you read this. We will endure no matter what. This land—our land—has outgrown its boundaries, and now our home stretches far beyond where you think it ends. We will thrive, and you will wither. Your weakness has always been your downfall.

# Entry Seven

**Martinsburgh Police Department Report**  
**Case Number:** 078221  
**Date:** 11/17/2026

On November 14th, 2025, at approximately 1530 hours, I was dispatched to (STREET ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY) for a welfare check on the occupant, Nicholas ROBERTSON. Upon arrival, OFC LANCASTER and I met with Millie L. ROBERTSON, who was waiting for us outside the residence.

We spoke with Ms. ROBERTSON briefly to understand the situation involving Mr. ROBERTSON. After our conversation, we approached the front door of the residence. Attempting to look through the windows on the front porch proved ineffective due to heavy dirt and grime obscuring the glass.

We knocked on the door, announcing our presence, but received no response. Ms. ROBERTSON attempted to open the door, which was unlocked. As she did, we heard a disturbance around the side of the house. Moments later, approximately twenty dogs came running into view. The dogs were barking aggressively and behaving erratically. OFC LANCASTER and I retreated from the porch to call for backup and animal control. Although the dogs were difficult to manage, none of them bit anyone on the scene.

Once backup officers arrived, efforts were made to distract and corral the dogs, allowing us to safely re-approach the house. Upon opening the front door, we were met by an additional dozen dogs rushing out of the home. The scene inside was chaotic and unsanitary, with dried dirt and feces covering the walls and floors. The home appeared to be in complete disrepair.

Ms. ROBERTSON became visibly upset and began calling out for her brother while moving through the home. Despite our attempts to keep her outside to ensure her safety, she insisted on searching for him. She eventually ran upstairs, where we followed to remove her from the premises for further investigation.

The upstairs bedroom was in slightly better condition than the rest of the house. While securing the area and escorting Ms. ROBERTSON outside, OFC LANCASTER observed a large torn-apart box on the bedroom floor. Printed on the side of the box was the name “Novatek.”

OFC LANCASTER conducted a quick search on his phone to learn more about Novatek. The results revealed an article about a Japanese man who had gained widespread attention for commissioning an incredibly lifelike dog costume from the company. The photos accompanying the article showed a costume so detailed it was nearly impossible to distinguish it from a real animal, complete with synthetic fur, anatomically accurate features, and lifelike movements. OFC LANCASTER shared this information with me, and it was at this moment we realized that one of the dogs on the premises was likely Mr. ROBERTSON.

OFC LANCASTER and I quickly exited the home and returned to the front yard, where most of the dogs had already escaped containment. They were seen running across the open field behind the house and into a distant tree line. Among the fleeing dogs, one stopped momentarily, stood upright on its hind legs, and then disappeared into the forest.

# Epilogue

Hello Dr. Meier,

I’ve tried reaching out to you through calls and texts as much as I could after everything that happened. First, I want to sincerely apologize for the media fallout following the investigation into my brother’s home. We’re doing our best to restore the property and eventually put it on the market, though it seems like it will be a long time before anyone feels comfortable purchasing it.

That said, I would feel a lot better if I could hear from you. I understand if you’ve been avoiding my attempts to reach out—I wouldn’t blame you. I feel responsible for so much of this and just want to find a way to make things right.

There’s something I need to bring to your attention as well. When I searched my brother’s house the day he disappeared, I found an address written on a piece of paper taped to his old refrigerator. When I looked it up, I discovered it was tied to your name. I hope it’s an old or temporary residence because I don’t believe my brother has any reason to seek you out—or at least, I haven’t seen any signs of hostility toward you. If you’ve experienced anything unusual, please let me know as soon as you can.

I’ve also heard unsettling reports from friends about hunters being attacked by wild dogs in the woods. One story mentioned a creature moving so quickly and violently it didn’t seem like anything they’d ever seen. I’m hoping these are just exaggerated tales. Still, I hear howling in the woods around my home. Some nights it feels louder and closer, like it’s calling out to me—or maybe coming for me. Either way, I know there’s no place for me there anymore.

Please take care,

1hpa2jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hpa2jc/newly_diagnosed_is_it_incurable/,Newly diagnosed - is it incurable?,"So I had clostridium difficile infection one month ago and was slowly getting better. One day I woke up and started having reflux out of nowhere. I dont understand it at all as of course I had very mild diet for a long time now (due to clostridium), I lost weight, so I am super skinny. I have reflux after every meal, doesnt matter what I eat.

I read about GERD and I am so scared and in absolute panic state. I was suppose to eat a lot of veggies and fruits in order to build better microbiome and in a few weeks or months get to the point where I will be able to eat more or less everything, drink coffee etc.

Now I am completely heartbroken. I am afraid of eating, I feel that I am going crazy. Is this disease incurable? It will be impossible to ever feel good after food, eat whatever I want and drink coffee? And that for the entire life? Or maybe there are cases when reflux dissapear / can be beaten and some people get back to normal life and eating not only super light food?",3,1735517841.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I have a Breville touch, and I just did a little research to come across Red Bird Coffee. I use their red bird espresso, and I’ve been pretty happy with it. I am mostly drinking americanos and lattes. It seems to be good enough as an everyday/Jack of all trades. I’m wondering about branching out to try something new just out of curiosity. I’m looking  for opinions of those who have tried Black and White Coffee. My questions are as follows: 
1) what is the best clean everyday that B&W offers (in your opinion)
2) if you’ve also tried Red Bird, what are your thoughts on comparison? ",1,1735517823.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1hpa1l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hpa1l3/aitah_for_walking_out_of_my_moms_room_after_she/,AITAH for walking out of my mom’s room after she tricked me into getting angry?,"Please DO NOT share this story on social media or anywhere else.

For some context that will become relevant further down, I (16M) am a Muslim, and so is the rest of my family. Islamic tradition encourages that one memorizes the Quran, which is the holy scripture in Islam.

My mom (45F) has been a cruel person for as long as I remember. She is by no means a bad mother, and I am grateful to have her in my life, but she has several deeply rooted problems that she needs to address in my opinion. For one, since I was a little kid her and my dad (49M) have argued a lot. The arguments are always about different things, and I would say that 95% of the time she is the one who initiates them, while my dad just tries to calm her down and deescalate.

During their arguments in my childhood, my mom tried to walk out on us (me and my siblings, brother 19M and two fraternal twin sisters 14F) several times, one time even reaching the airport before my dad relaxed her and got her home. I was too young to know or understand what their arguments are about, but in recent years it’s seemed like she thinks my dad is too controlling and neglectful, accusing him of cheating several times with no evidence and telling him to “go and stay with your girlfriends” once in an argument. My dad has confided in me and my brother to say he has never once been with a lady other than my mom, and of course we both believe him.

My dad hurt my mom only one time, during an argument in the kitchen a knife nearby flying at her into her leg and cutting about an inch deep into her, thankfully her brother (my uncle) was there to help with the wound, and they had a laugh about it afterwards. Contrastingly, my mom has laid hands on my dad several times, from hitting to almost throwing a glass coffee table over his head. She has also laid hands on me and my siblings in the past countless times, hitting with hard-bottom shoes, slippers, wooden spoons, metal spoons, and so on. 

When I was 14, I got into school trouble for doing some bad things, after which I got suspended for a day. My mom proceeded to hurt me a lot, stepping on me, biting me, pulling my hair, hitting with shoes, and so on. I proceeded to cry in my room afterwards, while my mom continued arguing with herself and calling me derogatory names to try and shame me. After that incident, I became more religious and started to gain more self confidence. For context, I have been quite fat for a while, since I was about 9 or 10 I started eating a lot to the point where at 11/12 I was 5’3” and weighed almost 100kg (~220lbs). Since I turned 14, I had several growth spurts and am now 6’1.5” and weigh 90kg, a lot less of which is fat thanks to going to the gym and eating better (I am still fat, don’t get me wrong, but I am nowhere near what I used to be like and it greatly improved my self-confidence). 

Today’s incident was really not that eventful, but I don’t think I realized how psychologically manipulative she was until today. I had memorized a 2 page chapter of the Quran and wanted her to test my memorization by listening and following along to check for mistakes. I asked her 3 days ago, to which she said that she was exhausted from work and was going to go to sleep. Understandable I guess, so I waited until the next day at around 8PM and asked her again, to which she ignored me and just continued scrolling on her phone. I asked her “are you scrolling on Facebook to ignore me?” She looked up at me with this super annoying smirk and just said ‘yeah’. At this point I was angry, but decided not to say anything and went to my room. Today, I asked her one final time. She was just about to go upstairs to her bedroom when I asked her, and she said “I’m going to the toilet now.” I asked her “when you’re finished?” I asked several times repeating myself until she just said maybe, scoffed and went to the toilet. I brushed it off and waited for her, then asked her if she could. She was annoyed and said “let’s get it over with then (in our native language),” in a rude tone. I sat down to start reciting what I had memorized, when I noticed her scrolling on something on her phone. I asked her “are you scrolling instead of following along?” She ignored me and just said “come on, start!” in an obviously angry tone. I asked her “what’s the point if you won’t follow along?” And she said “if you don’t start now, get out of my room.” I said fine and stood up to leave, to which she said “you missed your chance!” with a villainous smirk as if she had won some sort of competition, only to turn her phone at me and show me that she was scrolling to follow along. I asked her why she didn’t just tell me she was, to which she responded by just shouting at me to get out. I told her that if it were someone younger like my sisters, what she did would have really discouraged them from learning, to which she just shouted get out again. I left angry and hurt and closed myself up in my room. She called out for someone a bit ago, I opened the door and I said “did you call me?” To which she just said “I’m angry with you, don’t talk to me.”

Did I do something wrong? I am just hurt and confused by the way she has treated me my whole life, parenting with pure rage and anger.

She has said to me in the past that she never wanted to have kids and hated kids before she had us, and my brother overheard her on a phone call once telling her friend that she has bipolar disorder, which would honestly explain how she can go from calm to angry in half a second. 

That incident is not isolated either, often when I try to tell her something seriously or try to confide in her she either scoffs at me, completely ignores me and just texts on her phone, or gives me a half baked answer that doesn’t help me. 

To her credit, she has always supported me with stuff like my education and hobbies, spending a lot of money on me to improve my gaming setup and promising to get me a Mandarin teacher next year as I love learning new languages, as a few examples. She does however expect straight As from me and threatens me with horrible threats if I underperform. A few months back, she got an attitude to learning screening from my school, where in 2 subjects out of 10 it said that I need to improve. She flipped and when she called me (on her way back from work) she told me that she regrets the day I was born, along with a lot of other hurtful comments like that. 

Since I was 13, me, my mom and my siblings have been living in a different country for better education, while my dad stayed back to make us money and support our lifestyle. He visits 2 months a year, but whenever he does my mom starts horrible fights with him about silly things and twists his words and actions in her favor. He said to me and my brother several times that she made his live a living hell and you could clearly see it. He said that the only reason he hasn’t divorced her yet was because my sisters are still children and that they would when my sisters are adults.

Honestly, this is barely scratching the surface. I would need hours to explain everything but I just need to know what I should do.

my mom refused to ever put him in a nursing home, no matter what, because she vowed that she wouldn't when they got married. seeing how hard this has been on her has been hard for me and I wish she would be open to other options for care. i don't believe he's getting the level of care he needs despite my mom's constant efforts, because she's not a nurse. I've expressed to her that he would not want her to give up her entire life like this, but she says there is no way she's putting him in any kind of facility. she often complains about how there's no help for her, when that simply isn't true. this is going to sound selfish, but after years of this, i just want my mom back. she has never been able to come visit me where i live now (the one time she booked a trip, the day she was supposed to leave my step-dad was hospitalized for stroke), and when i do come to visit, i can't even do something as simple as go to lunch or go get a coffee with my mom. all because she won't even leave him with a trusted family member for a few hours. we've gotten into huge arguments about this more times than i can count, but i've always tried to keep my patience with her, because what she's going through is without a doubt harder than anything i've ever done, but between watching his decline and feeling like my mom hasn't deliberately \*chosen\* me in years, i'm really struggling.  

i have no idea how much time he has left. my gut is telling me it's less than i thought before i came home to visit for the holidays. this shit is hard as hell. ",3,1735517594.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

The drinking culture in my country is a bit much so everyone could probably tone it down a bit, but my boyfriend has been particularly bad ever since his father passed two years ago and it’s been really rough.

In general he takes really good care of me, he is very considerate and takes mind to do the little things like running errands and making me coffee. I’m not an easy person to be with, as I do suffer from depression which has worsened considerably as a young close family member suddenly passed in a tragic accident in the spring. I do go to work, study and go out though, so I’m not a complete disaster, just a sad homebody mostly.

He drinks often, multiple times a week and it doesn’t matter that it’s a weekday. It messes with my schedule as he cannot come home quietly and we have a dog, so he wakes us both and hypes the dog up when he arrives at anywhere from 1-7 in the morning. I worry so much as he’s bad at communicating and will tell me he’ll be home at one time and then just won’t be with no message or call. He’s been assaulted multiple times while out so it’s so stressful. He has times when he comes home really sad and needs comforting and times he comes home to pick a fight where he (in my opinion) is extremely hard to reason with yet refuses to stop.

I am so tired and sad. We’ve discussed this so many times and it’s like he agrees to change, but doesn’t really want to. I can’t expect him home when he says he will be, he doesn’t respect my time at all if I say I’d prefer him to be home early as I have work/school/projects and he lies, especially about how much he drinks or if he’s taken something (even though he’s promised to stop that completely). It’s really messing with my mental state and I feel so alone. I love him so much, but when he drinks it’s like he becomes an entirely different person and I really don’t like him like that, but it’s his coping mechanism for his grief so it seems like he just doesn’t want to/can’t give it up. I’m sorry for rambling but I just really need some advice on how to fix this. I seem to just not be able to communicate this with him properly.

For context, the BTI replaced an older Jura SuperAutomatic that was used mostly for lattes, three or so in the morning.  I have been using a local roaster who supplies some medium roast Honduran beans with that machine.  The drinks have been fine.  My initial set of drinks with the Touch Impress used these same beans with the single walled double basket grind setting 17.  Lattes were fine.

I received some darker roast beans for Christmas and I am using those for the second filling of the bean hopper.  I decided to use the Intelligent Brew function again, started at 15 as instructed and the initial shot was very bitter.  That did not surprise me given the second batch of beans is darker and quite oily.  However, the Intelligent Brew function kept asking if the coffee tasted to weak to decrease the grind size, just the opposite of what was needed, that is if the shot was too bitter then I thought I should make the grind size larger not smaller?  I increased the grind size to 20 and the shot was still a little bitter but the Intelligent Brew kept stating that I the brew was to weak then to decrease the  grind size.  I ignored that.

Some other observations and questions:

1) Does the Intelligent Brew function always suggest a finer grind size?

2) Tio dial in new beans it seems I do not need the Intelligent brew function because I can adjust the grind size, sample the output, and adjust again as needed.

3) The plastic bumper that is supposed to protect the front of the drip tray comes off so easily I just don't use it.

4) The accessory tray that attaches to the drip tray comes loose from the drip tray easily and it is difficult to remove it when detached.  It is a pain to use so I put the accessories in a plastic bag in a drawer.

I have ordered a scale to work on the extraction process and I think that will help with dialing in beans more than the Intelligent Brew function.

# The Sami People: Organ Meats and Performance

https://preview.redd.it/a7cl4iepkv9e1.jpg?width=1999&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3aa03fb5a6c052758096555e6255056a381f6e7f

***Photo****: Norwegian reindeer have been domesticated by the Sami, who have exclusive rights over the national herd.* 

The Sami people, indigenous to Norway, Sweden, Finland and parts of Russia, offer a remarkable lesson in using nature’s resources. They eat reindeer nose-to-tail, ensuring nothing goes to waste. But they often reserve the best cuts, including the organs, primarily for their hard-working herding dogs.

Why? Organs are nutrient-dense superfoods, rich in vitamins, minerals and amino acids that are essential for endurance. Their dogs are often gone for days at a time herding reindeer in extreme conditions, and they rely on these nutrients to perform. One Sami man I talked to jokingly said that if he gets tired, he takes a break. His dogs don’t; they do not stop until the job is finished. And that’s why they often get the best meals.

This approach highlights the incredible value of organ meats — not just for dogs, but for humans too. Unfortunately, many of us overlook these powerhouse foods.

# Barefoot In the Arctic: Staying Warm Naturally

https://preview.redd.it/zpkbthfflv9e1.jpg?width=1999&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f0e5a26aa4c0083dc3380f52010b2267be5d7c9

***Photo***: *Maybe next time we’ll come back in Summer instead 🙂*

If you think thin-soled boots can’t handle the Arctic cold, think again. My barefoot boots not only kept my feet warm but outperformed Kathy’s thick-soled traditional winter boots. Why? Flexible, minimalist footwear allows your feet to move naturally, stimulating circulation and keeping them warm.

This trip reaffirmed my belief in barefoot shoes. If you’re curious about transitioning to minimalist footwear or finding the best shoes for any occasion, check out my [**blog post**](https://michaelkummer.com/barefoot-shoes-benefits/) and [**YouTube video**](https://youtu.be/te510VkW8dU?si=yCYdXq4Xd2gPUg2_).

→ If you want to see my barefoot boots in action in the Arctic, check out the clip I published on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DD8KCkyg_PV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/90-hEdtsy9I?feature=share).

**Pro tip**: Many traditional boots restrict movement and cut off circulation, making your feet colder. Switching to barefoot boots with room for toe splay can make all the difference.

# Cold Water and Vitamin D: A Surprising Connection

Tromsø’s near-total darkness in December presented a unique challenge. With no sunlight for weeks, you’d expect Vitamin D deficiency to be widespread. But we discovered a fascinating alternative: cold water exposure. 

Recent research shows that cold water immersion stimulates biophoton production, which may help facilitate the body’s ability to produce Vitamin D — even in the absence of sunlight.

We embraced this by [plunging into icy fjords and the Arctic Ocean](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DD-bB99SDm2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), following a 15-minute hot sauna and 1 to 2-minute cold plunge protocol. Not only was it invigorating, but it also boosted our mood, energy, and resilience. 

**Educational nugget**: Biophotons are ultra-weak light emissions produced by cells during metabolic processes. Cold exposure activates these emissions, potentially supporting processes like vitamin D synthesis and mitochondrial function.

# Seafood: A Nutrient Goldmine

https://preview.redd.it/fgihklxrlv9e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6038da154245aa57fc1c4fbc7070fa5d54cd689f

***Photo****: Eating raw sea urchin testicles was a first for us.*

Norwegian cuisine is rooted in seafood, and it’s easy to see why. Fish, shellfish and even sea urchins are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, iodine and selenium — nutrients that are crucial for brain health, thyroid function and inflammation control.

One highlight of our trip was eating raw sea urchin reproductive organs, an adventurous but rewarding experience. It reminded us of the importance of nutrient density in our diets, inspiring us to incorporate more high-quality seafood at home.

**Fun fact**: Sea urchin gonads are incredibly high in zinc, an essential mineral for immune health, hormone production and wound healing.

# Sauna + Cold Plunge: The Ultimate Combo?

In Norway, sauna bathing almost always includes cold plunging. This combination raises an interesting question: how many of the benefits ascribed to saunas come from the heat, the cold, or the interplay between the two?

We stuck to a 15-minute hot and 1-minute cold protocol throughout our trip. The result? No illness, even while others around us were falling sick. This dual exposure trains the body to handle stress, boosts circulation, and strengthens the immune system.

→ Check out our sauna and cold plunge experiences in Oslo ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mkummer82/reel/DDNamluyeAP/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/IcjpAMJhaGE?feature=share)) and the Arctic ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mkummer82/reel/DDXuaqlyQxw/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/47_qY9Sk71c?feature=share)). 

**Educational nugget**: Studies show that alternating hot and cold exposure enhances vascular function by expanding and contracting blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. You can learn more about the benefits of combining sauna bathing and cold plunging [in this article](https://michaelkummer.com/ice-bath-and-sauna/).

# Plastic-Free Living and Food Quality

One of the most refreshing aspects of Norway was its minimal plastic usage. Even small amounts of plastic, like liners in coffee cups, are clearly labeled. It’s a stark contrast to what we often see in the U.S. However, we noticed the encroachment of American fast food chains, and the difference in food quality was unmistakable. Traditional Norwegian cuisine, with its emphasis on local, fresh ingredients, simply tastes better and feels healthier.

**Pro tip**: Start reducing your plastic footprint by opting for reusable containers, and always check for hidden plastics in disposable products.

This trip was a reminder of how much we can learn by stepping outside our routines. From the Sami people’s nose-to-tail diet to the benefits of cold exposure, there’s so much we can incorporate into our own lives to thrive in the new year.

# What’s New at MK Supplements

* **Our** [**stainless steel spoons**](https://shop.michaelkummer.com/products/stainless-steel-measuring-spoon) **are now available for purchase in the United States**, and we’ll soon make them available to international customers as well. While the current lot of Collagen & Colostrum still includes plastic spoons, the next lot will no longer include a spoon in an effort to reduce plastic waste and microplastic contamination. 
* **We’re removing the plastic neck wrap from most of our products** in exchange for under-the-lid seals in an attempt to further reduce plastic waste.
* **We just placed an order for home-compostable pouches** that we’ll use for our powdered products. That will practically eliminate all plastics from our product packaging!

Stay tuned for more updates directly from MK Supplements soon.

# Kummer Homestead Updates

***Photo****: We’re grateful for having had the opportunity to raise the centerpiece of our Thanksgiving dinner in our own backyard.*

I’m not exaggerating when I say that the backyard-raised turkey we had for Thanksgiving this year was the best we ever had. Paired with sweet potatoes from our garden and not-so-animal-based sourdough goodies Kathy baked, Thanksgiving dinner was a total success. 

Right after returning from our Norway trip, we butchered 18 chickens to stock the freezer for the next couple of months. Kathy’s mom and aunt, who flew in from Costa Rica to help out, did not enjoy the freezing temperatures on butchering day.

https://preview.redd.it/5vpfqeeznv9e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=330d17e6ae06cc0fec17fae365fed178292e1ae4

***Photo****: Costa Ricans and freezing temperatures don’t go together…*

On the bright side, life on the homestead has slowed down. But I’ll keep busy with making repairs and upgrading our equipment so we can be more efficient next year (we already ordered 25 more meat chickens, and 10 additional turkeys).

***Photo****: The new Peluva Mesh Sport are my favorite workout shoes.*

That’s a wrap for 2024. Thanks again to Peluva for supporting this month’s newsletter. Check out [my hands-on Peluva review on YouTube](https://youtu.be/sqLWcYhah2A) and learn how minimalist shoes can dramatically improve your foot health and posture, and even alleviate lower back pain.

One thing I know I do poorly at is eating decent carbs, I tend to go from one sugary thing to another due to low appetite and depression. However, the food I keep in my house is much healthier than the avg household, even the sugary things.

I’m sure it’s just the brain fog and it’ll take a few days to clear but can I hear from someone other than my inner monologue that it will?

I'm new to trying this and just thought I'd give it a shot.  Just hoping to meet one (or more) buds to hang out with (friends only - nothing more).  Memphis / North MS. 

I'm a single, formerly married, average WM with a grown kid, so I never felt very connected to the LGBT+ community.  I wanted to be but, I was busy working and being a dad for a long time.  I don't resent it -- that was the best experience ever. But it didn't allow me to meet friends in the community much. 

I like sporting events, live music, coffee shops, gym/working out, shooting pool, day hiking,  sports bars, good food, movies, NCAA / SEC sports, NBA basketball, community service, and great conversations. I'm active in a traditional faith community but that's not an expectation for anyone else. You do you. 

Physically I'm a tall-ish, white guy with a slim-ish/athletic build (6-1; 180) so I try to watch what I eat and a light drinker in moderation. 

I like talking and getting to know people.  Top values for me are family, friends, community, and faith. Politically I'm left-leaning.  I like hearing about people's life experiences, cultures, etc.  I'm semi-nerdy on some topics, and I'm learning Spanish. 

Hope to hear from some guys around here.  A bro would be nice to hang with.  I tend to click well with working-class, military, everyday kinds of people.  So let's talk and see if we can hang out. ",1,1735516397.0,gayfriendfinder,0,1.0,False
1hp9jt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilomenaCunk/comments/1hp9jt0/cunk_on_incels/,Cunk On Incels,"Incels are people who call themselves ""involuntary celibates,"" which means they’re not having sex but not by choice. It’s a bit like being unemployed but angrier about it. Instead of blaming the job market, though, they blame women. They’ll say things like, “All women only date bad boys like Chad who drive sports cars,” as if women come pre-programmed to hate modest hatchbacks and nice manners. Apparently, it’s everyone else’s fault they’re not pulling, which is a bit like blaming fish for not jumping into your boat when you haven’t bothered to bring a fishing rod.

They spend a lot of time on the internet, in forums where they complain about things like ""Chads""—men who are good at life—and ""Stacys,"" women who dare to have boyfriends. They might share stories of someone they saw at the gym, a ""Chad"" lifting weights and chatting to women, and how that guy is the sole reason they can’t find a girlfriend. It’s basically the grown-up version of sulking in your room, except now they can type long essays about why they deserve a girlfriend because they once held a door open for their nan.

The problem with incels is they think life is like a vending machine: you put in enough ""nice guy points,"" and sex is supposed to fall out. They’ll complain about buying someone a coffee or giving them a compliment, then fume when it doesn’t result in pants flying off. But relationships don’t work like that. They’re more like Ikea furniture—you have to put in effort, and even then, it might fall apart if you don’t follow the instructions.

Incels also have their own bizarre vocabulary, like they’re trying to sound more academic about being bitter. They talk about ""the black pill,"" which isn’t an actual pill but a depressing belief that the world is rigged against them. They’ll write posts about how ""women only date men over six feet tall,"" like all women carry measuring tapes around in their handbags. They even rank people’s attractiveness with something called a ""lookism scale,"" which sounds scientific until you realize it’s just an excuse to whinge about their jawlines while comparing themselves to Chris Hemsworth.

What’s strange is that they don’t seem to realize they’re the problem. They call themselves ""nice guys,"" but being nice isn’t just about saying “hello” without growling—it’s about empathy and treating people like humans, not objects in a game. Instead of trying to connect with others, they post long rants about how ""modern women"" are shallow because they like men with hobbies. The irony is, if they spent as much time improving themselves as they do complaining, they might not need a label at all.

Nowadays, life is not very friendly to me. I have been suffering from a general lack of joy in life and hobbies so I have been in search of things that will revive that little kid in me who likes to imagine, enjoy and play

Yesterday I was at the local book store just lookin around and saw Absolute Batman lying over there. The cover grabbed my interest so I said ""fuck it"" and picked it up. I came home and read it with a coffee. At the end, I realized I was smiling. I said to myself out loud ""wow I really enjoyed this shit"".

I went back to the store and bought every issue of Absolute Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. I also bought The Walking Dead because I was excited lol.

So I met my friend, who we will call “Tae” for this post, at work about 3-4 years ago. She was always a little “un-hinged.” Often late for work, partied a lot, hung out with some questionable people, etc. You get the point. Her and I took a liking to each other because, aside from her habits, she was a genuinely nice person and we could talk for hours on end. Back in 2022, her and I became closer than ever- we hung out multiple times a week and grew a nice bond. I was post breakup at this point, so I was open to being a little more sporadic with my time. Early 2022 (think April) she started hanging out with a group of people who were MUCH older than us. We were 20 at the time, and this new friend group was pushing their 40s. She was “dating” one of the guys (I say dating lightly because she didn't really like him, but he had money and gave her like some sort of stability). He was extremely controlling, manipulative, and abusive in many ways. She soon moved in with him. 
The new group of people were huge partyers, and I later found out that most of the men in the group were cheating on their wives and very mischievous. I was young and dumb, so I hung out with her and her new friends anyways. However, it wasn't too long before her “boyfriend” started commenting on my weight, the way I do my makeup, that I should “start doing porn” (weird I know), etc. His friends were equally disgusting in nature. Nearing September 2022, I was fed up with how her boyfriend made me feel, how he treated Tae, and how his friends acted, so I let her boyfriend know many times that I hate him and I never wanted to see him or his friends again (he tried to call me or text me to argue about Tae).  At the end of 2022, Tae got into a fight with her “boyfriend” and she ended up in the emergency room for 14 hours because he beat her up. I was in the hospital the entire time and helped her through it all. After that, she moved into her own apartment.

Some time passed by and I found out that she was seeing him again. In early 2023, she asked me to go to the bar with her for one of her friends birthdays. I said yes. When I showed up, one of her female friends from the older group (whom Ive always gotten along with) started to come at me and she tried to assault/ fight me more than 5 times. Eventually, i was worried for my safety so I left the bar. My friend, Tae, was very upset with her. We had no idea why she was trying to fight me. We later found out it was because the guy she thought she was seeing (the guy had NO interest in seeing her) saw me a few times in 2022 (it had been over a year since I saw him at this point). So she was trying to beat me up. This girls is known for starting fights at bars (shes 39 years old). 
Anyways, a few months go by and I invite Tae to go to a drag show with my other friend and I. Tae comes to my apartment and tells me how she and the girl who tried to beat me up just got back from “a weekend trip” to a different city together. I was shocked. After that, I cut distance. At the end of 2023, I asked Tae to go for coffee and I told her how it all made me feel. She profusely apologized and said she doesn’t know how to make friends properly or be a good friend (which I believe because she had a really traumatic upbringing). I told her that I need some time and that since I value loyalty, I don’t know how to feel. We didn’t hangout much after that. 
Cut to mid 2024, she didn’t text me on my birthday (which I was surprised about) and I found out from her social media that she was moved back in with the ex who beat her up. 
So, AITA for cutting ties? ",2,1735515580.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False
1hp99sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1hp99sl/german_guy_i_cant_figure_out/,German guy I can't figure out,"Hey up! I'm seeking some advice on the following: I met a German guy 10 years ago in another country and we hooked up a few times before he moved back to Germany. We started talking again recently when he learned I coincidentally would move to his city in Germany due to a new job. He has suggested we meet a few times over a period of two months (before and since my arrival) and I assumed he may be single. But he very casually dropped a ""find some time for my gf"" along a long to do list which included cleaning up his apartment a couple weeks ago. This is a bit odd, right? Appeared to minimize the relationship to me.

After this I simply said something like ""cool. Your life sounds good  I wish you happiness xx"" and he immediately responded asking my availability and invited me for coffee... I'm confused bc we don't actually need to see each other especially if he has a girlfriend. It's been 10 freaking years! Not sure I should go but kind feel curious to go. Maybe it's a rare case of him being reaaaally interested in me as a friend? A really unusual friendship but also I may be misunderstanding some cultural differences? I'd appreciate it if someone wants to help me understand this situation. 🙂 ",0,1735515579.0,germany,11,0.36,False

","If there is something that poets often praise after women, it would undoubtedly be winter—the season of creativity and melancholy. It inspires poets, casting shadows upon the tips of their pens. The sight of harsh cold, which makes one huddle up for warmth, the raindrops that knock against glass windows expressing themselves with pride, the warmth of the heater battling the room's chill, and the rising steam from a cup of coffee—all of these create a fitting scene for the poet and writer to pour out their thoughts, sharpened by the winter season.

However, not all poets view winter the same way. Some poets spend this season in tents worn down by the summer sun, and destroyed by the rain, tearing apart every poem they wrote in love of winter. Each of us has a different story with winter—whether it's a devout person rejoicing in the shortness of the day to fast as a cold bounty, or in the long night to stand in prayer; someone seeking stillness that allows their thoughts to wander freely; a lover of walking under the raindrops, rekindling memories of youthful play; another seeking the warmth of the family, enjoying the sight of loved ones gathering around for evening talks; a farmer hopeful that winter will bring the rain needed to irrigate the land. The list goes on.

But the picture is not always like this. As it is said, ""Everything is beautiful in winter, except for the shivering of the poor."" In Gaza, winter has another face— a harsh one, despised by those who die in their worn-out tents from the cold. In those tents, raindrops invade through the fragile roofs and under their feet.

The misery is worsened by the lack of food to provide energy, and the shortage of blankets that could provide some warmth. Mahmoud Darwish, when he called to Rita, ""Oh Rita, this winter is long,"" did not know that winter in Gaza is even longer, not because of love and passion, but due to the severity of the freezing cold and the madness of the winds. What good is there in a world where children die after their bodies freeze from the cold? Yes, in Gaza, children and the weak meet their end this way.

Let's try to explain the saying that winter in Gaza is harsher than enemy missiles. Yes, the people there have grown accustomed to the sights of bombardments—children play in the craters left by the shells, and people return to their tents after nearby airstrikes to look for a piece of bread and a cup of hot tea, as if nothing had happened. Some people deal with airstrikes with a 50/50 chance: either they are hit and become martyrs, or they survive and live whatever life remains. Others are more hopeful, believing they will always survive, as they have each time. For them, the fear of death from bombs is a worry for the future, not for the present.

As for winter, the suffering from its harshness is immediate, experienced by the people in the tents throughout the season. It kills them every moment, slowly draining their spirits. It offers no 50/50 chance; its severity snuffs out every hope in their hearts.

Two million displaced people have been living in tents for a year because of the aggression that destroyed three-quarters of buildings and facilities in Gaza. But the suffering has worsened, as 81% of these tents are now dilapidated, unable to protect their inhabitants from the dangers of cold and rain.

The picture is ugly, as ugly as it can be—there is no food, no fuel, no medicine, no blankets, no safety, even in areas that the occupiers claim are ""safe."" All this, combined with the harshness of winter. We have left the people of Gaza at the mercy of winter. We have abandoned them, and no one listens to the advice of Caliph Omar to the people of the Levant: ""Winter has arrived, and it is an enemy. Prepare for it with woolen clothes, socks, and blankets. Take wool as your shield and armor, for the cold is an enemy—quick to enter and slow to leave.""

We are not like Judge Abu Yusuf, who was concerned about protecting prisoners from the cold, requesting heavy clothing for them from Harun al-Rashid. Nor are we like Layth ibn Saad, who would feed people in winter with foods that provided them energy.

We stand before the suffering of the displaced in winter, weep, then stop, and eventually grow accustomed to it, forgetting. When we remember, we turn our eyes away to avoid crying again. Isn't this our reality?

The international community passes along news of the suffering in Gaza, warning of the dangers of winter, and then they speak of the difficulty of sending winter aid due to the obstinacy of the occupying authorities. No surprise, this is their usual way—double standards and hypocrisy.

But what truly breaks the heart is the Arab and Islamic world’s surrender to the intransigence of the occupation. A nation of billions cannot force these scavengers to allow aid that would save our people in Gaza. They leave blankets and winter supplies stranded for months, awaiting the occupiers’ approval to allow them into the sector. What disgrace has marked our foreheads!

I hesitated for a long time before writing these lines, as it is expected of a writer to not only narrate and present the problem but also propose solutions. But I am unable to do so. What solution can I offer when Gaza’s keys are in the hands of its enemy, who locks the doors and tightens the siege, confident that the Arab and Islamic world is passive, submissive, weak, and divided, incapable of forcing him to do anything, protected and under the care of the world’s greatest powers?

Nevertheless, I am overwhelmed by what I see, and I cannot bear the rush of these images and scenes in my mind without my pen moving. At the very least, I can stir the issue in people’s hearts and remind those who have forgotten. This is less than the death of the conscience.

But write, and speak, about the suffering of our people in Gaza during winter. Do not ignore their suffering. If it does not move governments, at least it will reach our brothers in Gaza, so they know that you are crushed and defeated, but that for their plight, you feel pain. Perhaps we will be like the Tabi’i (companion) Uways al-Qarni, who said: ""O Allah, I apologize to You for every hungry liver, and for every naked body. I have nothing except what is on my back and in my stomach.""

And Allah is the best disposer of affairs, but most people do not know.

1hp936q,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1hp936q/almost_1_week_post_op_my_experience_prior_surgery/,Almost 1 week Post Op. My experience prior surgery & post surgery.,"Dec 21- Around 7pm, I started feeling intense pain on my upper abdomen. I thought I may just have ate something bad. The pain became worse later at night. Took 2 Tylenols and pain would not subside. I could not sleep. 

Dec 22- I was awake until 6am because I was vomiting from midnight until 6am. I felt like I puked my entire guts out. The vomit eventually just became yellow. I could not keep liquids down. Every time I try to drink water, I immediately had to run to the bathroom to vomit. The abdominal pain was so severe that it was radiating to my back. I was hugging my heat pad to my stomach to help. Although I was in pain, I eventually fell asleep from exhaustion around 6am.
I woke up around 10am/11am & the pain still continued. I felt so dehydrated. Just stayed on my couch massaging my stomach & using my heating pad. Pain continued until night time. I finally texted my mom that I think I need to go to the ER.

Dec 23- I was rushed to the ER around 1am. They immediately took my blood, urine, CT scan, and ultrasound. I was officially diagnosed with acute cholecystitis & pancreatitis. My pancreatic enzymes was over 1000 when normal range is around 100. Doctor said my pancreas was more than likely inflamed because of the gallbladder. 
     Around 3:30am, I was officially admitted & got assigned my room at Med Surg unit. They gave me some meds / IV & waited for my pancreas to calm down before they do surgery. I was finally able to get some much needed sleep as well.
     Around 11am, I was finally brought down to the Pre-Op room to get me prepared for surgery. I was awake until I got to the surgery room & they put the gas mask on me. It didn’t take long for me to pass out. I remember waking up around 2pm with a tube down my throat. I pulled out the tube & waived the nurse down. I was still a bit drowsy but I remember asking the nurse if I could drink some matcha 😂 She gave me ice to suck on because my throat felt so dry.
      Around 3pm, I was brought back to my room at MedSurg & they gave me my late lunch (liquid diet). I remember swallowing the chicken noodle soup so quick because I haven’t eaten in days. Doctor came to see me not long after to tell me everything was looking good & that I could be discharged tomorrow before Christmas eve. I just needed to pass gas & try to walk as much as I can. I had no problem with this as I practically kept farting after I finally had something to eat. The 4 incisions they did on my stomach was a bit painful at first but I was able to get up & walk around just fine with some pain meds.

Dec 24- The doc switched me to low fat diet for lunch before discharging me to see how I feel. I had baked chicken with mashed potatoes & carrots. No issues, no pain. I was discharged around 2pm & was able to go home.

For Christmas eve dinner, I had Filipino Beef & Vegetable stew with rice (similar to Caldo De Res). I was able to eat this with no issues. 

Dec 25 to today Dec 29— I have been eating a mixture of Chicken Noodle Soup, Loaded Baked Potato soup, Baked chicken, beef, tilapia, smoked sausage, rice, eggs, wheat bread, wheat bagel, Japanese sponge cake but all in small portions. No issues or stomach ache so far. I do not drink coffee but I do make my own matcha at home. I have been drinking 4 grams of matcha every morning with low fat oat milk. No issues there as well. 
     Pooping— I have been taking stool softener which was prescribed by doctor. No issues there as well. I’ve been able to poop twice successfully. 
     Sleeping— I’ve been sleeping slightly sitting up & last night I was finally able to sleep laying down. Although, it is a bit painful if I lay on the side so I must remain laying flat for now.
     Urination— I feel like I have to go to the bathroom more frequently now. I probably need to go pee every hour or two. Possibly because of the effects of anesthesia on my body but I guess we will see down the road. 
     Shortness of breath— I’ve noticed I been getting shortness of breath. I do rest and do some breathing exercises when I notice. Possibly because of the intubation during surgery? I will bring this up with my doctor during the 2 week check up.

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

The depth of flavors are amazing and the guided brew is a dream. I'll of course play more with the different options and settings, but straight out the packaging and this little black box is my favorite thing.

I also pruchased (based on Ratio's recommendations) the Able stainless steel, reusable filters (Kone mini for single cup and flat bottom for carafe). I knew the flat bottom would work perfectly, but was worried about the Kone mini...and boy was I pleasantly surprised.

While making coffee, I had forgotten about what I'm doing in the game. After several minutes, I come back to a death screen. I check the combat log - I had drowned. Turns out during the following I had gotten into water with Underwater Breathing buff, but as it run out, I drowned.

1hp8ybf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hp8ybf/aio_for_getting_upset_about_my_parents_constantly/,AIO for getting upset about my parents constantly arguing? ,"Firstly, I want to start this off to acknowledge the privilege that I have of having both parents in my life. And for anyone wondering, I am 20 years old. 

But I just feel so exhausted of the constant bickering, dude. My mother started to vent to me personally about my father when I was about 15-16. Told me things like, “I hope you never end up like your father, he’s a dickhead, I do not love him anymore” etc. When I was younger I did not see an issue with it because I just wanted to support my mom and help her feel listened to. 

But, the older I’ve gotten, the more I feel like this shit is never going to stop. They have been in an unhappy marriage since I was about 9-10 years old and I knew what was going on. When they start going back and forth it literally transports me back to that little girl, who always tried to mediate everything and “fix everything” between the two of them. 

I got triggered yesterday really bad in particular due to the dumbest situation. It is christmas time and I am home for the holidays. My father got my mother a bird feeder with a camera, and originally she loved it. NOW, she suddenly said to my father that she “didn’t ask for it” and would like him to return it… because the squirrels might get onto it. My mother LOVES birdwatching. They have bird feeders in the garden. She literally loved the gift at first and then changed her mind. 

And then she immediately started texting me after the argument, telling me that everyone is trying to make her feel bad. 

When I got her a pandora bracelet for her birthday, she did not say “thank you”, she complained about it “looking too small” and was being so damn negative. My father got her a yeti coffee mug, because she LOVES mugs and drinks coffee and tea regularly, and the same line arose: 

“Well, I’ll never use this. I didn’t ASK for it.” 

They get into stupid arguments like this, and have, my entire life. If I told my mother or my father that I didn’t “ask” for one of my christmas gifts, do you know how quickly I would have gotten scolded? Do you know how quickly my mother in particular, would have called me an ungrateful brat? 

I think she is clearly in an unhappy marriage and she has always vented her frustrations to me about how she really dislikes my father. She even got on my case more than a few times, saying that I “act like him” for taking a nap, for example. A nap. 

My father is not perfect, either. He shuts down emotionally and does not communicate, and sometimes he can be mean back to her. They are both in their 50’s, however, and I just CANNOT handle the constant back and forth, they act like literal 12 year olds at times. 

I feel guilty, because a part of me wants to separate myself from the family and another part still loves them and understands that they could be just frustrated with eachother and act petty to get it out of their system. 

I have came to a point where I have gotten so angry at their behavior that it makes me blood boil. And I am angry for basically being my mother’s therapist before I even knew what marriage was. I love my parents, I’m sure I always will, but I do not like them sometimes.

1hp8xjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/1hp8xjp/adhesion_issues/,Adhesion issues,"Had my ender 3 v2 since last year. The first few months I had it, it worked great. Had some extra PLA but stopped printing at the end of a spool because I was getting ready to move and didn't know when I'd be able to monitor prints. 

Took the printer out and had it reset up with the glass bed and had slight adhesion issues. Wasn't sure if it was because of humidity, or not being on the most stable surface. At the time I had it set up in a different room so monitoring prints was difficult. Ended up switching the glass bed out for an original creality magnetic sheet that I had. There were bubbles in the magnet and I didn't want to deal with it at the time thinking it hopefully caused minimal issues. Also got an enclosure and a standalone coffee table for it all to sit on and tried it. 

Still was having adhesion issues. Family member gave me a gift card for amazon so I used it to get a dry box and am still having adhesion issues Got the box yesterday, rewashed the print surface with soap and water and let it dry. Rechecked the bed level and z offset and was trying to run a levelling test (thingiverse thing 6173762 200-220 9 point) after wiping off any oils with isopropyl alcohol.

I can't use sprays because the person I live with is sensitive to them and i'm trying to avoid using glue sticks if I can. 

I'm willing to return to/try a replacement glass bed as well. Just frustrated it worked fine until I stopped using it for awhile. 

Any help/advice on a decision would be greatly appreciated",1,1735514609.0,ender3,0,0.6,False

I met Gabrielle when we were in middle school. We became friends-- not super close, but we'd hang out a lot in school. We both had our post-puberty glow ups at around the same time and grew closer. After a misunderstanding that led to me not speaking to her for a year and lumping her in with the ""loser"" group (I was a bit of a jerk in general in high school) that got excluded from everything, we reconnected towards the end of that year. We ended up dating for a few months before I cheated on her and pretty much ghosted. I haven't seen her since.

Our mutual high school friend had coffee with her yesterday because they happened to be in the same city. He gossiped to me afterwards, naturally. She's doing well, which was good to hear. She did express that she hated how that year went, which wasn't surprising. However, the unexpected part: they did talk a fair bit about me, and she was actually really complimentary.

Apparently:

* She ""regrets"" that our relationship ended and wishes that she'd done better and that I'd understood that she was trying (this confused me, I really didn't think that much of it at the time)
* She said that she remembers me as a really nice guy and that I could be amazing, but that I'd also push buttons and could be an absolute dick. She expressed that ""you just have to accept him for who he is because he knows he's like that.""
* She asked about me, how I was doing, and whether I was seeing anyone (I think she was just curious lol)

I don't have any residual feelings for her (I haven't known her for over eight years), but I do feel weirdly bad after hearing all this-- almost makes me wish I'd been a little nicer!",2,1735514596.0,confessions,2,1.0,False

I am a 50-something ex-CIO who took this test basically for my ego AND bc I have to  jump into the  resume grinder to find another job soon.  

I have about 15 years of direct industry experience and prior to management did all sorts of work including setting up full 365 tenants, tons of Exchange to 365 migrations, nationwide Fortigate deployments, Watchguard, Sonicwall, Crowdstrike, Huntress, Sentinel One, Hyper-V, VMWare, MDT, server hardware, HPE/Cisco switching, Unifi, Aerohive, Powershell, AD/GPO, MS CSP, MDM, 365 DLP, Entra, corporate security policy, SOC audits, PCI DSS, etc etc.  You name it, I’ve done it - EXCEPT software stuff. I didn’t know Agile from Six Sigma and now know all I’ll ever want to. 

Anyway, after leaving my previous company and updating my LinkedIn (which I loathe, TERRIBLY) for the first time in forever, I saw this guy from a CPA firm who used to do our SOC Audits had his CISSP. I was SHOCKED.  At that point I said man, if he can do it, I sure as hell better be able to do it. 

I intentionally threw down the gauntlet to myself and started this whole thing the last week of November and gave myself a max of 30 days to do it. I scheduled the test 28 days out and told everyone I ran into (at Christmas parties etc) I was taking it and bragged to my wife that I could get this cert faster than most of my fellow tech nerds…solely to put massive pressure on myself.  She was DEFINITELY holding me to it.  Admittedly I over prepared and threw a lot of $$ at it (mainly for the ISC2 bootcamp).  That was an easy decision though bc failure was not an option.  I had to put my money where my big ass mouth was.  

I blazed thru the Chapelle videos at 2x and read/Audibled the OSG for a couple of weeks then jumped into one of the ISC bootcamps at the last minute on Dec 16th.  The boot camp was great but I don’t think it was 100% necessary. It was just 40 hours of focused study time and I looked at as insurance (lest my bragging crash and burn me). The teacher was a real inspiration and absolutely reinforced many of the tips you hear in this sub and elsewhere but I think I could have passed without it. 

I sprinkled in PocketPrep, Learnzapp, Wiley etc throughout.  Had those things running non-stop. Studied my ass off. I probably put in 125-150 Hours altogether. I pretty much grabbed every piece of study material I could find.

**PRIMARY RESOURCES**

r/CISSP. - 11/10 !  This place is AWESOME.  There are a few a-holes here but it’s not nearly as bad as some other forums I’m on : )

**Mike Chappelle LinkedIN videos** 10/10 - started here.  EXCELLENT EXCELLENT way to get your bearings. Seriously, I'd watch this whole thing  at 1.5-2x (like all videos except Coffee Shots) before reading the OSG and THEN dig into that. It helps frame up the whole thing.  This goes very quickly and I swear it got me 50% of the way there.

**Learnzapp and PocketPrep** \- 10/10.  I learn well this way.  When I missed questions I would just learn about what I missed.  And the scoring/stats…It’s called GAMIFICATION folks as I now know!  These two are the best at it and the convenience and constant ability to learn on the go and at stoplights or on the John and MEASURE PROGRESS were priceless ; )

81% overall readiness on LZ. I did not do any questions twice.  That’s just one straight run thru the entire thing - every domain.  I'd watch Chapelle linked in first though.  2200+ questions answered.  Did about 700 of the pocket prep q’s and had 86% all in.  People say PP Is too easy but you should do the “level up” sections and just wait until you get to level 5 or 6 in each subject.  Some RIDICULOUS questions in there. But most of what I did was the ‘easy’ questions and it was vital to help me learn the concepts.  Also,the pocket prep answers are great bc they point you directly to the OSG.

I think it’s important for people not to fool themselves on readiness due to simply repeating questions they’e already attempted.  Gotta be careful of that in Learnzapp, PPrep and Wiley.

**OSG Paper Copy** 1/10 - This book was awful. Not the material.  The material was great but there was no possible way I was reading that whole MF one page at a time.  FAHHHK that.  First off the book is too heavy and  too floppy for being so heavy. Next, you need it with you all the time. Back and forth to work?  No thanks. And my BIGGEST gripe with the book was how long it took to ‘look up’ something. Say you need more info about Risk Frameworks.  Well, go to the index, it’s listed 20 times on 20 different pages.  You will spend hours just turning pages and tracking shit down. I ended up shelving that thing.

**OSG Kindle Version** 8/10 - would be a 9 or 10 but the Kindle app is kinda MEH. But the absolute key is being able to search quickly. The OSG is the course Bible.  It’s got everything you need and is mostly  well done.  If I ordered no other version it would probably be this one.

**OSG Amazon Audible version** \- 9/10. This is the only way I could get thru all that material. Listened to it at 1.75 or 2.0x while blowing leaves and listened to several sections multiple times. Available at office, home laptop and phone.  Only way to go.

**Wiley/OSG tests** 7.5/10. Decent material and questions.  They need more questions in that bank. Overlaps with Learnzapp but that’s actually a great way to discover whether you actually learned the concept bc a lot of times just seeing the same question in different font/format makes a big difference.

Scores;  73, 80, 68, 79 (test 3 was a PITA)

**Certpreps 8/10** \- they say it’s AI Trash.  I thought it was very good.  If it's stolen, shame on them.  Still helped me though.

71, 68, 74, 75, 82

**ChatGPT**  10/10 - man you kids in school don’t know how lucky you are to have this.   It was supremely valuable. It’s like having a personal tutor.  Even better.  Amazing.  

**Pete Zerger Exam Cram and (especially) the 2024 Addendum** 10/10 - I didn’t really realize the value of this until late  I’d probably START with Zerger materials next time (after Chappelle vids).

I finished up the 8 hr exam cram on Friday morning and listened to the Zerger 2024 addendum on the way to the test center.  I had at least three questions DIRECTLY from that 2024 addendum. Should have spent more time on Zerger.  He brings a lot of things together better than most. I didn’t really dig into his stuff until the last few days before the exam. 

I would also focus on the **ISC2 official test OUTLINE**.  For example, there was a bunch of stuff in my ISC2 bootcamp that wasn’t on the outline. Old outdated security models etc.  These were in some of the VIDEOS as well like the Zerger 2021 video.  For example:  SYSTEM HIGH MODE.  The word is not mentioned ONCE in the entire OSG.  I would just skip it.  Graham Denning is another one not in the OSG.  At the very least I have to assume the CAT is not going to dig in on those.   If it’s not in the OSG one single time…you gotta figure it’s unlikely to be a focus on the test.  

**SECONDARY RESOURCES** 

I got mixed value out of these.  No number grade. I don’t believe in leaving bad reviews, especially when these have helped so many.  I just clicked with the stuff above more.

Prabh Coffee Shots - Prabh’s  data owner/controller/business owner video was awesome.  What he and Zerger do better than many is helping translate ISC test-speak.  Like the delineation between ACCOUNTABLE and RESPONSIBLE and equating the generic term ‘information’ to ‘data’.  There’s a LOT of that word salad on the test - where they use words or descriptions you have never heard of to refer to data, information, CIA or a certain process.  Word tricks.  They can say it ain’t trix but I respectfully disagree.   

Dest Cert Concise Guide.  This book was really good, but I should have gotten it earlier. I just didn’t end up using it that much.

Dest Cert Mind Maps - didn’t click with me. I tried them.  Too many white blocks.  They needed some color coding or something. 

Dest Cert Subject Videos - These were pretty good. I didn’t watch all of them.  

**QE** \-   I did about 1/2 of the questions altogether.  A week before the exam I took a 100q quiz and got a 54 and put it away forever.   other than that 54 I was scoring in the 30s and 40s all the time.   QE confused me more than anything.  I respect those who love it but I am already an exceptionally analytical reader and began questioning my own logic and ability to reason which has served me well for my entire career.  Not saying QE is not logical or isn’t a good resource.  It just wasn’t for me. Regardless, it is impossible to deny the tremendous contribution that DH brings to this community and frankly, QE appeals to MOST other people here.  So it’s not you Q .E.  It’s M.E. !   I would suggest you purchase it for yourself and make your own call. 

Luke Ahmed How to think like a manager kindle version (only 9.99).  it’s 25 questions.  I feel the same way I did about QE.  Data Point:  I got about 8 of 25 correct about 4 days before the test.  I thought the explanations left me with no additional reasoning skills. Explanations made sense, but weren’t going to help me get better.  Like, if I saw 1000 questions like that and studied my ass off I would still not improve.  Just made me doubt myself more.   I know my relative level of intelligence.  Unless the entire candidate pool of CISSP takers has a 1500 SAT brain, then the real test won’t be nearly this bad or NOBODY would pass.  I did like a few of Luke’s other things but neither this or QE seemed to help me make progress my. In fact, they both made me doubt my instincts which proved to be strong enough.

In the end I am proud to have passed and to have the cert especially with the memory of a 50-something...which is a REAL thing youngsters. As a kid, I only had to read things a couple of times.  Not any more!   I think the body of knowledge is amazing. I loved learning about all the different topics and this filled in a lot of holes I'd always wondered about.  LOVED the cryptography/certificate stuff.

My biggest gripe with this whole program is a lot of this stuff is so much what I would call ‘textbook knowledge’ geared toward corporate managers in extremely large enterprises with MASSIVE funds who don't know the impact of saying something like ""install a NIDS""

The book and materials throw around terms like HIDS and NIDS like they are a Netgear Router you buy at Microcenter and plug into your switch.  What they don’t tell you is that you need a vendor trained superstar who knows how to size, license, configure and optimize that NIDS…and it’s not necessarily a single box…and you may already have that capability in your UTM and it very well may cost several small fortunes.. Nor did they mention how INCREDIBLY expensive SIEMs are and that even in a ‘small’ business with $30MM of revenue, the owner is likely going to tell you to pound sand when you propose a $2000 a month SEIM.  You want to implement a formal policy change in a rapid acquisition roll up of 50 man companies?  Good luck getting the sales guys at the company you bought to stop collecting credit apps full of PII via email on MSWord Templates like they’ve been doing for 15 years and making TONS of money doing it. YES, they’ve been compromised multiple times.  Yes, it has cost them money.  But they’ve made a LOT more than they have lost.  In my experience, proposing a change in procedures for security purposes often involves providing a new business process solution.  Probably doesn't happen in large, mature organizations with tried and true practices but n the 1000 and below employee size company...it's every day.  it's a whole different risk appetite profile.  

Bottom line is that they need to teach that Risk Acceptance and Risk Appetite vary a LOT more than you might imagine.

I also think this course would have been much better suited integrating some more real world examples like Intune, M365 Conditional Access Policies (the ultimate ABAC example - Zerger does a much better job of this) and some other, more in depth vendor-specific, modern examples. 

Another gripe about the test itself is all the aforementioned word salad bullshit (which is dumb) that does nothing to determine your grasp of the material OR assess your abilities as a manager vs a tech. It tests whether you are smart enough to decode ISC speak. Apparently I am.  Good on me.

I’m a native English speaker with a relatively high functioning vocab. I cannot FATHOM trying to take this not in my native language. If I have mastered the material, have already been in a professional position for years where I have practiced the exact activities I THINK you are trying to ask me about, and I can deconstruct this question and am SURE I know the domain and the answer, and these three answers I KNOW are wrong, but this 4th one? what the AF is a “\_\_\_\_\_” -  a term II have never heard of in all my years of professional practice.  What is that assessing?  My ISC2 word salad decoding skills.  Pop the cork I guess.

So…test day.  I actually like taking tests and doing puzzles and crosswords and just wanted to get it done to see if had the chops.  I can’t imagine being much more prepared.  I had to drive 90 min to the test center for a 3pm test.  i got delayed by fog/traffic on the way and my 45 min advance arrival had dwindled to 21 min so I was cutting it WAY close. 

The place was a little depressing but I guess it is about what I expected.  They only wanted one ID (were strangely adamant about that) and scanned my hands no fewer than half a dozen times each.

I wasn’t a deer in the headlights on Q1 but the questions got difficult in a hurry.  I would read a question a couple of times and just say look, if I can ’t figure this out after all this study…I’m not sweating it.  So that’s a beta or I am just throwing it away.  Wasn’t going to waste 3 min figuring it out.   These were the questions where I couldn’t eliminate a single answer.   I made sure I wasn’t missing something obvious, took a crack and moved on quickly. 

I took some calculated gambles.  Big ones, tbh.  Narrowed to two on a few and chose answers I considered ‘aggressive’.  I am sure some of those were beta questions.  Not sure that’s what worked but I did it anyway and tried to keep my time in check. I think I did 47 questions in the first hour. That was pretty close to  the pace I needed to do 150 in 180.  I also selected a couple of answers solely with the ‘these 3 look alike, the 4th looks different, that must be it' method.

I think I missed the first 1-2 SAML/Oauth/OpenID questions bc the CAT got after my ass on that topic.  I’ve set that shit up myself and paid people to set it up so many times it makes my head spin. Yet I have never bothered to understand it at such a deep level. I studied it and understood a lot….but not to the level they were asking. One of them HAD to be a beta.  Think like a manger wasn't helping here.  I went with my gut on a few of those and finally it left me alone.

There is no possible way I got 70 of those 100 questions correct.  No POSSIBLE way. I bet I got 50 of them correct.  Actually that makes sense now.  Out of the first 100, you get 75 real questions so I guess 53 questions gets you to 70% so maybe I got 53. But I hear that some questions are worth more than others so who knows. 

I was very eager to get to 100 bc I wanted to leave and not be there for 3 hours so I was hoping to God I’d pass at 100.  I paused before clicking the 100th answer knowing that it if ended, I was home free.  It’s just that the test was so tricky and I knew my capabilities and felt good enough about my prep and benchmarks that there was no way I was FAILING at 100.  So…stopping at 100 meant passing.  So when it stopped I knew I was good. I may or may not have grabbed a beer or two before driving home.  

Again huge huge thanks to everyone on this sub.  In my ISC2 training camp I told everybody in there to get their butts over here.  Probably TWO people in that group of 40 were even aware of it.  I would have never even undertaken this if not for this sub.

Best of luck to all of you and God help you ESL folks.  Wurd Salad is Ruwd ; )

1hp8v7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hp8v7f/i_26f_got_back_with_my_longterm_boyfriend_27m/,I (26F) got back with my longterm boyfriend (27M) after he cheated. Did I make a mistake as can't stop thinking about someone else?,"Me and my boyfriend got together in 2015, we were each others first serious relationship, he was my first everything, and I ultimately believed in the fairytale happy ending for us. I appreciate this was naive of me but I was in love and knew no better. For the first year of being together I don't remember any major arguments or reasons to mistrust him, I never doubted him because I never had any reason to, he made me feel like the most loved and special person alive. I remember the first time I discovered that I wasn't the only girl he had eyes for, I had been visiting him at uni at found messages with another girl online. She was in another country so I knew it was only talk, nothing physical. And so after confronting him about it, and there being lots of tears and emotions on both our behalves, I let it go and we moved on.

Over the years there were many more instances of discovering messages to different girls online. Each time there'd be another excuse, each time I stretch the boundaries just that little bit more and say this was the last time I'd put up with it. It never was the last time, I couldn't walk away from him. My home life wasn't/isn't particularly good, and whilst my relationship with him wasn't particularly strong at this point, I craved the stability and familiarity that he brought.

Up until 2022 I Had truly believed that nothing more had ever happened than online interactions. I was wrong. Days before our anniversary I remember seeing her name pop up on his phone, a WhatsApp from that he was quick to swipe away. I had this feeling in my stomach but I said nothing and chose to ignore it. Despite this, he fired away excuse of how ""she's someone I work with"" ""she's a lesbian its nothing like that"". I hadn't asked so I thought maybe it could've been true since he'd told me unprompted. But sometimes you just know, you get that sinking feeling in your stomach that convinces you otherwise. I'm not ashamed to admit I looked at his phone that night. She wasn't a lesbian, she was the girl he'd been spending all his time with while working away (military). They would go to each others rooms to watch tv and play video games and texted the way one does when entering a new relationship, when everything is flirty and lovely. I confronted him, he broke down. He admitted they had kissed but swore blind it was nothing more. I wasn't convinced and we ended up taking a break for a few months. Despite not being together, we still spoke everyday, sometimes menial chit chat and sometimes emotional and raw conversations that would leave me shaking in tears questioning how I could still love this man and why I wasn't enough. You probably won't be surprised to hear we ended up back together, you'll probably be even less surprised to hear that I later found out it was in fact more than a kiss. This revelation actually came from the other woman who's number I had obtained from his phone. She confirmed it had gone the whole way, when he had visited her flat after they no longer worked together. He vehemently denied sleeping with her until January 2024, until he eventually caved and told me things had gone further than the initial kiss he admitted to.

We fell back into another period of not being in a relationship yet still talking almost daily still. During this time I decided to try dating apps as I had only know being with my boyfriend up to this point. I hated it, I didn't connect with any of those men and found it to be an experience that was boring and meaningless. Other than meeting someone for a coffee, nothing further ever happened.

However, I did start to develop a bit of a crush during this time on a coworker. I had been working alongside them for about a year at this point and had always thought they were good looking and got along quite well with them. Until now I had never really considered them as anything more than a coworker, but I now found myself putting more effort in on day when I knew I would see them, or I would get to work a little earlier for to have a chat with them. There was even a night where we went for a drink after a shift (not an unusual occurrence, myself and a few coworkers often would go after a tough shift), and afterwards he walked me to the car to make sure I got back safe. From that point on, I was smitten, but convinced it was all in my head and there was no way he would ever be remotely interested in me. My self-esteem was shattered after years of having the man I loved go behind my back to other woman.

A few months passed and there was a work night out to celebrate an occasion. Everyone attended and the drinks were flowing, and we were all having a great time dancing the night away. At some point a remixed version of a pretty sad song plays and somehow I've found myself in a half dance-half hug with the coworker. The song ends and we end up stood off to the side away from the group, it was clear that the dance had been more than just a dance. It was at this point he leaned down and whispered over the music that he liked me, like really liked me. It turned to a kiss. It turned to many a kiss that night, but nothing more. We proceeded to chat over texts and even went on a couple of dates over a couple of weeks. I couldn't believe it was actually happening, and I really enjoyed the time we spent together. We had stuff in common and the conversation flowed easily. I felt like I could be myself and it was enough, he was happy to be there with me.

So you're probably wondering if it was so great what happened? Well, like I said I was still talking to the original boyfriend. He got inside my head, talking about how he knew he'd messed, how he loved me and how great I was but he hadn't appreciated it. The real kicker; He told me how he'd almost bought a ring a few months and spoken to his mum about it. All I had believed in for the last 8/9 years was that I was going to spend the rest of my life with this man and that was what was supposed to make me happy. I found myself back with him and told the coworker that I couldn't continue seeing him as my head wasn't in it. This all happened in May 2024.

Fast forward to now, December 2024. I've been back with the original guy since May and haven't talked to the coworker since (I now work in a different location, irrelevant to this whole situation). So why do I still think about him most days? I'm not happy with my boyfriend because I have zero trust in him. It has been shattered over the years and there's not really been a massive amount of effort to change that. We are supposed to looking to move in together in the New Year. Can I remain in a relationship I'm pretty sure I cannot be fully happy in and don't feel as though I can be myself for the sake of financial security and stability.

Part of me really wants to reach out the the guy I worked with and apologise. I don't know why, it wouldn't achieve anything I'm sure. But I want him to know I'm sorry that I hurt him. That he managed to make me feel so happy, appreciated and comfortable in those couple of weeks. I miss him and I often find myself wondering about what could have been and how things would be different.

Basically I'm stuck between the old classic of head or heart. I'm putting it out to strangers on the internet because my friends all have pretty strong opinions on the situation and they also know the coworker guy so it's a bit awkward. Plus writing on here is cheaper than therapy I suppose haha.

TLDR: I (26F) stayed with my ex (27M) despite being cheated on and now I think I made a mistake by not giving it a fair go with someone else after we broke up temporarily. Debating what my future should hold.

I feed some stray cats at the coffee shop next to my work and today I sadly found the intestines, lungs, and roof of the mouth of one of the younger cats (I believe) that recently showed up. Was the cause of death natural and then vultures came to eat the body and they don’t eat those parts? Or was it killed while still alive? It weird that these specific organs are all separate and there’s no blood or anything that I see. I’m hoping it died of natural causes then was eaten rather than brutally murdered by an alligator or something. (I live in an alligator heavy part of Florida so that would be one possibility but I think gators just eat whatever whole like I don’t think they’re picking out specific parts they don’t like)

I’m considering shaving my head because I’m losing my mind.

I wanted him to spend time with his son, who lives in Japan (his ex-wife is Japanese and moved there with him). So, we called my mom to come help with the animals and other household tasks. She’s disabled but can assist me in watching everyone. However, she ended up having a urinary tract infection (UTI) that made her confused and disoriented. I didn’t know she had it, and neither did she until I took her to the doctor. She wanted to express her gratitude by organizing my kitchen without my permission. While I was asleep, she took out everything from every cabinet, leaving the kitchen and living room looking like a hoarder’s house. I’m trying to stay focused on my work and not let my emotions get the best of me. I told her that her gesture was appreciated but that I didn’t want her to do it again because I’m disorganized and don’t know where anything is. She responded, “Oh, it’s my pleasure. Don’t worry, I’ll put it all back.” I’m trying to control my emotions, so I’m letting her do it since everything is in disarray now, and I have no idea where anything is.

Then, I received a call from my brother, who’s managing my salon in another state. He informed me that all the stylists have quit and stolen our client list, leaving him in a state of panic and despair. I tried to stay calm and composed, telling him to stop crying. These things happen when one stylist quits; their friends often follow suit. He should have learned how to groom a year ago, but he didn’t, so now he has to earn his own wage instead of relying on the groomers to pay his way. I had to be the strong one and control my intrusive thoughts, which were telling me to scream at him and call him an idiot. But deep down, I’m completely losing my mind. 

Then, I received a call from my employees at my coffee shop informing me that two of their children had been admitted to the emergency room due to a flu-like illness. They had kindly covered their shifts in their own time, which I truly appreciated. However, it was just one more unexpected challenge to add to my already overwhelming workload.

On top of all this, my husband requested that I stay up until 3 a.m. so that he could reach me when he’s in Japan. While I had been happily accommodating this request for the past few days, I am now completely exhausted and will have to refrain from speaking on the phone for the next few days. I genuinely need the sleep, as our son wakes me up at 7 a.m., and I go to bed at almost 4 a.m. I simply cannot sustain this current schedule any longer.

I am proud of myself for not resorting to outbursts or excessive emotional outbursts that would be unproductive or detrimental. Nevertheless, I feel like I am gradually losing my composure and am on the verge of emotional exhaustion. So, I suppose I’ll conclude this rant here. ",5,1735513596.0,Vent,4,1.0,False

Last year, I became friends with a guy (16m), let’s call him mat, and mat and another friend of mine (16f), let’s call her Sarah, have been a trio together. I’ve always viewed our relationship as nothing more than a friendship. 
Mat is one of my only friends who really knows stuff about me, we always hang out every time I get back to my home country. Personally, I realized that I’ve always felt like I was attracted to him but I suppressed it.
A few days ago, we decided we should work out together, and we went to the gym. It was really fun (and turns out he’s a lot stronger than he seems haha). Afterwords, we went to a coffee shop and drank some coffee, I started complaining about my love life to him and he gave me tons of advice ( I’m probably being delusional but at some point he told me “you should befriend the guy before starting to try things out with him” and I responded “I wanna find the right guy for me” and he looked at me in a way that said “I am”)The conversation got deeper and I started talking about my personal life and family problems and he gave me wonderful advice. I always knew that he was smart, but his maturity level is beyond what I expected. And then we took a pic together, and before he got home, we hugged, this time it was longer than our previous hangouts. 
Honestly, I realized my feelings for him not a long time ago and I’m scared: first I don’t wanna ruin our friendship, and I don’t wanna lose him over this, so I gotta be careful. Second is that I’m scared of how smart he is, usually I go after guys I know I’m smarter than so I can control and predict what will happen, but with him, I can’t. I’ve been hurt many times by guys and I don’t know if I can give my trust that easily.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

South Korea is of my top 3 destinations, and I'm one click away from purchasing plane tickets to go there march-april 2025 (option 1: from march 23 to April 10 - 19 full days , option 2: march 28 night to April 13 - 16 full days). 

This would be not only my first solo trip (female, 26 years) but also big trip - I'm coming from Europe and up until now the biggest flight I took was like 3h max. 
I'll probably be staying 16 full days (+ arrival day) and would like to visit Seoul, Busan, Gyongju, and  Jeju (still not 100% sure about Jeju). 

I've drafted a plan/ list of stuff to see on the different cities, as well as the amount of time I'm thinking of staying in each one (picture).

In Seoul I was thinking to stay maybe 4/5 full days, then head to the other cities, and come back for the remaining 2/3 to give me a brake of the city and also because I would need to catch the flight back home. 

I would gladly welcome suggestions and opinions about my draft. Is there something I should include/ exclude? 
Do you have suggestions of bars, caffes,  stores, etc, maybe where I could meet other solo travellers?
Also, do you recommend any lodgings or areas to look for accomodation? 

On another note, I also some questions regarding: 
- eSim or physical card
- does Revolut work there 
- would I need a credit card 

I really appreciate any help you could give me!

I wake up each day wrapped in the calm certainty that life is everything I’ve ever dreamed of and more. The love of my life sleeps soundly beside me, his peaceful face lit by the soft morning light streaming through our open windows. I smile, feeling an overwhelming sense of gratitude that he entered my life so effortlessly—so naturally. He’s not just my partner; he’s my best friend, my confidant, and the most joyful part of my world.

Monday:
Our mornings begin with the simplest of rituals: coffee in our courtyard. The air is fresh, a gentle 70 degrees, as we sit at our wooden table surrounded by blooming flowers and vines. The laughter starts early, with his quick wit and our playful banter. We talk about our day ahead, but it never feels like planning; it feels like dreaming aloud.

The morning flows seamlessly into a session in my favorite room—our yoga and Pilates sanctuary. The sunlight pours in, illuminating the lush green plants that thrive here. I roll out my mat, stretch deeply, and feel connected to myself, my body, and the serene rhythm of our life.

By the afternoon, I’m at our home office, tending to our business and properties. It’s satisfying but never overwhelming. We have created systems that allow us to thrive without overworking. Even during tasks, there’s joy in knowing we’re building something meaningful together.

Dinner is simple yet decadent: fresh vegetables and herbs from our garden. We dine outside again, under string lights, with the sound of crickets in the background.

Wednesday:
Midweek feels like its own celebration. After a morning walk through the farmer’s market, where I pick up fresh bread and berries, I spend the afternoon reading in our garden. The birds chirp, the breeze dances lightly, and I marvel at how beautiful life feels when you slow down enough to savor it.

The evening is for us. We soak in our underground hot tub, the warm water melting away any tension. We talk about the books we’re reading, our plans for the future, and silly “what if” scenarios that keep us laughing for hours.

Friday:
We host one of our famous dinner parties. The table is set with candles and flowers from our garden. Friends arrive, filling the air with joy and laughter. After a delicious meal, we find ourselves deep in philosophical conversation over glasses of wine. Someone puts on a record, and soon we’re dancing under the stars.

The night ends with a feeling of connection—not just to each other but to our incredible circle of friends and the life we’ve built.

Saturday:
The weekend is for adventure. Sometimes, we take spontaneous trips, but today we stay close to home, hiking nearby trails and stopping to admire the views. Being surrounded by nature fills me with an indescribable peace.

Later, we volunteer at a local community garden. Giving back has become an integral part of our life, and it feels incredible to contribute to something bigger than ourselves.

Sunday:
The calmest day of the week. We spend the morning listening to records, making breakfast, and dancing in the kitchen. I water the plants in our yoga room, appreciating how much this space reflects the life we’ve created: vibrant, alive, and full of light.

In the evening, we sit in the courtyard, watching the sunset, his hand in mine. I feel immense gratitude for this life—this love, this home, this balance. It’s not just a dream anymore; it’s my reality.

And every night as I fall asleep, I whisper a quiet thank you to the universe for aligning so beautifully. My life is proof that joy, love, and abundance flow effortlessly when you trust the process.",1,1735513410.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False

1hp8h8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SASSWitches/comments/1hp8h8x/cocktailmaking_spells_rituals/,Cocktail-making spells & rituals?,"Hi all ✨️ I want to start adding some witchy intention and meaning to my evening cocktail routine. After all, what is a cocktail but a mind-altering potion featuring a variety of hetbs, spices, and fruits? And alcohol itself is thousands of years old and associated with numerous cultures. Plus it's a good opportunity to mark the transition from all the resposibilities of daytime to evening relaxation time!  I've seen posts on here about adding witchy elements to coffee & tea preparation, so I was wondering if anyone had experimented with cocktails, as well? What does that look like for you?

I'm just starting to brainstorm what this might look like for me, but so far I'm thinking it could be interesting to stir cocktails with intent (clockwise vs counterclockwise) and take a moment before the first sip to really appreciate the various aromas and set my intention for the evening (relaxation, creative pursuits, introspection, whatever). I'd also like to learn more about the witchy associations of the herbs & spices commonly used in different alcohols (ex. juniper, wormwood, angelica root, anise, elderflower, bitter orange...), as well as their historic uses/chemical compounds. So if anyone can share some trusted resources like that--even if they're not focused on alcohol--I would really appreciate it! 

Just in case anyone is curious, our go-to evening tipple is usually a cynar negroni, last word, corpse reviver, or manhattan. But my husband and I love to experiment with new drinks and unusual ingredients, including making our own amaro (unsuccessfully so far) and bitters, and dehydrating fruit for garnishes.",13,1735513374.0,SASSWitches,2,1.0,False

1hp8ft1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1hp8ft1/hard_to_engage_in_conversation_at_coffee_hour/,Hard to engage in conversation at coffee hour.,I’ve been attending an Orthodox church for 6 months now and not yet a catechumen. I’ve had a protestant upbringing and fell away from my faith in my 20’s and had a hard time with many passions in that time. I’ve asked my “creator” to rid me of many of them not really knowing what or who I was praying to. I asked him to take over and guide me. I was tired of feeling lost. He has led me to the Orthodox faith and made me realize He was Jesus the whole time and I had by my own will turned away from him. I’m coming to terms with the fact that the time I spent away from him is something I cannot take back. I must be entirely focused on him and I am in prayer daily reading the Gospel and scripture. During the liturgy my mind is entirely on God. Afterward at coffee hour I can’t shake the feeling that everyone is wary of me and doesn’t want anything to do with me. It’s not a large parish maybe 150 people or so. There is 1 or 2 people I feel comfortable talking to but even with them I feel it’s not always mutual. I have no other friends or family that are orthodox and my wife and I are there with our three kids. Is this all in my head or is this normal? I will continue to pray about it but any advice would be greatly appreciated!,4,1735513268.0,OrthodoxChristianity,11,0.84,False

However, this Christmas I received a bottomless portafilter with an unpressurized basket, and it immediately became clear that this grinder isn't sufficient - with an 18g dose on the finest setting, it's pulling upwards of 60g of espresso in only 10 seconds. As far as I'm aware, double the dose in 30 seconds (i.e. 18g ground coffee -> 36g espresso in \~30 sec) is a decent guideline, so my shots seem to be much too fast.

My dad is interested in buying me a better grinder for my upcoming birthday, and I've found a few options that seem to offer a decent balance of price vs quality:  
\- Baratza Encore ESP  
\- Fellow Opus  
\- Turin DF54 (seen particularly stellar reviews about this one, so it's my top pick at the moment)

If anyone has opinions about these grinders, or other high-quality grinders at a similar price, I'd love some help figuring out which grinder to get.

Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/uj3c4wr10m)

Strange things have been going on in this town. Disappearances left and right, with sometimes not even a single thing ever being found of that person ever again. Some folks say it’s the Pukwudgies. Magical little men in the woods that lure people to their demise. I’ve never believed in such things until somewhat recently, when I had an encounter with a spire of floating leaves. They called out to me for help but at the time I was too scared. My mother suggested it was a spirit or spirits. She’s always believed in paranormal stuff like that so she’s had my back through these strange times. That is until they took her.

I had come home from school one day and the police were at my house questioning my dad. In my room I found a note. On it my mother sounded borderline crazy, but she maintained her sweetness that she shared with everyone. She had gone on to say that, like the leaves I had seen, she witnessed a spire of sand that somehow was calling out to her. I don’t know why it’s sand this time, but I can assure you that I don’t think it’s the same kind spirit that was calling for help. My mother had gotten too curious and intrigued by my events that she wanted one for herself so badly that now she’s in danger.

I have to find my mom before they do.

It’s been a few days since the disappearance of my mom. I’ve gone into the woods alone after school on several occasions, just hoping that the leaves would show up again and bring me to her. They never did. At least, not yet they have. When I had told my mom about the strange occurrences I had been going through, I felt a little less alone. She always made me feel that way and hopefully she can again once I save her from whatever, or whoever, is out there.

I’m writing this from my last block of the school day. I don’t have game club tonight so I plan on going straight for the woods once I get off the bus. My dad has been so caught up in managing everything on his own now that he hardly notices that I’m out looking for mom sometimes. Every day though, I’ve noticed him get more and more irritable. Hopefully nothing comes of that.

Something came of that. In my room now, and just had a screaming match with my dad. He saw me grab a few things and put it in a backpack before trying to head out the door.

“Where do you think you’re going?” He snapped angrily. But I could tell that behind that anger, he was just concerned. Concerned I’d end up like mom.

“Um… I’m going out to look for mom.”

“That’s up to the police now son. There’s nothing we can do but pray she comes home safe.”

“But dad, they think she’s crazy.”

There was a moment of silence before my dad sighed and said something that made my blood boil.

“Maybe she is crazy…”

I snapped immediately. “HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT MOM!?”

“Did you even read what she said?! Sand beckoning for her? You seeing talking leaves?! Something’s wrong with her! She’s sick and the police are doing everything they can to bring her home!”

“But if I just get the leave’s attention maybe they’ll bring me to-” my defense and plan of action was quickly cut short.

“LISTEN TO YOURSELF! YOU’RE TURNING CRAZY JUST LIKE SHE DID!”

At this point my eyes were pouring. I just couldn’t believe he’d say such things about the woman who took such good care of both of us. I stormed off and slammed my door, just cutting off my dad’s final words.

“I CAN’T LOSE YOU TOO!”

You’re not going to dad. You’re not gonna lose anyone. I’m bringing mom home. Tonight. And I’ll update this as soon as I get back.

Please. Pray for my mom. Pray for her safety and salvation. Pray that I don’t run into the evils that lurk in those woods. Pray.

Six months later I write this now. I sit in my new room, in a new house, in a new town, in a new state, and in a new life. This is the story of how I came face to face with the Pukwudgies, and how I found my mom.

I snuck out my window once I knew my dad was fast asleep. If one thing ever remains constant in my life, it’s that my dad's snores could topple a building. I don’t know how my mother managed to ever sleep. But tonight, as of every night since mom was pronounced missing, before the thunder came the rain. I lay in bed in silence just listening to my father cry until he exhausted himself. I knew that if anything happened to me now, that he would be completely destroyed. I had time to think while I waited for him to sleep. Dad, I vow to come home safe above anything else. I closed the window behind me and started for the tree line.

I had the backpack I had packed earlier with rope, a flashlight, some batteries, a snack, a lighter, and an extra jacket. I also had a portable phone charger in case my phone died. I had no idea how to even use a rope the way Boy Scouts do. They make rope seem like the pinnacle of human creation but I can really just tie a simple knot. I’m not a survival expert, but because of social studies projects I know that rope is something important so I packed it anyway.

I held the flashlight I brought in front of me as I stumbled through the forest. The whole time I was just talking to myself hoping that the leaves would hear me and come to aid me. I got tired at one point so I sat against a tree and started looking through my camera roll. I scrolled through pictures of my little family. We all looked so happy. It’s crazy how one night can change everything. I stopped scrolling when I saw a picture of my parents' wedding. It was my dad and mom’s slow dance and they just looked so in love.

My dad gave my mom the most beautiful wedding ring. It was gold with different shades of blue diamonds and right in the middle, an emerald. Emeralds were my mom’s favorite. My dad’s was emeralds with a diamond between them since diamonds were my dad’s favorite. They both looked so happy, triggering me to speak aloud to myself again.

“I promise I’ll find her dad. I promise. And I’ll come home to you no matter what.” Shortly, I would fulfill that promise.

When I had decided to get up to keep going, I was hit with a familiar warmth. I couldn’t see them yet but I knew they were here. I glanced around the darkness and shrubbery with my flashlight before the beam landed on the movement of a couple leaves. This spiral was smaller than the others I had usually encountered.

“It’s you right? I’m not just looking at some random ass leaves?” I remember saying. 

The response I got still rattles me to this day with a mixed bag of emotions. Terrified, saddened, disturbed yet grateful.

“Shaun,” spoke the leaves in a soothing, calm voice. 

This voice, I will never forget. The same voice that made me feel better when I was distraught. The same voice that was filled with joy on Christmas mornings as I opened my gifts. The same voice my father heard say “I do”… my mother’s.

Her voice spoke louder than the rest amongst her. They were almost like a faint echo of men and women, some old, some young, but my mom’s lead them.

I was still in slight shock at hearing my mom. I thought I had found her for a moment, or that she had found me. Maybe I was hearing things. Maybe it wasn’t my mom. If it is though, why is she amongst the leaves?

“Go… home… Shaun.” My mother’s voice sounded slow as if it was difficult to talk. 

I responded after shaking off my original shock. 

“What? No, I need to find my mom.”

The leaves repeated themselves.

“Go… home… Shaun.”

I started getting slightly frustrated. My dad, the police, now even the leaves that brought me to here in the first place wanted me to drop what I was doing but I couldn’t. I needed to find mom.

“No! Either help me or get out of my way… please.” My mother always taught me to have manners.

I started walking past the leaves to pick back up my search. A cold breeze brushed the back of my hair and neck. It made me stiff up and shiver, but quickly became a warm and comforting feeling as if someone was running their hands soothingly through my hair.

“Please… I… love… you…”

My eyes started to water as I realized this was in fact my mother’s voice telling me to go home and leave her. I quickly turned around.

“M-Mom?” I said, my voice stumbling with a mix of sadness and joy. I was worried I would never hear her voice again.

The leaves were gone and the natural, cold air slowly started to return. I took a moment to gather myself and continued onward, ignoring the voice of the very person I was looking for, begging for me to turn around. But I couldn’t… I needed my mom back.

Eventually there was a recognizable clearing, but this time it reeked. I just stood at the edge of the clearing, pinching my nostrils shut. I scanned the clearing with my flashlight and that’s when I could see something moving inside one of the hallow, half cut trees. It was a clump of grey hair or fur, slightly moving while curled into a ball. I then noticed that it wasn’t just that stump, but all of them had a creature in them. I processed it too slowly, but I eventually came to and quickly turned off my flashlight and put it away. This time the little homes I had found there had occupants. I gasped and darted behind a tree thick enough to conceal me, crunching a few twigs in the process.

Herugh?

An animalistic, somewhat high pitched noise of confusion came from a few of the hollowed stumps and huts. It was a noise similar to the ones I heard here before, but this time they were home and I was the one coming into town.

Waiting in silence and fear, I listened closely for what action would take place as a response to the noise. It just stayed silent. In the silence I then realized that I could hear faint snoring of whatever things were tossing and turning in those homes. I thought the one I woke must’ve fallen back asleep so I peered out from behind the tree. Before me laid the same pit of bones from before.

The stench was coming from there, in the pit. It was more shallow than before, like they had filled it up. I had thought before that it could have been a pit for meal scraps that a hunter left on his sight. Knowing what I do now, it was in fact a scrap pit. It just wasn’t from some hunter. It was from them.

I glanced over the pit looking at the new bones that sat half buried in dirt before looking away. But something shiny had caught my eye. It was a ring.

This ring I could tell had some gold on it, but it wasn’t the gold that was shining so bright. The gems were refracting the moonlight which is what drew my attention. I almost didn’t even realize before looking back, that the ring was still on a finger.

I looked back up at the camp and darted my eyes around to make sure I wasn’t being watched. I drew my attention back to the pit and got down on my stomach. I reached into the pit with my right arm while my left still pinched my nose. I used my pointer, middle and thumb to pick up the finger by the ring. As I lifted it out of the loose dirt, I saw more fingers emerging from the ground. Dirt and gravel rolled off it like a small landslide that eventually revealed this was not just a ring, and not just a finger. It was a whole hand. Judging by the nails I could tell it was likely a woman’s disembodied hand.

Still pinching my nose and the ring, I started to stand up. I held the hand closer to my face to get a better look. I froze. It was my mother’s ring. I was holding my mothers hand.

I looked back down into the pit, shaking and in shock. The dirt had parted slightly when I picked up the hand, revealing half a skull with an eyeball still in it, “looking” towards me. It matched my eyes. It matched my mother’s eyes.

Sobbing echoed through the forest as I fell to my knees, cradling my mom’s amputated hand. I was having an extremely hard time catching my breath. Even now recalling the events, I start to fall back into that moment of pure and utter despair at the realization of my mother’s death.

There was only one thing that could take me out of how I was feeling, and it was waking up. Small, hairy little men about 4 feet tall started crawling out of their dens. Their eyes lit up in the light of the night sky. Their hair was long and hung all over them like the branches of a willow tree. Their shins and forearms were peeking through the court and made by the hair. Feet and hands, proportionally bigger than they should be, started crawling and walking towards me. Dozens of small, white pairs of dots watched me from the darkness with the only thing between us being the pit.

“WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER!?” I screamed with tears pouring down my face.

They began to rant and get excited as they ran for their racks and grabbed spears along smaller pointed sticks that I recognized. They started dipping their sticks in pots before approaching me. I took the time to take off and run.

Still cradling my finding, I ran through the trees in almost absolute darkness with only a few beacons of light shining through the thickly settled trees. I could hear the stampede of monsters sprinting after me. My fleeing was interrupted when I tripped and fell on what I thought was a root. It wasn’t.

I still clung onto my mom’s hand as I started to quickly get up. Looking down briefly at what I had tripped on. There in the grass, dimly lit by the moon, was my dad’s rifle. I looked up from it and saw shadows bouncing off the trees, sprinting through grass, and swinging from branches towards me. I felt like a wild animal being hunted down by neanderthals. 

I held my mom’s hand with my left and picked up the gun with my right before starting my sprint again. The gurgling laughter and screams of joy got louder and louder as I ran whilst trying to load a rifle single handedly. Me and my dad used to go on hunting trips where he’d teach me how to use a gun. Though, I was too much like my mom to shoot the animals we would find. In me, she’ll live on. But that could only happen if I could get out of there.

I didn’t even know where I was going. For all I know I could have been running even deeper into the woods. That’s when I heard rustling besides my own to my right. The dark silhouette I saw looked to me like the leaves so I instinctively followed.

I kept following the leaves but unlike every other time, they didn’t wait for me to catch up. I thought it was just due to urgency, but I thought wrong. I realized this when I had seen a break in the trees where moonlight was more prominent on the other side. Thinking it was my way out I used every bit of energy I had left to run for it.

I stumbled out of the trees and fell to my knees in the grass. I was back where I started. In the same clearing where my mother was buried. This time the pit was on the opposite side. And in the middle of the clearing all huddled together, was the Pukwudgies. They were waiting for me.

One of them emerged from a small cave in the ground right near me. He was slightly bigger and had longer hair than the others. A gust of sand in the shape of leaves emerged from the forest beside me and swirled around him. I soullessly stared off in realization at what had happened.

I had started to accept my fate as I clutched my mom’s hand in fear.

“I’m sorry mom. I- I should’ve gone home. I broke my promise to dad. He’s going to be all alone…”

I just sobbed. As the monsters that took my mom from me approached, I heard them stop and start murmuring about something. Then I felt a familiar warmth and my mind filled with hope and resilience. I raised my head. Above the pit on the other end of the clearing, were the leaves. They were in a spiral bigger than ever. They didn’t just catch my attention. All of the little men had turned to face them as well, including what I can only assume was their leader with the sand.

I took the little moment I had to cock the gun and aimed it right at the leader. Midway through turning back towards me, I shot him in the head. A boom echoed through the whole forest turning all the Pukwudgies' attention to me, and then to their leader. They all started screaming and crying as they threw their spears and sticks at me, a few sticking into my legs and shoulder.

Ignoring the shooting pain that started coursing through my body, I once again began to run with only some of them giving pursuit. I dropped my dad’s gun and my backpack to lose weight. It was now just me and my mom’s hand.

This time on my left, the same side I carried my mother’s hand, I saw the leaves at my side. They were close enough this time that I could tell it was them. Together we ran until the Pukwudgies followed no more. Finally we were out of the forest but I had no idea where I was. There was just a long road starching in both directions. Having no clue I started to lose hope again and so did my body.

Last thing I remembered I curled up on the side of the road while the leaves covered me to keep me warm. I shivered from the cold but also something else. Something was happening to my body. I only, now writing this, know that the Pukwudgies had dipped their sticks into a concoction they had made to debilitate their prey.

That was it. I wish there was more to my perspective back then but I got nothing. Whatever the Pukwudgies had hit me with took away two months of my life. I woke up in a hospital in a different town, in a different state, with a different house, and was expected to live a different life. The rest, I only know from my dad’s point of view.

My dad woke up in the morning and layed in bed staring at the ceiling. He sat there for almost two hours just thinking about his wife and wondering if she was ok. That amongst millions of things raced through his head such as how this would all impact me. Eventually he got up, made his coffee, and headed towards my room to wake me up. But when he opened my door, I wasn’t there.

A whole day later, police in my town got a call about a kid found unconscious on the side of a long desolate road holding a disembodied hand. The kid wouldn’t wake up but he had a low pulse. This child stirred up quite the commotion in the town because it could have been any of the missing children that had been lost since varying amounts of time. Eventually the hospital was able to identify me and called my dad.

I can’t begin to imagine what that one day felt like to my dad. No wife, no son. All in the blink of an eye he lost everything. If it weren’t for mom herself, he probably would’ve lived that day over and over for the rest of his life. A day, that by itself, probably felt like a lifetime.

The police were also able to identify the hand I had been holding as my mom’s due to the ring and fingerprints. My dad refuses still to tell me what else they had found out so I hit up Patrick. He was ecstatic to hear from me but was sad I had moved away without saying goodbye.

Patrick told me that forensics were able to tell that my mom’s hand had been gnarled off by human-like teeth while she was still alive, yet most likely paralyzed. The last of the blood in her hand had the same poison that had given me a coma. The hospital told my dad that if I had been given even a gram more of it, then I’d be paralyzed for life.

The police had finally found the stuff I had posted and thought that my brain was making up stuff in relation to actual trauma I had gone through. They think that a cannibalistic woodsman had been stalking me and tried to poison me the same way that he must have poisoned everyone he had kidnapped. A bounty was set up, but for whom? There was no man… only the Pukwudgies. They even found the clearing and choked it up as his camp.

Slowly I’ve noticed more people reading what I had posted and the legends of the Pukwudgies grew in and out of our town. People began hunting for them, trying to find them and prove they’re real. Best piece of evidence they have is my word, and the unknown animal hair and blood left at the abandoned camp. People have even found human-like footprints at the camp that many believe to be the Pukwudgies.

Sitting down writing this now, I wear my mom’s wedding ring on a chain around my neck. Even when she was dead, she still looked out for me till I was safe. Well, safe enough lol. She did leave me on the side of the road after all. All jokes aside, I really miss her. Yet part of me is at ease. Knowing she’s out there as one of the things she believed in so strongly brings back that warm feeling similar to the one the leaves brought me. Best way I can put it is extreme serenity.

Weeks go by and from the sound of it, missing persons have dropped in our town. Although there is one that I can’t feel too bad about.

Me and Patrick have been still talking consistently after both of us get out of our schools. Last night he told me about how Franklin read my logs and decided to go out with his jackass friends to jokingly hunt the Pukwudgies. Apparently they ran into them and Franklin has been missing since.

(Update from Patrick) Franklin was found hidden inside a hollow fallen tree and had soiled himself. Now he won’t stop talking about what he saw but no one believes him and honestly just makes fun of him. Karma has done its work beautifully.

With our town, now a legend, I end my logs here. I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe a new life isn’t so bad. I start high school soon and I can’t wait! I still go back to that town to meet with Patrick but I’m in Massachusetts now so it’s not too often. I’m happy, even though my mom isn’t here to be happy with me, but that’s what she would have wanted. Everytime leaves blow around in the street or cross my window on stormy nights, I know she’s there watching over me just like she did that night.",1,1735512973.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

I got a Pop+ a few days ago, followed setup instructions and it worked fine for our first few drinks. Once I went to use the larger pod that it came with though, it only put out a little bit of coffee instead of the full 7.7 oz. At first I thought it had just scanned the pod incorrectly or something? Then I opened the catch tray and there was quite a bit of coffee inside the machine. Did we just happen to get a bad machine? It also blinked red when I tried to run the cleaning process after.

I've really enjoyed using it and learning the past two years, and am able to make some really great to me tasting coffee. 

I'm going to send the machine in to home roasting supplies using their repair service, but now I'm also wondering if it's time to level up or try something new as well. 

If I did, I'd ideally like a slightly larger batch sizes, while still being used for personal consumption. My family drinks about 1- 2 lbs a week. I don't mind learning a new method either. Open to various price points. 

What would some of you more experienced roasters consider to be a logical upgrade path from the SR800? ",3,1735512929.0,roasting,17,1.0,False

First of all, thanks for checking out my post.  
Now it's time for the part where I try to convince you to send me a message and start a conversation.

⚡SEAN FACTS⚡️

1 - My name is Sean.

B - I’m 40 years old 🎉

3 - I’m Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world.

4 - I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

E - It’s not unusual to find me lost in a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them. In turn, if you are looking for a suggestion, i'm here to help.

F - I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

7 - I like to go to the gym. I've seen a few people post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I’m never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

If you think you’d like to chat with me and see how things go, don’t be scared to send me a dm!

I prefer to chat over on Telegram but we can hang here if we need to 😊

\*\*Please don't just message me saying ""hi"" or ""hey."" Please introduce yourself!\*\*
