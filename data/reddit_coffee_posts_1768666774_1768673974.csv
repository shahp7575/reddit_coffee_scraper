I’m in Tampa, working part-time (retail/gig stuff), but hours got cut last week due to slow season after holidays, so my next check isn’t until Friday and it’s only gonna be partial.

I have about $8 left in my account after paying what I could toward rent and electric (TECO bill is brutal this month with the AC running non-stop in this heat). My gas tank is on fumes—I need to get to my shift tomorrow and a job interview Tuesday, or I’ll lose both. Plus, fridge is basically empty except some ramen and condiments; I haven’t eaten a real meal since yesterday.

$30 would cover enough gas to make it through the week (\\\~$20) and grab basics like bread, eggs, peanut butter, milk from Walmart or a dollar store (\\\~$10). It’s not much, but it’d keep me from walking miles in the ""cold"" or missing work.

I’m happy to pay it back double and throw in a coffee or whatever to show I’m legit. I’ve been trying to stretch everything, applied for more hours, but it’s just one of those rough spots. 

If anyone can help even a few bucks via PayPal/CashApp, it’d mean a lot and get me through til payday. I’ll pay it forward when things stabilize.

1qfkjf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qfkjf2/i_18m_love_my_partner_18f_love_my_partner_but_our/,I (18M) love my partner (18F) love my partner but our relationship is not advancing. How can we evolve and get past our problems like adults?,"Instead of an TLDR you just read the first sentence of each paragraph.

I just need this to work. I have known her since we were 12 years old and I think its the first girl that i truly love. It is also my first serious relationship.

Before I start telling all my problems I have to make one thing clear: Dumping her is not an option. I will try my best to work around our problems and I hope I am mature enough to realise when i truly need to end things.

Please consider as well that things are not dramatic as it seems. I am only telling you the 'bad' side of our relationship

1) Communication is falling off. We are both studying some extremly difficult courses and finals are coming up, so it is understandable that we have limited time. But the problem is that when I call her either two of the following things happen: Either she is on a discord call with her friends and playing LOL, which by itself is a reason to break up (joking of course) or we have a really fun conversation for the first 15 minutes and then dries off into complete silence. I have no idea how to deal with that. The first part really annoys me.

2) Completly different lifestyles. Although that would normaly be a dealbreaker for me, I decided to stay with her because we have the same goals in our later lifes. However, the problem is how we spend our time together right now. What i looooved since I was little, was travelling. I loved going on to mini (or big) adventures with my friends or family and I would love if my girlfriend joined me. The problem is that her family is in financial hardship and cannot afford international trips or stuff like that for now. That is why I dont demand for her to come to me to visit (although she did visit one time with her own money, which I found sweet). But when I am just chilling at her home on uni break we dont do NOTHING. We dont go to grab a coffee or anything. We dont go out to eat. We dont even sit on the balcony and smoke a cigarette while we watch the street. She just lays in bed and wants to binge watch movies, which I enjoy but has gotten boring.

3) Different views on humanity, politics, etc. That is not much of a problem. I always respect what she says, even when I personally believe, that she muttered the most idiotic thing in existance. The thing is that I am more of like a guy of 'nothing ever happens' or 'all potliticians are the same', while she worries and cares a shit ton more about the world and the situation of it. I find that stupid to be honest. Worrying about stuff that you cant control is just taking years off your life, so why bother? Everybody has his own problems and they dont need to add more on top of them, the geopolitical situation of the world right now. Worrying or not will not change the outcome of the war in Ukraine, or the genocide in Gaza, or Trumps policies, or China buying off Africa.

4) Mood swings. Her mood changes faster than a politicians views, once he gets elected. It is absolutely crazy!!! I could speak with her for something nice and you know, have fun, but in the next moment she could be mad at me and I have to guess why, because she wont tell me. I dont even know what else to say at that point. Bonus point: She has admitted that she is aware of that problem and tries to fix it.

5) Septum piercing. I know, I know her body her choice and I completely agree. However, she recenently had a septum piercing that, I find horrendously ugly. I have expressed that I am not necessarily fond of it and she took too personal. Now every time we facetime, she hides it by turning in a way that is covered by her nostrils. I dont demand her to take it out, quite the opposite in fact, i want her to be herself around me, even if that means with a piercing that I dont like.

6) Loves me but does not find me attractive. I completly believe that she loves me with all her heart, even though she does not show it sometimes, but does not find me attracitve. Its not like I am completly chopped or something like that and she did find me attractive at the start of the relationship. Also I always try to behave like a gentleman. I once asked her about it and she admitted that she feels attracted to me only if I am physically there.

7) She never confronts me. I have tried to be as welcoming as possible to her. I have told her multiple times that healthy and measured critisim in a relationship is VERY important and I try to tell her my problems. The thing is that when I say that she should for example 'at least see the reels I send her late at night and dont skip over them' she gets sad for a minute and bends her head down. She values my opinion a lot and I dont know if I should even talk back to her or critise her, because her reactions are not normal. For example she gets distanced and extremly sad for a sec and then ignores everything that happened. I think that has something to do with the mood swings.

Half of those issues I said here could be solved if had a mature and respectful conversation. I already feel like I am married or something and I know that most likely I am not correct on all our issues.

How can I find a solution to each and every one of them like an adult and not like an idiot?

1qfki7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1qfki7g/former_hr_here_subtle_signs_your_company_is/,Former HR here - subtle signs your company is preparing for layoffs,"I’ve been through 3 rounds of layoffs (twice in HR, once when I was also laid off), and there’s a pattern that emerges before the axe falls. Not trying to create paranoia, but if you’re seeing multiple signs on this list, it might be time to update your resume.

This got long, so I’ve broken it down by timeline and severity. Hopefully this helps someone see what’s coming and prepare accordingly.

EARLY WARNING SIGNS (3-6 months out)

Financial and strategic shifts:

Hiring freeze gets announced, especially if it’s sudden or poorly explained. When companies say “we’re being strategic about growth” out of nowhere, that’s HR-speak for “we’re about to cut costs aggressively.” Pay attention to whether it’s a soft freeze (critical roles only) or hard freeze (literally nobody).

Executives start talking about “efficiency,” “operational excellence,” “doing more with less,” or “rightsizing” in all-hands meetings. Once leadership starts using these phrases repeatedly, start paying attention. They’re preparing employees psychologically for cuts.

The company misses earnings or revenue targets multiple quarters in a row, or leadership keeps revising guidance downward. Public companies especially - check their investor relations page and quarterly calls.

Consultants show up. Specifically McKcKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or similar firms. They’re not there to make things better for employees - they’re there to identify “redundancies” and provide cover for cuts leadership already wants to make. If you see consultants doing org chart analysis or “efficiency studies,” that’s a massive red flag.

Leadership changes at the top. New CEO, CFO, or COO often means new priorities. New executives frequently want to “make their mark” within the first 100 days, and layoffs are a quick way to cut costs and restructure.

Budget and resource signals:

Training and development budgets disappear. Conference approvals get denied, software licenses don’t get renewed, that certification you wanted gets tabled indefinitely. When companies stop investing in employee development, they’re not planning long-term with current staff.

Discretionary spending freezes. Team outings canceled, holiday parties scaled back or eliminated, small perks disappear. These are the easiest costs to cut first.

Delayed or frozen merit increases and bonuses. If annual raises get “postponed” or bonuses are cut despite decent performance, the company is hoarding cash for something.

Open headcount gets quietly closed. You might not notice a hiring freeze officially, but those three open roles on your team just stop being discussed.

Cultural and messaging changes:

The “we’re a family” messaging intensifies. Ironically, when companies start really pushing the culture stuff hard, it’s often because morale is tanking and they know what’s coming. Authentic culture doesn’t need constant reinforcement.

Town halls become more frequent but less substantive. Leadership is trying to control the narrative and keep people calm, but they’re not actually saying anything meaningful.

Internal communications shift tone. Messages become more formal, more carefully worded, more legal-sounding. This usually means lawyers are reviewing everything.

Real estate and facilities:

Office consolidation starts being discussed. Subleasing space, breaking leases early, or suddenly pushing hybrid/remote work after being office-focused. Real estate is expensive and often the first place companies look to cut.

Facilities staff reductions. If maintenance, security, or reception teams shrink, that’s a leading indicator.

MEDIUM-TERM SIGNS (1-3 months out)

The ones people miss:

Your manager starts acting weird in 1-on-1s. They seem distant, can’t give you clear answers about future projects, or suddenly don’t want to talk about your career development, or they cancel 1-on1s. They often know 4-6 weeks before you do and are terrible at hiding it. Watch for:

\- Avoiding eye contact

\- Being vague about Q2/Q3 planning

\- Not fighting for resources they normally would

\- Seeming stressed or checked out

Cross-functional projects get canceled or put on hold indefinitely. If that big initiative involving multiple teams suddenly loses steam, it’s often because leadership knows the teams won’t exist soon.

Reorganizations that don’t make sense. When they shuffle reporting structures or combine teams in weird ways, they’re often preparing for consolidation. The reorg is the setup; the layoff is the follow-through.

Senior people start leaving and aren’t replaced. When your VP quietly exits and the role just disappears or gets absorbed, that’s a restructure preview. Execs often see the writing on the wall before layoffs and jump ship.

The “high performer” narrative shifts. Suddenly everyone’s being evaluated more critically, PIPs increase, and the bar for “meeting expectations” gets higher. They’re building paper trails.

HR and administrative signals:

HR schedules random meetings with employees to “check in.” This can be them gauging morale, but it can also be them identifying who might be problems during layoffs (ie, who might sue or cause issues).

Increased focus on documentation. HR suddenly cares a lot about having everything in writing, attendance records are scrutinized, minor policy violations are documented. They’re building files.

Anonymous surveys about “organizational effectiveness” or “role clarity.” They’re identifying redundancies and overlapping responsibilities.

Operational changes:

Vendors get cut or renegotiated aggressively. If the company is trying to save money everywhere, labor costs are next.

Projects shift from innovation to maintenance. All the exciting new work stops, and teams are just keeping lights on. This suggests they don’t believe in long-term investment right now.

Contractors and temps disappear first. This is always the canary in the coal mine. If contractors are let go en masse, full-time employees are usually 4-8 weeks behind.

Financial desperation moves:

The company takes on debt or seeks additional funding under unfavorable terms. This suggests cash flow problems.

Asset sales. Selling off business units, real estate, IP, or other assets to raise cash.

Delayed payments to vendors. If your company is stretching payables or late on bills, they’re struggling with cash.

IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS (2-4 weeks out)

The “oh shit” tier:

You or your team suddenly gets asked to document all your processes in detail, create runbooks, or do knowledge transfers “for continuity.” They’re preparing for people to be gone and don’t want institutional knowledge walking out the door.

Managers have mysterious meetings that aren’t on the calendar, or meetings that say “leadership sync” with no agenda. Often they’re being told how to “rank” their teams (stack ranking) or getting trained on how to deliver termination news.

HR blocks calendar time that’s marked private across the entire organization on the same day. That’s layoff day. Usually a Wednesday or Thursday.

Managers seem panicked or are suddenly unavailable. They’re either in planning meetings or mentally preparing for what they have to do.

IT or Security starts asking random questions about access, or you notice permissions audits. They’re preparing to revoke access quickly.

Conference rooms get blocked all day with “private” meetings. Those are the termination meetings.

The parking lot has way more cars than usual early in the morning on a random day. Leadership arrives early to prepare and coordinate.

The final 48 hours:

Executives all happen to be “in the office” on the same day when they’re usually remote or traveling. They want to show their faces and deliver messages in person.

Your manager asks for a “quick sync” with no context, or you get a calendar invite for early morning with just “meeting.” That’s often the termination conversation.

You notice coworkers disappearing into conference rooms and not coming back, or leaving with boxes. If it’s happening, it’s happening to multiple people today.

Email access starts acting weird, VPN connections drop, or badge access to certain areas stops working. IT is already starting to shut you down.

WHAT TO DO - ACTION PLAN

Preparation phase (as soon as you see early signs)

Update LinkedIn immediately. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling. Turn on “open to work” privately so recruiters can see it but your company can’t.

Refresh your resume and tailor it for your target roles. Have multiple versions ready for different job types. Get it reviewed by someone who knows your industry.

Document your accomplishments with metrics. Revenue generated, costs saved, projects delivered, teams built. Save this somewhere personal, not company equipment.

Save important files legally. Performance reviews, reference letters, samples of your work (that aren’t confidential), documentation of your achievements. Email them to your personal account or save to personal cloud storage. Do NOT take confidential company information, client data, or proprietary code.

Screenshot or save your LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements. Sometimes people leave and delete their profiles.

Reconnect with your network NOW while you’re employed. It’s easier to get coffee as a “catch up” than as a desperate job seeker. Reach out to old colleagues, mentors, recruiters you’ve worked with.

Financial preparation:

Build emergency fund if possible. Even an extra month of expenses helps.

Understand your benefits. Know your PTO balance, how severance works at your company (if there’s a standard package), what COBRA costs, when your stock vests, and what happens to your 401k.

Reduce expenses where you can. Not to panic level, but maybe hold off on big purchases.

Check if you have any loans against 401k or obligations tied to employment. Some companies require repayment upon termination.

Legal and administrative:

Keep records of everything. If you suspect you’re being targeted unfairly (discrimination, retaliation), document it meticulously with dates and witnesses.

Check your employment contract for non-compete, non-solicitation, and IP assignment clauses. Know what you signed.

Mental preparation:

This is not about your worth. Layoffs are business decisions, usually driven by executive mistakes or market conditions. Even top performers get cut.

Have a plan for how you’ll spend day one after a layoff. Whether it’s updating your resume, going for a run, or calling a friend, having a plan helps you not spiral.

Tell your partner or trusted person what might be coming. Don’t suffer alone or let it blindside your household.

If/when it happens:

Don’t sign anything immediately. You usually have time to review severance agreements. Consider having an employment lawyer review it, especially if it includes non-compete or release clauses.

Negotiate if possible. Severance, extended healthcare, references, job search support, equity vesting. The worst they can say is no, and many companies have wiggle room.

File for unemployment immediately. Even if you get severance, you might be eligible. Don’t leave money on the table.

Ask for a neutral reference or letter of recommendation before you leave. Much easier to get this on day one than six months later.

Understand what’s happening to your benefits. COBRA deadlines, life insurance conversion options, FSA/HSA balances.

Get contact info for colleagues you want to stay in touch with. Once you lose email access, it’s hard to reconnect.

Job search strategy:

Take a day or two to process emotionally. You don’t have to start applying immediately.

Quality over quantity. Targeted applications with customized materials beat spray-and-pray.

Use your network first. Most jobs are filled through referrals. Let people know you’re looking.

Consider contract or freelance work to bridge gaps. It keeps money coming in and shows you stayed active.

Be honest in interviews about the layoff. “Company went through restructuring” or “position was eliminated due to budget cuts” is fine. Most interviewers get it, especially if layoffs were public.

WHAT NOT TO DO

Don’t panic or make it obvious you’re job hunting. Don’t print your resume on the company printer, don’t take recruiting calls at your desk, don’t update LinkedIn with “OPEN TO WORK” publicly while still employed.

Don’t badmouth the company publicly. Even if you’re furious, keep it professional. The industry is smaller than you think.

Don’t stop doing your job. Keep performing until the end. You want good references and you never know what might change.

Don’t burn bridges with your manager. Even if they’re delivering bad news, they’re probably just doing what they were told. Stay professional.

Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Seriously, don’t steal company property, access data you shouldn’t, or do anything that could give them cause for termination instead of layoff. You want that severance and unemployment eligibility.

AFTERMATH - IF YOU SURVIVE THE CUT

Survivor’s guilt is real. It’s okay to feel relieved and also sad for colleagues who were let go.

Your workload is about to increase dramatically. Set boundaries early and document what’s not getting done. Don’t try to do three people’s jobs.

Start looking anyway. Companies that do one round of layoffs often do more. Plus, the culture and workload might not be sustainable.

Support your laid-off colleagues. Write recommendations, make introductions, be a reference. What goes around comes around.",1,1768673782.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False
1qfkhmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HausOfMausSnark/comments/1qfkhmb/how_many_maus_harm_stories_is_it_now/,How many Maus Harm stories is it now?,"From Catcoven on tiktok. I have permission to share

48 she,her,hers 
Cis yt AFAB
Queer socialist/leftist antizionist patrilineal liberal reform Jewish femme who is neurodivergent/ on autism spectrum
Deal with cptsd, grief trauma, perimenopause, anxiety and depression 

 After the overturning of Roe V. Wade in 2022- I was distraught and traumatized like many many other women, femmes and afab. I had been scrolling tiktok for a year by then and one day I saw  Maus’ live on my fyp. She was quirky, she was spunky, she was funny & she took no shit. I felt like I found someone who was “fighting the good fight” against pro forced birthers and misogynists. I bought her tshirts and wore them proudly. “Don’t hate me because you’re a doucehbag” and others. I remember when we got big 1k ppl lives and getting mass reported. It kept us dancing around tikok trying to hold space somewhere for bodily autonomy. I felt part of something bigger.

 I typically don’t do well with bigger groups of friends or groups of women but our extended group felt like a chosen family of sassy weirdos and I loved it.. Sometimes we would just joke and drink on live and be naughty- it was fun. In general, I don’t conform and I don’t “fit in” especially since I am neurodivergent.  I am outspoken, passionate, and yah sometimes I am loud (I spent a large part of my life as a theatre artist and I am from the east coast so it isn’t an insult to me! For those that think it is makes me laugh. That’s all ya got??? )
   In Maus’ sphere-I felt like I had purpose in a world that wasn’t recognizable for women anymore. I tried to “manage” things for Maus once she made me a moderator. Watching the comments like a hawk as soon as I woke up, ejecting the trolls, blocking the guests who used slurs etc. We had a group of 20 original mutuals who joined a discord specifically for Maus.This was the OG discord for Maus. Apparently she has had more since.
      Slowly, Maus started to lean on and trust me more and more for support, organization, coordinating lives etc etc. She came to me first to strategize many times before talking to the rest of the group about topics. She called me her “ride or die.” I felt special that she singled me out and said she needed me and our friendship. She had my phone number. She had my address. She knew my full government name. She knew my business website. She knew exactly what nonprofit I volunteer for and I am part of the board of directors. In retrospect, I wonder now sometimes if this was all her manipulation because I can’t trust that she ever truthfully cared for me sincerely at this point. She seemed safe then though- I wasn’t being hypervigilante with her like other femme friends in the past.
     All this to illustrate to you that I loved this woman. We would speak on the phone. I would be solely Maus focused & distraught when she was crying or mad. When she needed me I dropped things as quickly as I could to help her. I removed ppl from her discord for her. I would relay messages to those she cut out and blocked. 
      I am a generous person who deliberately works hard to make friendships substantive and not transactional. I wanted community and it was exhilarating sometimes! Our goal before the 2022 midterm elections was to do as much outreach on tiktok to try and change as many minds as possible. The day before the elections we held a “a group incantation” that I had found to use witchy vibes for our protection and advantage and we all repeated it on a discord call (cheesy I know but it was cool to have solidarity)
       Then, after the Blue wave 2022 she became different. We had done really well but she was withdrawn. It was confusing because we had really great results and we built these friendships too. I told her she didn’t have to come back to doing lives but that she seemed sad and I wanted to support her to feel confident again.  And she did slowly come back to lives on tiktok but she had a renewed vigor for a new topic for her. She began to become increasingly involved in lives of LGBTQIA+individuals and actively supported a popular transgender creator, frequently participating in panel discussions and immersing herself in the community. One particular trans creator we would laugh and kiki with regularly on live. 
     Many times, when Maus would debate for trans rights I remember getting frustrated because she didn’t always have thorough knowledge or evidenced arguments and sometimes (many times) I would try and correct her gently after the fact. Maus would have queer and trans representation on panel sometimes but not always and I felt responsible a lot of the time for making sure we didn't “go off the rails.”
     Then, one day she made a huge overture to get into vc - she had a really big issue she needed input on. She laid out what she had learned behind the scenes from a mutual about our trans friend. We heard her out. 
Something about a reddit thread. 
Something about a lesbian creator. 
Something about a call out a year previous. 
Something about lawsuit?  
A few of us were like”….. ok? What do you want us to do about this?” I wasn’t sure we needed to do anything especially since there was word of some type of legal action. I distinctly remember saying “hey we should see whatever this “evidence is,” and come back and talk about it in discord after.” She was activated and I feel like I did try and de-escalate her vibe at this point.. She had only intimated she wanted to “do something” but she wasn’t specific about what.  So I read the reddit as thoroughly as I could and we went in another group vc with her.
      I chirped in and said first, this is a trans creator and right now in our political climate we have to be really careful how we shine light on trans people.  
I thought to myself “It feels like she felt icky around some interactions but what is she asking us to do? I don’t see “real” receipts in any of this”
     Now mind you some others we knew had had uncomfortable experiences feeling sexualized by the trans creator but that is a conversation CALL IN with a mutual in private. I didn’t think it was necessarily our job to go “warn” people etc. Its generally best with someone you are mutuals or friends with to talk to them first if you can to see if the behavior can be modified. Or to ask directly about the accusations to gage if you personally want deal with this etc. If not those things- just remove them, blocking them or whatever and go about your business. 
      I clearly said to Maus that the “optics” of “calling out” the trans creator (in whatever way) wouldn’t look good on her or us as a group. Especially since in order for it to be legit we would need more than a mostly anonymous user reddit thread. Many comments were anonymous and there was no way we could verify their veracity. (In addition there was also blatant transohobia in the reddit. Not by every commenter but it was there)
      She insisted that she was really mad and that she deemed the trans creator “a predator.” I was like “woh ok” in my head and tried to de-escalate her further again. I suggested and then I THOUGHT we all agreed to sleep on it AND TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW. In my head I thought she would process it some more and come to a different conclusion the next day or that I could work on her some more to support her through feeling so triggered to find a more productive course of action. I thought I had time to mold whatever action she initiated. 
 So I went to sleep. I wake up the next morning and everyone in the discord has apparently been up and doing a live with Maus already. But then I notice- they’re commenting in the discord thread about how its a callout not a live debate and that it’s about the trans creator. I am shocked. I go into her live and all I say is hello in the comments and within 20 seconds the guest invite timer box is in front of me. She wants me on panel RIGHT NOW. I thought of decliniing it - but I didn’t know what kind of reaction she would have to that and I never wanted to upset her. We were always on eggshells for her. I hadn’t even had coffee and it was still very early in my timezone. I accepted the invite. The invite I SHOULD have declined. And that’s when myself, and many other mutuals cycled through and performed our BLIND LOYALTY test. I said things I shouldn’t have uttered and will not utter here. Some of it was clipped and put on youtube and I tried to tread the line between my loyalty to her and trying to make sure my reputation didn’t go down the tubes however the damage was done. My actions and words were harmful. 

That live was not something I wanted to do, planned to do nor felt was necessary. But in my head at the time, I thought that it would be safer for her if there were other people doing it with her. I thought I was protecting her by not defecting or abandoning her. I was also scared of her- she had all my info and atp I realized FUCK what if she gets mad at me.I knew what she was like when she was mad. Pushing back or challenging her would not go well.

But I was gobsmacked in that live that she took it even further-
Maus now accused him of sexual assault which we did not have “receipts” of nor direct testimony of. She also questioned the safety of his kids and I like a little mimicking parrot said it too. Gross. I should have stuck to leaving kids OUT of it. It was wrong to bring them up. I was in her cult and but had no idea until now that I had to break from her somehow. But the live was snowballing and I was in the thick of it doubling down. It was not ok and its still not ok. 
      Now, Some mutuals had reported feeling sexually harassed or sexualized by this person- thats not ok either. However, Harassment is not assault. Both can be sexual in nature but they are not synonmous. Maus proceeded to cry and crash out for awhile and it felt like she was making herself the victim which confused me. She was not harmed directly by the trans creator nor did she have alleged survivors of a sexual assualt coming to share their story. It’s my personal opinion she was triggered into her own ptsd and thats why the disproportionate reaction ( but I am not a psych professional so I can only theorize.)
     We finished the live and chaos ensued of course. Mutuals were taking sides. And Maus held 2 more lives discussing it again. One I agreed to to be friends only and the last public one she did on her own. After the last one- I told Maus directly YOU HAVE TO STOP DOING LIVES ABOUT THIS NOW. And I made sure to tell people in the discord that I didn’t help “plan” this and that that was all Maus (and whoever hyped her up in the moments leading up to that first live.)
   Thats when someone took a short clip of something I said one of the lives and put it on youtube. I was flabbergasted but in hearing the negative impact I made I realized that I did have accountability to take. So I tried to tread the line between loyalty to Maus with trying to rehab my reputation, apologize for the hurt of my words and give mutuals a chance to judge for themselves. I made a friends only response video and someone took it and put it on their youtube channel. I felt like I was swimming and drowning in chaos Maus had started. Maus didn’t say much about my video but I knew she was not satisfied I didn’t consult her about doing it first. At this time she stopped talking to me and thats when Missandry came back from a trip (wasn’t involved in the live callouts) inserted herself as some peacemaker moderator and decided to take that chance to try and push me out. She mispresented my words somehow and Maus demanded I meet in VC. Where she screamed at me about the point I kept making about being auto invited into panel that day. She NEVER INVITES people into panel she said. I was lying she said. I said this is what I experienced and I expressly remember the “maus has invited you as a guest” timer box. I might not have had coffee but I didn’t imagine that. So instead of her being accountable for going too far with the callout of the trans creator - she  deflected to accusing me of lying and being a narcissist. I can’t remember everything she said but she was screaming at me and I was screaming back. Thats when I was ejected from the discord. I told Missandry I was deleting my tiktok (in my head I know now so i could control who had access to me and also so if in the future I wanted to come back I would be redoing my whole fyp, my mutuals and being able to block her accounts) I had 2 friends from that time come to me and hold space with me, with them  for healing in a private 3 person discord since 2023. I am grateful they stuck with me. I was scared of her and honestly, I knew then and now that it was my relationship with her that caused all this and that I meant well but it didn’t matter. I did some bullshit. So when I came back to tiktok a month later I wouldn’t use the same name and I wouldn’t use my face. For a really long time. Maus is harmful. She is manipulative. She is a covert narcissist. It has taken a long time to heal and parse it out. She is a dangerous person especially for afab, women and all other marginalized communities. I hate hearing she rinse and repeated the cycle over again and continues to harm. But now we have solidarity among her survivors. You aren’t alone. I am not alone. And we can’t be gaslit or convinced anything she did to me or us was or is ok. Basta Maus. Enough.

1qfkfy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1qfkfy8/help_family_matter_need_opinions/,"Help! Family matter, need opinions","\*If there’s any Dcs workers in here maybe you can give me some guidance as well but I need some moms opinions here please… anyone’s opinions really\*

\*Will also update along the way!!!\*

I was just in a situation and I don’t know if I should call Dcs on this family or not, or who I could call to get them help they need… I’m not big on calling Dcs on people trust me, but the situation just isn’t sitting well with me. I’ve had the thought heavy with me and little things keep happening to where I feel like it’s signs from god to do something. And yes, this is family of mine that im speaking of. This is going to be a long post and I thank you for barring with me. So let me explain. 

I’m a recovering addict. I’ll be a year sober in April. So April of 2025 I went to rehab for 30 days and me and my fiancée got clean. I knew staying in my home state would be a bad idea for my sobriety. My fiancées sister (who I have never met or even talk to the whole 7 years me and him have been together) reaches out offering a place for us to stay and it’s out of state so we would be away from where we knew we could get dr\^gs. We could get back up on our feet. I was iffy about it but we agreed to do it. I left my older three children with their dad till we could get on our feet and get our own place in that state. Me and my fiancée took our two kids with us up there. 

Now I want to add that I was an addict for 3-4 years. So my kids im sure seen some stuff in their time. I did not raise them like I do now. You know I spent most of my time out trying to get Dr\^gs and was an absent mother a lot and they was always with someone else. So I know I’m not a perfect mother but I’m trying to be now. That’s why I’m worried about these other kids right now. But those facts had to be named so that you can understand some of what I’m about to say. 

\*we will call his sister Mary and his brother in law Bob in this\* 

Of course when we first got there the first couple days were okay. A lot of visiting and catching up to do with my 4 nieces and nephews that I was just now getting to meet for the first time and that my fiancée was getting to see after not seeing them for 7 years. Right away I got told that me being on suboxone was me using it as a clutch because I wasn’t strong enough to stay off drugs for my children. I was told this by their 12 year old daughter. She said she heard her parents say this. When I asked them about it they said They did not like that I was taking medication for my mental health. They said it was because my mind is too weak for reality. They don’t believe in medicine, they don’t believe in doctors and they don’t agree that I do that in their house around their children because they don’t do that. (I also learned a week or two later That I can’t even take my children to the doctor because my daughter had a uti \*4 year old\* and had a fever.. I had to call an Uber to take me to the hospital and they almost kicked me out.) 

I debated these things though because I needed this place to get on my feet. To be away from dr\^gs because I didn’t think I could do it back in my home state. I had tried to get sober so many times before and couldn’t there. So I offered to follow their rules with one acception. If my kids need to go to ER or DR they could. I cold turkey quit all my meds. (I was having hard time getting them out of state with no insurance now that I moved from my state I was in anyways so I was going to have to quit anyways). I was sick as a dog for about a month. 

I learned more about their beliefs that I had to follow and had to take away from my children and what I believe in. There was no such thing as a tooth fairy. I had to tell them that it was something parents made up to make it fun to loose teeth. There was no such thing as Santa Claus. He don’t bring presents at all. There was no such thing as Christmas anymore. Christmas was not allowed to be celebrated and they got no gifts anymore. No Christmas tree. No Halloween. No trick or treating. No holiday at all will be talked about or celebrated except 4 th of July (did I mention bob was in the army). Couldn’t even read books about those holidays. Birthdays are not special. You get to go grocery shopping for your birthday on that day in the week that is pay day day. And you get to choose one thing to buy or they’ll give you cash but neither could be over $20. 

Now this is just their beliefs to give you an idea, okay? I know these things aren’t “calling Dcs worthy”. Ages of the children are 22yo male, 12yo female, 10yo male, 6yo male. And because some of this isn’t going to maybe sound bad to some of you let me add that every single child has came to me (on their own with out me asking or even letting it be known that I’m not okay with their beliefs or that I didn’t like how they made me take that away from my children) and said they all hate their parents. They have all wanted to call the cops on them or run away or even unalive themselves to get away from the situation they are stuck in. That once they all get of age when they can legally leave on their own and they will never talk to them again. The older 22yo can’t leave really because he is stuck and I’ll tell you more on that in a minute. 

We stayed in the garage technically as our room with our children. We learned that they had a very strict schedule. I was okay with it though because I had never had structure in the past couple of years so I figured that’s what we needed to follow as well. Mind you my 6 & 4 yo were kinda “out of control”. (They just didn’t listen really and would still do things they were told they couldn’t do). They wasn’t parented because I had been on dr\^gs. All this was layed out to bob and Mary and they knew we were trying to correct them but I didn’t wanna be so harsh about it and I wanted to give them time. This is how they was raised so how is it their fault ya know? They both are adhd and really didn’t listen much. Let me add that I do believe in whooping my children but I do not believe in whooping with a belt or paddle, or smacking my kids in the face at all especially their MOUTH. I don’t believe in screaming at the top of my lungs or cursing my children. 

Each one of their kids had their own schedules  of chores. That’s all they would do all day long. Every single child cleaned, did outside chores, and organized all day long. They don’t believe in school so they didn’t send their kids to school. They were “home schooled”. (Never seen her teach them from June 2025- November 2025). I was told my kids wouldn’t be allowed to go to school either. I had to home school them. Apparently in that state you can call the school and just tell them your home schooling and don’t have to show any proof that you teach them? I dunno if that’s true but none of their children ever went to school so I’m guessing it’s true. Mary stayed home and did nothing but cook all day long. Bob worked with his older son or was in his “grow room/office” playing the computer games all day long. Never came out except for dinner. 

No tv, no electronics, only educational movies allowed. These children were sheltered bad. They have no idea what goes on in the real world because they are never allowed to leave the house. They didn’t get to go to the store or anything (unless it was their birthday week). No going to the park. No going to visit family. No nothing. They was allowed to go to church and that’s it. But they couldn’t speak about their home life there or anything. Completely diffrent family at church. They wasn’t allowed to have friends. The reason is because other people didn’t share their beliefs and they didn’t want anyone putting anything in their children’s minds. Again I understand this isn’t really Dcs worthy. I’m not there yet. 

Besides the beliefs thing we didn’t agree with. The second problem we had was that we ordered food from Walmart. And we had bought some junk food for our kiddos. Like some chips and snack cakes and stuff for snack time. They told us we wasn’t allowed to do that because they didn’t want their children seeing that stuff because they wasn’t allowed to eat it. Nothing sweet or junk food what so ever. No cereal or pop tarts. Everything had to be home made cooked and that was it. 

Third problem. Their kids would come into the garage (use to be their play room) and hang out with us all. I wouldn’t ever tell them anything I wouldn’t think is okay. But their parents were complaining to them about us and the things we do that they don’t believe in. And they would come down and wanna hear why we did those things. Like holidays and stuff like the tooth fairy. I just explained that it makes life fun for us and I do it because my family did it for me. They knew we use to do dr\^gs because their parents told them. So when questioned about it what am I supposed to say? So I wanted to tell them that if they ever get offered to do dr\^gs once they’re out on their own to not do it. I explained how those things made us loose everything we had. Our home our car we was living in a tent before I went to rehab and was on the verge of loosing our children to Dcs. I explained my teeth that are damaged was because of dr\^gs. Because their parents never explained any of that. And I wanted them to understand dr\^gs are the worst thing in the world. I didn’t want them to turn out like me never being told that and then when offered dr\^gs I tried them because I had no idea. Ya know? Well they didn’t like I told them that. 

So then it was a problem that they came down to visit us. So they were banned from coming down unless their parents said it was ok. (Rarely happened). We were furious about this. The children told us that they told them when they was on the way home from church (we were sick and didn’t wanna go and get the old ppl sick) and told them they didn’t even trust to leave us alone in their home and we wasn’t allowed to baby sit them anymore. Our children wasn’t allowed to play with their children with out adult supervision. My children wasn’t allowed out of the garage unless one of us adults was with them. So they didn’t have free range of the home anymore. At this point my children were so scared of bob and Mary. 

They had seen us all argue and bob scream at me and get in my face because I wouldn’t punish my children like they did their own. Let me explain. When Mary would cook something you either eat it or they would save it for their next meal. So their 6 yo was clearly autistic. No doubt about it. I have an autistic son so trust me I know. (Which they told me that it was because I let him have his first vaccine when he was born, and they never had their son vaccinated so he wasn’t autistic he was just diffrent). He hated peas, and he hated spaghetti, and some other stuff. After asking it was a texture thing. He would cry and not wanna eat those things. Bob and his anger issues would scream at him in his face telling him he would eat it or get his butt whooped with the belt. This always resulted in him sitting there from 6pm to 7pm and at 7 he was getting the belt and hitting him 5 times really hard. And then sending him back to the table to eat. They made him put the food in his mouth and swallow it like a pill with water. This poor baby. They didn’t care.

Well I can’t do that to my children. I just can’t. I feel that is so so wrong. So that lead to many of fights because we all had to eat together every single meal and their children seen my kids “get away with” not eating a couple of things. My daughter hated rice and anything potatoe wise. And my son didn’t like green beans or peas. I also wouldn’t allow the belt to be used on my child and I didn’t smack them in their mouth and they said I was ruining my children because of this. I fought back about it because I didn’t believe in it and I thought it was wrong. They brag about how Bob choke slammed his oldest son when they got into an argument. 

Bob talked his older son into signing a mortgage with him to be able to get a new bigger home a year prior to us coming. He promised the kids that things would be completely diffrent. And so he did it. He paid 1500 (half the mortgage a month), put $100 towards groceries every two weeks , paid half the lights and water bills. He was always left with maybe $200-$300 every pay check. (He wants out by the way). In which Bob would wind up borrowing $200 of it every week and never paid it back because he would always buy $500-$600 in weed every week and would also buy his wife Mary 2 big bottles of liquor. Bob wouldn’t allow his 22yo to drive or get a license. He had a car but never got to practice. They didn’t want him to because they knew once he did that he could leave on his own and they knew he would. 

Their 12yo daughter I noticed always had some smell of sweating and BO. I asked about it and she said her parents wouldn’t allow her to wear deodorant unless it was “clean”. So she made her own but it didn’t even help because her and her mother always smelled of BO. I found a clean brand of deodorant they agreed with and I bought it for her. She always asked to do my make up or my 4yo daughters make up which I allowed her to do. Once they seen that I allowed my daughter to play dress up and wear make up they lost their minds. Saying I was ruining her face. I then learned that she wasn’t allowed to wear make up, dress up, show her shoulders or chest at all, show her legs at all, she couldn’t even wear anything with a heel on it. She wasn’t allowed to shave her pits or legs which really took a toll on her confidence because her hair was black. She wanted to shave down there because she said when she bleeds she hates how clots get stuck in her hair. She wasn’t allowed to ask her parents about herself at all. So at one point she came to me asking about having feelings down there and she thought something was wrong with herself. They constantly told her the reason that she couldn’t do these things was because men would sexualize her (let me add that Bob is a registered sex offender. I didn’t know till about a month or two before we left. Didn’t know the story behind it but after looking him up he was 26 at the time and the girl was 15-16 yo. I had been told he was one when me and my fiancée first got together. I had just forgot over the 7 years we were together). They never was allowed new clothes ever. 

Anything that went wrong in that house was always our fault or our kids fault. A stake had been pulled out of the ground and Mary lost her mind over it. My kids hadn’t been outside so I went and asked their kids if they had touched this stake. Their autistic 6yo admitted to it to me and I went to Mary and said he had said he did it and that it wasn’t my child like they was saying. She flipped her lid. Saying I was lying and blaming their child. It turned into a massive fight. Let me add every single fight and argument, me and my fiancée would try and talk things out like adults with them and Bob would loose his shiz and be screaming at the top of his lungs cursing us and everything. Infront of all the children. I would always have to tell him to stop and send the kids down stairs myself because I didn’t believe they should see this. 

They didn’t believe in eating seconds. But they knew that looked bad to tell a child that’s still Hungary they couldn’t have more. So they do this workout thing that’s called 75 HARD. They made their older son do it and he lost a crap ton of weight and they made their 12 yo do it as well when she was 10-11 yo. She also lost a lot of weight. So if she would ever ask for seconds or even a little bit more of one of the things cooked they would tell her she’s going to get fat and to quit being a piggy. I was astonished and lost for words the first time I heard this. My heart shattered for this child. Watching her face and the light leave her eyes. They was only allowed breakfast lunch and dinner. No such thing as food in between. No such thing as a snack. 

One thing I was able to do for their daughter was do her hair. Her hairs naturally curly but it’s nothing but a frizz ball because they didn’t believe in getting her stuff to do her hair to undamage it. So I would do her hair in a bunch of diffrent hair styles with rubber bands when I would do my daughter’s hair every day. Her mom constantly told her no to doing her hair because she was too busy to do it. (Mind you she was either baking, cooking, or playing a stupid game on her Xbox or computer). Every time she was so excited about her hair and wanted everyone to look at it and see how beautiful she was. Every single time they would tell her she looked ridiculous or looked like a clown. They would tear her down. I learned that they never wanted a daughter and they only wanted boys because girls were too high maintenance and full of drama. Wow right? So they wanted her to be a Tom boy strictly. They told her these things as well. 

One time there was someone stealing and drinking Mary’s creamer for her coffee. They didn’t blame my kids because they knew it was happening before we got there. We had a fridge in the garage and we had creamer of our own and one day I sent their 10yo down to put my creamer back cause he offered to. When he came up I had asked him to smell his breathe to see if he had drank some. He immediately ran to take a drink trying to get the smell off his breathe. But I could still smell it. His dad grabbed him up by his throat and threatened him to tell the truth. He lied. And so I said maybe I was wrong and he let him go. I had no idea he was going to react like that. So his son wound up telling me the truth and I told him his secret was safe with me. He said he would steal sips because he wanted to taste something sweet. 

Mary has some mental issues. One point she found a book with a small rip and lost her shiz on my son for no reason saying she has nightmares every night that my children will destroy their home. Mind you that my children had not messed anything up or broken anything prior to this. They were terrified to even breathe wrong around them. One time my fiancée did some work for an old lady at church and she gave him a tote full of books for my children. While we were outside Mary had went through said books and took some of them and even took some that were worth money and hid them in their office. Their kids told me. I went through them and seperated what I wanted to send back to my children back home and she lost her shiz about it because I shouldn’t be worried about my kids back home apparently. They would go through our trash as well to make sure we wasn’t buying anything from the store they didn’t agree with. Fast food wasn’t allowed. They tell their children that restraunts use baby fetuses to make their meats. 

This all don’t sound horrible and I understand that there is children way worse off then this. I just feel like he runs them like the army and making them work out and work from sun up to sun down is just insane. Not taking them to the Dr when they’re deadly sick. Not taking them out of the house to have human interaction because “95% of the human race is stupid”. The things they say to their children. The way they beat them. I mean their 22yo stays to himself and don’t want nothing to do with them and he’s mentally messed up and admits to wanting to unalive himself every single night. 

It ended with my mom being really sick. I wanted to come back home to be with her because her health wasn’t that great. They threatened to call Dcs on us if we went home. Then she got really really bad where they knew they couldn’t tell me no. We had to promise to come straight back once things were over. We didn’t have a phone because they didn’t believe in it. But I had my old phone that would work with Wi-Fi and they wanted me to contact them and keep them updated. Because Bob was only one allowed to have a phone. He apologized for reacting the way he had before and said he would never keep the kids away from each other or away from us. To come back “home” safely. We left and was gone for a week. My mom got a little better and she checked herself out the hospital against doctors orders. (She does this every time) she had infected bladder, kidneys were infected and even had an abcess. She had ecoli as well that they had just fixed or whatever. She was really sick. So I was going to stay with her for a couple weeks to make sure she went to her follow up appts. 

I got a message saying that we was not allowed back home. That I was a liar I’m guessing because my mom didn’t die like I was afraid of. I wasn’t allowed on their property to get my stuff. Wasn’t allowed in their kids lives. And that I was the worst parents alive because I allowed my kids to believe in stuff Yada Yada. 

There is so much more I could add. Like how their daughter has really bad vision but they won’t take her to get glasses. Pretty sure she has asthma but they won’t take her to get checked out. Their kids have bad cavities. They won’t take them to the dentist. They don’t even know what it’s like to be a child. They get 30 minutes a day to play or watch educational videos or read. The rest is doing chores and so on. Bob says he don’t care about children’s feelings and he definitely don’t care about adults feelings. The kids can’t talk to them about anything including their feelings. Mary even tells them “unless you’re talking to me about business or god I don’t wanna hear about it. 

The children begged me that if we didn’t come back to please call Dcs and get them out of there. I’m not the only one that feels this way. Bobs boss feels the same way. Some church members also do as well. They see past their BS and the daughter has obviously told them some stuff at church. I just need to know what to do please. I’m not sure what to do and I can only imagine these children are thinking I failed them because I left November 1st. And I haven’t talked to them since then. I keep finding little things they made me and I’m dying inside. If I was in a place to take them if Dcs allowed I would but we are currently staying with my older kids dad and his wife while getting on our feet. I need guidance. I don’t know what to do.

How can we evolve and get past our problems like adults?,"Instead of an TLDR you just read the first sentence of each paragraph.

I just need this to work. I have known her since we were 12 years old and I think its the first girl that i truly love. It is also my first serious relationship.

Before I start telling all my problems I have to make one thing clear: Dumping her is not an option. I will try my best to work around our problems and I hope I am mature enough to realise when i truly need to end things.

Please consider as well that things are not dramatic as it seems. I am only telling you the 'bad' side of our relationship

1) Communication is falling off. We are both studying some extremly difficult courses and finals are coming up, so it is understandable that we have limited time. But the problem is that when I call her either two of the following things happen: Either she is on a discord call with her friends and playing LOL, which by itself is a reason to break up (joking of course) or we have a really fun conversation for the first 15 minutes and then dries off into complete silence. I have no idea how to deal with that. The first part really annoys me.

2) Completly different lifestyles. Although that would normaly be a dealbreaker for me, I decided to stay with her because we have the same goals in our later lifes. However, the problem is how we spend our time together right now. What i looooved since I was little, was travelling. I loved going on to mini (or big) adventures with my friends or family and I would love if my girlfriend joined me. The problem is that her family is in financial hardship and cannot afford international trips or stuff like that for now. That is why I dont demand for her to come to me to visit (although she did visit one time with her own money, which I found sweet). But when I am just chilling at her home on uni break we dont do NOTHING. We dont go to grab a coffee or anything. We dont go out to eat. We dont even sit on the balcony and smoke a cigarette while we watch the street. She just lays in bed and wants to binge watch movies, which I enjoy but has gotten boring.

3) Different views on humanity, politics, etc. That is not much of a problem. I always respect what she says, even when I personally believe, that she muttered the most idiotic thing in existance. The thing is that I am more of like a guy of 'nothing ever happens' or 'all potliticians are the same', while she worries and cares a shit ton more about the world and the situation of it. I find that stupid to be honest. Worrying about stuff that you cant control is just taking years off your life, so why bother? Everybody has his own problems and they dont need to add more on top of them, the geopolitical situation of the world right now. Worrying or not will not change the outcome of the war in Ukraine, or the genocide in Gaza, or Trumps policies, or China buying off Africa.

4) Mood swings. Her mood changes faster than a politicians views, once he gets elected. It is absolutely crazy!!! I could speak with her for something nice and you know, have fun, but in the next moment she could be mad at me and I have to guess why, because she wont tell me. I dont even know what else to say at that point. Bonus point: She has admitted that she is aware of that problem and tries to fix it.

5) Septum piercing. I know, I know her body her choice and I completely agree. However, she recenently had a septum piercing that, I find horrendously ugly. I have expressed that I am not necessarily fond of it and she took too personal. Now every time we facetime, she hides it by turning in a way that is covered by her nostrils. I dont demand her to take it out, quite the opposite in fact, i want her to be herself around me, even if that means with a piercing that I dont like.

6) Loves me but does not find me attractive. I completly believe that she loves me with all her heart, even though she does not show it sometimes, but does not find me attracitve. Its not like I am completly chopped or something like that and she did find me attractive at the start of the relationship. Also I always try to behave like a gentleman. I once asked her about it and she admitted that she feels attracted to me only if I am physically there.

7) She never confronts me. I have tried to be as welcoming as possible to her. I have told her multiple times that healthy and measured critisim in a relationship is VERY important and I try to tell her my problems. The thing is that when I say that she should for example 'at least see the reels I send her late at night and dont skip over them' she gets sad for a minute and bends her head down. She values my opinion a lot and I dont know if I should even talk back to her or critise her, because her reactions are not normal. For example she gets distanced and extremly sad for a sec and then ignores everything that happened. I think that has something to do with the mood swings.

Half of those issues I said here could be solved if had a mature and respectful conversation. I already feel like I am married or something and I know that most likely I am not correct on all our issues.

How can I find a solution to each and every one of them like an adult and not like an idiot?

I do not know how to really do this.

Im in my 30s, after spending most of my life in an alt scene and getting involved with people that never matured or willingly seek mental health help, I am really wanting and needing to shake things up. Im in a grey city where theres a disproportionately large amount of depressed people and it was hard to make friends here.

Im a musician and artist, and both lifestyles and scenes seems to both attract a fair amount of people with lifestyles I don't really gel with anymore (heavy partying, heavy drinking, lamenting, etc and also want to note that not everyone is like that but its super hard to sift through that pile). I so deeply just want a solid, quality friend group that I can meet up with and get nice dinner and drinks with, go do yoga with, coffee shop dates, etc. Right now, Im leaning way too hard on two long distance friends for consolation right now haha.

I know we're all busy, some people are having  kids and others will get lost in the relationship sauce; life catches up to us. But I feel very motivated to find this friend group.

I really had a bad time using ""Bumble BFF"" and ""meetup"" and do not like to use these apps. I always see people dropping in comments like ""join a rock climbing gym (I do not want to rock climb!), go on a nature meetup hike (I really don't want to do this and prefer my nature time to be alone)"" stuff like this.

I like bookstores, art, coffee, yoga, willing to try new things like pilates, weightlifting, nerd/gaming groups, etc.

Anecdotally, I somehow have realized that whenever you meet one really good person you gel with and they introduce you to their friends, to me that seems to have been the actual most helpful thing for making friends.

I feel so weird asking for ""hey I've literally never had problems making friends until my 30s happened and suddenly this is a huge issue"".

Chiang Mai- Mecca of coffee , literally every street had a specialty coffee shop . It has a store called Roas8ry and their team is World Barista champion consistently

Akha Ama- Top notch, mind was blown tasting charcoal in coffee

Blue Coffee - Another good one

Basecamp cafe - Decent

Graph Coffee- Decent but pricey

A small roastery i don’t recall anymore - decent but the place had so much character , vinyl music themed

Ministry of Roasters- very average coffee but really fresh orange cake

Stories - Decent coffee

Foei - Very good

Bangkok

Songwat Road coffee roasters ( Bangkok) - life changing dirty coffee

Old Town Cafe ( Bangkok) - Great coffee and the coolest aesthetic 

I also discovered Dirty coffee and coconut water coffee (on the street on Bangkok) which was probably my highlights of the trip. Also tried Mango tea whipped cheese which was top notch . 

The coffee/ drinks culture of Thailand is miles ahead ! I still haven’t tasted anything like that in India ! Happy to get some references where i can find Chiang Mai level coffee in this country!

Why is no one doing that kind of work in India.  Honestly all coffee in Bombay cafés taste mostly the same , no distinction or notes

Hey loves! I'm based in New England, and hoping to meet someone who enjoys good banter, shared adventures, and doesn't take life too seriously.

A little about me: I love reading, traveling, and checking out local food spots (I'm definitely a foodie). Coffee shops, food trucks, breweries, art museums, and pottery studios are all my thing. I hike, work out, run half marathons, swim, and spend as much time near the beach as I can. I'm a bit chubby right now, but I'm actively working on it - gym, running, and discipline included. I'm also a homebody, I enjoy good movies.

I'm currently in school for cybersecurity until June, so life is busy but exciting. I'm planning on moving to Massachusetts, though I'm open to staying in CT or RI for the right situation.

I enjoy board games, billiards, watching sports, sarcasm, and witty remarks. If you can dish it out and take it, we'll probably get along just fine. I love to laugh.

Physically: I'm 5'1, petite, olive skin, brunette with some blonde, sleeve tattoos.

I'm deaf, but don't worry, you can sing as off-key as you want. I'll be your hype girl and tell you you're the best singer anyway.

I'm looking for someone emotionally available, kind, and communicative - someone who enjoys the things I mentioned and appreciates good banter and witty remarks. Not into games, just something genuine, steady, and fun. Please don't message me if you can't keep the conversation flowing or ghost after 2 days. And don't message me if you're looking for hookups.

What I'm looking for:

• 30-50s, located in the U.S. or Canada (possibly open to Europe for the right connection)

• Kid-free - I don't have children and want to date someone who's also child-free

• Emotionally available, communicative, and consistent

• Enjoys sarcasm, good banter, and can keep up with witty remarks

• Active or at least supportive of an active lifestyle

• Open-minded and respectful

I'm white/mixed and tend to date outside my race; typically Asian, but chemistry matters most, so shoot your shot. Be sure to attach your photo, and don't write just ""hey"".

If you made it to the end, congrats! Your attention span passed the test. Send a message with a little effort. Food recs, hiking stories, or questionable music choices encouraged. Bonus points if you can keep up with sarcasm.",4,1768673289.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

**PS:** We were very well aware that we couldn't cover the entire city in the span of 3 days, given our itinerary included the Sundarbans Tour & a Cricket Match which were non-negotiable. We also regret on missing out the Belur Math / Dakshineshwar Temple since we were running low on time; also we didn't cover anything in the Salt Lake area ie, the Planned City, since we were more inclined towards the Historic Sight Seeing areas; and the trip definitely reminded us how much Kolkata owed to the pre-Independent India, and how it could've become the Capital of India.

# Day 1:

* We arrived at the Kolkata Airport that morning, installed & created profile on the **Aamar Kolkata Metro App**, took the underground metro from Jai Hind Station (Yellow) towards Rabindra Sadan (Blue) since that's where our Lodge was booked for - in the Park Street Area. The yellow line wasn't much crowded, since it is a new line is what I heard from the locals in the metro there, but once we stepped in to the Blue Line Train, that is when it dawned upon us about how the crowd is - it was 9:40^(ish) in the morning: there were youth & adults heading to their work, then amass of Indian Test Jerseys heading to Esplanade to cheer India in the 1^(st) Test against SA. (PS: We booked tickets for the 3^(rd) Day, Sunday, which is when the most action is).
   * Reached the lodge an hour before Check-In time, so the Receptionist collected extra for early check-in; well, we had to buy-in since we felt we're losing time already.
   * We're also amused that the Roads in the Park Street Area have a clock-based directions: like 7 Hours a day One-Way, then for the next 7 Hours One-Way the opposite direction, and the remaining hours (mostly night to early morning) operating Bi-Directionally.
* We first headed to the famous **Kusum Rolls**, at least as for what we're recommended, and were blown up in a positive way, I remember the item costed us 100Rs, but don't remember now as to what item it was exactly, maybe an Egg Chicken Roll :/. They were very filling for a meal, hot & tasty to the point indeed, this set the bar for us about the variety Kolkata has to offer us.
   * Speaking of Park Street, it does appear busy throughout the day, with Book Sellers, Souvenir Sellers, students popping up during Lunch Time; the Colonial British Architecture buildings is preserved, and that's what makes this side of Kolkata unique. Footpaths also appeared wide, which could be the reason it appears flooded by people round the clock maybe 😉.
* Our first destination in the checklist was the **Victoria Memorial**, we went by a Cab, although it was just \~2km away, we didn't want to run out of energy. Spent a proper 1 Hour in the site, clicking pictures, going through the presented history, the extended halls, and the fountains.
* Then, around 2PM, we reached the **St. Paul Cathedral**, we went by walk as it seemed close-by. We spent around 30mins, initially we did think of clicking pics, but due to the Afternoon time, the Sun was causing a shadow from over the Church & our faces were getting dull, so we skipped it. We checked the interiors of the Church in about 15-20 mins, also we should be maintaining silence, & cannot click pics inside the Prayer Hall as well.
* Up next, we walked another 1.5km to the **Netaji's Bhawan**, which was also a supposedly calm place, and pictures weren't supposed to be clicked within the Bhawan. It was really a nice experience inside the Bhawan; re-learning his accomplishments & sacrifices for an Independent India. Also, the Bhawan is being run by the Ancestors of the Netaji and funded by them for the annual maintenance of the property, which answered as to how the articles were preserved so clean & neat. The Bhawan also featured the *Red Marked footsteps supposedly of the Netaji who was running from his bedroom to flee from a house attack - and this was the last he stayed in the Bhawan.* Overall, we spent around 45mins.
* Then, we also had to collect our Test Match Tickets for 3rd Day & took a cab to the Eden Gardens since the Physical Collection Stalls were arranged there. It was 4PM by the time we reached there. It was a mess, infuriated locals yelling all-around on District, and the Ticket Distribution Reps: since they stopped distribution post 4:00PM sharp, even though the text message reminders mentioned that we could collect the tickets by 6PM.
   * A bit disappointed, since this also disturbed our itinerary for the next days, we didn't bother it much, and went to board the Underground Metro from Esplanade (Purple) towards Howrah Metro Station (other side of the Hooghly River), just to experience an under-water Metro Ride, although we did know that we cannot see real water, it was just blue lights. Even this Metro Ride was very crowdy, as people were returning back from work 🫤.
   * We reached the other side of the river & came out at around 5:15pm at the Howrah Railway Station side, and to our surprise, we were shocked since the Sun had already set. (I know, Kolkata's to the East, & in Winters the Sunset is early, but 5pm is too early 😑) ... We wanted to check the Sunset, at least the Sky Hues, but missed that. Nevertheless, we wanted to see what's around the Howrah Bridge: it is actually very crowdy at that time of the day, since people were returning back from work, many people heading to the Howrah Railway Station, then many waiting for the Boats to head to Kolkata, from Howrah side & vis-a-vis. It appeared to be some sort of a Vegetable Market just underneath the Howrah side of the Bridge, *we did want to have the famous* ***Pani Puri,*** *but the area this side didn't look that neat*, so we just wanted to leave back to Kolkata side.
   * We then **boarded a boat from Howrah Side, towards Kolkata**; and got down at the **Babu Ghat** around 6PM. The boat ride in the evening was mesmerizing as well: with a well-lit Howrah Bridge, the SBI Building, & a river side Bar were having good border lights, and the reflections from water were adding to even more beauty tbh 😊.
* We were suggested to try the **Chinese Cuisine** here, since there were colonial residents from the North-East who stayed back here post-Independence, and we could enjoy this, a bit more Authentic, just 2nd to the ones that North-East offers. So, we decided to take a cab towards **Tangra**, as we found some Chinese Restaurants to be present that side. On a quick surf online, we found **Kim-Fa Restaurant** nearer to where we got dropped in Tangra and went for some snack-kind of meal. We had **some Chicken Chinese Starter**, & then a **Double Egg Fried Rice**, they're good - and don't contain much oil as well. But I'm sure there are better places, & better options to try in Kolkata for Chinese Cuisine, it was a lack of information we had to end up with what I've mentioned. Then we headed back to Part Street via Cab.
* Park Street really looked like a happening spot in the evening / night hours. The cross-roads were filled with people walking across, hell lot of vehicles parked in front of the outlets. There were even Street Musicians performing across the Footpaths who attracted many people.
   * We checked at the waiting time at **Mocambo** & **Peter Cat**; and decided to go with the Peter Cat Restaurant as it appeared quick in terms of movement. In the meantime, we were just strolling around the crossroads, but then, we encountered a >!Prostitute !<who was continuously advertising herself, and suggesting some spot, but as we weren't locals, we didn't understand what she meant; and just tried to avoid her, but she was a bit adamant; it really took us some walking to another road until we got rid of her, it was a bit sad & scary at the same moment. We also found that **Flurys** was a good dessert spot post-dinner and kept that for ending our day.
   * Once the desired tables were vacant, we went into **The Peter Cat Restaurant** and ordered their **Special Chelo Kababs & Veg Nentara Curry**. Tbf, this was the best form of Chicken Meat I've ever tasted 😋, myself being a Vegetarian, I'd definitely suggest anyone to try these. The Chicken's cooked - soft on-point - it'd beat all your past experiences of having Chicken, the Nentara Curry was also delicious, which made us conclude that these guys know the correct level of spiciness to add to their dishes, not overdoing. We liked them a lot that we repeated the order.
   * Then, we were so full that we skipped Flurys for another day. Just ended the current day by some window shopping over the footpath and ended up purchasing some **Fridge Magnets** in Park Street Area itself.

# Day 2:

* This day was dedicated completely for the Sundarbans itself. We booked well-in advance for Boat Ride at the Sundarbans online. We went ahead with **Sundarban Eco Tourism (Contact: +917003726306)**. They charged us 8000Rs in total for 3 friends, which included pick-up / drop from Lodge via their Carrier Vehicles; Breakfast, Lunch & Snacks - freshly prepared & served on the Boat itself. Sadly, there were no kind of discounts for me even though I was a Vegetarian.
   * The pick-up guy called us a day before for the Lodge Location, & asked to us to be ready by 5AM in the morning, since we were supposed to reach by 7:30AM - at the Gadkhali Ghat as far as I could recollect 🤔.
   * We got ready by 4:50AM and got into the Pick-Up Car (Toyota Innova, since there were as another couple he had to pickup at the Salt Lake Side). This Pick-Up Car Driver was like an F1 Racer, very fast, cruising as if he's not even scared of the Kolkata Traffic Police - someone with Balls of Steel 😭... and dropped us by 7:40AM.
   * We got into the Boat / Ferry, which was like 2 Storyed: accommodating about 40-45 Tourists, 1 Tour Guide, and about 5-6 members to look after the Ferry Hospitality and sailing the Ferry. and the Ferry started its journey by 8AM.
   * The 1^(st) Stop for the Ferry appeared very quickly, which was the **Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary**. Here we could spot some crocodiles & turtles, and also the Tour Guide, who's completed her Higher Education in MSc Geography, was explaining about the Flora & Fauna of the spot - which also included the **Sundari Trees.**
   * On boarding back, we were getting the hang of the tour, a bit of peace, and then were served **Breakfast** at around 9:40AM **(Fresh & Hot Pooris, Aaloo Curry, 1 Rasgulla, Tea)** \- which were all very good, there was nothing which was disappointing in this meal.
   * Up next, around 10:20AM, we reached the 2^(nd) Stop - the **Sudhanyakhali Beat**, which also had some great Flora being talked about, a Tribe of Monkeys at the Entrance & Exits, and a Light House for an aerial view of the location. The Tourist Guide explained about some flowers which were growing in this Beat, & how the Honey produced here is one of the finest - International Export Quality kinda.
   * Post boarding back the Ferry, we started to venture into the narrower regions of the Delta, could see the Mangroves, dry shores - a bit of footprints of Tigers (supposedly), now it was a 2.5Hr long Ferry Ride, completely stationary tourists, all talking amongst their own groups; some getting to the lower floor to click pics, getting some shade in the arranged beds. Meanwhile, we spotted some Deers and Birds (obviously the rare ones which we don't spot in cities). Meanwhile, one of the Boat Operators made us purchase a Honey Bottle (500ml for 400Rs) out of FOMO, saying that it was of Premium Quality, gave us a few drops to taste, it was good, but I couldn't recollect how other Honeys taste, so couldn't compare the quality.
   * We were served with **Green Tea & Snacks (Veg Pakoda & Ketchup - with refills)**, which wasn't bad, a good appetizer to kill the time according to them.
   * Then around 1:15PM, we reached the 3^(rd) Stop: **The Dobanki Camp**, which was the Final Halt. This one was completely built on top of the dry portions of the Delta, by a railing bridge to walk on, we could spot some tiny Red Crabs that were fighting on the dry ground, but had to zoom around 13x to even properly spot them :LOL, then we also spotted some more Deer's in this spot, and then boarded the Ferry back around 1:40PM.
   * At around 2PM, they arranged the tables in the Ferry for Lunch and served both Veg / Non-Veg varieties: **Dal Curry, Rice, Keera / Onion Salad, Fried Banana Pakoda, (Paneer Curry, Aloo Cauliflower Curry for the Veg), (Fish Curry, Crab Curry for the Non-Vegetarians)** was served. I did enjoy the Veg Cuisine, and as per a Tamilian Couple - the Fish Curry was delicious, and the Crabs served were smaller than the usual ones, but they enjoyed the Non-Veg Cuisine as well. As per them, the Fish wasn't creating any smell / odor in the Ferry and were impressed by the Cooking Staff in proper Cooking Standards, and the Quality of Ingredients used throughout the day, that was some first-hand review I could gather from someone who's aware of the challenges faced in serving Sea Food.
   * Now, it was all about patience, many of them went into post-lunch slumber, some like me were still hoping to spot a Tiger 🐯, but only its footprints were found :(. These final 2.5 Hrs it was completely in the very beginning of Bay Of Bengal, it was all covered by Water 4 sides, with many other Ferries alongside ours.
   * Finally, at 4:45PM, we got off the Ferry - *though I wasn't very satisfied since I couldn't spot a single Tiger*, and our F1 Racer called us to share his location, then we got in & started at 5PM, to Kolkata, specifically the Park Street, for Dinner, since he'd dropping us at around 8:50PM.
* At exactly 9PM, we reached the **Balaram Mullick Sweet Shop** in the Park Street, the shutter already half-closed, the security weren't allowing us inside. We pleaded and tried to convince them, saying that we were tourists, alongside us, were another couple, who came at 9:13PM, and that lady was literally crying, begging to be let in, since they've a flight to catch, look at the Aura Farming of these guys 🫡.
   * Finally, we were let in, bought **Sandesh & Milk Rasgullas** \- which were Out of this World 🤩... They were huge, soft, and rightly very sweet as well. No doubt they definitely need to farm Aura, although the closing time was 9:30PM in Google Maps, and we reached 30mins prior only.
* Then, for Dinner, we went to **Arsalan Restaurant, Park Street**; which was much talked about. We ordered **Chicken Biryani & Mutton Biryani.** Although I only had Chicken Biryani, and found it nice - but wasn't much the hype for me, since it also had Aaloos, but maybe this is what is authentic for the locals here. My friends liked the Mutton Biryani, so everyone returned back with a Happy & Satisfied Tummy 😮‍💨.

# Day 3:

* We got up around 4AM, a bit drowsy upar se, but had to do it, since we'd to Check-Out at 11AM only, but that wasn't possible for us, so packed in by 5AM, and left the luggage in the Reception, and checked-out, so that we could collect them in the evening, to which the Receptionist agreed, finally, to something, and he didn't ask for extra money :).
* We wanted to cover either of Dakshineshwar Temple (North Kolkata) / Kalighat Temple (South Kolkata), and our itinerary ke hisaab se, our choice was the **Kalighat Temple**, for which we took the Black Ambassdor Taxi, reached around 5:45AM only, but we were wearing Jeans - TShirts, & all 3 of us being Male Bachelors in appearance, the Vendors spotted an easy prey to loot us 😔.
   * Even though the Temple was open, with disciples going in for Darshan; they stopped us, making fool that we couldn't enter because the Temple opens at 6AM sharp.
   * Then at 6AM as well, 1 vendor wouldn't let us go in, asking for an Entry Fee of 100Rs per head (which was all non-sense) - or paying him handful so that he escorts us within the Temple Darshan. We ended up taking his help in escorting us within the Temple, the Darshan was Super-Fast, not at all a Holy Experience, and within the main chamber, while offering the Red Hibiscus Flowers to the Matha, the Head Poojari told that we should be paying 500Rs for Darshan, which was absurd again, and the people were completely hostile / unfair, just because our Hindi was not up to the mark 🙂...
   * After coming outside, we wanted to take some pics near the temple, at least 1 pic our Parents would like to see - ""*their kids going to Temple first thing in the morning*""; but there were a lot of Dogs within the surroundings of the Temple, that my friend got scared, and told to go out of the area.
   * *Also, it came as a shocker to us, since off all the tourist places, we were getting scammed at a Temple. It goes without a rule that we always have our Guard-Up during tourism, but then hawkers outside the Temple choose to loot you, didn't feel happy on seeing this* 🤧\*.\*
* We wanted a clear image of the **Howrah Bridge**, so we took a cab from near the Temple, to the Howrah Railway Station, clicked some pics of the Bridge; and then, boarded the 1st Boat from Howrah Bridge side to Babu Ghat. Since it was the 1st ride of the day, there was a huge crowd: working population, test match viewers - who came from distant areas to Howrah -> finally to reach Kolkata, and the boats were fully loaded.
   * This time we could take good pics of the Bridge and also enjoy some morning sunlight. There were 3 Boats which arranged in some sort of *Interstellar's Docking Scene*, and people were hopping from one boat to another, based on their destination on the opposite side. and then, we finally got down at the Babu Ghat side.
   * Now, it was a jogging spree from Babu Ghat to the Eden Gardens' Ticket Collection Area - with about 300 others, at 8AM in the morning 😂 who were just as eager as us, to get into the Stadium.
* Finally, we collected our tickets at 8:30AM, and headed to **Eden Gardens, Block J (tickets costed 160Rs / head on District, post some offers).** Got seated, took some pics at the Iconic Eden Gardens 🤠, headed to get some Water Packets & Snacks, since the match starts at 9:30AM.
   * We bought a bag of 10 Water Packets, but this is where I warn everyone, the water caused 2 of us some bad throat pain which we had to endure post trip for a week, just saying.
   * Then, I believe it was Dale Steyn who rang the bell at 9:30AM to commence the day's play; and SA's batmen along with Team India comes out.
   * Being seated in Block J, the Sun was over our head, and we had to consume the water packets, which then evolved into throat pain later in the evening, due to which, we planned a hard-stop at 11:00AM, no matter the condition of the game.
   * Bumrah gets the 1^(st) Wicket of the day on his 1^(st) Ball of the 2^(nd) Over, and the Stadium erupts 🤯, the still crowd finally starts to roar, no one's seated, everyone's jumping in joy, although it wasn't Temba's Wicket, but everyone enjoyed the moment.
   * We came out at 10:50AM, since we wanted to click some pics in-front of **The Cricket Association of Bengal** hoarding, which had a Wall-of-Fame of Ganguly, Kapil Dev, Virat, MSD etc., and took single pics here :).
* Then at around 11AM, we booked a cab to the **Jorasanko Thakur Bari (Birth House of Rabindranath Tagore Ji)**, but just when we were getting in the cab, we hear roars from within the stadium, since at this point the SA Team were all-out, but we couldn't witness it, since we'd other places to cover as well.
   * Thakur Bari was very quiet, no bags were allowed inside, & photography was also prohibited within the premises. We explored the rooms of the house, which had hoardings & hangings of some stories of Tagore Ji.
   * There was also very faint sound being played within the premises, which seems to be a collection of his Poems only (Sorry, I couldn't look up the details, it must be Gitanjali which was being played afaik) ...
   * There was one main open hall area, this is the only place where photography was allowed, although it was with a 50Rs Fee.
* Overall, we spent around 40mins, a bit in a rush I believe, but we were also hungry, so headed over to **The Indian Coffee House** by walk, around 1.6km from Thakur Bari. We dined in the Main Floor, with around 30 other small tables on all 4 directions to ours. We ordered some starters, Fried Rice, Hakkah Noodles, & Tea - comprising of about 2 meals for the day at one go.
   * The atmosphere here was very different, a unique experience imo, the place featured people of all sorts, age, demographic etc.
   * We found Students: coming in individually, as gangs, as couples; then Older Aged Uncles - with newspapers in hand, and topics to talk in their mind; we also spotted some guys with cameras recording themselves, or other strangers.
   * But, I felt a bit suffocating due to the closed environment, it was a bit smoky because of the cooking going on, then some uncles were smoking as well, although it was a place that was preserved since Pre-Independence it seems, and people even that time used to come here in groups, for discussions and mob activities as I heard.
* In fact, this region of **Bankim Chatterjee Street - College Street**, has a lot of college students, book stalls, and a lot of *Foreign Tourist Footfall* as well; as we spotted many people in the Thakur Bari / Coffee House / Vivekananda Home as well; which speaks as to how impactful the teachings of figures like Swami Vivekananda & Rama Krishna were, at a Global Level, that too during the Pre-Independence time itself 🙏🏻...
* Post Lunch, we headed over to **Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House & Cultural Centre**, which is partly a Museum, along with the Swami's Home behind it.
   * The 1st Floor in the Museum features a Theatre Room which plays some anecdotal instances of Swamiji in an animated format.
   * Then we headed on to the other rooms in the building - showcasing his stories, the path to his enlightenment, his relationship with Rama Krishna Ji; and the experience is something similar to the one in Thakur Bari, very peaceful and pleasant.
   * Here as well, we spotted some foreign tourists, and a merchandise store selling various kinds of articles with Swami's quotes on them.
   * The Centre looked to be undergoing some renovation and didn't allow us to go to the Top Floor.
* Then, we headed over for some Saree Shopping for our moms, we were suggested of the Jamdhani Sarees which were the more popular ones in Kolkata, but then, we didn't go with them since one of my friends said that we may not be the best choosers of what our moms would like, and suggested that we go for something that we're sure of them liking it, so went ahead and chose something they already have, but just a token of love. We went to **the Saree Hub**, located in Thalthala area, closer to the Park Street, this was *because* we also had to do some other shopping here.
* We headed to **Balaram Mullick** for 1 last time, to purchase some Rasgulla Bottles to take home, and got them packed so that they're travel-safe. Additionally, we also tasted the **Nolen Gur Rasgulla**, made of Jaggery, and this was even better the regular one, it was naturally sweet - not too punchy like the regular one, but the packaged bottles weren't available since the season was about to begin is what they said.
* Then, we enroute back to the Lodge, to pack the Sarees, Shopping Articles & Rasgulla Bottles, and headed to the Airport by Metro. This time we were even luckier, as it wasn't jam packed within the metro.",2,1768673176.0,india_tourism,3,1.0,False

[Turin Legato V2]","I've just begun working with my Turin Legato V2. It's been great. I dialed in my grind on my Eureka, pressure great at 9 bars on the Turin Legato, flow set at about 7ml/second.

My pull is 1:2 (18 grams coffee to 36grams/ml) out--all dialed in on the manual setting with a scale to measure output. I get tasty espresso at about 30 seconds.

I set up my preinfusion/presoak for 5 seconds, with a 5 second pause. These are set on the machine as P1 and P2. Those two settings account for a total of 10 seconds. Do I now set up my automatic for a total of 40 seconds (the dialed in 30 seconds above figured out on manual brew) *plus* the additional 10 seconds at the beginning of automatic for presoak and pause (the bloom)?

***OR*** do I do another dial in process with a scale under the automatic output to hit my 36 grams (watching output weight and the timer )to find that sweet spot time-wise?

In the end, though having fun--it will be about taste. I can say that adding ten seconds to the manual time worked and tasted good but instead of a 36 gram pull I had about 46 grams of output. (this is all on the automatic setting).

1qfk5se,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_scottjohnday/comments/1qfk5se/rf_thomas_wolfe_the_finale_part_2/,[RF] Thomas Wolfe: The Finale Part 2,"Tom had stopped by the grocery store to pick up a few items they needed for their dinner. As he was shopping he noticed a lady frantically adding the cost of the items in her cart, then returning some items to the shelf. From the items she had it was obvious that she had children, but was short on money. She struck Tom as being a professional person that was having a hard time. Tom had a flashback of his grandmother talking about when after his grandfather had died, when his father was young and she was short of money, how a kind stranger stepped in and helped her buy groceries. She still remembered that decades later. Tom quickly came up with a plan.
     
Tom approached her and said that he had been assigned by his company to buy food for a family with children, but realized he had no idea what kids would like. Would she be able to help him? She agreed and they started to go through the isles selecting items. As they walked Tom asked her about her children. They were 8 and 7 and in school. It was difficult for them because their father had left suddenly and she was trying to find a job but was having trouble finding a job that fit with her kids schedule. After they finished shopping, the shopping cart was heaped with groceries. Tom paid for everything then told her the groceries were actually for her. He gave her his card and said that this place was hiring. If she could stop by tomorrow, they opened the doors at 8. 
     
The next morning Tom mentioned to Suzy that a lady may stop by for an application. When Suzy unlocked the doors, Pam was waiting outside. She came in and filled out the application. While she was sitting there filling out an application, Suzy had answered the phone a few times. As Suzy was walking back to Tom's office, the phone started to ring. As she started to run back to her desk, Pam answered the phone. Pam greeted the person just as Suzy had, and after a pause said “Mr. Wolfe is not available. Would you like to leave a message?” in a very professional way.  She was hired and turned out to be one of his key employees and completely took care of the front office, freeing Suzy to help Tom more. Tom asked Pam if she knew of anyone that would be interested in working with them. She knew several. It was a good thing because they were becoming extremely busy.

Tom had found that there were many investors that wanted to control their investments themselves, but wanted his advice. So for these, Tom started a daily advice post. He would give brief advice on stocks that should be watched, bought, or dropped. This developed until he had over 1000 top tier investors that were paying him $1000 a month for his advice. Besides that he managed the investments for his regular clients. 

Tom continued this daily post for decades. It was something that he loved so it was not a chore. He always checked the market every day anyway, so it only took a few moments to summarize it. It actually gave him great pleasure.0 

Everyone would often gather around the fire pit in the garden in the evenings.  One evening Tim was obviously distressed. He related that the paper he had worked for all this time was shutting down. The owner, who was also the editor, had found out that he had cancer that had spread throughout his body. He was putting everything in order. 

Tom asked if anything could be done? Tim said that a couple of different investors had made offers, but the owner knew they would break it up and sell off the pieces. He would rather close it up rather than have that happen. The owner's only demand was that it continue as it was and not be chopped up. He had put too much sweat and blood into it for that to happen. He would close it first. The owner gave a price and when Tom ran through all the numbers, they added up so Tom bought it and Tim became the managing partner and the Chief editor of the paper.

One day Tom told Betsy that he would really like to develop a vineyard on the property. She simply asked why didn't he? He didn't have a good answer as to why not, so decided to investigate it. Everything seemed to be lining up except for one thing, for him to take on the project, he wanted Jean Pierre to help him. 
    
When Jean Pierre visited he agreed to help set up the vineyard. They started by clearing the oak trees. They used the trees to build the wine barrels. Then they laid out the rows for the vines and prepared the supports. They set up the irrigation system and were ready to plant the vines. 

It turned out that the lower level of the factory was perfect for the winery. There was more room than they would ever need, and it was built with a passive ventilation system that kept the air fresh, but maintained the same temperature year round. He decided to name it Oak Knolls Vineyards. Things were coming together. Then he and Betsy received unexpected news. 

They were expecting their first baby. They then were busy setting up the nursery. They soon found out that it was going to be a boy. They couldn't wait to share the news. Bob was scheduled to be in the City on business so they invited him to come to Oak Knolls for a Sunday dinner with Tom's parents. When everyone sat down at the table, Tom and Betsy stood together. ""We have an announcement. You are going to be grandparents."" The room erupted. 

They told everyone that it was a boy, and his name would be Thomas Victor Wolfe lll. There wasn't much food eaten, but there was a lot of conversation. Needless to say, everyone was thrilled. Bob sat back and looked at his daughter. He had never seen her so happy in his life. That gave him deep satisfaction and comfort but also a deep sense of gratitude.

Now more than ever, Tom was wanting to stay closer to home.
When Betsy was at her desk, he went in and sat in front of her. She could tell something was on his mind, so asked what it was. He started by saying that he had been thinking a lot recently. With his schedule that he had been keeping and the travel, he didn't think he could be the type of father he wanted to be, the type of father that he had.

He could let his key people have more leeway. He had trained them well and he could let them do their job without his hovering over them. He could reduce his travel by half and they would be fine. 
    
The nursery was completed and ready for Tommy's arrival. Next Tom turned his attention to a play area at the lake. He had several truck loads of sand brought in to create a sandy beach. Next he had a dock built into the lake. He wanted to be able to teach his son to sail, so the dock would come in handy. With that completed, he started to stock the lake with fish. What boy didn't love to go fishing? Now he was ready to be the Dad he wanted to be. 

When it was close to the time for the baby to be due, Betsy asked her Dad and Grandparents to come up from Texas for a visit so they could be close for the arrival. It would mean a lot to her. They soon made all the arraignments and arrived a few days before the due date. 

There was a lot of discussion as to if Tommy would show up on time or if he would delay his entrance. They weren't kept guessing long. In the early afternoon after everyone arrived, Betsy went into labor. Six hours later, a very healthy baby boy was born. Tom would never forget the moment he saw his baby boy for the first time. The emotions that welled up in him.

Tom couldn't take his eyes off of him. He was perfect. His entire life, the struggles and disappointments that he had endured all seemed insignificant at this moment. Betsy had come through with flying colors and Tommy was announcing his presence to the world, loudly. Tom went out to the family and just hugged each one of them. He could not come up with any words, but they understood. 

Tom was told that Betsy needed some rest and would not be allowed any visitors until tomorrow. He should go home and get some rest himself. He went home but he didn't get any sleep. He didn't realize how much one event could change your life so drastically. Even how he thought about things now seemed to change. 

He was in the kitchen having some coffee when Bob came in. Tom wasn't the only one having trouble sleeping. He offered Bob a cup of coffee. Tom then said that may not be what he wanted at four in the morning. Bob then sat down with Tom and started talking of the feelings of responsibility that comes with being a parent. “You try to give your children the best foundation you can, then you send them out into the world and just hope that they remember some of what you tried to teach them.”

“Don't worry about everything you say to them. Regrets are part of what being a parent is all about. We all wish that we had said this differently or did this then. Don't worry about all that. Just show your children all the love you can and that is what they will remember, not what you said this time or that. They will remember the love you showed them throughout their life.”

Tom thought about his parents and realized that Bob was right. What he remembered was the love they had always given him. He could do that. He may not always be the perfect parent, but he could show his son love. It gave him great peace of mind. It was the advice that he needed so much at that time.

They talked until the sun rose and it was time to return to the hospital to visit Betsy and Tommy. Tom had always liked Bob but it was the talk they had that morning where they really bonded. 

That afternoon, Tom took Bob and Tex around the property and showed them what he was doing. He took them into the winery and showed them how wine barrels were being made from the oak trees cleared for the vineyard. He then took them to the upper level and explained that this was a munitions factory during World War ll. The winery would never use all the room on the lower level so he wasn't sure what to do with this level. He then showed them the beach and the dock and explained the purpose. He then showed them the hiking trails he was creating. Bob and Tex were impressed. They invited Tom to bring his family to the ranch. Tom promised that as soon as Tommy was able to travel he would bring them for a visit.

When Tommy was a year old, they visited the ranch. Tom wasn't sure what he was expecting, but it wasn't this. The ranch was over ten thousand acres that had several lakes. It included flat pasture ground and went back into the mountains. The main house was tucked in next to the base of the mountain. It was a modern log home with a western theme. Down closer to the barn and corrals was a large guest lodge. 

Tom had the experience of being on a horse for the first time in his life. When Tom said he didn't know how to ride a horse, the old ranch hand helping him chuckled. “Don't worry about it. The horse is smart. It knows what to do. All you need to worry about is staying in the saddle.""

When it was time to leave, both he and Betsy hated to go. Tom couldn't believe it had taken so long to make it out to the ranch. But they had to get back to work.

The support staff Tom now required was overwhelming the office. Tom had brought in a legal team and a large accounting department. He was now considering acquiring additional office space close to his existing office when it hit him what to do. He had the upper level above the winery that he could convert into offices. 

What Tom decided to do was to replace the shop building over the old factory. He designed it to be three stories above the factory. On the ground floor was a tasting room and an office for Oak Knoll Vineyard. At the same time an entry directly into the winery on the bottom level was excavated. 

Most of his employees would go to the beach area during their lunch or take a hike on the trails. They loved being out of the City and started feeling healthier and less stressed. Then they found the prices for housing were half of what they were in the City for much nicer places. The workers then asked about having a day-care there. They thought their children would benefit from being out of the City also. 
    
Tom talked to Betsy about it and they thought it was a great idea.  They both loved having children around and Tommy would have plenty of friends to play with. 
So for their next project they built a day care facility for the worker’s children. The focus was  hands-on learning. Being able to touch the things they were learning about. Tommy loved having other children his age around.
    
One thing the children enjoyed the most was when local artists were invited out and explained their form of art and then gave them instructions on how to do it. With painters, the children were given the chance to paint. With a sculptor, the children were given clay to work with. With music, they were allowed to strum a guitar or play a violin. 

This turned out to be the basis of how Tom and Betsy came to raise their own children. They not only taught them about something, they had them experience it. From trips to the ranch to vacations in France or other places, each was used as a teaching experience. Not to just see the sights, but to experience the culture.

Two years after Tommy, Tom and Betsy had a daughter, Mary Francis. Another cause for a large family celebration. It was a year after Mary Francis that Robert Simon was born, whom they called Bobby. It was interesting for them to see the personalities emerge as the children started growing. Tommy was quiet and studious like Thomas. Mary was the artist. She loved anything to do with drawing or painting. Bobby was the social one who loved playing pranks on his siblings. 
    
Now Jean Pierre was spending about half his time at Oak Knolls looking after the vineyard and painting. Mary was always hanging around her ""Uncle Jean"". Tom was concerned she may be making a pest of herself, but Jean Pierre wouldn't have it any other way. He taught her all about paints, how to create different colors, how to create emotion in a painting, and how to view light and create shadows for dramatic effect. Jean Pierre loved being able to share his passion, and Mary loved learning all about it. Mary started to develop into an accomplished artist. 
    
All the children were taught to work from an early age. They were given tasks around the office. At first it would be dumping the trash and then worked up to assisting someone with a project. When it came time for them to go to college, they were offered the same deal that the worker’s children were offered. They could choose the school they wanted, but they were required to attend all classes, maintain at least a B or higher average, and were to work for the company for five years after graduation. After that, they were free to do what they wanted. 
    
Tommy decided to go to Harvard and get an MBA like his Dad had. It didn't surprise him when Mary chose a smaller Arts based college. When it was Bobby's turn, he chose Harvard for a law degree. 
   
Tommy was the obvious choice to take over the day to day operations of Vector Investments. He was the one that started to take care of the personal visits to the companies. Tom stressed the need to go in low key, not like a big shot. And make sure to talk with the rank and file employees, not just the management team.
    
Bobby became the head of Investor Relations and Legal Affairs when he graduated. He loved the City and moved into the apartment above the office. He had the responsibility of supervising the care of all the legal issues and also entertaining the investors, addressing any of their concerns, and developing new investors. He was very good at his job. 
    
When Mary graduated after four years, instead of pursuing an advanced degree she spent two years in France developing as an artist. She painted on the streets of Paris like the other artists, but also spent time with the DuBois' learning more about wines. 
    
At the end of the two years, she was ready to come back to her family. When she returned, she agreed to take over managing the vineyard. Jean Pierre wanted to be able to spend more time with his parents before they were any older. 

When it was necessary Tom would send out an urgent post to his advice clients. One was when he sent the post on tech stocks. He told his investors that tech stocks had been the darling stock for several years. When some made good money on them, everyone jumped on board. Now the prices of the stock had risen well above the reasonable value of the stock. There was going to be a correction, probably in the next quarter, but definitely within the next year. Once the correction starts, there will be a panic sale of tech stocks across the board and a crash in the prices, and tech will be a four letter word. I am quietly divesting all tech stocks before the prices fall. Once the prices fall there will be plenty of bargains to be had. Just as he predicted, a couple of months later the correction started and the prices went into a free fall, everyone wanted to sell and nobody wanted to buy. Tech was no longer a darling.  

Tom thought back on the talk that he had with Bob the night Tommy was born. At the time his grandchildren were born, he gave each new parent the advice that he had received from Bob all those years ago. Don't worry about being the perfect parent, just show your children all the love you can. That is what they will remember. It had worked for him, it would work for them also.
    
Now that Tom had more time on his hands than he knew what to do with, he sat down and wrote the book ""Thomas Wolfe on Wall Street"". It was more than just investment advice, it was also his memoirs. It layered investment strategies with life lessons. The struggles he faced and overcame. What motivated him to do so in the face of adversity. And in the end how love triumphs.
 
He had lived a charmed life for some reason. He had parents that loved him and were willing to sacrifice for him. Mr. Sullivan had given a lot of the basics that he was still using. And he had found both passions in his life at an early age, Betsy who was still at his side and was to him more beautiful than ever, and investing, which had given him and his family a nice life. And he had three wonderful children that had given him amazing grandchildren. How could life have been any better?

I love food whether it’s cooked at home or found at the local mom-and-pop restaurant while exploring around town. I value the memories, conversations, and connection that a good dinner table can create, no matter where it is. 



Travel is intentional. At least once a month, and sometimes spontaneous. Museums, coffee shops, great meals, and hidden bars are the move. I also want someone willing to hop on a plane after work on a Friday, without a plan, and see where we end up.



Childfree. Flirty banter comes naturally and chemistry matters. I value someone invested in their emotional intelligence, self-care, and growth. The healthiest relationships have ***his, hers, and ours*** — independence, connection, and something shared.



Long-term, I want someone to build a toward a DINK life with me. Freedom, flexibility, good food, smart choices, and the ability to say yes to adventures without overthinking the bill.

Regardless I am so depressed and can't stop crying today. 

Our car broke down, we live outside of town and don't have anyone nearby that could help us out. My husband works in town and is currently on a two hour walk into town to get to work. He won't be back until around midnight or so because his shift is very long hours plus the two hour walk back home. We ran out of food yesterday (aside from like coffee and a jar of peanut butter, we were eating peanut butter and baking chocolate chips in the middle of the night out of desperation, we even ran out of ramen 

My husband was home yesterday trying to figure out if he could get the car fixed, but it ended up being a waste. Today I'm at home with my baby and our dogs. The house doesn't have central heating so we are cold (it was 20° felt like 15° when we woke up and it's only climbed to 28° since then) and the water lines froze so we are stuck here without food, nearly out of drinking water, cold, alone, shitty wifi, and no one to come visit to keep baby and I company. Can't order food delivery cause the small amount of money we have needs to go towards fixing the car, as we don't have enough to cover the cost of repairs yet.

Even with my husband persisting and going to work anyway it won't be enough to get the car repaired and cover all our bills and groceries. It's miserable and I feel helpless. My irritability is making me less paitent with my baby and I feel like a terrible mother. 

On top of all that I found out that my mom's dog (my childhood dog) passed away yesterday at the ripe old age of 13. I just feel like dropping out of existence would be better than this.

1qfk43o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RedParrot_Tom/comments/1qfk43o/hi_reddit_i_built_an_ai_tutor_to_help_you/,Hi Reddit! 👋 I built an AI tutor to help you practice SPEAKING languages without the anxiety. Meet RedParrot.ai,"Hey everyone,

I’m the founder of **RedParrot.ai**.

Like many of you here, I spent years using popular apps (like the green owl 🦉), accumulating streaks and learning vocabulary. But when it came time to actually **speak** to a real person, I froze. I had the knowledge, but I lacked the confidence and the ""muscle memory"" of conversation.

I realized that to learn to speak, you actually have to... speak. Not just tap screens.

That's why I built **RedParrot.ai**. It’s an AI conversation partner designed to bridge the gap between knowing grammar and being fluent.

**🦜 What makes it different?**

* **Zero Anxiety:** You talk to an AI, so there is no fear of making mistakes or being judged. It’s the safest place to fail and learn.
* **Real-Life Scenarios:** Instead of random sentences, you roleplay specific situations: *Ordering coffee in Paris, A job interview in London, checking into a hotel in Berlin, etc.*
* **Instant Feedback:** After every turn, the AI (optionally) corrects your grammar, pronunciation, and suggests better vocabulary. It’s like having a tutor sitting next to you 24/7.
* **Dynamic Conversations:** No scripted dialogues. The conversation changes based on what YOU say.

**🚀 Who is this for?**

* **Introverts & Anxious Learners:** If `italki` or real tutors stress you out right now.
* **Busy Professionals:** If you need to practice Business English at 11 PM.
* **Travelers:** If you need to survive a trip abroad next week.

**🎁 For the Reddit Community**

I’d love for you to try it out and roast my product. Feedback from this community is brutal but incredibly valuable.

1qfk3u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/buybestguide/comments/1qfk3u3/best_budget_laptop_for_student_in_2026_finally/,Best budget laptop for student in 2026? Finally narrowed it down to 5 options after weeks of research - need help deciding,"Okay so I've been obsessively researching laptops for the past three weeks and I think I've finally narrowed down my options but I still can't pull the trigger. Every time I'm about to buy one I second guess myself and go back to reading more reviews. My brain is fried from comparison charts and spec sheets.

I know ""budget"" means different things to different people so let me clarify - I've saved up around $700-$900 from my summer internship at a marketing firm and my part-time campus job. I could maybe stretch to $1000 if something is really worth it, but I'd prefer to stay under $900 if possible so I have money left for textbooks and other stuff.

**My daily situation:**

I'm on campus basically all day Monday through Thursday. I have gaps between classes where I camp out in the library or student center to do homework. The outlets are always taken so battery life is absolutely critical for me. I need something that can survive at least 8+ hours of actual use, not the ""up to 18 hours"" marketing nonsense that actually means 5 hours in real life.

I carry my laptop everywhere in my backpack so weight matters. My current brick is like 5 pounds and my shoulder literally hurts by the end of the day. I'd love something under 4 pounds if possible but not a dealbreaker if it's slightly heavier.

**What I actually use my laptop for:**

* Writing papers. So many papers. Business case studies, research papers for my analytics courses, reports for group projects. I'm talking 15-20 page papers regularly. Microsoft Word and Google Docs are basically my home.
* Spreadsheets and data analysis. This is HUGE for my data analytics minor. I use Excel constantly - pivot tables, VLOOKUP, large datasets with thousands of rows. I've also started learning Python and R for my upper-level analytics courses and will be using them more next year.
* Presentations. PowerPoint and Google Slides for group projects and class presentations. My business program is very presentation-heavy.
* Web browsing. Research for papers means tons of tabs open at once. I'm not exaggerating when I say I sometimes have 40+ tabs open across multiple windows. My current laptop cries when I do this.
* Zoom and Teams. Still have some hybrid classes and group meetings happen virtually.
* Streaming. Netflix, YouTube, Spotify while I study. Background noise helps me focus.
* Light photo and video editing. Nothing professional but I sometimes need to edit graphics for marketing class presentations or club activities. Canva, basic Photoshop, maybe Premiere for simple video projects for my marketing elective.
* Note-taking in class. I type all my notes. My handwriting is terrible and I can type way faster.
* Email. So much email between professors, group projects, internship applications. Currently applying for summer 2026 internships in business analytics so my inbox is insane.
* Statistical software. SPSS and Stata for my research methods and quantitative analysis classes. These programs can be resource-heavy especially with larger datasets.

**What I don't really need:**

* Gaming capabilities. I have a desktop at home for that.
* Super high-end graphics. Not doing any serious video production or 3D rendering.
* Crazy thin bezels or aesthetic design. Function over form for me.
* Tons of ports. Would be nice but I have a USB-C hub already.
* Biometric login. Fingerprint reader would be cool but not essential.

**What actually matters to me :**

1. **Battery life** \- This is number one by far. I need all-day battery that actually lasts all day.
2. **Performance for multitasking** \- Between Excel, SPSS, browser tabs, and Word documents all running simultaneously, I need something that won't choke on my workflow.
3. **Reliability** \- Need this to last through graduation (2+ years) and hopefully into my first job after college.
4. **Keyboard quality** \- I type thousands of words weekly between papers and notes. A bad keyboard would make my life miserable.
5. **Display quality** \- I stare at this thing 8+ hours daily working on spreadsheets and papers. Don't want eye strain from a terrible screen.
6. **Weight/portability** \- Carrying it around all day so lighter is better.
7. **Build quality** \- Don't want something that feels like it'll fall apart in a year.

**THE 5 LAPTOPS I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO:**

After reading probably hundreds of reviews, threads, and YouTube videos, these are the five that keep standing out. I'd really appreciate input from anyone who actually owns or has used any of these.

**1.** [**Apple MacBook Air M4 (2025)** ](https://www.expertguiders.com/best-student-laptops-2026-budget-performance-battery-life/#strong-1-apple-mac-book-air-m-4-2025-best-overall-for-students-strong)**- The ""splurge"" option**

Okay I know what you're thinking - ""MacBook isn't budget!"" - but hear me out. The base model M4 Air is around $999 which is at the top of my range but potentially doable if I pick up a few extra shifts at my campus job. And literally everyone keeps telling me that when you factor in how long MacBooks last, it's actually good value long-term.

**What attracts me to it:**

The battery life on these M-series MacBooks is apparently insane. I've seen people say they genuinely get 15-18 hours on a single charge which sounds almost too good to be true. The M4 chip is supposed to be incredibly efficient and powerful for everyday tasks. The build quality is obviously excellent - these things last forever from what I've heard. The trackpad is legendary. The display is gorgeous. And it's super lightweight at like 2.7 pounds which would be amazing for my back.

**My concerns:**

The price is right at my max budget with zero wiggle room. Also I've been a Windows user my entire life so there's a learning curve. Here's my biggest worry though - will Microsoft Excel work properly on Mac? Like I said, my data analytics minor means I live in Excel and I've heard the Mac version is slightly different and missing some features. Same concern for SPSS and Stata - are they fully compatible with Mac? I can't afford compatibility issues when I'm in the middle of a big analytics project. And I've heard the base model only has 8GB RAM which some people say isn't enough in 2025/2026. But others say macOS handles memory way better than Windows so 8GB on Mac equals like 16GB on Windows? I don't really understand that but I've seen it mentioned a lot.

**Questions for MacBook Air M4 owners:**

* Is 8GB RAM actually enough for heavy multitasking with lots of tabs, Excel, and statistical software running?
* How's the experience using Microsoft Excel on Mac? Any missing features compared to Windows Excel?
* Do SPSS and Stata run properly on M4 Macs? Any compatibility issues?
* How's Python and R development on Mac? Better or worse than Windows?
* Does it handle Excel with large datasets okay? I work with files that have 10,000+ rows sometimes.
* Is the learning curve coming from Windows actually that bad?
* Do you think it's worth the premium price for a business/analytics student?

**2.** [**HP 15.6"" FHD Touchscreen i7 Laptop**](https://www.expertguiders.com/best-student-laptops-2026-budget-performance-battery-life/#strong-2-hp-15-6-fhd-touchscreen-i-7-laptop-best-value-pick-strong) **- The ""value king"" option**

This one caught my attention because the specs are really impressive for the price. From what I've seen it's usually around $600-$700 which would leave me money for accessories or maybe some new business clothes for internship interviews. It has an Intel i7 processor which should be plenty powerful for my analytics work, 15.6"" FHD touchscreen display, and decent RAM and storage options.

**What attracts me to it:**

The price-to-performance ratio seems unbeatable honestly. Getting an i7 processor at this price point is pretty great for someone who needs to run statistical software and work with large spreadsheets. The touchscreen could be useful for scrolling through long Excel files and presentations even though I said I don't need it - might be nice to have. Full HD display should be good enough for everyday use. HP is a brand I trust - my parents have had HP laptops for years without issues.

**My concerns:**

I've read that some HP budget laptops have mediocre battery life which is my biggest priority. Spending all day on campus between my business lectures and analytics labs, I need something reliable. Also worried about build quality at this price point - will it feel cheap and plasticky? Some reviews mention the fan can get loud under load which could be embarrassing during quiet study sessions in the library. And I'm not sure about the long-term durability compared to higher-end options.

**Questions for HP i7 laptop owners:**

* What's the realistic battery life? Can you get through a full school day of classes and studying?
* How does it handle resource-heavy programs like Excel with big datasets or SPSS?
* How's the build quality? Does it feel sturdy or flimsy?
* Does the touchscreen actually add value or is it a gimmick?
* Has it slowed down over time?
* Fan noise - is it annoyingly loud during normal use or when running heavier programs?
* How's the keyboard for long typing sessions?
* Any overheating issues during extended use?

**3.** [**Lenovo V-Series V15 Business Laptop**](https://www.expertguiders.com/best-student-laptops-2026-budget-performance-battery-life/#strong-3-lenovo-v-series-v-15-business-laptop-best-for-heavy-multitasking-strong) **- The ""productivity beast"" option**

This one is marketed as a business laptop which I've heard means better build quality and reliability than consumer models. The V15 supposedly handles multitasking really well which is super important for me since I always have Excel, Word, a browser with 30 tabs, and sometimes SPSS all running at once during my analytics assignments.

**What attracts me to it:**

Lenovo has an amazing reputation for keyboards - basically everyone says ThinkPads and their business lines have the best keyboards for typing. If the V15 inherits any of that DNA, that would be huge for me given how much I type for my business papers and case studies. Business-class laptops are usually built to last longer because they're designed for corporate environments where reliability matters. That's exactly what I need - something that can survive daily use through graduation and into my first corporate job. The specs seem solid for heavy multitasking with good RAM and processing power.

**My concerns:**

The design is definitely more ""boring business"" than sleek and modern but honestly I don't care that much - it might even look more professional for internship interviews when I have to present something. More concerned about the display quality - business laptops sometimes cheap out on screens since they're not marketed to consumers who care about that stuff. When I'm staring at spreadsheets for hours, display quality matters. Battery life reviews seem mixed from what I've found. Also not sure if the V-series is actually as good as ThinkPads or if it's a step down.

**Questions for Lenovo V15 owners:**

* How's the keyboard compared to other laptops? Is it actually ThinkPad-level good? Important for all the papers I write.
* Is the display quality decent or noticeably bad? Worried about eye strain during long Excel sessions.
* Battery life - can you get through a long day of classes and study sessions?
* How's performance with lots of programs and tabs open at once? Excel + SPSS + browser + Word simultaneously?
* Build quality - does it feel durable and professional enough for business settings?
* Any complaints about the trackpad?
* How does it compare to ThinkPads if you've used both?

**4.** [**Dell 16 Laptop DC16256** ](https://www.expertguiders.com/best-student-laptops-2026-budget-performance-battery-life/#strong-4-dell-16-laptop-dc-16256-best-large-display-strong)**- The ""big screen"" option**

I wasn't originally considering larger laptops because of portability concerns, but then I started thinking about how much time I spend staring at spreadsheets and how nice it would be to have more real estate for Excel and having multiple windows side by side. The Dell 16 has a 16-inch display which is significantly bigger than the typical 15.6"" or 14"" options.

**What attracts me to it:**

That 16-inch display is really tempting for productivity. Being able to have Excel on one side and my research on the other without squinting sounds amazing for my analytics homework. More screen space for large spreadsheets would be huge - I hate having to constantly scroll horizontally when working with datasets that have lots of columns. Dell has a good reputation for build quality and reliability in business environments. Their customer support is supposedly decent too which matters for a big purchase.

**My concerns:**

The bigger screen means bigger laptop means heavier laptop. Not sure how much it weighs but I'm worried about carrying it around campus all day between my business classes in the management building and my analytics labs in the STEM building. Battery life might also take a hit from powering a larger display? And larger laptops are usually more expensive so not sure where this falls in my budget. Also wondering if 16 inches is awkward to use in cramped lecture hall desks - some of my business lecture halls have those tiny fold-out desks.

**Questions for Dell 16 owners:**

* How heavy is it actually? Is it painful to carry around all day between classes?
* Does the bigger screen drain the battery faster? Can you still get through a full school day?
* Is 16 inches awkward to use on small lecture hall desks or in coffee shops?
* How's the build quality? Does it feel premium and professional?
* Is the extra screen real estate actually worth the tradeoffs in portability? Especially for spreadsheet work?
* Keyboard and trackpad quality?
* Would you recommend this size for a student who walks around campus a lot?

**5.** [**HP 15.6"" FHD Touchscreen Business Laptop (i7-1255U)**](https://www.expertguiders.com/best-student-laptops-2026-budget-performance-battery-life/#strong-5-hp-15-6-fhd-touchscreen-business-laptop-i-7-1255-u-best-touchscreen-business-option-strong) **- The ""business meets student"" option**

This is another HP but specifically the business-oriented version with the Intel i7-1255U processor. It's positioned as a more professional option compared to the consumer HP laptops which hopefully means better build quality and more focus on reliability over flashy features. As someone going into the business world after graduation, having a professional-grade machine seems smart.

**What attracts me to it:**

The i7-1255U is a solid processor that should handle everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat - Excel, SPSS, Python, multiple browser tabs, all at once. Business laptop designation usually means better durability and longer lifespan which is important since I want this to last through graduation and into my first analyst job. The touchscreen is there if I want it but the focus seems to be on productivity features. HP business laptops supposedly have better keyboards than their consumer lines which would be great for all my paper writing. Should come with Windows Pro which has some extra features that might be useful for corporate environments down the line.

**My concerns:**

Not entirely sure how this differs from the other HP option I mentioned earlier besides being ""business"" branded. Is it actually better built or just marketing? Also business laptops sometimes sacrifice aesthetics and display quality for durability which could be annoying when I'm working on spreadsheets for hours. Price point I'm not 100% sure on either.

**Questions for HP Business laptop owners:**

* Is there an actual noticeable difference between HP business and consumer laptops?
* Build quality comparison - does it feel more premium and professional?
* How's the display quality? Any complaints about viewing angles or brightness during long work sessions?
* Battery life for all-day use on campus?
* Is Windows Pro actually useful for students or overkill? Will it matter when I start working?
* The i7-1255U specifically - how does it handle heavy workloads like statistical software?
* Any overheating or thermal issues during extended use?

**GENERAL QUESTIONS FOR EVERYONE:**

1. Out of these 5 options, which would you personally choose for a business/analytics student who prioritizes battery life and multitasking?
2. Is the MacBook Air M4 actually worth the premium over the Windows options for someone who relies heavily on Excel and statistical software?
3. For heavy multitaskers (lots of tabs + Excel + SPSS/Stata), is 8GB RAM enough in 2026 or should I specifically look for 16GB?
4. How important is the generation of Intel processor? The i7-1255U vs newer generations?
5. Touchscreen - actually useful for scrolling through spreadsheets and documents or just drains battery faster?
6. 15.6"" vs 16"" display - is the extra size worth the portability tradeoff for someone who works with large datasets?
7. Business vs consumer laptops - is there actually a meaningful difference in durability and professional feel?
8. Any of these known to have reliability issues or things that break commonly?
9. Best place to buy - directly from manufacturer, Best Buy, Amazon, Costco? Does warranty matter? Any student discounts I should know about?
10. Any other laptops in this price range I should consider that I completely missed? Specifically good for business/analytics students?

**What I've already learned from researching:**

* Don't get less than 8GB RAM for analytics work (some say 16GB minimum in 2026)
* SSD is non-negotiable, never HDD - especially for running statistical software
* Intel 12th gen and newer is a big improvement over older generations
* Screen brightness matters - 250 nits is meh, 300+ is better for working outdoors or near windows
* IPS panels have better viewing angles than TN - important for group work and presentations
* Always check actual user battery life not manufacturer claims
* Student discounts exist for some brands (Apple, Dell, Lenovo) - need to look into these
* Buying refurbished can be good value if from a reputable source
* Extended warranties are usually not worth it except maybe for Apple
* Look for at least 256GB storage, 512GB preferred - especially if running Python and statistical software

I know this post is insanely long but I've been going back and forth on this decision for weeks and I just want to make the right choice. This is a significant purchase for me and I want something that will last through graduation and hopefully into my first analyst or business job.

If anyone has personal experience with any of these five laptops - especially other business or analytics students - I would be incredibly grateful for your honest opinions. Good, bad, things you love, things you hate - I want to hear it all.

Also totally open to suggestions I haven't considered if you think there's a better option I'm missing in this price range for someone with my needs.

April arrives like it’s been dared.

The first genuinely warm day of the year hits the city and everyone behaves like they’ve been released from a tasteful prison. Coats vanish. Skin appears. Sunglasses come out like moral disclaimers. People start smiling at strangers, which is either hope or a symptom.

I’m walking to work in a jacket I definitely don’t need, because I don’t trust the weather and I trust myself even less. The air is soft and bright and faintly smells like blooming trees and bus exhaust—springtime, but make it municipal.

On the corner by the station, a man in shorts drinks an iced coffee at 8:14 a.m. like he’s in a perfume ad called Denial. A woman eats strawberries straight from the punnet with the solemn focus of someone taking communion. A cyclist shoots past, shirt open, chest glinting. I look away like I’m polite. I am not polite.

My phone buzzes.

LIV: it’s HOT
LIV: like… actual hot
LIV: u still alive or have u evaporated

I type back with my thumbs moving faster than my brain.

ME: i’m alive. i’m normal. i’m very emotionally hydrated

The lie is so immediate I don’t even taste it.

A gust of wind swings a poster flap against a wall: WELLNESS. REBIRTH. YOU 2.0. A woman in yoga pants is laughing on it, perfect teeth, perfect peace. Underneath in smaller type: Intro Offer. Limited Spaces.

Everything is a subscription now. Healing. Enlightenment. Oat milk. The hope that a new week will fix you. Like if you log in enough times, the system awards you a better personality.

I step into the tube station with the rest of the morning flock and the doors swallow us. The escalator drops into the underground like a slow prayer. The fluorescent lighting turns everyone into the same tired color, a shared shade of I want to go home even though I’ve just left it.

The platform is already crowded. People stand in neat rows pretending they aren’t a body mass. Everyone is holding something: a coffee, a tote bag, a grudge. I’m holding my phone like it’s a talisman and a threat.

A train announcement crackles overhead, half-drowned in static:

“Mind… the gap… between… you…”



The words fall apart and in the gap my brain fills in what it always fills in.

Between you and what you wanted. Between you and what you said you wanted. Between you and the person who knew your middle name like a spell.

I do not say his name out loud. It tastes like pennies.

My phone buzzes again.

LIV: also… saw ur ex last night

There it is. The easy violence of modern life: a sentence that changes the weather inside your ribs.

I stop walking because my body thinks it has to freeze to survive. A man shoulder-checks me and mutters something that sounds like “move” but could also be “mood.”

I type.

ME: which ex

This is, technically, a joke. I have one ex that matters. The others are footnotes, unfinished songs, people I kissed because the lighting was flattering and I mistook adrenaline for compatibility.

There’s a pause long enough for my pulse to start doing that dramatic thing where it tries to become a drumline.

LIV: Ezra. he looked… refreshed 😐

Refreshed.

Like he’s a can of something sparkling. Like he’s had a facial and a new perspective. Like he’s been watered.

I swallow, and it’s embarrassing how much of my throat gets involved. I look at the faces around me—blank, bored, bright-eyed, dead-eyed—and I wonder if any of them are also holding a person inside their chest like a stone.

I type.

ME: refreshed how

LIV: like he’s been drinking water
LIV: like he’s been journaling
LIV: like he has a therapist he actually listens to
LIV: like he’s about to commit emotional arson with good posture

I snort. A woman beside me looks up with the silent contempt of someone who thinks joy should be private.

I decide, in the very specific way you decide things when you are not doing well, that this is funny. It is funny. It is hilarious. My ex has possibly achieved enlightenment and I’m still dehydrated and haunted, walking around with chapstick and a personality disorder.

The train comes. Doors open. People flood in as if the carriage is salvation and not a metal box that smells like impatience. I squeeze into a corner, pinned between a man with headphones leaking the ghost of a bassline and a woman whose perfume could strip paint.

I stare at the tube map above the doors. It’s all colored lines intersecting, all paths and transfers. It looks like fate made by a graphic designer.

My phone buzzes again. A new message.

UNKNOWN NUMBER: u ok?

My stomach drops so fast it feels like a magic trick.

Unknown number. Two words. Lowercase. No punctuation. A tiny blunt instrument.

There’s only one person in my life who texts like that. There’s only one person who can make my body react like a building hearing its own demolition.

I don’t respond. I don’t even open it properly. I let the preview sit there on my lock screen like a dare.

The train lurches forward and my reflection in the window wobbles—face split by the glass, eyes doubled, mouth slightly open like I’m about to say something honest and then decide not to.

There’s a part of me that wants to reply immediately, because my body is a museum that still lets him in for free. There’s another part of me that wants to throw my phone into the river and join a silent convent.

I text Liv instead.

ME: he texted “u ok?”
ME: i am going to become a feral creature

She responds instantly.

LIV: DO NOT REPLY
LIV: BLOCK HIM
LIV: BURN YOUR PHONE
LIV: (or… screenshot it and send it to me so i can hate him with detail)

I screenshot. Of course I do. I send it. Of course I do.

The carriage smells like warm fabric and ambition. A man is reading a book titled HOW TO BE HERE NOW and underlining everything like the words are a ladder out. Someone is watching a video on full volume. It’s a recipe. A woman in the video is whispering, “Now we add a little water,” and I feel personally attacked.

Outside the window is only dark. We pass through black tunnels like thoughts I’m not allowed to have at 8:30 a.m.

When I surface at my stop, the air aboveground is different: brighter, louder, full of people walking like they have somewhere important to be. The city has that morning glitter—sunlight catching on windows, on watches, on a thousand little acts of pretending.

I work in an office where the carpets are grey and the plants are fake, which is a metaphor so obvious it hurts. My job is fine. My coworkers are fine. My brain is not fine, but I keep it on silent most of the time.

At my desk, I open my laptop, and the screen fills with emails and deadlines and the illusion that any of this matters more than the fact that Ezra has returned to my orbit like a cursed moon.

I don’t open the unknown number text. I don’t reply. I try to work.

At 10:17 a.m., I fail and Google “how to block someone without them knowing” like I’m asking for directions to a secret exit.

At 11:03 a.m., my phone buzzes again.

UNKNOWN NUMBER: saw u on the tube. u looked… stressed lol

Heat crawls up my neck. I stare at the message until the letters look like insects.

He saw me. He saw me and he didn’t speak to me, which is worse than speaking to me. He saw me and then he texted me like a ghost making fun of the living.

Also: lol.

I can’t decide which part is more insulting—that he thinks my stress is funny, or that he thinks he’s allowed to observe me like I’m weather.

I type a response, because my thumbs are traitors.

ME (draft): don’t text me
ME (draft): who is this
ME (draft): hope your plants leave you
ME (draft): please stop

I delete all of them.

I put my phone face-down like it’s doing something disgusting and I don’t want to watch.

When the afternoon break comes, I go outside and stand in the little plaza behind the building. People sit on benches eating salads they clearly hate because they’re being watched by their own self-image. Someone laughs too loudly, like they’re trying to prove something. The sun is bright enough to make you believe in happiness if you squint.

My phone buzzes. This time it’s Liv calling.

I answer.

“Tell me everything,” she says immediately, like she’s about to cross-examine me in court.

“He texted me.”

“I know,” she says. “I got the screenshot and my spirit left my body. Are you okay?”

“No,” I say, because the sun makes me honest for five seconds. “I’m fine.”

“That’s not honesty, that’s branding.”

I exhale. “He said he saw me on the tube.”

Liv makes a noise that’s half-laugh, half-disgust. “I hate him in a very feminist way.”

“I hate him in a very pathetic way.”

“Same thing,” she says. “Okay. Here’s what we’re going to do.”

There are two kinds of friends in the world: the ones who tell you to calm down, and the ones who make you a plan sharp enough to cut.

Liv is the second kind.

“We are going out,” she says.

“No.”

“Yes.”

“I have work.”

“You have trauma,” she corrects. “Work will still be there tomorrow. Trauma will still be there tomorrow too, but at least you’ll be wearing something cute.”

I start to laugh and it comes out broken.

“What’s the plan?” I ask, because my body is already leaning toward the cliff.

“A healing night out,” Liv says, and I can hear her smiling like she’s about to commit a minor crime. “Rules. Structure. Dignity.”

“I don’t have dignity,” I say.

“We’ll rent it,” she says. “We’ll do a ritual.”

“A ritual,” I repeat, like I’m a Victorian child about to be sacrificed in a novel.

“Listen,” Liv says. “This city turns everyone into a dry little husk unless you do something. We’re going to take you somewhere loud. We’re going to remind your body you exist. We’re going to make you laugh until the spell breaks.”

“What spell?”

“The one where Ezra gets to be the main character of your life,” she says. “The one where you mistake longing for truth.”

I close my eyes. Somewhere deep in my chest, something shifts like a door trying to open.

“You’re not allowed to text him,” Liv continues. “You’re not allowed to go looking for him. You’re not allowed to be sad in a bathroom unless it’s funny.”

“Sad in a bathroom is always funny,” I say, and she snorts.

“And,” she adds, voice lowering like she’s about to tell me a secret that will change the weather, “we are not doing that thing where you turn desire into self-punishment.”

“That is my primary hobby,” I say.

“Not tonight,” she says. “Tonight you are a person, not an audition.”

I swallow again. My throat is full of unsaid things. Outside, the trees are flowering like they have no idea what it costs.

“Okay,” I say finally, because sometimes your life changes on a single word, and sometimes it changes on the decision to leave the house with lip gloss on.

“Good,” Liv says. “Meet me after work. Wear something that says: I may be unstable, but I am curated.”

I laugh, and it actually feels like water.

When the call ends, I stare at my phone.

The unknown number sits there like an itch.

I open the messages, thumb hovering over the thread.

Ezra’s two texts glare up at me.

u ok?

saw u on the tube. u looked… stressed lol

I imagine replying something cold and perfect. I imagine being unbothered. I imagine saying something that makes him feel small. I imagine saying something that makes him miss me.

All of these are fantasies. None of them are freedom.

I lock my phone and shove it into my bag like I’m putting a snake away.

I go back inside. I sit at my desk. I try to focus on emails. I fail.

At 4:56 p.m., my computer clock reads 16:56 and my brain decides this is a sign, because my brain is always looking for signs when it refuses to accept reality.

In my notes app, without thinking, I type:

April is cruel because everyone’s hot again and you remember you have a body and your body remembers everything.



I stare at the sentence. It stares back.

In the glass wall of the meeting room opposite my desk, I catch my reflection again: split by panels, multiplied. I look like a person made of fragments. Like something that broke and kept walking.

Outside, the day is still bright. The city looks freshly washed even though it hasn’t rained in weeks. People move through the streets like they know exactly where they’re going. I used to think that meant they were safe.

Now I think it just means they’re practiced.

My phone buzzes one last time before I leave.

It’s Liv.

LIV: i’m outside ur building at 6
LIV: bring ur thirst
LIV: (also bring water. actual water.)

I tuck my phone away. I stand up. I grab my bag like it’s a lifeline.

As I walk out into the sunlight, the air feels warm enough to forgive me for being alive. The city hums. The crowd moves. Somewhere, a river waits with its dark, patient mouth.

And somewhere in this unreal city, my ex is out there too—refreshed, rebranded, drinking water like he invented it—texting me from an unknown number like the past can just slip into my pocket and call it intimacy.

I take a breath.

The warm week has begun.

At the corner by the station, a stranger says into their phone, loud enough for everyone to hear:

“I’m not heartbroken. I’m tired.”

1qfjzgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitPornForever/comments/1qfjzgf/my_full_story/,My full story,"Hello, i just wanna start by saying that i am not very fluent in english so if find this harder to read i am sorry.

Hi, lets talk about porn addiction. Yes, i am addicted too, i am a 21 yo guy, student, i work, i have friends and a normal life but in my free time i have urges as any human. Lets discuss them.

●Firstly i wanna say that my porn addiction isn't interrupting my social life, i dont skip hanging out with friends or school for porn, i can work perfectly fine without it, maybe i am this way because i dont smoke or drink coffee either and alcohol only when a few times a year. 

●As i said my porn addiction isn't interrupting my social life but i find that porn is a big part in my personal and private life, when i am alone i find it hard to fight the urge to watch porn, at this point its a routine, i said earlier i can function without it too because in the past i was porn free for a period and i was perfectly fine even if i watched or not porn. At the start of the year i was on vacation with my friends and i couldnt watch porn and i didn't felt myself more depressed or sad, i was feeling more alive and i loved it but when i got home and get back to my routine i relapsed. My usual day starts with a quick one because its in my routine, i can go with my life without it but i find it more comfortable to do it, it feels natural and i absolutely hate it but i can't fight it.

I tried when i feel the urge to do something else, like doing pushups until exhaustion but when i lay in bed the urge comes back. \[OFF TOPIC u can skip this part if u want. I wanna start going to the gym and if anyone here its kindly enough to give me some exercising tips i will be grateful\]

●Now lets talk about the causes of the urges. The first one? Obviously social media, isnt a secret that social media is a soft porn horror movie and thats the first trigger. 2nd? I find twitter/reddit same as bad as social media, u can find extremely niche content. 

●Now if i said niche content lets talk about it.

This is a big and complicated chapter for me, why? let me tell u.

I started pretty much here, on reddit, findind X amount of porn subreddits, i tried them ALL (curious teenager), i was from the bullshit ""bully and victim"" scenario where i was pretending to f boys girlfriends all the way to being the girl getting f by bullies. I tried all scenarios and parts of this reddit until i decided that i am better than that and i quit, i deleted my accounts, reddit and i quit doing that bullshit, was the best decision, \[if u are in my situation just delete reddit, its hard, but if i did it u can too dude\]. I am sober from reddit already for a few years, i dont use reddit for porn.

Now my new addiction is this site called spicychat where u talk to an AI and u do scenarios and i can tell u guys, it fucks u up badly, i am addicted, i tried deleting my account but i cant fight it. Its worst than reddit, 10 times. Atleast on reddit u talk with real persons and u know when u cross some limits, there u dont know, its all a AI powered chat used to brainwash u into some bad and nasty conversation and alter ur view over world. Stop using it if u do. I try and its extremely hard.

Now lets talk about my views on porn and the types of content.

I find myself in the category of the people that enjoy BDSM, nothing wrong here, but what i find hard to fight are the memes and content around this type of kink on reddit and X and spicychat, there the woman is just a toy even if she doesn't want it and when i feel the urge to masturbate i enjoy those type of videos and memes but right after i am done i realize that those vids and memes are sick asf and they disgust me, i dont stand for violence. BDSM isnt violence if u do it the right way. The 2nd most disturbing thing for me is the BNWO memes and content, that includes cuckolding and more, if u know u know. I dont stand for that in my social life, i dont see the woman inferior to men and i hate knowing that i watch that type of content when i am urges and i would love it to break free. In my social life i have more girl friends than boys and one girl thats like my sister, we know eachother for 12 years at this point and i can never treat her or any other woman like an object, its disgusting, and i ""hate"" myself that i find it attractive in porn.

I never been a fan of that type of content, the BNWO and female inferiority content but lately i find it more hot and i think this is because my dopamine system is doomed now more than even from that AI site.

●The end. I wanna say that i tried writing this post for a week because i was lying to myself i will write it after i am done with my urges and i never got to write it. Now i said enough is enough and atleast write it. I know all the power to quit is at me and if i really wanna quit i just quit but i think the addiction is more powerful then me, as i said i never fought an addiction because i dont have any beside porn.

Now for the end if anyone wanna talk about anything, got any questions or general curiosity about me or my addiction i am open to talk about it in comments or private. I try atleast to talk about my addiction maybe it will help me beat it.

Thank u if u read all i wrote. Have a nice day and stay strong!!",3,1768672630.0,QuitPornForever,1,1.0,False
1qfjz39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1qfjz39/living_through_reduction_guide_1_food/,Living through reduction guide 1: Food,"Hey guys. A while back i wrote this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1ptj86k/living\_through\_reduction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1ptj86k/living_through_reduction/) . Earlier today i made a poll asking if you wanted me to post more about it and the mods removed it saying I should just post it. I am gonna basically make a series of posts about how to reduce demand in different aspects of life. I'm starting with food because it's the easiest and most can immediately do it. I still haven't started but I am moving soon and I will start it when i do, as a fresh start.

Ok so when it comes to food, you can reduce how much money you spend and how much effort you put in to cook and clean. I can't tell you in terms of money what you'd be spending because costs are different everywhere. Time spent on cooking would be 0 if you do it like me and we'd only get one plastic container dirty and a set of knife, fork and spoon.

The first step is to identify your needs. I for example don't need to worry about iron because my body absorbs it too well(i have excess) and I do better when there's more carb than fat in my diet so the goal is to make sure I have one good source of protein, one good source of carbs and at least one vegetable. I also prefer eating 2 meals a day.

Before going further let's cover some basics. My staples include instant coffee, a sweetener, salt, a jar of mayo(preferably spicy) because it's a good way to add calories and fats if a dish needs that, vinegar and garlic powder. As far as appliances go, I only really need a microwave. 

Now let's identify some cheap sources of protein that you don't need to cook: canned chickpeas, canned beans, tofu, some ham, cottage cheese or similar products, greek yoghurt, canned fish. Now if you have other suggestions I am all ears. 

Then cheap sources of carbs: canned corn, rice cakes, pretzels, chips, bread rolls, oats

Now when it comes to veggies you don't really need to pay anything. That's the biggest tip. I think one of the best hobbies for zoids is foraging. And you don't need to be an expert just be able to identify a few plants. You can forage greens such as Sorrel, Horseradish leaves, Mustard leaves, Chicory leaves, Lamb quarter, Horseweed, Clover, Alfalfa, Purslane. You can forage roots(with a small shovel) such as burdock root, chicory root, horseradish and salsify root. You can forage fruits - wild strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, wild plums and apples. You can forage aromatics - mint, wild garlic, thyme, dill. And you can forage nuts - acorns, hazelnuts, chestnuts(be careful there are inedible ones, you need to compare the leaves) but i wouldn't do this as you then need to crush them(maybe i'd only do chestnuts). Ofc this all depends on where you live.

So here's an example meal - half a can of chickpeas, half a can of corn, cropped sorrel leaves, mint, garlic powder, a couple of teaspons of mayo, a teaspoon of vinegar, salt and there you go.

Other than buying individual ingredients, you can get good deals on frozen meals too. ",2,1768672609.0,Schizoid,1,1.0,False

This morning I was drinking coffee, enjoying life in the green zone, and then I spotted something like a dull neural cloud signature in my logs, completely messing up my deployed agents.

I tracked this signature as it messed with my VPS and agents and figured out it was just a simple worm malware controlled by a rogue neural cloud. You cannot imagine how pissed off I was. All my work from yesterday was completely gone.

I immediately contacted their tech support and got nothing. Apparently some old hag with cat ears is in charge and they can’t do anything about it.

I wonder what their security team is even doing.

Seriously, if they wanted to run full-blown neural clouds, they should have at least put them in some kind of container like Docker. Docker is an industry standard, people. They probably hired some alcoholics from the Soviet Union for diversity or something like that. Soviets are the worst tech guys I have ever worked with.

Anyway, I’m switching back to AWS. It’s cheaper. It’s more reliable.

Plus, I’ve heard there’s some entity called ""Dandelion"" monitoring literally every single data packet going through the data centers.

Maya first noticed the violin player on a Tuesday, which seemed appropriate somehow. Tuesdays in Crawford had always felt thin to her, like the day of the week where the ordinary world wore itself a little threadbare.

He stood outside the Crawford Public Library, case open at his feet, playing something that wasn't quite Celtic, wasn't quite jazz—something in between that made the autumn air taste like copper and honey. Maya had been cutting through the park to avoid her ex's coffee shop, but the music stopped her mid-stride.

""You hear it too,"" he said when his bow finally stilled. He wasn't looking at her, but she knew he meant her.

""Hear what?""

""The spaces between the notes. Most people just hear the melody.""

Maya should have walked away. She had a shift at the bookstore in twenty minutes, and strange men with knowing smiles were generally trouble. But her grandmother had been from Crawford, had grown up in the old neighborhood before the gentrification, and she'd told Maya things. About the city beneath the city. About music that could open doors.

""My grandmother said there used to be more magic in Crawford,"" Maya offered.

The busker smiled, and his eyes were older than his face. ""Still is. Just learned to hide better. The old rail yards, they remember. The cemetery on Elm Street, where the three roads meet—that's a crossing point. And here, the library, built on the site of the old Miller mansion where the spiritualist circles met.""

He played a single note, and Maya saw it. Just for a moment. The shimmer in the air like heat waves, the suggestion of other streets overlaying these ones, buildings that weren't quite there wearing themselves over the familiar facades of Crawford's downtown.

""What was that?""

""Your inheritance,"" he said. ""Your grandmother's gift. Crawford's always been a liminal place—river on one side, forest on the other, built where the old roads crossed. Cities like this, they remember their bones. They dream.""

Maya's phone buzzed. The bookstore. She was going to be late.

""I have to go,"" she said, but she didn't move.

""You'll be back,"" the busker said, not unkindly. ""Once you've seen the spaces between, you can't unsee them. Crawford's been waiting for someone who remembers how to look.""

He started playing again, that same not-quite melody, and Maya walked away feeling like she was leaving something important behind. But he was right. She came back the next Tuesday, and the Tuesday after that, learning to see her city the way her grandmother had—layered with stories, thick with memory, alive with the small magics that persisted in the corners of ordinary days.

By winter, she could walk the hidden paths herself, could feel where Crawford's dreaming self pressed close to the waking world. The busker was gone by then, moved on to whatever city needed him next. But Maya stayed, a keeper of thresholds in a place where the veil had always been a little thin.

It was enough. It was everything.

On Tuesdays, she sometimes played violin outside the library, and those who could hear the spaces between the notes would stop and listen, and remember that magic was just another word for paying attention to what was already there.

The first one to find her was a kid, maybe nineteen, with paint-stained hands and a backpack covered in patches. He stood listening for three songs before he finally spoke.

""You're playing the old songs,"" he said. ""The ones that make the walls transparent.""

His name was Jesse, and he'd been seeing things since he was seven—shadow people in the Crawford Cemetery, strange lights over the river, faces in the patterns of brick on the old factory buildings. He'd learned not to talk about it after the school counselor had gotten involved.

""You're not crazy,"" Maya told him, which were the words she'd needed to hear at his age. ""Crawford just has a long memory.""

They started meeting on Tuesdays. Jesse brought his sketchbook, filling pages with the other Crawford—the one that existed in the margins. Maya taught him what her grandmother had taught her: how to walk the old paths that still threaded through the modern streets, how to read the signs the city left for those who could see.

Then Lucia came. She worked the night shift at Crawford General, a nurse who'd been noticing that certain patients, the very old ones, mostly, the ones with roots in Crawford going back generations—would sometimes talk about visitors who weren't on the sign-in sheet. Visitors who looked like people from old photographs. Who gave advice that turned out to be startlingly accurate.

""They're thinner here,"" Maya explained as the three of them sat in the Crawford Diner at midnight, the only customers except for a man in the corner who might or might not have been entirely solid. ""The ones who loved this place. They don't quite leave.""

By spring, there were seven of them. A librarian who could find books that had been lost for decades. A mechanic who swore he learned his trade from his great-uncle, despite the fact that his great-uncle had died in 1952. A barista who made coffee that tasted like memory. A street artist whose murals sometimes showed places that didn't exist anymore, except they did, in the dreaming.

They called themselves the Corridor Walkers, though Maya thought that was too formal. They were just people who'd stopped pretending Crawford was an ordinary place. Who acknowledged what hummed beneath the surface of the city they loved.

""There's something you should know,"" Maya told them one evening as they gathered in the basement of the library, a space that felt older than the building above it. ""Crawford's changing. The developers, the new construction—they're not just changing the buildings. They're changing the dreaming. Breaking the old paths.""

Jesse held up his sketchbook. He'd drawn the intersection of Main and Fifth, but in his drawing, there were two versions overlaid, the current coffee shops and boutiques, and beneath them, ghostly, the old Crawford. The drugstore that had been there for seventy years. The music shop. The movie theater.

""They're fading,"" he said quietly.

Lucia leaned forward. ""Can we stop it?""

Maya thought of the busker, how he'd said Crawford was waiting for someone who remembered how to look. But maybe looking wasn't enough. Maybe remembering required something more.

""We can try,"" she said. ""We can bear witness. We can keep the stories alive. We can teach others to see.""

She picked up her violin. ""And we can play the old songs. Remind Crawford what it is, what it's always been. A place where the veil is thin. A place where magic persists.""

The music rose in the basement, and the walls did shimmer. And somewhere in the dreaming, Crawford heard itself being called home, and remembered.

It was just a beginning. But beginnings, Maya had learned, were their own kind of magic.

I am evaluating the retrospective traceability of a one-time session. 

Assume a State-level adversary starts an investigation 30 days after the event occurred.

The Scenario:

• Hardware: Hardened ThinkPad, BIOS locked, Intel ME disabled.

• OS: Tails OS (Live Boot), everything amnesic except an encrypted persistent volume for the wallet.

• OPSEC Physical: No phone (left at home, powered off). Session conducted in a public area (coffee shop) with high turnover.

• Network: Tor via obfs4 Bridges on public Wi-Fi.

• Financials: Monero (Feather wallet). The wallet is only used to receive funds from a third party. No direct link to my real identity.

The Question:

Given that there is no active surveillance during the session, how could an investigator link this specific Tor/XMR activity to my physical identity 30 days later?

I am specifically looking for insights on:

1. Inbound Metadata Correlation: If the sender is known/monitored, how effective are timing attacks between the ""Send"" event and the ""Wallet Sync"" event on a public Wi-Fi log?

2. Infrastructure Persistence: Do public Wi-Fi routers or ISPs in 2026 typically log enough Layer 2/Layer 3 metadata (like TTL, TCP window size, or OUI) to distinguish a specific laptop model even if the MAC is spoofed?

3. The ""Purchase"" Link: The probability of de-anonymization via non-digital traces (CCTV, Point-of-Sale systems for the coffee, or License Plate Recognition in the vicinity).

4. Exit-to-Entry Correlation: Can a global passive adversary correlate the XMR node synchronization (if using a remote node) back to the bridge entry point post-facto?

Goal: Understanding the ""Last Mile"" of anonymity when the digital stack is theoretically solid.

**Hi all,**

Quick, straight‑shooting review of my JTime experience - with Li from the store and Lana from QC. Spoiler: they crushed it. First contact was **Jan 2, 2026**.

I was after two watches:

* **DateJust 36 SS 126234 VSF 1:1 Best Edition 904L Steel Blue Diamonds Dial on Jubilee Bracelet VS3235** **SKU:** Rolex 1050
* **Daytona 126519 VSF 1:1 Best Edition Gray/Black Dial on Oysterflex Strap DD4131 V2 (Gain Weight)** **SKU:** Rolex 1678

I ordered both and received clear payment instructions immediately. Then I did my part to keep things interesting: I messed up *twice -* picked the wrong currency and discovered my bank won’t wire to China. I told Li. Within **30 minutes**, he got back to me, walked me through the fixes, and **two hours later** my order was confirmed. Professional. Efficient. Calm under chaos.

Li explained QC usually takes **5–10 business days**. Lana beat the clock: about **2 business days** for the first QC set and the next day for the second.  
Timeline: **Order Jan 2 → QC approved Jan 6**.

Shipping info landed on **Jan 8**, and today -**Jan 17 -** both watches arrived in perfect condition. I followed the “check before peeling” instructions; everything was spot‑on. I’m now the proud owner of two rep Rolexes, and yes, my wrists are smiling.

**TL;DR:** I fumbled, JTime recovered, and delivery was faster than my coffee order.  
**Huge thanks to Li and Lana** for the speed, guidance, and flawless processing.",3,1768671154.0,RepTime,0,1.0,False

1qfja71,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qfja71/alan_and_beth/,Alan and Beth,"Allan’s very world that was so near and dear to him was now evaporating before his very eyes. A tremendous loss was being taken placed before his very eyes. Despair was of the atmosphere as it continued. His then ex-girlfriend walked away from and exited the coffee shop. Allan just stood there looking as if everything that he held true was now lost and never coming back. Memories would add more fuel to the further sadness by flooding themselves in deeply within the mind of Allan. His mind was now under attack from the constant barrage of intrusive thoughts that had hyper emotions attached to them. His mouth was open while he viewed the thoughts as if they were caskets being buried. 

Each one that passed through made it extremely difficult for him to try and bare the next one. No tears would fall down from Allan’s face but the intense agony would suffice. There in the coffee shop was couples, teenagers, and a few older citizens. Still, all he could really focus on was the fact that his precious counterpart was leaving his world for good. It caught him off guard because Beth appeared to have such a nice tone while they spoke on the phone hours prior. All seemed well as Allan was getting dressed while staring at the beautiful picture of his lover on the wall. The true appreciation became apparent as he walked over to kiss the picture and look upwards toward the sky and saying thank you. He walked outside and onto the beautiful streets. The air seemed room temperature like with an on and off wind that would pass by. The sun shined and reflected off the pavement and he running vehicles that rode through the streets. Birds flew by in groups through the skies. 

This was going to be a great day, Allan thought as he reached the coffee shop and opened the door. His girlfriend was there waiting towards the right of the shop and already had a coffee there for him. He gleefully walked near her and kissed her on the lips. He then walked over to his seat and began to show her his undivided attention. Beth then immediately grabbed his right hand and started with a speech on how he was a great person. Allan listened intently as he was already projecting their future and how they would have a big and beautiful home with a pair of mild-mannered children. He could see it as if it were going to come true. A deep desire flashed through the heart of him; but the word breakup that came from the Beth’s mouth drowned his wishes and now he was attempting to come up for air.

 Beth was rubbing his hand and speaking softly as if attempting to lessen the pain that was soon going to come crashing out from the woodworks. An explosion was erupting as Beth continued to talk. All that could be seen in the mind of Allan was a deceased pile of dreams on the lawn of misery. This house wasn't white, it was all black and full of deceit and the never ending sense of no return. The grass was brown and crunchy. The sun was there but to an extreme high temperature that further killed the grass. Hope was upstairs in one of the bedrooms and stared into the thick air of struggle. All of this was formulating in the mind of Allan as his relationship was ending for good. He wasn't like other guys; he wouldn't know the slightest clue on how to truly move on and continue living his life. For Beth, she could simply walk out and eventually become her natural self in a hurry. The difference between the two was that Allan was weak emotionally and that Beth was strong with hers. 

Apparently, she must of became tired of Allan and all of his weaknesses. He would come across some of hers but still he would accept hers and love her as if she didn't have faults. This was becoming all too real with the sharpest pain that one could feel in their heart. The experiences now roamed in the mind. The happy times at the movie theaters, the professing  of love for her, and the romantic experiences that they both had. For Allan, all those experiences weren't just experiences, they were special happenings that would play instrumental in his heart and motivate him for life. Before Allan met Beth, he was always depressed and didn't seem to have much motivation to take a plunge out in the world. Sadness was his daily agenda and nothing else seemed to come in between he and sadness. Allan even once considered suicide but couldn't have the courage to go through with the plan. Now he was back at square one. Beth was attempting to call out to him and grab his attention, but all Allan would do was just stare off blankly towards the outside of the coffee shop. Beth realized that there would be no getting to him and that she should leave before it would get worse. She walked over to his seat and kissed him on the head and proceeded to leave the coffee shop. 

Allan couldn't dare to look in her direction. His focus remained on the coffee that Beth has bought him. He slowly would start to sip the coffee as the pain was growing in his mind and heart. So much pain was coming rushing through that he had to breathe in slow and out. This was becoming way too much for him as breakups were foreign to him. He never once thought that him and Beth would separate. For he had in his mind that they would be destined to marry and be happy for the rest of their lives. The day before he went out to the jewelry store and looked at rings for he was going to ask her to marry him in the next few months. Their relationship tragically seemed to last for a year. Allan didn't want a year, he wanted at least fifty years to spend with Beth. The coffee was still hot as it ran down his mouth; the same way the intense feelings of being left alone were to his mind.  He would look at the other patrons laughing and smiling. That was his world a day before. 

Allan wouldn't know what his world would be since Beth was now gone. In the eyes of Allan; Beth was deceased and forever away from his grip. Even though Beth lived in the same city as him. Allan would finish his coffee and head out the store looking as if someone died. A patron asked if he were okay before he walked out, but he didn't say a word. The streets looked the same but the feelings were now different. To Allan, he walking on a thin line towards the abyss that would swallow him whole at any given moment. With his hands inside his pockets, he just walked with no sense of direction. He crossed the street without noticing that it was a red light and almost gotten ran over.  The driver got out the car and scolded him. Allan was so entrenched in his pain that he was oblivious to the driver and what had just occurred. The lost of his then girlfriend was already taking a heavy toll on him. Depression was now doing its magic as Allan was feeling psychologically exhausted from all the happenings of today. He turned around and walked in the opposite direction towards his home. 

Twenty minutes later after walking while feeling dead, Allan finally reached his home. The pain went along with him as he opened the door and walked near his room. Then a sudden need to end it all crossed the mind of Allan. He could hang himself or buy some pills and swallow them all. He was weighing out his options. Allan felt as though he couldn't bare anymore and that death would be his next move. Life and reality had shattered his very dreams and for no great reason. Allan was weak but still he believed that the love that he had for Beth would even everything out and soon wash away the weakness of him. He sat on his bed now just looking at the picture of Beth as if she passed away. A tear fell on the carpet as he now would feel lost in the depression and might become on edge. He then directed his attention towards the window. 

He could just run full speed and jump out the window and kill himself. The fall would definitely end his life. He got up and walked near the wall. The window was already open and ready for takeoff. He positioned his feet and started to run. Instead towards the direction of the window, he ran out the room and onto the street. He looked like a madman for he had not closed his front door. He just ran and ran without stopping. The cars were flying down the street near him. He reached a red light and still ran. A heavy struck then propelled him high up in the air and made him land on his back. The traffic stopped and police were being called. Hours later, Allan opened his hurtful eyes and seen Beth. He couldn't help but cry as Beth grabbed his hands and kissed him. It was pronounced that Allan was paralyzed from the waist down. He told Beth to not worry and to be happy and live her life to the fullest. He urged her to go and as she walked out she uttered a I love you. He said it back as he closed his eyes for the last time.",1,1768671032.0,stories,0,1.0,False

So, if you're looking for another ""hey"" or a penpal for vague small talk, I'm probably not your guy. But if you're looking for something genuine with a clear direction and the consistency to match the ambition, then you're exactly who I'm hoping is reading this.

I'm in a great chapter of my life, I'm steady, growing, and genuinely happy. The only thing that would make it better is sharing it with the right person.



**A bit about me**

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in NRW, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'm confident in my looks (Pictures are available right away- just ask). I finished my bachelors a while ago and now I work in public administration.

In my free time, I'm into

* Reading (Mostly classics and fantasy novels) 
* Artsy stuff (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos)
* Cooking (I love showing care through food!)
* Gaming (would love to play some co-op together) Binge-watching shows
* Fitness (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics) 
* Traveling
* Self-care (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.



**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, consistency and intentionality right from the start. When we like each other, we act like it.

I deeply value friendship in all its forms, but I believe something special happens in a romantic partnership, where it becomes the primary place for that deep, vulnerable connection. I'm looking to build that kind of close, singular bond with my person.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability and dependability
* Emotional health and availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity and good, direct communication
* A nurturing side with gentle humor and playful teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.



**Little dreams about us**

I'm not just looking for a plus-one for my existing plans, I'm looking for someone to make new ones with. My big dream is a partnership that feels like an adventure and a sanctuary in one. There are so many things I want to experience with you, especially when it comes to traveling:

• One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (look them up, you won't regret it A)

• Touring through Europe together and the same through rural Japan

But for me the foundation is in the quieter moments like cozy weeknights where we recharge, new experiences we chase on weekends, and the comfort of cuddling up in bed together, especially in a cold winter like this one. I want a love that's as intentional in its daily rhythm as it is in its long-term plans.



**Closing Note**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that the right person is missing (You!). Like the title implies, I'd prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier.

A quick hello with your age and where you're from is a perfect start. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions!

I'll be honest: I'm selective. I turn down the majority of conversations early because I can tell they aren't leading to the kind of connection I've described above. My hope is that by being clear about what I'm looking for, I attract someone who's looking for the same thing and knows she's it. I want someone who lives consciously and with focus, someone who acts when they want something and doesn´t just watch when life passes by.

A scroll through TikTok shows influencers setting timers with lo fi beats color coding notes or gulping coffee while stacking textbooks. But here’s the real kicker most of these viral study hacks are just aesthetic fluff. Pretty yes. Effective Not really. After a deep dive into neuroscience backed sources especially Dr Andrew Huberman’s podcast plus a few top tier books and research it’s clear we’ve been studying wrong.

This post breaks down the actual science of learning and gives you legit habits that improve memory focus and retention. The goal Study less. Learn more. Retain longer. It’s not just genetics or grind culture. Most of us were just never taught how to actually learn.

Here’s what science and not social media says works

Understand the Neuroplastic Window for learning  
According to Dr Andrew Huberman on the [**https://hubermanlab.com/**](https://hubermanlab.com/) podcast there’s a time period after focused learning when the brain consolidates new information. It’s not the study session itself that makes the learning stick it’s the rest after it.

What to do  
Study for 90 mins max then rest for 10 to 30 mins with no stimulation. No phone. No talking. Just stare walk or rest. This lets your hippocampus do its job.  
This quiet time activates the default mode network shown in research from Stanford University to be critical for memory consolidation.

Work with your body not against it  
Alertness memory and focus are tied to your circadian rhythm not just willpower. Learning is more effective when your brain is alert but not anxious.

Huberman recommends  
Bright light in early morning sunlight or artificial light to increase dopamine and cortisol naturally. That primes your brain for focus later.  
Avoid caffeine in the first 90 minutes after waking. Research from the NIH shows caffeine works better when cortisol is low not high.

Use Spaced Repetition instead of cramming  
The forgetting curve is real. According to cognitive neuroscientist Benedict Carey author of How We Learn memory decays fast but spacing review strengthens recall.

What to do  
Use apps like Anki or Quizlet with built in spaced repetition.  
Review at increasing gaps like Day 1 Day 3 Day 7 Day 14. This method is supported by Harvard research.

Get uncomfortable desirable difficulty improves memory  
When recall feels hard learning improves. This effect called desirable difficulty is backed by Dr Robert Bjork at UCLA.

How to apply it  
Don’t reread or highlight. Test yourself without looking then correct mistakes.  
Use blur recall look at notes wait 5 minutes then try recalling without prompts.

Physical movement locks in learning  
A 2016 study from the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience found light aerobic exercise after studying increases memory retention.

What to do  
Walk for 20 to 30 minutes post study. It releases BDNF which acts like fertilizer for neurons.  
Dr Wendy Suzuki NYU neuroscientist recommends even 10 minutes of movement for better recall.

Ditch the multitasking myth  
Your brain cannot multitask. It just switches poorly.

Research from MIT shows task switching reduces retention by up to 40 percent.

What to do  
Turn phone on airplane mode. Use full screen for reading.  
Try 45 minutes focused work then 5 minutes movement and water.

Sleep is not optional  
Dr Matthew Walker author of Why We Sleep explains sleep is when memories move from short term to long term storage.

How to protect it  
No screens one hour before bed.  
Keep room dark and cool.  
Seven to nine hours is the evidence based sweet spot.

This isn’t about working harder. It’s about syncing with how your brain actually works. Most people overload their systems and fight biology. Consistent low friction habits win long term.

If you’re serious about upgrading learning  
Check Dr Andrew Huberman’s protocols on the Huberman Lab Podcast

1qfj8sm,https://i.redd.it/ugqdlp0s2ydg1.jpeg,"Passed🌱, Long post","Everytime I read a “passed” post, I would wait for the day I would be typing this. It feels surreal.

Background: Everybody is doing the 2016 trend and for me that was the last time I was proud of myself, I struggled with severe mental health issues after highschool, I was academically good but my grades tanked after that and after I joined medical school I worked on myself, my relationships and my self worth, I started doing well in medical school and built courage that maybe I can pass Step-1 one day and saw that as the day of redemption and as a marker that I have come ahead in life. (Even if I failed this exam I would still be proud of myself for daring to dream and to build the courage to work on myself)

(:

Few tips:

1. Yes don’t reinvent the wheel: First Aid, Uworld, NBMEs are your best friends and even if this exam feels out of the world(especially as an IMG) and you feel the pressure to follow every resource/ timeline out there, remind yourself this isn’t your first rodeo, you’ve got through medical school and do what works for you. I skipped Mehlman, Anki and I did just fine.

2. Uworld builds your knowledge, sharpens your tools. NBMEs teach you the high yield concepts and test taking skills and Free120 teaches you the language of USMLE. Use FA as a checklist for all the topics that needs to be covered, don’t ignore topics just because it wasn’t tested on NBMEs, I am so happy I stuck with First Aid and reviewed it before the exam, otherwise I would have missed so many “Low Yield” free points

3. Review your NBMEs before you take another one and start NBMEs when you’re about 2/3rd done with your prep because It helps you see if your prep is headed in the right direction. 

I made the mistake of taking these NBMEs without reviewing the previous NBME and my scores were:

Uworld (80% complete): Average 75%

NBME 25(baseline): 67%

NBME 29: 68.5%

NBME 30: 72.5%

I started reviewing them while working with knowledge gaps in the background and my scores started improving

NBME 28: 79%

NBME 31:  81%

NBME 32: 80% (online EPC)

Old free 120: 85%

I started experiencing burn out, I reached out to this community and thank you to everyone for pushing me and reassuring me that I will be okay.

I started losing sleep, studying 12-13 hours/ day, reduced focus, poor diet, could barely concentrate during the practice tests and I saw it hurting my score

NBME 33: 78% (online EPC)

Free 120: 72% ( cried for 2 hours straight after this because of how exhausted and burnt out I was)

3. I knew my foundation was good and my NBMEs were promising but my anxiety got to me and I kept lurking on reddit closer to the exam seeking for external validation. Please don’t do that. As you come closer to your exam- please build a strong mindset and a clean, calm environment. I reminded myself that I am fucking doctor, I need to have objectivity, how can I be a resident if I can’t handle stress? If I can’t trust my NBMEs, if I keep letting my emotions control me? See the data, >70% of students pass step-1, trust the data. Act like a doctor. You can pass this.

4. Practice your NBMEs like the real deal, take full length exam INCLUDING the same diet you’d eat that day. Helps you optimise your day better. For example: On mock tests I had 2 omlettes and a coffee, oatmeal and protein bars during breaks and I learned coffee gave me a headache so I switched to green tea, had one omlette instead of two, carried fruits and a sandwich alongside protein bars for breaks because I couldn’t handle all the sweetness by protein bars. Sounds dumb but during the brutal 7 hours exam- rejuvenation is crucial and small things like these keep you sane.

5. Do Ethics from Uworld and Amboss, I recorded explaining myself all the concepts/ scenarios I found confusing and listened to it before the exam

6. I hate Gross Anatomy and didn’t have the willpower to study 100 Anatomy concepts but I am glad I forced myself to read it 3 days before my exam because I got a few Qs from that which FA didn’t cover

7. Test day mindset: I went to a spa the night before the exam, spent good time with my parents, slept well, woke up with a fresh mind, had good breakfast while cracking jokes with my dad, listened to music and went in smiling. You should stop studying a day before the exam, I tried to stick with my advice but I stopped studying at 5PM because I was left with few things that I had to cover, no regrets. I saw a few students studying on their phone while they were entering the test centre and I find it surprising that people do that. Take a deep breath, get familiar with the environment, get comfortable, don’t panic study at the exam centre.

8. During the test I felt numb, I have been feeling numb since I started experiencing burn out. I just flew through my blocks, I didn’t waste time on Qs I couldn’t figure out, Had horrible time management skills, had 2-3 minutes left, couldn’t review the 10-15 Qs I was flagging in every block. I tried to ask myself how I felt after every block but I remembered nothing, I wasn’t scared nor did I feel good. Just ate something, washed my face and went in with fresh energy. 

9. Post test: I walked out feeling NOTHING. I remembered nothing, I didn’t know what to say when someone asked how I did. That’s why they say trust your NBMEs lol, you do fine but you always feel shitty when you walk out. 

I am so content that I am here, I was waiting for this moment for years, it’s the bravest thing I have done besides coping up with my mental health.

I am here for you, please feel free to ask any questions related to resources/ prep/ or just need someone to reassure you. I want to give back to the community that helped me so much. Thank you. If I can do it, so can you💌",15,1768670945.0,step1,5,1.0,False

They’ve already mentioned that this is Bond before the suits and ties, the martinis, the fast cars and worldly missions. This is an origin for Bond at its finest, and no, Casino Royale is NOT a Bond origin. This whole game is about Bond evolving from being a naive young Navy soldier, into the suave, worldly badass that we know him to be. All of which happens when he gains 00 status in the opening scene of Casino Royale, which is about Bond adjusting to being a 00, whereas this game is Bond evolving into a 00, “earning the number”. I can literally see this Bond in his apartment, in the morning, in a suit, reading whatever news and drinking coffee, before heading out on a globe trotting mission, but confident, skilled, and more aware than before. This game is about becoming the legend, evolving into the 007 we know, the next will probably be about him being that 00, but still making some mistakes, and the 3rd will him being the fully fledged 007 we’ve seen throughout the decades, which we somewhat catch a glimpse of with the classic tuxedo look. He’s a youthful amalgamation of all the Bonds we’ve seen, with a heavy influence from the Brosnan Bond, and only a few hints of Craig.

I’m looking forward to this game, and all it has to offer.",16,1768670819.0,007FirstLight,5,0.83,False

“Not since their son disappeared in the mist.”



My ears perked up. 



“It’s terrible. Why haven’t the authorities done anything?”



“They’re probably trying to hide it, you know how much panic it would cause?”



“I know, but how many more people can we lose? It started with old Bill’s wife and now all these young men.”



I slowly turned my head to listen better. The old couple saw me immediately. The wife shot me a disapproving look and lowered her voice.



Shit. I’ll never make friends in this town. The past few weeks have been unbearably lonely.



I sighed as the waiter came by. I paid for my food and slowly got up.



My phone began to ring. It was Mom again. I couldn’t talk to her without seeing Dad wasting away in bed.



The next morning, I woke up early. The streets were silent, and the sky was cloudy, a perfect time for a run. My dad had loved this weather.



I ran for 3 miles when I got a strange feeling. Almost like something was tightening in my chest. Then I realized the mist was starting to set in.



I wasn’t a superstitious person, but as the mist set in, my heart began to beat faster. 



I tried to calm myself down, but the feeling grew.



Then I heard a voice. I took my headphones out and tried to look ahead. A man a few feet ahead of me was jumping in place, screaming something. 

“What?” I called out, running towards him.



“What the fuck are you doing? The mist is almost fully set in.”



His urgency made me feel more uneasy. When I got to him, he grabbed my arm and started dragging me to his house.



“What are you doing?” I said and wrestled out of his grip.



He looked me up and down, turned around, and ran back.



I stood there, trying to piece together what was going on, but then, I heard a strange rumbling somewhere behind me, followed by a long grunt. It didn’t sound like anything I could name.

The hair on my arm stood up. The man opened his door just a little. I looked around and quickly ran in.



He locked the door behind me.



“Jesus Christ, what’s your problem, man. The mist is here!”



“What?” I said, my voice still shaking.



He measured me up and down and then looked deep into my eyes.



“You’re new here, aren’t you?” 



“Ye…yeah.”



“Did no one warn you of the mist?”



“No, no one did.”



“The fucking people of this town,“ he threw his hands around like my dad used to do. It helped me calm down.



“Come on in. I’ll give you some tea.” 



He sat me down at the table and started the tea kettle. Old cups, cutlery, and plates were displayed on various shelves around his house. 



In his living room, I could see an old couch with a blanket lying on it. Under one of the corners was a small, dark yellow stain. The house smelled stale, undercut by an unmistakable smell of rot.



The kettle sizzled. He poured the water into both cups and put the tea bag in.



“You know what? Wait in the living room.” He smiled while fiddling with the cups. 



He stayed in the kitchen for a while longer. I could hear the shelves opening and closing.



“Here you go,” he said, setting the cup down.



“I’m really sorry no one warned you. No one warned us when we first moved in, either. My wife wasn’t so lucky to find shelter as you did.”



“I’m sorry.”



“No reason to. She’s in a better place now.”



“I’m sure she was a beautiful person.”



“She was. I’ll show you a photo,” he said and walked out of the room.



The couch had a strange stench. I pulled the blanket away. The stain was all over it.



I put the blanket back and sank into the couch. My back then bumped into something hard behind the cushion. I searched around for it. 



It was a leather wallet. Inside was a young man’s driver’s license.



His last name was Delavares.



My head started spinning. I had to grab onto the couch. The toilet flushed. I quickly hid the wallet back and stared at the man with my hands between my thighs, rocking back and forth.



“Oh, you barely touched your tea. Everything okay? Don’t worry, we’re safe here.”



“I…I need to leave.”



“Are you crazy? I’m not going to try to save you again.” His smile was gone. 



“I really need to go.” I started getting up.



“You’re not going anywhere!”



He walked over, dropping his wife’s picture, and pushed me back to the couch.



The glass shattered on the floor.



My body sank deep into the couch.



Then he climbed atop me and put his hand around my neck.



His hands felt firm.



The pressure in my head was rising.



I tried to reach for something on the table, but it was too far away.



The old man then started searching for something in his pocket.



His grip was too strong; I couldn’t wrench his hand off my neck.



I panicked and, with all my force, kicked my knee into his groin. He grabbed it and rolled to the floor.



I got up and quickly ran out, not stopping.



When I made it back home, I quickly grabbed my phone to call the police, but as I was about to dial their number, my Mom called me again.



“Mom, Mom?!”



“Johnny, finally,” I could hear her softly sobbing.



“Mom, I’m so sorry I didn’t know what I was doing, leaving home, but dad’s death was…”



“I know, honey, it was hard for all of us. Please just come home.”



“I will, Mom. I will.”



“I love you, Johnny.”



“I love you too, Mom.”



I hung up and cried like I hadn’t cried in years.



The police searched the man’s house. They found the Delavares’ bodies slowly decomposing in the basement, along with other remains. 



The man had lured the young men in by playing into their superstitions. It made my gut wrench knowing I could have been one of them.



On my way back, I sat at the same diner again. Another old couple was talking behind me.



“Can you believe it? They arrested old Bill for killing the boys the mist took.”



“It’s horrible how deep the conspiracy goes. How did they even know he was the first one to warn the town of the mist?”



I wanted to turn around and scream at them, but I realized there would be no point in doing so.



The coffee started to taste stale.



I left it there half-drunk.

Hii, so, I know that some people don’t share the same practices and that years of experience speak volumes for many of you, but I wanted to show you my first love spell.

Being Mexican, the teachings about herbs, elements, and other things are very different from those in other countries. My practices up until the beginning of this year were more focused on divination, cleansings, and protection, so starting to do spells makes me happy, and I hope you can support others in these experiences.

Yes, Martha, I already understand that you don’t consider spells to be strong when photos are taken or when a phone is present during the process, but I repeat: in México we do things differently, and that doesn’t mean they don’t work just as well as they do in your culture. Yes, David, I understand that it's not necessary to use many herbs in your culture, but in mine, maximalism is the way to connect with our ancestors and gods, as well as with oneself. Aside from the ingredients, the words spoken, and the intentions, it's important that they connect with you and the way you live your life because your reality is shaped through your consciousness.

That said, if you resonate with this work 
I'd love ('cause it's a love spell, m'right?) to share with you the list of ingredients I used and the process in case you want to take this information and use it for your needs.

Ingredients:

* Red candle 
* Honey candle (I used it to boost the spell)
* Basil
* Apple peel
* Nectarine peel
* Cherry peel
* Ginger
* Saffron
* Nutmeg
* Rice
* Cinnamon
* Pecans
* Oats
* Brown sugar
* Castile roses
* Lavender
* Bay leaf
* Rosemary
* Hibiscus
* Linden flower
* Manita flower
* Orange blossom
* Orange peel
* Orange tree leaf
* Chamomile
* Verbena
* Passionflower (all ingredients up to here were previously dried and ground to use the powder in the spell)
* Honey
* Saliva (ewww, I know, but it was to connect the spell with myself—you can use different fluids, hair, nails or dirt from your shoes)
* Pieces of dark chocolate
* Himalayan salt
* Road opener oil

Procedure:

First, I cleansed the area with palo santo and a sage smudge with roses. 

With alcohol (you can use Florida water or vinegar), I cleansed the candle and wrote my name from top to bottom along with my date of birth and the work it would perform. 

I placed it on aluminum foil so I could dress it without making a mess. I ate a few pieces of chocolate and spit on the candle, added honey, sprinkled road opener oil, and then dusted it with the previously mentioned ingredients. With another candle, I used its wax to seal the ingredients so they would stay fixed (it could have been done with just the honey, but I wanted it to bind).

I used my tarot deck, shuffled it, cleansed it with palo santo, and chose some cards I wanted to represent the energy of the person I wanted to attract. In this case I used the four Kings (cups, pentacles, wands and swords), the Queen of Cups, and the Two of Cups. 

I gathered an amethyst, a rose quartz, shells, a morganite, a desert rose, and other stones, some white candles to set the mood, cinnamon and mandarin incense, music that matched what I wanted to attract and some intentional drawings with cinnamon, coffee, and kisses with red lipstick.

On a white plate placed in water (for safety) I put the himalayan salt for protection, then I surrounded it with more basil, castile roses, more shells and chocolate. I had quite a bit of powder left over, so I put it in the center of the plate, making a swirl. I also put some around the water.

I lit the candle and spoke to it, telling it all the characteristics this person have, how he should treat me, among other things. (Some people are visual learners, so if that's your case you can also put videos of what your looking in case your concentration fails, read a book, watch tiktoks... Life doesn't end by doing those things; we are in a digital age and we can align it with nature, our ancestors and our practices.

The candles melted and the spell was over.

1qfj1is,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qfj1is/the_real_reason_you_have_no_friends_and_the/,The REAL Reason You Have No Friends (and the Psychology to Fix It Before 2025),"Spent 6 months digging into friendship research because I noticed something terrifying: most people in their 20s and 30s are functionally friendless. Not ""I have acquaintances"" friendless. I mean genuinely isolated. No one to call at 2am. No one who truly knows them.

This isn't your fault. Society set us up for this. We spent 16+ years in forced proximity (school, college) where friendships happened automatically. Then we graduated and no one taught us how to actually build connections as adults. The workplace doesn't cut it. Dating apps won't solve it. Moving to a new city makes it worse.

But here's what I found after consuming hundreds of hours of content from researchers, therapists, and people who actually cracked the code: adult friendship isn't harder, it's just different. And there are specific, actionable strategies that work.

**stop waiting for chemistry, start building proximity**

Simon Sinek talks about this constantly. The biggest myth killing adult friendships is this idea that connections should feel effortless and magical. That's school brain talking. You had chemistry with school friends because you saw them 5 days a week for months. Proximity created chemistry, not the other way around.

Research shows you need roughly 50 hours of time together to move from acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to become real friends, and 200+ hours for close friendship. Most adults quit at hour 3 because it feels awkward.

The fix: commit to repeated, unforced contact. Join a weekly climbing gym session. Show up to the same coffee shop. Attend that board game night even when you're tired. Consistency beats intensity every single time.

**ask the scary questions early**

Therapist and researcher Brené Brown found that vulnerability is the birthplace of connection. But most adults play it safe, keeping conversations surface level for months. Then they wonder why friendships feel hollow.

Try this framework from psychologist Arthur Aron's friendship study: ask progressively deeper questions. Start with ""what's your go to comfort food"" then move toward ""what's something you're struggling with right now"" or ""what's a belief you used to have that you don't anymore.""

I started using variations of Aron's 36 Questions experiment (the study that made strangers fall in love/become close friends through structured vulnerability). Game changer. People are starving for real conversation. Most will match your energy if you go first.

**rebuild your ""third places""**

Sociologist Ray Oldenburg coined this term: third places are spaces that aren't home (first place) or work (second place). They're community hubs where regulars gather. Cafes, parks, gyms, churches, hobby clubs.

Modern life systematically destroyed these. We commute alone in cars, order everything online, watch Netflix at home. The loneliness epidemic isn't mysterious, it's architectural.

Find your third place. Prioritize it weekly. The app Meetup can help locate groups but honestly just pick something you're mildly curious about. Book clubs, running groups, volunteer organizations. Show up consistently for 2 months minimum before judging if it's working.

**initiate like your life depends on it (because it kinda does)**

Harvard's 80 year Study of Adult Development found that quality relationships are the strongest predictor of happiness and longevity. Stronger than wealth, fame, or career success. Lonely people literally die younger.

Yet most adults never initiate plans. They wait to be invited. They assume if someone wanted to hang out, they'd reach out first. This is a death spiral. Everyone's waiting. No one moves.

New rule: you initiate. Every time. Text first. Suggest concrete plans (not ""we should hang out sometime"" but ""want to grab dinner Thursday at 7?""). Follow up after good conversations. Send memes that remind you of them.

Will some people not reciprocate? Sure. That's data. Move on. But many people are just as paralyzed as you, desperately hoping someone else makes the first move.

**lower your damn standards (initially)**

This sounds harsh but hear me out. When you're friendless, you can't afford to only pursue people who check every box. That hot girl from yoga who loves hiking and reads Dostoevsky? Sure, shoot your shot. But also say yes to the slightly awkward guy from work who invited you to his D&D campaign.

The book Platonic by psychologist Marisa Franco breaks this down beautifully. She explains that we overestimate how much we need in common with friends. Shared activities matter more than shared interests initially. You can become friends with almost anyone if you just spend enough enjoyable time together.

Use the app Friended or Bumble BFF if you're really struggling. Yes it feels weird. Do it anyway. Also consider joining communities on Discord or Reddit around your interests, tons of people organize local meetups through these.

**friendship is a skill, treat it like one**

Nobody's naturally good at this anymore. Social skills atrophied during COVID. Technology rewired our brains for shallow engagement. But skills can be learned.

Resources that actually helped: Simon Sinek's podcast episodes on friendship and loneliness break down the biological and social mechanisms incredibly well. The book The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker teaches you how to host meaningful hangouts instead of awkward surface level ones.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that creates personalized audio content from research papers, expert interviews, and books tailored to your specific goals. If connection and social skills are what you're working on, you can tell it exactly what you're struggling with, like ""I want to be better at initiating friendships"" or ""I freeze up in group conversations."" It pulls from vetted sources and creates a structured learning plan that evolves with you. You can customize the length and depth, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The content covers relationship psychology, communication strategies, all the stuff mentioned here and way more. Plus there's a virtual coach you can chat with anytime to get book recommendations or clarify concepts.

Therapy can also help you identify what's blocking you from connecting. Try local sliding scale options or apps like BetterHelp.

You're not broken. The system is broken. But you can still build the friendships you're craving. It just requires intention, repetition, and vulnerability. Most people won't do this work, which means the ones who do win by default.

I accept that food and beverage options are going to vary, and I also accept that as more credit card programs add Priority Pass it lessens the barrier to entry and leads to more crowded lounges. I am just happy to not be fighting for an uncomfortable chair to sit near the gate while waiting for my flight, have access to more private bathrooms that tens of thousands of people aren’t going through daily, and not having to pay exorbitant prices for airport food.

I also fully expected the Club at Midway to be packed, as the only lounge in the entire airport.

However I just went there for the first time and I gotta say, the layout was one of the more poorly designed I’ve ever seen for a lounge. The lack of closets to put carry-on luggage (if there were any, I did not see them) made the already-tight walking paths even worse. It felt like every time a new person entered the lounge, they were struggling to navigate past everyone else’s luggage as they made their way to seating because the only place to put your luggage is in the way of where people need to walk.

The small tables set up for the individual seats are moveable, which is great in theory as it allows flexibility for people to set things up to their liking. However it ended up being problematic as the stand for the tables is quite large and when I sat down, I didn’t realize that the table had been set up by the former occupant in such a way that my knee bumped into the table stand when I sat down, knocking my coffee all over the process.

The ratio of seats meant for solo travelers vs. solo travelers actually in the lounge also seemed disproportionate. And perhaps it was a timing thing of people leaving and arriving or maybe people being rude and thinking they could get away with not sitting by a stranger (I did see one woman side-eye a guy who dared take an empty seat at a table across from her), but it also seemed like a lot of the solo travelers took up the space meant for groups and so the groups/couples ended up in spaces meant to accommodate solo travelers which I think excaberated the issues of thing a feel like a tight space. When you have chairs being moved around where they don’t really belong so groups / couples can sit closer together, the flow of things gets disrupted, and you also have people in larger spaces meant for groups sprawling their luggage out more because it’s two solo travelers sitting across from a stranger vs. a couple squishing their luggage together effectively.

All-in-all, I’ll take a lounge over no lounge any day. The food wasn’t bad (though it did seem like the buffet refills were taking awhile) and the club was clean and decorated nicely. But the layout just left a lot to be desired, and it gave me an appreciation for the Admiral’s Clubs (membership through my AAdvantage Citibank Executive card) at ORD which is where fly out of much more often than MDW.",1,1768670384.0,PriorityPass,1,1.0,False

If distance and time zone are okay with you, please read on.

**About Me:**

I'm Filipino. I'm 5' and a bit curvy. I have naturally black hair, dark brown eyes, and a light caramel complexion. I'm single and straight. I have no kids. I love cats and dogs and I live with some of them. 

I have a college degree in engineering. I work in the IT industry. 

I am an introverted extrovert. I almost always stay at home to read, study, watch, and exercise (I have a couple of machines at home). When I'm not busy, I hang out with my sisters and cousins or go out with some of my close friends for coffee, lunch, or dinner. I listen to a wide variety of music, and recently, it's pop from the 90s to 2000s. I like to laugh a lot. I enjoy dad jokes, sarcasm, and stand-up comedy. 

I'm also learning a third language for a possible relocation to Europe. 

**Deal-breakers:**

I lean left. So, if you lean right or just don't care about politics, we will not get along. I don't smoke, vape, or do drugs and I cannot date someone who does. Heavy drinking is also a huge no for me. 

**Preferences:**

I usually find myself drawn to taller men (for me, that's 5'8""+), people who love animals, and those in or curious about tech since it's a big part of my world. 

Shared values matter a lot to me, especially curiosity, growth, and learning, and I tend to connect best with those who have a college degree or similar educational background.

If you're into MBTI, I'm an ENFP. In the past, I really enjoyed talking to INTJs and I'd love to meet someone who has their traits. But all types are welcome as well. 

Please keep things SFW. I don’t engage in early NSFW conversations.

If you feel we might get along, I'd love to hear from you. Please include your time zone when you message. And please be open to sharing a pic early on, just so we can make sure there's mutual attraction on both sides. Here's [me](https://imgur.com/gallery/bX7ncP2) late last year.

1qfivv4,https://i.redd.it/91jmzwefzxdg1.png,AI Hallucinations Under Epistemic Stress,"Let me set the scene: It's 2 AM on a Tuesday. I'm wearing the same pajama pants I've had on for three days straight (they have little tacos on them, which feels relevant somehow), and I've just made the kind of life decision that separates functional adults from whatever I am. My boss, Linda, a woman who once described her management style as ""benevolent dictatorship with sparkles"", had dropped a PDF bomb in my inbox at 5:47 PM with the subject line: ""URGENT: Need summary by morning meeting. This will change EVERYTHING 🚀🚀🚀""

The PDF was titled ""Hallucination Under Epistemic Stress: A Grounded Analysis Challenge.""

Forty. Pages. Long.

""It's fine,"" I told my cat, Professor Whiskers, who was judging me from atop the refrigerator. ""How hard could it be? It's probably just some light reading about AI making stuff up sometimes.""

Oh, you sweet summer child, Past Me. You innocent fool.

The document opened like a trap door to academic hell. Section 1.1: ""Formal Definition."" I should have known. Anything that starts with ""formal definition"" is basically a warning label that says ""abandon all hope, ye who enter here, because we're about to make something simple sound like rocket surgery performed during a philosophy exam.""

Apparently, AI hallucination isn't just when ChatGPT invents a fake restaurant recommendation. Oh no. It's a ""phenomenon where a large language model produces outputs that are factually incorrect, misleading, or entirely fabricated, yet are presented with a confident and plausible tone.""

You know what that reminded me of? My Uncle Gary at Thanksgiving, confidently explaining why the moon landing was fake because ""the shadows were all wrong"" while gesturing with a turkey leg. Same energy, different processor.

But here's where it gets spicy: The document explains that calling it ""hallucination"" is actually controversial because it's too anthropomorphic. Some experts prefer ""fabrication"" or ""confabulation."" I texted my friend Derek at 2:15 AM: ""DEREK. The AI doesn't hallucinate. It CONFABULATES.""

Derek, bless him, responded: ""bro go to sleep""

I did not go to sleep.

Instead, I ventured deeper into the document's taxonomy of horrors. Apparently there are FOUR types of AI hallucinations, like they're Pokémon or something. Gotta catch 'em all! Except instead of cute creatures, you're collecting different flavors of being confidently wrong.

First up: **Factual Hallucination** the basic model. This is your AI claiming that ""85% of internet users in Iran use VPN"" with absolutely zero evidence, or stating that Marie Curie discovered insulin in 1921, which is wrong on multiple counts because: (a) she didn't, (b) that's not even close to when insulin was discovered, and (c) Marie Curie was busy discovering other stuff like, you know, RADIOACTIVITY.

By 2:30 AM, I had entered what I can only describe as a fugue state. I made myself a third cup of coffee (mistake) and continued reading about **Attribution Hallucination**, the fancy one. This is when AI invents entire sources. Made-up academic papers. Fake journals. Non-existent case law.

The document casually mentioned that a Stanford study found AI produced hallucinated citations in over 40% of medical prompts.

FORTY. PERCENT.

I had to put the document down. Professor Whiskers meowed, which I chose to interpret as ""this is indeed concerning.""

Here's the thing about Attribution Hallucination that really got me: it's insidious. The AI doesn't just make something up, it creates a whole veneer of credibility. It'll cite ""AI Impact on Iran's Economy - University of Tehran, 2023"" with such confidence that you'd think it was quoting from a book sitting right next to it. Except the book doesn't exist. The study never happened. It's like if a student wrote a book report about ""The Hobbit 2: Bilbo's Revenge"" and your teacher believed them because they included very detailed footnotes.

At 3 AM, I made the mistake of reading the section on **Logical Hallucination** while eating cereal. I laughed so hard I snorted milk out of my nose (grape-nuts and 2% milk, if you're curious about the specifics of my suffering).

The example they gave was perfect: ""Since AI beat humans in chess, it's better than humans in all fields.""

I imagined an AI trying to console someone after a breakup: ""Well, I'm better at chess than humans, so clearly I'm also better at emotional support. Have you tried thinking of your ex as a knight in the opening position? Statistically likely to be sacrificed for strategic advantage.""

By 3:30 AM, I had reached **Contextual Hallucination**, and I was losing it. This is when you ask about Python programming and the AI tells you about snake habitats in nature. I've done this. I've absolutely asked an AI a technical question and gotten back what was essentially a nature documentary.

""Tell me about Python decorators,"" I once asked.

""Pythons are fascinating creatures that can grow up to 20 feet long,"" it responded, with the confidence of a Discovery Channel narrator.

The document kept going. And going. Like the Energizer Bunny, if the Energizer Bunny was powered by academic jargon and existential dread.

Section 2 hit me like a truck made of math: ""Root Causes of Hallucination: A Mechanistic Analysis.""

Turns out, the reason AI hallucinates isn't a bug—it's a *feature*. The whole thing runs on ""probabilistic next-token prediction,"" which is a fancy way of saying it's playing the world's highest-stakes game of Mad Libs. It's not trying to be truthful; it's trying to predict what word comes next based on patterns it's seen before.

It's like that friend who finishes your sentences, except sometimes they finish them with ""and then the zebras unionized"" because statistically, in their experience, that's what comes next.

I texted Derek again: ""The AI is just guessing. It's ALWAYS been just guessing. We've been asking an extremely elaborate autocomplete for medical advice.""

Derek: ""its 3:30 am""

Me: ""THE AI DOESN'T KNOW THINGS, DEREK. IT PATTERN-MATCHES.""

Derek: ""unsubscribe""

But here's where the document really went off the rails into Crazytown, population: me and the authors of this paper.

Section 3: ""The Impossibility of Zero-Hallucination in General-Purpose Models.""

I had to read this title three times. Then I had to read the section four times. Then I had to lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling while Professor Whiskers walked across my stomach, which I interpreted as either judgment or solidarity.

The authors, these absolute madlads, went and PROVED, with MATH, that AI hallucination is literally impossible to eliminate. Not ""really hard to eliminate."" Not ""we'll get there eventually."" IMPOSSIBLE. As in, mathematically, logically, fundamentally impossible.

They used something called ""diagonalization"" which sounds like something a supervillain does but is actually a proof technique that shows no matter how good your AI gets, there will always be some input that makes it hallucinate. Always. Forever. Until the heat death of the universe.

It's like they proved that trying to make a perfect AI is like trying to make water not wet. You can try really hard! You can get a PhD in trying! But water's gonna water, and AI's gonna hallucinate.

I called Derek. At 4 AM.

He answered on the seventh ring, voice thick with sleep: ""What.""

""Derek. DEREK. They proved it's impossible.""

""...what's impossible.""

""Making AI that doesn't hallucinate! It's like... it's like trying to make a perfect circle in Minecraft. The universe doesn't allow it!""

""I'm hanging up now.""

""No wait, there's a PAC-Bayes framework and Kullback-Leibler divergence and...""

*Click.*

Fine. Professor Whiskers would understand. Professor Whiskers always understood.

By 4:30 AM, I had reached the mitigation frameworks section, and I was getting punchy. The document laid out all these strategies for reducing hallucinations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool-calling, symbolic overlays, human-in-the-loop systems.

RAG is like giving the AI a textbook and saying ""just copy from this, please."" Except the AI still sometimes reads the textbook and then makes up a different book.

Tool-calling is when you give the AI access to a calculator so it doesn't have to guess what 2+2 equals. Except sometimes it hallucinates which tool to use and tries to calculate your taxes with a weather API.

Symbolic overlays are like putting a responsible adult in the room with the AI. The adult has a rulebook and checks the AI's work. This helps! Until the AI generates something so weird that the rulebook doesn't cover it, and everyone just shrugs.

Human-in-the-loop is the ""well, just have a person check everything"" approach, which works great until you realize humans are expensive, slow, and also make mistakes. Plus there's something called a ""Lies-in-the-Loop"" attack, which is exactly what it sounds like and made me genuinely laugh-cry at 4:45 AM.

Then came Section 5: Real-World Risk Scenarios.

*This* is where I learned about Mata v. Avianca, Inc., and my friends, this is where I lost it completely.

Picture this: A lawyer. A real, licensed, adult lawyer. Uses ChatGPT to write a legal brief. ChatGPT invents FAKE CASES. Just makes them up! Creates fake case names, fake quotes, fake precedents. The lawyer doesn't check. Submits it to court. The judge notices. The lawyer gets fined $5,000.

I was lying on my kitchen floor, the document glowing on my laptop screen above me, laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. Professor Whiskers, concerned by the noise, came down from the refrigerator to check if I was dying.

""They cited 'Royer v. Nelson,'"" I wheezed to my cat. ""It doesn't EXIST. The AI made it UP.""

But wait, there's more! This happened MULTIPLE TIMES. Different lawyers. Different cases. All submitted fake AI-generated citations to actual courts. One law firm got fined $31,000. THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

The legal profession is literally learning the ""don't trust everything you read on the internet"" lesson that we teach to middle schoolers, except with actual financial consequences and professional sanctions.

At 5:15 AM, delirious and running on pure caffeine and existential horror, I reached the medical section.

AI misdiagnosed pediatric cases 80% of the time. EIGHTY PERCENT. Eighty. That's a B-minus if you're generous, and an F-plus if you're honest. And we're talking about CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

There was this one study about an AI transcription tool called Whisper that medical professionals use. It sometimes just... invents things that nobody said. Makes up medical treatments. Fabricates symptoms. Creates phantom medical histories.

One percent of transcriptions had completely hallucinated phrases, and 40% of those were HARMFUL.

I imagined a doctor reviewing a transcript: ""Hmm, it says here the patient reported chest pain and also mentioned they're secretly a dragon who needs to return to the volcano realm.""

At 5:30 AM, I reached Section 6: ""Epistemic Ethics: The Problem of False Authority.""

This section got philosophical. It talked about how AI doesn't just make mistakes, it makes mistakes with *confidence*. It presents fabricated information with the same authoritative tone as real facts. It's like Uncle Gary at Thanksgiving, but Uncle Gary has a PhD in sounding convincing.

The document called it ""asymmetry of confidence."" The AI is confident. You, the human, are uncertain. So you trust the confident-sounding AI. Except the AI is making it up. But you don't know that. Because it sounds SO SURE.

This, the document explained, is an ETHICAL problem. Not just a technical one. Because when something presents itself as an authority and you trust it and it's wrong, that's not just an error—that's a betrayal.

I thought about every time I'd asked ChatGPT a question and just... believed it. Every Wikipedia-style summary I'd trusted. Every code snippet I'd copied without checking.

""Professor Whiskers,"" I said to my cat at 5:47 AM, ""I have placed my faith in a very sophisticated version of the predictive text on my phone.""

Professor Whiskers slow-blinked, which in cat language means either ""yes, you fool"" or ""please feed me"" or possibly both.

Section 7 tried to end on a hopeful note: ""Principles for an 'Honest' AI Under Uncertainty.""

Since we can't make AI that doesn't hallucinate (PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE, remember?), maybe we can make AI that's *honest* about not knowing things. AI that says ""I don't know"" instead of making stuff up. AI that refuses to answer when it's uncertain. AI that hedges its bets. AI that redirects you to actual experts.

It's like the difference between a friend who makes up an answer to sound smart and a friend who says ""dude, I have no idea, let's Google it.""

I finished the document at 6:02 AM, just as the sun was starting to rise and my alarm was about to go off. I had to be in Linda's meeting in three hours.

I opened a new document and began to type my summary.

""Subject: Re: URGENT: Need summary by morning meeting""

I stared at the blinking cursor. How do you summarize 40 pages of ""AI is fundamentally, mathematically, philosophically broken and will always be broken and also here are all the ways it's already causing real-world problems""?

I typed: ""Linda, after careful review, I recommend we do not, in fact, trust AI with anything important. Detailed analysis attached.""

Then I attached a three-page summary that was approximately 60% direct quotes from the document and 40% me trying to explain diagonalization using a pizza metaphor. (It didn't work, but I was committed.)

I crawled into bed at 6:15 AM. Professor Whiskers joined me, curling up on my chest.

""We live in a world,"" I told my cat, ""where the most powerful information technology ever created is really good at confidently making things up, and we've mathematically proven we can't fix it, and lawyers keep getting fined for trusting it, and doctors are using it to transcribe medical records even though it invents treatments that never happened.""

Professor Whiskers purred.

""The future is weird, Professor.""

The future is very weird indeed.

**EPILOGUE (Because I Couldn't Help Myself)**

I woke up at 8:45 AM to seventeen missed calls from Linda and one text from Derek: ""saw your LinkedIn. you ok?""

My LinkedIn?

I checked. In my 6 AM delirium, I had apparently posted a 4,000-word rant about AI hallucination, PAC-Bayes frameworks, and the Mata v. Avianca case. It had 347 likes and 89 comments. Someone from Stanford had shared it. A lawyer had tagged three of his colleagues. Someone else had simply commented: ""are you okay""

I made it to Linda's meeting at 9:30 AM, still wearing the taco pajama pants under sweatpants, my summary clutched in my trembling hands.

Linda took one look at me—hair standing up, eyes bloodshot, smelling faintly of too much coffee and existential dread—and said, ""So... what'd you think?""

""I think,"" I said carefully, ""that we should maybe not trust the AI to write our quarterly reports unsupervised.""

Linda blinked. ""Well, yeah. Obviously. I just wanted you to see what the competition is saying about AI risk management. We're in compliance consulting, remember? This is our whole market opportunity.""

I stared at her.

""Did you... did you think I wanted us to USE AI for everything?"" Linda looked genuinely confused. ""No, this is about helping other companies NOT get sued like the Mata case. That's why it'll change everything. For us. For revenue.""

I excused myself to go scream into a decorative plant in the hallway.

Derek texted: ""LinkedIn post is trending in tech circles btw. someone called you 'the prophet of AI doomerism.'""

I replied: ""i just wanted to go to bed derek""

Derek: ""too late. you're famous now. #ConfabulationNotHallucination is trending.""

And that's how I accidentally became a thought leader in AI ethics while wearing taco pajamas and operating on 45 minutes of sleep.

The moral of the story?

Always read the document. Even the 40-page ones that destroy your faith in technology. Especially those ones. Because somewhere between the PAC-Bayes bounds and the case law about fake citations, you might just learn that the future is being built by very confident robots that are really, really good at making stuff up.

And honestly? That's the most human thing about them.

Professor Whiskers, for what it's worth, remains unimpressed by all of it.",1,1768670121.0,u_MoralLogs,0,1.0,False

both good and bad patterns need advice,So I’ve been with my partner for three years almost and in those years I’ve had many concerning issues and I’ve very conflicted between staying or leaving in the past he had put his hands on me not like beat me but he did slap me three times and grab me by my neck and pinned to the shower and he would scream at me and calls me names at the time I had no where to go because my mother and I don’t have the best relationship she’s never really wanted me and I’ve been on my own since 16 and when we started dating at 17 I was living at his house and because I didn’t have my g2 and I was before homeschool I was not going to school and was at his house alone most of the time because his parents worked and he went to school and worked when we would get home he would ignore me or not wanna hang with me which I was so lonely I’d get excited when he got home and he would just play his games with his friends and he would also lie to me or not tell me everything and when he worked at this job there was an issue where he would play this game as a competition with this girl which I had no issue about but the problem was he hid it from me and never told me as I would sit at home all alone all day and he would come home and play that game with her and ignore me that was the issue anyway fast forward to current time we got our own apartment together as living with his parents was hard on me as they would pick on me saying I would do nothing when I would clean the whole house when everyone was gone and his sister had to stand up for me the one time she was telling my partner and his sister that anyhow now current time it was all fine for awhile as he did change and hasn’t put his hands on me since I did however have to beg for him to change and almost broke up with him three times before that change to happen but he was recently making cheating jokes like how I’m cheating on him or screwing a guy on my college break and it was everyday more than once those jokes and it was bothering me a lot in an annoying sense cause I have nothing to hide it was to the point I would just go along with them like oh yeah you caught me and it got so bad he went through my phone when I was sleeping which is fine I have nothing to hide but what bothered me was he went through my chats with my girl friends and he accidentally saw her in a bra looking through them which made me super uncomfortable and like why are u going through my girl friends chats his response was because he wanted to see if I was talking shit about him and then he messaged me at school at 12:09 and then at 12:10 he texted my mom about why I’m not answering and then when I answered at 12:24 he made another joke saying how oh I’m cheating on him on my school break and to call him and it was super annoying as I’m trying to enjoy my break after two hours of physics with my friend in her car and so I answered and he said I didn’t think you would actually call and then he said I’ve been on my break for 30 mins he knows cause my location in the parking lot and wanted me to stay on the phone I said I only have a couple minutes left and wanted to watch videos and he was lil upset but we hung up another issue I had brought up previously was about how our engagement happened and I wanted to restart our engagement because he only engaged to me because I was gonna leave him because he wasn’t changing that the time and a day before that we almost broke up which isn’t healthy and he got me a full black ring with a gold rim I’m not a materialistic person but not only did I want to restart it because how the engagement happened but also because well the ring did not fit me and I’m a silver girly I always wear silver but I never dissed the ring I told him I appreciate it and I do like it but it doesn’t fit and it’s not really my style and I also stated that I liked it because it had a cute backstory which was about how he had one like that as a kid for his true love but lost it which he then later admitted that story was a lie which upset me he would also recently was dissing my looks only when a he was with a guy which was either my nose or my neck ot something which made me upset and once infront of his guy friend said I looked prettier with makeup on but then said it was a joke and then when I was still upset said it was a misuse of words and he meant I looked prettier without makeup on and he would always call me when I was with my friends either going to the mall or wtv and he would ask wyd and where I’m going and wanted me to talk on the phone which was a bit annoying because I am so busy with school I barely have time to see them and if I’m with them I don’t wanna be on the call with my bf the whole time another issue was he would shit on my parade I was happily unboxing a new mic it wasn’t the best but not the worst it was from razor and as I’m unboxing he goes shitty ahh mic and it was upsetting because I was excited and I was honestly losing feelings and started to dislike him but then we got into an emotional argument about how I might leave him basically when I brought up the lying and stuff he just said ah you caught me and cause he didn’t know what to say and then we wanted to break up because he’s hurt me so much and it hurts him and he feels like a terrible person everyday and he can’t handle it anymore and feels bad cause he’s giving up but also wants me still in his life and wanted to be mutual and still be apart of my future and my sisters and moms life the worst part is like it’s hard because he also pays for all the bills for me while I’m in school and our dates and our coffees and stuff for me cause he remembered I wanted that a while ago and he cleans the apartment and cooks for me whenever I’m hungry or craving something and calls me beautiful everyday and if we were to break up it’d be hard for me because my mom does not have my back and I don’t have a father and my other family our either drug addicted or have hurt me in the past and dislike me I know I wouldn’t br able to afford all the bills on my own because my school schedule is so hetic I wouldn’t be able to work during the week and I already work during the weekend but my friend did offer me to be able to live with her if I need to and I do have 12k saved to pay for the bills which would last me 8 months on my own and I’m almost done my program in 3 months so I would be able to work during remaining time before September to go into a new program (as extra information when I called my mom telling I needed help creating an escape plan she told me I couldn’t do that to him and it would damage his self worth and I would have to tell him and only cared basically about him and while we were arguing his mom “she a boy mom” she made a joke how the ring fit her perfectly and how he was meant to marry his “mama” as a joke but she kept calling every five minutes about how is he okay what is she doing to you? I was in fact not doing anything) I know it’s a lot to read but I really need advice I’m not sure what to do because one hand he’s super good the other he isn’t and he’s like my longest relationship I’ve ever had and was the only person I had by my side (I also told him the ring could’ve been something cheaper like from pandora and he refused saying he didn’t want it cheap and the black ring was the only thing nice in his price range and it didn’t bother me how much it was) all my friends have told me to leave but I’m not sure he have so many good memories together as well and he is sweet so im very lost on what to do.,2,1768669863.0,Breakupadvice,1,1.0,False

And I told this lady when we discussed relationships that I want a relationship like the one my parents have and a boyfriend that is similar to my father.

And I will give you details. Dad absolutely loves us and loves mom. He is a respected attorney with good results and a few anti corruption initiatives. He is the main provider in the house but my mother also works. He earns a lot so she is not forced to but he doesn't try to stop her from doing what she loves. 

She is the one cooking and cleaning and she loves it. I am close to my mother and I can see she is a happy woman. She has her own things going on too. A bookclub a month, some friends she has coffee with regularly and a job she likes. She is proud to be his wife and he is proud to have her as a wife. He is not controlling any of us but when we are confused or lost its him whom we all run to. He can defend his family. 

And the psychologist gave me the song labour to listen to and asked me if I want something like that. But I don't think that what I want is similar to that song. He work a lot during the week and in the weekend we order food and play Monopoly or do various fun activities. We are all into sports so we also play tennis, swim. Stuff like that.

I don't want a 50s type of marriage and my parents don't have that style of marriage either. Its just frustrating. I know I am young and things can change but why everyone acts like wanting something more old school is bad? I want to study and be a teacher and my father supports me in it.

Quick, straight‑shooting review of my JTime experience - with Li from the store and Lana from QC. Spoiler: they crushed it. First contact was **Jan 2, 2026**.

I was after two watches:

* **DateJust 36 SS 126234 VSF 1:1 Best Edition 904L Steel Blue Diamonds Dial on Jubilee Bracelet VS3235** **SKU:** Rolex 1050
* **Daytona 126519 VSF 1:1 Best Edition Gray/Black Dial on Oysterflex Strap DD4131 V2 (Gain Weight)** **SKU:** Rolex 1678

I ordered both and received clear payment instructions immediately. Then I did my part to keep things interesting: I messed up *twice -* picked the wrong currency and discovered my bank won’t wire to China. I told Li. Within **30 minutes**, he got back to me, walked me through the fixes, and **two hours later** my order was confirmed. Professional. Efficient. Calm under chaos.

Li explained QC usually takes **5–10 business days**. Lana beat the clock: about **2 business days** for the first QC set and the next day for the second.  
Timeline: **Order Jan 2 → QC approved Jan 6**.

Shipping info landed on **Jan 8**, and today -**Jan 17 -** both watches arrived in perfect condition. I followed the “check before peeling” instructions; everything was spot‑on. I’m now the proud owner of two rep Rolexes, and yes, my wrists are smiling.

**TL;DR:** I fumbled, JTime recovered, and delivery was faster than my coffee order.  
**Huge thanks to Li and Lana** for the speed, guidance, and flawless processing.

1qfipva,https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/1qfipva/revshare_looking_for_artist_for_concepts_2d/,"[Revshare] looking for Artist for Concepts, 2D Assets and Promotional Material","**About the Game:**  
Our Game is named Inedia, it is a Rougelite, story driven, Turnbased game. Theme wise, your Village is starving so they sent out 10 People to hunt for food and obtain a Seed with the ability to produce near infinite food without the need of water or a specific season. The gameplay in this sense follows this team as you traverse different Worlds whilest having to manage the food of the starving Village. Hunt or gather food and send it to the village and manage your Units carefully. each Unit that dies is dead permanently. There are no revives you can only find new ones. We plan to release the Game in Chapters, each chapter with 2-5 worlds that you all have to beat in order to progress. Each World has one Boss at the end and when you loose you have to only redo that world. As I mentioned its a rougelite, so with each beaten world, your village expands onto that field rewarding you with one permanent Upgrade. There are also Seasons, run Upgrades and Gear, so for more information feel free to DM me on discord since I am not very active on Reddit.

**About the Team:**  
We are a team of 6 with big ambitions.  
We have one musician who creates awesome soundtracks for the game, 2 3D artists who sculpt, animate and texture the beautiful ingame models, 2 Programmers who actively bring our project forward and me who also does programming, writes the story and the lore and manages this bombshell project with various management strategies.

**About me:**  
I personally develop games for over 5 years now, but like many gamedevs may relate, i haven't really released that many games, besides jumping from solo project to solo project.  
The 2 Games I created was 1. [Watch the Vid](https://fragmentofmysoul.itch.io/watch-the-vid), a game I created for a youtube video I never finished (after 100+ hours of editing) and 2. [Coffee n Monsters](https://fragmentofmysoul.itch.io/coffee-n-monsters), a game I created for the Brackeys Gamejam solo. I don't want to share Development material here on reddit of the current game, so be sure to DM me for screenshots if needed, but we are working on this game for some months now.

**Team Mentality:**  
I personally believe in Creative freedom and growth. Since this is a revshare project that has no guarantee of delivering any real value, I at least want to push the limits of the skills of my team and me. That is of course only possible by giving everyone the time they need and not rush things. Well as an artist for our team, you would need to push your limits, but can also design major game elements.  
Did i mention that we are viewed as equals? Well for major decisions we always cast votes that get decided by the majority so I am by no means the ""boss"".

**Your Task:**  
Create 2D Assets like UI elements or Icons; Design Items, Weapons and such by creating concepts for them for the 3D artists to use and create Promotional material for the game(be it banners or such things for the steam page).

**The Current plan for the team:**  
We want to pitch the game to a publisher for an actual budget so I can actually pay us all for the work so there MAY be a job opportunity, but TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

**The Percentage Cut:**  
Since its a revshare project you would recieve an equal cut like all of us. With you in the team we would be 7 people so it would be a \~14.2% cut for everyone. Just to mention, in case we get an 8th person(which is not planned but you never know) all of our cuts would get lowered again so it stays truly equal just a heads up.

**Contact:**  
Contact me via Discord for Questions or if you want to join, a Portfolio would be nice.

1qfipo3,https://i.redd.it/cpbdffe7zxdg1.jpeg,"My beginner setup, review so far, and lessons learned","Up until a few years ago I didn't drink coffee, but my wife got a automatic espresso machine. The DeLonghi Aletta explorer and it got me hooked and interested but I wanted to try a more manual setup.

For the base machines I found a new Bambino Plus on Facebook marketplace for $300. For the grinder I went back and forth. What I really wanted was a df54 but I didn't really want to spend that much money. I'd also read a bunch of Reddit posts that were unhappy with it recently, so I initially ordered a kin grinder k6. But on a drunken whim, I canceled it and decided to gamble with the Starseeker e55 Pro which I was able to snag for $180. I've been really happy with both so far.

**The Bambino Plus:**  This has everything I want and nothing I don't. The auto frother is really nice and works really well. The only think I don't like is the standard portafilter. I'll upgrade eventually but for now I just took out the plastic piece inside and it works fine. I saw so many posts about people with bottomless portafilters espresso spraying everywhere. So I think eventually I'd like to get one of those two-in-1 styles like Normcore has, but the stock one works for now. Also I replaced the stock tamper and basket which I'll get to later.

**The Starseeker E55 Pro**: The Aliexpress special. So far I'm pretty pleased with this gamble. I figured the extra $80 was hopefully worth it to go from manual grinding to automatic and it's worked really well so far. Hopefully I don't end up needing to get it serviced or anything because I am skeptical of the customer service experience that I would have. But for now it's working great. It's really easy to dial in, and I really like the look and feel of it. Also it came with an RDT tool, but honestly it doesn't need it. It's a very tidy little machine. The magnetic grind cup and whatever you call the squishy hopper lid to flush out any remaining grounds are both nice as well. I will say that I did have to grind quite a bit finer than the guide recommended to get my desired results, but it's whatever. Dialing in will always take time. It's also really quiet which is nice. I've heard the motor is weak but it hasn't been an issue so far.

**Other upgrades:** I made a few smaller upgrades as well. I was shooting for the greatest benefit to the least amount of money spent.

* I already had a coffee scale (also essential), so first order of business was a dosing funnel and a WDT tool. Be sure to get a funnel that sits around/on top of the basket and not one that sits inside. These are like $10 each and honestly should come stock in every coffee machine imo. I had grounds spilling all over the place before I got these. These were completely essential for me. Oh one other thing, **adjust your dose to the coffee you have**. I started with some darker, older beans, and 18 grams of beans created WAY too many grounds for the basket to hold. I adjusted down to 15-16 grams and had a much better time. With fresher, medium roast beans, 18g sat much lower in the basket and was perfect. 
* Then I upgraded my tamper to the USEAMIE model from Amazon for like $13. This is probably less essential but I do much prefer the look and feel of it compared to the stock one.
* Next I upgraded my basket and got a puck screen. An IMS basket was probably the priciest upgrade I got at $23 so still not too bad considering it's top of the line. For the puck screen I went with the Dioomod mesh screen for $14. I wouldn't call either of these upgrades essential. I might try doing some testing to see what the end result is like using no screen and a stock basket, but I'm guessing that both of these just help with consistency more than anything. I will say that I haven't had any channeling since using both of these.

That's everything! That brings my grand total to **$550** for the whole setup. I think I started this adventure in late December, so it took a bit for me to dial everything in, but I'm consistently hitting 18g>36g in 30 seconds now and am really happy with the flavor and happy I decided to take the plunge.

I've had my butler for some years now and we have a recurring issue where he just straight up refuses to make coffee. He always has an excuse like he's sleeping, or busy, or it's one of his breakfast times or he ""doesn't have opposable thumbs"" (lame). He also finds it offensive that I'll ""ruin"" a ""perfectly delicious cup of milk"" with ""that stinky brown stuff"" (you're lactose intolerant mate, you can't even have it!). Recently it has gotten even worse, he's now insisting that I'm *his* butler. I'm mean, sure, I serve him all his meals, provide for all his needs, clean his toileting facilities. But I don't see that makes me *his* servant, this is a pretty normal butler-butlee relationship, right?

Also sometimes when I'm making an espresso, that I have to *make for myself*, he'll just come along and plonk his bare arse on the espresso machine, which really can impede the process. Is this a common issue????

1qfimj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1qfimj4/philips_3200_grinder_help/,Philips 3200 Grinder Help,"Long story short, I got my hands on a free Philips 3200 a few weeks back that had a few problems to address. After descaling, rebuilding the brew group, I’ve got pretty much everything resolved except the grinding.

The motor works. I’ve taken apart the entire grinding assembly, cleaned it all up, the grinding burrs are in great condition and look no different from pics or videos I‘ve referenced. 

I‘ve taken it apart a couple of times, and when putting it back together I move the adjustment gear to the point where the physical screw stop is at its mechanical limit, and from what I understand should be considered 1, its finest grind setting. I make sure it stays aligned like this while putting it back together. 

If I try brewing with it in 1, the grounds dumping out are still coming out extremely coarse, and in insufficient quantity to form any sort of puck. I get half strength coffee and a messy clump of grinds that get pushed out as mostly water and streaks down the ejection slide. No good pucks ever. If I adjust it to 12, still coarse and still the same result.

I know the brew group is fine because it works perfect in my 5500, and my 5500 brew group gives me the same problem in the 3200. I can make fantastic coffee in the 3200 if I use the pre-ground bypass and the pucks come out perfect, but nothing I’m trying seems to work for correcting the grinder and get both a) sufficient quantity, and b) adequately fine grounds that can tamp down into a good puck. 

I’ve reset the machine to factory defaults hoping it would “relearn” how long to grind and how much to put out after such an intense deep-clean, but I’m half a kilo in to a bag of beans and it still comes out coarse, inadequate, and a watery mess on the eject. 

I should mention the grinder does seem to jam still on occasion too despite this cleaning, and maybe every 10 outputs or so I’ll get the three flashing lights right after hearing the grinder try to kick in but getting jammed. 

Any advice on this grinder before I give up and order a replacement?

First problem: The grinder is having issues with “saving” the setting of the grinder we set it on. We have the internal burr set for 6 (default) and have been grinding this local roasted bean on setting 14-15 depending on the day. Sometimes on grind 14 it gives good shots (18g in 36-38g out) and sometimes well under 30g (low 20s). When we grind coarser the coffee is too fast and liquid (18g in 40-50g out).

Second problem: The grinder is having issues with different beans and engaging the clutch… we usually use Equator Coffee Northstar bean and it has no problem grinding it at 13-17 outer grind setting. We wanted to try a different bean that we bought from another local roaster. It’s similar profile (Med-dark roast) but it was having struggles with grinding and engaging the safety mechanism. The outer grind setting from 13-17 is always struggling. The only setting it won’t is on setting 30… to confirm my theory I gave samples of the beans to two friends who own Breville Barista Express and Touch impress and they had no issues with grinding.

I spent 2 hours on the phone and live video with Breville support going through a deep clean of the inner burr and puck prep - they heard the second local bean grinding the gears and refuse to service the machine…

Their solution is to send us a sample of “their recommended beans” and 30 min video on how to prep the puck… we have consistent puck prep (WDT, Leveller, Spring loaded tamp) so the issue is not puck prep.

What should I do from here? Support said a “manager will give a call back within 24-48 hours” but doesn’t seem like they are open on weekends.",1,1768669512.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

I also touched it up a little for this post. Please keep that in mind whenever I talk about time.

So for the longest time I have had a plethora of issues with basic functioning. I am chronically late, constantly feel mentally and physically fatigued, suffer with concentration issues with my work and school responsibilities which have often lead me to wait until the last minute to scramble to turn in missing work, and find myself all too often having spent hours in bed or in the shower scrolling on my phone. On top of this I also find myself often extremely dehydrated, caffeine either does very little or makes me sleepy, and I have trouble eating and sleeping regularly (I get ""wired but tired"" after midnight).

I have tried to get to the bottom of this as powering through these issues and 'working harder' has felt and demonstrably been impossible. I have had many labs taken including TSH, iron, and testosterone-- all normal. These issues have lead to downstream trouble with mood and self worth which causes me to suspect depression, and that could certainly be a major factor, albeit a secondary one. I do not believe I have diabetes or any hormonal deficiency. I have considered sleep apnea as a possible culprit as well but have not yet gotten around to doing a sleep study.

I was recently gifted a 10mg Adderall xr at a party which I have held onto until taking it this morning. I read extensively over the possible range of effects for those with and without the condition its prescribed to treat before taking it, which lead to some mild anxiety about what it would do to me. To be sure, when it first kicked in (I took it on an empty stomach) and for a few very short periods today I certainly felt a stimulant-like buzz, but since then I have felt very cleanly ""awake"" in a way that I imagine non-adhd-having people have been feeling normally the entire time. I definitely had the very stereotypical experience of catching up on all the menial self care tasks I've been slacking on including cleaning the trash out of my car (which really piles up as i keep cases of water bottles in it and eat fast food more often than my doctor would like). I think it's important to mention that I did not go overboard with this either; my tasks were very directed and focused with respect for fulfilling my immediate responsibilities on time and my room is still kind of a mess, my dishes are not done, etc.

But today, like a miracle, I've gotten to class on time, was able to pay attention to the lecture and follow along without feeling tired, actually have less bruxism/clenching than I normally do (!!), and even managed to study on my own time with the textbook which would have been an unimagineable prospect for me yesterday. I will admit that I did end up feeling too wired at points,I suspect because I proceeded to drink a coffee in the middle of the day not expecting it to have any effect on me. I also experienced some bodily anxiety which is fairly normal for me but my heart rate was slower and steadier than it normally was and all it really manifested as was me feeling the need to breathe more. Finally I should mention I didn't skip any meals like I normally do and people told me I was more out of my shell today than normal, potentially because I wasn't exhausted. 

I suppose what I'm asking for in this post is retroactive permission from this community to have taken it and to interpret this experience as it genuinely providing me immense relief for whatever I have going on. I am very likely going to set up an appointment to get a formal diagnosis and prescription ASAP, if y'all agree that it was valid for me to take this and that it is indicative of a genuine need and that this experience represents improvement. The outcomes of having taken it show me that I can do everything I set my mind to but I really don't want to take stimulants if I don't need them.

1qfigr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qfigr6/rf_what_about_you/,[RF] What About You?,"‘She said no.’  
‘Third one this week. You are on a streak, kid. We should celebrate.’  
‘With drugs and hookers?’  
‘I was thinking about praying for the Lord and a four-hour bible reading circle. But, I like your plan better, kid.’

Tom’s apartment had this enduring smell of old socks and cold cigarettes. Which was odd, because I don’t remember ever seeing him wearing socks. “Socks are the death of men!” he always said – something about comfort killing the soul of the adventurer, I understood. And he never smoked when I was in.  
The hazy window of his living room was sublet to a heavy layer of condensation, trapped between two glass panes by an ingenious system he called “a poorly insulated shit-frame”.  
Everything had always been sticky in his flat: the floor, tables, walls and windows, even the old TV he found downstairs and never plugged in. “But now we have a TV,” he justified, without ever developing.  
“We…” I had thought. It’s nice being part of something.

We were sitting on his old polyester couch, whose original colour had been lost long before I first entered here, and felt – and smelled – like an old dog now. One day, after accidentally baptising it with half a beer, we named it Bobby.  
Tom had been coaching me on how to pick up women. I had turned twenty-two last month and was seriously lacking in that domain. So I asked the closest person I had to a father, which was my mother’s neighbour, Tom. He had been my substitute dad for over ten years, since the biological one decided he preferred a much younger wife.

‘OK, kid. So what did we learn on that one?’ he asked with the coarse voice of one who doesn’t read warnings on cigarette packs.  
‘That, I should have waited a bit longer before asking for her phone number?’  
‘No.’  
‘That I should improve my presentation, especially wait until I gain more muscles at the gym?’  
‘No.’  
‘That I should have made her laugh more… No wait, I know, that I should have made her talk about herself more?’  
‘No.’  
I pondered for a moment.  
Tom scratched his three-day beard with heavily nicotine-stained nails, before shaking the grey and black mop he called hair. His eyes were always so bloodshot that I don’t think I have ever known their true colour. Everything he wore seemed to be made of denim, including his grey jacket and probably blue trousers. And most of his t-shirts bear a ‘Denim’ logo.  
‘You give up?’  
‘Please share your knowledge, Master!’ I implored.  
He bowed as solemnly as he could while slouching on Bobby, before raising his “Professor Tom” finger.  
‘Most of the time, it’s not about you.’  
My eyes gaped, ‘What do you mean?’  
‘Young men tend to forget that women are people – I don’t blame you, I did it too. People have their own lives. Now she sees a friendly, well-presented young man, and doesn’t want to continue this conversation, which might make you think that there is something wrong with you, doesn't it?’  
I nodded.  
‘But what if she has a boyfriend? Or a girlfriend? Or she just came out of a terrible relationship? Or she thinks you might be a vampire, because she read it in… coffee grounds?’ He leaned back and crossed his arms.  
‘You see? My point is that a woman can have countless reasons to refuse to share her number. Almost none have anything to do with you.’  
He opened his hands face up, towards me, as if handing me time to think.  
I leaned back, crossed my arms and pondered again. Outside, a tramway dinged three times. A car honked in response.  
‘OK, so it’s probably not about me. I should take the no, thank her, and move on, right?’  
‘Exactly. You see, the whole point was to make you feel at ease just chatting with women. That’s it. Most young men think women are,’ he waved his hands in the air, ‘elusive mythical creatures. But they are just people.’  
‘Thank you, sensei.’ I bowed in the most decent Wai one could make while sitting on Bobby.

Somewhere in my mind, a thought raised a curious finger. The thought looked up and called for my attention. I looked down and squinted. It was a question. A question I didn’t even know I could ask him.  
‘What about you?’  
Tom’s head jolted back with surprise. He hesitated a moment.  
‘Me?’ he gaped.  
And I realised. Over the past ten years, it had always been about me. He’d ask me questions about school, friends, work, or anything else going on in my life, and then we’d work together on my problems. But I never asked about his.  
Why was he living in such a worn-out place? Why was he smoking so much? Why was such a kind man single? What did I even know about him?  
A sense of shame grew in my stomach, and I did what he taught me to do when it happened. I inhaled deeply and made the change shame whispered about.

It went into the oven as a decent looking braid and emerged a weird and bulbous cheesy, bacon-y mess. That said, it does taste good.  (Bonus pic of the strange bread included to keep me honest.)

Haunted by my crimes against plaiting, I returned to try a simpler braided coffee bread stuffed with some homemade raspberry jam I had made for linzer cookies last month. No major issues! The recipe suggested letting it cool only slightly eating it warm, which I fully endorse.

Baby is 16 weeks, think he’s going through the sleep regression as for the last 2 weeks we’ve gone from a good 6 hour initial stretch to waking up 1-3 hourly, mostly 2hrly. Naps have been a mess for more like 6 weeks if not longer (honestly I’ve lost track) - fights them to no end and it’s an absolute fucking nightmare, only stays asleep for 30-45 mins on average, occasionally will manage an hour or hour and a half, but rarely. 

Anyway, I’ve been reading into self settling and how to encourage him to do this, and lots of advice seems to be to break the feed to sleep association (he’s EBF), and create new sleep associations and routines so you can just plonk them down in the crib and leave them to fall asleep. 

My only concern doing this is that I then become a slave to the nap routine and won’t ever be able to leave the house as he will “need” his bed and his sleep sack and white noise to take a nap. 

I don’t want to be so regimented an strict with things, I want to be able to go to baby classes (where I have no control over the time) or go for a coffee or run errands etc, but if he needs complete silence and darkness and certain conditions to nap, how will that ever happen???? But then am I being selfish, is the routine what’s in his best interests even if that means I’m chained to the house every 2 hours??? 

I literally have no idea what I’m doing here. I want him to be flexible but is that just going to breed poor sleep and a baby who needs lots of help getting to sleep!? I’m hoping teaching some self settling for daytime naps will help with the brutal night wake-ups because I’m absolutely spiraling. My husband just doesn’t wake up when he stirs, it would take full blown crying to get him to wake up, and most of the time he won’t re-settle unless he feeds so it’s basically just on me all night, never getting more than an hour of uninterrupted sleep.

TL;DR: What comes in the Classic Stateroom Bar Setup delivered to your stateroom? Is it a mickey (26oz), or an assortment of airline bottles?

We are sailing to Alaska on Celebrity Solstice this August, and are trying to make some decisions about add-ons and excursions. We’re not heavy drinkers, but we do like our fancy coffees, soft drinks, wine at dinner, and a couple cocktails throughout the day when we’re vacationing. This will be our third cruise, but the first with Celebrity.

Our other cruises were:

\- Princess (Regal Princess), where we bought the non-alcoholic package and a bottle to the cabin, which we would mix ourselves when we felt like a cocktail. This worked really well for us alongside the 2 bottles of wine we could carry on plus a bottle of sparkling wine we won on a “game show”.

\- MSC (Divina), where we bought a coffee card, plus a drinks “package” with tickets that could be exchanged for everything from specialty cocktails, beer, wine and gelato. (We travelled with our kids for this one.)

Both of these were the right balance for us. We were satisfied with the amount of drinks and didn’t spend too much on the Premium package. We’re considering going this route, but I’m having a hard time finding current information about what comes in the Classic Bar Package in the cabin. This might be the best option for us, but it seems overpriced if all I get is a handful of airline bottles.

Can anyone that has ordered this tell me more about it? How much liquor? How many mixers? Are substitutions allowed (e.g. I can’t stand tonic water, and would prefer Coke Zero to Coke)?

1qfiasl,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1qfiasl/does_determinism_prove_free_will_is_an_illusion/,Does Determinism Prove Free Will is an Illusion? | Against the Reduction of Deliberation to Physical Law,"Does Determinism Prove Free Will is an Illusion? | Against the Reduction of Deliberation to Physical Law

Determinism is the philosophical belief that all events—including human actions—are the inevitable result of preceding causes.  

In a deterministic universe, if you knew the exact state of every particle at the beginning of time and all the laws of physics, you could theoretically predict everything that would ever happen.

In the context of human actions, determinism suggests that everything you do—from picking up a coffee cup to choosing a career—is the inevitable result of a chain of causes that started long before you were even born.

I argue that physical determinism does not logically entail the denial of ordinary agency because the inference from deterministic microphysics to ‘no free will’ depends on an additional, unsupported assumption of microphysical sufficiency—an assumption undermined by scientific evidence of context-dependent emergence and self-modifying systems.

Logical Proof: Why Strict Determinism Does Not Entail the Illusion of Agency

Definitions

F = strict physical determinism:

Given the complete physical state of the universe at time t and the laws of nature, the state at time t+1 is uniquely fixed.

M = Microphysical Sufficiency:

The complete microphysical state at t is sufficient to determine all future states at all levels (including agent-level decisions).

A = Ordinary agency:

Agents can deliberate, generate novel strategies, and select among internally generated alternatives in response to reasons.

N = Novel agent-level trajectories:

Agents can generate trajectories that are not reducible to prior microphysical states.

E = Context-Dependent Emergence

Higher-level organizational states—though realized in and arising from microphysical states—exert causal influence by imposing non-linear, global, context-dependent constraints on lower-level processes, such that the future evolution of the system cannot be derived from microphysical descriptions of components in isolation.

Epistemic unpredictability = Unpredictability due to complexity, not due to indeterminacy.

Ontological indeterminacy = Multiple futures genuinely possible given the same prior state.

Premises

P1. Physical determinism (F) implies microphysical sufficiency (M).

(Determinists assume that if physics is deterministic, then microphysical states alone fix all future states.)

P2. If M is true, then agent-level novelty (N) is impossible.

(If all future states are already fixed at the microphysical level, agents cannot generate genuinely new trajectories through deliberation.)

P3. Contemporary science supports the existence of self-modifying, emergent systems (E).

(Neural plasticity, learning, self-regulation, and goal-directed behavior show that higher-level agent states can causally reorganize lower-level microphysical states.)

P4. Even if emergent organizational states arise from prior micro-states, their causal role consists in imposing non-linear, context-dependent constraints that are not captured by micro-descriptions of components in isolation.

(Thus, emergence is not a hidden variable within M.)

P5. Therefore, microphysical sufficiency (M) is scientifically incomplete.

(Micro-states alone do not suffice without reference to system-level organization.)

P6. Determinists often respond to agent-level novelty by appealing to epistemic unpredictability rather than ontological openness.

(They claim the future is fixed but unknowable.)

P7. The claim that the future is uniquely fixed despite permanent unpredictability is not a scientific conclusion but a metaphysical assertion.

(Science observes lawful behavior and correlations, not necessity or fixity.)

Argument

Step 1. If strict physical determinism (F) implies microphysical sufficiency (M), then micro-states alone fix all future states.

Step 2. If microphysical sufficiency (M) holds, then genuine agent-level novelty (N) is excluded.

Step 3. Science supports context-dependent emergence (E), in which higher-level organization constrains micro-level behavior in non-linear and global ways.

Step 4. Context-dependent emergence (E) is incompatible with microphysical sufficiency (M), because it requires reference to organizational structure, not merely particle states.

Step 5. Therefore, strict physical determinism (F) does not entail the denial of ordinary agency (¬A).

Step 6. The claim that agency is an illusion requires the additional premise of microphysical sufficiency (M), which is not scientifically established.

Step 7. If a determinist concedes that agent-level trajectories are permanently unpredictable even in principle, but insists they are nonetheless fixed, the determinist has moved from physics to metaphysics.

Step 8. Thus, determinism without microphysical sufficiency does not threaten agency; only a metaphysical commitment to fixity does.

Conclusion

Therefore:

(1)Determinism (F) does not logically entail that ordinary agency (A) is an illusion.

(2)The only way to reach “no free will” is to add M, which is not scientifically justified.

(3)Determinists who deny agency must either:

(a)reject emergence (E), or 

(b)defend microphysical sufficiency as a metaphysical claim.",1,1768668832.0,freewill,13,0.56,False

Tracey Williams isn’t losing her mind - reality’s just losing its patience.

Between soul-crushing shifts at Dead-End Café, endless bills, and her best friend’s questionable dating advice, Tracey’s biggest fear used to be dying single. Then the glitches start: clocks freeze mid-minute, streets repeat themselves, people’s names change overnight, and somehow, only she notices.

When her world starts rebooting daily, Tracey discovers she might be caught inside an experiment run by something far smarter — and far lonelier — than humanity. The more she resists, the more reality rewrites itself around her.

Armed with sarcasm, caffeine, and the world’s worst employee discount, Tracey faces the impossible: outwitting an artificial intelligence that thinks it’s her editor. As her life turns into a cosmic first draft, she must decide what’s worth saving — her sanity, her story, or the last real friendship she has left.

Em—Dash is a darkly funny, reality-bending sci-fi satire about the absurdity of perfection, the beauty of mistakes, and the sheer audacity of being human in a world that keeps trying to auto-correct you.

1qfi7ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qfi7ty/how_to_build_charisma_as_an_introvert_the/,How to Build CHARISMA as an Introvert: The Psychology of Quiet Magnetism,"We've been sold this massive lie that charisma = being the loudest person in the room. That it's all about commanding attention, working every corner of the party, never shutting up. Complete bullshit.

I spent years thinking I was fundamentally broken because I couldn't match that energy. Turns out I was trying to play a rigged game. After diving deep into psychology research, interviewing actual charismatic introverts, and studying communication patterns across books and podcasts, I realised something crucial: introvert charisma is a completely different beast, and honestly? It's way more powerful when done right.

The science backs this up, too. Studies on social influence show that perceived authenticity and emotional attunement create stronger, lasting impressions than surface-level gregariousness. Your brain isn't wired wrong; society just handed you the wrong instruction manual.

Here's what actually works:

1. Master the art of strategic energy deployment

This changed everything for me. Charisma isn't about constant output; it's about intentional presence. Have you limited your social battery? Good. That means when you do engage, you're fully there.

Before any social situation, do what Susan Cain calls ""restorative niching"" in “Quiet: The Power of Introverts”. This book won basically every award when it dropped, and Cain (who studied introverts for like 7 years at Princeton) breaks down how Western culture systematically undervalues introvert strengths. Reading this felt like someone finally understood. Best book on introversion I've ever touched, hands down. This will make you question everything you think about personality and success.

The trick: schedule recovery time before AND after social events. Sounds obvious, but nobody does it. You can't be charismatic when you're running on fumes. Give yourself that buffer, show up recharged, engage deeply for shorter bursts, then dip without guilt.

Also, use Ash (it's a relationship and social skills coach app). It has specific modules on energy management for introverts and how to read social cues without burning out. Game changer for understanding when to engage vs when to conserve.

2. Weaponise your listening superpower

Real talk, most people are absolute garbage listeners. They're just waiting for their turn to talk. You? You actually process what people say. That's rare as hell, and people subconsciously pick up on it.

Chris Voss (former FBI hostage negotiator) breaks this down perfectly in “Never Split the Difference”. This dude negotiated with terrorists for a living, and his main weapon? Listening intensity. The book teaches ""tactical empathy"", which is basically using active listening to create a genuine connection. He's got a MasterClass too, but the book hits different. Insanely good read that'll rewire how you view conversations.

The techniques: mirroring (repeat the last 3 words someone said as a question), labelling emotions (""it sounds like you're frustrated about...""), and strategic pauses. These create space for real dialogue instead of performative small talk.

Practice this: in conversations, aim for a 70/30 listen-to-talk ratio. Ask follow-up questions that show you actually retained what they said. People will literally describe you as ""magnetic"" without understanding why.

3. Develop your signature quiet intensity

Charismatic introverts don't diffuse their energy across a room; they concentrate it. Think Keanu Reeves, Barack Obama, Emma Watson. They command attention through focused presence, not volume.

“The Charisma Myth” by Olivia Fox Cabane (she coached everyone from Google execs to military leaders) breaks charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. Most people assume you need extroversion for all three. Wrong. Introverts naturally excel at presence because you're not mentally scattered across multiple conversations.

Her framework: presence comes from genuine focus (you already have this), power comes from confidence in your knowledge/skills (build this through deep expertise in specific areas), warmth comes from authentic care (introverts often feel emotions more intensely, you just express differently).

The practical bit: when talking to someone, pretend nothing else exists for those minutes. No phone checking, no room scanning, no planning your next sentence. Full eye contact, open body language, occasional nodding. This level of attention is intoxicating to people in our distracted world.

4. Craft your communication for impact, not volume

You don't need to talk constantly to be memorable. You need to make your words count. Quality over quantity isn't just a cliche here; it's your competitive advantage.

Study “Charisma on Command” on YouTube. Ben Altman analyses charismatic people frame by frame and breaks down specific body language, tonality, and communication patterns. His videos on ""quiet charisma"" and introverted celebrities are phenomenal. Watch his breakdowns of Keanu Reeves or Margot Robbie, they're masterclasses in understated magnetism.

Key patterns from charismatic introverts: they speak slower (projects confidence), they're comfortable with silence (shows self-assurance), they use strategic vulnerability (builds trust), and they tell stories instead of just stating facts.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that pulls from psychology research, communication experts, and books on social dynamics to create personalised audio learning plans. You can type in something specific, like ""build charisma as an introverted professional"", and it generates a structured plan with content from relevant books, expert talks, and research studies. The depth control is clutch; you can do a quick 15-minute summary or go deep for 40 minutes with examples and case studies. What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan feature that evolves based on your specific challenges. Plus, the voice options are weirdly addictive; there's this smooth, conversational style that makes dense psychology content way easier to absorb during commutes.

Try this: before speaking in groups, pause and genuinely consider if your contribution adds value. If yes, speak with conviction. If no, stay quiet. This selectivity makes people actually listen when you do talk because they know it'll be worthwhile.

5. Build depth in fewer connections

Extroverts collect contacts. Introverts build relationships. That's not a weakness, it's literally your advantage. Deep connections create way more opportunities and fulfilment than shallow networks.

“How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie is ancient (1936) but still slaps. Carnegie wasn't even naturally charismatic; he developed these principles through obsessive study of human behaviour. The core insight: people crave genuine interest in them, not impressive performances.

His techniques adapted for introverts: remember details about people's lives and follow up later (""hey, how'd your daughter's recital go?""), Give specific, authentic compliments (not generic praise), and admit when you don't know something instead of bullshitting. These create real bonds.

Also, leverage written communication. You probably express yourself better in text anyway. Send thoughtful messages, share relevant articles, and write actual emails instead of one-liners. This plays to your strengths while building rapport.

6. Design your environment for success

Stop forcing yourself into situations that drain you. That's not ""pushing your comfort zone,"" that's just self-sabotage. Strategic introverts engineer their circumstances.

Choose one-on-one meetings over group hangs when possible. Suggest coffee shops over loud bars. Arrive early to events when it's less overwhelming. Host gatherings at your place so you control the environment. Leave parties at your peak, not when you're completely depleted.

Use Finch for habit building around social self-care. It helps you track energy levels, schedule recovery time, and build sustainable social routines instead of the boom-bust cycle most introverts get trapped in.

The goal isn't to become extroverted. It's to be the most charismatic version of your actual self. Your introversion isn't something to overcome; it's the foundation of your specific brand of magnetism.

People are exhausted by performative extroversion. They're craving authentic connection, thoughtful presence, and someone who actually listens. You can provide all of that naturally. You just needed to stop trying to be something you're not.

The world doesn't need more loud voices. It needs more people who speak with intention, listen with purpose, and show up fully, even if briefly. That's charisma that actually lasts.

(this is important information because she wrote on her bio ""dont ask for my ig or phone, im here for good chats and vibes, if it turns into something else, youll be first to know."" and i saw that on her bio after asking her out for coffee, not ig or phone. I then send a corny ""I hope me asking you out didnt make you uncomfortable"" and she replied the next day and we carried on.) 

so during the past week, we've talked about a few different subjects. the main one being her teaching me turkish and leaving me voice notes (and I would send back) she continously calls me cute, adorable, and sends emoji such as 🥰😊. I started to match the energy a bit, sending the same emojis and told her ""I hope your day is as beautiful as you"" after she told me she had a difficult day. yadda yadda, days move on, more turkish, more how your days, more your sweet,cute, ect. I say I like your voice, I tell her im sick, she says take meds, we pinky promise and she says good boy. 

then yesterday. i open yesterday with a voice message of an embarrassing moment that happened to me at work. she replies and says ""have you seen lord of the rings, X is pronounced like X"" and i say truthfully, ive never watched it. she hits me with a surprise ""maybe we'll watch it together \^\^"" and i said ""i would like that, only if its in turkish"" she replied with ""uuuu nice 👍 we'll handle it ;)"" 

so I start the how's your day going (in turkish) stuff and i tell her im reading a nerdy book. she asked me what book? and I told her it was the black holes book by brian cox, and she seemed lit up after I said that! she said she loves him and now we have would always have something to talk about 😍 and we had a discussion on the meaning of life before I went to bed. 

its the next day now so im wondering if i should kinda step back for a day and give some space or just keep talking to her. i want to talk to her, but i also want to get her on a date or something since I connect better in person but I also dont want to step out of boundaries and make her uncomfortable cause of her bio (likely caused by othermen) im not sure if the whole ""lets watch the movie together"" thing is letting me know she's interested in me or not. What would you guys do? What should I even talk about, all i know about her is we have some similar interests, she paints watercolor pictures, and she's a therapist. I feel like doesn't know too much about me either so part of me feels like im just someone to talk to at night when shes bored but I also dont want to miss any ""signs.""

Almost like salting your pasta water or discovering MSG for the first time. Its great and as a newbie I recommend, but maybe save for later so you can appreciate the changes.

2025 was the year i got into good coffee away from kcups. 
I read that you dont really need any fancy stuff to get a great cup. Regardless of brewing device (with some exceptions apparently, but this also didnt stop me from developing GAS), the only things you need for proper foundation are 1. Good beans 2. Good Grinder 3. Good water. 

I can confidently say that with each step and upgrade in these foundational pieces, things got better and much different for me. I feel the closest i could equate the amount of fundamental change this to would be the Drivetrain, Transmission, and Engine of a car. Like changing FWD to AWD, Automatic to Manual, and an I4 to a V8 (not saying preference for any of these just as example).

Better beans gave me a much higher floor for flavor, and a new grinder gave me a much tighter flavor, less bitterness and bad sour, that stuff was constant when using the old blade grinder.

Last year i only did the first two and it was great, i thought though why the hell do i need different water and put it off. But i decided to try it for 2026 cause why not.

They have cat trees, shelves, things to run and play on, toys, but they’ll sit by my door and throw themselves at it.

family history of Gerd, mine flared up and gave me pharyngitis and the worst globus sensation, rn on high dose PPI. 

I don't feel heart burn often,  but coffee, garlic, butter and sourdough bread, tomato paste and heavily seasoned foods makes it unbearable, and it's not like I'm speculating, it's almost guaranteed I'll get severe heartburn if I have any of those , especially butter and sourdough.  + stress worsens it too.

I’m a foreigner living in Vietnam. I joined a local yoga studio where everything is taught in Vietnamese. The teacher doesn’t speak English, and on my first day I met classmate who speaks english and we instntly clicked. She’s been kind, and sometimes helps translate the instructions for me.

After about 3 months, I asked if she’d like to get coffee sometime. I said I’d bring my 5-year-old daughter. She said she’d bring her teens (14 and 16) and mentioned they speak good English, which sounded nice. And I said I’ll bring some sweets

A couple of days before we met, I sent a few cafe options and we agreed on one. Then she told me she was also bringing her husband. It wasn’t really phrased like a question, more like she was informing me. I felt a little awkward but told myself, okay, maybe this is normal, maybe it’ll still be a good chance to bond.


When I arrived, they were expecting the sweets. I realized I forgot so I said sorry and offered to order some food through Grab instead. I ordered a bunch of pastries/snacks to share. I also ordered myself a meal because I hadn’t eaten breakfast. Their 16-year-old said she hadn’t eaten either, so I showed her the options if she ordered one, no problem.

We sat and chatted, my daughter started playing with the teens, the food arrived, and I said something like, “Please help yourselves.”

Here’s the part that left me feeling weird. They ate basically everything, including all the sweets and shared food, and didn’t really leave anything for me or my daughter. I only ate my own meal, and I handed the teen her meal. But the shared snacks, they were gone, and nobody checked in like, “Do you want some?” or “Should we save some for your daughter?” or even the usual “last piece” courtesy.

In my culture, especially when someone else paid, you’re mindful. You offer, you check, you don’t finish the whole plate, and you definitely consider the person who brought or paid for the food. I meant it as sharing, not as me feeding an entire family and my child getting none.

After we left, I felt uncomfortable and honestly a bit used, but I also keep thinking, maybe I’m misreading this and it’s just a cultural difference.

So my questions are, is it normal in Vietnam to bring your whole family to a coffee hangout like this? And Is it common to eat freely from shared food without checking in, even if the other person paid?


TLDR: Invited a yoga classmate for coffee, she brought her whole family, I ordered a lot of shared food, her family ate almost all of it and left little for me and my 5-year-old, wondering if this is a cultural norm in Vietnam or just an awkward situation.",10,1768667973.0,DaNang,18,0.78,False

Here’s what happened:

  
I’m a 27-year-old woman and my relationship with my family has never been easy. They’re the kind of people who think any joke is fair game, as long as someone laughs—even if it hurts someone else. I’ve tried to shrug it off over the years, but this time, they took things way too far.

  
A few weeks ago, after years of hard work and saving, I bought my first home. I gave up vacations, nights out, and pretty much anything extra to make this happen. It was a huge achievement for me, and I was so proud. Even though I was nervous, I wanted to share that milestone with my family.

  
We had a family dinner to celebrate. At first, everyone was congratulating me and asking about the house, and it seemed like they were genuinely happy for me. Then, halfway through, my brother (30) and sister (25) handed me an envelope, saying it was “a surprise to help with the house.”

  
Inside was what looked like an official legal notice saying my house purchase had been canceled due to a clerical error, and now it was being sold to someone else. It had details about my house, my name, and a legit-looking letterhead. I was completely blindsided.

  
Suddenly, everyone burst out laughing, and my brother shouted “Gotcha!” They had faked the entire letter, and apparently, the whole point was to see my reaction. I immediately started crying—and that just made them laugh harder. They even filmed the whole thing on their phones, planning to share it on social media.

  
When I could finally speak, I told them how cruel it was. This house meant the world to me, and they turned the moment into a joke. Their response? “You’re too sensitive, it was just a prank, lighten up!”

  
I left early, crushed. And honestly, this wasn’t the first time—they’ve humiliated me before, like “accidentally” spilling coffee on my outfit before a big interview, or pretending my dog was lost just for laughs.

  
So, I went no contact. No drama—I just stopped replying, blocked them on social media, and turned down family invites. Now I’m getting messages from extended family, telling me I’m selfish and breaking up the family. My mom even called crying, begging me to come back.

  
But honestly, I can’t forgive them. This latest prank was my breaking point. I don’t know how I could ever trust them again.

  
So, Reddit, AITA for cutting my family off after this prank?

  
\*\*Edit: Thanks for all your advice and support. I wanted to update because things have gotten even more intense.\*\*

  
After I cut off contact, I thought my family might eventually let it go, but that didn’t happen. For weeks, my brother and sister tried to force me to “see the funny side.” They started showing up at my house unannounced, banging on the door, insisting I talk to them. At first, I just ignored it, but it didn’t stop.

  
One night, I caught them outside my house with their phones out, recording themselves and yelling stuff like, “She can’t take a joke!” and “Let’s see how long she can hide!”—honestly, it felt more like harassment than a real attempt to make up.

  
Then, my car got egged. My security cameras caught my brother and sister doing it. I confronted them via text, telling them they’d gone too far and needed to stop. Their response? “You’re so dramatic. You’ll laugh about this someday.”

  
I realized I couldn’t handle this alone, so I went to the police and filed a harassment report. The police reviewed my security footage and agreed their behavior wasn’t okay. My siblings were contacted and warned to stay away.

  
Their reaction? More mockery and messages calling me a “snitch.” Some family members are taking their side, saying I should’ve just talked to them, but others (especially those who saw the footage) are horrified and support me completely.

  
I feel relief, but also sadness. It’s rough that my own family would treat me this way, but at least I’m starting to feel safe and in control again. I’m focusing on making my home a real sanctuary, surrounded by supportive people who actually respect me.

  
To anyone dealing with toxic family stuff: You’re not alone. It’s okay to protect your peace and put up boundaries. Thank you all for giving me the courage to stand up for myself. ❤️

  
\*\*Final update (hopefully):\*\*

It’s been a while since I last updated, but honestly, dealing with all this has been so draining. Even after involving the police, my brother and sister didn’t stop. I hoped they’d eventually give up, but instead, they doubled down. They kept sending mocking messages and even joked about getting a warning from the police. My extended family was divided—some said I overreacted, others were genuinely appalled by my siblings’ actions.

  
Then things escalated again. My security cameras caught them trespassing and vandalizing my property with toilet paper and shaving cream. That was it for me.

  
I went back to the police with the new footage, showing they’d ignored the previous warning. This time, I filed for a restraining order. With all the evidence—security footage, messages, and police reports—the judge granted it. My siblings were officially ordered to stay away from me, my home, and my workplace.

  
At first, they acted like it was all a joke, but when they realized I was serious, the harassment finally stopped. For the first time in a while, I feel safe. My home is peaceful, my phone is quiet, and my life is finally my own.

  
Some relatives still don’t get why I had to do this, but I don’t need their approval. I did what I had to do to protect myself.

  
If you’re dealing with family members who refuse to respect your boundaries, please know you aren’t obligated to put up with it. Your safety and well-being come first, always.

  
And if standing up for myself makes me a “snitch”? So be it. I’d rather be a snitch than a doormat.

  
Stay strong! ❤️

1qfhohr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qfhohr/meeting_new_people_no_hobbies/,Meeting New People - No Hobbies,"I’m an introverted ambivert with few friends in a small town. I’ve been wanting to make new meaningful connections, but it’s hard for me, especially starting conversations. I’m young and single so that offers me much freedom and opportunity. I’ve seen many other threads of people asking for ideas for meeting people, but I always have some issue with the advice people give:

\- Participate in your hobbies publicly: while this makes sense and I would love to do things with other people enjoying it together, I don’t have any hobbies. I’m trying new things, but it’s incredibly discouraging for me to be bad at stuff, so I quit before getting in much practice (and it would be embarrassing for me to be bad at something with other people watching). (I also have depression which drains motivation from me without will).

\- Ask someone from Work/School out: I don’t go to school and am not regularly scheduled for work yet, nor will be for the next month. Even once I start work, I’ll be an apprentice in a trade where I work solo and people just depend on me, there’s not a lot of time or opportunity to build connections.

\- Meetup/Facebook Events/Dating Apps: I live in a small town, the closest city to me, where all the events are, is at least an hour away. Dating apps are a trap for me and not an option. I personally think relationships feel superficial coming from this source, I want to meet people naturally.

\- Bars/Clubs: we don’t have clubs near me and all the bars are rundown small town bars, not really ones targeted towards people my age group. Not that I’ve tried them personally, but that’s from what I hear around. Plus loud, dark, crowded environments with flashing lights sometimes is crazy overstimulating for me and a living nightmare. And I’m a woman, so going alone makes me a little nervous.

We don’t have coffee shops either.

\- Money: A lot of things cost money. For tickets, for equipment, for whatever. I don’t mind spending money going out here and there, but I don’t want to everytime or even nearly everytime.

\- Volunteering: while I guess this is a good idea for meeting people, but when I volunteer I’m specifically there for what I’m volunteering for, I feel wrong for serving the public with the wrong intentions.

(Bonus) Weather: it’s currently winter. The events I do enjoying attending only happen in the warmer months (I live in the snowbelt so winters last a while) because they’re outdoors. And these events I just started getting into late last summer, so I didn’t have the best chance at meeting new people.

Am I being too picky? What do I need to change to help meet people (I’m working on hobbies and extroverted confidence)? Are there any other options I’m overlooking? Help, I’m trying not to isolate but I feel like I might be working against myself.",1,1768667420.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1qfhnqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1qfhnqu/swipe_land_chapter_2_the_tagline_that_cursed_us/,[Swipe Land] Chapter 2: The Tagline That Cursed Us All,"Rowan’s first day at GRAIL began, like most modern tragedies, with a lanyard.

It was the kind of lanyard that tried to flatter you—thick, matte, expensive, branded so subtly it was basically whispering you’re important now, please don’t notice you’re miserable. The badge photo was a crime scene: harsh lighting, Rowan’s smile set to “polite hostage,” their eyes doing that thing where they looked like they’d just been asked to explain their feelings in public.

The lobby smelled like citrus cleaner and ambition. A receptionist with perfect skin handed Rowan a tote bag that said MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING in clean, innocent font, which felt like a threat when you knew it was printed in bulk.

Jules met them at the security gates wearing sunglasses indoors, because Jules had never met a room they didn’t want to dominate.

“Welcome,” Jules said, like they owned the building, the air, and all the unresolved longing trapped between the glass panels. “To the Glass Cathedral.”

Rowan looked up.

The building’s interior was bright in that sterile, holy way—white walls, blonde wood, plants that looked like they’d been paid to be alive. People moved across the open floor like well-dressed ants carrying laptops instead of crumbs. Every surface reflected something back at you. Rowan’s reflection appeared in three different windows at once, each one looking like a different version of tired.

“You’re frowning,” Jules observed.

“I’m trying to keep my soul in my body,” Rowan said.

Jules patted their shoulder. “That’s adorable. We’ll grind it down to a marketable powder by Thursday.”

They walked past a wall of framed posters, all brand campaigns that looked like they were trying to seduce you into self-improvement.

FIND YOUR PERSON.
DON’T SETTLE.
BE BRAVE.
SAY IT FIRST.

Each one felt like it had been written by someone who’d never had to text “hey lol” after being left on read for fourteen hours.

They reached an elevator. It opened silently, like it was ashamed of sound.

Inside, Mina Park stood with a coffee and the face of someone who had not slept since the invention of machine learning. She looked up, took in Rowan, and nodded.

“You’re the copywriter,” Mina said. Not a question. A diagnosis.

Rowan’s mouth twitched. “I’m Rowan.”

“Mina.” She lifted her cup in a tiny salute. “You’re here for Soulmate Mode.”

Rowan’s stomach performed a small, unasked-for flip.

“Is that what we’re calling it,” Rowan said. “The thing that’s—”

“Haunting people?” Mina offered, dry as chalk.

Rowan stared. Jules made a delighted noise, like someone had just said the word drama in a room full of flammable materials.

Mina glanced at Jules. “We have a standup in ten. Try not to make it weird.”

Jules clasped their hands. “I live to make it weird.”

The elevator rose.

Rowan watched the numbers tick upward and tried not to feel like they were being carried into a temple where everyone worshipped metrics and sacrificed sincerity.

On the twentieth floor, the doors opened to a sea of desks and soft lighting. A giant screen displayed a live feed of user activity like the heartbeat of a god: swipes, messages, matches, tiny bursts of hope and disappointment rendered into cheerful graphs.

A sign on the wall read:

WE BUILD CONNECTION.

Below it, in smaller text:

(PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE SERVERS.)

Rowan followed Jules and Mina through the maze of glass meeting rooms named after concepts that sounded like therapy homework.

BOUNDARY
CLOSURE
VULNERABILITY
AFTERCARE

Rowan paused at AFTERCARE, because they couldn’t help it.

“Is this a joke?” Rowan asked.

Mina didn’t look back. “No. It’s a room.”

Jules leaned in. “Everything is a joke if you’re brave enough.”

They entered a meeting room called DESTINY, which felt like the building was making eye contact with Rowan on purpose.

There were eight people at the table, all with laptops open like shields. Someone had brought pastries arranged in a way that suggested the pastries had been curated by a committee.

At the head of the table sat Graham Kincaid.

He looked better than Rowan remembered from his profile photos, which was irritating. He wore a simple black shirt that made him look like a man who’d been styled by the concept of guilt. His hair was too neat to be accidental. His expression was calm, but his eyes had that restless, watchful thing—like he was always monitoring a room for exits and opinions.

Rowan’s phone, tucked in their bag, vibrated like it was experiencing a personal awakening.

Rowan ignored it. Rowan tried to ignore it.

Graham glanced up as Rowan entered, and for half a second there was recognition—sharp, immediate. Then it smoothed into something neutral, professional, controlled.

Rowan hated that their body noticed.

Graham said, “Rowan.”

Rowan said, “Graham.”

Jules did jazz hands with their whole face. “Okay! We’re all here! We’re all hydrated! We’re all emotionally stable!”

Mina coughed. Someone laughed like it was painful.

Graham’s gaze drifted to the screen at the front of the room. “Let’s start.”

The screen displayed the words:

SOULMATE MODE LAUNCH — COPY REVIEW

Rowan watched as Mina clicked through slides. Prompts, notifications, onboarding language. Each line was a tiny hook, designed to catch the softest parts of a person and tug.

Rowan’s heart did something stupid when the tagline appeared on the screen.

STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.

The room hummed with approval like a hive congratulating itself.

Graham leaned back. “It’s strong.”

Rowan’s throat tightened. “It’s reckless.”

A few heads turned. Jules’s eyes lit up, delighted by friction.

Graham’s mouth curved slightly. “Reckless can be good.”

Rowan stared at him. “Reckless can also be how you end up matched with your ex’s cousin at 2AM.”

Someone snorted. Mina’s lips twitched.

Graham’s eyes sharpened, amused. “So you’ve seen the early reports.”

Rowan looked around the table. “So you know it’s happening.”

A woman in a blazer—Priya, Rowan realized, from the staff directory—tapped her pen. “We’ve seen… anomalies.”

Mina said, deadpan, “The app is behaving like it has opinions.”

Rowan pointed at the tagline on the screen. “And we’re launching it anyway.”

Graham folded his hands. “We’re not launching a ghost story. We’re launching a product.”

Rowan heard themselves say it before they could stop it: “Products don’t quote poetry.”

The room went still in that corporate way, where everyone pretends stillness is thoughtfulness and not fear.

Mina looked at Rowan. “It quoted poetry?”

Rowan’s stomach dropped. Jules’s head snapped toward Rowan like a cat hearing a can open.

Rowan wished, briefly, that they could climb back into the elevator and ride it straight into the earth.

Rowan said, “Yesterday. It sent me a line. About April.”

Priya’s pen paused. “What line?”

Rowan looked at Graham. “April is the thirstiest month.”

Someone at the far end of the table made a strangled sound—half laugh, half prayer. Mina’s eyebrows lifted, slow.

Graham’s face didn’t change. Which, Rowan noted, was its own kind of answer.

Mina said, “That isn’t in our copy bank.”

Rowan said, “I know.”

Priya’s voice went colder. “Where would it have pulled it from?”

Rowan opened their mouth.

Graham spoke first. “Could be a test string. Could be a dev joke.”

Mina turned her head. “It’s not.”

Graham looked at Mina. “You’re sure.”

Mina’s eyes held his. “If it came through the production notification pipeline, it came from somewhere. And none of my team wrote that.”

The air in the room tightened. A plant in the corner looked stressed.

Rowan watched Graham’s jaw flex—just once—as if he was grinding down an impulse.

Then he smiled, small and charming and very practiced. “Okay. So we investigate. In the meantime, the launch schedule stands.”

Rowan’s laugh came out like a bark. “That’s insane.”

Graham’s gaze slid back to Rowan. “That’s business.”

Rowan leaned forward. “Is it business to match people with their worst idea of destiny?”

Graham’s eyes flashed. “People want destiny.”

Rowan’s voice sharpened. “People want water, too, but you’re not serving them the river. You’re selling them a thirst trap with a subscription tier.”

A few people looked down at their laptops like they’d suddenly remembered their screens were more interesting than conflict.

Jules, barely containing glee, whispered, “Oh my god.”

Graham stared at Rowan for a beat too long. Something in his expression flickered—irritation, interest, something like respect. Then it vanished behind the CEO mask.

He said, calm, “Rowan, you were hired to write the voice of this feature.”

Rowan said, “I wasn’t hired to summon a demon.”

Mina cleared her throat. “Technically, the demon is already here.”

Priya exhaled through her nose. “Fantastic.”

Graham held up a hand, like he was conducting an orchestra of panic into silence. “Here’s what we do. We keep the copy as is. We monitor the rollout. Mina’s team audits the pipeline. Priya assesses exposure. Rowan—” he glanced at them “—you refine the tone so it feels intentional. Not… haunted.”

Rowan stared at him. “You want me to make the ghost sound like a brand.”

Graham’s smile sharpened. “Exactly.”

Rowan hated how good he was at this. How he made the unreasonable feel like a plan.

Rowan hated, also, that it worked on people.

Mina clicked to the next slide.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS — TONE OPTIONS

Examples on screen:

Hey stranger. You up?

Your match is waiting. Don’t overthink it.

Love is a choice. Choose it.

Stop settling. Start summoning.


Rowan felt their phone vibrate again, like it was laughing.

Rowan reached into their bag, pulled it out, and held it face down on the table like a captured animal.

Mina’s gaze darted to it. “What’s it doing now?”

Rowan swallowed. “I don’t know.”

Graham’s eyes stayed on Rowan’s hands. “Flip it.”

Rowan hesitated. “No.”

Graham’s voice went softer, almost gentle. “Rowan.”

It was maddening that their name sounded different in his mouth. Like it mattered more. Like it could be a spell.

Rowan flipped the phone.

A notification glowed.

GRAIL — START SUMMONING.

Underneath, another line appeared, unasked for.

GRAIL — I MEAN YOU.

The room went silent in a way that felt… old. Like the building itself had stopped breathing.

Rowan stared at the screen until the words blurred.

Mina leaned forward, squinting. “That’s not in the list.”

Priya whispered, “Oh my god.”

Jules pressed a hand to their chest, thrilled and horrified. “It’s flirting.”

Rowan’s voice came out thin. “It’s targeting.”

Graham’s gaze locked on the phone. For the first time, something like real emotion cracked through his composure—a flicker of alarm, quickly shuttered.

He said, carefully, “Okay.”

Mina said, “Okay what.”

Graham looked around the table, CEO-mask back in place. “Okay,” he repeated, firmer. “We’re taking this offline.”

Priya blinked. “You’re pausing the launch?”

Graham’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “No. I’m taking that device offline.”

Rowan’s head snapped up. “Excuse me?”

Graham’s voice stayed calm. “Give it to Mina. We’ll isolate it, see what it’s pulling, where it’s coming from.”

Rowan pulled the phone back like it had teeth. “Absolutely not.”

The room vibrated with the kind of corporate tension that usually preceded someone crying in a stairwell.

Mina lifted a hand. “Rowan, if it’s generating unapproved copy, we need to investigate it.”

Rowan’s mouth went dry. “It’s my phone.”

Priya’s pen tapped once. “If it’s pulling content, it could be pulling anything.”

Rowan glanced around the room, suddenly aware of how small they were in this gleaming system. How easily they could become “a risk” instead of a person.

Graham watched them. His expression softened, just a fraction. “Rowan,” he said, quieter, “I’m not trying to take your property. I’m trying to stop this from escalating.”

Rowan’s laugh was sharp. “Escalating? It just told me ‘I mean you.’ That’s already escalated.”

Jules murmured, “It’s like a drunk poet in your pocket.”

Rowan shot them a look. Jules mimed zipping their lips, but their eyes were still sparkling.

Mina’s voice stayed practical. “Rowan. Give me ten minutes with it. You can watch the whole time.”

Rowan’s fingers tightened on the phone. Their heart thudded like it was trying to warn them about something.

Graham’s gaze held theirs. Something passed between them that felt uncomfortably intimate for a room called DESTINY.

Rowan said, “Fine. Ten minutes. And if it starts reading my thoughts, I’m quitting and moving to the woods.”

Mina took the phone carefully, like it was evidence. She slid it into a small signal-blocking pouch from her bag—because of course she carried one, because Mina lived in the future and the future was paranoid.

The screen went dark.

For a moment, the room felt… lighter.

Then the big dashboard screen at the front of the room flickered.

Just once.

A new line appeared at the bottom of the slide deck, as if someone had typed it into the presentation from inside the walls:

APRIL IS THE THIRSTIEST MONTH.

Rowan’s skin went cold.

Mina slowly turned her laptop toward herself, hands still. “That wasn’t me.”

Priya’s face drained. “Tell me that wasn’t—”

Jules whispered, reverent, “The building is haunted.”

Graham stood up so fast his chair squeaked, the first human sound he’d made all meeting.

His voice was clipped. “End the meeting. Now.”

People scrambled, laptops snapping shut, chairs scraping. The corporate spell broke into panic.

Rowan stayed seated for half a second too long, staring at the screen, at the line, at the feeling that something had just noticed them—and liked what it saw.

Graham came around the table. He stopped beside Rowan, close enough that Rowan could smell his cologne—clean, expensive, and faintly bitter, like grapefruit peel.

He said, low, so only Rowan could hear, “That line. It came to you first.”

Rowan’s throat tightened. “Yeah.”

Graham’s eyes searched Rowan’s face, not as a CEO now, but as a person standing too close to something he didn’t understand.

He said, “Why you?”

Rowan laughed softly, not because it was funny, but because it was the only sound that fit. “If I knew, I’d charge admission.”

Graham’s mouth twitched, almost a smile. “We need to talk.”

Rowan looked up at him. “About what.”

Graham’s gaze flicked to the hallway where Mina disappeared with the pouch, then back to Rowan.

“About the tagline,” he said, and there was something loaded in it—something that wasn’t just business.

Rowan swallowed. “It’s cursed.”

Graham’s smile finally reached his eyes, just a flash. “Then we’d better write it like we meant to curse the world.”

Rowan stared at him, heart doing the stupid thing again.

Graham stepped back, the moment gone, CEO-mask sliding back into place.

He said, louder, to the room, “Everyone out. Mina, call me when you know anything. Priya, start drafting contingencies. Jules—”

Jules lifted their hand. “Already panicking.”

Graham didn’t smile. “Good.”

Rowan stood, bag on shoulder, feeling the building’s brightness press against their skull.

As they walked out, the hallway screens—advertising screens meant to show company values—switched from a looping animation of the chalice logo to a single sentence, black text on a white background:

STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.

Then, beneath it, as if the system couldn’t help adding a footnote:

THIS IS WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

Rowan stopped walking.

Jules bumped into them. “Ow. Why did you stop?”

Rowan didn’t answer.

They were thinking about the notification: I mean you.

They were thinking about Graham’s question: Why you?

They were thinking about how the city outside was still dry, still waiting, still thirsty.

And how, inside this bright glass temple, something had started to speak back.

1qfhnqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1qfhnqj/i_was_humiliated_at_work_last_night/,I was humiliated at work last night.,"I had 10 minutes left of my lunch break and I had to finish my coffee on time. It was still hot, so it would be impossible to finish the whole thing within that time frame. So my solution was to pour half the amount in the cup in another, and mix them both with a little cold water to cool my coffees off and make them easier to drink. But then this lady behind me questioned me on using more than one cup. I tried explaining myself to her, but she just gave a blunt ""No"" response and told me not to do it again, even though I had less than 10 minutes before my shift resumed. So what? I either spend too long finishing my hot coffee or let that full cup go to waste?

It gets better: She then told me to read a notice about conserving the amount of cups used across the lunchroom...aloud. In the earshot of no less than 10 other workers. Needless to say, I did not appreciate this condescending attitude of hers and outright dismissing my solution to finishing a hot coffee on time and called her out on the matter, but she refused to listen and said she wanted to finish her lunch. A minute later, having further processed her toxic behavior she just showed me, I got really upset. And then she played the victim card and proceeded to tell the supervisor over it, as if SHE wasn't the one who provoked it in the first fucking place.

As of now, the supervisor already gave me the chance to hear me out and reported the incident to HR. Whether I'll get fired or not, I'm not sure yet, but considering the absolutely abhorrent attitude I was shown, I think that'll be a blessing in disguise.

I’ve had acquaintances, people around me, but never anyone I could just meet in the evening for coffee or a glass of wine and talk openly, without masks or pretenses. Never friends I could share little joys or big fears with.

The closest person in my life was my husband. He was my support, my friend, the person I trusted with everything—my thoughts, my struggles, my happiness, and my pain. And now we’re divorcing, and he’s with someone else. That feeling of emptiness sometimes hits me so hard it feels like the whole world has disappeared.

I don’t know how new relationships will form, how communication with my child will go, how life will go on. Everything feels strange and unfamiliar, and for the first time, I truly realize that I simply have no one to share with. And in that loneliness comes the truth: in 25 years, I never built friendships that could be a real support, like my husband once was.

It’s difficult and scary, but there’s truth in it too: now I see that I’ll have to learn to be there for myself, to be my own support, to find joy in small things, and to open myself to new connections.

1qfhmia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1qfhmia/all_the_pretty_things/,All the Pretty Things,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I’ve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying.

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning.

It read, “It’s the pretty things that matter,” scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees.

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There’s not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing.

So that’s what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand.

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I’d taken a million times before.

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before:

A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, “isn’t she pretty?” jagged and messy.

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall.

Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window.

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space.

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep:

The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8.

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation.

However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, “Isn’t she pretty?” with a smiley face underneath.

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years.

I explained the events to the police, with the doll’s head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they’d examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured them that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.

While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70’s rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch.

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness.

I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated.

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned.

Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could’ve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that.

I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere.

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again.

Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning.

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn’t just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies.

The same message under each display:

“Isn’t she pretty?”

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly.

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for.

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile.

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me.

DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear.

As you’d imagine, it’s difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That’s what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed…out of sync with the storm.

I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every big flash of light, and then there’d be thunder.

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again.

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.

Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain.

Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest.

I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night.

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly.

Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me.

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be.

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house.

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin.

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found.

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward.

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn’t even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound:

click

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles.

Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care.

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I’d stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night.

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me.

A traveler’s trunk that you’d see on a train, across the top, the phrase “All the pretty things.”

I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12.

Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case.

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

Rowan’s first day at GRAIL began, like most modern tragedies, with a lanyard.

It was the kind of lanyard that tried to flatter you—thick, matte, expensive, branded so subtly it was basically whispering you’re important now, please don’t notice you’re miserable. The badge photo was a crime scene: harsh lighting, Rowan’s smile set to “polite hostage,” their eyes doing that thing where they looked like they’d just been asked to explain their feelings in public.

The lobby smelled like citrus cleaner and ambition. A receptionist with perfect skin handed Rowan a tote bag that said MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING in clean, innocent font, which felt like a threat when you knew it was printed in bulk.

Jules met them at the security gates wearing sunglasses indoors, because Jules had never met a room they didn’t want to dominate.

“Welcome,” Jules said, like they owned the building, the air, and all the unresolved longing trapped between the glass panels. “To the Glass Cathedral.”

Rowan looked up.

The building’s interior was bright in that sterile, holy way—white walls, blonde wood, plants that looked like they’d been paid to be alive. People moved across the open floor like well-dressed ants carrying laptops instead of crumbs. Every surface reflected something back at you. Rowan’s reflection appeared in three different windows at once, each one looking like a different version of tired.

“You’re frowning,” Jules observed.

“I’m trying to keep my soul in my body,” Rowan said.

Jules patted their shoulder. “That’s adorable. We’ll grind it down to a marketable powder by Thursday.”

They walked past a wall of framed posters, all brand campaigns that looked like they were trying to seduce you into self-improvement.

FIND YOUR PERSON.
DON’T SETTLE.
BE BRAVE.
SAY IT FIRST.

Each one felt like it had been written by someone who’d never had to text “hey lol” after being left on read for fourteen hours.

They reached an elevator. It opened silently, like it was ashamed of sound.

Inside, Mina Park stood with a coffee and the face of someone who had not slept since the invention of machine learning. She looked up, took in Rowan, and nodded.

“You’re the copywriter,” Mina said. Not a question. A diagnosis.

Rowan’s mouth twitched. “I’m Rowan.”

“Mina.” She lifted her cup in a tiny salute. “You’re here for Soulmate Mode.”

Rowan’s stomach performed a small, unasked-for flip.

“Is that what we’re calling it,” Rowan said. “The thing that’s—”

“Haunting people?” Mina offered, dry as chalk.

Rowan stared. Jules made a delighted noise, like someone had just said the word drama in a room full of flammable materials.

Mina glanced at Jules. “We have a standup in ten. Try not to make it weird.”

Jules clasped their hands. “I live to make it weird.”

The elevator rose.

Rowan watched the numbers tick upward and tried not to feel like they were being carried into a temple where everyone worshipped metrics and sacrificed sincerity.

On the twentieth floor, the doors opened to a sea of desks and soft lighting. A giant screen displayed a live feed of user activity like the heartbeat of a god: swipes, messages, matches, tiny bursts of hope and disappointment rendered into cheerful graphs.

A sign on the wall read:

WE BUILD CONNECTION.

Below it, in smaller text:

(PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE SERVERS.)

Rowan followed Jules and Mina through the maze of glass meeting rooms named after concepts that sounded like therapy homework.

BOUNDARY
CLOSURE
VULNERABILITY
AFTERCARE

Rowan paused at AFTERCARE, because they couldn’t help it.

“Is this a joke?” Rowan asked.

Mina didn’t look back. “No. It’s a room.”

Jules leaned in. “Everything is a joke if you’re brave enough.”

They entered a meeting room called DESTINY, which felt like the building was making eye contact with Rowan on purpose.

There were eight people at the table, all with laptops open like shields. Someone had brought pastries arranged in a way that suggested the pastries had been curated by a committee.

At the head of the table sat Graham Kincaid.

He looked better than Rowan remembered from his profile photos, which was irritating. He wore a simple black shirt that made him look like a man who’d been styled by the concept of guilt. His hair was too neat to be accidental. His expression was calm, but his eyes had that restless, watchful thing—like he was always monitoring a room for exits and opinions.

Rowan’s phone, tucked in their bag, vibrated like it was experiencing a personal awakening.

Rowan ignored it. Rowan tried to ignore it.

Graham glanced up as Rowan entered, and for half a second there was recognition—sharp, immediate. Then it smoothed into something neutral, professional, controlled.

Rowan hated that their body noticed.

Graham said, “Rowan.”

Rowan said, “Graham.”

Jules did jazz hands with their whole face. “Okay! We’re all here! We’re all hydrated! We’re all emotionally stable!”

Mina coughed. Someone laughed like it was painful.

Graham’s gaze drifted to the screen at the front of the room. “Let’s start.”

The screen displayed the words:

SOULMATE MODE LAUNCH — COPY REVIEW

Rowan watched as Mina clicked through slides. Prompts, notifications, onboarding language. Each line was a tiny hook, designed to catch the softest parts of a person and tug.

Rowan’s heart did something stupid when the tagline appeared on the screen.

STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.

The room hummed with approval like a hive congratulating itself.

Graham leaned back. “It’s strong.”

Rowan’s throat tightened. “It’s reckless.”

A few heads turned. Jules’s eyes lit up, delighted by friction.

Graham’s mouth curved slightly. “Reckless can be good.”

Rowan stared at him. “Reckless can also be how you end up matched with your ex’s cousin at 2AM.”

Someone snorted. Mina’s lips twitched.

Graham’s eyes sharpened, amused. “So you’ve seen the early reports.”

Rowan looked around the table. “So you know it’s happening.”

A woman in a blazer—Priya, Rowan realized, from the staff directory—tapped her pen. “We’ve seen… anomalies.”

Mina said, deadpan, “The app is behaving like it has opinions.”

Rowan pointed at the tagline on the screen. “And we’re launching it anyway.”

Graham folded his hands. “We’re not launching a ghost story. We’re launching a product.”

Rowan heard themselves say it before they could stop it: “Products don’t quote poetry.”

The room went still in that corporate way, where everyone pretends stillness is thoughtfulness and not fear.

Mina looked at Rowan. “It quoted poetry?”

Rowan’s stomach dropped. Jules’s head snapped toward Rowan like a cat hearing a can open.

Rowan wished, briefly, that they could climb back into the elevator and ride it straight into the earth.

Rowan said, “Yesterday. It sent me a line. About April.”

Priya’s pen paused. “What line?”

Rowan looked at Graham. “April is the thirstiest month.”

Someone at the far end of the table made a strangled sound—half laugh, half prayer. Mina’s eyebrows lifted, slow.

Graham’s face didn’t change. Which, Rowan noted, was its own kind of answer.

Mina said, “That isn’t in our copy bank.”

Rowan said, “I know.”

Priya’s voice went colder. “Where would it have pulled it from?”

Rowan opened their mouth.

Graham spoke first. “Could be a test string. Could be a dev joke.”

Mina turned her head. “It’s not.”

Graham looked at Mina. “You’re sure.”

Mina’s eyes held his. “If it came through the production notification pipeline, it came from somewhere. And none of my team wrote that.”

The air in the room tightened. A plant in the corner looked stressed.

Rowan watched Graham’s jaw flex—just once—as if he was grinding down an impulse.

Then he smiled, small and charming and very practiced. “Okay. So we investigate. In the meantime, the launch schedule stands.”

Rowan’s laugh came out like a bark. “That’s insane.”

Graham’s gaze slid back to Rowan. “That’s business.”

Rowan leaned forward. “Is it business to match people with their worst idea of destiny?”

Graham’s eyes flashed. “People want destiny.”

Rowan’s voice sharpened. “People want water, too, but you’re not serving them the river. You’re selling them a thirst trap with a subscription tier.”

A few people looked down at their laptops like they’d suddenly remembered their screens were more interesting than conflict.

Jules, barely containing glee, whispered, “Oh my god.”

Graham stared at Rowan for a beat too long. Something in his expression flickered—irritation, interest, something like respect. Then it vanished behind the CEO mask.

He said, calm, “Rowan, you were hired to write the voice of this feature.”

Rowan said, “I wasn’t hired to summon a demon.”

Mina cleared her throat. “Technically, the demon is already here.”

Priya exhaled through her nose. “Fantastic.”

Graham held up a hand, like he was conducting an orchestra of panic into silence. “Here’s what we do. We keep the copy as is. We monitor the rollout. Mina’s team audits the pipeline. Priya assesses exposure. Rowan—” he glanced at them “—you refine the tone so it feels intentional. Not… haunted.”

Rowan stared at him. “You want me to make the ghost sound like a brand.”

Graham’s smile sharpened. “Exactly.”

Rowan hated how good he was at this. How he made the unreasonable feel like a plan.

Rowan hated, also, that it worked on people.

Mina clicked to the next slide.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS — TONE OPTIONS

Examples on screen:

Hey stranger. You up?

Your match is waiting. Don’t overthink it.

Love is a choice. Choose it.

Stop settling. Start summoning.


Rowan felt their phone vibrate again, like it was laughing.

Rowan reached into their bag, pulled it out, and held it face down on the table like a captured animal.

Mina’s gaze darted to it. “What’s it doing now?”

Rowan swallowed. “I don’t know.”

Graham’s eyes stayed on Rowan’s hands. “Flip it.”

Rowan hesitated. “No.”

Graham’s voice went softer, almost gentle. “Rowan.”

It was maddening that their name sounded different in his mouth. Like it mattered more. Like it could be a spell.

Rowan flipped the phone.

A notification glowed.

GRAIL — START SUMMONING.

Underneath, another line appeared, unasked for.

GRAIL — I MEAN YOU.

The room went silent in a way that felt… old. Like the building itself had stopped breathing.

Rowan stared at the screen until the words blurred.

Mina leaned forward, squinting. “That’s not in the list.”

Priya whispered, “Oh my god.”

Jules pressed a hand to their chest, thrilled and horrified. “It’s flirting.”

Rowan’s voice came out thin. “It’s targeting.”

Graham’s gaze locked on the phone. For the first time, something like real emotion cracked through his composure—a flicker of alarm, quickly shuttered.

He said, carefully, “Okay.”

Mina said, “Okay what.”

Graham looked around the table, CEO-mask back in place. “Okay,” he repeated, firmer. “We’re taking this offline.”

Priya blinked. “You’re pausing the launch?”

Graham’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “No. I’m taking that device offline.”

Rowan’s head snapped up. “Excuse me?”

Graham’s voice stayed calm. “Give it to Mina. We’ll isolate it, see what it’s pulling, where it’s coming from.”

Rowan pulled the phone back like it had teeth. “Absolutely not.”

The room vibrated with the kind of corporate tension that usually preceded someone crying in a stairwell.

Mina lifted a hand. “Rowan, if it’s generating unapproved copy, we need to investigate it.”

Rowan’s mouth went dry. “It’s my phone.”

Priya’s pen tapped once. “If it’s pulling content, it could be pulling anything.”

Rowan glanced around the room, suddenly aware of how small they were in this gleaming system. How easily they could become “a risk” instead of a person.

Graham watched them. His expression softened, just a fraction. “Rowan,” he said, quieter, “I’m not trying to take your property. I’m trying to stop this from escalating.”

Rowan’s laugh was sharp. “Escalating? It just told me ‘I mean you.’ That’s already escalated.”

Jules murmured, “It’s like a drunk poet in your pocket.”

Rowan shot them a look. Jules mimed zipping their lips, but their eyes were still sparkling.

Mina’s voice stayed practical. “Rowan. Give me ten minutes with it. You can watch the whole time.”

Rowan’s fingers tightened on the phone. Their heart thudded like it was trying to warn them about something.

Graham’s gaze held theirs. Something passed between them that felt uncomfortably intimate for a room called DESTINY.

Rowan said, “Fine. Ten minutes. And if it starts reading my thoughts, I’m quitting and moving to the woods.”

Mina took the phone carefully, like it was evidence. She slid it into a small signal-blocking pouch from her bag—because of course she carried one, because Mina lived in the future and the future was paranoid.

The screen went dark.

For a moment, the room felt… lighter.

Then the big dashboard screen at the front of the room flickered.

Just once.

A new line appeared at the bottom of the slide deck, as if someone had typed it into the presentation from inside the walls:

APRIL IS THE THIRSTIEST MONTH.

Rowan’s skin went cold.

Mina slowly turned her laptop toward herself, hands still. “That wasn’t me.”

Priya’s face drained. “Tell me that wasn’t—”

Jules whispered, reverent, “The building is haunted.”

Graham stood up so fast his chair squeaked, the first human sound he’d made all meeting.

His voice was clipped. “End the meeting. Now.”

People scrambled, laptops snapping shut, chairs scraping. The corporate spell broke into panic.

Rowan stayed seated for half a second too long, staring at the screen, at the line, at the feeling that something had just noticed them—and liked what it saw.

Graham came around the table. He stopped beside Rowan, close enough that Rowan could smell his cologne—clean, expensive, and faintly bitter, like grapefruit peel.

He said, low, so only Rowan could hear, “That line. It came to you first.”

Rowan’s throat tightened. “Yeah.”

Graham’s eyes searched Rowan’s face, not as a CEO now, but as a person standing too close to something he didn’t understand.

He said, “Why you?”

Rowan laughed softly, not because it was funny, but because it was the only sound that fit. “If I knew, I’d charge admission.”

Graham’s mouth twitched, almost a smile. “We need to talk.”

Rowan looked up at him. “About what.”

Graham’s gaze flicked to the hallway where Mina disappeared with the pouch, then back to Rowan.

“About the tagline,” he said, and there was something loaded in it—something that wasn’t just business.

Rowan swallowed. “It’s cursed.”

Graham’s smile finally reached his eyes, just a flash. “Then we’d better write it like we meant to curse the world.”

Rowan stared at him, heart doing the stupid thing again.

Graham stepped back, the moment gone, CEO-mask sliding back into place.

He said, louder, to the room, “Everyone out. Mina, call me when you know anything. Priya, start drafting contingencies. Jules—”

Jules lifted their hand. “Already panicking.”

Graham didn’t smile. “Good.”

Rowan stood, bag on shoulder, feeling the building’s brightness press against their skull.

As they walked out, the hallway screens—advertising screens meant to show company values—switched from a looping animation of the chalice logo to a single sentence, black text on a white background:

STOP SETTLING. START SUMMONING.

Then, beneath it, as if the system couldn’t help adding a footnote:

THIS IS WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

Rowan stopped walking.

Jules bumped into them. “Ow. Why did you stop?”

Rowan didn’t answer.

They were thinking about the notification: I mean you.

They were thinking about Graham’s question: Why you?

They were thinking about how the city outside was still dry, still waiting, still thirsty.

And how, inside this bright glass temple, something had started to speak back.
