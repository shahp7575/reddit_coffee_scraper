Guys… I’ve done some **deep investigative journalism** (stood in line for coffee once) and I regret to inform you:

# Waterloo students are now so racist

they’ve gone **full DLC expansion pack**.  
Waterloo Racism: *Indians Edition™*.

Apparently racism now comes in **seasonal flavours**, like Starbucks lattes:

* Fall: pumpkin spice bigotry
* Winter: peppermint microaggressions
* Spring: “there’s too many Indians” pollen
* Summer: limited edition genocide takes (??)

Every day on campus is like watching strangers speed-run “How to say the worst thing possible in public.”

Some dude in line was like:

>

Bro, you’re in **DC Timmies**, there’s too many *everything* except functioning outlets.

Another group apparently said:

>

Idk man, maybe they saw the Co-op salaries and wanted in?? Be serious.



At this point I’m convinced Waterloo orientation should just include:

Step 1: Pick major    
Step 2: Pick elective    
Step 3: Pick which group you’re racist to this year   


If racism is really rising this fast, the Registrar’s gonna have to issue prerequisites:

The seller? A college student in Bangladesh who has been quietly exploiting misconfigured WordPress and cPanel sites for over a year.

He’s amassed thousands of vulnerable sites and resells access through Telegram channels where low- to mid-tier threat actors trade shells, exploits, and ready-to-use access. Nearly half of the compromised sites come from education, and a significant portion from government organizations a perfect fit for threat actors seeking high-value footholds. Researchers found that some buyers aren’t just after money. A subset is deploying a stealthy Chinese webshell called Beima, which blends into normal API traffic, decrypts commands using RSA keys, and hides payload timestamps to evade detection. It’s currently slipping past most security tools, making these cheap sites ideal C2 infrastructure.

I’m a 31f and I’ve been on 150mg of Bupropion SR for about 3 years now. Recently, I’ve had a really rough patch in life and was feeling really depressed so my GP hesitantly doubled my dose (I’m in france and they don’t like prescribing bupropion but because I’ve had terrible experiences with a lot of other depression meds, she thought this was the best course to take)

The first 4 days were absolutely fine. Some chest pains after taking the 2nd dose in the afternoon ( I took one morning, one 8 hours later) but otherwise no problems. Then, the fifth day I took my 2nd dose and got the similar chest pain but with it came this sensation I can only describe as being extremely high to the point where I felt like I was disappearing into the background of my life. Idk, it’s the feeling of when I‘ve been incredibly stoned and to talk or even simply move seems like a huge amount of effort and I really am not a fan of the feeling. My husband noticed I was being weird and it just opened the flood gates and I basically had a full on panic attack over it. 

(The only difference I can think of from that day vs the first few days was I went into my work studio and I typically drink more coffee when I’m there. I was there from 2-5 and drank 2 espressos ( I had 2 espressos that morning too). I think my last one was around 3/4 and I took my second dose around 6:30. Could this be relevant?)

Due to this, I decided to go immediately back to my 150mg dose the next day. This morning (the morning after not taking the second dose the night before) I woke up with a killer headache like I was hungover though I didn’t drink anything. Could it be related.

Now, I’m at a loss. Bupropion 150mg treated me so well until this depression spell and I can’t parse out where it’s due to the meds not working or life just being more generally suck-ish now more than usual. I have a psych appoint New Year’s Eve and I’m afraid they are gonna pull me off it. I am in remission for an ED and so bupropion has been the only drug to A. work properly without making me suicidal and B. doesn’t cause weight gain (which will make me spiral regardless of what the drug does). Does anyone have any advice? Was this ‘episode’ the other night something someone else has experienced and will it just go away after a while? Should I have titrated up to 300mg? Does anyone know of any similar drug to Bupropion I could float to my psych? Any or all help is welcome!",2,1764928536.0,bupropion,2,1.0,False

1per5b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1per5b6/do_other_people_have_written_out_or_planned/,Do other people have written out or planned responses?,"I guess I'm new to autism. I mean it was always there and I haven't changed how I deal with things but learning my actions are different to others and yet others with autism do the same thing has been fascinating. The past year I have really learnt a lot about myself after getting support and then diagnosed when I only first went for ADHD. 

When I was a little kid I figured out that I was different, even if I didn't know why until later in life. I gathered as much information as little me could process, about how my parents or friends acted in certain situations either physically or mentally.

The thing that has gotten me recently is the belief that autism = stupid. I know I am not the best at reading a room or an individual, where I can for instance pick up when something is wrong/ there a negative emotion but unless someone has communicated with me I cannot figure out what it is, obviously if I see someone crying I know they're sad but even when someone smiles I cannot tell if they're happy to be talking to me or smiling for the sake if it. 

With all of that in mind it absolutely does not mean I cannot hold conversation which is seen as a stereotype, I game with my friends multiple times a week and never stop yapping to my partner. However I realise I know how to talk to them and how they are doing because of their tone changes, voice pitch, eyebrow raises etc... i'm not blind. Which comes from me actively studying that person, since in a weird way figuring people out is of interest/ amusement to me, I like to see how quickly during our interactions I can match someones non verbal mannerisms to their expressed emotions, and when I told the doctor this it just made me seem more autistic. 

I have planned methods or lines. If a softer person tells me about the weather I find repeating it back to them the way you would talk to a toddler who is showing you something you already know exists so you don't crush their little spirit, make them seem happy and open to talk. Then if a rougher person talks about the weather I find it more fitting to repeat it back in a harder tone in a way thats a little heated, which to me makes them feel validated and in turn continues the conversation. 

I will do this with most minor conversation starters as I do find most people have a set structure to things they talk about including other things like the state of the world/ the price of items/ cost of living, current events/ holidays, and the environment at the time such as the coffee taste or pictures on the wall in a cafe. 

I never and I mean never start conversations with people who I am not close with, yet doing this has somehow lead me to be a regular person other parents talk to on the school run or colleagues have gone out of there way to talk to instead of working. 

Whilst I sometimes feel like I don't get opinions because I have not learnt how to correctly navigate visual or emotional cues from my conversation starters or input towards people I don't know yet. I do find my approach pressure free and although sometimes when I get caught up in lots of conversations, as a person who has been voluntarily void of verbal transactions for most of my life, I get overwhelmed, that I do actually enjoy these conversations for the most part now and enjoy the company of people I do not know, which in of itself is very interesting. 

If you made it this far thank you. 

So, on to the question. How do you deal with people you do not know, who, in a crude way, you feel different to?

1per3gs,https://i.redd.it/mqfgz85oxc5g1.png,Advice needed: my lenovo yoga 7 14arp8 stopped charging from both usb-C ports.,"Hi all, it's my first time here so apologies if it doesn't meet the correct formatting. Yesterday coffee and my laptop had a rendevouz in my backpack and since then chraging doesn't work anymore on both usb-C ports. The laptop (14arp8) otherwise works fine. I have some assumptions what could have gone wrong and I would like to hear from someone more knowledgeable which is correct, if any,  and how I could proceede to repair it. 

1) maybe a short circuit was detected and the laptop disabling charging all together to avoid corrision? I opened up the laptop and don't see any fluids that might cause any short circuit (picture, USB-C is at the bottom left), so if that were right it would need to work again? (I let the laptop dry for a day next to a radiator, before trying out chraging again). 

2) the battery charging circuit died and charging doesn't work anymore. Unfortunately i neither have a schematic nor layout and wouldn't know which part needs replacement if that were the case. Charging my smartphone with another USB-A from the other side of the laptop works just fine, it seems to be really just the two usb-C ports.

What might be more reasonable? I found a replacement guide from lenovo, but they don't mention a battery charging circuit. Or is that on the mainboard itself? Thank you for reading all the way to the end. If anyone has any input, feel free to share it. It would be well appreciated!

I have been in mutually committed heterosexual relationship now with someone (31M) for a year and about 3 months now. I’m (28F) ruminating on something they said yesterday during a conversation/argument. I asked what efforts they wanted me to do for the sake of the relationship. They went back to say something they had mentioned to me before: styling my clothes more pleasantly for daily outings that could include their presence. From the times they’ve mentioned it before I’ve come to understand they mean not wearing leggings nor sweatpants equivalents. We live together in a place with cold winters, or at least cold to me as I was born and rise with tropical climates of days with 30 degree Celsius on average. They do not mind my winter pijamas or indoor house clothes as much as clothes that I wear when I go outside with him for coffee and lunch and such. Yesterday when he brought up this idea for “efforts” again I responded saying that was something he could do as well. They work from home every single day and their daily look includes sweatpants and a nice sweater for occasional zoom calls. They have also grown comfortable wearing the same sweatpants they sleep on out on quick grocery runs. I do not actually mind this at all. I simply said that in response because it irks me they don’t see the double standard of their argument on clothes we each wear and why we wear them and how. My man also always has an answer for everything so when I said that he said “well you should help me pick my clothes better also I never know any of that stuff you know that, that’s what couples do you know, compromise” If I have to “dress myself better” since he’s asking for me to do so, and if I’m asking the same thing in return of him but ALSO have to pick said clothes for him, how is that a compromise since there is more for me to do than him? Am I just stupid and that is in fact a compromise?

Emma was walking along the streets, under the flickering street lamps and the moths on them. She didn't realise how long she walked around. Something about the cold air of midnight was comforting. In a morbid way. She let out all the heavy breaths her lungs have been suffocated by. The air grabbed them and shaped them into fog. She was thinking of how to do it. Train track? Too far away... River? No, she can swim... Maybe jump off a tall building? Might work... Her eyes started searching for tall buildings. The darkness was giving way to the soft morning light that comes to announce the sun before the sun is out. She kicked a stone as she walked. Would mom cry? There's no way. She would be happy to be rid of her biggest headache. Dad would've cried though, if he was alive... Would he be happy to see her if she went to him? Or would he call her stupid? The stone escaped her, leaving a slight scraping on her boots. She sighed. She was cold. Way too cold. Like death.

That's when she saw that. One solitary building in the whole street with lights on. It glowed in a soft yellow light amidst the otherwise gloomy gray bunch of rectangles. She walked closer. The smell of freshly baked bread filled her nostrils along with some Italian song playing in low fidelity in a radio. She peeped to see a bunch of bakers inside, working and singing along to the radio. There was a certain warmth about it. She just stood by the glass window and watched. There's a lovely old man with a salt and pepper beard making dough, though he does not look old at all health-wise, an adorable fluffy guy with a small crochet hat egg-washing loaves, a man and a woman who appear to be a couple working on pastries, and a sweet old lady cleaning around. Emma hugged herself, wrapping her old hoodie tighter around her body. She rubbed her arms as she watched them. The fluffy man was now prepping the coffee machine. The old woman opened the door of the cafe to give some scraps to a stray cat that was waiting outside. She gently petted the cat with her wrinkled hand and cooed. Then she noticed Emma.

""Ay, why you outside? Very cold, come in, cafe latte very fresh!"" She urged. Emma didn't know what to do for a second but something about the old lady made her not want to decline. When nonna tells you to do something, you listen to her. Emma walked inside. It was even warmer than she expected. She sat down on a stool. The old lady handed her a cup of coffee. She took it gratefully. ""Gracie nonna"" she said with a bad Italian accent. Nonna smiled wide showing some missing teeth. The old man who was making loaves took a batch of bread out of the oven to put another batch in. He sang along to the radio in a raspy old voice that sounded like a beautiful jazz bar ""Lo canto al ritmo del dolce tuo respiro... È primavera, Sarà perché ti amo..."" He cut a slice from one of the fresh loaves and handed it to Emma. ""Try. Very soft. You like?"" She took the loaf. The man urgently waved his hands around ""Attenta! You blow on it!"" He took the slice from her and blew on it to cool it down before handing it back to her. She giggled and bit into the slice and it nearly melted in her mouth. She hummed with satisfaction. ""Soft no?"" The man smiled proudly. ""Very very soft, mister..."" She looked at him. ""Dante"" ""...mister Dante"" he nodded contently.

The fluffy man introduced himself as Marco and the couple, Gloria and Laurence, who are to be married in two months, gave her samples of pastries to try. The stray cat meowed from outside once its food was done. Marco went outside with some more of the leftovers and put them down for the cat. Old man Dante started making a few bruscettas for the workers and handed one to Emma. ""You like vegetable?"" She nodded. ""Good good. And eat cheese. Young woman must eat good"" he said with a thick accent and years of wisdom ringing in his voice. She nodded and bit into her bruscetta. It was the best bruscetta she had ever had. She felt something soft rubbing against her ankle. She looked down to see the stray cat nuzzling her leg. She smiled. That was the first smile that wasn't forced, in a very very long time.

There was a certain warmth that enveloped her without crushing her. Suddenly, the world was full of life. Dante pulled the old lady in by her hand and started swaying to the music. The old lady laughed and danced with him. Gloria leaned against Laurence's shoulder as they watched. Marco started cleaning up as the last round of baking was coming to an end. The stray cat meowed and walked around. Gloria and Laurence started putting the pastries into trays to load the display shelves. Emma got up and pulled the sleeves of her hoodie up to her elbows, getting beside them to help. She had forgotten about the self harm scars on her arms. She usually never reveales her arms. Gloria put her arm around her shoulder and gave her a squeeze with a soft smile and nod. Like saying ""hey, I understand"" Emma felt her hand trembling, almost dropping the pastry. Laurence quickly took the pastry and put it away, then gave her a gentle tap on her shoulder. She found herself leaning against Gloria. She wrapped her arms around Emma, hugging her tight and warm without crushing her. Emma found herself crying quietly. She felt a rough yet gentle hand on her back. Nonna. She kissed Emma's head. Saying so much without saying anything. Emma opened her hands and collapsed into Nonna's shoulder. Nonna petted her head and cooed gently. She let everything out. Everything. It felt like getting an anvil out of her chest. Nonna wiped her tears. The cat rubbed against her leg, like trying to comfort her. She wiped her eyes as she kneeled down and petted it. It meowed and nuzzled her hand. 

She got back up and let out a sigh. One of relief. One of rejuvenation perhaps. ""I think I'll go... It's morning... Customers are gonna come"" she said. Nonna and the couple nodded. Dante packed a fresh loaf of garlic bread in paper and handed it to her. ""You go home and eat. With cafe, sì? Eat good"" she nodded and smiled. Nonna gave her a quick squeeze and a forehead kiss. Marco smiled and waved. The couple were busy dancing to the radio but they bid her goodbye amidst their giggles. She walked out of the bakery. The bread was warm in her exposed hand. She was warm.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1per1ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1per1ga/my_friend_got_in_a_coma_cuz_of_this_game/,my friend got in a coma cuz of this game,"This'll be weird, considering that TF2 isn't really the type of game you'd expect to harm someone. Sure, mentally, but never physically. I just wanna tell you guys this in case, and please reach out if you know something.

Ever since junior high, I've been friends with my buddy, Kyle. He's always so busy with steam and especially in TF2. I still remember when he recommended playing the game. Of course, I liked it, but I never found any time to play. This is connected to my current issue, somehow..

I got home from school, yes, we're like grade 12 now. I was gonna do some quick assignments using ChatGPT. Normally, I'd use my phone, but it was low on batt because I used it at school. I was gonna text him ""any shit happened for you today?"", but I saw that he was on TF2. So, typical friend etiquette, I trolled him. I sent him a text saying ""spy behind u"". And I knew he saw it because a few seconds after I sent him the text, he shot another back saying ""I just died to a soldier."" He followed with ""you btch."". I chuckled a little, wanting to ragebait him more, but I crammed lots of assignments and most of them were due tomorrow, so I closed steam and tabbed back to my homework.

At least half an hour had gone by already, and I only had like 2 essays and a slideshow assignment left to complete, so I sent him a text saying I'll hop on soon. ""all talk, but no do"" he replied. I scoffed, and as I was about to tab back into my assigns, he sent a text ""just dont leave me be, fucko"". I ignored it, and went back to doing my school shit.

Finally,  I finished it all. It was midnight already. Usually, I'd flop onto my bed, but I still had a promise for that guy. So, I opened steam and texted him. ""hopping on, better not be dustbowl"", he replied with ""watever"". I still joined, not caring about any of his tomfoolery shit. It was nucleus, fortunately. He was playing pyro, even though he's a sniper main. I was a spy and medic main, but since there's already like, 3 spies, I went medic.

I can't say I didn't have a fun time, no. This game was a gem in Valve history, so of course it would be hilarious, irritatting, and fun. I also managed to no scope some poor scout as sniper, which I also got surprised about. After a couple of games, I decided to go to sleep. I was just gonna overdose on coffee tomorrow to not sleep in class, so would he, so we planned to meet at a starbucks near our campus. I went to bed, closed my eyes, and fell into slumberworld.

The next day, Kyle never came. Disappointed, I sent him a text on WhatsApp. ""yo, dickbend, where r u?"" no response, ""youll get expelled cuz of how much you skip school, yknow"" no response. I got so irritated that I called a taxi just to go to his house and to hit him with a  notebook. As the taxi drove to his address, I couldn't help but notice that he hadn't been online. Normal Kyle wouldve atleast left me on read or something, but no, still no signs of him. When I arrived at his address, I knocked on the door. His parents opened the door, and they let me in, since they already knew me because Kyle usually went to my house, and I usually went to his, anyways. They said that he had gone into a coma, it was terrible they said. Blood came out of his mouth and his eyes clouded over.. I felt a little nauseous imagining it. But a detail caught my attention.. they said that he was still on his chair, still on his desk, and still playing some game. Of course, I knew that game was TF2, but how? I went to the hospital to see him, but he was just limp, and his body was pale, like he had died, but he still had a pulse. I skipped school that day. I went on steam, and I saw him online. How? Is my mind messing with me or some shit? I saw Kyle on a hospital bed, in a coma. How would he be online right now?? I knew it couldn't have been anyone else because Kyle's brother works abroad, and Kyle and his brother were the only people who knew how to operate a computer in his family. I opened my DMs, and saw that he had sent me some messages. ""just dont leave me be, fucko"". It was that same text, over and over again. I didn't wanna go on TF2 ever again, I couldn't.

If anyone knows about this, please reach out, do anything to help. Just give me an explanation, please. I just wanna play with Kyle again.",0,1764927983.0,tf2,3,0.25,False

So, first up, I was not expecting my last post to get literally any views so thank you! I’ve read every single comment and have tried to respond to ones that I can (my friend also has helped a bit with that too! Shout out to them) 

I’m gonna clear something’s up and also share ANOTHER experience T^T.

Clearing things up.

I have a physical disability in my knees that make me ineligible for military service. Along with ADHD, PTSD, Anxiety, Depression (formally diagnosed) and suspected Autism (working on a formal diagnosis) I had been planning for the last four-ish years to go into the Air Force before my disability diagnosis. 

I can’t believe I have to say thing seeing as I am on an Exmo Subreddit but I don’t really want to be preached at about how God made my body perfectly and I’m ruining it by being trans, those of you who have DM’d me with Bible verses are really gonna hate me more when you find out I’m not only trans but I still like men, aka I’m Gay.

And the advice about a job really has helped but due to my physical disability I’ve admittedly gained weight, I’m currently losing it and getting back to a healthy weight but, that being said I’ve been turned down by some promising jobs because I couldn't complete the tasks they needed because of my weight. I’m going to another interview this Monday so wish me luck!

Story time :3

Okay, so one thing of advice I kept on getting was to set up my own bank account my mom and dad can’t access. I needed to run down to the bank today to update my phone number on my account so, while I was down there I set one up! It was fast and the lady helping me was very patient with me and walked me through it ensuring me this new account would be registered to me, in my name, with nothing linking it to my other account or my parents. She helped me set up a student discount and assured me that it won’t be tax fraud and that it’s something that this bank offers that applies to everyone who is 18-21 years old.

I get it all set up, I’m feeling good, feeling like an adult and then my mom texts me.

“Hey, you okay? What’s taking so long?”

I panicked, so I told her a half truth 

“Setting up a new savings account, almost done, be home soon phone’s about to die.” 

Damn it. She’s going to notice when I get home the lack of a new savings account in my account linked with her. And I literally walked into the bank with my only dollar to set this account up. I fucked up. I left the text open-ended enough and I was still waiting for my new card to print that I had some time to think. I ran things over in my head over and over.

I decided I’d tell her the truth, just not in depth, that I originally went in to change my number but decided to add a new account but a mix up happened. I decided that I’d actually rather have a new account to separate my spending and to “be more responsible” (all true.) My first account (the one they could see) would be for spending Christmas, birthday, events, etc. and my new one would purely be untouched and for long term savings. 

All of it is true. I just left out the part that I felt better having this new card and almost wanted to switch the savings and checkings card that way they can’t track where I spend my money. And maybe I could get a coffee here or there and not feel guilty. 

 (Yes they do that, I once got yelled at for buying a white monster for my brother when I was 16, my brother was an adult, he is 12 years older than me, it was his birthday present..) 

When I get home, things go well. I stick to the plan, mom is actually proud of me for thinking about long term financial independence. So far so good. Then…

Mom: “So where’s your card? I got to update your information.” 

Me: “Why do you need to update it?”

Mom: “I just need to have the number so I can transfer you money if you need it.”

Me: “Yeah, but you can just put it into my other account and I can transfer it.”

Mom: “But maybe me and dad want to do it as a surprise.” 

Me awkwardly handing her my new card: “Okay..”

Mom: “And your routing number? And did you make a new pin?”

Me: “Well, I know you don’t need that, I’m just confused why you want this information? You don’t need it to transfer money..”

Mom: “Do you remember what happened to (brother), we had to go through legal processes and so much paperwork and so many lawyers that (brother) ended up in a lot of debt, if we had this information we would have stopped it.” 

My brother went to jail for a bit due to some bad charges, he is better now and his charges have been expunged. (He was drugged by an abusive ex and a whole lot of shit sent down) 

I felt that it was very manipulative and wrong for her to say, and she really drilled into me how bad it was for him that it happened. She went on to talk about how it messed up his life.

(This is the same brother who left the church mind you) 

She asked if she was a co-owner on it, I said no. She said she was glad and that it’s good for me to not lean on them anymore and she was proud of that but, at the same time she really drilled into me how she needed this information.

So… begrudgeingly I gave it to her. I felt defeated. I felt weak. I felt like I had a short victory all for nothing. 

At least she doesn’t have my password but at this point I don’t know what to do. I was so close to having more freedom but now I feel like that’s gone. I at least know she can’t view where I spend things, I also signed up for a feature with my bank that tells me if / when a device tries to sign into my account to view anything so I can stop it fast. 

Is there anything else I can do?

You know — jasmine, filter coffee, some aunties aggressively comparing gold rates, the usual.

But NO.

This was **Chennai’s version of a royal summit + Michelin-star buffet + Coachella + Tanjore palace tourism package** all mashed into one.

**The Family (aka Chennai’s own “royal lineage”)**

So apparently the groom’s family isn’t just rich. They’re in that category where their family WhatsApp group probably has its own CFO.

**Groom’s side:**  
Industrialists. Not the normal “we have a factory” type. The “we own half the industrial estate” type. The father walked around like he had copyright on the concept of air.

**Bride’s side:**  
Old-money Chettiar family with a house so huge that Google Maps still hasn’t fully mapped it. Their silver collection has its own insurance policy. Every auntie whispered:  
*“Pa… these people buy silver like we buy onions.”*

# Bride & Groom

**Groom:** Super chill guy. Works in fintech. The type who wears a ₹2 lakh sherwani and still says “bro, is there WiFi?” every 10 minutes.

**Bride:** A dentist who also runs a small baking business on the side. Imagine someone who can do a perfect root canal *and* bake macarons shaped like little elephants. Actual queen vibes.

# The Wedding Itself = Chennai x Royalty x Bollywood x NASA

I swear they hired the same event planner who does Dubai expos.

# 1. The Venue

It wasn’t a hall.  
It wasn’t a resort.  
It was basically a **temporary kingdom**.

A giant entrance arch with fresh flowers imported from *Kenya* (because apparently Indian jasmine is too mainstream). And I kid you not — they had a water fountain that synced to AR Rahman music.

# 2. The Mandap

Bro… the mandap looked like someone copy-pasted Thanjavur Palace into the middle of ECR.

Gold pillars.  
Silk drapes.  
Ceiling carved with motifs of every Hindu god plus two peacocks looking like they were judging my outfit.

# 3. The Food

There were **7 cuisines**.  
Seven.

* Chettinad
* Andhra
* Italian
* Japanese
* North Indian
* Vegan gluten-free section (because obviously)
* A live dessert counter where a man literally blow-torched your kunafa like a pyromaniac Michelin chef

There was even a *“low-carb counter”* for people pretending to diet at a 3,000-calorie event.

# 4. The Guests

Every uncle looked like he had at least two secret businesses.  
Every aunty wore enough diamonds to solve India’s GDP.

And the photographer… bro… he was treating guests like models:  
*""Sir one candid please.""*  
My candid was me eating sambar vadai like a raccoon.

# 5. The Drama (because where else?)

At one point, the AC went off for 4 minutes and three aunties immediately said:  
*""Ayyo this hall is useless only.""*  
— even though it was literally a hall built for ministers.

Then there was ONE kid who tripped on the flower aisle and the collective gasp from the aunties could have registered on the Richter scale. So after all the extravaganza, someone casually says: \*""You know ah, this match was fixed through Elite Matrimony.""\*HUH??? Because apparently it’s so exclusive that even their profiles look like NDAs.

Anyway, after the pheras, the fireworks, the 700-photo photoshoot, and the emotional uncles wiping non-existent tears, I went home with:

* a flower strand
* two return gifts
* mild heatstroke

10/10 would attend again just for the dessert counter.",5,1764927468.0,wedding,1,1.0,False

1peqtlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_startfresh332/comments/1peqtlt/clean_and_welcoming_café_spaces_that_support/,Clean and Welcoming Café Spaces That Support Better Customer Experiences,"Cafés hold an important place in busy cities, serving as meeting points, workspace alternatives, and casual dining spots throughout the day. Because these environments experience constant foot traffic and frequent food handling, maintaining a high standard of cleanliness becomes essential for both customer comfort and operational efficiency. Many businesses turn to specialized [**Café Cleaning Services New York**](https://freshstartcommercialcleaningusa.com/services/restaurant-cleaning-new-york/) to help meet these expectations consistently. 

A café’s hygiene directly influences the safety and quality of the food and beverages being served. Spills near preparation counters, leftover crumbs on tables, and residue around coffee machines can accumulate quickly if not addressed regularly. When cleaning falls behind, these areas may harbor germs that pose health risks. Establishing a thorough cleaning system ensures that surfaces remain sanitary, equipment performs properly, and customers receive food in a safe environment. 

Cleanliness also shapes the atmosphere of a café more than many people might realize. Guests often notice the condition of countertops, display cases, floors, and seating areas within seconds of walking in. Dusty shelves or sticky surfaces can discourage customers from staying, even when the menu is strong. On the other hand, a well-maintained space creates a welcoming environment where guests feel comfortable working, socializing, or enjoying a meal. 

Another important consideration is the exterior of the café. Urban settings expose storefronts to dirt, weather buildup, food spills, and foot traffic that can make entrances look worn over time. Outdoor seating areas require frequent upkeeping. Many businesses rely on [**Power Washing Services NYC**](https://freshstartcommercialcleaningusa.com/services/pressure-washing-new-york/) to keep sidewalks, building fronts, and patio sections fresh and appealing. Regular power washing not only improves appearance but also helps remove residue that can create slippery surfaces. 

Behind the scenes, a clean café directly supports smoother operations for staff. Organized prep stations, disinfected equipment, and clutter-free pathways allow employees to work quickly and safely. During peak hours, these small efficiencies reduce the likelihood of delays and help maintain consistent service. Routine cleaning also extends the lifespan of major appliances, flooring, and ventilation systems by preventing dirt and grease buildup that can lead to wear or malfunction. 

Cafés must also meet local health guidelines, making compliance another key part of daily maintenance. Keeping up with industry standards can be challenging without a structured cleaning routine, especially during rush periods. Professional cleaning teams bring specialized tools, experience, and a deeper understanding of sanitation requirements. They are trained to identify overlooked areas such as under-counter spaces, baseboards, equipment edges, and high-touch zones, helping cafés stay aligned with inspection expectations. 

Customer loyalty is shaped by many small details, and cleanliness consistently ranks among the most influential. A tidy, well-cared-for environment makes guests feel valued and encourages repeat visits. For cafés in competitive neighborhoods, cleanliness becomes part of their identity and helps distinguish them in a crowded market. 

Fresh Start offers tailored cleaning support designed to help cafés maintain healthy, organized, and inviting spaces for both customers and staff.

These are in no particular order... separated by emojis that are totally unrelated to the storyline.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

One of my friends walks in wearing this absolutely stunning outfit. Like, movie scene level stunning. I immediately said, “Wow, you look incredible! Is that new?” She smiled and said, “Yeah, I’ve been really into abaya designs lately, this one’s from Alibaba.”

Now, you’d think that would be the end of the conversation, right? Compliment given, compliment received. Nope. That was apparently the trigger for a full-blown cultural fashion debate.

Within seconds, my other friend (who once watched half a documentary on sustainable fabrics and now considers herself an expert) jumped in like, “Actually, traditional design forms are being reimagined to challenge modern silhouettes.” Meanwhile, someone else was googling abaya history like we were about to present a TED Talk. I just wanted to drink my iced latte in peace.

Fast-forward 40 minutes, and somehow we’d gone from talking about abaya designs to debating whether fast fashion is ethical, how influencers affect local artisans, and whether you can ever own a cultural style. It was fascinating and also not what I signed up for when I said, “Cute outfit!”

By the time we were done, my coffee was room temperature, my brain was melted, and we’d decided to start a shared Pinterest board of culturally respectful fashion. (We have not opened it since.)

we have met, we have gone through my dogs quite minimal needs, he’s a pretty easy-going fella and I just really want a human around for him for the night that I’m away. Sorted. 

I’m wondering about his food for her overnight , and actually in general if she did a longer sit.

To sound weird, I’m not really a  ‘ food’ kind of person. my whole adult life never really had food in my house, in the way that people call it food. 
I basically live off snacks , and will rarely cook an actual meal.

I’ve bought things like milk for her for her coffee , because I don’t drink milk. Just in case she does and wants a morning coffee .

But I’m wondering what I should do, or what people generally do to accommodate a pet sitter food wise.

I’m assuming a normal person would have  ‘food’ and tell the sitter to help themselves? 

I’m happy to buy whatever is suggested , but I don’t know what she likes, or if she even cooks (because I’m sure there’s other weirdos like me) and I don’t want to buy a whole heap of random food just in case she might want it, that I will never use.

1peqqzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1peqqzh/locate_your_proxy_server_address_on_any_platform/,Locate your proxy server address on any platform,"A proxy server sits between your personal device and the wider internet, acting as a filter or gateway. It handles traffic on your behalf, which is useful for privacy, security, and accessing geo-locked content. While most users set it and forget it, there are times you need to get under the hood. Whether you are troubleshooting a connection failure, configuring a piece of software that doesn't auto-detect settings, or simply auditing your network security, knowing your proxy server address is vital.

This guide covers exactly how to find these details on all major operating systems and browsers.

Types of proxies you might encounter

Proxies generally function as intermediaries, but they come in different flavors depending on the use case. If you are configuring these for a company or personal scraping project, you are likely dealing with one of the following:

* **Datacenter proxies:** These are fast and cost-effective, often used for high-volume tasks.
* **Residential proxies:** These use IP addresses assigned to real devices, making them high-anonymity and perfect for scraping without getting blocked. **Decodo** is a strong contender here, offering ethically sourced IPs with precise targeting options.
* **Mobile proxies:** These route traffic through 3G/4G/5G networks. They are the hardest to detect.
* **Static residential (ISP) proxies:** These combine the speed of a datacenter with the legitimacy of a residential IP. For those looking for great value without the enterprise price tag, **IPRoyal** is a solid option to check out.

Why you need to find this address

You might go months without needing this information, but when you need it, it is usually urgent. **Troubleshooting connectivity issues** is the most common reason. If your internet works on your phone but not your laptop, a stuck proxy setting could be the culprit.

Software configuration is another big one. Some legacy applications or specialized privacy tools (like torrent clients or strict VPNs) require you to manually input the **proxy IP and port**. Furthermore, if you are moving between a secure office network and a public coffee shop Wi-Fi, verifying your settings ensures you aren't leaking data or trying to route traffic through a server you can no longer access.

Find proxy settings on Windows

Windows 10 and 11 share a very similar structure for network settings.

**Using system settings**

1. Open the **Start menu** and select the gear icon for **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Network & Internet**.
3. On the left-hand sidebar (or bottom of the list in Windows 11), click on **Proxy**.
4. Here you will see a few sections. Look under **Manual proxy setup**. If a proxy is active, the **Address** and **Port** boxes will be filled in and the toggle will be set to On.

**Using command prompt** For a faster method that feels a bit more technical, you can use the command line.

1. Press the **Windows Key + R**, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
2. In the terminal, type `netsh winhttp show proxy` and press Enter.
3. If a system-wide proxy is set, it will display the server address and port right there.

**Windows 7** For older machines, the route is through the Control Panel. Go to **Control Panel > Internet Options > Connections tab**. Click on **LAN settings** at the bottom. You will see the proxy details under the ""Proxy server"" section.

Find proxy settings on macOS

Apple keeps network configurations fairly centralized.

1. Click the **Apple icon** in the top left and open **System Settings** (or System Preferences).
2. Select **Network**.
3. Click on the network service you are currently using (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and click **Details** or **Advanced**.
4. Select the **Proxies** tab.
5. You will see a list of protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS). If a box is checked, click on it. The **server address and port** will appear in the fields to the right.

Find proxy settings on mobile

Mobile devices usually handle proxies on a per-network basis. This means your proxy settings for your home Wi-Fi will be different from your work Wi-Fi.

**iPhone (iOS)**

1. Open **Settings** and tap **Wi-Fi**.
2. Tap the blue information icon **(i)** next to your connected network.
3. Scroll to the very bottom to the **HTTP Proxy** section.
4. If it says ""Manual,"" the server and port will be listed there. If it says ""Off,"" you are not using a proxy.

**Android**

1. Open **Settings** and go to **Network & internet** (or Connections).
2. Tap **Wi-Fi** and then the gear icon next to your current network.
3. You may need to tap **Advanced** or an ""Edit"" button depending on your phone manufacturer.
4. Look for the **Proxy** dropdown. If it is set to Manual, the hostname and port will be visible.

Browser specific settings

Most browsers simply piggyback off your computer's system settings, but there is one major exception.

**Chrome, Edge, and Safari** These browsers do not store their own proxy configurations.

* **Chrome/Edge:** Go to **Settings > System**. Click ""Open your computer’s proxy settings."" This redirects you to the Windows or macOS settings windows described above.
* **Safari:** Go to **Settings > Advanced**. Click ""Change Settings"" next to Proxies. This also opens the macOS Network settings.

**Mozilla Firefox** Firefox is unique because it can route traffic differently than the rest of your system.

1. Open Firefox and go to **Settings**.
2. Scroll to the bottom under **Network Settings** and click **Settings...**
3. Here you might find ""Use system proxy settings"" selected, or **Manual proxy configuration**. If it is manual, the HTTP and SOCKS proxy IP addresses will be listed here.

Troubleshooting common proxy errors

When your proxy configuration is wrong, you will usually get specific HTTP error codes. Understanding these can save you a lot of time.

* **407 Proxy Authentication Required:** This is the most common issue. It means the server exists, but it doesn't know who you are. You need to check your **username and password** credentials or add a proxy-authorization header if you are coding a scraper.
* **403 Forbidden:** The proxy is working, but it is not allowed to access the specific target website. This often happens if the proxy IP has been banned by the target. If you are using a provider like **Decodo**, try rotating your IP to a different residential address.
* **502 Bad Gateway / Gateway Timeout:** The proxy server tried to reach the website but didn't get a response in time. This is often a server-side issue, not necessarily a configuration error on your end.
* **Connection Refused:** This usually means the **port number** is wrong, or the proxy server itself is offline.

Summary

Finding your proxy server address isn't difficult once you know where to look. On mobile, it is always hiding behind the specific Wi-Fi network settings. On desktop, it is generally in the main network settings, with Firefox being the only browser that likes to do things its own way. Whether you are using high-end residential IPs or just setting up a local connection for testing, keeping your configuration accurate is the key to a stable internet experience.",1,1764926847.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The app is now **FREE** to download!

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

1peqnpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1peqnpi/5_reasons_why_nocode_backends_are_the_future/,5 Reasons Why No-Code Backends Are the Future,"A Short Story From the Startup Trenches Last month,   
  
a founder reached out to us with a familiar problem.   
  
He had an idea.   
A real one.   
The kind that makes you stop mid-coffee and think, “This could actually work.”   
  
But like most founders, he hit the same wall we all know too well:   
  
“I can’t afford a backend team right now.”   
“Development will take months.”   
“What if I build it and users don’t even want it?”   
  
He wasn’t stuck because of creativity.   
He was stuck because of… infrastructure.   
  
So instead of launching, he waited.   
And while he waited, his competitors didn’t.   
  
That’s when he discovered what many founders and teams are realizing today: ⭐ The Future of Building is No-Code Backends  
  
Here’s why — through his journey 👇

  
**1️⃣ Speed Became His Superpower**

Instead of spending 2–3 months building the backend, he connected his database, generated APIs, and tested everything…  
**in a single afternoon.**

Time-to-launch went from *quarterly roadmap* → *same-week shipping*.

**2️⃣ No More Dependency on Developers**

He didn’t have to chase developers, manage sprints, or rewrite documentation.

If he wanted a new endpoint?  
A small change in workflow?  
A new table in the database?

He did it himself — *without writing a single line of backend code.*

Freedom = Innovation.

**3️⃣ Costs Dropped Instantly**

No hiring a backend engineer.  
No long-term outsourcing.  
No revisions, no delays, no hidden maintenance.

He paid for what he used — and nothing more.

No-code backends don’t just save money…  
They save early-stage startups.



**4️⃣ He Iterated at Lightning Speed**

Users said:  
“Can we get Login with OTP?” → Done.  
“Can we filter these results?” → Done.  
“Can we get faster responses?” → Done.

Every change took minutes, not weeks.

When iteration becomes effortless,

product-market fit comes faster.

**5️⃣ He Finally Focused on What Mattered**

Not debugging.  
Not server errors.  
Not API version mismatches.

He focused on:

* Acquiring users
* Growing revenue
* Making the product better

The backend stopped being a burden.  
It became a *silent partner*.

💡 That Founder Shipped. And He’s Scaling Today.

Because he embraced the future:

**No-code backends.**

And this future is already here — powering founders, indie makers, agencies, and teams who want to move fast *without breaking their budget*.

🔧 At EazeMyAPI, we’re building this future.

So you spend less time building the backend - 

and more time building the business.

Industrialists. Not the normal “we have a factory” type. The “we own half the industrial estate” type. The father walked around like he had copyright on the concept of air.

**Bride’s side:**  
Old-money Chettiar family with a house so huge that Google Maps still hasn’t fully mapped it. Their silver collection has its own insurance policy. Every auntie whispered:  
*“Pa… these people buy silver like we buy onions.”*

# Bride & Groom

**Groom:** Super chill guy. Works in fintech. The type who wears a ₹2 lakh sherwani and still says “bro, is there WiFi?” every 10 minutes.

**Bride:** A dentist who also runs a small baking business on the side. Imagine someone who can do a perfect root canal *and* bake macarons shaped like little elephants. Actual queen vibes.

# The Wedding Itself = Chennai x Royalty x Bollywood x NASA

I swear they hired the same event planner who does Dubai expos.

# 1. The Venue

It wasn’t a hall.  
It wasn’t a resort.  
It was basically a **temporary kingdom**.

A giant entrance arch with fresh flowers imported from *Kenya* (because apparently Indian jasmine is too mainstream). And I kid you not — they had a water fountain that synced to AR Rahman music.

# 2. The Mandap

Bro… the mandap looked like someone copy-pasted Thanjavur Palace into the middle of ECR.

Gold pillars.  
Silk drapes.  
Ceiling carved with motifs of every Hindu god plus two peacocks looking like they were judging my outfit.

# 3. The Food

There were **7 cuisines**.  
Seven.

* Chettinad
* Andhra
* Italian
* Japanese
* North Indian
* Vegan gluten-free section (because obviously)
* A live dessert counter where a man literally blow-torched your kunafa like a pyromaniac Michelin chef

There was even a *“low-carb counter”* for people pretending to diet at a 3,000-calorie event.

# 4. The Guests

Every uncle looked like he had at least two secret businesses.  
Every aunty wore enough diamonds to solve India’s GDP.

And the photographer… bro… he was treating guests like models:  
*""Sir one candid please.""*  
My candid was me eating sambar vadai like a raccoon.

# 5. The Drama (because where else?)

At one point, the AC went off for 4 minutes and three aunties immediately said:  
*""Ayyo this hall is useless only.""*  
— even though it was literally a hall built for ministers.

Then there was ONE kid who tripped on the flower aisle and the collective gasp from the aunties could have registered on the Richter scale. So after all the extravaganza, someone casually says: *""You know ah, this match was fixed through Elite Matrimony.""*HUH??? Because apparently it’s so exclusive that even their profiles look like NDAs.

Anyway, after the pheras, the fireworks, the 700-photo photoshoot, and the emotional uncles wiping non-existent tears, I went home with:

* a flower strand
* two return gifts
* mild heatstroke

10/10 would attend again just for the dessert counter.",1,1764926181.0,IndianWeddings,1,0.67,False

1peqesx,https://www.reddit.com/r/femaletravels/comments/1peqesx/some_practical_daytoday_travel_advice_for/,Some practical day-to-day travel advice for (Northern) India,"I am finishing up a GAdventures 15-day tour of Northern India and have some tips that I learned. Most probably apply to other parts of India but I was in the north, in large cities and small villages. So here they are, in no particular order and rambling.

1. Most of the ***plugs I encountered were type D (three pinned).*** I had a type C plug adapter, the two-pinned type used in Europe, and that works too. Sometimes there will be a lock on the two pin sockets, so you can't plug things in. To get around this, turn off the switch to the plug and use a pen or something similar to push in on the third top hole. This unlocks the two bottom pin holes, so while keeping the pen in the socket you should be able to plug into the bottom two holes. Then remove the pen and turn on the socket. 

2. I underestimated ***how polluted India is.*** It is truly awful. Everyone in our tour group had continuous respiratory issues from the pollution. You can use a mask to help a little. I'm sure N95 is best but I just used a surgical mask. It gets visibly dirty after a day of use from the pollution. Not many people wear them but that's fine. Some in our group used them all the time. I used mine when traveling in open air tuktuks or when the pollution was particularly bad. I brought mine from home but you can buy masks in some pharmacies. 

3. ***Pharmacies*** are everywhere, and they will have cold and stomach medicine and antibiotics and maybe melatonin. Bigger pharmacy chains will be on a Google maps but it's hard to go more than a couple of blocks without seeing a tiny pharmacy, indicated with a red cross, that sells medicine. 

4. ***Horns are a constant*** in northern India. They are non-stop and loud and many will be going off at any point in time. It is incredibly noisy and chaotic. For sleeping I advise bringing a good pair of ear plugs. Related, ***trash is everywhere***, though Delhi is by far the worst in that regard.

5. I found ***cash to be much more useful than credit cards***, and used bank ATMs to withdraw money. Places that accept credit cards often will just take local, and not international, cards. Bigger hotels and tourist restaurants are the likeliest places to accept international credit cards. 

6. You want to ***keep a supply of ""small change"" on you*** for small purchases, though this can be hard. When you go to an ATM you will get 500 rupee notes, which aren't worth a huge amount by Western standards. Max ATM withdrawal is typically 10,000 rupees per transaction, but you can always end things and then insert your card again to start a new transaction. You will want to have 10s, 20s, and 50s on hand.

7. ***Bottled water is everywhere and cheap.*** Bisleri is a good and popular brand. As of late 2025, a half liter bottle is 10 rupees, a liter is 20, and 2 liters (which comes with a plastic carry handle) is 40. You can get little bags of snack mix for 10 to 20 rupees, sold everywhere. Fruit prices vary. I got three small bananas in a local village for 10 rupees, but in bigger cities it's one banana for that much. Mandarins and oranges can be about 40 rupees. Coffee is of varying quality I hear (I don't drink it myself). Sodas vary on size but the smallest bottle is like 20 rupees and a bigger can 40 rupees, but more expensive in larger cities and restaurants can charge much more. Coke was everywhere, but diet Coke or coke zero was sometimes hard to find. Marsala chai starts at 10 rupees. Toilets that aren't free are 10 rupees.

8. You won't be able to get a SIM card as a tourist, so ***use an esim or your carrier's international plan.***

9. You can use ***Uber in big cities*** and it's cheap. Don't expect nice cars. For a ***food delivery app, use Swiggy.*** Most apps require an Indian phone number to verify codes, but Swiggy can use Whatsapp (which you definitely want to have). You can order food and groceries in larger cities.

10. ***Tampons*** aren't too commonly used and may be harder to find. You can find menstrual pads of various brands at some pharmacies or general shops. I googled and looked at Reddit posts that reviewed the different brands, as they are different from home. If you want tampons, I think the easiest would be to use Swiggy in a bigger city. They pair with Instamart for grocery deliveries. It's also a lazy but convenient way to get junk food snacks (chocolate, chips, sodas, nuts, protein bars, etc). Delivery is fast and cheap. Oh, and condoms if you need them. 

11. ***Hotels and trains*** were not as bad as I feared based on reviews. Hotel rooms typically had hot water through a boiler you turned on 10 to 15 minutes in advance, fans, and clean beds. Maybe I lucked out but the train bathrooms were okay too, and western ones were available. I took an overnight train in 3AC class that was okay but a bit cramped. I wished I'd been in 2AC so I could sit up in the bunk. They provided sheets, pillows, and a blanket. I did find the seat you sleep on pretty uncomfortable, and I am never able to sleep on public transportation, but the others in my tour group got 4 or 5 hours of sleep in. 

12. I ***never had to use a squat toilet.*** They varied from Not Filthy to Sorta Clean. Toilet paper was rare. Soap sometimes rare. If you are in tourist areas I doubt it will be an issue. ",1,1764925511.0,femaletravels,1,1.0,False

1peq41p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mom/comments/1peq41p/am_i_a_bad_mom/,Am I a bad mom?,"Can someone please read this and tell me if I’m a bad mom. For context: I had my first baby on November 4th 2025. She is a month old today. On November 4th my grandmother went in for a routine surgery and unfortunately coded on the table and was immediately airlifted to another hospital and put on life support. My grandmother and I were very close. She unfortunately passed 6 days later while unresponsive on life support. After about 5 days after my grandmother passed away I started getting right side immense pain, after 2 trips to the hospital postpartum, I had gallstones and had to have my gallbladder removed. During all of this I have had the absolute rock of a mother who has helped me and my husband with my infant daughter while dealing with my medical issues and she has watched my daughter twice. (My mom and I are as close as we possibly can be. I trust her with my entire life and my daughter.)After my gallbladder was removed my husband and I stayed at my parents for an entire week to help us with our baby while everyone was helping take care of me and also my baby. I am now a week and 3 days post surgery and my husband and I have been so exhausted with little to no sleep and decided to take my mom up on her offer to watch our baby overnight so we can have a date night now that I’m feeling better.. We went to Costco, the mall to get our daughter some Christmas clothes, then we went to Applebees and a movie. After getting out of the movies… I received this text from my BESTFRIEND… I need someone to please tell me if I’m in the wrong here.

Hi, I’ve been thinking about how to approach this and no matter what way I try and go about it I think I need to just rip the bandaid off. I need to take a break from being your friend, you live in a world that is so far from reality and it just doesn’t align anywhere with where I’m at right now. I have honestly never heard of a newborn baby being away from their mom as much as S******* has been away from you. I understand being in the hospital, but everything else.. date nights, to go shopping, a few weeks ago when you said you guys needed “a solid 8-10 hours of sleep” and now again tonight so you guys can go to dinner and a movie? She’s barely a month old.. Being a mom to a new baby should encompass every moment of your life and it’s really hard to respect you when you post how much you love her and she’s your best friend and all of the things you post for clout but behind the scenes you are taking every opportunity to get a break. It is just so insulting to those of us who not only want to but have no choice but to be a full time mom regardless of the circumstance. In my opinion, there is no excuse why your baby at this age should ever be with somebody else for more than a few hours. Spending time with her dad or grandma so you can go get your nails done or get a coffee or run to the store, sure, but hours on end and overnight without either of her parents because you guys need a break? Already? That’s just so out of touch and odd. I understand it’s hard and you’re tired and tensions are high and yes, I told you it’s important to find time for yourself, but you are taking that to another level. You can’t just ship your kid off anytime you need a break. And then you complain to me that you feel like she doesn’t want you.. like I wonder why? She doesn’t even know that she’s not still a part of you and you keep making her other people‘s responsibility, I can’t even imagine how confusing that is for her and that makes me so sad. I honestly can’t say I know anyone who would even consider dropping off their 1 month old overnight just for shits and giggles, like that’s just so ridiculous and selfish and honestly to be blunt I have no respect for it. When you have a baby, it’s not about you anymore, I feel like you are so used to living in a world where it’s just constantly about you and that’s not the reality anymore. You and I are just very different, I can’t stand to be away from C*****, both times I was in the hospital I couldn’t wait to get home to her and the first thing you do when you get home is take her to your moms, your exact words were so you can “get an uninterrupted 8-10 hours of sleep”. How could you even focus on sleeping when your brand new baby isn’t with you, like be so for real??? That is so weird to me. We didn’t leave C***** alone with anyone else until she was 4 months old, and even now at almost 7 months I can’t imagine her staying the night somewhere unless either I’m with her or it’s an emergency, honestly it is just very strange behavior to me. I have given up my whole life to be that little girls mom, I dedicate every waking moment to her because I can’t imagine being present anywhere else. I have really tried hard to bite my tongue and not say anything because you have a habit of being so oblivious to the things you say and how your actions are perceived by everyone else, and usually I can give you the benefit of the doubt, but it’s a direct reflection on why you’ve lost so many friends in the last few years and I have been the one to put up with it for too long. I just can’t respect you right now when I have busted my ass day and night for almost 7 months to be the best mom I can be, A***** busting his ass at work working 60+ hours a week to provide so I can stay home most of the time, just to listen to you complain that you need a break and uninterrupted sleep after less than a month of being a mom. We aren’t living in the same world and I just need a break from you. I hope someday when you realize you aren’t the main character in everyone else’s life that you can reconcile some of the friendships that you’ve lost, but right now in this moment I can finally understand what pushed everyone away. I just need a break. I don’t want to talk it out, I’m just so exhausted of you right now, and I’d appreciate it if you keep my friends and family out of this as well, because it will get back to me if you do. I wish you the best of luck but for now I have to remove myself.",2,1764924385.0,Mom,3,1.0,False

1peq1k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1peq1k0/eli5_what_super_agent_stack_actually_does_simple/,ELI5: What Super Agent Stack Actually Does (Simple Breakdown),"\## Think of Super Agent Stack like this:



\*\*Traditional LLM Setup:\*\* You're managing a restaurant kitchen where you need to order ingredients (APIs) separately, keep them fresh in different fridges (Redis, Qdrant), and coordinate between multiple vendors. Chaos.



\*\*Super Agent Stack:\*\* One vendor delivers everything you need, organized and ready to use.



\---



\## What We Actually Do:



\*\*1️⃣ Give Your AI a Memory\*\* 



Like how you remember your friend's coffee preference, your AI remembers:

\- \*\*Session Memory:\*\* What happened earlier in \*this conversation\*

\- \*\*User Memory:\*\* What they told you \*last week\*

\- \*\*Global Memory:\*\* Common patterns from all users



\*\*2️⃣ Let It Use ANY Model\*\*



Want to use:

\- GPT-4 for complex tasks?

\- Claude for coding?

\- Llama/Mistral locally for privacy?



✅ All accessible through ONE API key. Switch between them instantly.



\*\*3️⃣ Ground Your AI in Reality (No Hallucinations)\*\*



Upload a PDF, document, or code file. Your AI searches it, finds the answer, and \*\*shows you where it came from\*\*.



Not: ""I think the budget is $50K""

But: ""According to page 3 of Q3-budget.pdf, the budget is $50K""



\*\*4️⃣ It's Drop-In Ready\*\*



If you use OpenAI SDK:



\`\`\`python

from openai import OpenAI



\# Before:

client = OpenAI(api\_key=""sk-..."")



\# After:

client = OpenAI(

api\_key=""sas-..."",

base\_url=""https://api.superagentstack.com""

)

\`\`\`



\*\*That's it.\*\* Your code works. Now with memory, RAG, and model flexibility.



\---



\## Real-World Example:



\*\*Scenario:\*\* You're building a customer support chatbot for your SaaS.



\*\*Without Super Agent Stack:\*\*

\- Spend 2 weeks setting up Pinecone for vectors

\- Spend 1 week setting up Redis for memory

\- Spend 3 days figuring out OpenAI API rate limits

\- Spend 2 weeks debugging why it hallucinates old information



\*\*With Super Agent Stack:\*\*

\- Upload your knowledge base (PDFs, docs)

\- Set base\_url and api\_key

\- Done. Your bot remembers users, doesn't hallucinate, and works.



\---



\## The Free Tier:



\*\*500K tokens/month = enough to:\*\*

\- Build and test your AI product

\- Validate your idea

\- Understand what works before paying



\---



\## Honest Take:



We're not anti-Redis, anti-Qdrant, or anti-OpenAI.



We just noticed that 90% of indie developers doing AI don't need to \*manually manage\* all that. They need to \*ship fast\*.



If you're a 100-person company with DevOps expertise? Manage your own infrastructure. That's fine.



But if you're solo or a small team? Your time is worth more than saving $20/month on infrastructure.

For context: I had my first baby on November 4th 2025. She is a month old today. On November 4th my grandmother went in for a routine surgery and unfortunately coded on the table and was immediately airlifted to another hospital and put on life support. My grandmother and I were very close. She unfortunately passed 6 days later while unresponsive on life support. After about 5 days after my grandmother passed away I started getting right side immense pain, after 2 trips to the hospital postpartum, I had gallstones and had to have my gallbladder removed. During all of this I have had the absolute rock of a mother who has helped me and my husband with my infant daughter while dealing with my medical issues and she has watched my daughter twice. (My mom and I are as close as we possibly can be. I trust her with my entire life and my daughter.)After my gallbladder was removed my husband and I stayed at my parents for an entire week to help us with our baby while everyone was helping take care of me and also my baby. I am now a week and 3 days post surgery and my husband and I have been so exhausted with little to no sleep and decided to take my mom up on her offer to watch our baby overnight so we can have a date night now that I’m feeling better.. We went to Costco, the mall to get our daughter some Christmas clothes, then we went to Applebees and a movie. After getting out of the movies… I received this text from my BESTFRIEND… I need someone to please tell me if I’m in the wrong here.

Hi, I’ve been thinking about how to approach this and no matter what way I try and go about it I think I need to just rip the bandaid off. I need to take a break from being your friend, you live in a world that is so far from reality and it just doesn’t align anywhere with where I’m at right now. I have honestly never heard of a newborn baby being away from their mom as much as S******* has been away from you. I understand being in the hospital, but everything else.. date nights, to go shopping, a few weeks ago when you said you guys needed “a solid 8-10 hours of sleep” and now again tonight so you guys can go to dinner and a movie? She’s barely a month old.. Being a mom to a new baby should encompass every moment of your life and it’s really hard to respect you when you post how much you love her and she’s your best friend and all of the things you post for clout but behind the scenes you are taking every opportunity to get a break. It is just so insulting to those of us who not only want to but have no choice but to be a full time mom regardless of the circumstance. In my opinion, there is no excuse why your baby at this age should ever be with somebody else for more than a few hours. Spending time with her dad or grandma so you can go get your nails done or get a coffee or run to the store, sure, but hours on end and overnight without either of her parents because you guys need a break? Already? That’s just so out of touch and odd. I understand it’s hard and you’re tired and tensions are high and yes, I told you it’s important to find time for yourself, but you are taking that to another level. You can’t just ship your kid off anytime you need a break. And then you complain to me that you feel like she doesn’t want you.. like I wonder why? She doesn’t even know that she’s not still a part of you and you keep making her other people‘s responsibility, I can’t even imagine how confusing that is for her and that makes me so sad. I honestly can’t say I know anyone who would even consider dropping off their 1 month old overnight just for shits and giggles, like that’s just so ridiculous and selfish and honestly to be blunt I have no respect for it. When you have a baby, it’s not about you anymore, I feel like you are so used to living in a world where it’s just constantly about you and that’s not the reality anymore. You and I are just very different, I can’t stand to be away from C*****, both times I was in the hospital I couldn’t wait to get home to her and the first thing you do when you get home is take her to your moms, your exact words were so you can “get an uninterrupted 8-10 hours of sleep”. How could you even focus on sleeping when your brand new baby isn’t with you, like be so for real??? That is so weird to me. We didn’t leave C***** alone with anyone else until she was 4 months old, and even now at almost 7 months I can’t imagine her staying the night somewhere unless either I’m with her or it’s an emergency, honestly it is just very strange behavior to me. I have given up my whole life to be that little girls mom, I dedicate every waking moment to her because I can’t imagine being present anywhere else. I have really tried hard to bite my tongue and not say anything because you have a habit of being so oblivious to the things you say and how your actions are perceived by everyone else, and usually I can give you the benefit of the doubt, but it’s a direct reflection on why you’ve lost so many friends in the last few years and I have been the one to put up with it for too long. I just can’t respect you right now when I have busted my ass day and night for almost 7 months to be the best mom I can be, A***** busting his ass at work working 60+ hours a week to provide so I can stay home most of the time, just to listen to you complain that you need a break and uninterrupted sleep after less than a month of being a mom. We aren’t living in the same world and I just need a break from you. I hope someday when you realize you aren’t the main character in everyone else’s life that you can reconcile some of the friendships that you’ve lost, but right now in this moment I can finally understand what pushed everyone away. I just need a break. I don’t want to talk it out, I’m just so exhausted of you right now, and I’d appreciate it if you keep my friends and family out of this as well, because it will get back to me if you do.

1peq0hw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1peq0hw,Scammers,"Mods please delete if not allowed!

I’m trying to make as many people as possible aware.  There are multiple people using pictures of my golden retriever puppy acting like she’s for sale scamming people thousands of dollars. the fbi is now involved and wants me to spread the word to the scammers to stop because they’re gonna get charged and arrested. 

it’s so frustrating. My puppy does have a following of like 75,000 followers of all platforms, but it’s no excuse for people to use her pictures to scam. 

I really just want as many eyes on this as possible . If you see my puppy, August is her name posted anywhere that says she’s for sale or anything like that please DM me. 

Also, please look out for yourselves too because there’s so many puppies being used as ponds for scams . 

I posted some pictures of her as a young puppy so you can see . The picture of her with the black couch in the background is the most common used for the scammers of her.

Also, it’s not just money they’re scamming a lot of the scammers sent this girl an address to go to and she almost went . I looked up the address and it’s a sketchy abandoned storage unit thing it’s so weird. 

Also, in general, please if you’re looking for a puppy . Do not send money until you either physically see the puppy or go on a live video chat. Also do not meet up with a breeder to see a puppy until you have a video chat with them because there’s so many bad people in this world. And this is just made me so aware on the topic.

I posted for my followers to see, but there’s like 1 million people in here so if you guys can be on the lookout as well .

Honest review + how to fit it into your trip,"https://preview.redd.it/lrrkdhlwkc5g1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ce689b5cbe6a55abe0e475fbe7f21e86f052773

If you’re heading to York and wondering if the National Railway Museum is actually worth the time, short answer: yes. Longer answer: yes, especially if you like big indoor spaces, shiny engines and free entry. 🚂

Full guide here if you want the deep dive:  
[https://thetraveltinker.com/christmas/how-to-visit-the-national-railway-museum/](https://thetraveltinker.com/christmas/how-to-visit-the-national-railway-museum/)

# Why I keep going back

The National Railway Museum is genuinely my favourite thing to do in York. I always tell myself I’ll “just pop in for an hour”, then three hours later I’m still wandering around with a coffee, ogling Mallard and being distracted by some little detail on a carriage door.

It works for:

* Train nerds
* People who are *not* train nerds but like interesting stuff
* Families on a rainy day
* City-breakers who want something indoors and low stress

And the best bit: **general entry is free**. Donations are encouraged, but you are not handing over £25 a head just to get through the door.

# Quick basics

* **Location:** Behind York Station, about a 10 minute walk
* **Opening times:** Usually 10.00–17.00, last entry around 16.30
* **Closed:** 24–26 December
* **Cost:** Free entry, donations welcome; Wonderlab and some extras are paid
* **Typical visit length:**
   * Quick look: 1–1.5 hours
   * Standard visit: 2–3 hours
   * Deep dive: 4+ hours if you are really into it

If you are visiting at Christmas or in school holidays, it is worth checking current times and grabbing a free timed ticket in advance.

# What it actually feels like inside

The first hall feels like a cathedral built for engines. Giant steam locomotives, high ceilings, walkways so you can look down on them, people standing there doing the “I knew it was big but not *that* big” face.

You have two main areas:

* **Great Hall:** Big-name engines, speed records, high-speed rail, the flashy stuff
* **Station Hall:** Set up like an old station, with platforms, luggage, posters and royal carriages

It is busy and chatty rather than quiet and reverent. Think excited kids, the hum of families, lots of “look at that one!” moments.

# Highlights you probably don’t want to miss

If you are short on time, I’d make sure you at least see:

* **Mallard** – still the world’s fastest steam locomotive, and very photogenic
* **Duchess of Hamilton** – a streamlined beast that looks like art as much as engineering
* **Shinkansen bullet train car** – rare to see outside Japan
* **Royal carriages** – Station Hall has some beautifully done royal and VIP coaches

If you manage those and still have energy, you can happily just wander.

# With kids: realistic expectations

This is one of the better family options in York because:

* It is huge and indoors
* There is loads to *look* at even if they do not read a single sign
* There are decent toilets and baby-changing facilities
* Wonderlab gives them proper hands-on science and engineering stuff

The flip side is:

* It can get loud and echoey on wet weekends and in school holidays
* Smaller kids might top out at 60–90 minutes in the main halls before needing a proper break

Plan around natural pauses: engines, snack, more engines, lunch, Wonderlab, shop. Trying to march everyone around every display is usually how the meltdowns start.

# Tickets, Wonderlab & crowds

* **Entry:** Free, donations welcome
* **Wonderlab:** Paid, from about £9.90 per person, timed slots
* **Most days:** You can walk up without booking
* **Busy times:** School holidays, rainy Saturdays, Christmas markets

If you are going in December or over a school break, treat free timed tickets as a “don’t risk it” step, especially if you are travelling in just for the day.

# Food, coffee and breaks ☕

Food is standard big-attraction fare: hot mains, kids’ lunchboxes, soup, sandwiches, cake. Prices are roughly:

* £10–£15 for a hot main
* £5–£7 for a sandwich or kids’ box
* £3–£4 for coffee or cake

You can bring your own food and use picnic areas, which is a huge win for families and budget travellers. There is also a fancy afternoon tea in a restored carriage if you want something a bit extra and are happy to book ahead.

# Accessibility & logistics

Short version: the museum is pretty good on accessibility.

* Step-free routes, lifts and ramps between main areas
* Wheelchairs to borrow from the welcome desk
* Accessible toilets and baby-changing
* Ear defenders if noise is a thing
* Lockers for bulky bags and luggage

Quietest times are usually term-time weekdays, especially early or later in the afternoon.

# How to fit it into a York day

A few easy combos that work well:

* Museum + York city walls
* Museum + York Minster + the Shambles
* Museum + Clifford’s Tower / York Castle Museum
* In winter: Museum sandwiched between Christmas markets and evening lights

Because it is right by the station, it is ideal for:

* Killing time before a later train
* A key stop on a York day trip
* A “first or last” stop on a longer Yorkshire trip

# TL;DR

* Free entry, close to the station, huge engines, good for kids, easy to fit into a York day
* 2–3 hours is a sweet spot for most people
* Book a free timed ticket and Wonderlab during busy periods
* Very solid rainy-day or winter activity, especially around Christmas 🎄

I jumped out of bed and opened the window to let in fresh air. While brushing my teeth, I noticed the silence, usually my neighborhood is crowded with people leaving for work. After dressing and drinking my bitter coffee, I went outside. Even though I wasn’t working today, I liked keeping my routine of early walks in the late summer coldness. But something felt… different.

Streetlights were off, the sun hadn’t risen, and no one seemed to be around. The trees looked like creatures ready to harm me if getting close. The cold wind swirling around me sent shivers down my spine. I felt watched. In my mind, people stood still in their houses, following me with dead eyes. I gagged at the thought but tried to stay calm.

I reached the end of the street, facing the park with the lake where I usually read. The wind had stopped, yet the swing in the children’s area was still swaying… as if someone had just been there. I approached the lake and stared at the dark water, perfectly still like a mirror. My reflection was barely recognizable. The clouds hid the sun, letting only a small wave of light to win the battle. I still felt watched. Turning to go back, I froze.

A person stood by the benches near the park exit. A dark, still silhouette, barely human. Its body faced me, but its head was turned 180 degrees. “Hello?!” I shouted. Seconds later, it repeated in my voice: “Hello?!”

I screamed; it screamed. I stepped back; it stepped forward. It moved closer so slowly it seemed unreal, like a glitch in time. I couldn’t tell if I imagined it, but the distance was getting shorter.

Terrified, I ran, hearing my own breathing and steps behind me, perfectly imitated. I reached my street and stopped. Everything was silent. The sun was up, but the atmosphere remained unnerving. Houses revealed people standing still in windows, staring at me… but the eyes were missing!

My chest started to burn, and I felt to the ground. Blood was falling from my chest. I watched behind to see the person from the park… it was me. I was that person. The doppelgänger was facing me eyeless and smiling. Its mouth was covered in blood eating something. In an instant, it attacked me. I felt on my back and jumped right at it ready to fight... only to wake up in my bed sweating and hardly breathing.

The alarm was going crazy. 6 AM. Why was I so shaken? I couldn’t remember the dream, but my chest and head hurt. I jumped up, opened the window, then went to the bathroom. As I saw my reflection, I froze. The back of my head stared at me from the mirror, twisted 180 degrees. Somehow… I knew it was smiling… but this time I’m not dreaming…",2,1764923836.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I had been driving back into Charlotte after visiting a friend in Gastonia, and the sky had that heavy, bruised look that tells you a storm is coming but hasn’t decided when to hit. I pulled into a small diner off Wilkinson Boulevard. It wasn’t one I had ever noticed before even though I must have driven past it a hundred times. The sign flickered like it was trying to stay alive.

Inside, it was warmer than I expected. A couple of truckers were finishing up their meals, and the place smelled like strong coffee and old vinyl seats. I sat at the counter and ordered a refill to keep myself awake for the last stretch home.

While I waited, an older man came in. He looked soaked even though the rain still hadn’t started. He sat a few stools down from me and kept glancing toward the windows like he was expecting someone to arrive with the storm. I didn’t think much of it until he suddenly asked if anyone else could feel the pressure dropping. The truckers ignored him. The waitress gave him that patient smile people give to familiar regulars who say strange things.

He turned to me like he wanted acknowledgment from someone neutral. I told him the air did feel a little heavier. That seemed to open a door. He told me he had lived in Charlotte his whole life, long enough to sense when the weather wasn’t acting like normal weather. He said something was off tonight. Not dangerous exactly, just off. Like the storm wasn’t bringing wind and rain but bringing something else with it.

Before I could respond, the power flickered. All of us looked up at the same moment. The lights steadied. Then the rain finally started, first as a patter and then as a steady roar hitting the roof hard enough to drown out the clatter of dishes.

What made everyone fall silent was the sound that followed. It wasn’t thunder. It wasn’t mechanical. It sounded almost like something large exhaling right outside the diner. The truckers stared at each other. The waitress froze. I felt it more than heard it, like the air shifted in my chest.

When it stopped, the older man quietly said that sometimes storms bring things with them and sometimes they take things away. No one spoke after that. We sat in this strange, shared silence until the rain eased and the lights settled back into their normal hum.

I paid, left a tip, and hurried out into the damp air. The diner looked completely ordinary from the outside again. When I drove home, I kept thinking about what the man had said, especially because the storm ended quicker than expected and felt strangely calm afterward.

I tried to find that diner again the next day because I wanted to know if anyone else had felt what I felt. I drove up and down the same stretch of road three times. The diner wasn’t there. Not under a new name. Not boarded up. Not torn down. It was just gone like it had never existed.

I still don’t know what that sound was or why the man seemed to expect it. All I know is that I wasn’t the only one who heard it, and for one strange hour inside a flickering diner, everyone else knew something was off too.",0,1764923278.0,AskLawyers,1,0.5,False

I’m struggling to dial in my Bialetti Venus 4-cup on an IKEA induction stove using a 1Zpresso J-Ultra and a dark 80% Robusta blend.

My setup:
- Venus 4T (stainless steel)
- 1Zpresso J-Ultra
- 22 g coffee
- induction level: usually 6–7/9
- Water preheated to near-boiling

My issue:
- With higher heat → early start, harsh/burnt taste, leftover water in bottom.
- With lower heat → very late first drops (often 1:30–2:00), flow gets frothy, taste still bitter.
- Grind size between 140–200 clicks doesn’t give consistent results.

What I want to know:
- What’s the ideal timing for first drops + finish on a Venus on induction?
- What grind range works for you on a J-Ultra with moka?
- Is late flow a sign of too fine, too coarse, or wrong heat?
- Better to use small or medium induction zone for the Venus?
- Why does leftover water happen even when the coffee tastes burnt?

Any advice from people using induction + Venus + J-Ultra would be super helpful. Thanks!",3,1764923179.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

You know, the kind who wakes up early, drinks a cute coffee, and writes 2,000 words by noon.

Reality: I wrote… maybe 200 words? Over three days?  
But honestly, I’m not even mad about it.

I stayed in one of the big beachfront resorts along Sanya Bay, the Mangrove Tree Resort World Sanya Bay cluster (it’s huge, has its own ecosystem). I’d planned to use the balcony as my “writing office,” but every time I sat down, something distracted me. First it was the weather, then it was people doing morning exercise on the promenade, then it was literally just me zoning out.

But traveling alone does something to your brain in a good way. I ended up journaling a lot, not polished stuff, just thoughts, small observations, random lines that probably won’t make it into any actual blog post… but felt good to write down anyway. Sometimes I think solo travel is less about seeing things and more about finally hearing your own thoughts without interruption.

I’m curious, for those of you who write while traveling:  
Do you have a routine, or do you just accept that travel writing is mostly “notes first, real writing later”?  
I keep telling myself I’ll figure out a system, but maybe this is the system.

**Feeling Stiff After 50? 🧘‍♀️ Reclaim Your Mobility in 30 Days (Simple Stretches, Big Results!)**

Hey RetirementReady friends! 👋

Anyone else wake up some mornings feeling like they're auditioning for the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz? 😂 I know I do! That creaky-knee, stiff-back feeling can be a real drag, especially when you're trying to enjoy these golden years. But guess what? It doesn't *have* to be this way.

I've been experimenting lately, and I wanted to share some seriously easy stretches that have made a *huge* difference in how I feel each day. We're talking about things you can do while you're waiting for your coffee to brew!

So, if you're ready to ditch the stiffness and embrace a little more pep in your step, check these out:

*   **Morning Wake-Up Stretch:** Reach for the sky! Seriously, just a simple overhead stretch first thing in the morning can work wonders. Imagine you're pulling down sunshine and energy. Corny? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely!
*   **Chair Yoga Hero:** You don't need to be a contortionist. Gentle twists and forward folds while sitting in a chair are amazing for loosening up your back and hips. YouTube is your friend here; so many easy routines!
*   **Calf Raises While Waiting:** Waiting for the kettle to boil? Do some calf raises! Strengthens your ankles, improves circulation, and it's so sneaky you barely notice you're exercising. Win-win!
*   **Shoulder Rolls & Neck Stretches:** Desk job got you hunched over? These are life savers! Simple shoulder rolls forward and backward, and gentle neck stretches (ear to shoulder, chin to chest) can release so much tension.
*   **Walk it Out:** Just walking around the block counts. It's not a marathon, it's a lifestyle! Even 10-15 minutes can do wonders.

Are these groundbreaking, earth-shattering exercises? Nah. But are they *effective*? Absolutely. The key is consistency. Even a few minutes a day can make a HUGE difference over time.

Remember that feeling when you could bend over and tie your shoes without making a grunt sound? 😉 We can get back to something closer to that!

Want to dig a little deeper? We believe in strongest people, so we also found this free guide on some yoga and workout resources that are great for beginners or anyone looking to add a little something extra to their routine.
