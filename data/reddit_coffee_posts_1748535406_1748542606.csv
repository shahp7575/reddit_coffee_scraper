It was almost Halloween. Leafless tree branches swayed in the crisp breeze. The grey overcast sky hinted at yet another day of rain. Yellow-grey cornstalks flitted past and dead leaves scattered as the big, brown Buick carried us down the empty country road.

I looked forward to seeing Granny, even if she would be working most of the time I was staying with her. Grandpa agreed to watch me during the daytime. He received a stipend from a back injury he received in the army. It wasn’t much, but between the monthly check and Granny working it was enough. He always enjoyed the company. He would tell me stories about his time in the army and he knew the funniest jokes I ever heard. When he did his daily chores like cleaning the house, he let me explore the empty fields and small woods near their house. I looked forward to trying to find arrowheads, playing on hay bales, climbing trees… Maybe not that last one.

The only downside to my visit was I had to spend it with my cousin, Kasey. My grandparents became her legal guardians after her mom left. Mom and dad never explained where she went. I always worried she might have gone to jail or ended up like those people on Unsolved Mysteries. I might have felt sorry for Kasey if she didn’t bully me whenever the adults weren’t around.

“We’re only going to be gone three days for this business retreat, so I expect you to behave yourself.” Dad looked at me in the rearview mirror. “I don’t want you in the hospital again.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll be good.”

Mom turned in her seat to face me. “If you’re a good boy, maybe we’ll bring you back a present for good behavior. You’ll make sure he’s good, won’t you Teddy?” She held my stuffed bear and made him nod his head like a puppet. I was old enough to know Teddy wasn’t doing it himself, but I played along.

“Teddy gets a present too, right? For good bear-haviour?”

Mom smiled before turning around. “Of course, sweetie.”

The once smooth, quiet ride suddenly became rough and loud as dad’s car transitioned from pavement to the dirt and gravel leading the rest of the way to my grandparents’ house. Granny would take me on long walks down this stretch of road, and I would look for little round rocks she called “Indian Beads”. I showed some to my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Smith and she told me they were actually fossils from a prehistoric plant.

As we came to a stop at a four-way intersection I noticed the abandoned house on the corner. It was the only neighboring house to my grandparents for miles. Most of the year it was completely hidden from view by the trees and overgrown vines covering the chain link fence. Even now, after many of the leaves had fallen, I couldn’t distinguish much other than the chipping paint and wrap-around porch. A few windows on the upper floor peered over the trees, their screens torn and shutters unsecured.

“Somebody really ought to fix that place up.” Mom said.

“Too late for that,” Dad said. “The roof is caved in. It’s not safe.”

“That’s a shame. It must be over a hundred years old.”

After the fence row to the abandoned house, an empty field came into view. It probably belonged to whoever owned the house, but the only thing that grew in it were clusters of Indiangrass, cattails, and most notably, a massive oak tree in the center of the field. It was so big two grown-ups couldn’t reach all the way around it. Several of the limbs were low enough I could reach them without any help. I nearly forgot all the fun we had playing in this field when I realized my grandparents’ house was coming into view.

Grandpa was smoking a cigarette on the front porch as we pulled up. He was jolted from some reverie as Maggie, the black lab shot up and barked, wagging her tail. The car wasn’t even parked before I bolted out the door.

“Grandpa!” I ran to hug him. I nearly knocked him over. He laughed as he steadied himself on the porch railing. A tube of grey cinders fell from the tip of his cigarette as he laughed.

“What are they feeding you, Bucko? You get bigger every time I see you.”

I shrugged, and he let out another loud laugh. “You know what? I got some cartoons recorded for you!”

“Really?” We only got local channels at my house. The only cartoons were the ones on PBS, and that was only when they weren’t broadcasting boring home repair shows.

He smiled. “Your grandma left the videotapes next to the TV for you.”

Mom and Dad came up to the porch, Dad with the suitcase, Mom with Teddy. Grandpa bent down to whisper something to me. “I hid something for you under your pillow.”

“Really? What is it?”

“Don’t you spoil the boy, dad,” Mom handed me Teddy.

“Spoil him? It’s Halloween isn’t it Johnny?”

“Uh-Huh!”

“Well, we hate to drop him off and run, but we do need to get going.” My dad looked at his watch. “Johnny, you behave now.”

“I will.”

I hugged my parents goodbye. They waved as they backed out of the driveway and pulled onto the road. The big brown car slowly vanished in a cloud of dust. I picked up my luggage and went inside.

“I’ll be in there in a few minutes,” Grandpa said, settling into the lawn chair and sipping his coffee. “I just want to finish this newspaper article.”

I walked through the living room and saw the VHS tapes just like grandpa said. One of the labels read “Speed Racer”. I couldn’t wait to watch them. When I got to the guest bedroom, I set my suitcase on the floor next to the bunk bed. Kasey always slept in the top bunk which left me on the bottom. I set Teddy down and reached under the pillow. To my surprise there was nothing. Confused, I moved the pillow and found the spot underneath was bare. I looked under the bed thinking maybe whatever Grandpa left for me had fallen on the floor.

“Looking for this?” Kasey was hanging upside down from the top bunk. She dangled a bag of assorted candy while biting off a piece of taffy.

“Hey! Grandpa said that was supposed to be for me!”

“Not anymore.” She chomped the sticky mess in her mouth between words. A few tootsie rolls fell out of the bag as she rummaged for something else.

“Oh, you can have those.” She grimaced. “I don’t like those anyway.”

I picked up the pieces of candy from the floor and put them on the bottom bunk.

“They’re better than nothing,” I thought, as I set Teddy on top of the pillow.

“Why couldn’t you just go with your parents?” Kasey was scowling, still upside down.

“They’re going on a business trip,” I said. “Kids aren’t allowed.”

“Whatever,” Kasey said, disappearing over the edge of the bed. I wondered if Kasey was going to be this way the entirety of my stay. No, she couldn’t be. Not with the grown-ups around. Even when they weren’t she could be alright sometimes. Maggie’s barking from the porch interrupted the thought. From the window next to the bunk bed, I saw Granny’s car pulling up the driveway and into the lean-to carport behind the house. I ran through the kitchen and out the back door to meet her. Kasey shoved me aside as she rushed past me into the carport.

“Granny, Granny! You’ll never guess what I did at school today!”

“I’m sure it was wonderful sweetheart.” Granny fumbled an unlit cigarette to her lips.

“Hi, Granny!”

“Well, hi there, Johnny!” Granny hugged me. “Are you hungry for some cheeseburgers?”

“You make the best cheeseburgers in the world, Granny.” She smiled as I said this and slammed the back door shut behind us. It was an old door, possibly part of the house’s original construction. The latch didn’t work most of the time, and there was about an inch between the bottom of the door and the threshold. I remembered how scared I was last summer when I spent the night. I could see coyotes’ feet under the door as they walked through the carport. Occasionally, one would bump the door and it would open slightly, only to be stopped by the chain holding it shut. It was terrifying to see one of the wild dogs’ muzzles through the small gap as they howled.

“Damn this old door.” Granny slammed it again two more times before kicking a wooden wedge under it to keep it shut. The chain jangled as she fastened it shut. Turning around, I could see her look of exhaustion give way to anger as she looked over the messy kitchen.

“Daniel Lee!” Grandpa hurried to his feet and ambled inside, the screen door slamming behind him.

“Why didn’t you do anything while I was gone today? This place is a wreck!”

“I did plenty while you were gone, woman!”

“Oh, like the dishes?” She gestured to the overflowing sink of dirty cups and plates.

“I had to pace myself, so I took out the trash, emptied the ash-trays, checked the mail, made some coffee…”

“And then sat around listening to music and watching the weather channel.”

“Don’t be mad Granny,” I said. “He has a bad back.”

“I know sweetie.” Granny sighed. “Why don’t you and Kasey go outside and play?”

After dinner, Granny took us to the field with the oak tree. Kasey and I used sticks we found like swords, slashing through the occasional cluster of tall grass. You couldn’t tell from the road, but trash littered the field, smashed beer cans, worn-out clothes, and who knew what else. Kasey and I prodded at a large black bag, ripping at the seams.

“Stay out of that, kids! You don’t know where it came from or what it is,” Granny said as she lit another cigarette.

Kasey and I bolted off ahead, “fighting” other imaginary pirates until we came to the oak tree. We ran around it, played tag under it, and swung from the low-hanging branches. Kasey even helped me reach some stray acorns from a branch I couldn’t reach. I was a bit nervous, climbing. When I broke my arm last summer, Kasey and I were trying to get her kite out of the spruce tree in the front yard. This felt eerily similar, but I got down with no trouble. We divided the acorns between ourselves and pretended they were doubloons. Kasey could be alright, at times like this. Neither of us had siblings and it was fun having someone to play with. I had to admit, even if she was terrible sometimes, Kasey could still be a lot of fun.

“Eww,” Kasey said pointing between a couple of the tree’s exposed roots. “What’s that?”

“What is it Kasey?” Granny looked down from the clouds she was looking at.

“It’s moving,” Kasey said, pointing.

A clump of ladybugs the size of a football crawled around and over top of each other. I couldn’t believe we missed it when we were playing our game of tag. I had no idea why these ladybugs were doing this. I wondered if Mrs. Smith would know. She knew about lots of things.

“They must be huddling together to stay warm,” Granny said. She turned her head upward to the darkening sky as thunder rumbled in the distance.

“Come on, you two. It sounds like rain is on the way.”

“Aww, Granny! Can’t we stay a little longer? We’re still trying to find the X where the treasure is.” Kasey pouted as she said this.

“Kasey,” Granny said with a stern look on her face.

“Come on, Johnny! Let’s race back to the house.”

“O.K.” I ran as fast as I could after her, but it was no use. Kasey was taller than me and a faster runner. I could barely see her magenta jacket between the sporadic growths of grass and the odd bush. Finally, she was out of sight. I gave up and tried to catch my breath. The distant rumble of thunder became louder as I walked the rest of the way back to the house.

Granny made us take baths before we went to the living room to watch TV. I forgot to pack my pajamas, so Granny gave me one of Kasey’s old ones to wear. They were red flannel with a zipper and built-in feet. Ky’s pajamas were almost identical, just bigger. Granny thought us wearing matching outfits would make a great picture. She snapped one of us on the couch with her polaroid. Granny had to get up early, so she couldn’t stay up with us long.

“Don’t stay up too late.” She said, hugging us goodnight. Kasey got up and left the room. I decided to get one of the VHS tapes ready. I checked the cartoon channels, but nothing good seemed to be on. I just started the “Speed Racer” tape when Kasey plopped down on the couch with a bowl of popcorn. I reached for a handful when she jerked the bowl out of my reach.

“Don’t wipe your hands on my pajamas.” She gestured to my borrowed outfit.

“I wasn’t going to.”

“Good. Because they’re mine.” I could already hear my grandparents snoring in the small house. I tried to enjoy the cartoon, despite realizing Kasey now had free reign to torment me as much as she liked. She made fun of how the people’s lips didn’t match what they were saying. She mocked the characters and made me wish I had just gone to bed. Between her comments and the howling wind outside I could barely focus. We only finished one episode when I decided to go to bed. I could always take the tapes home and enjoy them there.

“At least she won’t be able to bother me while I sleep,” I thought.

I was wrong. The overcast, rumbling skies from earlier had given way to a thunderstorm. Lightning flashed against the skeletal tree branches out the window and I held Teddy tight. Kasey’s long black hair hung from her upside-down head as she peered down from the top bunk. Her pale face looked at me in the dark.

“I bet you don’t know about the witch that lives in those woods.” She pointed at the woods behind the house.

“There aren’t any witches around here.”

“Are so! Kathy Connors showed me a book all about them at school.”

“Goosebumps are just made-up stories.”

“It wasn’t a Goosebumps book, stupid. It was about a town nearby with a bunch of witches. They were caught casting spells and making sacrifices in the woods. The townspeople found them after hearing the cries of children they were killing.”

I didn’t say anything. I just shuddered at the thought.

“Then,” Kasey continued, “a bunch of angry villagers chased them through the woods until they caught and executed every witch but one. She escaped and was seen flying on her broomstick in the night sky. She hovered over the gallows and said she would avenge the death of the other witches in her coven.”

“Stop making things up. None of that’s true.” I shuddered.

“It is true. It was in that book. It said bad things happened to the people who tried capturing her. Their crops didn’t grow, their animals died, their children vanished without a trace. They never found her, and she still haunts the woods to this very day.”

I held Teddy tight as thunder clapped and wind raged outside. I couldn’t wait for this visit to my grandparents to end.

Birds scattered from behind a bush as we ran through the empty field. The thunderstorm of the previous evening had given way to a crisp, foggy morning. We found stick swords and decided to pick up our game of pirates from the night before. Once we got through the overgrown fence row, however, our attention was immediately diverted to the oak tree. It had fallen. We looked at each other before throwing down our sticks and running to see what happened. Granny told us the tree was over 200 years old, I couldn’t believe it collapsed. I gasped for air as I tried keeping up with Kasey. Without the tree sticking up in the center of the field, I realized how easily I could get lost. Most of the tufts of grass were taller than I was. Besides a few trees in the fence row, nothing else was visible. Kasey was no help. She ran so far ahead I could barely catch a glimpse of her magenta jacked as I rounded a cluster of grass before she would disappear behind the thick fog and foliage.

My lungs burned and my throat was hoarse from breathing the cold air when we both stopped at the terrible sight. The once-great tree lay on the ground, its massive trunk splintered a couple of feet above the ground. Most of the branches were crushed or broken off as they fell. Kasey and I looked at each other before getting closer. The cluster of ladybugs was nowhere to be found. The limbs I swung from just yesterday lie shattered beneath the weight of the wrecked tree. Worse still, inside the jagged stump, I could see the wood in the center was dead. Frowning, I grabbed a handful of waterlogged, decomposing wood. Only the outer few inches of the tree beneath the bark was actually alive. I realized it was probably on the verge of collapse since I first saw it.

“You see,” Kasey said, as I wiped the rotten wood from my hands. “It’s the witch.”

Kasey jumped up on the collapsed tree trunk and walked its length like a balance beam. “She’s still haunting those woods. All these years later, she’s still making bad things happen.”

I felt a chill, but couldn’t tell if it came from Kasey’s story or the strong breeze which seemed to come from nowhere.

“A witch couldn’t have done this,” I said. “She’d be a hundred years old by now.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Kasey jumped from the trunk. “Witches live hundreds of years on the blood of children just like us.”

I desperately wanted this to be false. I tried to think of a way to prove Kasey was lying.

“The witch couldn’t live all year in the woods. What about winter? She would have frozen to death.”

“That’s why she killed the farmer who used to plant this field. Why don’t you think anyone lives in the house at the crossroads?” Kasey gestured to the derelict house at the opposite end of the field. A window from the house’s turret peeked ominously through empty tree branches and rising fog.

“My dad said nobody lives there because it isn’t safe. He said the roof is caving in.”

“Has he ever been there before?” Kasey wore a terrible smirk on her face.

“I don’t…”

“Of course, he hasn’t! Because he knew the witch was living inside.” The wind was picking up again and I felt cold standing next to the old oak tree.

“I’ll bet none of the grown-ups have gone to that house. They’re probably all scared, just like you.”

“Am not!” I felt my brow furrowing.

“Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat!”

“I am not.”

“Then come with me.”

“Where?”

“To the witch’s house stupid.” Before I could say anything, Kasey took off through the fog. Her bright jacket almost completely vanished before I tried catching up with her. I didn’t want to go to the house, but I definitely didn’t want to stay by myself in the fog. At this point, I had no idea where Kasey was. I just knew the direction she went. The occasional crow erupted from a hiding place around the clumps of grass as I struggled to keep up. Their loud caws were the only sound I could hear besides the squishing of wet grass and my strained breathing as I ran. The fog seemed to thicken at the far end of the field. In some places, I couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead of me.

I finally reached the tree line before the house’s yard when I saw Kasey’s magenta jacket. She was moving slowly toward the back porch of the house. I ran the short distance to catch up with her. She must have heard my footsteps because she turned to face me with a finger to her lips. She gestured for me to come closer.

“Somebody is inside,” She whispered.

“Stop telling lies.” I shuddered at the thought. I felt exposed in the relatively empty, albeit overgrown yard.

“I’m telling the truth.” Kasey’s eyes were wide. “I saw a shadow move behind the upstairs window.”

I looked at the dilapidated house and realized it was in even worse shape than I thought. Wooden siding hung loosely from the sides of the house. Several of the windows were shattered. Vines from some wild plant grew through the collapsed portion of the roof. The porch was riddled with termite holes. The door on the back porch stood halfway open, giving us a view of the hallway. Wallpaper hung, peeling from chalky plaster. The wooden floor was covered with moss, scraps of paper, and broken ceiling tiles. The staircase had several broken steps. We stopped in our tracks at bottom of the porch steps.

“Come on aren’t you going to come inside?” Kasey looked much less sure of herself.

“Nobody could live in this place. Not even a witch.”

“So, you say.”

Kasey took the first step onto the porch. I followed close behind, keeping a watchful eye to the trees around the house. I felt like we weren’t alone as we advanced on the back door. I tried thinking of some way to get Kasey to leave this place as the porch creaked under our combined weight. We avoided the broken boards until we were at the threshold of the ruined house. With an uncertain foot, Kasey stepped into the house. Stray pieces of glass crunched underfoot as I followed on the filthy carpet. I looked through a doorframe to my right and could see light streaming in from the holes in the roof. The vines I saw outside disappeared into a large sink filled with decaying leaves and blackened water. Debris under my feet made more noise as I walked into the tiled floor of what I now recognized as a kitchen. The plaster from the walls left coarse white dust over most of the counters and floors. I was about to turn and find Kasey when I stopped in my tracks. There was a muddy footprint on the floor. I looked down at the wet mud around its edges and felt suddenly sick. It was at least twice the size of my own foot. I followed the muddy outlines and realized they went up the stairs.

My eyes followed the stairs up to the landing and fixed themselves on a weathered door on the top step. A door creaking echoed through the house. It came from upstairs. Kasey ran past me in the hallway and out the back door. I heard noises like a cat hissing loudly as I bolted from the kitchen after Kasey. I felt my world spin as I slipped on some of the trash and hit the wooden hallway floor with a loud thump. I gasped and clutched my chest as I felt the wind knocked out of my lungs. Large clumps of plaster ground loudly against the wood and forgotten leaves of paper crumbled as I scrambled out the front door. A door somewhere in the house slammed as I jumped from the porch. Kasey was standing at the fencerow waving for me to run. Her eyes looked back in horror. I turned to see a shadowy figure behind the curtain at the top of the turret move.

We avoided the field the rest of the day. We didn’t even leave the house, we just stayed on the couch and away from the windows until bedtime. That night, Kasey left her blanket hanging over the edge of the top bunk to cover the window looking into our room, and got into the bottom bunk with me.

“I’ll bet the witch saw us,” Kasey said.

“Maybe she didn’t.” I knew how foolhardy the suggestion was before I said it.

“Didn’t you see her moving behind the upstairs curtain? She had to have seen us.”

“Then why didn’t she come after us? Surely she wouldn’t let us get away.”

Kasey thought for a minute. I could hear the flap, slap, flapping of the worn-out screen door in the carport. I reassured myself. I checked the back door before I came to bed. The chain was in place. Nobody could open the door from the outside, not even with a key.

“Maybe the witch only comes out at night. Like a vampire.”

“Maybe.” I lay there holding Teddy tight. That morning I hadn’t believed anything about witches. Now I was having a serious conversation about the possibility one could be just across the barren field next to my grandparents’ house.

“What are we going to do?”

“I don’t know.”

The wind billowed past the window near the bunk bed. I cringed as a low branch scraped against the glass. “I’ll ignore it,” I thought to myself. I wasn’t about to let a little wind bother me, not when I had a real problem.

That’s when I heard the doorknob to the back door rattle. I could hear the loud thumps as something slammed into the back door. We screamed in our beds as the chain rattled with each attempt to shove the door open. Maggie, the black lab barked and started growling at the back door.

“Someone is trying to get in!” Tears ran down Kasey’s face. I could hear the mattress in my grandparents’ room groan as they got out of bed. With speed I wasn’t used to seeing, Grandpa rushed past the open door to the guest room with his shotgun. The glow of the floodlights in the carport shined through the blanket covering our window. Granny ran into our room and tried her best to comfort us.

“Shhhh. It’s alright,” She said, hugging us. “It’s just coyotes.” In all the commotion, the blanket fell from the window. Now the once familiar yard and fence row looked menacing in the blueish light.

“Granny it’s not coyotes. The witch is trying to get in!” Kasey cried again.

“That old wives’ tale? Sweetie, there’s nothing out there but those wild dogs. Grandpa is locking the door, don’t you worry.”

“By lock, she means shoving the wooden wedge under the bottom to keep it closed,” I thought as I looked outside. I stared into the darkened tree line and field beyond. It was impossible to tell if anything was out there, but my eyes kept playing tricks on me. Shoots of grass looked like a crouching witch. Empty tree branches looked like emaciated hands. Every rustling leaf and swaying tree left me more uncertain about whether something lurked just beyond the reach of the floodlights outside.

We gathered enough courage to venture outside the next day. The blue spruce swayed in the breeze. I could still see the yellow splinters where I broke a branch off trying to get my cousin’s kite last summer. I remembered her telling me to go out on the limb alone because it was too small for us both.

“We need to come up with a plan for what to do about the witch,” Kasey said as she climbed on top of the platform of the old well.

“Grandpa said not to play up there! The platform isn’t safe to stand on!”

Kasey grabbed the long pump handle on the well and rocked on the balls of her feet. It creaked as she pumped rusty water from the spout.

“But… Granny said it was just coyotes.”

“She just wanted to keep us from getting scared. Would you want two little kids to know a witch was trying to get into the house?”

I shook my head. “No.”

“Exactly. She probably had no idea how to get rid of a witch in the first place.”

I looked up at Kasey. “Do you?”

“Um,” Kasey looked down as she jumped from the platform. “Salt! That’s it. Witches can’t cross a trail of salt.”

“How do you know that?”

“My cousin Jeremy told me so. He’s the one who let me borrow the book about witches.”

“I thought you said Kathy Co…”

Kasey looked angry. “Shut up. I told you I read it didn’t I?”

“Yes.” I looked down at my feet. “But how are we going to put salt all the way around the house? We’d need a huge bag!”

“Not if we just do the doors and windows. Here’s what we’ll do: We can wait till Grandpa and Granny are asleep. Then, we’ll get into the cupboard and get their can of salt. Then We can spread the salt. It’s that easy!”

“But what if the witch gets us while we’re outside?”

“She won’t get us. Not if we finish before the witching hour.”

“The what?”

“Midnight? That’s when witches come out.”

Suddenly grandpa appeared on the porch. “Kids… Lunch is ready.”

Kasey and I trudged through the yard and back to the house. Climbing the steps to the house, I noticed something odd: the radio was off. Grandpa might have turned down the volume during the day while he watched the weather forecast and local news, but he almost always kept it on till Granny got home. The TV was also off as we walked through the living room. If felt wrong for there not to be some ambient noise in the house. I pulled up a chair at the kitchen table and started crushing crackers into my chicken noodle soup. Grandpa was quiet as he sat down to eat. His usual, laid-back demeanor was replaced with alert eyes and silence. He was wearing the olive drab jacket from his army days and I could see brass and waxed paper cylinders in his pocket. I realized they were shotgun shells. Kasey and I looked at each other as we ate our soup. I wondered if she noticed this when the police scanner screeched to life in the living room. Grandpa got up and turned the volume down after the dispatcher said something about a suspect being “at large”. I wondered what that meant.

“Why aren’t you listening to music grandpa?”

He made a small smile. “I have a bit of a headache. It’ll go away with a little quiet.”

We finished eating and Grandpa asked us to stay inside while he made a phone call. I thought it was unusual for him to take the call outside, but he said we could watch TV while he was talking. He spoke in hushed tones as he paced the porch, occasionally looking over his shoulder. I wondered what had him acting this way as I turned on the TV. Grandpa left it on the news and there was a hand-drawn picture of a man with long, scraggly hair and strange-looking eyes. I didn’t give it much thought before changing to a cartoon channel. Scooby-Doo was on and I always loved watching them solve mysteries. I hoped another episode would be on next because Fred was pulling a mask off a supposed “wolf-man”. It was always just a man in a mask. There were no real monsters, no matter how real they seemed.

Kasey plopped down on the couch. “Just checked. There’s plenty of salt in the cupboard.”

“Why can’t we put the salt out now? In the daytime?”

“Do you remember how mad Granny was when you used all her spices on ‘Experiments’ that one time? Besides, Granny might see the salt and try to clean it up.” I felt embarrassed thinking back to the time I dumped the whole spice cupboard into a mixing bowl. I thought I was doing a chemistry experiment, but in reality, I was just making a mess of nutmeg, cinnamon, and garlic powder.

“Are you sure it’s safe?”

“Of course. I read that book. I even did a show-and-tell about it.” We were interrupted by the rattling of the screen door.

“Well, Johnny,” Grandpa said. “Your parents are coming back a day early. The retreat ended, so they’ll be here late tonight or early in the morning to pick you up. They’re on the way to the airport right now.” He ruffled my hair as he walked through the living room, lighting another cigarette.

“Your Granny is coming home early from work today too. Maybe we’ll have some more cheeseburgers for supper.”

Grandpa smiled as he said these things, but I could tell something was off. Kasey and I kept watching TV until Granny got home. Even with her back, the house was quiet. She didn’t get onto Grandpa for not doing the dishes or cleaning up around the house. My grandparents stayed barely even spoke, except for a few whispered words. My parents called while I was in the bath to let my grandparents know they were on the way, but it would be a few hours before they showed up.

“We’re going to head to bed,” Granny said as she rubbed her eyes. “Johnny, your parents are going to be here late tonight.” She glanced at the clock. “You and Kasey can watch cartoons until they get here, just promise me you’ll wake me up when they get here. OK?”

“OK, Granny,” I said giving her hugs before Kasey and I settled back onto the couch.

“One more thing,” Granny said from behind her bedroom door. “Keep the doors locked.”

I thought this a weird request, but Ky and I both agreed. Granny went to bed. I looked at the clock near the TV. It was almost 11 o’clock. I wondered if I could get out of Kasey’s crazy idea. It didn’t take long before I could hear my grandparents snoring in their room. I pretended to be interested in the movie on TV. It was a kids’ movie about witches trying to capture a small girl about my age. She had a big brother who was trying to keep her safe. “I wished my cousin was more like him,” I thought as I watched Kasey disappear into the kitchen. I thought she was making popcorn until I hear the faint sound of a chair dragging across the floor to the cupboards. I thought about what she was doing when the movie suddenly had my full attention. One of the kids in this movie shook salt all around her just as the witches were closing in on her. Kasey hadn’t read about salt keeping witches away. She must have watched this movie and assumed I had never seen it. I felt betrayed. The same feeling I had as the branch of the spruce tree cracked under my weight while I tried to get Kasey’s kite. This was just another one of Kasey’s tricks.

She returned to the living room with a can picturing a girl holding an umbrella.

“Here, you take this.” She held out the salt shaker from the table. “Now, it’s simple. We go out the front door I’ll go around the left side, you go around the right side, then…”

“No,” I said. Kasey looked taken aback. I think it was one of the few times I ever confronted her.

“What?”

“I’m not going to that side of the house. It’s closest to the empty field where the witch’s house is.”

“Yes, you will.”

“If you try to make me go to the right side of the house, I’ll wake up Granny and tell her what you’re up to.” Kasey’s lip quivered with frustration.

“F-Fine,” she said. “You take the left side since you’re such a fraidy-cat. You cover the windows on your side of the house, and I’ll cover mine.” She threw the salt shaker at me and waited next to the door. I looked at the clock before I joined her. We still had almost an hour I thought, although I was considerably less confident in this solution. I realized Kasey was just trying to use me again. As I put my sneakers on, I had an idea. Why not simply act like I was putting salt around the windows until she was out of sight, and then sneak back inside. The door to the carport had that large gap under it. I could spread salt under it from inside the house.

The front door of the house opened silently and Kasey gingerly closed the screen door after us. “Meet back here,” she said. I nodded as I climbed down the left side of the porch and salted around the window on the front of the house. The cold night air made my breath fog up as I kept an eye on Kasey. She already finished her window and disappeared around the corner of the house. Once I was sure she wasn’t coming back, I tip-toed up the porch and carefully slipped inside the screen door. I kicked off my shoes and walked to the back door to spread the salt onto the threshold. I felt somewhat proud for standing up to Kasey. I tried to think of another time I had done this but couldn’t.

The shaker was almost empty as I took the top off. I knelt to the ground to pour the last of my salt along the threshold. The white salt shone in the light of the clear night. I admired the job I had done, even if I thought it wasn’t effective, and I knew Granny wouldn’t be happy when she found it in the morning. I was about to stand up when I froze. Beneath the door were two muddy boots. I was so shocked I didn’t say anything until the door creaked open slightly and I saw the sharp blade of a knife hook into the links of the chain holding the door closed. I yelled for my grandpa as I realized what was happening.

I scrambled away from the door and under the kitchen table as I heard grandpa jump out of bed. Through the crack of the door, I could make out vague features of the man outside as he shook the door violently, trying to get in. With the long hair, the thin face, the wild, deranged eyes I realized it was the man on the news station. Grandpa ran into the kitchen with nothing but his boxers and the shotgun.

“Get the hell out!” He pumped the shotgun and the arm with the knife disappeared through the battered door. Grandpa knelt down. “What happened? Are you hurt? Where’s Kasey?”

We heard Kasey’s high-pitched scream. From the kitchen floor, I could see through the window in the guest bedroom. The crazed man had run into Kasey trying to get away and grabbed her. Grandpa ran out the back door with the shotgun after them, but he couldn’t move fast enough, not with his bad back. The last I saw of my cousin was her pale face screaming in horror and outstretched hand reaching for grandpa as she disappeared into the overgrown field of Indiangrass beyond the reach of the floodlights.",1,1748542383.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Today marks one year since I left Jersey City for good and returned to my home country. And yet, my heart still lingers there.

My adventure with the city began in 2019 when I arrived as a master’s student for the fall semester at Stevens Institute of Technology.

I started my journey in Journal Square, and it felt surreal as this was my first time away from India but jokingly still felt like India. But to my surprise, I found stores like D-Mart, something I never imagined seeing abroad. That little discovery gave me comfort.

The early days were filled with confusion. Google Maps was my lifeline guiding me to the laundromat, C-Town, Indian grocery stores, and even Aqui Market (which I was sad to see shut down post-COVID).

With time, the city grew familiar. Sunsets at Exchange Place became a ritual; I loved watching the colors dance off the glass facade of Brookfield Place. Semicolon Coffee at Exchange Place served the best tiramisu latte I’ve ever had. I only discovered it right before I left, and I still regret not finding it sooner.

Newark Ave felt like a cultural mosaic. I still remember the biryani at Golconda (usually fresh on Thursday nights) and the South Indian breakfast buffet at Sapthagiri on weekend mornings.

Pizza, of course, was a staple. 3 Guys from Italy was my go-to, along with slices from Artichoke Basille. Special shoutout to Razza for their phenomenal Neapolitan pies.

From 2020, The Heights became home. For nearly four years, I lived across from Washington Park, what a blessing! Summer evenings were spent watching dogs play at the park or strolling down to the Hoboken riverfront. The neighborhood was peaceful and safe; I often took late-night walks to Union City just to grab a scoop from Baskin Robbins.

Grove Street on weekends had its own energy. The Ashford gave me my first nightclub experience—a memory I’ll always hold dear.

But beyond places and food, Jersey City taught me life lessons such as resilience, mental strength, kindness, and finding your place even when everything feels unfamiliar.

Even though I’ve left, something still feels incomplete. Jersey City carved a permanent space in my heart. I don’t know if I’ll ever return to live the life I once dreamed of there, but I’ll always be grateful.

Thank you, Jersey City..for moulding me into the person I am today. ❤️

Hi everyone, 

I wanted to give an update after speaking with a lawyer about my situation. According to the law where I live, I’m not eligible to file for divorce until after two years of marriage, and even then, we must be separated for at least one year before filing. The only legal ground for divorce here is an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. 

I’ve continued living in the same space with him, and while things are no longer explosive, they’re far from resolved. He’s still in contact with her, I don’t know to what extent, and I’ve accepted that I can’t control his choices. I can only control mine.

Lately, he’s been asking if I’m seeing anyone or if I’ve slept with someone new. I haven’t. But I’ve been spending more time with myself.. going on solo dates, reflecting, reconnecting with who I am outside of marriage. And I’m not closed off to connection anymore. If someone I’m genuinely interested in approaches me, I won’t say no to a date or a cup of coffee. I’m no longer sitting in emotional purgatory while he keeps a door open to someone else.

That said, I haven’t brought up the idea of an open marriage yet, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about, not as a way to fix anything, but as a possible way to navigate this legally bound phase with more autonomy and self-respect.

I’ve built a whole life here and I would hate to uproot it all, I don’t want to start over in a new country for the second time. That said, if it comes to that, I’ll do what I have to do. I think I’ve reached a place of acceptance: this is happening, it’s out of my control, and I’m doing my best to move forward with grace. I’ve placed the rest in God’s hands. 

My dad has continued to show up for me and gave me his word that he’ll be there for me through this period. That support means everything.

I’m still moving forward, still centering myself, and still choosing to honor my needs, even when things feel murky. Thank you again to everyone who supported me on my previous post. Your kindness helped me more than you know.",1,1748542320.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

You need the type of content that others may want to link to.. AKA Linkable assets..

Think of linkable assets as your website’s magnet for attention.

These are pieces of content that naturally attract backlinks because they genuinely help people in your industry or community.

And the best part? You can make linkable assets for every business or service possible.

1kyhsgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiandatingadvice/comments/1kyhsgn/i_need_advice/,I need advice..,"Hey everyone, I could really use some wisdom, encouragement, and prayer right now.

I’ve been getting close to someone recently, and I’ve realized I’m starting to fall for him. The hard part is, even though I feel emotionally ready for a relationship, I know deep down I’m not truly in a healthy place to be in one. He’s not ready either..he’s admitted that, and on top of that, he’s not a believer.

I felt the Holy Spirit nudging me not to engage, but I ignored that check in my spirit because I thought maybe we could just be friends. I had a dream the other day that clearly pointed to staying just friends when I was questioning what “we” even were, because it felt like more than friends at this point.. But if I’m honest, I let my emotions and desires take over.

I ended up crossing some boundaries I had set for myself and got caught up in conversations I shouldn’t have entertained things that were sexual in nature. And now I feel hurt, disappointed, and convicted. Especially because he’s not pursuing commitment or even putting in small effort, like he wouldn’t even offer to buy me a coffee.. (not that it matters but just an example and the point) 

I know I’ve let my guard down. I feel broken and ashamed. I’ve struggled with this pattern before, and I keep falling back into it. My flesh wins more than I want to admit, and I’m tired of failing in this area.

Please pray for me. for healing, clarity, and strength to walk in obedience. And if any of you have walked through something similar or have wisdom to share, I would deeply appreciate your insight. How do I go about expressing this to him and what do I do going forward? Would just being friends be possible with time even though we have more feelings for each other than that? Its such a rough situation I caused for myself. I just want to honor God with my heart and my relationships, and right now I feel like I’ve veered off that path.

1kyhl6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kyhl6h/update_my_child_went_missing_and_came_back/,Update: My child went missing and came back different.,"Hi again. I posted here before, asking for advice. If you didn’t catch the first one, here’s the short version: my kid went missing for two weeks. When he came back, he was different. Not just little things, but big gaps in his memory, stuff that didn’t add up.

The comments were all over the place. Some agreed with the psychologist—said it was trauma. Others started guessing what might’ve happened to him. Honestly, some of it was hard to read. And a few accused me of seeing things, making it up from stress. Just so we’re clear—I don’t have any mental illness history. That’s not it.

But what meant the most was the people who believed me. Some said maybe what came back wasn’t my son. That hit hard. But weirdly, it also felt real—like maybe they get it. People mentioned changelings, doppelgängers, fae stuff. Sounds crazy until you live it.

One comment stuck with me. Someone said something like,  
“OP, you’re not crazy. My daughter went through the same. Can we meet and talk?”

I messaged him. Turns out he’s about an hour away. We planned to meet while my son stayed with his dad. Yes, I know meeting strangers isn’t smart. But I thought my son’s life might be at risk. I took precautions—public place, pepper spray in my coat.

Let’s call him Fred. He looked older than me, late 40s maybe. Scruffy beard, dark bags under his eyes. If his story’s true, I get why. He was sitting alone, nursing black coffee.

I asked, “Are you \[his username\]?”  
He said, “Are you OP?”

We sat down. Small talk was awkward. Neither of us wanted to waste time. I told him more than I ever did online—things I couldn’t put in a post. He nodded like he’d heard it all before.

Then he pulled out two photos—same little girl. One smiling, one with a blank stare.  
“That was my daughter,” he said, showing the first. “This is what came back.”

At first, they looked like the same kid. Same face shape, same nose, same eyes. But when he pointed out the differences, I started seeing them. His daughter had auburn hair, the kind that looks ginger in certain lighting. In the second photo, the girl’s hair had more brown in it. The freckles were gone. Her face was thinner, more defined. The dimples were deeper. The eyes had the same shape, but not the same color. His daughter had bluish green eyes. The other girl’s were greenish blue. They could have been sisters, maybe even twins, but they weren’t the same girl.

“She went missing in August last year,” Fred said. “And came back in early September. Or at least, something came back. Me and the wife didn’t care at first. She didn’t remember anything. Not our names, not the house, not even her own bedroom. But we were just so happy to have her back.”

He said the first strange thing was when they woke up one night and found her standing over their bed. They started letting her sleep between them. When she had trouble at school, they hired a tutor. When she began drawing weird patterns, they got her a psychologist.

“What was she drawing?” I asked.

“Animals,” he said. “Except they weren’t animals. Not from this world. You ever see a kid draw a dog, but it ends up looking more like a stick bug with a collar? Like that. But these weren’t dogs, or stick bugs. They weren’t anything we could name.”

She started having problems at school. She wasn’t getting along with other kids. They pulled her out and kept her at home. That was when she started staying up all night. “Going nocturnal” he called it. They had to lock the doors and windows or she’d wander outside. She started hurting herself. Not with cuts, but by hitting the floor and walls with her hands until the skin split. His wife quit her job to stay home full-time. They tried everything they could because they loved her so much.

They kept telling themselves she was just hurting and didn’t know how to talk about it. They found another psychologist, because clearly the first one wasn’t helping. But things got worse. She started getting physical with them and other adults. They had to give away their dog because they were scared of what she’d do to it. Then she realized sharp objects hurt more than floors, and her self-harming escalated.

That was when they knew they couldn’t keep going like this. They started looking for a facility that could help, somewhere with 24/7 care. He said it was the hardest decision they ever had to make. They felt like they were giving up, but they were terrified if things kept going the way they were she’d eventually kill herself.

“We were careful with our search,” he said. Most places wouldn’t take kids that young, so they also started looking for jobs and a house nearby, so they could move to be closer. It was a time-consuming process, but they were convinced it would all be worth it in the end.

Fred paused, and then he said something I needed to hear.

“I thought a few times... this couldn’t be my daughter. But I didn’t let myself think like that. I didn’t know how that could even be possible. I just wanted to help her.”

Then he told me about the second time she went away, and this time, it was for good.

“She broke a window,” he said. “I thought it was a mirror at first, but it was the living room window. I ran after her. Into the woods. I wasn’t going to lose her again.”

I asked him if he found her.

“I found her,” he said. “She was standing in a clearing. I called her name. She turned around. That was when I knew. Those weren’t my daughter’s eyes. Then the wind picked up, and a light appeared from above.”

“A light?” I asked.

He nodded. “Bright. Like a spotlight. I thought it might be a helicopter, but it wasn’t making any sound. It was focused right on her. Then she started floating.”

I didn’t say anything. I just sat there.

“It was a UFO,” he said. “It took her. Took the decoy back.”

Maybe there was a time when I would have called him crazy. But not anymore. Not after what I’ve seen.

“I think they take our kids,” Fred said. “For research. And they send down something that looks like them. So no one notices. But when we started figuring it out, they had to take it back. Those things she was drawing... she had seen them. On whatever planet they came from.”

I didn’t say anything for a long time after Fred finished talking. The air between us felt heavy. I just sat there, gripping the edges of my chair like I might float off too if I let go. He didn’t push me to respond. Just stared down into his coffee, like he’d said it all before and didn’t expect anyone to believe him anymore.

But I did. God help me, I did.

“They’re still up there,” he said at last.

His voice was low. Almost reverent.

I blinked. “Up where?”

He glanced toward the window, like he expected to see something out there in the clouds.

“Our kids,” he said. “The real ones. They still have them.”

I froze. Cold, electric under my skin.

“They still have them?” I repeated.

Fred nodded slow. “They didn’t just take them to look. They’re studying them. Studying us through them. They didn’t destroy anything. Just pulled their spirits away and left us with copies.”

I leaned in, ready to fight. “How do we get them back?”

He looked me in the eyes like he’d been waiting for that question.  
“You steal your son’s spirit back.”

I waited for more.

“If you find your son’s soul and put it back in the copy,” he said, “the copy stops being a copy. It becomes him.”

I didn’t blink. I knew I had to listen. It was the only way.

“How?” I asked. “How do I find him?”

He smiled, but not a good smile. One that said, *you’re finally ready.*

“You have to leave your body,” he said. “Astral separation. There’s a realm outside this one. Full of things they don’t want us to see. I can help you get there.”

I felt lightheaded. “How?”

He tapped his coat pocket. “I’ve got the real stuff. The good stuff. Things that open your third eye. Let you see behind the curtain.”

“Like… meditation? Ritual?” I asked.

He snorted. “Psychedelics. LSD. Things that were legal until they scared them. The government cracked down, but some of us still know how to get it.”

My hands gripped the chair arms.

“You want me to take drugs?” I said flat.

“Not drugs,” he said. “Keys. Tools. The only way in.”

But I was already standing. Something flipped in me. The weight of all I’d heard pressed down hard.

“I should go,” I said, halfway to the door.

He shouted after me, “Don’t you want your son back?” Loud enough for people to look.

I didn’t turn.

Got in my car, slammed the door, sat gripping the wheel like it’d hold me together. Hands shaking. I had to remember to breathe.

I was this close to taking drugs from a stranger on Reddit. A guy talking aliens and soul-swapping.

But here I am. Back where I started. Asking for help again.

Because something’s still wrong.

I don’t know what to believe. I don’t think Fred lied.

Something is happening. Something I can’t explain.

And the worst part?

I’m starting to think I’d do anything—anything—to get my real son back.

Hello!

I’m looking for some outside perspectives on my current living situation and whether I’m justified in feeling a bit frustrated.

I’ve been living in my flat for five years now. I moved in during the COVID period, so the rent was particularly low at the time. Since then, the rent has increased several times—once immediately after the rent cap was lifted, and again at the beginning of 2024. Most recently, it went up by 12% at the beginning of this year, conveniently right after the latest cap expired. The increase was said to reflect the “current market value” in the area, which is particularly frustrating because the letting agency owns most of the properties around here—so they effectively are the market.

To be fair, they’ve generally been responsive when it comes to repairs and maintenance. That said, we’ve had a recurring mouse problem which they haven’t really solved—they sent a pest control guy a few times to lay traps, but ultimately told us it was just “unavoidable.”

We didn’t object to the latest rent hike at the time. But about a month after the period to challenge it had ended, we were informed that there would be major building works taking place from early April through to mid-September.

It’s been incredibly disruptive. There’s scaffolding completely covering all of our windows, and every weekday there are workers just a few feet away, looking directly into the flat as the windows are quite large and rooms small. It’s made the space feel exposed and uncomfortable, especially when working from home.

On top of that, the building is quite old and the windows are already drafty (and successible to black mould) Now, with the construction, dust is constantly blowing through the gaps and settling on everything—including my bed.

The scaffolding has also taken over the small communal terrace at the back of the building. It wasn’t a huge space to begin with, but it used to be somewhere to get fresh air or have a coffee. Now it’s completely unusable during the week, with workers out there during the day and scaffolding taking up a large amount of space.

I didn’t mind too much at first, but now that it’s affecting our privacy, comfort, air quality, and access to spaces, I’m starting to feel really fed up.

Am I right to be bothered by all of this? Obviously the work needs to be done and it’s not the builders fault at all, but it does feel like the whole situation is a bit cheeky on my landlords side. Would it be unreasonable to ask for some kind of rent reduction or compensation given the level of disruption and the timing of it all?

Any advice or similar experiences would be really appreciated—thanks for reading!",0,1748541669.0,TenantsInTheUK,0,0.5,False

1kyhi9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kyhi9v/the_last_customer/,The Last Customer,"I work the graveyard shift at a 24-hour diner off Highway 9. It’s mostly truckers, insomniacs, and the occasional drunk who stumbles in after the bars close. You get used to a certain rhythm like black coffee, burnt bacon, and the hum of flickering neon.

Then *he* came in.

It was 3:17 AM. I remember because I had just refilled the sugar dispensers and was counting tips. The bell above the door didn’t ring. He was just suddenly… *there*, sitting in booth six.

Old man. Thin. Pale. Wearing a black coat, even though it was warm for October. He stared at the menu like it meant something.

“Coffee?” I asked, grabbing the pot.

He nodded. “Cream only.”

As I poured, I noticed something off. The steam didn’t rise. The coffee stayed still, like it wasn’t hot. I checked the pot. Still warm. I didn’t say anything.

“What’ll it be?”

He looked up, and his eyes were the first real red flag. Not red like bloodshot. Red like… brake lights. Dim, but glowing.

“Do you still serve the soul pie?”

“The what?”

He smiled, slow and deliberate. “Used to be on the menu. Long ago.”

I laughed nervously. “You mean shoofly pie?”

He didn’t blink. “No. Soul pie. Crust of memory. Filling of regret. Served warm.”

I stepped back. “We don’t… have that. Haven’t heard of that.”

He leaned in. “Are you sure?”

I glanced at the old menu board above the register. Bacon & Eggs – $4.99. BLT – $3.99. But something new had appeared, written in chalk I didn’t remember using.

**Soul Pie – Market Price**

My throat went dry. I turned back to him. He hadn’t moved.

“Who are you?”

“I’m your last customer,” he said. “Every server gets one.”

My legs felt weak. I gripped the counter. “What do you mean?”

He gestured to the seat across from him. “Sit. You’ll understand.”

Something made me obey. I sat. He folded his hands neatly.

“You’ve worked here six years. You dropped out of college after your brother’s accident. You tell yourself you're just in between things, but you’ve been in-between for so long it *became* the thing.”

“How do you know that?”

“I know everything you regret,” he said gently. “And regret… is the main ingredient.”

The booth light flickered. Outside, the world seemed to stop. No cars. No wind. Even the clock above the grill had frozen.

He placed his hand palm-up on the table.

“Say yes,” he whispered.

I looked down. There was a pie in front of me now. Golden brown. Smelled like childhood and sorrow. It shimmered.

“What happens if I eat it?”

“You relive your choices. But this time, you see them all at once. Every path not taken. Every door you closed. Every time you told yourself *tomorrow.*”

My hands trembled. “And then?”

“You get to pick one. Just one.”

“And this life?”

“Gone.”

I stared at the pie. I thought about my brother. About the things I’d said. The funeral I skipped. The way my parents had stopped calling. About the years I spent serving people who never looked me in the eye.

“What if I don’t eat it?”

He tilted his head. “Then you go on. As is. No changes. No answers. You wake up tomorrow, fry more eggs. But deep down… you’ll always wonder.”

I looked at him. “Are you the Devil?”

He chuckled. “No. The Devil sells what you *want*. I offer what you *could’ve had.* There’s a difference.”

I picked up the fork. It was ice cold.

“Just one bite,” he said.

I hesitated. My reflection stared back from the silver. I remembered being eight, riding bikes with my brother down a hill too fast. I remembered yelling at him when he broke his leg. I remembered not saying goodbye.

I took a bite.

It was sweet. And bitter. And *heavy.*

The world around me burst like a film reel on fire.

I was seventeen, saying yes to music school.  
I was twenty, hugging my brother before the crash.  
I was twenty-five, in a tiny apartment, painting, smiling, broke but alive.

I was *all of them.*

And then, I was back. The booth was empty.

No old man. No pie. Just the check.

**Soul Pie – Paid**

I stumbled outside. Morning had come. A soft pink dawn rising over the gas station.

Everything looked the same.

But I wasn’t.

I called my mom. First time in three years.

I've been listening for years and haven't had anything I felt was incredibly great to share... 

But now... I had a week from hell and I HAVE to get this off my chest. Some background context is necessary for you to understand how diabolical this situation is at the moment. Keep in mind, I have an extreme intolerance/allergy to nightshade foods and an auto-immune condition that has worsened over the years, so my food options are pretty limited. To help you understand, a small list of things I cannot have include tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, onion bulbs, paprika, peppers (excluding black and white)... the list goes on, but these are in just about everything pre-made at the store. 

I (38f) and my husband (39m) have been married for twelve years and I have a son (18m) from a prior marriage. We had a whirlwind romance that started with the pick up line, ""Do you want to get married and have kids?"" To which I responded, ""That is my end goal, but we should probably date first."" We've known each other since high school, and wouldn't you know it, we were married and expecting a baby within three months of that pick up line. We had a quick wedding and traveled to where his parents lived for the event, making them our witnesses and meeting them for the first time all in a jam packed weekend. The last night I was there (I had to fly back before my husband), my FIL asked, ""So, when are you all moving here?"" I responded, ""We aren't moving here. I have a son back home."" That should have ended it, right? WRONG! He then said, ""But that doesn't matter, right? You all can move here."" I have one of those faces that expresses my feelings before I can get a sound out of my mouth, so I know my look beat this next line to the punch. ""We, are, not, moving here."" Hubby addressed this afterward, but it left a nasty taste in my mouth that someone could so flagrantly dismiss another person's child like that. My husband was originally going to move there, but then I waltzed into his life at the last possible second before that trigger was pulled. I guess this really upset them, but they already had the older son (BIL, 41m) living in the area. Whatever.

Over the years, FIL continues to be slightly offensive (not going to lie, sometimes it is intentionally and blatantly offensive) and attempts to pick fights politically or religiously. We do not agree on any of that stuff, and while I am always up for a healthy debate of ideas - he most certainly is not. He NEEDS to be right, and most of the time to do that he says ""prove it! prove it! prove it!"" Imagine that meme of the woman yelling at the cat, and the cat is cool as a cucumber - that is my relationship with my FIL but I'm the cat because I frankly do not care for bullying tactics and I do not have to seek approval from him to enrich my life.

Now, let's talk about MIL to prepare the background on that. She is nice, she is kind, and she is really kooky. I am not certain what mental health check boxes she specifically checks, but my husband straight up told her this week that she needs to see a doctor immediately. She talks for the sake of talking, even if she is the only one talking and everyone else is chatting to someone completely different. She freaks out over little things and retreats to a room alone to have a cry fit or something (not really sure, but she flits off and doesn't come out for about an hour). She is so kind in thinking of others and not putting anyone out, that she in fact puts other people out. This will be relevant later.

My oldest son, their step-grandson, graduated last week. Everyone knew this in advance, and as soon as I knew the date I sent a calendar invitation to everyone in the family. That was in August 2024... it is May 2025. They originally said they would come, but then in April they told us that they won't be able to afford traveling now being retired and they'll have to miss it. I told my husband that is disrespectful to me and my son, and we know they have plenty of money because we see what his parents spend their money on. I told him they can stay here if that helps with funds, and after a few weeks they agreed. 

I spent two days deep cleaning the house, with help from my other two kids (11f and 8m), and curated a menu for dinner every day that I can do for everyone so they didn't have to spend as much money. We are still struggling a little, but the extra expense for food was doable so I did all of the shopping for the week as well. They like certain things that we do not, like salad, tomatoes, and real milk, and I knew they would end up going to the store to purchase those items themselves as they usually do. To add, the times we have vacationed together or the last time they stayed with us for an extended period of time, my in-laws purchase some truly odd things that we have to throw away - this is ALSO relevant for later.

**Day One:** They never sent an itinerary, so we had no idea when they were landing all day. It starts getting later, and I figure they will get stuck in PM traffic. I was right, and they landed close to 5 PM. I used that to calculate when I needed to begin cooking dinner round one. Just to make you salivate, it was shrimp tacos in creamy sauce with cilantro rice. It's a fave in our house, and I figure they would love it for Taco Tuesday. 

I went slow, and then slower, as I watched the clock tick later and later - like, so late that I was thinking there is no way the traffic could be that bad. All at the same time, my husband arrives, then my in-laws arrive carrying plastic sacks from a grocery store. They already went to the store? Why? I don't know, but whatever - they are here! I get back to cooking, get plates for the kids and myself while everyone else is talking, moving, bringing in luggage, and putting away groceries. I saw the usual items being put away, but there was a whole V8 Splash as well, and I tried not to shrill at the vat of tomato juice in my house. I offered dinner to my husband and his parents, I even said I have enough for them to have one each as I undercounted the shrimp, and FIL said, ""Oh, no thanks. We are going to go get food."" Ooooookay? So when my husband was done getting his plate, I put the shrimp and rice into a container for me to eat later since it was free of spices I cannot eat. FIL did ask after they returned from eating at Raising Canes if I meant for them to have tacos, to which I affirmed, and he said, ""Oh I didn't know. I will have some of the leftovers tomorrow!"" I said, ""Well, they are in the same container now so I can eat it for lunch."" 

Anyway, we did talk to the in-laws about their groceries, and I asked them to please not bring fresh tomatoes into the house, and do not cook with seasonings that have paprika or other peppers as when aerosolized it now affects my ENT areas. The V8 was brought up by them, and I simply asked that they thoroughly wash the glasses and immediately put into the dishwasher if they had to have it the whole week. No biggie, they agreed to everything not knowing how bad my intolerance/allergy has gotten, no harm\\no foul.

**Day Two:** Hubby had to work, everyone woke up fairly early, and I tackled a few things on my computer for work though it wasn't anything critical (we own a small business). I spent time with them, talked with them, tried to be a good and present host. I was raised with southern hospitality which means your guests get your time, your energy, and your attention. All day. 

This was a relatively lazy day as graduation was the following day, and we all knew it was going to be a little bit of chaos. FIL was decently behaved, light-hearted discussion about philosophy and religion, but not ""religiousness"" if that makes sense, and he was actually not hard-nosing himself and bullying his viewpoints. He did, however, make a pass to get the leftover shrimp tacos when I pulled them out for lunch, and I reminded him that already combined everything. He made his way to the pantry and pulled out the tortillas, and I stated AGAIN, everything is in a bowl for me to eat because they didn't eat it last night. ""Oh... \[insert confused look\]... ok I guess"" he says. I decide to ignore that and move on with cooking my food, and I'm confused here - was I in the wrong on that? He flat refused, ate at a fast food place instead, and then reinserted himself to take the leftovers because he is... entitled to them once he refused them? My husband reassured me later to ignore FIL's antics and not make myself crazy keeping them happy.

Between lunch and dinner, FIL would be on his phone or tablet or starting to drop negative statements about our state, religion, politics and all of that. I did a good bit of ignoring it. MIL was talking... and talking... so I was talking and listening. It was getting late, so I turned to make dinner the way I usually do - ear bud in my right ear while listening to a podcast. I'm in my groove, moving along with cooking, and my FIL was apparently talking to me for a while and I didn't notice. I apologized, paused my podcast, and talked to him while cooking. Then he stopped talking... so I went back to my podcast. It happens again, I apologize, pause my podcast, and talk to him while cooking. It was a lot... and my ADHD didn't like it very much but I obliged. 

For dinner, I made two dishes of stuffed shells, each with a different sauce. The filling was the same, ground lamb cooked low and slow, mixed with spinach, fresh parsley/basil/oregano (from my herb garden), and cream cheese. I home make my cheese sauce due to other auto-immune issues, so one was with this special sauce and the other was with tomato sauce. I'm not a monster, other people can eat tomatoes but the cooking process has to be specific or it affects my sinuses. The latter was fully covered before going into the oven, nice and tight, so as to not cross-contaminate too much via air. The dinner was amazing (which, I knew it would be) and my FIL really wants the recipe. I agreed at the time, and since we aren't there yet, I am going to be petty and ignore that request for the rest of my life. Don't worry, you'll see why toward the end.

**Day Three:** Graduation Day. Nothing to see here. It was utter chaos, and with so much happening I didn't even cry when I watched my baby walk the stage!! We took pictures with my son, met up with my ex and his family briefly, and then we got out of dodge before a massive storm appeared. Dinner was at a sushi place as we thought it would be too late and too nuts for me to cook (aka, I basically said ""I'm not cooking that day"" and so, I did not).

It gets decided later on that everyone wants ice cream, so the in-laws take the kids to the store. They return, and I was thrilled when my husband said, ""look, honey! They got you your own little ice cream."" I don't have a hankering for ice cream often, and even when I do I don't tend to eat much. This frustrates me at times because my family can plow through a full gallon before I ever get the desire to eat some, so then I get nothing. My husband started doing this for me, get me a tiny one and the big one is for everyone else. It was a nice thought for my in-laws to do that for me!

**Day Four:** My husband got an early start with our work projects, I slowly got out of bed and used an extra round of coffee before I came in with an assist. I had to help him pick up and deliver product, remove debris, install, etc. I was in and out of the house several times throughout the day as I was pre-cooking some black beans and slow-cooking chicken for dinner. 

At one point, I hear that FIL and MIL want certain things from the store, and he asks me about green salsa. I said as long as it stays cold, totally cool with me. No problem, he had a few things to get and he added it to the list. I asked if he could pick up some chips so we could make nachos as left-overs, but nothing else came to mind from me. Not sure when he left, but I came home, left, and came home again in between projects and he was still gone. I then noticed that my white board was covered in their grocery list, which included chocolate syrup. I told MIL, ""We have chocolate syrup."" She responded, ""Well, he has to have Hershey's chocolate syrup and \[blah blah blah, I don't know what she said because I was filtering my responses before I spoke\]."" Remember when I said they like to just BUY things that are unnecessary, things I sometimes have to throw away or that simply take up real estate in my pantry/fridge? I took a deep breath and began with, ""I love you guys, but please do not buy things we already have and will not get through before it goes bad or it takes too much space. I have a system, and order, and I already know there are things you all eat that we don't and that's fine, but you all buy things sometimes that are a burden on my available space."" She started to text him, I said it's fine for now but please don't do it again - she had a freak out and disappeared but I also had to go back and help my husband again. I told my husband that I may have upset his parents but explained it, and his response was that it was mighty elitist of his dad to say he HAD TO have the name brand but our cheap brand isn't good enough. That was an excellent point, and I said, ""I didn't even think of it like that! Yea! We're broke but we aren't broke-broke!"" 

Anyway, we wrapped up the last job and I made dinner with my daughter. FIL was on his screens, earbuds in both ears, totally disconnected from the familial gathering happening in the living and dining spaces between all of us. All good, he's on vacation, right? After dinner, he made some politically charged remarks, completely unprompted, and I just ignored it. I was so tired from being outside and then cooking 24 enchiladas by hand that I was not going to let him harsh my buzz. MIL was talking about some nonsense, but no one was engaging with her and not sure what she was going on about.

Because I'm 99% sure you all are dying to know, what was for dinner? Dinner was cheese and shredded chicken enchiladas, flour tortillas because I'm a snob and it tastes better, with made-from-scratch sour cream sauce. The kids rate this as their number one fave in our repertoire of dinners.  

**Day Five:** This was grilled and smoked meats day - aka, ""I only do the sides"" day. My husband had his own special meat in mind and FIL had picked up some burgers and steaks the day before while shopping in order to chip in. There were some other things to address before we confirmed this was the thing we were doing, so it started a little late on the smoking. We had a stray cat issue the night before, so we brought out our airsoft guns and BB rifle to try and deter them from the yard - my cat is not my world, but also, don't mess with my cat! Turns out, both of my kids loved to shoot as we got a makeshift target area put together and let them practice. I needed to make a store run, which also happens to have more airsoft guns that may not be so hard for them to cock back, and my husband needed to go, so we go and FIL was left in charge of the smoker.

While we were out, we decided to purchase a new bottle of whiskey for FIL since he finished what we had and bought beer to take its place the night before. Real quick, nothing major, and it was MY idea. But, don't worry, I'm not bitter that my husband got all of the glory. We get a new airsoft gun that the kids can easily reload, pick up an actual target, all is right in the world. We come back, and while FIL took care of the smoker, no one was helping the kids with outdoor activities. Both in-laws were on their phones when we walked in the door. Okay, it's hot outside to them compared to what they are used to... fine. I had to immediately go outside as the kids wanted to shoot at the new target we bought but we couldn't use the new gun, so I was reload momma until I had to make the quick sides. Mind you, we were gone for about two hours, so instead of spending time with the grandkids they were on their phones.

Dinner is ready, and we set everything out in a buffet style fashion where you pluck what you want and keep moving. FIL got his plate first and sat at the table. I helped my kids get their plates ready as we had hot pots, but we made it through and then the adults filed in behind them (well, except FIL because I guess he was ""too special""). We all sit to eat, and FIL is full on into his phone again... at the dinner table. This is a no-no in our house, but he was a guest so we didn't say anything about. I thought he only had one ear bud in so I asked if he drinks pickle juice as he was fishing out some from a large jar, and until that point no one was really aware that he was completely checked out of the conversation. The rest of us giggled about it, and he finally caught on. My husband called him out for it and said it was rude to be disengaged that way while we are all communing as a family. The following is from memory, which is not great because the rise of vitriol was so real in my body after this. ""Well no one was even over at the table and talking."" ""Why is it rude when no one is even at the table when I started watching things on my phone?"" ""Okay, well then I will call YOU TWO out when you are on your phones and the kids are here.""

No. Sir.

I saw him on his phone a great deal. My husband and I run a small business on the side, so we have to use our phones for a minute to address some things. Also, if I need to look up something, I am using my phone. I never got on podcasts like I usually do (aka, our Potato Queen, Charlotte Dobre) and other various things I love to listen to IN AN EFFORT to give them all of my attention where possible. Nope! I clapped back, ""Excuse you. We have to run a business and my husband had to still work while they were here. I haven't played games, I haven't watched a podcast in front of them except once when I was cooking and deep in thought to get it done, so whatever you think about us being on our phones is crap. Furthermore, you have been on the phone a lot and not engaging with the kids which is the entire reason you came here in the first place. You will not point the finger at us, accept responsibility, and don't be rude in our home.""

I gave up, put earbuds in and started playing a video game. I had ZERO unwind time. ZERO downtime from the in-laws and the ensuing negativity they brought with them. I politely told my daughter, my son, and my husband when they walked in that I loved them, but my me time away from people was being taken away and I couldn't handle another ""Mom?"" or ""Honey?"" out of someone's mouth. Also, the amount of trash, dishes, and silverware that were added were more than double what our family of four does in a regular day (not week... DAY!!!).

**Day Six:** We all decided to go to a ren fair, they paid for them and the kids while we covered ourselves. Cool. We drive out, and I have the kids with me as I cannot with either of them at this point for a long period of time without my husband as a buffer. We get along fine, and as an olive branch I offered to buy my FIL a beer when I'm finally ready for one. He thanks me, and later he bought round two. Cool. FIL took off on his own to take pictures, which was fine. MIL stayed with us, also fine but she would ask questions or make statements that were completely irrelevant - or were of a nagging/worrying nature. My last nerve was tested, and I would say ""it's fine,"" or, ""don't worry about that right now."" It was hot, I got a little snippy, but my focus was let the kids have a great time. Overall, the outing was a hit!

Afterward, the shower situation was me telling whom to shower when, and I was the second vehicle to arrive home. Me, daughter, son, and then I did not rightly care who showered after that - but it was a Spider-Man points at another Spider-Man moment.

Dinner was leftovers.

Finally, we decide to watch a movie to end the night. Pretty basic stuff right? We begin to get situated, and FIL makes an extremely politically charged statement, and I respond firmly with, ""don't."" He laughs, asks, ""why not?"" I respond again, ""don't."" He continues to laugh and says something again, not sure what as my raging blood had closed up my ear holes, and I respond with my last, ""don't!"" We get about halfway through the movie, and not sure what was going on but the recliner needed to be adjusted where MIL was, and she couldn't get it for right for, I don't know, maybe 10 seconds, and once she got it going she lowered it and ran away to have a fit. Eff that, I am not taking this BS anymore and she is behaving poorly in front of the kids. I follow after her, knock on the door and barge in. She is frantic and crazy eyed, and I said you need to stop. She goes on about I don't have restless leg syndrome and blah blah blah. Not kind of me, but I said, ""Give me a break, MIL. Knock it off right now. This is ridiculous."" She starts shouting at me as I leave, and I say ""whatever, MIL"" repeatedly as I walk down the hallway. I'm not taking it and NO ONE ELSE has called them out. I sit, and who comes back right behind me? Shocking, all it took was to tell her she's being whacky for her to get her ass in line.

**Day Seven:** The day is gloomy, but everyone begins early. FIL and MIL have scheduled time to see an elderly family member in the early afternoon, so everything circles around that and them getting ready to leave. In the interim, FIL blurts out expletives about people he doesn't like (politically). Ok? Get your panties out of a twist, my dude. MIL starts talking about nothing, as usual. At one point MIL gets flustered about something and does that temper tantrum thing for an hour. 

My husband and I took the free day to clean up the garage so I can find things easier and make more space for things we actually need to hold on to. He and I talked about his parents, and I admitted that the air of negativity, lack of respect of us and our things in our homes, and the bad attitude of both of them has weighed me down all week.  

Again, I refused to cook dinner as I did enough and the pre-planned meal required work that they would need to help me with OR they would complain about it, so my husband got them to agree to go out to dinner. The kids wanted to go to a certain restaurant, and unfortunately I had to veto the decision due to food options for me. This upset my youngest and put him in a mood while dining, so knowing they were going with my in-laws all day the next day, I said ""hey, maybe you can go there tomorrow for lunch."" The kids both got excited, and MIL straight up says, ""Oh, we are not really fans of \[that place\], but maybe we can go to \[another place\]."" Dude, read the room! My son starts looking dejected again and \*ahem ahem\*, MIL, \*ahem ahem\* - me looking at her, eyeing him, looking at her, eyeing him - she will NOT SHUT UP. ""MIL, they really like \[that place\] and I cannot eat there. I think you should, I don't know, consider what the kids want since you did tell them you would take them to lunch 'wherever they want to go.'"" After dinner, which was split and they did not pay for any of us, FIL brings up going to an ice cream shop. I said no, 1. It was getting late and my son had something scheduled for early the next morning, and 2. It was late and I didn't want them having that much sugar, and 3. I would not be partaking and would have to sit there and watch everyone eat ice cream when we have ice cream at home. FIL kind of pokes at my husband, and I get asked again, so I got snippy with my husband. I apologized to him later, and it wasn't a good look, but FIL and MIL were being negative and rude the WHOLE DINNER and I was just trying not to lash out. Anyway, so FIL keeps talking to the kids and saying things like, ""but where in the rules does it say we can't have ice cream this late? Who says we can't have ice cream two days in a row? Where is it written that...."" You get it.

Everyone went to bed, except me, and I played video games while listening to podcasts until the wee hours of the night. Finally, a little reprieve.

**Day Eight:** We all get up early, hubby returns to work and I take our son to his morning event. I dropped him off and gave instructions to my in-laws about pick up. Then I drove to see my dad a few hours away, along with my sister, to address his continuing care plan and all of that. It was a long day of driving, but it felt less stressful than being around the in-laws all day. It was welcomed stress, or stress for stress replacement.

I get home right around bedtime for the kids, all is right with the world. About 30 minutes later, I had to inform in-laws and hubby they were being loud and I could hear them way back in our bathroom. The rest of them turn in, and I couldn't make out what the in-laws were saying as I typed away in my office, but I heard ""she"" and ""well I"" or ""just ignore her."" Lovely to hear what is quiet possibly shit talk about me. Eff them at this point. They leave the next day and I take solace in knowing my nightmare is almost over.

**Day Nine:** Eventus Finitus. I don't think that's a real saying, but final event!!! 

I drop off my son again, return home and start to work on small business stuff that have been put on the backburner while ""they"" were here. I am listening to my podcasts in my office while working, and the sound was through the speakers so it was obvious that I was in here doing stuff. While packing, MIL kept coming to my office and asking me questions, and then when I answer she starts talking. I unpause my podcast and keep working. She shows up again, rinse and repeat from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM. They said they were leaving at noon, so I inform my daughter that I have to pick up her brother and the grandparents may or may not leave while I am away. Shocker! They were still here when I arrived. Hubby came home for lunch, my son and I get in, and I immediately get a phone call from my ailing dad. Luckily, I was on the phone for so long that I didn't have to say good-bye to my in-laws.

That evening (yesterday), my daughter informs me of several things that happened behind my back and that took this from just an unbearable situation with people that do not jive well with me to a WTF was I thinking being nice to these people!!

1. While I was helping my husband and FIL was going to get groceries, he asked MIL if he should get tomatoes for the salad. My daughter yelled out, ""no tomatoes are allowed"" from the homeschool room. She then said he made an exhaustive sound and a slight ok before leaving the house. Tomatoes. We asked on Tuesday that they not do this, and by Friday he was toying with the idea of bringing my number one no-no food into the home.

2. When in-laws took the kids shopping for ice cream, it was my daughter that brought up getting me a tiny ice cream and explained why. She stated that he was looking up and down, squinting trying to find the flavor she mentioned, and apparently it was right in front of his face. She grabbed it, put it in the cart, and said FIL definitely acted like he was shocked and not actually shocked that he ""didn't see it.""

3. A few days back, MIL offered to buy things that they had used, like paper towels and TP, which I said please don't as I stocked up and I will have nowhere to put it. It's the same thing as buying things that we already have, which was brought up earlier in the week and I thought that was pretty clear - apparently not. I literally said, ""please don't do that because..."" Well, of course before they left she told me they bought TP, soft because my ""daughter said that's the one she wanted."" I asked my daughter about it, and she said that is not what happened. They went shopping, and MIL asked her what kind of TP we buy. Daughter asked if we even needed it as she heard me say we didn't need it, and MIL said ""well I am getting it anyway,"" before MIL then puts the soft kind in the cart. We don't use soft... we use strong. I said don't do it.... she did it anyway. I am being forced to use TP we don't like now because she just had to replace it. Yea... sure... I think this was a final F U to me and I am not here for it.

I hope they read this, and maybe I'll email it to them as I have zero intention of ever uttering another word to them for the rest of my life. I will also never send my kids to visit them alone, never, ever, again. My husband will be required to be present at all times now that I know how malicious they can be, and you cannot guarantee that level of selfishness won't be taken out on the kids at some point.

To FIL and MIL. You were rude to me in my home. You were disrespectful to me in my home, and blatantly to my face. You made uncomfortable in my own living space, and seemingly on purpose. You purposefully tried to circumvent all of my rules because you didn't like them - fun fact, that's how it goes in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME. Your relationship with my husband will hinge on him, not me. I already told him my boundaries, and that includes you never being in my house while I am around. You should be ashamed, but I know you aren't because your feelings and feel-goods matter more to you than the safety of your family members or rules put in place because it is our house. I have never done that to you in your home, and never would I be so downright nasty in the ways you have been to me over the years. This is a farewell, because of all of the people in my life that I have had to kicked out, this has been a long time coming. I will not miss you. 

So long, and thanks for all of the fish.

It has been particularly harder at work. I easily get overstimulated and thrown into a snappy mood. However, with therapy and from years of ~trying to be the better person~, I’ve learned that distancing myself away is the better option. Everybody’s been thrown off by how I’ve been the past 2 days. Everybody has had to stop by and check in on me, offering to buy me lunch or coffee to sit down and talk (which I truly appreciate). I just don’t like it because I feel like I’m making them uncomfortable. 

The other struggle is I’m a nurse working at a hospital. I’ve been good at maintaining and flipping my mood and demeanor whenever I go inside the patient’s room and interacting with them (this has always been a top priority for me). But I feel its toll creeping up on me now where I get extremely physically exhausted after each shift.

I have not told anyone about me starting HRT, nor do I have the intention to. (I’ve only opened up to selected, special people).

Went for my first interview recently for a salaried posting. Many applicants were interviewed. I’ve been offered the position but I’m weighing up the pros and cons of the job. 

-It’s a big practice around 30k patients, with 6 partners, 10 salarieds and some registrars. 

-Recruits ARRS roles but this job is employed solely by the practice not PCN.

-Has its own HV team of ANPs so HVs are low for GPs. It’s a training practice.

-Daily Doctor coffee catch up time

-Own gym on site 

-Supports special interests

-Indemnity covered by practice

-Mix of F2F/ tele appts. 12-15 patients in a list (think they have review slots)

-Low docman workload. Do own admin

-Pay is by hour (not session). It’s roughly £47/hour for a NQ. This is on basis of around 38 hours a week for the position they’re offering I’ve calculated. 

-4 days a week- 8.30am to 6.30pm. But one day is shorter due to CPD time. Not clear if actually need to remain on site until this time (I.e. if finish list early)

-On calls on Fridays and expected to be part of rota for extended hours commitment (finishes 8pm on a friday for this)
 
-Will supervise ARRS as part of role.

Any advice would be much appreciated for the above, have a few other interviews in pipeline so not sure on whether to hold fire or commit based on this role?

Amir Coffee has been in the league for six years after being undrafted.  Signed a two way deal with the Clippers after the draft and has been with them ever since.  Listed at 6 7 in shoes with a 6 8 wingspan he isn't enormous or anything but a perfectly reasonable sized SG/SF.  Additionally he's a solid/good athlete with no imminent age cliff as he's still only 27 years old.

  
Offensively one thing that is really on Amir's favor is his shooting numbers.  Stellar true shooting % in back to back years with only 22-23 and his rookie year being below 50%.  This is partially because he isn't asked to shoot that much but 38% on 2.6 attempts and 41% on 3.4 attempts indicate he might be able to shoot more if asked to.  Especially since he seems to be willing to shoot with people in his space. Does a lot of his work corner to the wing (shot fake dribble to the wing type thing) like a typical 3 and D guy.  He's also a player who got hit ahead passes for the Clippers in transition.  It's nice he's looking to run but we'd probably want to give the ""pass it to Giannis in transition"" talk.  Not going to create off the dribble much but has standard straight line finishes/pull ups in the bag.  

  
Defensively our guy Amir has a lot to like.  With that 6 7 frame and good lateral/vertical movement he has the tools to be a good defender.  Lucky for us is he knows how to use those tools to defend up and down the spectrum.  He doesn't put up good block/steal numbers but I'm not terribly worried about that.   In the minutes I watched he was guarding his name intelligently, switching when he should be, and generally looked sound in the defensive structure for the Clippers.  He fits very well into switching lineups as well as more base drop coverages.

  
Overall Amir Coffee doesn't get a lot of shine but in my analysis of him I liked him more and more.  He's obviously a 3 and D player but if he can be coaxed to shoot a big more he could have a big value increase playing with the Bucks.  Definitely somebody I'll have my eye on and will be very happy if they can snag this two way gem",7,1748540946.0,MkeBucks,3,0.89,False

1kyh7fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1kyh7fq/none_of_the_side_hustle_options_that_fit_my/,None of the side hustle options that fit my background seem worth the time you put in.,"I’d like to highlight my background really quick to demonstrate what I might be looking for:

I have a bachelors degrees in History and English, with a focus in creative writing. I am a voracious reader and a lifelong writer, both academically and personally (fiction). I also am a certified TESOL (teaching English to speakers of other languages) instructor, but I’m currently not using it for anything. 

Right now, I’m a barista that gets paid pretty well ($24~hr after tips) but I’m only working 33hr a week on average due to shift lengths. 

I had an idea of getting a second job, either part-time as a server, maybe even tending bar somewhere at night (the skill carry-over from my current job may help), or even just working a front desk at a gym (I’ve done that in the past and it would allow me to work on personal projects, but would probably pay dick). My only concern is that doubling up on jobs will zap any free-time I have left and overall just make me miserable, but it would only be until September (I’m trying to save another $3k MINIMUM before I move abroad). 

So far, my side hustle ideas are as follows: 

- History/English tutor for high schoolers in my area. I’m qualified in this, and tutoring in person means I could charge more, but right now I don’t know how to network myself. 

- TESOL tutor. I’m uniquely qualified for this, as I have the additional post-graduate certification. But I’d likely have to find clients through an online service like iTalki that, on top of being oversaturated and paying low, also takes a cut on top of dismal hourly rates. 

- freelance writing. I’m a great writer, but I have no portfolio and don’t know much about the technical/business writing where the money is. Plus, I’d be navigating a minefield of scams just to hope for a shot in the most oversaturated gig-field of all time. 

- commission-based writing. This is…porn. It would be smut writing. I don’t want to do this because it feels akin to sex work, and I’d rather not pour my creative juices into making fetish content on a cents per word basis. I also don’t know how good the money is here, and I tried to do it once and had someone ask me for some…very strange stuff. Not clutching my pearls over it, but I just realized that I wouldn’t be able to take myself seriously. 

- second jobs. I already mentioned these. I’m either working morning shifts (06:30-13:00) or evening shifts (12:00-18:00) during the week, and usually working from 07:00-17:00 on weekends, so it would be a doable deal to have a second job waiting tables or hosting at a restaurant or even being a bartender. I’d just be dealing with big potential for burnout in how full my plate would be and I don’t know the logistics of two jobs since I haven’t done that before. I also don’t know about my experience. I’ve worked in kitchens, offices, front desk jobs, and a few coffee shops. But I’ve never waited tables or tended an actual bar. Idk what it would be like. 

Plus the main reason I wanted to leverage a digital side hustle with my actual background is the reason I need more money to start: travel. I have much greater travel ambitions that I previously did and I want to realize them this year. Money helps. 

My other option I can think of is throwing on an audiobook and driving DoorDash or Uber eats, but that doesn’t seem anymore worth it (maybe more of a money sinkhole due to gas cost and potential car costs).

1kyh48e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFP/comments/1kyh48e/dont_know_where_else_to_turn/,Don't Know Where Else To Turn,"**TL;DR** I'm 33M, looking for a financial advisor mentor, preferably based west coast but I mean, I'll take anything lol. 

**The background:**

I transitioned from a decade long career in marketing at entertainment and tech startups to join my mother's solo practice. She's been trying to get me to join since before I graduated college and I was always resistant to the idea of working with her, primarily because I wanted to gain financial independence and didn't want her having any say in the way I live my life. Anyways, I got jaded with startup culture after reaching the career milestones I aimed for and wanted to do something more meaningful, so here I am. 

It's been roughly 1.5 years since I started working for her, primarily as a RA and marketer. I just completed my Series 66 and Series 7 to become a full-fledged advisor/IAR and I'm ready to start bringing in clients and build my own book of business. However, while my mother is a great advisor to clients, she's not the best manager and is not really the best at nurturing talent/developing employees. She's more ""old school,"" and doesn't grasp the value/urgency of creating frameworks, optimizing processes, or learning new tech. It's just me and her in the office and I feel like we argue at least 3x/week.

Lately I've been asking questions about prospecting best practices, developing financial plans, mapping out what a nurture cycle would look like for different ICPs. Every conversation feels like pulling teeth and no matter how I frame the question, I can't seem to get a clear answer. Ultimately, I've realized I need to find another mentor in this space if I want to become better at what I do. I'm hungry and willing to grind, I just need direction.

**What I'm looking for in a mentor (wish list, not mandatory):**

* An established advisor/founder, someone who runs a small office, isn't just a solo practice. Reason being this is the direction I want to take the business in.
* S7, S66 IAR because a lot of the work I'll be doing will be a mix of fee-based planning, wealth management, and insurance
* Someone who prides themselves on being tech-forward, ops-optimized, and solution-oriented

1kyh30v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1kyh30v/oat_milk_allergy/,Oat Milk Allergy?,"Hi all, I have quite a few food allergies (peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, avocado, other weird ones). The ones that arent nuts tend to just give me nausea and vomiting for a few hours. A few months ago, I ate a bowl of cereal with oat milk and started vomiting soon after. A few weeks later I then (stupidly) got oat milk in my coffee and I felt super nauseous but didn't vomit, so i just figured it was another weird allergy to add to the list. Yesterday though, I got food at a vegan restaurant; a wrap and a brownie. The wrap had none of my allergens, and the brownie had some oat milk (I called and asked after my reaction). Ate the wrap, had a bite of the brownie. A few minutes later, my throat started feeling tight and sore, my chest got tight, I was sweating profusely, had vomiting and diarrhea and almost passed out. I didnt have my Epi pen so my friends drove me to the ED. After about an hour, I got better spontaneously (no epi, i puked up the benadryl). I'm kind of at a loss here, the brownie turned out to have some oat milk but I'm confused why I had such a severe reaction. 

  
Has this happened to anyone else? I can eat oatmeal with absolutely no problem. It just seems so strange. It's possible the wrap was cross contaminated, but this place is pretty good with allergens and such and my reactions usually arent so severe. ",1,1748540520.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

The fact there are people trying to get the US government to use taxpayer money to buy Bitcoin is disgusting. These same assholes are the ones that turn around and complain whenever they hear about their taxes going towards real things that help society like healthcare, roads, public programs, etc.

The hypocrisy is beyond disgusting and the greed is toxic to an insane degree.

Let's start with that I'm a very logical person. At some point I didn't believe in gods and entities that did not have any coherent logical reason, I like mythology especially greek and Norse and see them as parts or fragments of the past. 
However! As I grew up I HATED SPIDERS. but I don't want to kill them I fear them. They always jumpscare me since I was a child, I had a vivid memories that they would fall on me during times I cried in the shower or run up the stairs chasing me when I got back home. A random spider always appearing in my room despite all my doors and windows closed and usually they be chilling close to my headboard or under my bed. I also am taking a science related course and my university sits in the middle of a forest.... Not unusual to find things here right?

But big ass forest spiders. Tree spiders. I will the lottery to stumble upon them when I'm just trying to go home from the lab. Snakes appearing when I'm crossing the street and ect. Sightings of insects and wild animals aren't rare but if you asked a student how many times have they seen a chilling spider in a usually vacant tree in the middle of the park on a random Wednesday it's not 
Really supposed to exceed your fingers.

And cobwebs everywhere. I clean and dust on my good days (atleast once. A week as I'm a busy person but I do throughout cleaning on  good days unless I'm mentally unwell and I rot in my room for a month or so.)

My interest in loki got more fiery around highschool and marvel Loki despite yes being a fictional character got me hooked further as he represents my favourite Norse aesier. Then rick Riordan books and I god interested in it especially on the Magnus chase series upon knowing that Loki is represented in it.

I also liked burning stuff. Not the arson kind the I would cook something  sweet and had the habit to chuck it into the fire because it felt right. 

(I'm sorry if I'm quite scatter brained I'm trying to pull out as much info as I can to help you guys understand or curate a response to my post)

Now all this came to a curious conversation this year around march. I have good friends that introduced me to diety worshiping. And one of them suggested that maybe Loki was reaching out to me this whole time. So given my family history which used to be told to me during bedtime by my late mother as practitioners of spiritual customs I tried asking, and  praying for signs. After almost a decade of turning my back to worshiping any diety as my life always felt like it was some god's sandbox. 

So I tried learning about my favourite god again, Loki. Reread everything that is left and are existing of their folk and history. Norse stories archives of what humans have found of their existence. 

Then slowly I built them a small altar in my room and lit my first candle. Researched on what people noticed they like as offerings.

The next part this is where I am confused and hope to ask guidance for 

I'm unsure of the feeling. I am a logical person but I trust my gut as it felt right at times. And my dreams are most of the times so accurate it's scary (took a test even when I was younger and got the wrong answers on my dream right and perfected an exam)
For their altar I tried to go with a gut feeling looking for a small plate for their offerings and I was amazed when it felt like I was lead to a shop where it only sold these small plates in an emerald green color. Then a red toy car felt like a nice touch. Their is this kind of pull towards me on some days to buy a gold pen , ect.
Food offerings I would usually make coffee for them with cinnamon on Saturdays or share my food when it felt like ""hmm.... Does my dear god want some?"" 
Nuggets, chocolates , food I cook, ect. But yes it's always the savory and the sweet ones that felt like oh I should burn it on their offering plate.

And when I started praying to them for guidance and working through research on tiktok and other platforms (I know tiktok is not reliablet most times,  but my birdbrain had to learn somewhere)
I started dabbling on prayers and sigils

tried to learn basic sigil making and spells. Trying with the extent of my knowledge on younger futhark and old Norse to make genuine prayers in form of sigils...

Ever since seeking guidance from them life has been a slight roller coaster but it didn't feel as heavy as before, the spidersssss THE SPIDERS THEY'RE GONE OR JUST SMALL BECAUSE I HOPE IT IS IT THOUGH. THE FIRST PRAYER I UTTERED TO THEM WAS TO PLEASE IF HE WANTS TO SEND SIGNA JUST SMALL SPIDERS.

But dear lord at one time I travelled and had to leave my place for long the night before I left A BIG ASS SPIDER THE SIZE OF MY HAND SNEAKED INTO MY ROOM I ALMOST FAINTED. BUT I realized maybe if it was Loki's work was it their way to protect my place because I was to leave? 
(I apologise after returning from my trip upon Realizing this, because honestly the panic attack I almost had made me slightly resent them thinking they're pulling something like a prank on me after I said no spiders)

There are days when I do cleansing spells and such when I try to feel or look for their presence I feel this mix of yearing for warmth and warmth at the same time. It feels empty like whatever feels cold I have the need to place warmth to it with a gesture or a hug, and at the same time it feels like it is me that needs it. 

So yes... This is I guess me sharing my experience and also asking to those who worship them and those who worship other dieties if I'm on the right track?",1,1748539998.0,NorsePaganism,0,1.0,False

Looking to get a projector for nightly tv/movie viewing in my living room.

Some ambient light, but it’s a pretty dark room. I know a TV would be cheaper/better but that’s not an option for my space.    

-budget is more important to me than absolute highest quality, but I’d like bang for my buck. Willing to spend up to 1k, but would prefer closer to $600 or so. I don’t want to mess around with used or refurbished stuff, which I know is what is often recommended at this price point.

So I had a crush on that girl, and asked to get a coffee after she came to my party. She said she'd lmk but never did, which honestly has been more of a relief than anything, just feels good for that crush to go.

But I've been talking to this girl a little recently, who ik finds me attractive because my friend told me that at her party this girl said she wanted to fuck me. Which boosted my ego honestly, and then later that night that friend told me she used to have a crush on me. It's not reciprocated (she's just not my type) so I handled it not great lmao, didn't know what to say so I just like ""wow that's mad"". Anyway me and this girl have been talking a bit recently and I went to see her sing on stage at the big carnival thing my uni puts on. And me and my friend after hung out w her and the friend she sung with, went on a ride, but she had to leave right after because she had work. But me and my mate still hung out with her friend afterwards, went on the couple other rides and chatted shit about ppl lmao. 

But her friend has since messaged me on Insta and we talked a bit, and I recommended a game I like yesterday. And then I'm pretty sure she said I should let her watch me play it sometime. Which feels like a weird thing for her to say - unless she's into me. And I don't wanna read into it because I know I'm not good with this stuff, but I told a few friends and they all agreed. And anyway I'm sorta gaslighting myself because I'm not 100% sure that's what she said (I haven't opened the message, because I didn't know what to say, I just saw it on the notification). But everything feels really awkward, because I only know this girl finds me attractive because my friend who had a crush on me told me, so if anything happened between me and this girl it could be awkward. And know it feels more awkward because I feel like her friend may have a thing for me. And idrk what to do.

And also the girl messaged me again yesterday but I haven't opened it at all because I'd feel weird messaging her back but not her friend.",1,1748539850.0,adultsnew,0,1.0,False

A smile bloomed on her face. Two hours until she needed to be at Essel Inc. Plenty of time to prepare for another day of spreading joy. Unlike so many others who secretly – or not so secretly – loathed their jobs and referred to their workplaces with less-than-flattering nicknames, Ela genuinely loved her position. She wasn’t stuck in some soul-crushing corporate “turkey”; she was a Liaison of Happiness.

She bounced out of bed, the spring in her step a reflection of the enthusiasm bubbling within her. First, coffee. The rich aroma filled her tiny apartment, a comforting prelude to the day. While the brew dripped, she started on breakfast: ham and eggs, a classic that always seemed to set her up for success.

Fuelled and ready to face the day, Ela got dressed in a cheerful yellow blouse and a comfortable pair of slacks. As she smoothed down her hair, a sudden sneeze erupted. ""Achoo!""

She wrinkled her nose. An odd scent hung in the air, a cloying sweetness battling against the lingering aroma of her coffee. It smelled…like saliva and honey. She glanced around, bewildered. Where was that coming from? She shrugged it off, attributing it to the lingering effects of her dream.

Grabbing her bag, Ela headed out the door and drove to North Hollywood Station. The California sun beat down, warming her skin as she navigated the morning traffic. She loved taking the subway; it gave her a chance to people-watch, to observe the myriad of faces, each carrying their own stories, their own potential for happiness.

The day at Essel Inc. flew by in a flurry of positive interactions. She helped mediate a disagreement between departments, facilitated a team-building exercise that had everyone laughing, and even arranged for a surprise pizza party for a department that had exceeded its quarterly goals. She learned about philanthropic leaders like Christine Essel, President of Southern California Grantmakers, and the important work they did to support communities. She even stumbled upon information about Title I programs, designed to help children succeed in school. The sheer breadth of opportunities to make a positive impact was astounding, and it filled her with a renewed sense of purpose. She felt like she was part of something bigger, a collective effort to improve the world, one smile at a time.

Finally, as the sky began to turn a fiery orange, Ela clocked out. Her feet might have ached, and her voice might have been a little hoarse from talking all day, but her heart was full. Ela came back home happy, a contentment that settled deep within her soul. As she unlocked the door to her apartment, the faint scent of honey and saliva still lingered in the air, a strange, inexplicable footnote to a perfectly wonderful day. This time, though, she didn't wrinkle her nose. Instead, a small, knowing smile played on her lips. Tomorrow, she decided, she would investigate the source of that peculiar smell. For now, she would simply bask in the warmth of a day well-spent, a day filled with the simple, yet profound, power of happiness.",1,1748539802.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I have histamine issues, which shows as:

* Sinus inflammation (silmuteanous sinus and front teeth paint)
* Hot flashes (my neck is sometimes hot as an iron after food ingestion)
* Itchiness - my nose gets itchy, as if I have got bitten by a mosquito
* Dry skin
* Bloating

The problem is that I use coffee as so called ""digestion speeder"".

It makes any constipation go away, which relieves me from the bloating.

This allows me to redirect my energy towards productive activities.

The problem is that if it is coupled with existing histamine problems, it exacerbates them.  
Apart from that, I feel like I am playing roulette with coffee, as it is not given, that every single one is going to help me.

Sometimes I get all of the histamine problems from coffee as listed above without sinus inflammation.

I have tried to replace Coffee with Yerba Mate, switching it from brand to brand, and going from smoked to unsmoked, aged to almost non-aged (Chimarrao), and Guayusa.

Is there any possible additional factor that couild have been taken into equation?  
Should I completely quit Caffeine, as it is histamine liberator, or is there anything that would help my digestion, while raising energy levels?",1,1748539499.0,HistamineIntolerance,2,1.0,False

Ever feel like your life is just a long-running, poorly documented software project? Because that's pretty much my daily existence as a software engineer. This past week was a prime example, a true sprint through the highs and lows of the dev life.

It all started with the morning ritual. I'm definitely not a morning person, nor a night person. I'm strictly a ""**when-the-coffee-kicks-in**"" person. My brain's energy-saving mode is permanently on, much like my code, which rarely runs at full throttle if 20% can get the job done. I joke that I'm not lazy, just optimized for minimal energy consumption.

The first task of the day? A ""quick look"" at a supposedly minor bug. You know, the kind that always turns into a **3 AM debugging session**. Three hours later, I'm still staring at the screen, muttering about how this isn't a bug, it's clearly a ""**feature request**"" that just hasn't been implemented yet. It's a classic engineer move: When your code doesn't work, just rename the problem!

Then came the team meeting. Oh, the meetings. My manager, bless their heart, always asks, ""Can you just fix this one little thing?"" ""Little thing?!"" I think, ""This is a **10,000-line code refactor** we're talking about!"" Sometimes I swear the scrum master's favorite phrase is just, ""**We can do it in a sprint.**"" My personal approach to discussions often devolves into ""I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right."" It's essentially a merge conflict, but with more passionate hand-waving and less actual code.

Later, I was deep in a coding session, trying to untangle some particularly gnarly legacy code. My code is truly like a romantic relationship: it's beautiful, it's messy, and sometimes it just crashes and burns. I finally managed to fix one particularly stubborn bug, only to instantly create five more. I've started calling this a ""**productivity hack**""—more work, right? And when I eventually get something to work on the first try (a rare, celestial event), my inner monologue immediately declares, ""Wow, I'm a genius!"" But if it doesn't? ""I meant to do that."" Pure denial, my friends.

The best part about being a software engineer is the constant learning. The worst part? The constant learning. It's an endless cycle of absorbing new frameworks and then realizing you're still just ""proficient in Google-ing error messages."" Honestly, why do I need a gym membership when I can just lift my keyboard and pretend it's a dumbbell?

As the day winds down, I often reflect on the true meaning of it all. Software engineering: where ""I love my job"" is just a euphemism for ""**I love my couch**."" And while we might not have superpowers, we do have a decent understanding of algorithms. We're like magicians who make things appear... and disappear, especially our social lives.

The best way to describe a software project? ""It's like a puzzle, but with more swearing."" And the only thing more exhausting than being a software engineer is explaining what a software engineer does to your parents. (""So, you fix the internet?"")

But despite the chaos, the constant debugging, and the never-ending learning, there's a strange satisfaction when that messy code finally works. It's a beautiful, chaotic symphony, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe a full night's sleep.

1kyghws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1kyghws/replacing_carpet_in_a_rented_apartment/,Replacing carpet in a rented apartment,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice.

I’m in my mid-20s and have lived in my 2 bed, 1 bath fourplex apartment (around 950 sq ft) for 4 years now. I really like it here. It’s walking distance to downtown, coffee shops, and the farmers market. The apartment has a big living room, in-unit washer/dryer, a decent patio, and the neighbors are great. Rent is $1,265, which is about $300–$500 below market, and my landlord hasn’t raised it in 3 years. One of my neighbors has been here for over 30 years, and pays $875!! All my other neighbors have also lived here for 10+ years and definitely pay less than me. I’m happy for them - and I’m happy with the price I pay. 

My partner and I could afford to move, but we’d rather stay to save money and because we genuinely like living here. The only thing I don’t like is that the whole place is carpeted. I enjoy interior design and decorating with secondhand and vintage furniture, but the carpet makes it hard to pull things together.

I was thinking about offering to replace the carpet with laminate or vinyl plank flooring and asking for a small rent discount over a year or two to help cover the cost. My dad is a licensed contractor and could do the work properly and for a good price. I’m not trying to flip the place- I just want to make it feel more like home! and I plan to stay here for a while longer until we can save up and buy a home in the area.

Do you think this is something a landlord might go for? I’d love to hear from anyone who’s tried something like this or has advice on how to approach it. Thanks!",1,1748539138.0,Apartmentliving,2,1.0,False

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Probably smoking very regularly by 15. I’ve never quite been a pack a day smoker, but probably a pack every two days. More when I drink. I have kids now. I’m scheduled to take a physical abilities test in July for a job I really want. So this is me, using that as an excuse to do something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now: Quit smoking. For myself, for my wife and kids, I just want to kill this bad habit and get healthier for my family and for myself. 

 I over indulged on cigarettes at a party over the weekend. I often do when I have a few drinks. Where I might have 2-3 cigarettes a day normally, I might have 15-20 on a night where alcohol is involved. I always wake up the next day, not so much hungover from the alcohol, but hungover from all of the cigarettes. It makes it easy to not smoke for that day, but I always find myself feeling good enough to have one with my coffee the day after that. So this week I decided, with the test coming up and everything, why not make this the week I actually try to quit. So far, 4 days in, I feel pretty good.

1kygfvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WedditNYC/comments/1kygfvn/celestine_wedding_recap_budget_breakdown_and/,"Celestine Wedding Recap (Budget Breakdown and Vendor Reviews) | May 2025, 71 guests, $48k","Just got married at Celestine a few days ago and wanted to share my full experience in case it helps any other brides out there. I stalked this sub a LOT during planning and want to pay it forward with some info. This restaurant is recommended a lot through the sub as an all-inclusive venue with some positive reviews from vendors but I struggled to find an in-depth review from a couple so here goes. Spoiler: I would recommend them too :). 


## Background

I got engaged in May 2024 and while I desperately wanted to elope, my fiance wanted a wedding. We compromised on having a small wedding with only those closest to us. Because neither of us are religious or huge dancers (and because we go to bed early lol) we agreed on a lunch-time restaurant wedding with no dance floor. Just a quick ceremony to do our vows and chill lunch after with an option to hang out with our friends in the evening. I had always eyed Bottino as an affordable option but while it was super pretty, I didn’t completely love the idea and it didn’t seem private enough. When looking up other recommendations on this subreddit, I came across [this](https://rimabrindamour.com/intimate-wedding-at-celestine/) wedding photographed at Celestine and LOVED the vibes. We toured the venue and had dinner there and the staff were all so friendly and organized, we booked that same week.


**Budget:** We did not have a set budget in mind but I mentally did not want to surpass $50k. My goal was to keep costs on the lower end while not compromising things we wanted or guest experience. However, as you will see below, some items were definite splurges we could have gone without. Not including our wedding outfits and accessories (we paid for these out of our personal accounts and not the shared wedding fund) our total came out to around $48,000. Note: This included a splurge on a really nice room at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge, which costed more than some of our vendors, more on that in the detailed breakdown.


## Breakdown:

- **Venue: Celestine** We toured one place and booked it that same week because we just felt great about it after our tour and dinner there. When I booked, the price all-in for a Saturday was $18,000+tax and tip for lunch and $24,000+tax and tip for dinner. This price included 70 guests and 3 vendor meals. Since we had 71 guests and 6 vendor meals, our total for a Saturday lunch was $26,279.66.
    - I just have to say everything I read about Celestine on here was true. This was the PERFECT venue for a chill intimate wedding. They are so organized in the planning process, and them being inclusive of food, open bar and 90% of the decor made my life SO much easier. Plus they are just so kind. I can’t tell you how many times guests told me the service was amazing and that they kept the food and drink flowing. There was not a single hiccup in the way they transitioned from ceremony to cocktail hour to each moment in the reception. And by the time it was time for breakdown, they had already boxed up everything for us - including a meal for my husband and I since they noticed we didn’t eat! If you’re considering them, I highly recommend. 
    - I will say I’m not a HUGE fan of the rain plan just being inside since the whole appeal is the ceremony under the bridge but I understand it’s the best thing they can do. The days leading up to the wedding I was so so stressed and just wanted my ceremony to be on the terrace. I got my wish but we had such an unseasonably cold May in NYC, I was freezing!! All in all I’m just glad the rain held off. 
- **Photo + Video: Ian Kim Studio** We booked Ian for our engagement shoot and loved working with him/our results, so booked him again. Photo + Video (2 shooters) for 5 hours was $4300. Since I paid the final balance in cash, I received a discount for a total of $4000. He is easy to work with and my personal preference is I like his nostalgic editing style! Also - I hate posed photos and while I still took some for the sake of it, I love that Ian’s style includes a lot of candids. We got our sneak peeks and the candid shots are my favorite :). For some semblance of privacy, [here’s](https://imgur.com/a/o7sjVUf) a photo without our faces visible. 
- **Florals: Elan Flowers** Since Celestine is surrounded by so much greenery, and includes beautiful seasonal bud vases, and since we had no bridal party, I didn’t feel like I had to go crazy with florals. The only thing I needed was a bouquet and boutonniere, and my now-husband later requested two floral arrangements for the ceremony. We worked with Elan Flowers (initially because a coworker with good taste recommended them, then because they were the most consistently timely in their replies), who was able to put together a custom small package for us. The cost of the bouquet, boutonniere and arrangements set up / breakdown and delivery came out to $2,035.96. Communication and delivery were prompt and seamless and I LOVED my flowers. We used the arrangements next to the sweetheart table after the ceremony which I highly recommend. [Pics here](https://imgur.com/a/sKqLHQi)
- **DJ + Photobooth: Stem Productions** I think I saw a recommendation for Stem Productions on reddit somewhere so reached out and Steve’s was the most organized and prepared DJ company we spoke to. I loved the process of working with this vendor very much, he has the whole process figured out. Although we didn’t want a dance party vibe which is what they usually do, the DJ we ended up getting assigned understood the vibe we wanted perfectly. The photobooth was also one of my favorites I’ve used and I’m not just saying that because it was my wedding. We got a lot of compliments on both the DJ and Photobooth from our guests. The best part is, since it was a chill event, Steve said they could just hook up to the house system and lowered the price of the package for us - down to $2,655. Note: This also included MC services and mic set-up for ceremony and speeches and they put together a photobook of all photobooth strips for you to take home.
- **Hair and Makeup: Tatiana Li Brides Hair and Makeup Artistry** Amazing. I HATE when I don’t look like myself after makeup and people said I could probably do it myself but I didn’t want that stress on the day. My hair and makeup artist was Mable and I loved both my trial and wedding day hair and makeup so much. It was so natural and I didn’t even feel it on my face. I also asked for a few changes on the day and she did it seamlessly. I paid for the Basic Bride Pro package where your artist follows you for 2 hours after the getting ready time which was great since I needed a touch up after our emotional ceremony (although this package was splurge #1). Mable was also kind enough to help my sister-in-law with a hair clip malfunction and to quickly apply some concealer on my husband. Highly recommend this team. The total for the package + trial with taxes and travel fees came out to $1,338. 
- **Live Painter: Greer Linksvayer** Ok splurge item #2 but I have ZEROOO regrets. She is AMAZING. So so talented but also so so sweet and kind. Art has been my hobby since I was a child and this was the ONE thing I wanted at my wedding and I loved it. The live painting also served as a great thing for guests to chat about as they moved around the terrace and mingled (in lieu of a traditional dance floor). I booked the emerald package which came out to $3,100, but there are smaller or larger packages. In progress shot of our painting [here](https://imgur.com/a/ReIR83p).
- **Cake: Molly’s Cupcakes** Kind of a splurge but not really since the price wasn’t too high in my opinion for how good the cake was. Celestine’s price all-in includes a dessert, but my husband wanted a cake to cut and cupcakes of various flavors for guests to enjoy and take home. He ended up working with Molly’s and while communication over email was kind of spotty, they were super sweet and let us do two tastings (one in May for seasonal flavors.) Delivery was also seamless and they matched our inspiration picture perfectly. Price of custom 9inch cake + 96 cupcakes + delivery came out to $567. [Sorry I don’t have a better picture of the cake!](https://imgur.com/a/ArijRN8)
- **Day of Coordinator (DOC): Mostest** Ok.. I know they have conflicting reviews on this subreddit. Let me just say while Celestine provides a venue coordinator, they require a ceremony coordinator (though this can just be a family member or friend). We decided to just get a low cost day of coordinator to meet that requirement since we didn’t want any family members “working” on the day. That search led me to Mostest which had a 5 hour DOC package for $757. After I had paid the deposit, I started reading some bad reviews on here and allegations of fake positive reviews. I considered eating the loss on the deposit and paying for another coordinator but I was so close to the date and didn’t have the mental energy to look for a new vendor so I took the chance. Well, the coordinator we were assigned was AMAZING. We met 3 weeks out and she immediately relieved so much of my stress - from handling all vendor contact from that point on, thinking of logistics I didn’t even know about, printing ceremony scripts, handling delivery and set up on the day, and just being our go-to person day of whenever we needed something. She truly made my day so much less stressful and made everything else I planned go smoothly, and to top it all off she even left a card and a gift! I don’t know if I would recommend Mostest as a whole since you can’t pick your DOC (though I think that has changed), but I would FOR SURE recommend the coordinator we had if there is a way to choose (Dana Greto).
- **Hotel: 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge** Ok definitely a splurge but with a morning ceremony I wanted to be closeby and at ease. I splurged on a skyline suite and connecting room for my sister to stay in so she could help me morning of (and so my husband had a room to change in while I got ready.) This was a pretty penny for 2 nights coming in at $5,258.88 but to me it was worth the splurge. My makeup artist and photographer had worked here before so it was convenient that they knew where to park or where to take photos already. It was also really nice to enjoy some coffee with the window open the next morning. Some [pics](https://imgur.com/a/fM9PDbC) I took of the view. It was a nice touch that they left us some Prosecco and macarons the night before!
- **Miscellaneous: Wedding Bands, Signage, etc** We got our wedding bands from etsy and Ferkos for a total of $1,380.2. We also got a welcome sign, seating chart, vow books and loved ones sign for a total of $393.45. My brother officiated the ceremony at Celestine but we got legally married at city hall on our dating anniversary earlier in the week, which costed $60 for the license and later civil ceremony. 

**Budget total: $47,825**


Overall, I LOVED my wedding day despite the overcast skies and cold weather. I loved having my nearest and dearest all in one room and am so glad my husband convinced me to have a wedding. For those brides out there who are doubting themselves or their choices, just go for it. Your guests know you and love YOU for you and will enjoy the day. We got so many compliments and comments that our touch was in everything and that was all I really wanted. And shout out to all my vendors for making the day run as smoothly as it did.

Im an Italian lad and I've always wanted to move to another country and I have a sweet spot in my heart for Scotland. The culture, food, history and of course the beautiful accent are something that I really want to study.

But since I'm interested in moving to Scotland, how easy/hard is it for a foreign to start working in Scotland?  
Here in Italy it's a bit hard but doable and almost impossible for foreigns to work. In my region some people won't even hire you if you're from a different region...  
I've studied to become an electrician but I've discovered that I love working in close proximity with people and I have around 5 years of experience as a waiter in cocktail bars and coffee shops.

I can speak English fluently (C1 level) and I understand the scottish accent, mainly thanks to the Limmy's Show, so I have no problem with a possible language barrier.

I know that a UK work Visa is required to start working and I have a couple of friends that moved to London and they found a job quite easily there BUT I must add that this happened before Brexit.

And I have a final question, is it easy to find a small flat for rent in Edinburgh and its surrounding?

I've had many adventures trying to find a flat here in Italy and after a year or two I still haven't found an appartment that was not intended for tourists (prices can reach the 2k euro per month for a hole in the wall mainly because people with money can just rent the place for the summer).

I left the protestant church years ago due to the doctrine of an eternal torture chamber that most of creation would end up in, plus a few other things. 
I met with the sisters a few years ago, then quit for a bit. After a few months I asked Heavenly Father to send them back to me. They came to my door the very next day (that gave me chills), then, some things still bothered me, so I quit meeting with them again. Yes, I can be hard headed! 

Months later I told Heavenly Father if that's the church you want me in, have them contact me again, and I promised  Him that I would listen this time. Two days later, the Elders came to my door. 

I now believe in the Church with my whole heart and I love the Book of Mormon. I also believe in ongoing revelation, and there are still prophets today. 

I have set my baptism in 8 weeks, to have time to get some things taken care of. I smoke and will be using nicotine patches to step down slowly, plus I know Heavenly Father will help me. 
The coffee will be easier.

1kygcp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kygcp2/im_so_confused/,I’m so confused,"Two years ago I(26f) met someone who well call J (27m) while I was in a toxic relationship..
I knew the relationship I was in was toxic and after getting to know the new guy in a work environment I asked one of my other colleagues (47m) why I cant be with someone like him instead of my toxic partner.. His advice was that I can.. I then told J that I was interested in getting to know him better, his response was that I need to sort out my current relationship first(he also knew it was toxic tbh everyone knew)..

I sort my sh.t out, moved in with my friend and then I guess I started dating J.. It was magical, it was so good that it scared me and I ended up pushing him away, but every time he would pull back harder.. after a year we decided to move in together and it was going great! But one day he snapped at me bear in mind that this was the perfect relationship we never fought never spoke in a disrespectful way to each other..

Till this day, he was under stress he just came back from visiting his grandmother who was in the hospital he was gone for a few days (in the town he grew up in) I couldn’t go with as I had to work and it was sudden.. When I told him I couldn’t go he seemed okay with it..

After he came back he was different.. and it felt like everything started crumbling from there.

One of our mutual friends and I started talking more because of this, and I then started getting feelings for this friend.. BUT I never acted on it.. and stopped talking to the friend..

I felt so bad about what happened I wanted to tell J with everything inside of me… but I couldn’t…
I didn’t want him to hate me and things were already bad.. I instead asked him to move out(it was my place and in my name)..

He still loved with me for a month while he was looking for a place, it was hard but I managed..

We spoke about still being in a relationship even though he is moving out…

On his last day of living with me we had a few drinks and he then told me that he was talking to someone else and that broke me completely(I know it sounds contradicting)

I then asked him to please leave.. and he did..
He kept trying to see me but I just couldn’t..

After a few months we went to the same work event and when I saw him my heart melted and I realised again how much I love him..

After the event he sent me a message and said if I’m up for having a coffee with him I should let him know…

After a week or so I invited him for drinks and we had a good time, we went for a drive and he gave me his phone to play music… then a message came through and I asked him who it is… he told me and he showed me the chat…

He talked to her more than he ever talked to me.. but he assured me that it was nothing and she lives very far away..

I was broken again… I felt like the only reason he is not with her is because of the distance..
I asked him to take me home and I told him that I want him to be happy..

I couldn’t stop thinking about him, when I closed my eyes I saw his face..

But it really did seem like he was happy and doing well without me..

So I tried to move on…

That was a mistake cause it made everything worse, and he found out that I moved on and he was angry with me…

I ended the relationship before it really even started because of how I felt..

I then asked him if we can please talk, and I told him how I felt and how much I still love him..

He told me that he couldn’t be with me at this stage.. This happened a month ago…

Since then he has invited me to his place offered to help me with things I needed taken care of..(ps he doesn’t know I ended my relationship)but I thought it was obvious…

I then invited him over a few times but he was busy or tired (excuses)

I then told him that his behaviour was convulsing me, I don’t understand if he is trying to be my friend or more..

His response was that he doesn’t want to see me.. 

Unless its work related..

I then thanked him for his honesty and I told him that I will leave him alone….

A week later and he is messaging me? I have no idea what to do or what to think.
(We haven’t been intimate since he moved out).

This is really hard for me..

In November I got 5.7 and my PCP kind of encouraged me to do less carbs. I took it very seriously and cut down my rice consumption to 1/3. Note that, I did not give up rice (still would have rice for lunch and dinner), I just reduced the amount, doubled the vegetables, and added a bit more protein. I also had a good amount of red meat during this time that's why probably the LDL went up a bit? 

I have been always working out (and my protein intake was always good) but always had belly fat due to the love for the carbs. This is the first time in life since my college days I am having a super flat stomach and close to having some packs at almost 40 haha. I lost around 10 lbs (170 now, 5-10) just through the diet.

I love cookies and still had some cookies here and there but much less; replcaed cookies with the protein chips (wish they were cheaper), and nuts. Completely gave up my favorite vanilla syrup from my coffees. Alcohol stayed the same - 3-4 beers a week. 

Many information on this sub helped a lot.

Let me be 100% MITOLYN Reviews honest with you. I was tired. Burnt out. Foggy in the head. My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how many cups of coffee I drank, how many “healthy” meals I forced down, or how many hours I slept—I never truly felt like myself.

I tried everything you can imagine—expensive supplements, detox drinks, gym memberships, meditation apps… nothing worked long term.

That was until I stumbled upon something that would completely flip the switch on my health, focus, and energy.

I’m talking about **MITOLYN**.

And if you’re reading this right now, I want you to pay attention. Because this isn’t just another overhyped product. MITOLYN delivered real, tangible, life-changing results for me—and it might do the same for you.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average health supplement. It’s a scientifically formulated mitochondrial enhancer that works at a **cellular level**. While most supplements only mask the symptoms of fatigue or brain fog, MITOLYN goes straight to the root cause—**your mitochondria**, the energy factories of your cells.

When your mitochondria are sluggish, you feel sluggish. When they’re powered up, you become unstoppable.

MITOLYN is designed to **optimize mitochondrial function**, restore natural energy, sharpen focus, and improve overall vitality—without caffeine crashes or artificial junk.

# 🔬 What Happened When I Started Taking MITOLYN

Let me walk you through my personal experience, step by step.

**Day 1-3:**  
I honestly didn’t expect much at first. I took 2 capsules with my morning water. Within a couple of hours, I felt… a little clearer. A slight lift in my brain fog. I was cautiously optimistic.

**Day 4-7:**  
This is where things got exciting. I was waking up before my alarm—**without the usual grogginess**. I didn’t crave afternoon naps or extra caffeine. I actually wanted to work. I was productive, focused, and surprisingly calm under pressure.

**Week 2:**  
My body started to feel lighter, more agile. My mental clarity was through the roof. Even my digestion improved. Friends noticed I looked “fresh” and asked if I was doing something different. The **confidence boost** that came with this transformation was priceless.

**Week 3 and beyond:**  
I became a different person. **Motivated, balanced, full of life**. The fatigue that once held me back was replaced by a flow of energy that made every day feel exciting.

MITOLYN didn’t just help me feel better—it helped me perform better.

# 💡 Why MITOLYN Works (When Other Products Fail)

I’ve taken dozens of supplements over the years. Most are filled with empty promises. But MITOLYN is **backed by real science**. Here’s what makes it stand out:

* **Mitochondrial Support Formula** – It works at the cellular level, restoring the very source of your body’s energy.
* **Clean Ingredients** – No fillers, no sketchy chemicals, no artificial stimulants. Just powerful, natural compounds.
* **Zero Crash** – The energy boost is clean, consistent, and long-lasting.
* **Brain & Body Benefits** – It improves not just physical energy, but also mental clarity, mood, and focus.

The results weren’t “overnight magic,” but within days, I could tell something inside me was waking up.

# ✅ What I Love About MITOLYN

* 🧠 **Sharper foc**us – My mental clarity has never been better.
* 🔋 **Steady ener**gy – No more ups and downs or burnout.
* 💪 **Improved stami**na – I can work, exercise, and stay active longer.
* 😴 **Better sle**ep – I fall asleep faster and wake up refreshed.
* 😊 **Mood boo**st – I feel calmer, happier, and more optimistic.

MITOLYN gave me **the energy I forgot I once had**—and reminded me that I’m capable of more than I ever believed.

# 🙋‍♂️ Is MITOLYN Worth It?

YES. Every single penny.

If you’re tired of wasting money on cheap supplements that do nothing…  
If you’re sick of dragging yourself through your days feeling like a shell of yourself…  
If you want to feel young, alive, and mentally sharp again…

Then MITOLYN is **exactly** what you need.

It’s not hype. It’s not fluff. It’s real transformation—from the inside out.

# ⚠️ Warning: Don’t Buy Fake MITOLYN

Because of how well this product works, I’ve seen copycat sellers and knockoffs floating around online. Be **very careful**. Always purchase directly from the official website to avoid fake or expired products.

# 💬 Final Words – My Honest Recommendation

If you’ve read this far, you’re probably someone who’s ready to feel better, live better, and perform at your best.

You deserve more than just “getting through the day.”  
You deserve energy, focus, and vitality that empowers you to thrive.

MITOLYN gave me my life back.

It helped me think clearer, move faster, and live happier—**all without any nasty side effects**.

If you’re still hesitating… let me be the person who tells you:

1kygahu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1kygahu/tips_for_evangelizing/,Tips for Evangelizing,"Hello brothers and sisters in Christ, tomorrow is not promised we may not have an opportunity to save a soul. Here are a few tips:

**Know Your Strengths**

Are you good at public speaking? Maybe street preach with a microphone. Do you excel in interpersonal conversations? Go to a public space and spark conversations. Are you artistic? Perform gospel music live or upload them to the internet. Make pamphlets to handout. Are you well versed in the Bible and can teach it? make a bible study flyer to post throughout your town with verses from the Bible. Are you a healer? Offer prayers at a park.

**Walking Everywhere**

Need to go to the grocery store? Walk. Going to grab a coffee at a coffee shop. Walk. Going to a friends house nearby? Walk. We access more opportunities to engage with people when we walk as opposed to drive; you never know who you can come across that needs to hear the word of God. Women, maybe don’t do this alone. Everyone be cautious but don’t be afraid (Isaiah 41:10). I recommend morning to evening.

**Get Creative with Conversations**

Find ways to bring the conversation to the Gospel. It helps if you know scripture. The other day I was at the pier and approached a man who was fishing. I told him how one of my favorite figures in the Bible is Simon Peter because I resonate with him. I told the fisherman the part of the Gospel where Jesus told Peter and his brother to catch fish on the other side then Jesus told them they were going to fish for men.

It doesn’t have to be creative, you can be straightforward and say “hey, im going around spreading the good news, would you by any chance be interested in hearing it?” They say yes or no. If they say no, be respectful. As much as you know how important the news is, be confident that God’s will, will be done. So it’s best to leave with a “God bless you”. in my part of the world, no one says that. the idea is to bring the concepts together like ‘Good news’ and ‘God’. Let God do the rest.

**Clothing as a Tool**

Having clothing that says “Jesus loves you” or anything alike can help signal to people your bold faith. People are drawn by someone who is passionate and confident about what they believe. We believe the most important message ever so we should stand confident. 

In crowded areas where it’s impossible to reach-out to everyone, you might be giving your undivided attention to someone but at least the clothing can do some of the work to plant the seed. Even if it’s as small as a mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32). 

Yet there’s a strength to someone who’s doesn’t wear any christian clothing. There’s no agenda, just a human being who is passionate about their faith. This option is better in less crowded/dense areas or running errands when the main focus isn't to evangelize.

**Know your Audience**

Adults, probably stay away from kids if they’re alone. Stick to adults.

**Meet people where they’re at, no conversation is a waste. Read the room.**

You will find yourself introducing, re-introducing, or reminding people of the gospel. Meeting people where they’re at is asking questions to get an idea of where they are so you could be a vessel for God to work. 

People might describe bad experiences with christians, so don’t overlook it. It’s best to address it and maybe offer a way to expand their understanding of a christian. At its heart, being a follower of Christ is about Love. 

We are creatures that operate on an unconscious level too. Think about body posture. Jesus came to Jerusalem on a donkey, was eye level with the people (Luke 19:28-40). Sit or stand level to them.

Some people won’t be interested if they know it’s about Jesus. Respect their choice to not converse further. We are trying to open their perspective on christianity, not affirm their biases — planting the seed is the most important part. Dont underestimate the effect in being courages to speak to a stranger about your beliefs; there is power in leaving that impression. Someone can go to the best steakhouse in the world but if they’re force feeding the steak into your mouth, it won’t be a pleasant experience. Similarly, we don’t want to leave people with a bad encounter. It will just be more work for the next person or God to undo the damage. 

We won’t know the effect of our work in this lifetime. Someone else may reap the harvest of your seed just as much as you might reap the harvest of a lot of other peoples hard work. 

Some people you may meet will describe being locked-in with Jesus so this can be an opportunity to strengthen each others faith. Remember “he who is least among you all is the one who is great” (Luke 9:48). Through evangelizing you might embolden them to do it. But also, Jesus warns us that “the gate is narrow” some will say “Lord Lord I casted demons out in your name” (Matthew 7). We can learn if the person needs more guidance by listening and asking the right questions; you never know.

Some people will have heretical beliefs where they think Jesus is a version of a universal interpretation of god where multiple beliefs can be accepted. Respond by bringing the conversation to Jesus’ finished work on the cross. Jesus is the only way, truth, and the life. No one come's to the Father except through Him (John 14:6). 

Similarly, others will have other religious beliefs. It would be helpful to be a little acquainted to know how to navigate the conversation. Remember why Jesus represents the perfect, divine answer to our fallible existence. Remember (omniscient) God always planned to rescue us through His only begotten Son. Its not following a text that saves us, not our own limited capability of digging deep to perform works, its a living man who understands our struggles on earth who continues to oversee every aspect of our lives.

It's always nice to end conversations with 'Jesus loves you'.

**Be Personable and be you**

This isn’t a product you’re selling, it’s life you’re speaking; set your light on a lampstand (Luke 8:16). God made every detail of you to be unique, down to your personality; use it (Psalm 139). Be charismatic if you’re funny, tell a story if you’re a good story teller. Do you speak more than one language, go to a neighborhood where you can use both.

**Just do it, don’t get discouraged you’ll get better at it with time. Jesus did not leave us as orphans, we have guidance through The Holy Spirit (John 14:18). You will learn to be thoughtful, tactful, and discerning.** 

**Remember why you’re doing this**

We didn’t earn our salvation, it is through faith we want to do this (Ephesians 2:8-9). Our works are a manifestation of our faith (James 2:17). Our Father in heaven wants for none to perish but that all come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). In this way we love God with our heart and love our neighbor as ourself (Matthew 22:37-40). Go preach to all creation (Mark 16:15).

Some worked a little, most didn’t work at all, and a few actually made things worse.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/VFbam)

But then, I discovered **MITOLYN** — and everything changed.

# 🌿 Why I Tried MITOLYN

Like many others, I was dealing with **fatigue**, mental fog, poor digestion, and an overall lack of motivation. I wasn’t ""sick"" per se, but I certainly wasn’t thriving either. Coffee had stopped working, and no amount of diet changes or workouts helped for long.

I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** through a recommendation in a health forum. People were raving about it. Not influencers. **Real people**. That got my attention.

# 🔍 What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average multivitamin or caffeine-loaded pill. It’s a **mitochondrial support supplement**—designed to rejuvenate your cells, boost energy production, and restore biological balance at the **deepest cellular level**.

It uses advanced ingredients that work synergistically to support **mitochondrial health**, which is the **core power center** of every cell in your body. If your mitochondria are tired, **you’re tired.** MITOLYN fixes that.

# 🧪 The Ingredients: Science-Backed & Potent

I did my research before trying MITOLYN. I was blown away by the ingredient list. It's packed with:

* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** – a rare compound proven to stimulate new mitochondria growth.
* **CoQ10** – boosts energy and heart health.
* **NAD+ precursors** – essential for anti-aging and cellular repair.
* **Magnesium, Zinc, and other vital minerals** – for metabolic function and nervous system support.

These are not filler ingredients — these are the real deal. The dosage is optimal, the blend is synergistic, and it’s **100% natural and free from GMOs, soy, gluten, or artificial junk.**

# Week 3:

# Week 4:

By this point, I was absolutely convinced. I had **sustained energy**, better skin, better mood, and sharper memory. This wasn't a placebo — this was a genuine transformation.

But then, I discovered **MITOLYN** — and everything changed.

# 🌿 Why I Tried MITOLYN

Like many others, I was dealing with **fatigue**, mental fog, poor digestion, and an overall lack of motivation. I wasn’t ""sick"" per se, but I certainly wasn’t thriving either. Coffee had stopped working, and no amount of diet changes or workouts helped for long.

I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** through a recommendation in a health forum. People were raving about it. Not influencers. **Real people**. That got my attention.

# 🔍 What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average multivitamin or caffeine-loaded pill. It’s a **mitochondrial support supplement**—designed to rejuvenate your cells, boost energy production, and restore biological balance at the **deepest cellular level**.

It uses advanced ingredients that work synergistically to support **mitochondrial health**, which is the **core power center** of every cell in your body. If your mitochondria are tired, **you’re tired.** MITOLYN fixes that.

# 🧪 The Ingredients: Science-Backed & Potent

I did my research before trying MITOLYN. I was blown away by the ingredient list. It's packed with:

* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** – a rare compound proven to stimulate new mitochondria growth.
* **CoQ10** – boosts energy and heart health.
* **NAD+ precursors** – essential for anti-aging and cellular repair.
* **Magnesium, Zinc, and other vital minerals** – for metabolic function and nervous system support.

These are not filler ingredients — these are the real deal. The dosage is optimal, the blend is synergistic, and it’s **100% natural and free from GMOs, soy, gluten, or artificial junk.**

# Week 1:

Within **3–4 days**, I noticed I was waking up feeling **rested** — not groggy. This alone shocked me. I usually drag myself out of bed. I also felt a bit more focused throughout the day.

# Week 2:

I was sleeping deeper, my digestion improved noticeably, and my brain fog started to lift. Tasks that felt heavy were now easy. I was **more productive** without caffeine or sugar.

# Week 3:

I started going for walks again. My body felt **lighter**, more capable. My motivation came back. I also noticed I wasn’t getting my usual afternoon crashes. MITOLYN was now part of my daily routine.

# Week 4:

By this point, I was absolutely convinced. I had **sustained energy**, better skin, better mood, and sharper memory. This wasn't a placebo — this was a genuine transformation.

Today, I’m writing this detailed MITOLYN review not just as a satisfied customer—but as someone who finally feels in control of their life and health again.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/VFbam)

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

Also admittedly considered clamber for view from Dome as somewhat too touristy for this pretentious tourist. Anyway, during my recent trip a friend of mine asked if I had a coffee up there. That piqued my curiosity and few days later when i found myself in the Basilica again with some time to spare, off i went in search of ticket for the Dome. First I thought (following signs pointing to that lower entrance hall you go when visiting papal crypts) that i can buy ticket on one of desk here - in fact you need to go out into courtyard and look for a booth nearby. Being lazy so and so i bought ticket with ride in lift and soon stepped out on roof of the Basilica. This was first surprise. Dont know why exactly I supposed that lift will deliver us up to Dome itself, but walking on the roof was perhaps the most interesting, and informative, experience of this visit. You already know that Basilica is immense building, Renaissance declaration of intent in marble writ large. But up there you finally comprehend that it is in fact something between large village or small town all by itself (and I speak about Basilica itself here, not Vatican state as such). Then you go into Dome. To be perfectly honest: being lazy so and so with not exactly good head for highs it was just enough to walk round that walkway round the base of dome (just above Tu es Petrus inscription in mosaic), looking more on mosaic around me that down into Basilica and out on the roof again. Further climb on stairs inside Dome  tu outer platform under Lantern i left to more athletic visitors. I went for that coffee. Because yes, there is both gift shop and a small bar. So i bought myself an *americano* and looked at that unusual view at the back of Apostles standing on the top of Basilica facade, you also see roof of Paul VI Audience Hall on one side and so on.

1kyg4zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kyg4zd/abyssal_829/,Abyssal 829,"“829, you copy?” The voice crackled through the speakers on the console in front of me, pulling me back from the drowsy lethargy that I’d been enjoying for the last hour. I reluctantly sat up in my chair and dropped my feet from where they’d been resting atop the workstation to the dirty metallic floor with a hollow thud. It’d been a long night; I hadn’t slept very well, and when my alarm woke me this morning, I felt as if I hadn’t slept at all.

That damned wind. It seemed like it never stopped, but last night had been exceptionally noisome after night fell, howling and whistling across the exterior of the station, like it was searching for a way in. If I used my imagination just a little, it almost sounded like a hundred fingernails scratching at the hatch.

I tried not to use my imagination too much.

It wasn’t much better this morning. It sounded like a hell of a blow out there, but that was to be expected this time of year, I suppose.

“Abyssal 829, this is Central – respond. *Crawford, pick up if you’re there*,” the voice hailed again, this time with the distinct coloring of urgency. It was slightly distorted, sounding strangely artificial mixed in with all that static.

I took a sip of my lukewarm coffee with a grimace and switched on the microphone.

“Yeah, this is Crawford. That you, Wilks?” I asked, as if it could have been anyone else out here in this frozen wasteland.

When Wilks replied, I heard the unmistakable tinge of relief in his tone. “Jesus, Mike, I’ve been hailing you for ten minutes. Where the hell have you been?”

*Ten minutes? I hadn’t heard a thing*. Maybe I’d dozed off after all, I thought, resolving to lay off the whiskey for a while.

“Yeah, sorry, Jack – I was in the head,” I lied. “What’s up?”

“515 went offline this morning at around 05:40,” he said. “Last transmission was at their oh-two-hundred scheduled check-in. Nothing since then. They’ve missed two check-ins since then.”

Now I sat up straight in my chair, the last vestiges of sleepiness dissolving in an instant. I punched a few keys on the console, bringing up my OpStat displays. “*Offline?* Are you sure? Storm’s pretty bad out here on the south rim; I’m getting a lot of distortion from your end. Maybe there’s just too much interference.”

Jack Wilks paused a moment before speaking again. “Corporate radioed me a little while ago. Their telemetry for 515 was reading some low-level seismic activity for forty-three minutes before all feeds went dead. Last status update from the station officer was, and I quote, ‘confused and agitated’.”

“Geller? She’s as strait-laced as they come,” I said with a frown. “I’ve never heard anybody describe her as confused *or* agitated.”

“I know,” Wilks said. “That’s what worries me. Especially with what happened last month.”

He didn’t need to elaborate; the memory of what happened to Abyssal 524 was still fresh in all our minds.

“That was an anomaly,” I said, echoing the official corporate findings. “Geological surveys were rushed and incomplete when 524 was deployed.” I tried to sound as resolute as I could, but Jack knew me better than that. It was more for my benefit than his.

“I know,” he relented, though I knew he didn’t believe it any more than I did. “But still, it makes me uneasy. Geller’s tough – as tough as they come. Hell, she’s been on station for what, sixteen months, all by herself?”

“Something like that, yeah,” I replied. My fingers danced across the keyboard, navigating the status screens until I found the one I was looking for – a listing of all the rim monitoring stations. My eyes scanned the list of amber text as I paged through the screens. I stopped when I found it – Abyssal 515. It stood out on the page like a beacon. Unlike the other station listings on the screen, the status metrics for 515 were empty, just dashes where the abbreviations and numeric values should have been.

“*Shit,*” I said under my breath, my mind already sifting through possible explanations that *weren’t* worst-case.

I didn’t come up with too many of them.

“So, what’s the plan?” I asked, though I had a sick feeling in my gut that I already knew what it was.

“We need to check it out and see if Geller’s okay,” he said carefully. “It might just be a communication disruption, like you said, but we need to make sure.”

I knew where this was heading, and I was already shaking my head. “No way, Jack. Uh-uh. There’s no way I’m going out there in this weather. One good gust will blow the mule right over the edge and I’m not getting paid enough for that. Rescue operations are not part of my contracted responsibilities.”

“Mike, listen – it’s not about the company or the monitoring station. If Geller’s hurt, we can’t just leave her out there. She could need help.”

“So, send someone else,” I argued. “Hell, send a response team or check it out yourself – I don’t care. I’m a monitoring tech, not a rescue operator.”

Wilks paused a moment before he spoke again. “The nearest response team has already been mobilized, but they’re hours away. I’m even farther, you know that. Mike, I can’t compel you to go check it out, but if Geller’s hurt or in need of help, you might be the only chance she has. What if it was you out there?”

I pushed myself away from the console and stood, running a hand through my scruffy hair and pacing anxiously, thoughts spinning. Wilks had fallen silent – he knew that there was nothing else he could say to convince me, but he also knew he’d already set the hook. If something *had* happened to the monitoring station, it was likely already too late for Geller. But if she *was* still there, she would need help, and soon. If nothing else, she would need an evac, and 829 – *my* shack – was the nearest option. I wondered how long a person could last outside in this weather, especially if they didn’t have shelter.

I heard Wilks’ words again in my head and I wondered what it would feel like if it were me.

Alone, in the dark. Huddling in the cold and the wind.

Listening to those sounds all around me. Maybe seeing dim shadows in the blinding mist.

 Just waiting for someone – *anyone* – to come for me.

*Damn it.*

“You’re an asshole, Jack,” I said finally.

“I know, Mike. I’m sorry,” was all he said.

“I’ll contact you when I have something to report.”

“Thanks, Mike. I’ll be standing by. Central out.”

\*

Fifteen minutes later, I was bundled in my foul weather gear – heavy coat and pants striped with reflective material, with thick gloves and boots. A pair of weather-worn goggles hung around my neck as I buckled myself into the enclosed cabin of my mule. The thing looked like one of those industrial snow cats, with rusted caterpillar tracks and a rotating emergency beacon on the roof. The yellow paint was faded and chipped, and the windscreen was scratched and in desperate need of replacement. Only one of the wipers still remained, and it barely worked well enough to leave grimy streaks across the glass.

I could hear the raging wind thrashing against the exterior of the heavy steel roll-up door, but it sounded subdued, removed from where I sat. The garage was large enough to accommodate two mules parked abreast, with room to spare, but it felt claustrophobic inside the cab.

“*What the hell are you doing, Mike*?” I asked myself for probably the hundredth time as I pressed the ignition switch. The powerful engine lurched to life with an angry roar, reverberating against the cold steel of the walls. The vibrations shook the gear shifter with a rattle as I worked my way across the illuminated control panel, turning on the various systems. Interior heat, air filters, comms, exterior lighting, navigation – I activated each of the subsystems in turn, verifying their statuses on the main display. When I was satisfied that all was working as expected, I took a deep breath and keyed in the command to raise the heavy roll-up door.

A red strobe near the door began to flash, joined by a muted warning alarm, and then the door lurched into motion, rising from the concrete floor with a squeal of protest. The gray light of day washed in as it rose, and I felt the raging of the wind as it swirled into the garage area, buffeting the mule as it came.

I lifted the headset from its hook and placed it over my ears, adjusting the boom mic in front of my mouth.

“Central, this is Abyssal 829 for radio check, how copy?” I said.

Wilks replied immediately. “829, this is Central. Read you five-by-five.”

“I’m heading out now, Jack. I’ll stay in contact and I’ll advise as soon as I have anything.”

And with that, I engaged the gear lever and throttled up, easing the mule forward, out of the shelter of the station and into the fury of the storm.

The monitoring stations were all connected by a paved roadway marked with bright yellow strobe lights to guide our way. The low, dense cloud cover overhead and the chaotic winds did their best to make it damned near impossible to see more than twenty feet, and that was only because of the efforts of the high-intensity exterior lights of the mule.

Within a minute, I glanced over my shoulder to find that my station had been swallowed up by the dim light and charcoal-colored dust. The muted white exterior lights were only just barely visible and fading quickly as I went.

All around me on either side of the road, the terrain was rocky and uneven – foreign, almost alien. Though it was barely past noon, the daylight was so subdued that it might as well have been late dusk. I pushed along, watching the rock formations pass by on either side. They seemed closer, somehow, as if the road had narrowed, dragging the terrain with it as it collapsed inward.

How long had it been since I’d been out here? A month, at least. Probably closer to two. That had been late summer, though, and the storms hadn’t really started yet.

On my right, what seemed like an endless hellscape of jagged rocky outcroppings and uneven, upturned ground stretched out beyond sight.

But it was to my left that I kept my eyes strained and focused. *It* was there; close but still hidden by the dust and the wind. That made it all the more unsettling, I thought – not being able to see it, but knowing it was there.

I straightened my course, having unconsciously drifted to the right side of the roadway, as if my hands were trying to keep me as far away as possible.

The wind rocked the mule on its tracks and strained at the doors, trying to pry them open to get inside. At one point, I thought I felt the steel treads scrape and slide across the gritty pavement as the heavy vehicle fought against a sudden gust, but that was probably just my imagination.

As unnerving as it was being away from the station in the storm, my rational mind knew there wasn’t really any chance of being blown over. The winds were strong, to be sure, and I wouldn’t want to be walking around outside, but the mule was twelve thousand pounds – six tons of anchor – with a massively overpowered engine driving the tracks. Outside was hell, but I was safe enough in here.

From the storm, at least.

I had traveled a mile, perhaps two, when I reached a spot where a sheer vertical wall of rockface rose a hundred feet in the air to the right of the roadway. It served as a windbreak, providing a temporary respite from the worst of the gale.

It also allowed the first view of the rim, only fifty feet away. I throttled back, bringing the mule to a halt in the shelter of the cliffside, and my eyes swept out over the vast empty space we knew simply as *the pit*.

It was twenty miles across, a ragged circular shaft punched into the solid rock of the ground. The walls of the pit were brutal and abrupt, as if the thing had been formed by some unimaginably massive bore.

We had no idea how deep it was, or if it even had a bottom, despite how insane that may sound. Nothing sent down into those depths ever returned. Manned vehicles, remote drones, even tethered cameras and sensors – they all just vanished without a trace, without warning. Even radar pulses and laser measuring devices were left blind by that immense black void.

No idea how it had come to be, or why. There was so much we didn’t know about it.

All we knew for sure was that thirty-seven years ago, in the middle of an active winter storm season, the lonely weather outpost that had been operating out here in this wasteland had gone silent. No alerts, no distress calls.

Nothing.

A month later, when the weather subsided enough to allow teams to investigate what had happened, all they found was the pit, a stygian maw larger than anyone could have imagined.

A doorway to hell, maybe.

Monitoring stations were built around its rim, to observe and document anything they could. Still, we knew little more about it now than we did all those years ago.

And everything we did know was bad.

I tore my eyes away from the swirling clouds of dust and mist that seemed ever-present as they rolled over the edges of the rim, hiding whatever lay below.

With a quiet curse, I put the mule back in gear and continued my travel. I was close to 515 now – not more than a few hundred yards, I estimated. The navigation screen jumped and changed, sometimes showing me right on top of the station, and at other times miles away yet. It might have been disconcerting if not for the fact that this was yet another of the occasional anomalies that surrounded the pit – the effect it had on radio and electromagnetic signals.

That’s one of the reasons I hadn’t been too concerned about radio communication loss with 515 initially. It wasn’t uncommon and typically remedied itself within an hour or two.

Telemetry loss was something different, though.

Telemetry from each of the monitoring stations was transmitted in real time via fiber optic cables carefully buried beside the roadway in a massive ring around the pit. They weren’t as easily disrupted by whatever was going on in there. If the company had lost the telemetry stream, that implied something bad had happened.

I pushed the thoughts from my head as I drove the mule along, focusing on the roadway ahead and already feeling the beginnings of a tension headache working at the back of my skull.

Soon, I came to the offshoot of pavement that veered left of the roadway and served as the approach to Abyssal 515. I released the breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding as the mule pushed stubbornly through the dust and damp mist. The wind had dropped significantly for the moment, and the air was almost still now.

That happened sometimes during these storms – the calm could last a minute or even an hour before the winds returned suddenly and without warning. God help the person caught in the open when that happened.

I was so focused on trying to pierce the veil of grimy fog that I almost didn’t notice that the paved drive ahead of me suddenly dropped away into the gaping abyss of the pit. I slammed both feet on the brake and the heavy vehicle rocked to a sudden halt, throwing me against the safety harness painfully.

I could almost imagine the ground beneath the mule’s treads beginning to give way.

“*Shit shit shit*,” I cursed, throwing the gearbox into reverse and carefully backing away from the edge. I’d come within feet of driving right over the rim and into whatever terrible oblivion lay below. Even with their grip on the controls, my hands were shaking as adrenalin flooded my senses and narrowed my vision.

When I’d backed away to a safe distance, I set the brake and took the mule out of gear, willing my hammering heartrate to slow and hoarse breathing to calm. I felt lightheaded, but that soon passed.

I repositioned the microphone in front of my lips. “Central, this is Abyssal 829. How copy?”

Nothing but static answered my hail. The suffocating feeling of remoteness and solitude crowded my thoughts, and I pushed them away as best I could.

I tried hailing Jack again with no better luck. The damned storm was blocking me. Isolating me from everything else.

I knew I needed to investigate further. I’d come this far, after all. I couldn’t leave without at least confirming my fears.

I waited a few seconds for the feeling of panic to subside, and I was able to unbuckle my harness. I removed the radio headset and positioned the goggles over my eyes to protect them from the scouring effect of the windblown dust and grit. We’d learned from those who came here before us; we knew it could blind a man in seconds.

Raising the filtered gaiter to cover the rest of my face, I unlatched and pushed the door of the mule open, stepping out onto the exposed steel tracks and then carefully climbing down to the rock-strewn ground.

The air out here was frigid – colder than it should have been, but my gear protected me. Even so, the icy air found even the most miniscule of gaps in my clothing and penetrated to my bare skin beneath, drawing from me a shudder and raising gooseflesh across my body.

I hated it out here.

Arming myself with a high-intensity torch from the cab of the mule, I carefully made my way across the paved drive, keeping the brilliant white beam scanning the gray and black terrain ahead of me.

Strange sounds surrounded the pit – it was one of the things I found the most unsettling about being out here. Deep and almost ethereal, like the whale-song of some displaced and cosmic leviathan, it rolled through the air, vibrating the ground beneath my boots. It wasn’t loud enough to be uncomfortable, but there was no denying the psychological effect it had on a person out here all alone.

Most deployments out here were only two-month stints; that’s about what the average person could handle before they started having…*issues*. Some others, like me, were able to stay longer. I’d been here for eight months so far and wasn’t planning to rotate out for another thirty-eight days.

Macy Geller was different, though. With four years in the marines and more than sixteen months on-station here, she was a goddamned legend. I had no idea how she’d persisted for so long, but I knew one thing for sure – Macy Geller was going to retire a very young and very rich woman.

At least, that was my sincere hope.

I made my way cautiously along the edge of the rim, making sure to keep as safe a distance as my search would allow. The rock that abutted the edge hadn’t crumbled away or eroded – the terminus was smooth and knife-sharp where it dropped away.

Pushing on a bit farther, I came upon what I had been dreading since I arrived – the steel and concrete foundation of the monitoring station itself. Of the building, there was no sign – it was simply gone, replaced by that menacing and unending nothingness that it had bordered. The foundation was twisted and torn, as if it had been riven by some great claw. Bundles of sheared wires hung exposed and swaying over the edge, and the fine white hair of fiber optic cables lay snaked out from their junction box nearby.

“*Holy shit*,” I muttered, staggering back a few steps from the devastation. What had happened to 515? What could have done this?

I was finished here. I needed to get back to the mule and back to my station. I needed to report what I’d found. Maybe I’d even request an early extraction. I’d done my time – let them find someone else to keep watch over this fucking hole.

As I turned, my boot found an unseen rut that cut across the rocky ground and I nearly fell before catching myself. I realized that I was looking at the distinct tracks made by another mule, leading away from where the station had stood.

Maybe she’d managed to get away, after all…

“*Macy! Macy Geller!*” I shouted as loud as I could, swinging my flashlight beam across the whole area. Once again, the lack of visibility was frustrating, making my search a nearly impossible task. She couldn’t have gone far, especially in the direction the tracks led. There was nothing but broken and rocky terrain that way, with boulders the size of houses crowding the landscape.

“*Geller! It’s Mike Crawford from 829! If you can hear me, call out!*” I shouted, my voice sounding pitifully small out here.

When I found Geller’s mule, it emerged from the mist like a wounded animal, its nose driven disastrously into the sheer edge of a rocky shelf twenty feet high. Even from here, I could tell it probably wouldn’t ever move again from where it now rested.

I rushed to the cab, painfully aware that the wind was starting to pick back up again. I was just thankful that it was giving me some uncharacteristic warning instead of simply springing up and blowing me over the rim and into the pit.

The blunt nose of the mule had taken the worst of the impact, and even though it hadn’t been moving with any great speed when it found the rockface, twelve thousand pounds of steel in motion wasn’t inclined to stop on a dime.

I twisted the handle and pulled on the hatch, but the twisted and bent frame held it fast. I could see a form inside, in the driver’s seat, but the glass had been frosted over by the windblown grit and was nearly opaque, so I couldn’t make out any details. I didn’t miss the lack of movement, though.

Still, there was a chance now.

With renewed urgency, I rushed around to the rear of the mule, to where I knew the equipment storage was. Inside the weather-beaten compartment, I found the wrecking bar I was looking for – a heavy pry-bar with a pointed tip on one end and a thick flattened wedge on the other.

I came back around to the hatch and slammed the wedge into the gap between the door and the frame. The bar found purchase and I heaved against it with all my weight.

The metal groaned and fought, but then the door released with a screech and burst open so abruptly that I nearly fell on my ass.

I dropped the heavy bar to the ground with a ringing clatter and scrambled up onto the steel tracks of the mule, leaning into the cab. The nightmare I found there caused me to lurch backward, almost off the edge of the tracks.

Geller, the woman I’d known mostly through radio contact and whom I’d only met face-to-face on a few occasions, was still harnessed into her seat. Her heavy jacket had been thrown on in a hurry and wasn’t even zipped. Her goggles still sat securely over her eyes, but everything beyond that was a mess.

It took me longer than it should have to process exactly what I was seeing, and when I did, I still couldn’t make sense of it.

Drying, sticky blood covered everything in a tacky coating. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream that spoke of the terror that must have filled her final moments. Her skin was gray and splotchy, with what looked like open sores all over, weeping thick fluid and giving her the obscene appearance that the flesh was melting away from her skull.

I looked away from her face and saw her hands still wrapped around the controls, even in death. For a moment I wondered why they hadn’t released their grip. When I looked closer, I saw that they weren’t really *clutching* the hard plastic at all, but had somehow become adhered to it, sinking obscenely into the surface and… melding with it.

The veins of her exposed skin stood out in stark contrast, snaking just below the surface like black tendrils, spiderwebbing beneath her thin gray flesh. I forced myself to reach for her goggles and found them fused to her face. Looking through the scratched lenses instead, I found myself staring at two milky-white orbs, wide and filled with horror, but thankfully still and lifeless.

I’m not sure what I would have done if they’d blinked just then.

A sudden howl of wind rose as it wound through the rock and over the rim of the pit behind me. That was enough to draw my attention and spur me to motion.

I had to leave, and *now*. I couldn’t be caught outside my mule when the storm returned in earnest, or I might be blown right over the edge – just another soul lost to the darkness.

I’m still not sure why the storm had paused its fury long enough for me to complete my search; perhaps it *wanted* me to find Geller, to show me what it had done to her.

Maybe it wanted to show me what it was going to do to me.

I raced back to the safety of my mule, the engine still idling as I’d left it. Hurriedly securing myself in the cab, I turned it around and rushed back to my station, pushing the throttles farther than I should have. The aging engine protested and the black roadway passed beneath me in a blur as I returned to the only haven I knew – Abyssal 829.

Miraculously, fifteen minutes later, the dim exterior lights of my station appeared before me, emerging from the wind-driven detritus of grimy and damp grit like a lighthouse of old. I slowed as it came fully into view and keyed the exterior door of the garage as soon as I was close enough.

The hellish storm had returned with all its fury now, and I could even see the muted flashes of distant lightning from somewhere over the pit.

That was new.

As soon as I had the mule inside and the door closed securely behind it, I quickly shut it down and leapt from the cab, rushing into the station and to my control room. I shed off the heavy jacket, letting it fall to the floor as I reached for the communication controls. I had to let Jack know what I’d seen – what had happened to Geller.

He’d know what to do; that was his job, after all. This was all above my pay grade.

But then my hand froze, hovering over the console as my eyes settled on the OpStat screen I’d been looking at before I left.

The list of monitoring stations was still waiting patiently for my return, but something was wrong. I felt my mouth go dry as I saw their telemetry feeds begin to go offline, one by one, blinking out like candles being snuffed.

Outside, the wind howled, and I heard that haunting moan sweep over the station, louder than ever before – maybe closer – and now sounding less like the ethereal whale song I’d always equated it to.

Now it sounded more menacing. Threatening.

I went to the GP because for years I have been suspecting I have enditrometriosis and after so many visits and begging to actually get it checked by a gynecologist, I am finally getting an appointment with one, because as you may suspect, I have been in a pretty horrible condition for days now (years) that's finally being taken serious by my GP (a new one!) after I had fainted in my commute yesterday to home from my internship. after I got home to tell what would happen in said appointment my mother started to make really weird remarks about the echo (? if that's what it's called in English) which I had to lie and say would not be vaginal, because God forbid I'd lose my virginity that way. she then started to go off this whole rampage and trash me, saying how I should just live alone if I am so devout to my boyfriend, just because I didn't want to move an appointment I had made with him this Friday to join him while he goes for an important job application, for an appointment that'd just be a short coffee date over playing some piano in church (in September.. so plenty of time for such an appointment, plus time next week). 

yes, from one point to another, since I am still not sure why'd she bring that up after our talk about the GP, but I think it (the word gynecologist) was a trigger for her to go on a rampage. as you can expect, she started bringing up more things, trashing me more, as well as my partner, for some reason, which I couldn't take anymore when she started comparing him and my future to my dad and her relationship with my dad (not a good man). I just stood still and said I'd head out, after taking my bus card, because her words hit me too hard (that man's also died two years ago, so it hits me aefully hatd) and I didn't want to deal with her anymore. pretty chilfish for my age, but usually she kicks me out by throwing stuff at me, so I thought after she expressed how much she didn't want me at home with her, i might as well just leave. 

I wasn't planning on going anywhere however, because I know my sister and her end up looking for me and ""apologizing"" their way into getting me home again. apologizing being mr having to say sorry and forget what happened, because arguments are normal. I decided to text my boyfriend however if he had any time and was in the city he lives in, and he asked if I wanted to see him and offered me to be at his place for a bit, to which I just said: ""I just don't want to be home right now, nor alone."" so he said he'd come to the train station at his city for me. I went to his place, make-upless and everything, looking like a mess and felt pretty humiliated and ugly and mannerless because I'm one to take effort and usually visit people with a small gift of appreciation, but I was welcomed well and was given food. I asked my boyfriend if he could text my sister that I was with him, in case they'd be worried. after he did so, here's where I feel like an AH. 

frist, imposing in his house. my sister texted him how weird it was I barged into his house and didn't stay home, as if I don't have a room and anything, and texted it was shameful and I'm shameless for even leaving like that and bringing a bad name to my family. I feel like they're right and I should've just stayed outside, on my own. second, I feel like with my actions I unnecessarily brought my bf into something he shouldn't have to deal with. trashing me in front of him is okay, but I feel really guilty my family went off on him that way, and with my mom already saying all that stuff about him, I feel like I've just made things worse. I've tried to appease it immediately and my bf says I'm not in the wrong and it's normal to ask for some company if you feel down, but I feel horrid. they texted they went looking for me and everything, which makes me feel more awful, because while I did wait an hour at the bus stop (where they'd search for me first, due to them kicking me out often), I still think I've made things worse for everyone. I just want a neutral judgement on this, since I feel like my bf just would feel too guilty to be honest to me, and I'm not really seeing eye to eye with my family to deem their word objective. it just hits me hard because I feel really humiliated and I'm not really in the best state nor looking like the best state to think well of me (even with my bf insisting I look naturally pretty and he's visited me often without a gift as well in better situations). 

also, before anyone tells me to move out or says I'm an adult. as you can tell from their bigotry about the echo, the only way out for me is marriage or disownment and I just really don't want to lose my only ever family right now until I'm finally settled well, since I just need my diploma after finishing this internship to get a good job, enough to find proper housing and everything. 

so, AITA for the way I've handled all this? please be honest.

1kyg1s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaddadclub/comments/1kyg1s1/dads_body_found_by_sheriff/,Dads body found by Sheriff," I am a 27 y/o man with an alcoholic father who was not present most of my life. I got a call on May 15th from my father’s sister. She told me that my father had passed away and that she didn’t have a ton of info as she was only the emergency contact and not the next of kin. That night I had to tell my mom and younger brother. The next day I received a call from the coroner of the county to give me information. They told me he had been there for 6-8 weeks in his apt since he died, and was found by a maintenance man posting his second late rent notice. I authorized an autopsy and started making arrangements to travel to that county to sign for his belongings and begin cleaning out his apartment. Cleaning out the apartment was the most traumatic thing I have ever done, he had just moved in to this apartment and didn’t even unpack anything. The entire apartment looked like wild dogs had been living there using the whole place as a toilet and ordering ipa six packs on DoorDash. Apparently it is known as coffee ground emesis and is a symptom of end stage alcoholism. He didn’t ever reach out for help from anyone. He was going through tons of Valium from a dark web source and the spot where he was found in his apartment has basically been dissolved from where he laid on it.

I don’t know how I am going to go forward, I keep having nightmares and not eating. I have to be back at work and I can barely function or take care of myself.

The last time I saw my dad was the first time in over a year and a half and he was not doing well. I can’t stop blaming myself for not intervening and forcing him to go to treatment or something. The fact he never reached out to ask for help or anything is so disheartening. 

Please help.

Edit: we are currently planning his memorial and trying to find out how to proceed with removing his totality of belongings from his apartment with assistance from a biohazard specialist. The problem is it’s so far away and I don’t trust people who I can’t meet first.

He also has a storage unit that is extremely far away. This has affected every aspect of my life negatively and it has been really hard to find support anywhere which is why I’m posting here.",1,1748538077.0,deaddadclub,1,1.0,False

1kyfza5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1kyfza5/wanderlust_part_4/,Wanderlust Part 4(?),"May 28th, Day 12(?) of Wanderlust

Got a train from Belgium into Lille, France. It's quite a big city, thought I may have passed through there before but I had not. Large plazas, many theatres and churches, numerous bars, cafes, restaurants and takeaways of numerous cuisines, healthy city buildings. 

Lots of students about, a not-tiny number of beggars and a medium amount of tourists.

The typical problem when travelling, or going for a night out and walking into a bar or cafe is talking to people. They are strangers to you and you are doubly if not more so of a stranger to them if you have just walked in when everyone is relaxed with each other.   

Especially if you seem different - because of your appearance, clothing, accessories (backpack) or all three. Add in the language barrier and the problem's difficulty increases.

It's not all bad though, being a native English speaker can be a gift in such situations, especially when people pick up on your fragmented attempt at their language, and often the barman or another bar lizard (such as myself) would ask what country I am from, or what language I speak.

Replying English often gets people talking, asking more questions, and the ice is broken. 

Though in my experience it is sadly rare that such conversations go much deeper than that, and it is tiring repeating the same answers to the same questions after literally thousands of times.

As I arrived quite late I wandered the city at night, calling in a few bars for soft drinks and small beers, not cheap but not many alternatives except food on a night in most places when constrained by (hawks phlegm) currency.

I found a secluded spot near a theatre and laid down my blanket and sleeping bag and settled down to sleep.

As I was nodding off after an hour it started to rain. Lying there, as the first drops start to get a little heavier.

As you are weighing up of it will stop or stay at this amount, the dread builds as you increasingly know you are going to have to get out of bed, repack everything and find somewhere else, and I'd you don't do it quickly your things will get soaked.

Making my decision, I hurriedly packed my things having done so for years, and moved on from the theatre as the rain got heavier.

I was in luck, for round the corner of the same unused theatre building there was some steps leading to an alcove entrance, and even better luck, some other person had laid down clean cardboard as a mattress.

I unpacked again and tried to get some sleep but it wouldn't come, despite being tired and having walked for many a mile and being awake for many an hour that day.

 I decided whole having difficulty sleeping to open a can of strong lager, gifted to me by a guy in  a park in Belgium, watching the almost silent and still plaza save for traffic lights, and the occasional shout of a person from a window or a passing couple passing through laughing together.

The city has a voice once you have travelled long enough to pick up on it. It speaks of it's denizens concerns, wants and needs, desires and fears. 

It sounds ludicrous, but you can tap into this thought stream and with your own thoughts responding to the city with answers rather than questions, things become...more pronounced in an uncertain sense. I mean sense as in six senses.

Writing this it reminded me of the time I first played Disco Elysium, years ago, yet after I had started wandering with my possessions on my back as a hobo. 

Details such as people collecting plastic and glass rubbish dropped or binned by others to be exchanged for a few euros in small shops, and wanting seriously to climb into a dumpster to sleep for the night, rather than spend 30 euros on a bed and a bathroom for the night when you can sleep freely anywhere(hmmm), while chemicals to consume are much harder to get without money.

There is a skill in this game called Shivers and as someone who has been labelled psychotic by therapists the voices that guide the main character resonated.

Even the city name, Martinaise caused a bump in the solipsism area of potential philosophy.

I woke fairly dry, tried to get back to sleep before the sun rose higher, managed another half hour or so before realising it wasn't going to happen that morning.

I packed up again (leaving the cardboard for another) and as I picked upy backpack, I noticed that the can of strong lager I had carefully placed beside me (nearly full) had gone. 

Either the wind grew strong enough to knockover a full size can of lager over some steps and I didn't hear or feel it, or concerning of a different type someone had stealthily climbed the steps, and taken the can of beer.

Maybe a Goddess of Hobos sent an angel to make sure my liver doesn't get beaten up touch by the liquids I give to it.

I walked round the city and did the typical tourist thing of looking for the sights.

I appreciate city design and architecture as a layman, and walked around and on some churches, followed the paths of cobbles rather than of tarmac, and sat in a park or three.

After drinking a few cans of Heineken on a park, feeding pigeons on a shared baguette and admiring the mother of all jelly babies, I decided to move on from Lille.

Being a enjoyer of the sport of pinball, I had read that a pinball arcade in a small town a few.mipes from Lille's had several machines, a few that came out this year that I had heard good things about.

Still semi drunk and sleep-deprived and being without.cammabis since the theft, I managed to get the wrong direction on the metro, o ly realising after the speaker said to get off the train.

After taking the correct number of stops back the other way, I then had to walk to get a bus to where Google maps said I had to travel to.

Limited to free WiFi or hotspots of people and little charge ony phone (going to a bar or cafe just to charge a phone is a common experience, albeit a preferred one [i]sometimes[/i] to sleeping in a library recharging with one's phone), I had to ask the bus driver for directions while he didn't speak English, knowing only the name of the street. 

After seeing my open can of lager in my hand he said I can't drink that on the bus. We gave a sort of Fight Club nod to each other and then I loved the conversation to directions to the Rue d'Industrie.

The stop was at the far end of the circular, and the bus driver's 17 minutes break was to be had, as he told me I could smoke here a whole and I said it should be a longer break.

I went outside for fresh air and a cigarette in a tiny village with no name. I noticed the bus driver using a key fob to enter a toilet.

I marvelled at the fear of crime or more likely the fear of having to spend money on replacing toilet rolls and whatever else that would make a group of people install a key fob lock to prevent public access to a toilet, the only one for miles around (as is typical for a village).

I psychically cursed the bloated figure of Capitalism had taken a stranglehold over so much of the world and poisoned the.monds of mankind, before getting back on the bus.

Dropped near an industrial estate and with no GPS, I asked at a nearby boulangerie on the estate directions to the train station, as I knew that the gaming arcade was not far from one of the two train stations. 

The young girl cleaning the floors, embarrassed at the difficulty she found in talking English to a stranger, stammeringly gavee the directions, pausing to check the word she was using is correct from French to English.

Feeling warm and fuzzy agreeing that ""going straight"" means forward in English (at least on directions) watching her blush, I thanked her gratefully and truly for her excellent directions.

She beamed behind her glasses and I set off from the industrial estate into the town centre.

The skies were grey and it was starting to rain as I shouldered my pack near the exit to the motorway. A sign said town centre this way in white along the side of the motorway, and another sign said central train station in another direction. 

I decided to try my luck hitching at the slip junction near some traffic lights, with the double benefit low speed cars and traffic lights for ample time to jump into a car.

As the cars began to slowly pass, I was holding out my thumb and mentally thinking ""Seglin"" with each glance at the car's occupants.

I began to hear ""intrusive"" thoughts as I did. Sometimes words ""solo"" and ""single"" sometimes whole sentences ""maybe he would rob me"".

I thought back ""also single"" to cars with single occupants, smiling as I made eye contact, and hoped for the best. People gave the occasional hand gesture, a truck driver gave a sympathetic good luck gesture (truckers tend to do that more than car drivers for some reason or other) but it was overall mostly negative. Deciding that the arcade opened at six and closed at twelve I may as well get walking.

With my hands in my backpack straps after a few minutes on an A road, a older man, bald with headphones looked at me like I was stupid and waved his thumb sideways cocking his eyes at me. I felt anger but kept calm glancing into his eyes holding tightly as I passed. 

After 20 minutes perhaps I got into town, correctly past the pharmacy and under a tunnel to the train station. Comparing my map to Google maps, the town signs label two different train stations while Google only lists one.

For some reason my GPS has reconnected and I had been walking in the wrong direction from the arcade.

A wave of anger and sadness made worse by fatigue, my character took mental damage and depressive attack took its toll. Shaking in angry sadness there was nothing sensible but to walk back the same way I had just walked.

Eventually getting back to where I started at the boulangerie, the arcade was two minutes away on  a road on the same estate.

A comical cry-laugh involuntarily issued from my throat and with aching feet and low character, I entered the large brightly lit arcade.

I entered the arcade and browsed the machines. A whole wall of pinball tables, with darts, table football and a couple of Mario Kart cabinets, some classic arcade cabs and two motorcycle games. 

As big as a factory floor with a large seating area and comfortable seating. I ordered a beer and 10 tokens for 10 euros then walked straight to the pinball tables.

Still fatigued, I played until closing and was impressed with the newer tables, particularly The Evil Dead, King Kong, Elvira, Dungeons and Dragons, and some others like Venom and Metallica Remastered.

Didn't get anywhere near my PB's (personal bests) or even the top ten for the arcade for the season, but I had fun.

After it closed I walked through the drizzling night back to town, and set up my sleeping area outside the entrance to the train station.

I slept quite well, and was woken by the sound of trainers scuffling to a stop near my head. I peeked out of my jacket/blindfold/scarf at two teenagers in hoodies looking down at me. 

My initial response, I admit, was a wave of adrenaline and fear. One of the lads put their hand down towards me and gently pressed a Euro into my hand. I politely refused and thanked him. He shrugged and walked off with his friend.

A while later I was woken once more, this time by an elderly smiling lady, talking French that I didn't quite catch but offered a carrier bag of petit dejeuner - two jam sandwiches, an apple and a banana, some snickers bars, and a can of orange juice and a quarter of black coffee in a half litre bottle, still warm.

Gratefully accepting I thanked her briefly holding her extended hand. She patted me on my hand then walked across the street and entered her house.

Small town hospitality still exists!

As I was packing my things a train started to pull into the station and I knew I wouldn't make it,  so packed my things and checked the train times. The train that had just arrived and then the next in about two hours.

The train set off and I walked towards the bus stop. 
Another train started to pull in as I left, and I ran back for it but was too slow to make it through the tunnel onto the opposite platform.

C'est la vie, I walked into town to the bus station. A bus arrived after a few minutes to Lille and I got on. I was told the bus didn't accept bank cards and the price was 1 euro, I have none on me. I sigh and head back into town.

I entered a cafe and asked the owner if I could buy a coffee for 2.50 and charge me 5, and go e me 2.50 on coins. He agreed, I thanked him and sat outside leisurely soaking up the sunny atmosphere near the town's main church. Half an hour or so passed and I went back to the bus station and got on the next bus to Lille.

This bus driver wouldn't accept coins, so I walked past the driver to the card sensor and pretended to scan the card and sat down.

We set off, and after about five stops a bus conductor gets on and asks for everyone's ticket.

I offer my card but he refuses, saying I must step outside with him and pay a 50 euro fine.

The bus sets off and three conductors, three police armed with tazers and myself at a quiet bus stop half way between the town and the metro half an hour away, my mental tiredness grew and I said I'll pay for my ticket, but I won't pay 50 euros I can't afford it. 

After a few minutes discussion amongst the conductors, the guy came back and said as a one off they will let me go, but not back on a bus. Bof, I said, and set off walking.
It wasn't so bad, I thought to myself as I walked the half hour to the metro through the sunny semi-countryside.

I reached the metro and one of the gates was open while the others required a ticket to open. I subtly glanced around the building and entered, and went up the stairs to the train. 

A handful of conductors were stood at the train doors, inspecting tickets. ""It's a goddamn conspiracy, I thought to myself, and not for the first time.

I walked back down stairs and the previously open gate had closed, trapping me in. A feeling of the Universe trying to cause my impending doom grew on me and I weighed my options.

There was no security at these doors, and I waited for someone to enter from the other side and speed-walked through after they had passed me.

The barrier slammed shut onto my backpack, beeping loudly. I pulled against it, and after a few seconds holding me tight like the teeth of a hound, it reluctantly opened for a few seconds to let me through.

Cursing whatever is enforcing I either walk double digit kilometres into Lille or buy a ticket, I buy a plastic ticket with a one hour journey for 2.80, scan through the barrier, up the stairs, get scanned by a guard and take the metro to the train station metro. 

 I realised after exiting the metro that I had somehow misread where the train was and was a couple of stations from the train station.

I set off walking, then remembered I had the ticket to travel but thought it wasn't too far, and I'll see some of the city I hadn't seen before.

I called into a supermarket for some liquid, being only able to drink so much espresso and the orange juice long gone, buying two litres of ice tea and a couple of reduced price chicken slices for a few euros.

Quite hot by that point with my backpack, I sat at the entrance to a small church and drank heavily, eating a slice of chicken.

Looking at the people and the supermarket and the bar and cafe, I realised that each city district is like a village in itself, everything one such would have in a few minutes square walking area.

I walked as the weather grew hotter, past school children holding hands, past a college, and then past several different buildings having their hedges trimmed (Wednesday must be the French day of trimming your hedge or something, they were doing it along the bus route as well) and then a few minutes later entered the train station.

I look for the Paris trains, and see one quietly guarded by two people. 

Accepting the date of buying a ticket (grrr) I asked where the ticket machine was. The guard pointed where it was. I thanked him and walked to where he was pointing.

He walked with me, then started pressing the translate to English button, then the Paris button. I said ""I'm fine now merci."" and then he walked away and then machine asked for my email address and French phone number for my e-ticket.

Anger grew at asking for help from someone patronising, I beckoned for the guard who walked over. He said it doesn't matter and gave a fake address of the transport company and a telephone number 06 000000.

I thanked him and waited for my ticket to print. Collecting it I walked back to the guard and his partner. I showed him the ticket and he said I was at the wrong station for this train. The train was due in 9 minutes.

After paying 55 Euros (!!!) for the 1 hour journey, I started panicking realising I wouldn't get a refund or let on this train. He told me it wasn't far, just across the bridge.
Grabbing my backpack tightly, I ran up the escalator and ran for the bridge.

I noticed a sign that said ""Station 10 minutes"" with a pair of footprints and increased my pace. I don't know what my backpack weighs but it's enough, and the heat was strong.

I ran a minute or two, walked for half a minute noticing my lack of running with weight strength since my army days and my increase of cigarettes, and then ran for a few minutes more.

I ran over the road from the bridge to where the sign pointed, a large shopping centre I knew from the other day was connected to the train station, several minutes walking through busy consumers.

Bollocks to that, I ran around the corner of the building and saw out of the corner of my eye the sign reading ""... des Flanders"" and ran for it, watching as I ran hoping the missing word was Gare. It was, and I entered the train.

Thankfully the platform for the Paris train was close to the entrance, and people were having their tickets checked for the train. Somehow I even had a few minutes spare.

I boarded the train and got my breath back over a few minutes.

The train was comfortable, I was on the second floor and the seats were large.

The train quietly departed, and I found myself getting indiscernibly angry and I noticed the passengers making eye contact, the guy in a baseball cap opposite me seeming to react similarly to intrusive thoughts before quickly standing up and leaving the carriage for a few minutes.

Using the free WiFi I started to message my parents and browse Reddit, though my phone wasn't working properly and was doing different things to what my thumbs were telling it to.

My battery was a few percent and the cable or the plug or the phone kept losing charge periodically, causing me to stop what I'm doing and adjust it.

The WiFi kept disconnecting, requiring manual reauthorisation each time, and these little things all had their affects.

After messaging my parents and their suggestion of looking for a replacement phone I watched the rest of the journey via the windows of the train, relaxing at the fantastic scenery of France.",1,1748537923.0,vagabond,1,0.67,False
1kyfyy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kyfyy6/help_assessing_chemistry_on_the_third_date/,Help assessing chemistry on the third date?,"So I (25M) am going on a third date with a wonderful lady tonight (27F).

On the first date, we met at a diner for lunch and had about a 90 minute nonstop conversation. I was really enjoying talking to her to the point that it was hard to even eat much of my food lol. I'd had 2 cups of coffee so excused myself to the restroom. When I came back, she said she had to go because her dad was calling her needing her to show up with her dog at a cousin's prom pictures or something along those lines. While it was (at least in my view) a really good conversation, there wasn't really a physical spark. Just hugs hello and goodbye. 

In the moment, I kind of figured she decided she didn't like me and that was the opportunity for her to get out of there. To my surprise she texted me shortly after that she had fun and wanted to go out again which was awesome because I was definitely into her. 

We're both pretty busy so couldn't line up on date 2 until this past Monday. I had something really good planned, but didn't realize that they were closed on Mondays so pivoted to plan B which was to go to a bar in a nearby trendy neighborhood to have a drink or 2 with some appetizers and then maybe have a night cap at another bar in the neighborhood. A little more fun than just a quick saturday lunch, I figured.

Well, that plan was dead on arrival when she just stuck with water. Nothing wrong at all with her not ordering a drink, but it felt like it would not be a good idea to suggest bouncing to another bar after that. So we went and got some ice cream before I took her home for the night. 

Now, between the two dates and 4 ish hours we have spent together, there's been a total of maybe about 60 seconds of solid eye contact. Normally, I would take that as a sign of disinterest, but since she's agreed to a third date I don't think that's the case. And even if it was disinterest, I still feel like there would usually be more eye contact than there has been just naturally from conversation. Also, I realize that the above may read as if she's just content to be taken out for some free meals. While I can't rule that out, my instincts tell me this isn't the case. 

It feels like it wouldn't be a good idea to be like ""hey, why won't you make eye contact"". We definitely click conversationally and have some shared interests, but there hasn't been much beyond that yet.

I'm just looking for some advice of how to explore if there's really any chemistry here. I am definitely very attracted to her and I think her to me as well. I think we're just both kinda shy!",1,1748537902.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1kyfw5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1kyfw5u/we_never_asked_the_aliens/,We Never Asked the Aliens,"Holden sat on the porch, chewing on a piece of straw like it was his job, eyes squinting into the sun that cooked the dirt into something close to pottery. 

He didn’t move much, not because he was lazy, but because everything that needed moving was already dead or bolted down. His shirt clung to his back, soaked through, and a fat bead of sweat rolled from under his cap, down the side of his neck.

The heat was familiar, but today felt like something was off, like the sky was holding its breath. He looked out across the fields, squinting as a sharp glint cut across the sky. It moved too slow to be a plane, too quiet to be a chopper, and too smooth to be any Earth-made thing.

At first, he thought it was a reflection off a weather balloon or maybe some NASA hardware falling out of orbit again. Then it started descending in a wobble, fast enough to make him sit up and kick his chair back. The glint turned into a full-on object, bigger than his barn, long like a train car but thicker in the middle, and burning orange at the edges like it was hitting friction. It didn’t crash with a bang.

It slid across the field like a tossed skillet on ice, carving a ditch five feet deep into his corn rows and flipping his irrigation system into a shredded mess of pipes and twisted metal. Cows screamed in the distance. Something was burning, maybe it was the crops, maybe it was the machine, maybe both.

Holden grabbed his shotgun off the porch rail and jogged toward the mess, boots thudding across dry dirt that now smoked with the stink of burning plastic and soil. A few of the cows lay still, necks bent wrong, eyes wide open. One twitched and let out a low groan, and he put a slug in it without hesitating.

This wasn’t his first day with death. He'd put down animals before, and this one had no business suffering for whatever just dropped from the sky. The object was half-buried, some kind of hull breached open like a broken watermelon. Something moved inside, slow, clumsy movements like an overgrown insect trying to right itself.

He took a few steps closer, keeping the barrel level. A shape uncurled from the wreck, tall and thin like someone had stretched a lizard upright and gave it armor. It blinked at him with no mouth, no face, just two big black eyes that caught the sunlight and reflected it like tar.

The thing raised a hand, not fast, more like a wave or a peace sign. Holden shot it center mass. The creature fell like it had no bones, just folded in half and dropped. He walked over, poked it with the barrel, then kicked it once to make sure. It didn’t move. He leaned down, looked into one of those big black eyes. The thing smelled like wet copper and pine tar.

He spit next to the corpse and stood up straight. ""Should’ve landed somewhere else,"" he muttered. Then the second one showed up, crawling out the other end of the wreck, dragging what looked like a toolbox. Holden fired again, caught the second one in the leg, and it went down screaming in a pitch too high for a human throat.

It clutched its limb and made a noise like boiling tea kettles. He hesitated this time, lowered the barrel a bit. It didn’t look like it was armed. Just hurt, scared maybe. Then it pressed something on the box it carried, and a small blue light pulsed from the edge.

That’s when the porch blew apart.

He hit the ground sideways, ears ringing, body covered in splinters and dirt. The explosion had come from behind him, maybe fifty feet back. The top half of his house was gone, the roof thrown into the treeline. Flames licked out of the side windows and the screen door clattered into the dirt like trash in the wind.

He rolled over and saw the alien, still crawling, holding that damn box and pointing it like a flashlight. Holden didn’t think twice. He aimed for the head and pulled the trigger. The thing jerked once and dropped the device.

The fire caught fast. He ran to the wreck and ripped out anything that looked useful, metal rods, a heavy knife-looking tool, something that hummed like a car battery. He shoved them all into a wheelbarrow and rolled it toward the back shed, coughing as smoke followed him across the yard.

By the time the fire crews showed up, ten minutes later, maybe fifteen, the house was ash and heat, and Holden stood there, shirt half-burned, holding a wheelbarrow full of alien junk, shotgun slung across his back. One of the firemen asked what the hell happened.

He told them the truth. “Aliens landed, took out my cows and my porch. I shot two. One blew up the house. That’s all I got.” The man didn’t argue. Another called it in to the sheriff, who showed up drunk and mad and not in that order.

Holden told it again. They walked around the wreck, kicked the bodies, argued over who to call. By nightfall, the National Guard had arrived with a convoy of black trucks and zero patience.

They put up tape and lights, blocked the road, shoved cameras in everyone’s face. Holden sat in the back of one of their jeeps, drinking their water, staring at his smoking house while men in suits argued about protocols.

One of the men in a uniform with too many buttons sat next to him, opened a folder, and started asking questions in a calm voice. Holden answered all of them without fuss. Yes, he saw them land. No, he didn’t provoke them. Yes, he fired first. No, he didn’t regret it. When the officer asked why he didn’t wait or try to communicate, Holden looked him straight in the face.

“They landed on my damn corn and killed two cows. That’s an act of war in Texas.”

The officer blinked, wrote something down, and walked away. Holden stayed in the jeep, drank more water, and watched the soldiers set up lights and tarp over the wreckage. He figured they’d try to make sense of it, like they always did. Study the tech, cut the bodies open, run tests.

He didn’t care. All he wanted was a new roof, a few less reporters, and someone to reimburse his livestock. Instead, a general showed up around midnight, pulled him into a tent, and played him a video.

The video showed five more ships coming down, same model, different counties. Montana, Kentucky, Arizona. One went into a lake, one landed on a retirement home. Same kind of damage. A few fires, some property destroyed, one whole wedding got cooked by jet wash. The aliens didn’t shoot.

They didn’t say anything either. They just walked out like they’d arrived for a barbecue. Most of them didn’t survive the first hour. The general said the pattern looked bad. Every time they landed, folks assumed it was an invasion. Guns came out, bodies hit the ground, and nobody tried a translator.

“Your incident was the first,” the general said.

Holden nodded, not proud, not ashamed. Just listening.

“So you shot the first contact.”

Holden shrugged. “Looked like it needed shootin’.”

The general didn’t argue. He just sighed and rubbed his eyes. Outside, someone was yelling into a radio. More landings. More civilians reacting. One poor bastard threw dynamite into a hatch before asking what the thing inside was. Another shot his own tractor thinking it had been replaced by alien tech. Panic spread faster than facts.

The next morning, Holden watched on a borrowed phone as cities started evacuating. People weren’t waiting for instructions anymore. They were pulling the trigger. Mobs took over highways. Stores got looted. Rumors flew.

Some said the aliens were here to harvest organs. Others thought it was a prison drop, dumping criminals into rural zones. Nobody had real answers. And still the ships kept coming.

He walked the edge of his property line that afternoon, watching soldiers post up checkpoints. His fields were gone, scorched or buried. His cattle were dead. He had no house. And the aliens, whatever they were, kept dropping in like pizza delivery. He didn’t understand it, and he didn’t want to. All he knew was Earth wasn’t the place to land if you didn’t want a fight.

He leaned against a fence post and lit a cigarette with a hand that still shook a little from the blast. Out in the distance, he saw another shape in the sky. This one landed cleaner, maybe fifty miles out. The smoke plume rose slow. The wind carried the smell his way. Burnt soil. Scorched wires. Blood.

He puffed once, then twice, and flicked the match away.

“Y’all picked the wrong planet,” he muttered.

The fence creaked beside him. Someone had hung an alien’s helmet on it like a trophy.

He didn’t ask who.

They brought more of them in on stretchers, bodies burned or torn in half, some with parts missing, others twitching with no visible wounds. Holden watched from the barn that hadn’t burned, sitting on a crate, drinking warm beer, and chewing on a strip of jerky like nothing important was happening.

He’d already given his statement to two different officials and signed off on some form the government insisted was necessary for “biohazard release rights.” They didn’t offer him any compensation. They just gave him a folder full of warnings and told him not to touch any glowing parts from the ship.

The news played nonstop on the radios now. Every channel screamed about invasions, attacks, new landings. Some senators were calling it the beginning of a global war. Other people said it was a big accident, that the aliens were just lost. Holden didn’t care about motives.

All he knew was that his house was gone, two of his cows were in pieces, and the local town gas station was selling t-shirts with his face on it and the words “First Blood: Earth Wins Round One.”

The real mess didn’t start until the third wave came down. That one hit near a high school in Oklahoma and killed a marching band during practice. One of the ships landed on the football field, crushed half the bleachers, and broke every window in the gym. The kids ran. The staff panicked.

Police showed up, saw a group of seven-foot aliens stepping off a smoking ship, and opened fire before anyone asked a question. Two officers died when the aliens’ emergency beacon lit up and exploded in a radius blast. Four students were injured by shrapnel.

The town went silent for five hours, and then the military showed up and took control of the whole region.

People started assuming the worst after that. Everyone with a rifle, shotgun, or garden hoe started setting up roadblocks. Pickup trucks with flags, spotlights, and lawn chairs filled every freeway entrance.

In Texas, some towns had meetings where people volunteered to take shifts on rooftops with scoped rifles. No one asked if the aliens meant harm anymore. They just assumed it, and started prepping accordingly. That’s when Holden figured it wasn’t going to slow down anytime soon.

By the time two more ships landed in Louisiana and clipped a church steeple and a water tower, people weren’t even shocked. It was routine. Ships came down. Something exploded. People screamed. Local militias jumped in. Government followed. Body count went up. Repeat. Holden kept a list taped to the barn wall.

He scratched new landings into the wood with a pocketknife. Thirteen ships in four days. Two landed in lakes. One flattened a herd of goats. Another came in upside-down and drilled straight into a quarry, exploding on contact.

The next ship that came near Holden’s county landed smoother, but still managed to destroy a bait shop and scare a nearby wedding party into firing blindly into the woods. A deputy lost part of his ear when someone mistook him for an alien in a fog bank. Three bridesmaids passed out from panic.

When the smoke cleared, the ship hadn’t even opened its hatch. People walked up to it with bats and hammers, started beating on the hull, yelling for whatever was inside to come out. They dragged out two survivors and strung them from a billboard, then called the sheriff and asked what to do next. The sheriff didn’t know, so he called the Guard. The Guard told them to stand down. Nobody listened.

Holden drove to the scene that evening, mostly to see if the aliens were still there. What he saw was a crowd eating chili out of paper bowls, watching the dead aliens sway in the wind like nothing strange was happening. One of the locals was selling souvenir mugs with alien heads on them. Another guy had a grill going.

It looked like a picnic with corpses. He walked through the crowd, nodded at a few faces he recognized, and stopped near the ship. It still smoked a little, and one of the doors was jammed half open. Inside, blinking lights and cables hung like intestines. He stepped back and left it alone.

By nightfall, the government declared twelve counties under “civil quarantine.” That meant roadblocks, curfews, and unmarked helicopters. It also meant more boots on the ground. Soldiers patrolled small towns, eyes wide and rifles ready.

Holden didn’t trust the uniforms, but they were better than letting civilians do all the work. At least the military had maps and radios. Most civilians just had rage, half a tank of gas, and bad aim.

One unit camped near Holden’s property, a mobile comms team with tents and satellite dishes. They brought rations, ammo, and a field medic. One of them tried to talk to Holden about protocols, alien contact guidelines, and non-lethal containment.

Holden laughed, then showed him the barn wall with the ship count. “They show up, they wreck things, someone dies. That’s the only pattern I see,” he said. The soldier didn’t argue. He just handed over some water bottles and moved on.

More ships came. More towns fought back. A group in Kansas used a combine harvester as a battering ram. Another group in Tennessee rolled dynamite down a hill into a ship’s open hatch.

In Florida, someone strapped chainsaws to drones and sent them after a scout team. Footage spread online. Headlines exploded with phrases like “Human Resistance,” “Rural Defense Initiative,” and “Battle for Earth.” Holden rolled his eyes at most of it. There wasn’t any resistance. Just people doing what they always did when something foreign showed up and didn’t say hello properly.

Nobody knew what the aliens wanted. They didn’t shoot first. They didn’t speak. They just landed, broke a bunch of stuff, then stood around like confused tourists. The theory was that the ships had faulty navigation or bad translations. Maybe they thought Earth was still uninhabited.

Maybe they didn’t care. Either way, they didn’t last long enough to explain themselves. The longest any group of them stayed alive after landing was thirteen minutes. That one got stabbed by a farmer using a hoe sharpened on both sides.

Holden got a visit from a federal agent three days later. The man wore a windbreaker with too many zippers and showed credentials nobody cared to verify. He walked straight into the barn, sat on an overturned bucket, and said, “We think the aliens are sending distress signals back.”

Holden nodded and took another sip from his thermos. “And?” he asked. The agent stared at him for a moment, then said, “We think more are coming, not to invade, but to look for the ones we already killed.” Holden scratched the side of his head and looked over at the wreckage still rusting in his back field. “Then I guess they’ll die, too,” he said.

The agent didn’t laugh. He stood, told Holden to stay alert, and left without saying goodbye. Two hours later, a low humming sound filled the air. Not loud, but constant. A pulse, like pressure in your ears before a storm.

Holden stepped outside and looked up. The sky was full of blinking lights, dozens of them, spread out in a loose formation. They didn’t dive. They didn’t attack. They just hovered, waiting.

People panicked. Phones lit up. Radios went silent. In the towns, folks packed into basements. In the cities, riots kicked off. Nobody fired the first shot this time. The aliens didn’t land.

They just floated there, engines thrumming like an industrial warning. Holden stood in the middle of his dirt lot, shotgun resting in the crook of his arm, and waited. Nothing happened for six hours.

At dawn, a single pod dropped down near a reservoir in New Mexico. It didn’t open. People surrounded it with trucks and flamethrowers. Someone dropped a backhoe on top of it, and when it cracked open, there was nothing inside. Just tools, water, and a machine that looked like a 3D printer. It wasn’t an invasion ship. It was a maintenance drone. A tech repair unit. They had sent down a tool chest.

Holden read about it in a classified memo passed to the comms team on a torn printout. He rubbed his face, stared at the fire barrel burning near the tents, and said nothing. Everyone knew what it meant. The ships weren’t soldiers.

They weren’t even scouts. They were techs, mechanics, maybe explorers. They were here for some reason nobody had bothered to ask before pulling triggers. But the body count was past the point of fixing. There was no going back now.

Still, the ships hovered. Still, no one landed.

Everyone on Earth waited.

The ships didn’t move for three more days. They held position in the sky like statues with engines. No new landings. No lights from inside. No signals that anyone could interpret.

The government pulled together everyone they could find who spoke anything close to interstellar protocol. Experts from NASA, the Pentagon, some think tank in Sweden, even a guy from a UFO podcast. They sat in a tent with too much coffee and too many opinions, arguing over how to interpret silence.

Holden didn’t join those meetings. He had nothing to offer except a shotgun, a burned barn, and thirty-seven confirmed alien body sightings on his land. Instead, he spent most of his time fixing the fence where the heat from the wreck had warped the posts.

His back hurt and his knees cracked, but he worked anyway. The farm had to be cleaned up eventually, whether there were aliens overhead or not. He didn’t want the cattle wandering once he got replacements.

Around noon on the fourth day, one of the smaller ships lowered from the sky and touched down just outside city limits in Amarillo. This time, no fire, no explosion, no crashing through buildings. It landed on the outskirts, in a clear stretch of field, as if it had been waiting for permission. No one fired. People watched it through binoculars, drones, and scopes. Still, nothing came out. It sat there until dusk.

Then, a ramp extended from the side. No soldiers emerged. No weapons. Instead, a panel opened and a crate rolled down the ramp and settled in the dirt. It beeped once. Then silence. That was all. A machine rolled down a ramp, beeped, and stopped moving.

The military sent a robot to investigate. It scanned the crate, cracked it open, and found sealed containers inside. Equipment, medical supplies, and what looked like biological analysis kits. No explosives. No weapons. Just tools.

The general in charge called a meeting and laid the facts out for anyone who wanted to listen. He said the aliens weren’t here to fight. They were responding to some unknown signal, probably a distress beacon triggered by their own ships. He said the ones who came before had landed without protocols because their systems thought Earth was safe.

Nobody cared. In the bars, people drank and joked about alien weaklings who didn’t even shoot back. At churches, people talked about divine protection. On news feeds, headlines kept changing. “Aliens Bring Tools, Not War,” followed by “Government Lies About Threat Level.” Trust had collapsed by then.

Nobody believed anything unless they saw it for themselves. Holden believed the evidence. He believed what he’d seen and shot. But he also believed that once a war starts, it doesn’t matter who was wrong at the beginning.

When the sixth support ship landed outside of Lubbock, someone had already strapped C4 to a grain silo and waited. The second the hatch opened, they detonated it. The shockwave took out two city blocks and killed twenty civilians.

Only one alien had been inside. That footage went viral, and within twelve hours, five other landings were met with armed mobs. People stopped caring about reasons. The aliens were intruders. That was enough.

Holden stood near the wreckage of his own yard and watched one of the smaller ships hover lower than usual. It buzzed just above the tree line like it was scanning. No doors opened. No beams came down. It floated there for an hour, then rose again and joined the others.

He finished hammering the fencepost and walked back to the barn. On the way, he stepped over a melted piece of one of the first ships, black and twisted like metal left in a forge. He didn’t look at it long. He just moved past it.

That night, the sky turned red as three more landings ended in fires. One of the alien crews tried to broadcast a signal. Some translation finally worked, but all it said was “Maintenance in progress. Do not interfere.” Nobody listened. The signal played twice, and then the ship was torn apart by a combine with steel-plated blades driven by a man who lost his brother in the first incident. No one stopped him.

By morning, Holden knew what would come next. You don’t kill twenty, thirty, a hundred of something without a response. Whether they were peaceful or not, someone up there was watching the casualty count rise.

He looked out over the hills and watched a distant fire burn against the horizon. Another town gone. Another group of ships probably circling above trying to figure out why Earth kept killing everything they sent down.

The military began falling back from the rural areas. Too many civilians getting in the way. Too many homegrown militias taking potshots at anything shiny. Holden had seen them up close, pickup trucks with mounted barrels, duct-taped gear, beer coolers, and enough ammo to hold a fortress. They weren’t organized, but they didn’t need to be. They weren’t fighting a war. They were just waiting for more targets.

Holden filled two jugs of water and stored them in the barn, right next to his repaired shotgun and a crowbar. He wasn’t planning to go anywhere. The aliens hadn’t come back to his land, and if they did, he’d deal with them the same as last time. But part of him started thinking about how it all began.

Not from a place of guilt. Just simple math. First contact ended with bullets. Then came explosions. Then came silence. Then came escalation. It followed a line. It had a rhythm.

Late that evening, someone dropped a new message from the aliens into every open frequency. This time, no translator was needed. It was audio, played in multiple languages. “Evacuation requested. Crew retrieval in process. Cease hostilities. Environment not suitable for peaceful contact.” That was it. Four lines, repeated every ten minutes for six hours. People ignored it. Others mocked it. Some believed it was a trick.

The general came back to Holden’s barn the next morning. He wasn’t wearing his jacket this time. Just a plain shirt and boots, dust on his face, and a tired look like he’d been awake for days. He asked Holden what he thought about the new message.

Holden just looked at him and said, “Sounds like they’re giving up.” The general nodded. “Or regrouping.” Holden didn’t answer. He just walked back to the fence, checked the wire, and pulled the slack.

In the last three days, not one ship landed. Not one crate dropped. Not one signal was sent besides the evacuation broadcast. The sky stayed full of ships, but none of them moved. It was like they had frozen in place, watching, recording, judging.

Nobody knew what came next. Holden figured that if they were smart, they’d leave. If they were dumb, they’d try again. Either way, Earth wasn’t changing for them.

That final night, Holden sat on a folding chair next to the barn, beer in hand, staring at the stars. He could still see the faint outline of three ships in the upper atmosphere. They looked closer than they were, just large enough to be visible if you knew where to look.

He didn’t wave at them. He didn’t curse them either. He just sat still, boots planted firm in the dirt, and watched.

Someone nearby fired off a bottle rocket. Maybe celebrating. Maybe testing a launcher. Holden didn’t look. The sound of distant gunfire rolled in from the south. Another town must have spotted something strange.

He leaned back in the chair, stared straight up, and wondered how many of those ships had cameras. Maybe they were broadcasting Earth’s reaction to the rest of their kind. Maybe they were already filing reports back home.

The thought crossed his mind, not bitter, just quiet. What if none of this was meant to happen? What if they really did just land by mistake? What if the whole thing was a tech glitch, and they landed on a planet that responded to confusion with bullets and fire?

Holden didn’t lose sleep over it. He hadn’t asked for visitors. He hadn’t invited them. And once they landed, they made their choices, same as him.

He finished the beer, crushed the can in one hand, and tossed it into a pile of scrap. The barn light flickered once, then went out. Power lines were shaky ever since the last EMP from one of the crash sites. He didn’t bother fixing them. Candles worked fine, and the fridge didn’t have anything left in it anyway. The wind blew dirt across the field. He smelled smoke again, somewhere far off.

He went inside the barn, climbed into the cot set up next to the wall, and pulled a tarp over his legs. The sounds outside were calm. Crickets.

Distant humming from one of the ships still overhead. A single engine passed on the highway. Nothing urgent. No alarms. Just another night on Earth, with the sky still full of things that didn’t belong.

One thought crossed his mind as sleep took over.

We never asked the aliens if they had really come to Earth to fight.

1kyfvtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SciFiTime/comments/1kyfvtb/we_never_asked_the_aliens/,We Never Asked the Aliens,"Holden sat on the porch, chewing on a piece of straw like it was his job, eyes squinting into the sun that cooked the dirt into something close to pottery. He didn’t move much, not because he was lazy, but because everything that needed moving was already dead or bolted down. His shirt clung to his back, soaked through, and a fat bead of sweat rolled from under his cap, down the side of his neck.

The heat was familiar, but today felt like something was off, like the sky was holding its breath. He looked out across the fields, squinting as a sharp glint cut across the sky. It moved too slow to be a plane, too quiet to be a chopper, and too smooth to be any Earth-made thing.

At first, he thought it was a reflection off a weather balloon or maybe some NASA hardware falling out of orbit again. Then it started descending in a wobble, fast enough to make him sit up and kick his chair back. The glint turned into a full-on object, bigger than his barn, long like a train car but thicker in the middle, and burning orange at the edges like it was hitting friction. It didn’t crash with a bang.

It slid across the field like a tossed skillet on ice, carving a ditch five feet deep into his corn rows and flipping his irrigation system into a shredded mess of pipes and twisted metal. Cows screamed in the distance. Something was burning, maybe it was the crops, maybe it was the machine, maybe both.

Holden grabbed his shotgun off the porch rail and jogged toward the mess, boots thudding across dry dirt that now smoked with the stink of burning plastic and soil. A few of the cows lay still, necks bent wrong, eyes wide open. One twitched and let out a low groan, and he put a slug in it without hesitating.

This wasn’t his first day with death. He'd put down animals before, and this one had no business suffering for whatever just dropped from the sky. The object was half-buried, some kind of hull breached open like a broken watermelon. Something moved inside, slow, clumsy movements like an overgrown insect trying to right itself.

He took a few steps closer, keeping the barrel level. A shape uncurled from the wreck, tall and thin like someone had stretched a lizard upright and gave it armor. It blinked at him with no mouth, no face, just two big black eyes that caught the sunlight and reflected it like tar.

The thing raised a hand, not fast, more like a wave or a peace sign. Holden shot it center mass. The creature fell like it had no bones, just folded in half and dropped. He walked over, poked it with the barrel, then kicked it once to make sure. It didn’t move. He leaned down, looked into one of those big black eyes. The thing smelled like wet copper and pine tar.

He spit next to the corpse and stood up straight. ""Should’ve landed somewhere else,"" he muttered. Then the second one showed up, crawling out the other end of the wreck, dragging what looked like a toolbox. Holden fired again, caught the second one in the leg, and it went down screaming in a pitch too high for a human throat.

It clutched its limb and made a noise like boiling tea kettles. He hesitated this time, lowered the barrel a bit. It didn’t look like it was armed. Just hurt, scared maybe. Then it pressed something on the box it carried, and a small blue light pulsed from the edge.

That’s when the porch blew apart.

He hit the ground sideways, ears ringing, body covered in splinters and dirt. The explosion had come from behind him, maybe fifty feet back. The top half of his house was gone, the roof thrown into the treeline. Flames licked out of the side windows and the screen door clattered into the dirt like trash in the wind.

He rolled over and saw the alien, still crawling, holding that damn box and pointing it like a flashlight. Holden didn’t think twice. He aimed for the head and pulled the trigger. The thing jerked once and dropped the device.

The fire caught fast. He ran to the wreck and ripped out anything that looked useful, metal rods, a heavy knife-looking tool, something that hummed like a car battery. He shoved them all into a wheelbarrow and rolled it toward the back shed, coughing as smoke followed him across the yard.

By the time the fire crews showed up, ten minutes later, maybe fifteen, the house was ash and heat, and Holden stood there, shirt half-burned, holding a wheelbarrow full of alien junk, shotgun slung across his back. One of the firemen asked what the hell happened.

He told them the truth. “Aliens landed, took out my cows and my porch. I shot two. One blew up the house. That’s all I got.” The man didn’t argue. Another called it in to the sheriff, who showed up drunk and mad and not in that order.

Holden told it again. They walked around the wreck, kicked the bodies, argued over who to call. By nightfall, the National Guard had arrived with a convoy of black trucks and zero patience.

They put up tape and lights, blocked the road, shoved cameras in everyone’s face. Holden sat in the back of one of their jeeps, drinking their water, staring at his smoking house while men in suits argued about protocols.

One of the men in a uniform with too many buttons sat next to him, opened a folder, and started asking questions in a calm voice. Holden answered all of them without fuss. Yes, he saw them land. No, he didn’t provoke them. Yes, he fired first. No, he didn’t regret it. When the officer asked why he didn’t wait or try to communicate, Holden looked him straight in the face.

“They landed on my damn corn and killed two cows. That’s an act of war in Texas.”

The officer blinked, wrote something down, and walked away. Holden stayed in the jeep, drank more water, and watched the soldiers set up lights and tarp over the wreckage. He figured they’d try to make sense of it, like they always did. Study the tech, cut the bodies open, run tests.

He didn’t care. All he wanted was a new roof, a few less reporters, and someone to reimburse his livestock. Instead, a general showed up around midnight, pulled him into a tent, and played him a video.

The video showed five more ships coming down, same model, different counties. Montana, Kentucky, Arizona. One went into a lake, one landed on a retirement home. Same kind of damage. A few fires, some property destroyed, one whole wedding got cooked by jet wash. The aliens didn’t shoot.

They didn’t say anything either. They just walked out like they’d arrived for a barbecue. Most of them didn’t survive the first hour. The general said the pattern looked bad. Every time they landed, folks assumed it was an invasion. Guns came out, bodies hit the ground, and nobody tried a translator.

“Your incident was the first,” the general said.

Holden nodded, not proud, not ashamed. Just listening.

“So you shot the first contact.”

Holden shrugged. “Looked like it needed shootin’.”

The general didn’t argue. He just sighed and rubbed his eyes. Outside, someone was yelling into a radio. More landings. More civilians reacting. One poor bastard threw dynamite into a hatch before asking what the thing inside was. Another shot his own tractor thinking it had been replaced by alien tech. Panic spread faster than facts.

The next morning, Holden watched on a borrowed phone as cities started evacuating. People weren’t waiting for instructions anymore. They were pulling the trigger. Mobs took over highways. Stores got looted. Rumors flew.

Some said the aliens were here to harvest organs. Others thought it was a prison drop, dumping criminals into rural zones. Nobody had real answers. And still the ships kept coming.

He walked the edge of his property line that afternoon, watching soldiers post up checkpoints. His fields were gone, scorched or buried. His cattle were dead. He had no house. And the aliens, whatever they were, kept dropping in like pizza delivery. He didn’t understand it, and he didn’t want to. All he knew was Earth wasn’t the place to land if you didn’t want a fight.

He leaned against a fence post and lit a cigarette with a hand that still shook a little from the blast. Out in the distance, he saw another shape in the sky. This one landed cleaner, maybe fifty miles out. The smoke plume rose slow. The wind carried the smell his way. Burnt soil. Scorched wires. Blood.

He puffed once, then twice, and flicked the match away.

“Y’all picked the wrong planet,” he muttered.

The fence creaked beside him. Someone had hung an alien’s helmet on it like a trophy.

He didn’t ask who.

They brought more of them in on stretchers, bodies burned or torn in half, some with parts missing, others twitching with no visible wounds. Holden watched from the barn that hadn’t burned, sitting on a crate, drinking warm beer, and chewing on a strip of jerky like nothing important was happening.

He’d already given his statement to two different officials and signed off on some form the government insisted was necessary for “biohazard release rights.” They didn’t offer him any compensation. They just gave him a folder full of warnings and told him not to touch any glowing parts from the ship.

The news played nonstop on the radios now. Every channel screamed about invasions, attacks, new landings. Some senators were calling it the beginning of a global war. Other people said it was a big accident, that the aliens were just lost. Holden didn’t care about motives.

All he knew was that his house was gone, two of his cows were in pieces, and the local town gas station was selling t-shirts with his face on it and the words “First Blood: Earth Wins Round One.”

The real mess didn’t start until the third wave came down. That one hit near a high school in Oklahoma and killed a marching band during practice. One of the ships landed on the football field, crushed half the bleachers, and broke every window in the gym. The kids ran. The staff panicked.

Police showed up, saw a group of seven-foot aliens stepping off a smoking ship, and opened fire before anyone asked a question. Two officers died when the aliens’ emergency beacon lit up and exploded in a radius blast. Four students were injured by shrapnel.

By the time two more ships landed in Louisiana and clipped a church steeple and a water tower, people weren’t even shocked. It was routine. Ships came down. Something exploded. People screamed. Local militias jumped in. Government followed. Body count went up. Repeat. Holden kept a list taped to the barn wall.

He scratched new landings into the wood with a pocketknife. Thirteen ships in four days. Two landed in lakes. One flattened a herd of goats. Another came in upside-down and drilled straight into a quarry, exploding on contact.

The next ship that came near Holden’s county landed smoother, but still managed to destroy a bait shop and scare a nearby wedding party into firing blindly into the woods. A deputy lost part of his ear when someone mistook him for an alien in a fog bank. Three bridesmaids passed out from panic.

When the smoke cleared, the ship hadn’t even opened its hatch. People walked up to it with bats and hammers, started beating on the hull, yelling for whatever was inside to come out. They dragged out two survivors and strung them from a billboard, then called the sheriff and asked what to do next. The sheriff didn’t know, so he called the Guard. The Guard told them to stand down. Nobody listened.

Holden drove to the scene that evening, mostly to see if the aliens were still there. What he saw was a crowd eating chili out of paper bowls, watching the dead aliens sway in the wind like nothing strange was happening.

One unit camped near Holden’s property, a mobile comms team with tents and satellite dishes. They brought rations, ammo, and a field medic. One of them tried to talk to Holden about protocols, alien contact guidelines, and non-lethal containment.

Holden laughed, then showed him the barn wall with the ship count. “They show up, they wreck things, someone dies. That’s the only pattern I see,” he said. The soldier didn’t argue. He just handed over some water bottles and moved on.

More ships came. More towns fought back. A group in Kansas used a combine harvester as a battering ram. Another group in Tennessee rolled dynamite down a hill into a ship’s open hatch.

In Florida, someone strapped chainsaws to drones and sent them after a scout team. Footage spread online. Headlines exploded with phrases like “Human Resistance,” “Rural Defense Initiative,” and “Battle for Earth.” Holden rolled his eyes at most of it. There wasn’t any resistance. Just people doing what they always did when something foreign showed up and didn’t say hello properly.

Nobody knew what the aliens wanted. They didn’t shoot first. They didn’t speak. They just landed, broke a bunch of stuff, then stood around like confused tourists. The theory was that the ships had faulty navigation or bad translations. Maybe they thought Earth was still uninhabited.

Maybe they didn’t care. Either way, they didn’t last long enough to explain themselves. The longest any group of them stayed alive after landing was thirteen minutes. That one got stabbed by a farmer using a hoe sharpened on both sides.

Holden got a visit from a federal agent three days later. The man wore a windbreaker with too many zippers and showed credentials nobody cared to verify. He walked straight into the barn, sat on an overturned bucket, and said, “We think the aliens are sending distress signals back.”

Holden nodded and took another sip from his thermos. “And?” he asked. The agent stared at him for a moment, then said, “We think more are coming, not to invade, but to look for the ones we already killed.” Holden scratched the side of his head and looked over at the wreckage still rusting in his back field. “Then I guess they’ll die, too,” he said.

The agent didn’t laugh. He stood, told Holden to stay alert, and left without saying goodbye. Two hours later, a low humming sound filled the air. Not loud, but constant. A pulse, like pressure in your ears before a storm.

Holden stepped outside and looked up. The sky was full of blinking lights, dozens of them, spread out in a loose formation. They didn’t dive. They didn’t attack. They just hovered, waiting.

People panicked. Phones lit up. Radios went silent. In the towns, folks packed into basements. In the cities, riots kicked off. Nobody fired the first shot this time. The aliens didn’t land.

They just floated there, engines thrumming like an industrial warning. Holden stood in the middle of his dirt lot, shotgun resting in the crook of his arm, and waited. Nothing happened for six hours.

At dawn, a single pod dropped down near a reservoir in New Mexico. It didn’t open. People surrounded it with trucks and flamethrowers. Someone dropped a backhoe on top of it, and when it cracked open, there was nothing inside. Just tools, water, and a machine that looked like a 3D printer. It wasn’t an invasion ship. It was a maintenance drone. A tech repair unit. They had sent down a tool chest.

Holden read about it in a classified memo passed to the comms team on a torn printout. He rubbed his face, stared at the fire barrel burning near the tents, and said nothing. Everyone knew what it meant. The ships weren’t soldiers.

They weren’t even scouts. They were techs, mechanics, maybe explorers. They were here for some reason nobody had bothered to ask before pulling triggers. But the body count was past the point of fixing. There was no going back now.

Still, the ships hovered. Still, no one landed.

Everyone on Earth waited.

The ships didn’t move for three more days. They held position in the sky like statues with engines. No new landings. No lights from inside. No signals that anyone could interpret.

The government pulled together everyone they could find who spoke anything close to interstellar protocol. Experts from NASA, the Pentagon, some think tank in Sweden, even a guy from a UFO podcast. They sat in a tent with too much coffee and too many opinions, arguing over how to interpret silence.

Holden didn’t join those meetings. He had nothing to offer except a shotgun, a burned barn, and thirty-seven confirmed alien body sightings on his land. Instead, he spent most of his time fixing the fence where the heat from the wreck had warped the posts.

His back hurt and his knees cracked, but he worked anyway. The farm had to be cleaned up eventually, whether there were aliens overhead or not. He didn’t want the cattle wandering once he got replacements.

Around noon on the fourth day, one of the smaller ships lowered from the sky and touched down just outside city limits in Amarillo. This time, no fire, no explosion, no crashing through buildings. It landed on the outskirts, in a clear stretch of field, as if it had been waiting for permission. No one fired. People watched it through binoculars, drones, and scopes. Still, nothing came out. It sat there until dusk.

Then, a ramp extended from the side. No soldiers emerged. No weapons. Instead, a panel opened and a crate rolled down the ramp and settled in the dirt. It beeped once. Then silence. That was all. A machine rolled down a ramp, beeped, and stopped moving.

The military sent a robot to investigate. It scanned the crate, cracked it open, and found sealed containers inside. Equipment, medical supplies, and what looked like biological analysis kits. No explosives. No weapons. Just tools.

The general in charge called a meeting and laid the facts out for anyone who wanted to listen. He said the aliens weren’t here to fight. They were responding to some unknown signal, probably a distress beacon triggered by their own ships. He said the ones who came before had landed without protocols because their systems thought Earth was safe.

Nobody cared. In the bars, people drank and joked about alien weaklings who didn’t even shoot back. At churches, people talked about divine protection. On news feeds, headlines kept changing. “Aliens Bring Tools, Not War,” followed by “Government Lies About Threat Level.” Trust had collapsed by then.

Nobody believed anything unless they saw it for themselves. Holden believed the evidence. He believed what he’d seen and shot. But he also believed that once a war starts, it doesn’t matter who was wrong at the beginning.

When the sixth support ship landed outside of Lubbock, someone had already strapped C4 to a grain silo and waited. The second the hatch opened, they detonated it. The shockwave took out two city blocks and killed twenty civilians.

Only one alien had been inside. That footage went viral, and within twelve hours, five other landings were met with armed mobs. People stopped caring about reasons. The aliens were intruders. That was enough.

Holden stood near the wreckage of his own yard and watched one of the smaller ships hover lower than usual. It buzzed just above the tree line like it was scanning. No doors opened. No beams came down. It floated there for an hour, then rose again and joined the others.

He finished hammering the fencepost and walked back to the barn. On the way, he stepped over a melted piece of one of the first ships, black and twisted like metal left in a forge. He didn’t look at it long. He just moved past it.

That night, the sky turned red as three more landings ended in fires. One of the alien crews tried to broadcast a signal. Some translation finally worked, but all it said was “Maintenance in progress. Do not interfere.” Nobody listened. The signal played twice, and then the ship was torn apart by a combine with steel-plated blades driven by a man who lost his brother in the first incident. No one stopped him.

By morning, Holden knew what would come next. You don’t kill twenty, thirty, a hundred of something without a response. Whether they were peaceful or not, someone up there was watching the casualty count rise.

He looked out over the hills and watched a distant fire burn against the horizon. Another town gone. Another group of ships probably circling above trying to figure out why Earth kept killing everything they sent down.

The military began falling back from the rural areas. Too many civilians getting in the way. Too many homegrown militias taking potshots at anything shiny. Holden had seen them up close, pickup trucks with mounted barrels, duct-taped gear, beer coolers, and enough ammo to hold a fortress. They weren’t organized, but they didn’t need to be. They weren’t fighting a war. They were just waiting for more targets.

Holden filled two jugs of water and stored them in the barn, right next to his repaired shotgun and a crowbar. He wasn’t planning to go anywhere. The aliens hadn’t come back to his land, and if they did, he’d deal with them the same as last time. But part of him started thinking about how it all began.

Not from a place of guilt. Just simple math. First contact ended with bullets. Then came explosions. Then came silence. Then came escalation. It followed a line. It had a rhythm.

Late that evening, someone dropped a new message from the aliens into every open frequency. This time, no translator was needed. It was audio, played in multiple languages. “Evacuation requested. Crew retrieval in process. Cease hostilities. Environment not suitable for peaceful contact.” That was it. Four lines, repeated every ten minutes for six hours. People ignored it. Others mocked it. Some believed it was a trick.

The general came back to Holden’s barn the next morning. He wasn’t wearing his jacket this time. Just a plain shirt and boots, dust on his face, and a tired look like he’d been awake for days. He asked Holden what he thought about the new message.

Holden just looked at him and said, “Sounds like they’re giving up.” The general nodded. “Or regrouping.” Holden didn’t answer. He just walked back to the fence, checked the wire, and pulled the slack.

In the last three days, not one ship landed. Not one crate dropped. Not one signal was sent besides the evacuation broadcast. The sky stayed full of ships, but none of them moved. It was like they had frozen in place, watching, recording, judging.

Nobody knew what came next. Holden figured that if they were smart, they’d leave. If they were dumb, they’d try again. Either way, Earth wasn’t changing for them.

That final night, Holden sat on a folding chair next to the barn, beer in hand, staring at the stars. He could still see the faint outline of three ships in the upper atmosphere. They looked closer than they were, just large enough to be visible if you knew where to look.

He didn’t wave at them. He didn’t curse them either. He just sat still, boots planted firm in the dirt, and watched.

Someone nearby fired off a bottle rocket. Maybe celebrating. Maybe testing a launcher. Holden didn’t look. The sound of distant gunfire rolled in from the south. Another town must have spotted something strange.

He leaned back in the chair, stared straight up, and wondered how many of those ships had cameras. Maybe they were broadcasting Earth’s reaction to the rest of their kind. Maybe they were already filing reports back home.

The thought crossed his mind, not bitter, just quiet. What if none of this was meant to happen? What if they really did just land by mistake? What if the whole thing was a tech glitch, and they landed on a planet that responded to confusion with bullets and fire?

Holden didn’t lose sleep over it. He hadn’t asked for visitors. He hadn’t invited them. And once they landed, they made their choices, same as him.

He finished the beer, crushed the can in one hand, and tossed it into a pile of scrap. The barn light flickered once, then went out. Power lines were shaky ever since the last EMP from one of the crash sites. He didn’t bother fixing them. Candles worked fine, and the fridge didn’t have anything left in it anyway. The wind blew dirt across the field. He smelled smoke again, somewhere far off.

He went inside the barn, climbed into the cot set up next to the wall, and pulled a tarp over his legs. The sounds outside were calm. Crickets.

Distant humming from one of the ships still overhead. A single engine passed on the highway. Nothing urgent. No alarms. Just another night on Earth, with the sky still full of things that didn’t belong.

One thought crossed his mind as sleep took over.

We never asked the aliens if they had really come to Earth to fight.

1kyfsy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceClub/comments/1kyfsy2/qa_with_jack/,Q&A with Jack,"Yesterday, there was a Q&A with Jack on tg. He answered some questions from the fan.

1) Q: Hello Jack, First of all I want to Impress your on-going story, what's your favorite route while writing Parallel Universe Bureau?

A: I really enjoy writing them all. You may have noticed each character revolves around a specific theme of duty and loyalty, and getting to explore it from all these different angles is really entertaining to me.
But as for a personal favourite... I very much like writing Orion's older style of speech, with all the fairy wordplay and lies. But my actual favourite is my girl Nettie.

2) Q: JAAAAACK, I love you so much&i like all the secret hints (I mean, I see some allusion on relationships between some characters) in your novells. May be it was written not on purpose, but i really see the tension between Ari, Noah and Dita, and now I see it between Albert and Orion (and, may be, Rowen??). Sooo, it will be great if you give us some scene between them&MC (or just between them 😭).

A: All of your wishes may be answered. And even if they aren't, I'm glad people are enjoying it, because I love writing relationships filled with knots like these.

3) Q: Hello Jack, I wanted to ask, will it be possible to switch from polyamory to a mono branch with a favorite? Or is it confusion until the end 😁

A: The poly routes sadly are not completely fleshed out. I would have loved to do more, but in the end, there just wasn't space to do them justice. It's best to consider them brief flings rather than actual routes.

4) Q: hii!! will it's be possible to keep pixie wings forever if you're romancing oreon? 🥹

A: Yes! Those wings are a part of the MC forever now. She has become something a little more than human.

5) Q: Hello Jack. I wanted to ask, where do you find inspiration when creating your stories and characters? 

A: All over! As I said, the characters in PUB all revolve around specific themes, but inspiration comes from everywhere. You find one little seed and you grow it in whichever direction it needs to grow. I'm sorry I can't give a more specific answer than that. 😅

As for Volume 2, I don't know how much I can say right now, but I do have the idea for Volume 2 completely fleshed out. I think I'm on the fifth version by now!

6) Q: Hello, Jack. Thank you for a branch with Nettie. She’s wonderful. 
6.1) If Nettie didn’t meet Albert, which career she plan to do?
6.2) What does Nettie prefer more; tea or coffee?

A: Thank you very much! I'm so happy people enjoy Nettie and Glim, In particular, I was a little worried that Glim might go too far with her sweetness and be annoying - it's such a delicate balance. Same deal with Nettie's spikiness.

6.1) At the moment she met Albert, she had no plans. The most logical path would be academia, but she would have hated having to interact with people so often. So I think she would have drifted into a more esoteric field - something like translating old texts like our HSR babygirl Lane, or an independent Youtube channel about folklore. Anything where she didn't have to deal with people too much hahaha.

6.2) Coffee, definitely. But when she wants a comforting drink, she'll have some of the good old English Breakfast or some Korean tea that her parents would have had her drinking as a child.

7) He has completed 15 Romance Club stories and currently reading 8. His top 5 stories are Arcanum, Theodora, Vying for Versailles, Dracula, and Time Catcher.

My PCOS has flared up big time after weaning my second baby from breastfeeding.  Weight gain/ insulin resistance being the biggest culprit.  One of the “fun” side effects that has come along with it is this insane amount of bloating (like a puffer fish), constant gassiness, and irregular bowel movements.  

  I am exercising regularly (lots of strength training to help with the IR) and have made big improvements in my diet.  I haven’t eliminated dairy or gluten, as in the past they haven’t given me issues.  I’ve tried various probiotics but they haven’t helped.  I’m trying to drink water but I’ll be honest I don’t guzzle down 80-100oz a day.  Probably more like 60oz.  My diet change has resulted in more fiber as well so I’m not sure why I’m NOT HAVING GOOD POOPS.  Sorry TMI! My morning coffee is *sort of* helping but the best way I can describe is I don’t get it all out… I go but I don’t go to completion.  I’m not left with that “ah, that was nice I feel 5lbs lighter” feeling that I used to. I’m left feeling bloated and puffy and gassy the rest of the day. 

I know one of the symptoms of IR is constipation.  In fact, I read that poor gut health can actually contribute to IR because you’re not eliminating waste efficiently and therefore affecting your entire body’s processes.  I need to get the gut health in check so I can continue to fix my IR. 

PCOS is frustrating.  Also, wanted to add I’m on birth control & Metformin (1500mg).  Thought about stopping BC to help but not willing to risk getting pregnant again.

My husband (30M) and I (26F) have been married for three years but this year has been a ROUGH year, from my version when we have an argument he takes rush decisions right away in the moment of the disagreement, really explosive. (The disagreements are small nothing like a big decision or cheating nothing like that but it turns in crazy decision from him, for example we had an argument about a suitcase on vacation and he left me on the vacation by myself, he literally left the city were we where. That’s how this year started, after that, in every argument his response is just to give up on wathever plan we have, for example, if we have a plan on going to the beach but we had a disagreement in the morning (it can be about something really small like he couldnt find the spoon to make coffee) then the whole plan is cancelled by him right away and won’t talk to me for HOURS. I have talk about this a lot with him, when we are fine together I always tell him that the disagreements doesn’t have to be always the end of every plan, you know?

Well I texted him “Baby really!?” And sent him a pic and he got so upset because I said “Baby really!?” When I saw the keys inside then he said he doesn’t want me on his birthday anymore. Did I actually attack him with thst text? I really didn’t want to fight, I didn’t think this was going to turn into a fight but with him EVERYTHING is so unpredictable. Would you get mad if your spouse texts that to you? If you were him in this case, with my reactions would you have feel bad? Please just want to see if I was the mean one?

There's something I've been wondering about, and Googling didn't really give me a definitive answer. Some of you have been at this for a long time, and some of you work in the business, so perhaps you have more specific insights than I've been able to find.

Why is it recommended to drink so much water while on tirzepatide--other than to prevent constipation. For me, 100 oz. is *a lot*. I live in a dry climate and need to drink water all day, so before starting on this medication, I was drinking 32 oz. of water a day as a minimum, plus a cup of hot herb tea and my morning coffee. In the summer, I drink more if I'm out walking or working in the yard. In general, though, 64 oz. of water is about as much as I can swallow.

My weird body has chronically low blood sodium (I had to take Fludricort for years), so on the days I sweat a lot or drink more than 32 oz. of water, I must add electrolytes. That's fine, I'm used to doing that. Anyway...Why 100 oz. of water (other than to prevent constipation)? I'm peeing my brains out at 64 oz. of water and on the days I do hit 100 oz., I'm up three or four times a night to use the bathroom, which isn't doing my sleep any favors.

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they’d stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.



Naturally, I asked, “*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*”



They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.



They typed:



\> “*Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y — include updated scope and pricing*.”



And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 



They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.



Now?



* You can ask questions inside documents, like “What’s missing here?” 
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates — even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you’re chatting with a teammate
* Turn any AI search result into a full professional document



It’s like **Cursor for documents**. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 



The best part? It’s free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments)

I’ve prepared so much and have the potential to do very well, but tend to lose focus and start making stupid mistakes which cost me marks. 

Sweets, energy drinks, coffee, caffeine pills? Literally anything you’ve found helps? 

Greatly appreciate any response! ",1,1748537174.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

Today was the first weekday in a very very long time that I didn’t log in for a bit of DaD before work while I had my breakfast and coffee.

I wish nothing but the best for this game but it has been very difficult to understand the direction of the game recently. The return to a more hardcore experience and the original vision of the game is one thing but this seems like something else entirely.

A few things seem pretty clear to me:
- there were too many queues
- gear disparity could be an issue at various levels of gameplay
- it is difficult to balance classes in such a way where they can be relevant in trios but not overpowered in solos (or vise versa)
- the game has slowly shifted away from the game the developers wanted to make

I understand the intention of the changes you guys are making and I get it. I do. I want to support you guys making the game you want to make, after all, that’s why I’ve been playing this whole time. I love the game. I still love the game. I played last night with my two friends in squire normals and had a pretty good time. I felt absolutely ridiculous vendoring all the items we found before queueing up for the next game, but I’ll get to that. I still had a good time.

Even when a huge chunk of the player base was complaining about balance and this and that, I’ve still been in the dungeon, having fun. I don’t think you guys always get it perfect, nobody does, but I always loved the soul of the game. I always loved where you guys were going, even if the path you took wasn’t the one I would have taken if I were a developer.

While I understand the removal of solos and duos from a queue management and balance perspective, I think it is an awful choice at this point as you are alienating so many players. I personally don’t care if these modes existed, even though most of my play time in this game is as a solo player. I would be content to play as a solo in trio lobbies. Most people who play solo however, are not. I support the idea of the game being balanced around trio play, and should solo queue never have existed, it wouldn’t bother me. But it HAS existed, and at this point, completely removing it is shooting yourself in the foot. I want this game to succeed, and this is not the way. From where I sit, you need to maintain at least one solo lobby or you will lose too many players. Duos is a bit trickier, and I’m a lot less confident about this one, but one duo queue should probably remain as well.

PvE mode is both a blessing and a curse for the game. It brings a lot of people in and offers a place for newer players to learn the mob AI but it has also come with a lot of challenges in how it has affected the trade economy. My hope is that PvE mode is eventually seen as more of a tutorial mode, or a place to relax and quest with friends or strangers. Being able to use any gear score in PvE mode is great but having substantial rewards in PvE mode is not. Nothing above rare grade loot should drop in PvE mode. Ore nodes should be significantly reduced (in addition to the already reduced number of hits per node). No coin chests, bags, keys, etc should be able to drop in this mode.

Nearly all (if not all) quests should be able to be completed in PvE mode (that means change the requirements for things requiring certain boss drops, rare/legendary gems, etc). Quests are boring and lackluster. People have complained about the nature of the quests for patch after patch. You guys can do better. There are hundreds of great suggestions on reddit, the suggestion threads, and in other games. Tap into these. Use them. Watch the Ryan6DaysAWeek video interviewing DaD streamers – a lot of them had fun ideas about things to add for quests and points of interest.

Quests do not need to be easy. They can and should be really difficult as you progress through the quest chains. Maybe you need to craft some item, douse a skeleton champion in oil, and the champ will then drop a specific item that you can then use to buff Ghost King where you essentially fight a nightmare level Ghost King boss. But please make every single quest completable in PvE mode WHILE abiding by the restrictions listed above. I personally only play PvE mode when I want to let my toddler sit in my lap as he says “I press w” and “get bad guys” - so again, I don’t care about PvE mode, but MANY people do at this point. Give them a space to experience your game. Maybe eventually they will turn into PvP players, but in the meantime, they are still contributing to player numbers and the economy.

Gear gap and queues. Man what a topic. I’m personally a fan of having anything go like it was early on, but I understand I’m in the minority here. It has been pretty clear for a while that a lot of people’s favorite mode is base/squire kit normals. I imagine a lot of these players are more casual and/or come from a battle royal background. Whatever the reason, this mode should always be accessible since it has been so widely popular. Even if it isn’t what I personally would want, or what the current (and past) developer vision is, THIS is what the people have very clearly shown to be their favorite way to play the game. Why would you remove it?

The natural progression from squire/base kit normals would be to then use that gear in a game. But now, they are forced to take that gear into HR if they want to use that gear. (I’m not even going to get into how free to play players aren’t even able to use the gear they find. How they aren’t even getting access to the main game loop that gets someone hooked on this game. This has been a problem in the past and has already been covered by so many. Read those threads, and learn from your mistakes, please.)

HR is a great game mode and there is a lot of fun to be had there, along with great loot, but lets stop pretending that the HR experience is something that every player is interested in having. It just plain isn’t. I play this game an absolute ton, and it isn’t always what I’m interested in playing, but I like using gear I have most of the time. Give us a place to use gear we find that isn’t high roller or PvE mode. This is essential.

Gear gap and random modifiers. Removing random modifiers from gear isn’t it. We need to reduce the gear gap but this isn’t the way. The game just becomes a really shitty battle royal with occasional things you get to bring into the next game without random modifiers. There will never be the dopamine hit of finding a super rare combination of stats if you remove them. It is one of the coolest things about this game and a huge part of the gameplay loop - to remove it would be an absolute disaster.

Modifiers DO currently provide too much power though. Movement speed, all attributes, and flat damage rolls specifically are all way too generically powerful. They all should probably be removed or tuned way back at the very least. Weapons and classes will obviously need to be rebalanced as a result, for example, daggers and rogues would likely need to be buffed because of the reliance on flat damage, fighters might need a slight buff to gap close without movespeed rolls, barbarians might need a slight nerf since they are much less dependant on flat damage rolls compared to other classes, wizards might need a large buff to the base damage of certain spells, etc. The details would have to be worked out over time as the meta develops and we see how things shake out.

I have said this before and I’ll suggest it again, there need to be modifier groups like in path to exile. This give you so much more control over the power of items. If an item can have +3 vigor, +3 agi, +3 str then that is going to benefit druids a lot, right? What if all stats were part of the same mod group, meaning you could only get +3 agi and then you would need to pick up action speed or physical damage bonus or whatever as other desirable rolls. The point is that you need to make a choice about what you are prioritizing, rather than getting to have it all. Builds should be interesting but they should also need to be slightly specialized and have a cost associated with them. When all I’m looking for on every piece of gear is movement speed, flat damage, all attributes, and health rolls then every build just kind of ends up the same. Force us to make choices. Do I want this kit to be low on action speed but hit really hard? Do I want to be really tanky? Etc. Use mod groups, pair up stats to limit generic power, and force us to customize our builds and playstyle in interesting ways.

Mod groups would keep looting still interesting but reduce the gear gap significantly. It also allows for a lot more counterplay, even against geared teams. Is a team running at you at Mach 10? They probably have a ton of AGI rolls on their gear and they are running light armor. You know you won’t be able to run so maybe you try to stand your ground in a doorway instead. Right now, any geared team is not only running at movement cap, but they are also doing a ton of damage, and have a lot of health/tankiness. There are no choices, the choice is to choose everything. Maybe you see a team looking really beefy with lots of plate (fighter, cleric, platelock or something) - you know that if you end up with a fight against them relying on physical damage in close quarters you are probably screwed – BUT you can probably outrun them. You can run and try to take a fight in an open room on your terms. Counterplay is such an important part of itemization and gear gap. We need to have gear matter but not be so generically good that there isn’t counterplay.

There’s so much more to say but this is already way too long winded. I still want the game to succeed. I am not a game of the month player. I like to stick with games for years, and I hope this continues to be one of the games I’m playing 5+ years from now, but right now I’m having a hard time being optimistic.

I’ve been here since PT3 and this is still one of my favorite games ever but I’ve already decided to try out arc raiders when it releases. Until then…

See you all in the dungeon (though probably a lot less frequently).

Was meditating yesterday when it hit me: when do I get to stop becoming and just exist?

Been so focused on self-improvement and reaching my potential. But what if I'm already enough? What if all this becoming is just avoiding being?

Kids don't think about becoming anything. They just are. Fully present. Not worried about optimization.

When did I lose that?

Started noticing moments when I wasn't trying to improve anything. Just sitting with coffee. Walking without a destination. Existing without an agenda.

Felt strange. Like wasting time. But also peaceful.

Maybe the goal isn't becoming the perfect version of myself. Maybe it's stopping the run from who I already am.

Still have goals. But now there's space between doing and being.

Turns out you can work on yourself and accept yourself at the same time.",3,1748536964.0,awakened,3,1.0,False

1kyfhop,https://www.reddit.com/r/b2b_sales/comments/1kyfhop/fair_to_call_it_cursor_for_documents/,Fair to call it Cursor for documents?,"I used to dread writing proposals, contracts, etc. Now I just give specific prompts and my docs write themselves.



A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they’d stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.



Naturally, I asked, “*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*”



They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.



They typed:



\> “*Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y — include updated scope and pricing*.”



And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 



They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.



Now?



* You can ask questions inside documents, like “What’s missing here?” 
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates — even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you’re chatting with a teammate
* Turn any AI search result into a full professional document



It’s like **Cursor for documents**. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 



The best part? It’s free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments) 



While I am using it currently, if you know of any similar AI tools, let me know in the comments.

You believe you're living through an unprecedented era of technological advancement in consciousness research. You think brain-computer interfaces, neural implants, and artificial intelligence represent humanity's bold leap into uncharted territory. You're wrong. What you're witnessing is the completion of a project that began in 1784 when a royal commission in Paris decided that consciousness manipulation was too powerful to leave in the hands of charlatans.

Every breakthrough you celebrate as progress toward human liberation has been another refinement in the machinery of your mental enslavement. The same networks that investigated Franz Anton Mesmer's ""animal magnetism"" have spent 240 years perfecting the art of controlling your awareness while convincing you that you're discovering new frontiers of human potential.

The commissioners who condemned Mesmer weren't debunking his methods.. they were classifying them. What began as one man's transparent manipulation of consciousness through magnetic theatrics has evolved into a vast, invisible apparatus that now operates through your smartphone, your social media feeds, your self-help books, and soon, directly through your neural tissue itself.

You think you're watching the birth of the future. You're actually witnessing the final victory of the past.

1kyfg63,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusparOnline/comments/1kyfg63/breaking_up_with_buspar/,Breaking up with buspar,"I think it’s really important to share positive experiences especially because I was doom scrolling on Reddit  when I first started Buspar and scared myself unnecessarily.

After four weeks of taking 7.5 mg three times a day, I decided Buspar wasn’t right for me. I was originally prescribed it for anxiety and overthinking, but I realized a lot of my anxiety is situational and the side effects weren’t worth it for me. The medicine was definitely working at keeping my mind blank which was wonderful but I kept feeling randomly scared for no reason like legit scared and I couldn’t sleep well at all. So I decided to stop.

This Monday, I dropped down to two doses. On Tuesday, I only took one. Then yesterday, I stopped completely and last night, I had the best sleep I’ve had in weeks and I literally woke up just feeling myself and that was the best feeling in the world. I listened to Headspace’s sleepy music, and it really helped.

Grateful I listened to my body and followed what felt right. But not so worried about rebound anxiety anymore. My magenisum ashwagandha and lthenanine supplements have also been helping. 
I was also finally able to have a cup of coffee after weeks of none 🥹 I’ll be sure to update if anything changes. But I’m feeling positive. The mind is powerful so I just got to believe I’ll be okay. Have a great day everyone. Back to raw dogging life ✌🏼",3,1748536679.0,BusparOnline,1,1.0,False

1kyffpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealPhilosophy/comments/1kyffpf/wrote_something_thats_been_on_my_mind_for_years/,"Wrote something that’s been on my mind for years about what art really is, and how we define it. It started with a conversation during the pandemic and turned into a full-on philosophy rabbit hole. Would love to hear what you think.","It began, as most meaningful questions do, with a casual conversation. One that spiraled into a rabbit hole of logic, philosophy, and meaning. I was walking through downtown Vancouver with two of my closest friends, Mark and Grecco. We were surrounded by the COVID lockdowns, empty intersections, reflections in glass towers, and the quiet rhythm of a city going about its evening. But our minds weren't on the skyline or the city lights. We were focused on a single, simple question. No, it's a deceptively simple question. What is art?
We weren’t trying to impress anyone. No audience, no critics, no need to be right. Just three friends in heated, honest curiosity. Could the process of a window cleaner scrubbing glass with rhythm and care be considered art? What about a fallen tree in the forest? If no one sees it, is it still art? Is it art because of its natural design, or only if someone perceives it that way? And of course, what about the obvious: paintings, sculptures, music? Where’s the line?
We debated fiercely. Walking the streets of Vancouver for over an hour, turning the question around like a Rubik’s Cube, checking it against everything we could think of. And then we ended up at a speakeasy. A horse-betting lounge with a secret password that led us into the back. Now that I mention it, the setting couldn't have been more fitting: hidden truths behind surface layers.
There, under the glow of amber light and with drinks in hand, we finally cracked something open. After dissecting dozens of examples, playing devil’s advocate with each other, and forcing every potential definition to withstand scrutiny, we crafted what we believed might be the most resilient, inclusive, and logical answer we could manage:
Art = Creation + Intentional Observation

We had a breakthrough, and we took pride in it. It felt like the perfect blend of simplicity and depth. Something must be created physically, conceptually, emotionally and someone must intentionally observe it with awareness. Not just see it, but observe it with meaning. It acknowledged both the creator and the observer, the object and the subject, intention and reception. But definitions (especially ones that try to box in something as boundless as art) don’t just live on paper. They live in debate, challenge, time, and reflection. Over the following years, I kept testing that equation. I asked myself, does it pass the laws of logic? Non-contradiction? Check. It doesn’t eat itself. Is it practical? It seemed to apply consistently. Could it include a dancer, a filmmaker, a gardener, a tattoo artist, a chef, even a janitor who organizes tools with obsessive precision and beauty? Yes. But was it too inclusive? If everything could be art, was anything not art? That was the danger. Being so open that the word “art” lost all meaning.
So I kept hammering it. I attacked my definition with every tool I had. I wondered if the term “observation” was too narrow, or too visual. What about music? Texture? Smell? Was “perception” better? Eventually, I landed on that refinement:
Art = Creation + Intentional Perception
It captured the same idea but with more accuracy. Art wasn’t limited to the eyes, it engaged all the senses. A song, a dish, an act of movement. All of it could be perceived intentionally, with awareness and context. But that wasn't the end of the road.
Late one night, I found myself lying on the carpet at my friend Josh’s place. Drinks were poured, the atmosphere quiet (but our conversation loud) and our thoughts deep. I pitched him my long-held equation. We battled it out, poked holes in it, and tried to tear it down. But after hours of honest debate, I convinced him. Not by force, but by walking him through its logic, its scope, and its precision. And for a moment, I felt a strange satisfaction like I’d proven something real, something foundational. Yet, even after that, the questioning didn't end. I kept re-examining my own beliefs, and new thoughts emerged: 
Was there room in this equation for the unknowable? The cultural? The unconscious? Was it missing something sacred, or mysterious, that couldn’t be broken down into logic?
I realized then that the beauty of the definition wasn’t in its finality but in its flexibility. The definition “Art = Creation + Intentional Perception” opened a conversation. It didn’t tell you what art had to be, but it gave you a lens to look through. A framework that acknowledged both the creator’s purpose and the observer’s experience. And maybe that’s the point.
Over time, I realized that trying to define art isn’t really about locking it in a vault. It’s about tracing the perimeter of the fire without extinguishing the flame. You want to contain the chaos just enough to understand it but not so much that you smother it. However, there were valid counterarguments that forced me to keep refining.
Critics might say: “If anything can be art, then nothing is. Your definition is too broad.” And I get that. If I call the pattern of spilled coffee on a napkin ""art,"" am I devaluing the craftsmanship behind a Da Vinci painting?
But my counterargument to the counterargument is this: the napkin only becomes art if it is perceived intentionally. If someone looks at it with the intent to assign meaning, beauty, symbolism, or emotion then it becomes more than just a napkin. It becomes art to them. That doesn’t mean it carries the same cultural weight or mastery as a classic painting. But it means that art is a spectrum. Another challenge: “Where is the skill, the craft, the discipline? Isn’t that what separates art from chaos?”
Absolutely, skill matters. Craftsmanship matters. But those are qualifiers of quality, not of existence. A terrible poem is still a poem. A sloppy painting is still art. Maybe bad art. Maybe lazy art. But art nonetheless because it was created, and is intentionally perceived. That doesn't mean we treat all art equally. But it means we allow it to exist.
Some argued the observer shouldn't matter. If the artist has the intention of creating art, that's enough. But I disagree. If art lives in a vacuum, with no consciousness to perceive it, does it resonate? Does it communicate? Art is a relationship. A bridge between a creation and someone who perceives. That relationship might be intimate or distant, active or passive, but it exists. Without that second half, you're just yelling into the void. And what about natural phenomena? A sunset. A rock formation. A fallen tree. Are those art? By my definition? Not inherently. But they can become art if someone perceives them intentionally. The act of seeing beauty in the mundane, of giving form and meaning to nature, is an act of perception. And perception completes the equation. Over time, I built out a definition with more nuance:
“Art is the manifestation of intention through a medium, perceived with awareness and context.”
 It now requires both the deliberate act of creation or designation by the artist and the engaged perception by the observer together to create its meaning and value.
That refinement added structure – similar to the Oxford definition. It helped answer the big questions. It included sensory perception. It protected against meaninglessness. It emphasized context. It made room for street art, fine art, digital art, performance art, and even living art like architecture or culinary design. And it gave space to honor the observer, without minimizing the artist.
And here’s what I’ve learned through the years:
Trying to define art is less about finding the answer and more about understanding the question. Art is a conversation. A negotiation between what’s created and what’s seen. Between what’s meant and what’s felt. It’s a living thing that changes with culture, with technology, with emotion, with the times.
So maybe this definition isn't final. Maybe it never will be. But it's the closest I've come to something that holds no matter the medium, no matter the moment.
It started with a walk through downtown Vancouver with Mark and Grecco. It evolved in a speakeasy behind a horse betting room. It was sharpened on Josh’s carpet over drinks and introspection. And it continues to evolve. I still don’t know everything. But I know this: It’s not what you’re looking at, it’s how you’re looking. It’s not just what’s mad, it’s what it means.
It's not about being right, it's about being aware. And maybe that’s the most artistic thing about it.

I’ve had vacation, cheat meals, fell off here and there, but always got back on. Now I’m back to tracking my calories and making sure I’m getting cardio. I’ve always weightlifted 4-5 days a week for 45min-1hour long sessions. Now I’m starting to run 1-2 miles after work and after lifting. I’m on my feet ALLLL day at my job, so I get over 10,000 steps every day easy not including my cardio. Here is what I eat everyday, if any advice I’m open to anything. I’m trying to lose just another 25 pounds and I’ll be DONE trying to cut so hard and finally start maintaining the fat loss and start focusing on building more muscle. 

Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs, 2 pieces turkey bacon, 12 oz of coffee with premier protein powder (2 scoops). 

Lunch: 1 cup brown rice, 4oz chicken thighs (got chicken breast ick), baby broccoli, and 8 roasted carrots. 

Dinner: burger bowl with 4oz ground turkey(93/7), iceburg lettuce, half an avocado, and in n out sauce dupe I make with greek yogurt at home. 

Snacks: Banana, grapes, strawberries, quest chips. I’ll do one of these, MAYBE 2 if I’m feeling really hungry. 
I’ll do desert a couple times a week which is a nonfat plain greek yogurt bowl with honey, chia seeds, some granola, and a little strawberry.

I do track calories and most days are maybe a little more than 1,500 cal. I’m in a huge deficit, moving my body. are the cheat meals killing me? do I need to do more cardio? 

sometimes I feel like I’m not meant to be lean, like I’ll be stuck forever. I hate feeling like I am still in a big body when I treat my body so well and I’m generally VERY healthy. FRUSTRATED.

The first week broke me. This week is finally over and I have my first weekend to myself, looking back the week felt like being in a river and paddling with resistance against the waves. Mostly though, I feel really good and satisfied. I have a lot to figure out and sometimes I start to feel my throat is closing up and I’m choking but it’s all in my head. I’m learning to control it and whenever I get a break, I’m calling for God and writing out my worst thoughts on paper. It helps. Work friends help too, one of them leaves next week and I dread the time when my other friend will go on vacation and neither one is here. I can’t imagine the place without them. For now, I will cherish them and I think it’s time I skipped my morning matcha at home and ordered coffee for us because every time they ask me what I want, I tell them I already had my fix. It’s dreadful showing up sleepy and bog-minded. 


Today I diagnosed a child with otitis media, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to distinguish an abnormal ear from a normal one but I did and I’m proud of that. I’m also so thankful that I ordered a high power otoscope because without it, the abnormality wouldn’t have been so obvious. Needless to say, this 7 year old girl walked into the clinic with her dad and she was very cute and I won her over! I think I’m better than I like to admit with children, it’s just that I have to fake interest at first but then we both end up liking each other — well, mostly. 


My patients I discovered, adore me. The older generations always profusely thank me as if I cured the plague when all I did was refill their medications. They tease me when I tell them they should follow up in the chronic disease clinic, they leave my clinic teasing me knowing that they will not be following up any time soon and there’s nothing I can do about it 😆


The young women who come to see me around my age are super sweet and they speak to me in half-english half-arabic and we get each other. They always tell me that I’m so sweet or that I have a really warm face that makes them comfortable enough to open up the way other doctors don’t. Some of them walk in so angry but their anger dissipates immediately when they see me beaming at them with a smile. 


To be honest though, I feel a lot of pressure on me. I worry a lot and doubt my own clinical management, I certainly need to work on being more confident, not in font of my patients but inwards, because I constantly consult other doctors even though I know the correct management. 


One patient really touched me, he was a 19 year old boy who came in with an issue and once I resolved it, him he opened up about another issue. His second issue seemed imminent and raised some alarms in my head and I was quite annoyed because at that point I’d spent a lot of time with him. Of course, it required me to take yet another long history and to consider what kind of labs to order and to manage him accordingly. His friend was bored out of his mind sitting through the consultation with us and it was NOT relaxing for me to think in that state. I sent him to get his heart mapped out by the nurses and I quickly consulted another doctor, who suggested panic attacks. It out he does suffer from them. He’s been suffering from all these vague physical symptoms too and perhaps by visiting the clinic he was hoping someone would pick up on it. He spoke to me about his panic attacks and other things that affect his life and I felt like he really wanted to share more and be listened to. I wish I could’ve given him more than a referral to the mental health clinic but it is all I could do. I crave to have a son to take care of. 


It’s strange and scary how patients trust me with their secrets, their minds, their bodies —not to inflict pain on them, trust me to give them medicine that will not harm them and gladly hand their children over to me, trusting that I will examine them appropriately and give them the treatment they need. It’s too much and a part of me still hasn’t wrapped my head around it all. I am better though and I feel that I am in the right place and if I were to berate myself on one thing, it is that I haven’t continued studying like I said I would. 


Will you pray for me dad? That I am always a safe and knowledgeable doctor who gives her all? That I will always have a kind disposition and that my patients will always feel healed and that they’re not just another number walking in? That I get to continue studying and rising up the ladder? 


I think you would be proud of me and I’d do anything to tell you all the other stories I live on a daily basis, I know you’d love every single one and you’d laugh with me and bring it up even years after it happened. I always mattered to you and you never forgot anything I ever told you. 


The hole in my heart is as big as your absence but I hope it makes you smile real wide that your name gets printed behind my name on every paper that my patients walk in with, and it will continue to be printed as long as I continue practicing medicine. 


I love you so much and I miss you always.
I pray that you’re well and that heaven is waiting for you.

The OP talked about how the Creations site was dominated by paid Creations... and then deleted the post, after getting 17 awards and 797 upvotes. 



The point of THIS post is to empirically prove that the majority of Creations are free.



TL;DR 89% of Creations are free, 11% are paid.

  
Methodology:



When I visit 



[https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?sort=created\_at&page=1](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?sort=created_at&page=1)



I see 20 Creations per page, with 3734 total Creations. There are 186 similar pages. The 187th page has 14.



So, 186\*20 + 14 = 3734.



I took screen captures of every page. 

[Screen capture 1 of 187](https://preview.redd.it/d9msv2rzyq3f1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b76a0194689d99a3000e68cd699bbc591e62b94)

  
I then built a spreadsheet, and listed how many Creations were free (0 credits), 100, 200, etc., up to 1000 credits, for each page.



If any Creations were discounted (I saw two), I used the original price.



There were 411 paid Creations and 3323 free Creations, meaning 11% were paid and 89% were free.



Of the paid Creations:



143 or 3.8% were 100 credits 

74 or 2.0% were 200 credits

101 or 2.7% were 300 credits

38 or 1.0% were 400 credits

33 or 0.9% were 500 credits

14 or 0.4% were 600 credits

3 or 0.1% were 700 credits

2 or 0.1% were 800 credits

0 or 0.0% were 900 credits

3 or 0.1% were 1000 credits



I decided to look for trends, so I batched the results into 4 groups.



The best I could do was 3 groups of 920 and 1 group of 974, due to the way I collected screen captures in groups of 20. The oldest group of Creations has 974.



Here is a chart summarizing the results.



[Comparing 3734 Free and Paid Starfield Creations as of 29 March 2025](https://preview.redd.it/tyle9836zq3f1.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a4ac3d6713eb5e52e111bef234f32f1e19b19d)



It's important to note that the tall blue lines are total free Creations in that group.



The next highest lines, the far right orange lines in each group, are the TOTAL PAID Creations in that group.



The smallest lines, between those two, are all of the individual paid Creations, by price.



The tallest of these is 71 paid Creations in Group 4 for 100 credits.



I also produced this summary table. 



[Summary table for all Starfield Creations](https://preview.redd.it/oii6f7dczq3f1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab442741635aa5608cda09fd8013f0dbc074a0c)



Lines of additional research:



I did NOT try to account for Creations that have both free AND paid versions.



These are often Creations that offer a 100 credit Achievement Friendly version.



I suspect that the large number of 100 credit Creations in Group 4 consists of many of these Achievement Friendly versions.



That would dilute the pool of paid Creations, because there is a free version available.



It is interesting to note the relative decline of free Creations over the four batches and the corresponding increase in paid Creations.



The figures show free Creations declining, 97.1% - 90.0% - 87.6% - 80.8%, while paid Creations are rising, 2.9% - 10.0% - 12.4% - 19.2%.



So, the worst that can be said about paid Creations is that as of the last 920 Creations, they are 19% of all Creations. Again, I believe this is diluted by Creations with both free and paid versions.



At the end of the day, however, 81% is a lot bigger than 19%. 

  
Also, for completeness, at the time of writing there are 10,534 mods on Nexus Mods, and they are all free.",652,1748536380.0,Starfield,129,0.88,False

I’ve '25M' been spending a lot of time with my coworker '24F' over the past month. At first, things seemed warm and friendly — daily hugs, small gestures, caring questions. She’s told me she struggles with opening up to people, suffers from anxiety and possible depression, and feels emotionally exhausted often. Still, she chose to share these things with me.
We’ve spent long hours together — from coffee and cocktails to sunsets, gling to the movies and dinners. She tells me things like “let me know when you get home,” and gives long, warm hugs, resting her head on my shoulder like she’s decompressing. Sometimes she calls me ""honey"", other times “bro,” which has confused me a lot. She even once said, “Next to you and a few like you, I’ll be okay.”
There are days when she actively invites me out, wants to spend time, offers to buy me things, shares her food, and even brings me into her apartment. She’s changed clothes in front of me casually and mentioned she just wanted an excuse to hang out. One time, she told me she wanted to go to the pharmacy, but instead said she just wanted to go with me to get burgers and talk.
And yet, there are moments where she feels distant — not replying to messages for hours or days, canceling plans without telling me, or showing up visibly tired and emotionally drained. Recently, she forgot about a coffee plan we had made, didn’t initiate any hugs (which she usually always does), and seemed disconnected. But then again, the next day she’ll come find me, sit next to me, offer me a cigarette, or say she wants to work the same shift as me.
I'm torn. Part of me feels like there’s something more — emotional closeness, care, and hints of affection. Another part of me feels like I’m in the “friend zone,” especially when she says things like “bro"".
I haven’t told her directly how I feel because I think my actions have already shown it. I don’t want to pressure her, especially if she’s going through something hard mentally or emotionally. I just don’t know where I stand. It hurts not knowing if I should step back or keep being there for her — not out of expectation, but because I genuinely care about her.
Any advice?

1kyf2b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1kyf2b7/suboptimal_darkrai_builds_that_still_really/,Suboptimal Darkrai Builds that Still Really Perform,"I personally like Darkrai and want to use it, even if it is not necessarily the most efficient use of resources. However, I wanted to see what the odds are of me getting a solid Darkrai without completely breaking the bank.



Wall of text incoming!



In defense of Darkrai: It took about two years for them to release the first mythical Pokémon, so even if it takes me about a year to build Darkrai, I feel that it won’t be outclassed for a while. Firstly because even if they do release another mythical in a year, they will probably use the same eureka seed system, which would mean that the mythical wouldn’t be fully built until probably a year after that. even then, Darkrai is probably my favorite mythical except for Mew, so even if another mythical is released, I won’t necessarily prefer it. Secondly, although Darkrai will take a while to be fully built, it will get small power spikes along the way as I level it up and unlock sub skills.



In my opinion, Darkrai’s true power comes from being both a berry specialist and a skill specialist, allowing you to get the utility of two Pokemon in one slot. I wanted to know whether it was viable to use as a splashable generalist on different islands, kind of like a charge specialist but with added berry strength, as raising one just for Snowdrop would be a bit much for me. One caveat to this of course, is that Darkrai is quite difficult to level up, but once you get it up there, the berries will be extremely powerful.

My strategy involves not unlocking any of its ingredients, so that it can have as much inventory as possible for triggering skills. I only use Darkrai overnight and trigger its skill before connecting my pogo plus in the morning. This lets me use its ability without losing any energy. If you do not have a smart watch or a pogo plus, then perhaps a really excellent healer would be able to offset the energy drain. Using it overnight also allows me to use another mythical or legendary during the day if I so choose.

I was disappointed when I got Inventory L from my first roll, but after running some numbers (pics below) it is actually quite useful on Darkrai, almost doubling its inventory and allowing it to bank more triggers overnight.

If you are willing to broaden the sub skills that you would keep to Inventory M, inventory L, HSS, HSM, STS, STM, BFS, and HB, then on your first roll you have a 8/17 (47%) chance of getting something useful, and then slightly decreasing or increasing odds for further rolls, depending on whether you get something you want. (Darkrai has an equal chance of rolling all skills regardless of color).

The logic that I used here is that all of these skills will prove useful, and with the use of one to three subskill seeds depending on how lucky you are (a lot I know, but still less expensive than re-rolling Eureka seeds) can perform quite close to the optimal build.

Note: A subskill seed costs 1400 sleep points, as opposed to one more roll of a eureka seed, which costs a lot more (assuming Darkrai doesn’t crit, the cost that I have calculated for my method of catching is one bonus biscuit, one pokebiscuit and seven great biscuits. The great biscuits cost 2800 sleep points altogether.)



I ran four different Darkrai builds along with a strong ampharos (HSM, STM, Spd up nature) for comparison in raenonx. These are just some examples of skill combinations. I believe that any combination of the skills mentioned above will be quite viable. The website made me choose ingredients for the level 30 and level 60 slots, so I chose coffee, which has the lowest number of ingredients per proc. I imagine that without any ingredients in the level 30 and 60 slots Darkrai’s performance will be better than what is shown. The simulation is run for 24 hours instead of just overnight because I don't have premium, therefore I cannot edit the time range.

Obviously HB is the best roll (even considering that raenonx overrates it in the single Pokémon production comparison), but if you don’t luck out and get HB, the fourth Darkrai in the image, with just Inventory L and HSM performs very well, and already outclasses the ampharos at level 50.

Adding STM results in the 2nd Darkrai, which is about equal in strength to a Darkrai with BFS,HSM, and STM, which is the third one.

Here is another one with only STM and HSM:

I am by no means a raenonx expert, so if you have any suggestions or improvements for my analysis comments would be appreciated.

In conclusion, 25 pips for each Eureka seed is a nightmare, but if you like Darkrai and are willing to commit the resources, the odds are much better than I first thought that you will end up with a very useful Pokémon that can be both a berry Pokémon and a skill Pokémon in one. What do you think? I know that most of this sub thinks that Darkrai is just not worth the resources, which is completely understandable. But as a Darkrai lover, after running the numbers, I feel better about my long-term commitment of raising one.",3,1748535778.0,PokemonSleep,8,1.0,False
