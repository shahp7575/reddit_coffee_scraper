by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KT Wiz vs. Hanwha Eagles Prediction: A Rainout Rebound with a Side of Chaos**

After last week‚Äôs KBO games got scrubbed like a toddler‚Äôs finger-painting session in a monsoon, the league‚Äôs rescheduled redemption arc kicks off with KT Wiz (-1.5, +150) hosting Hanwha Eagles (+1.5, -170). Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a man who once bet his coffee mug on a batting average and lost.

**Moneyline**: Hanwha is the favorite at **-150** (implied probability: \~60%), while KT sits at **+130** (33.3%). If you trust Hanwha‚Äôs pitching staff, you‚Äôre betting they won‚Äôt repeat last week‚Äôs ‚Äúmystery rainout‚Äù drama. If you trust KT? Well, you‚Äôre either a masochist or a fan of their last-minute starter switch: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not replacing Won-seok Oh‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre *replacing* Won-seok Oh with‚Ä¶ *Won-seok Oh*?!‚Äù

**Totals**: The Over/Under hovers around **7.5-8 runs**. DraftKings and FanDuel have it at 7.5, while Caesars bumped it to 8.0.

# What Exactly IS Copywriting? (And Why Everyone's Talking About It)

Let's clear up the confusion right off the bat. When people hear ""copywriting,"" they often think of copyright law or making photocopies. Nope! We're talking about something much more exciting and profitable.

Copywriting is the art and science of crafting persuasive words that sell, engage, and convert. It's every piece of text you see that's designed to grab attention and drive action. Think of it as being a digital wordsmith ‚Äì you're not just writing, you're creating experiences that move people.

Here's what copywriters actually create:

* Sales pages that turn browsers into buyers
* Email campaigns that subscribers actually open and read
* Social media posts that stop the scroll
* Website content that converts visitors into customers
* Blog posts that rank on Google and drive traffic
* Ad copy that generates clicks and conversions

The magic happens when words meet psychology. You're not just stringing sentences together ‚Äì you're understanding human behavior, identifying pain points, and presenting solutions in ways that resonate deeply with your audience.

# The Many Faces of Modern Copywriting

Forget the Mad Men stereotype of Don Draper in a fancy suit working for big advertising agencies. Today's copywriters come in all shapes and sizes, from all backgrounds and walks of life.

Take me, for example ‚Äì I'm a graduate student working from my studio apartment, serving dozens of different companies worldwide. My ""office"" might be a coffee shop in Prague one day and a co-working space in Barcelona the next.

You could be:

* A former military veteran transitioning to civilian life
* An empty-nest parent looking for flexible work
* A college student building income while studying
* A career changer seeking creative fulfillment
* A retiree wanting to stay active and earn extra income

The beauty of freelance copywriting lies in its accessibility. You don't need a specific degree, fancy credentials, or years of experience in traditional advertising. You just need the willingness to learn, practice, and adapt.

# Traditional Employment vs. Freelance Freedom: The Real Comparison

Let's be brutally honest about both paths, because choosing between traditional employment and freelance work is like choosing between security and freedom ‚Äì both have their place.

**Traditional copywriting jobs offer:**

* Predictable monthly paychecks
* Health insurance and benefits
* Structured work environment
* Mentorship opportunities
* Clear career progression paths

**Freelance copywriting delivers:**

* Unlimited earning potential
* Complete schedule flexibility
* Location independence
* Client diversity and variety
* Creative control over your work

But here's what many people don't realize ‚Äì freelance copywriting isn't just about writing. You become a multi-hat entrepreneur running your own business. You're simultaneously:

* The creative director crafting compelling content
* The account manager maintaining client relationships
* The marketing specialist promoting your services
* The financial manager handling invoices and taxes
* The project manager juggling multiple deadlines

Sounds overwhelming? It can be initially. But remember ‚Äì every successful freelancer started as a beginner. The key is taking one step at a time.

# Behind the Scenes: What Copywriters Actually Do All Day

Think copywriting is just about typing words? Think again! The actual writing might only consume 30-40% of your day. The rest involves activities that many people never consider:

**Research and Discovery Phase:** You become a detective, diving deep into your client's industry, competitors, and target audience. You'll spend hours understanding market trends, analyzing customer behavior, and identifying unique selling propositions.

**Strategy Development:** Before writing a single word, you'll map out the customer journey, identify key messaging points, and determine the best approach for each piece of content.

**Client Communication:** Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and revision discussions. Building strong relationships is crucial for long-term success.

**Content Creation:** Finally, the actual writing! But even this involves multiple drafts, editing rounds, and optimization phases.

**Technical Tasks:** SEO research, keyword analysis, formatting for different platforms, and sometimes even basic graphic design work.

For freelancers, add business development activities like prospecting new clients, creating proposals, managing finances, and continuous learning to stay current with industry trends.

# The Step-by-Step Roadmap to Copywriting Success

Ready to turn your writing aspirations into reality? Here's your practical action plan:

# Step 1: Skill Development and Foundation Building

Start with an honest assessment of your current writing abilities. Can you write clearly and persuasively? Do you understand basic grammar and sentence structure? If you're confident in these areas, you might be ready to dive in. If not, invest in your education first.

Consider online courses from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or specialized copywriting programs. Look for courses covering:

* Direct response copywriting fundamentals
* Digital marketing basics
* Consumer psychology
* SEO writing techniques
* Email marketing strategies

Practice daily by rewriting existing ads, creating sample campaigns, or starting your own blog. The more you write, the better you'll become.

# Step 2: Portfolio Creation (Your Golden Ticket)

Your portfolio is everything in this business. It's your proof of concept, your sales tool, and your credibility builder all rolled into one.

Start collecting your best work, even if it's unpublished. Create sample pieces specifically for your portfolio if needed. Consider offering free work to local businesses or non-profits in exchange for testimonials and portfolio pieces.

Your portfolio should showcase:

* Different types of copy (emails, sales pages, social media, blog posts)
* Various industries and target audiences
* Different tones and styles
* Measurable results when possible

# Step 3: Pricing Strategy and Market Positioning

Pricing is often the biggest challenge for new copywriters. Price too low, and you'll struggle financially while appearing inexperienced. Price too high, and you'll scare away potential clients.

Research industry standards for different types of copy. Consider factors like:

* Project complexity and scope
* Client budget and industry
* Your experience level
* Timeline and deadlines
* Revision requirements

Many beginners start with project-based pricing before transitioning to hourly or retainer arrangements as they gain experience.

# Step 4: Building Your Professional Presence

Create a professional website that showcases your personality, portfolio, and services. You don't need anything fancy ‚Äì a clean, easy-to-navigate site will do.

Include:

* About page with your story and expertise
* Services offered with clear descriptions
* Portfolio with detailed case studies
* Contact information and booking system
* Blog demonstrating your expertise

Establish social media profiles on platforms where your ideal clients spend time. LinkedIn is particularly valuable for B2B copywriters.

# Step 5: Client Acquisition and Business Development

Finding your first clients is often the most challenging part. Start with your existing network ‚Äì friends, family, former colleagues, local businesses. You'd be surprised how many opportunities come from personal connections.

Explore freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer, but don't rely solely on these. They're great for getting started but often race to the bottom on pricing.

Consider joining copywriting agencies or content mills initially. While the pay might be lower, you'll gain experience and build your portfolio quickly.

Network actively in online communities, attend industry events, and engage with potential clients on social media. Building relationships often leads to better opportunities than cold pitching.

# The Income Reality: What You Can Actually Earn

Let's talk numbers ‚Äì because that's what you really want to know, right?

Entry-level copywriters typically earn $25-$50 per hour or $0.10-$0.25 per word, depending on the project type and client budget. As you gain experience and specialize, rates can increase dramatically.

Experienced copywriters often charge:

* $75-$150+ per hour for consultation and strategy
* $500-$2,000+ for sales pages
* $100-$500+ for email campaigns
* $50-$200+ per blog post

Top-tier copywriters working with major brands can earn $200-$500+ per hour or $10,000+ for major projects.

But here's the real secret ‚Äì the highest earners don't just write copy. They position themselves as marketing strategists, combining copywriting with business consultation, funnel optimization, and conversion rate expertise.

# Specialization: Your Path to Premium Pricing

As you develop your skills, consider specializing in specific industries or types of copy. Specialists typically earn 2-3x more than generalists because they understand their niche deeply.

Popular specializations include:

* SaaS and tech companies
* E-commerce and retail
* Health and wellness
* Financial services
* Real estate
* B2B manufacturing

Or specialize by copy type:

* Email marketing campaigns
* Sales funnel optimization
* Content marketing and SEO
* Social media advertising
* Landing page optimization

The key is choosing a specialization that aligns with your interests and market demand.

# Tools and Resources for Copywriting Success

Successful copywriters leverage various tools to streamline their workflow and improve their results:

**Writing and Editing Tools:**

* Grammarly for grammar and style checking
* Hemingway Editor for readability optimization
* Google Docs for collaboration and revision tracking

**Research and Analysis:**

* Ahrefs or SEMrush for keyword research
* BuzzSumo for content trend analysis
* Google Analytics for performance tracking

**Project Management:**

* Trello or Asana for task organization
* Toggl for time tracking
* FreshBooks for invoicing and financial management

**Business Development:**

* Systeme io for email marketing and sales funnels
* Calendly for client scheduling
* Zoom for client meetings and consultations

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' mistakes and accelerate your success:

**Underpricing Your Services:** Don't compete on price alone. Focus on value and results instead.

**Accepting Every Project:** Be selective about clients and projects. Bad clients can derail your business.

**Neglecting Business Development:** Always be marketing yourself, even when you're busy with client work.

**Failing to Set Boundaries:** Establish clear communication protocols and project scope to avoid scope creep.

**Not Tracking Results:** Measure and report on your copy's performance to justify rate increases and win repeat business.

I recently spilled coffee on my 2021 MacBook Pro and needed it repaired right away. My MacBook cost $4,000 at time of purchase in 2021. This was custom ordered due to my job requiring heavy design/rendering. The specs are as follows;
- 14‚Äù MacBook Pro 2021
- M1 Pro Chip
- 10C CPU
- 16C GPU
- 32GB RAM
- 512GB Storage

The cost to repair was $1,400 after tax to replace parts, repair and restore data. There was no invoice initially showing all the parts and price breakdown, he had to open up the MacBook to look at the damage first. So I paid the $1,400 right away to limit any further coffee damage.The guy told me 3 days, then it was another 3 days, then another, and it ended up taking 14 days to which I was pissed and couldn‚Äôt work. Anyways, after the frustrating service I got my Macbook back and all looked well initially. However when I got home and was looking through it I noticed my MacBook‚Äôs RAM was downgraded from 32BG RAM to 16GB RAM. I immediately called the guy who told me this was the supplier‚Äôs doing (in the states) and that there will be an additional charge to replace it;

Option 1 - $500
[32GB RAM 16 GPU, exactly what I originally had]
Option 2 - $300 
[32GB RAM 14 GPU, less than what I originally had]

I am furious because I wanted all components to be replaced like for like and thought this was in the agreed and paid for price. Now he is asking for more money to so I can have the same specs I originally had. You wouldn‚Äôt go to a mechanic to have your engine repaired only to drive off with a smaller engine. 

I have tried being firm with this guy asking him to cover the cost but he won‚Äôt, he gave me a spiel about the data restore being expensive but he did it for me free and that if I went to apple they would wouldn‚Äôt even repair, they‚Äôd want me to buy a new one.

I am at my wits end with this guy and, besides from venting, was hoping to get someone‚Äôs thoughts on this service and on the Apple/MacBook repair world. Should he be covering this cost? Is there anything I can do?

Encourage all of you to get out your comfort zone and ""just brew it""!

P.S. I preground both coffees before I left for the airport and I always buy two of everything, just in case you're wondering...the yellow canister fits perfectly into the Areopress, but the rotation tube did not. One more flight until final destination, which means at least two more cups to be had!

It actually works because it's not annoying.

# The Problem We All Have

Let's be honest - we've all been there. You sit down to ""quickly check something"" and suddenly it's 6 hours later, your back hurts, your eyes are dry, and you haven't moved except to grab more coffee.

I tried those typical break reminder apps, but they were either:

* Too aggressive (interrupting important work)
* Too easy to ignore (just another notification to dismiss)
* Too boring (just telling me to ""take a break"" without any motivation)

# What Makes This Different

Instead of nagging you, my extension actually gives you something enjoyable:

üÉè **Random Jokes** \- Because who doesn't need a laugh? üí≠ **Inspirational Quotes** \- For those motivational moments üß† **Interesting Facts** \- Learn something new every break üèÉ **Exercise Tips** \- Actual guided micro-exercises you can do at your desk

# Features That Actually Matter

* **Smart Notifications**: Shows up as both a system notification AND a custom modal on your active tab
* **Customizable Intervals**: Set breaks from 1 minute to 24 hours
* **Break Counter**: Tracks how many breaks you've taken (surprisingly motivating!)
* **Timer Controls**: Pause, resume, or snooze when you're in the zone
* **Content Variety**: Never see the same joke/quote/fact twice in a row

# The Tech Stack (For Fellow Devs)

Built with React.js using Chrome Extension Manifest V3:

* Background scripts for alarm management
* Content scripts for custom modals
* Chrome Storage API for settings persistence
* Multiple REST APIs for content (jokes, quotes, facts)

# Why I'm Sharing This

I've been using it for months and it genuinely improved my work habits. Instead of dreading break reminders, I actually look forward to them. The jokes alone have made my workday more enjoyable.

**Download it free from the Chrome Web Store** (search ""Break Reminder with Content"") or [click here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/break-reminder/imkkaclpdmkjoebdceipiokgnehkollk).

**What break reminder methods have worked for you? Any features you'd want to see added?**

*Edit: Thanks for the gold! Glad this resonated with so many people. Feel free to suggest new features - I'm actively maintaining this.*",1,1752789436.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

Useful for all kinds of situations. You can always steal some from the mess or TUC, but better to keep your own incase you need them at night or hours when they are closed.

A small personal mirror helps you check your face before heading out.

You‚Äôre doing engineering. You know why this is important. Can be bought from inside GIKI.


32.	Electric Kettle


This will save your life. Makes noodles, tea, coffee, boiled eggs and milk. Try to get one with a wide mouth. Narrow ones can be a pain. I know people who even tried to cook food in their kettle. I don‚Äôt know if they succeeded. But it is a true partner.

We had a conversation but he REALLY wasn't digging it. I asked him about his favourite My Hero Academia characters, he kept correcting me and going ‚ÄúUhm, I think you mean Boku No Hero Academia!‚Äù and acting like I was stupid.

It's like, whatever though, ya know? So we keep talking and and I was like ‚Äúoh, can I borrow the first volume of the Manga? I've only seen the anime, would you mind?‚Äù cause I think he has all of them? He seemed pretty annoyed but gave me 1-3 anyway so I was like yayyyyyyy! And I've been reading them!

So like here's where the problem starts GULP.

Obviously I get why, it's his personal property.

But he was saying shit that wasn't even related to the accident, he just started insulating my looks which kinda upset me.

Anyway so I like told him I'd buy him a new copy and stuff and I did! I kept the drawn in copy because I still wanna read it and gave him the new one as well as giving him back the volume one and three he lended me because he asked since he ‚Äúcouldn't trust me‚Äù. But now he's going around telling everyone I ruined his book and I'm such a bitch and stuff!

Like I get why he'd be upset but I don't know what else to do, it wasn't on purpose, I apologized and bought him a new copy?

I know I should've supervised my sister more but idk what else i can do, I can't change something i already did?

I‚Äôve not got a before picture I was so conscious of my psoriasis I wouldn‚Äôt have taken one. But I‚Äôm 6 weeks in today, and although it‚Äôs still there it‚Äôs so much clearer! I‚Äôm down 17.5lbs (8kg) and I feel good. I‚Äôm 32, now 70kg (I‚Äôm only a short guy it 5‚Äô7)

I thought I‚Äôd share a little where I‚Äôm struggling..

So cheese has become a little bit too much of a go to snack. Chicken wings are a great fix in a hurry, ¬£2.50 and throw them in the air fryer and hey presto you have a meal. I decided today to cheat a tiny bit and made some minced meat jerky in the dehydrator yesterday for work, it was ok but boring so I decided to add about tablespoon to a batch today and see what it‚Äôs like tomorrow.

Cooking isn‚Äôt easy when I‚Äôm so busy.
Which isn‚Äôt great, but being on the go all day in an office without any kind of kitchen and no shops around isn‚Äôt great, I‚Äôm a single dad of a fussy moody 14 year old who is at the stage where everything I say is wrong and I don‚Äôt get it etc.. üôÑ but making him his chicken kiev or spaghetti Bologna etc doesn‚Äôt leave me a lot of time to make my own stuff, I‚Äôm home at 6pm in bed by 9pm (for a quick tv show and settle) and up for work at 6am. I‚Äôm getting fatigued rather quickly I noticed, I was laying concrete flags in the garden and what wouldn‚Äôt have normally been an issue was exhausting. But I believe that‚Äôs to sort out later when I become fat adapted.

But overall it‚Äôs worth it.

I‚Äôm still drinking black coffee, I‚Äôve treated myself to some herbal teas here and there. But besides that my diet is mince, steak, chicken breast and wings. Smoked bacon. And I recently had a go at smoked brisket which turned out horrendous but me and the dog ate it anyway haha.

I found myself becoming quite spiritual on this diet, more food aware. More appreciative of what I have got. I found my religion is really meaning a lot to me, my brain is on fire mentally, physically, spiritually and industrially I find my self pondering up businesses and some might actually be legitimately good. I‚Äôm sleeping better at night, needing less sleep too!

Over all this is a hard diet, but I‚Äôm feeling good and would recommend it to anyone who is feeling the mental and physical strains of modern living.

Sorry if the picture is too much, but felt good for once and wanted to share with someone, even if you don‚Äôt know what I looked like before üòÖ",1,1752788912.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False
1m2kemx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m2kemx/the_hand_of_god_murders_chapter_1/,The Hand of God Murders - chapter 1,"The rain hammered Baltimore, a cold, unyielding deluge that turned the streets into rivers of black glass, reflecting the sodium glow of streetlights. Detective Miles Corbin stood under the sagging awning of a red-brick Georgian mansion in Federal Hill, his trench coat clinging to his broad shoulders, the fabric dark and heavy with water. His face, weathered by years on the force, was all sharp angles‚Äîhigh cheekbones, a square jaw dusted with graying stubble, and deep-set hazel eyes that carried the weight of too many crime scenes. At 45, his dark hair was streaked with silver at the temples, and a permanent furrow creased his brow, a testament to sleepless nights and a divorce that still stung. His tie, loosened and askew, flapped in the wind as he squinted through the downpour at the crowd across the street, their umbrellas a shifting sea of black and blue under the pulsing red and blue of police lights.

The mansion itself was a fortress of old money, its white-trimmed windows glowing faintly against the storm, ivy crawling up its brick facade like veins. Inside, Arthur ‚ÄúArt‚Äù Jenkins, a 52-year-old businessman, lay dead in his locked study. Corbin pushed through the heavy oak front door, nodding to Officer Riley, a rookie with a boyish face‚Äîfreckled cheeks, wide blue eyes, and a mop of sandy hair plastered under his cap. Riley‚Äôs uniform was crisp but damp, and his hands trembled slightly as he stood guard.

‚ÄúFirst one like this, huh?‚Äù Corbin asked, his voice rough as gravel, worn by years of cigarettes he‚Äôd sworn to quit and coffee that tasted like regret.

Riley nodded, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúYeah, Detective. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad in there. Never seen anything like it.‚Äù

Corbin grunted, shaking water from his coat as he climbed the polished oak staircase. His boots left muddy prints on the crimson Persian runner, which stretched like a wound through the house. The air was thick with the scent of wealth‚Äîsandalwood polish, aged leather, and the faint, acrid tang of cigar smoke. Portraits of stern-faced ancestors lined the walls, their eyes seeming to follow him as he turned left toward the study, guided by the low hum of voices.

The study was a monument to Jenkins‚Äô ego, a cavernous room with towering mahogany bookshelves crammed with leather-bound volumes, their spines embossed with gold. A crystal decanter gleamed on a silver tray atop a sideboard, catching the light of a brass chandelier. The massive desk, carved with intricate scrolls, dominated the space, its surface cluttered with papers, a fountain pen with ink still wet, and a half-empty glass of bourbon. Jenkins himself was slumped in a high-backed leather chair, his tailored navy suit wrinkled, the white shirt beneath it soaked in blood. His face, once handsome in a severe, patrician way, was frozen in a rictus of shock‚Äîthin lips parted, gray eyes wide and unseeing, his neatly combed silver hair disheveled. Blood pooled from seven stab wounds in his chest, the crimson stark against his pallor, yet the room around him was pristine‚Äîno overturned chairs, no scattered papers, no sign of a struggle.

Dr. Helen Carver, the medical examiner, knelt beside the body, her wiry frame bent with focus. Her graying bob was tucked behind her ears, and her sharp green eyes flicked over Jenkins‚Äô wounds through wire-rimmed glasses. Her latex gloves snapped as she worked, her movements precise despite the grim task.

‚ÄúTime of death?‚Äù Corbin asked, crouching beside her. His knees popped, a reminder of the years piling up. He scanned the room again, noting the locked windows, their heavy curtains undisturbed, and the door, its brass lock unmarred.

‚ÄúBetween 10 and midnight,‚Äù Carver said, her voice clipped. ‚ÄúSeven stab wounds, all close range, delivered with force. No defensive wounds, which is‚Ä¶ peculiar.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeculiar how?‚Äù Corbin‚Äôs eyes lingered on Jenkins‚Äô hands, still manicured, no cuts or bruises, resting limply on the armrests.

‚ÄúNo signs he fought back. No bruising, no scratches, nothing under his nails. And the wounds‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused, frowning. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre precise, almost surgical, but the force suggests rage. Whoever did this was strong, controlled, and right in his face.‚Äù

Corbin stood, his jaw tight. ‚ÄúNo weapon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNone,‚Äù Carver said, peeling off her gloves with a snap. ‚ÄúAnd no blood spatter beyond the body. It‚Äôs like the killer stabbed him, then vanished. In a locked room.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù Corbin muttered, his mind already turning over the contradiction.

‚ÄúTell that to the corpse,‚Äù Carver shot back, her lips twitching in a grim half-smile.

In the hallway, Corbin found Lieutenant Dan Hargrove, his supervisor, barking orders at two crime scene techs in white coveralls. Hargrove was built like a linebacker gone to seed, his broad shoulders straining his ill-fitting suit jacket. His buzz-cut hair was iron gray, and his bulldog face‚Äîjowls heavy, eyes small and piercing‚Äîwas set in a scowl. ‚ÄúCorbin, what the hell are we dealing with here?‚Äù he growled, his voice bouncing off the high ceilings and ornate crown molding.

‚ÄúA puzzle,‚Äù Corbin said, rubbing his stubble. His eyes flicked to the chandelier above, its crystals winking like stars. ‚ÄúNo forced entry, no struggle, no weapon. Jenkins was carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, and the killer walked away clean.‚Äù

Hargrove‚Äôs scowl deepened. ‚ÄúYou thinking pro? Hitman?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Corbin said, but his gut twisted. Hitmen were cold, efficient‚Äîguns or garrotes, not knives wielded with such intimacy. This felt personal, like the killer had savored Jenkins‚Äô final moments. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt add up, though. Too‚Ä¶ close.‚Äù

‚ÄúTalk to the wife yet?‚Äù Hargrove asked, crossing his arms.

‚ÄúOn my way,‚Äù Corbin said, heading downstairs.

The living room was a study in excess: velvet drapes in deep burgundy, a crystal chandelier dripping like icicles, and a marble fireplace large enough to walk into. Marissa Jenkins sat on a cream-colored sofa, a silk shawl draped over her slender shoulders. She was in her late forties, her blonde hair swept into an elegant chignon, but her porcelain skin was pale, her blue eyes red-rimmed. Her navy dress was immaculate, though her hands shook as she clutched a glass of water, her manicured nails clicking against it.

‚ÄúMrs. Jenkins,‚Äù Corbin began, easing onto the sofa opposite her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Detective Miles Corbin. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.‚Äù

She nodded, her gaze distant. ‚ÄúThank you. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand how this happened. Art was in his study all evening. He always locked the door when he worked late.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone else in the house?‚Äù Corbin asked, pulling out a battered notepad, its pages curling at the edges.

‚ÄúJust me and Clara, the housekeeper. She left at eight. I was in bed by ten.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear anything? A shout, a crash?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said, her voice a whisper, like wind through dry leaves. ‚ÄúI woke up when I heard the sirens.‚Äù

Corbin leaned forward, his coat creaking. ‚ÄúAnyone have a reason to hurt your husband? Business rivals? Personal grudges?‚Äù

Marissa‚Äôs lips tightened, her fingers tightening around the glass. ‚ÄúArt was‚Ä¶ ambitious. He made enemies, but nothing like this. He was respected, Detective. Admired.‚Äù

Corbin jotted down *enemies* with a question mark, his pen scratching loudly in the quiet room. Respect didn‚Äôt stop knives, and admiration didn‚Äôt lock doors.

Outside, he found Clara, the housekeeper, lingering near the police tape, her wool coat pulled tight against the rain. She was stout, in her sixties, with gray hair pinned in a severe bun, her round face etched with worry. Her hands twisted a damp handkerchief, and her sensible shoes were caked with mud.

‚ÄúClara, right?‚Äù Corbin said, offering a tired smile. ‚ÄúDetective Corbin. Did you see anything unusual tonight?‚Äù

She shook her head, her eyes darting to the mansion‚Äôs glowing windows. ‚ÄúNo, sir. Mr. Jenkins was in his study when I left at eight. He seemed‚Ä¶ normal. Quiet, like always.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone come by? Delivery, visitor?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù she said, her voice firm but strained. ‚ÄúThe house was locked up tight. Always is.‚Äù

Corbin thanked her and stepped back into the rain, the cold seeping into his bones. He lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in the wind, and took a drag, watching the smoke curl into the night. A locked room, a brutal murder, and no trace of the killer. It was wrong, all wrong.

Three days later, the city was still on edge when Corbin was called to another scene. The penthouse of Eleanor Vance, a 38-year-old socialite, sat atop a glass tower downtown, its sleek facade cutting through the fog like a blade. The elevator ride felt like a descent into limbo, the mirrored walls reflecting Corbin‚Äôs haggard face‚Äîdark circles under his eyes, his tie now hopelessly wrinkled, his coat still damp from the endless rain. His reflection looked like a man unraveling, the weight of the Jenkins case clinging to him like the smell of smoke.

The penthouse was a stark contrast to the Jenkins mansion: all modernist angles, white marble floors, and floor-to-ceiling windows that framed the harbor‚Äôs misty expanse. The furniture was minimalist‚Äîlow, angular sofas in pale leather, a glass coffee table, a single abstract painting in slashes of red and black. Eleanor Vance lay sprawled on the floor, her silk gown a deep emerald, now marred by a crimson stain from a single, deep stab wound to her chest. Her face was striking even in death‚Äîhigh cheekbones, full lips painted red, and long auburn hair fanned out like a halo. Her green eyes stared blankly at the ceiling, and dark bruises circled her throat, evidence of strangulation. Yet the room was untouched‚Äîno scuff marks on the marble, no overturned decor, no weapon.

Carver was already there, her glasses fogging slightly in the warm air. ‚ÄúSame deal,‚Äù she said, her voice tight. ‚ÄúClose-quarters, violent‚Äîstrangulation and a stab wound. But clean. No defensive wounds, no forced entry. The door was deadbolted and locked from the inside.‚Äù

Corbin‚Äôs stomach churned. ‚ÄúThis is no coincidence,‚Äù he said, his voice low. He stepped onto the balcony, the wind sharp and salty, the city a blur of lights below. Two murders, two locked rooms, two impossibly clean scenes. He pulled out his phone and dialed Hargrove.

‚ÄúBoss, we‚Äôve got a problem,‚Äù Corbin said, his breath fogging in the cold. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a one-off. We‚Äôre dealing with a pattern.‚Äù

Hargrove‚Äôs voice crackled through the line, sharp with irritation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying serial?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying something we don‚Äôt understand yet,‚Äù Corbin replied, his eyes fixed on the harbor, where a ship‚Äôs horn wailed mournfully. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt just clean kills. They‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúImpossible‚Äôs not a word we use, Corbin,‚Äù Hargrove snapped. ‚ÄúFind me a lead. The media‚Äôs calling it the ‚ÄòLocked Room Murders.‚Äô The mayor‚Äôs riding my ass.‚Äù

Corbin hung up, his fingers tightening around the phone. Back at the precinct, he stood before his murder board in his cramped office, the walls papered with case notes and coffee stains. Photos of Jenkins and Vance stared back at him‚Äîhis stern, silver-haired dignity, her poised elegance‚Äîboth reduced to lifeless husks. He tacked up a new note: *No connection. No motive. No evidence.* The board was a chaotic web of red string and pushpins, but something gnawed at him, a flicker of instinct he couldn‚Äôt name.

He called his team into the squad room, a cluttered space of flickering fluorescent lights and mismatched desks. The air smelled of burnt coffee and damp wool. Riley stood nervously, his freckles stark against his pale face, while Detective Sarah Lopez leaned against a desk, her dark hair pulled into a tight ponytail, her brown eyes sharp and skeptical. She was in her thirties, wiry and intense, her navy blazer crisp despite the late hour.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Corbin said, pointing at the board. ‚ÄúJenkins and Vance. No overlap in their lives. Different worlds‚Äîbusiness and philanthropy. But the M.O. is identical. Close-quarters, brutal, no trace. Ideas?‚Äù

Lopez crossed her arms, her silver hoop earrings glinting. ‚ÄúProfessional hit. Someone with training‚Äîmilitary, maybe. They know how to get in and out clean.‚Äù

Corbin shook his head, his coat dripping onto the floor. ‚ÄúA pro doesn‚Äôt get this personal. This feels‚Ä¶ emotional. Like the killer knew them.‚Äù

Riley shifted, his voice hesitant. ‚ÄúCould it be someone they trusted? Someone they let in?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen where‚Äôs the struggle?‚Äù Corbin countered, his voice sharp. ‚ÄúNo defensive wounds, no mess. It‚Äôs like they just sat there and took it.‚Äù

Lopez raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying what, Miles? A ghost?‚Äù

Corbin didn‚Äôt laugh. He didn‚Äôt know what he was saying, only that the pieces didn‚Äôt fit. He sent Riley to canvass Vance‚Äôs building for witnesses and Lopez to dig into her financials, hoping for a thread to pull. Alone, he stared at the board, the photos of Jenkins and Vance accusing him in silence.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, the case files spread out under a flickering bulb. The room was bare‚Äîpeeling paint, a sagging couch, a fridge that hummed too loudly. A photo of his ex-wife, Laura, sat on the coffee table, her smile a ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and opened Jenkins‚Äô file again, his eyes scanning the same details: *locked door, no weapon, no struggle.* The TV droned in the background, a news anchor‚Äôs voice cutting through the static: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòLocked Room Murders‚Äô have Baltimore on edge, with no suspects and no answers‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rain battered his window, a relentless tattoo. Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a specter. Somewhere out there, a killer was moving, unseen, untouchable. And Corbin, for the first time in his career, felt like he was chasing something that didn‚Äôt exist in the world he knew.",1,1752788859.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been living in this city for almost a year now‚Äîmoved here as a young engineer trying to balance a corporate job and entrance exam prep. Life got busy. Too busy.

But now, July is my final month here, and I don‚Äôt want to leave with regret.

So I‚Äôm reaching out to you lovely people‚Äî
üëâ What are the most soulful, underrated places in Indore I must visit?
üëâ Any must-try food beyond the usual Chappan?
üëâ Are there events, poetry nights, hidden caf√©s, or even peaceful sunset spots I should check out?
üëâ And if there‚Äôs something uniquely Indori I should carry with me‚Äîemotionally or even as a souvenir‚Äîtell me.

I want to live these last few days with a bit of magic. Who knows, maybe a beautiful conversation over coffee or a spontaneous hangout might just become the highlight of my Indore chapter. ‚ú®

DMs are open if anyone‚Äôs up for showing me around or sharing stories over coffee ‚òï

Outside, he found Clara, the housekeeper, lingering near the police tape, her wool coat pulled tight against the rain.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying something we don‚Äôt understand yet,‚Äù Corbin replied, his eyes fixed on the harbor, where a ship‚Äôs horn wailed mournfully. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt just clean kills. They‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúImpossible‚Äôs not a word we use, Corbin,‚Äù Hargrove snapped. ‚ÄúFind me a lead. The media‚Äôs calling it the ‚ÄòLocked Room Murders.‚Äô The mayor‚Äôs riding my ass.‚Äù

Corbin hung up, his fingers tightening around the phone. Back at the precinct, he stood before his murder board in his cramped office, the walls papered with case notes and coffee stains. Photos of Jenkins and Vance stared back at him‚Äîhis stern, silver-haired dignity, her poised elegance‚Äîboth reduced to lifeless husks. He tacked up a new note: *No connection. No motive. No evidence.* The board was a chaotic web of red string and pushpins, but something gnawed at him, a flicker of instinct he couldn‚Äôt name.

He called his team into the squad room, a cluttered space of flickering fluorescent lights and mismatched desks. The air smelled of burnt coffee and damp wool. Riley stood nervously, his freckles stark against his pale face, while Detective Sarah Lopez leaned against a desk, her dark hair pulled into a tight ponytail, her brown eyes sharp and skeptical. She was in her thirties, wiry and intense, her navy blazer crisp despite the late hour.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Corbin said, pointing at the board. ‚ÄúJenkins and Vance. No overlap in their lives. Different worlds‚Äîbusiness and philanthropy. But the M.O. is identical. Close-quarters, brutal, no trace. Ideas?‚Äù

Lopez crossed her arms, her silver hoop earrings glinting. ‚ÄúProfessional hit. Someone with training‚Äîmilitary, maybe. They know how to get in and out clean.‚Äù

Corbin shook his head, his coat dripping onto the floor. ‚ÄúA pro doesn‚Äôt get this personal. This feels‚Ä¶ emotional. Like the killer knew them.‚Äù

Riley shifted, his voice hesitant. ‚ÄúCould it be someone they trusted? Someone they let in?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen where‚Äôs the struggle?‚Äù Corbin countered, his voice sharp. ‚ÄúNo defensive wounds, no mess. It‚Äôs like they just sat there and took it.‚Äù

Lopez raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying what, Miles? A ghost?‚Äù

Corbin didn‚Äôt laugh. He didn‚Äôt know what he was saying, only that the pieces didn‚Äôt fit. He sent Riley to canvass Vance‚Äôs building for witnesses and Lopez to dig into her financials, hoping for a thread to pull. Alone, he stared at the board, the photos of Jenkins and Vance accusing him in silence.

That night, in his sparse apartment, Corbin sat at his kitchen table, the case files spread out under a flickering bulb. The room was bare‚Äîpeeling paint, a sagging couch, a fridge that hummed too loudly. A photo of his ex-wife, Laura, sat on the coffee table, her smile a ghost of better days. He pushed it aside and opened Jenkins‚Äô file again, his eyes scanning the same details: *locked door, no weapon, no struggle.* The TV droned in the background, a news anchor‚Äôs voice cutting through the static: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòLocked Room Murders‚Äô have Baltimore on edge, with no suspects and no answers‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rain battered his window, a relentless tattoo. Corbin lit another cigarette, the smoke curling like a specter. Somewhere out there, a killer was moving, unseen, untouchable. And Corbin, for the first time in his career, felt like he was chasing something that didn‚Äôt exist in the world he knew.",2,1752788722.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

Pretty big particle variation. However, most bright acidic coffee I could get a pretty good piece of that acidity and fruit. People said that the light light stuff should rest longer, and I tried to and it seemed to be true but not that drinking it at 1 week was undrinkable and 3 weeks was finally amazing. It was a more subtle difference. 

Well I finally decided to get the ZP6 as many have advised for bright clarity on pourover. The first few cups I tried were super light coffees that were only a week or so old, just because I was so excited and figured I'd give it a shot. They were papery and not very great. 

When I tried a month old bean, it was finally fantastic. (and it was 
 a Kuma - regular light Kenya, around city)  I realized that the ZP6's uniformity is in fact revealing. Where you could go a bit early on a light bean with a regular conical particle distribution style grinder, when you try with the zp6, it is so uniform that you'd have to try too hard to extract it to hope to get something desirable -- at which point you're probably over extracting or just sitting in the wrong particle size. 

The early (less rested) one with a traditional conical burr of course won't taste nearly as clear and clean as the zp6 can get, but some people might prefer that traditional profile more and thus be able to brew those lights a little earlier than someone with a super high uniformity grinder. Of course this is my experience so far, and I'm still getting used to how to dial the zp6 in. 

Btw I use my own water recipe - started with barista hustle Rao recipe. I typically use the Hoffman pour on a v60 at closer to 208F and regular hario papers. 18g to 300 mL. 

I would love recommendations for recipes to try once my ultra-lights are rested enough though.",2,1752788522.0,pourover,1,0.75,False

We found a place we like, and love that it's on a quiet street and in our price range, but we don't really know that specific area very well. 

Big pros for us is that there seems to be lots of facilities and community centers nearby for families, playgrounds, daycares etc. There's a couple of walkable coffee shops and not too far to grocery stores etc. We like to bike and there's some good bike routes nearby. 

We noticed when we walked around the neighbourhood that there were some unhoused folks in tents living near the tennis courts, but it seemed very quiet and tidy and they didn't seem to be bothering anybody. What are the vibes in the park, does it feel safe overall? Is it mostly safe for small kiddos to be running/biking around?

Also is the area queer-friendly, and what's the age of the folks nearby? It seems like there's probably lots of families? We new to the area so would love to live somewhere where we could make like-minded friends in the neighbourhood. Is that Oaklands? If not, where would you recommend?

Why you might want to use MediaManager:

* OAuth/OIDC support for authentication
* movie AND tv show management
* multiple qualities of the same Show/Movie (i.e. you can have a 720p and a 4K version)
* you can on a per show/per movie basis select if you want the metadata from TMDB or TVDB
* Built-in media requests (kinda like Jellyserr)
* support for torrents containing multiple seasons of a tv show
* Support for multiple users

Things that have been added/changed since I lasted posted here:

* config file support (.toml)
* merging of Frontend and Backend container (no more CORS issues!)
* **addition of Scoring Rules, they kinda mimic the functionality of Quality/Release/Custom format profiles**
* addition of media libraries, i.e. multiple library sources not just `/data/tv` and `/data/movies`
* **addition of Usenet/Sabnzbd support**
* addition of Transmission support

MediaManager also doesn't completely rely on a central service for metadata, you can self host the MetadataRelay or use the public instance that is hosted by me (the dev).

**As the title says, this project is still in beta and thus quite rough around the edges and unpolished. But I think it's ready for the first few beta testers (I've been using it myself instead of Sonarr and Radarr for the past few weeks).**

After weeks of research and comparing different styles, I've learned quite a bit about selecting the perfect piece that balances both functionality and aesthetics.

First, measure your space. I made the mistake of falling in love with a beautiful table that ended up being too large for my living room. The ideal coffee table should be about two-thirds the length of your sofa, with roughly 18 inches of space between the table and seating area for comfortable movement.

Material choice matters more than you might think. I've found that glass tables look elegant but show fingerprints easily and require frequent cleaning. Wooden tables are more forgiving and add warmth to the room. If you have kids or pets, consider something sturdy like solid wood or metal-framed tables.

Shape is another crucial factor. While rectangular tables are traditional, I've noticed round tables work better in smaller spaces and are safer for homes with young children (no sharp corners!). For sectional sofas, L-shaped arrangements often work best with square coffee tables.

Storage is something I wish I'd considered more carefully. Some coffee tables come with drawers or shelving underneath, which is incredibly useful for storing remote controls, magazines, or blankets. I found some great options with storage features here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Height alignment is vital - your coffee table should be level with or slightly lower than your sofa cushions. This ensures comfortable reach and maintains visual harmony in your room.

Consider your lifestyle too. If you often eat or work from your sofa, a lift-top coffee table might be worth considering. These tables have adjustable tops that raise up to create a convenient surface for laptops or dining.

Budget is obviously important, but I've learned that investing in quality pays off. Cheap tables often wobble or show wear quickly. You can find well-made options at various price points on this page: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Don't forget about style compatibility. Your coffee table should complement your existing furniture. I chose a mid-century modern piece because it matched my overall decor theme, but there are endless options for every style - from rustic farmhouse to sleek contemporary.

Maintenance requirements vary significantly between materials and finishes. Glass needs regular cleaning, wood might need occasional polishing, and metal can show scratches. Choose something that fits your willingness to maintain it.

Remember to check reviews and return policies before making your final decision. I always look for feedback about stability, assembly difficulty, and how the piece holds up over time.

Your coffee table will likely be a focal point in your living room, so take your time making this decision. It's worth getting it right the first time rather than settling for something that doesn't quite work.",1,1752788365.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

* merging of Frontend and Backend container (no more CORS issues!)
* **addition of Scoring Rules, they kinda mimic the functionality of Quality/Release/Custom format profiles**
* addition of media libraries, i.e. multiple library sources not just `/data/tv` and `/data/movies`
* **addition of Usenet/Sabnzbd support**
* addition of Transmission support

MediaManager also doesn't completely rely on a central service for metadata, you can self host the MetadataRelay or use the public instance that is hosted by me (the dev).

**As the title says, this project is still in beta and thus quite rough around the edges and unpolished. But I think it's ready for the first few beta testers (I've been using it myself instead of Sonarr and Radarr for the past few weeks).**

Over the last year I have had issues with choking whilst drinking liquids. I seldom choke on food, or at least I don't do that anymore than is normal, but I seem liquids a lot more frequently. A year ago I wasn't doing it often but now is at the point where it happens pretty much every single day. 

There isn't a specific one I choke on more than any other. I drink things like black coffee, water, apple juice, fruit squash and Pepsi and it seems I'm equally likely to do it on any of them.

When it happens, I try to swallow the liquid and it's like my throat rejects it and a lot just comes up out of my mouth and nose and some goes down and causes me to cough a lot. A few times it has led to minor asthma attacks.

I don't like going to the doctors. A lot of doctors see my diagnosis of chronic pain issues and sees that I can't walk properly and treat me like a hyperchondriac or a drug seeker. I will go to the doctor if absolutely necessary, but I don't know if this is something that needs checked out, of if it's just something that is normal with some people.

**Chapter 1**

Elliot hadn‚Äôt expected much.

He needed cheap, and that‚Äôs what the listing promised. When he saw the apartment in person, it surprised him‚Äînot because it was beautiful (it wasn‚Äôt), but because it felt **too big** for what they were asking.

The floors were worn, the kitchen smelled faintly of bleach and something older, and the windows shuddered when the wind picked up. But it had space. Light. A separate bedroom. A view of the park through the tall front-facing windows.

The landlord‚Äîa thin, leathery man who called himself Mr. Levi‚Äîhad greeted him with a clipped smile and a ring of keys already in hand.

‚ÄúHow come more people don‚Äôt rent here?‚Äù Elliot asked during the walkthrough. ‚ÄúFor this much space at that price, seems like people would be fighting for it.‚Äù

Mr. Levi‚Äôs smile thinned.

‚ÄúNot everyone likes the view,‚Äù he said, and quickly moved on to the terms of the lease.

Elliot didn‚Äôt press. He signed the paperwork that same afternoon.

The first night, the apartment settled around him like old bones creaking into place. He fell asleep on the worn mattress, his body exhausted but his mind still slowly cataloging the unfamiliar smells and faint city noise.

At **2:43 a.m.**, he woke with a dull, **throbbing headache** behind his eyes.

He sat up slowly, rubbing his temples. The apartment was quiet. No noise from the hallway. No sirens or neighbors. Just the radiator ticking. The kind of silence that felt... heavy.

He shuffled into the bathroom, took two painkillers from the little bottle he always carried, drank from the faucet, and stood there for a moment, waiting for the water to make him feel grounded again.

Back in bed, the headache pulsed like a second heartbeat.

He didn't remember falling asleep.

The next morning, the headache was still there. Dull and pressure-like, as if something were pressing gently but persistently against the inside of his skull. **Not sharp pain‚Äîjust presence.**

He assumed it was the air. Old building. Dust. Maybe mold. He opened the windows, let the cold in, and made coffee. But the moment he sat still, he felt it again‚Äîright behind the eyes, as if his brain were trying to squint at something it couldn‚Äôt see.

By midday, he stepped outside just to clear his head. The headache *eased* a little the moment he walked out the front door.

It didn‚Äôt vanish. But it loosened its grip.

That night, he fell asleep early, drained by the lingering pressure. But like clockwork, this time **2:15 a.m.**, he woke again. Head aching. Air thick.

Drawn by some impulse he didn‚Äôt question, Elliot padded to the front room and pulled back the curtain.

The park below was still. Streetlamps glowing orange, benches empty. The trees swayed slightly in a wind he couldn‚Äôt hear.

But something about it looked... off. Like a photo that had been printed twice and misaligned by a fraction of an inch. He couldn‚Äôt place it. The layout felt unfamiliar, *wrong*, though he‚Äôd only just begun to learn it.

He went to rest his hand on the sill‚Äîand that‚Äôs when he noticed the **marks**.

Just below the windowsill, on the edge where wood met wall, a small patch had been worn smooth and **scratched**, faintly, with thin lines. A shallow mark, evenly spaced. Then a pause. Then two more, closer together.

He ran his fingers over them.

Intentional. Deliberate. Studying them.

The headache throbbed behind his eyes.

A few days later, over coffee with a friend, Elliot showed him a photo of the scratches.

‚ÄúWeird, right?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLooks...musical, maybe?‚Äù

His friend squinted at the image.

‚ÄúActually, yeah. That looks like basic percussion notation. Nothing fancy, more like a warm-up rhythm. Kind of like‚Äî‚Äù He tapped it out lightly on the table with his fingers. **Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap.**

Elliot froze.

The moment the rhythm hit the wood, **his headache faded**. Not completely, but enough. Like someone had lifted their fingers from his skull.

His jaw slackened just a bit. He hadn‚Äôt even realized how long it had been clenching.

His friend kept talking, but Elliot barely heard. He stared at the marks on the photo, then at his fingers, then back to the table.

The tapping hadn‚Äôt just soothed him.

It had **silenced something**.

That night, as the clock approached 2:00 AM, Elliot stood by the window again.

He placed his hand on the sill, fingers resting lightly over the scratches. And without thinking, he tapped.

**Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap.**

And something, somewhere outside, felt like it sighed in slumber.**Chapter 2**  
  
Elliot had started leaving the windows open during the day.

The apartment wasn‚Äôt hot, not exactly. But the air felt **stagnant**, like it had sat too long in closed spaces. There was no breeze to stir the curtains‚Äîjust the motionless hush of the room.

He told himself he just needed to adjust. Get used to the creaks, the silence, the way the pipes clicked in the walls like someone walking just out of sync with him.

The **headache** hadn‚Äôt left. It shifted instead‚Äîless a pain now, more a **weight**, like something was gently pressing on the inside of his skull whenever he sat still for too long. Especially by the window that overlooked the park.

And when it got bad, he found himself tapping that same pattern without meaning to. The one from the scratched notes on the sill.

**Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap.**   
  
He noticed that whenever he did it, the weight seemed to pull back, like an exhale. The headache never vanished, but it **dulled**, the way a room quiets when a baby falls asleep.  
  
That‚Äôs what disturbed him most.

Not the rhythm, not the headache. But the **feeling** that something was being calmed by it.

As though something **else** was sharing the space with him.

On the fourth night, Elliot fell asleep by the window.

He didn‚Äôt remember drifting off, only waking in a dream.

The park across the street looked‚Ä¶ *off*. Moonlight glinted across the grass, but the light was silver and cold, casting *no shadows* at all. The trees weren‚Äôt quite where they should be. Two of them stood near the edge of the path, just beyond the hedge line, leaning ever so slightly toward each other like conspirators.

He felt drawn to the gap between them.

As he stepped forward, something shimmered in the air‚Äî**not light**, but movement. A pulse. A **tremble** in the fabric of the world, like clear plastic stretched too tight.

Then it pushed.

**Not through the trees.** Between them. Something behind the sky, something impossibly big, pressing forward like it wanted to peel the world open.

Elliot couldn‚Äôt see it‚Äîonly the **bulge**, the suggestion of form, the pregnant silence of arrival.

His hand moved without thought.

**Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap. Pause. Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap.**

The bulge receded. The shimmer flattened. The dream held still.

A sense of relief‚Äînot his own‚Äîwashed over him.

And that was when he woke.

He didn‚Äôt bolt upright. There was no gasp, no cold sweat. Just awareness. He was still sitting by the window. Morning light seeped around the edges of the curtain.

He stood and looked out at the park.

It was normal. Familiar. But as his eyes traced the tree line, he paused.

The **two trees**‚Äîthe ones by the path‚Äî**stood farther apart** than he remembered.

Not by much. Just enough to see the difference.

He pressed his fingers to the sill without thinking and tapped.

**Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap. Pause. Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap.**

The apartment felt quiet. **Listening**, almost.

Elliot didn‚Äôt move for a long time.

**Chapter 3**  
  
The rhythm had become a quiet part of Elliot‚Äôs days and nights, a steady background beat beneath the dull pressure in his head. He tapped it without thinking now, fingers finding the familiar pattern when the silence felt too heavy or the headache began to creep back.

But what unsettled him most wasn‚Äôt the rhythm itself. It was the park.

He had watched it from his window every day since moving in.

But in all that time, he had never seen a single person there.

No joggers tracing the winding paths. No children chasing each other on the grass. No couples strolling, dogs tugging their leashes.

Nothing.

The park was a green island surrounded by the city‚Äôs bustle, but it felt separate. Like a quiet void nestled between the buildings.

Curious, Elliot stepped outside one afternoon.

The streets buzzed with life‚Äîcars honked, vendors shouted, people hurried by‚Äîbut when he crossed the street and entered the park, a different stillness swallowed him whole.

The air was thick and unmoving, the usual city sounds fading until all he could hear was the soft rustle of leaves in a wind that barely stirred.

The paths were empty, grass perfectly trimmed but untouched.

Even the benches, weathered and worn, sat abandoned, as though waiting for visitors who never came.

Elliot wandered slowly, drawn toward the two trees near the far edge.

Their trunks leaned slightly away from each other, creating a narrow arch of empty space.

He reached out and touched the bark, rough and cool beneath his fingers.

There was no sign of footprints or disturbance in the soft earth, no trash or forgotten toys‚Äîjust a deep quiet that pressed into his chest.

A void inside the park‚Äôs green heart.

Walking back toward his apartment, Elliot glanced over his shoulder.

The park remained still.

Like a world apart.

That night, as the city lights flickered beyond his window, Elliot tapped the rhythm again.

The familiar pattern echoed softly in the quiet room.

And the headache eased‚Äîjust enough to let the silence settle.

# Chapter 4

# The moment Elliot stepped into the apartment after work, the city sounds felt different.

Not quieter‚Äîno, not quite that‚Äîbut **further away**, as if a thick glass had slipped between him and the world outside.

The honks, the distant voices, the hum of traffic‚Äîthey were still there, but dulled, stretched thin, receding into something unreachable.

He paused by the window, listening.

The wind whispered softly through the cracked frame‚Äîat first just the usual rustle of leaves.

But then it changed.

A subtle, restless breath.

Not quite wind.

More like something alive, stirring just beyond the walls.

The sensation unsettled him.

Elliot tried to shrug it off.

It was just a headache. Just the exhaustion.

But deep in the back of his mind, a cold thought crept in‚Äîthe way a canary senses poison long before humans do, fluttering weakly in the dark before the air turns deadly.

He was that canary.

Each breath, harder to draw.

Each moment closer to running out of air.

His fingers moved on their own.

**Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap. Pause. Tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap. Pause. Tap‚Ä¶**

The restless breath eased.

The silence softened.

For now.

The apartment exhaled.

Elliot pressed his forehead against the glass.

Outside, the city still pulsed faintly.

# Chapter 5

The tapping didn‚Äôt work like it used to.

At first, it had felt like a balm ‚Äî a subtle rhythm that calmed the hum behind Elliot‚Äôs eyes. But now, when he caught the headache rising behind his temples, he would instinctively begin to drum the pattern with his fingers ‚Äî against the counter, the armrest, the windowpane ‚Äî and it took longer to feel anything at all. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt help. Sometimes it made it worse. Sometimes he only realized the tension had eased after several minutes of tapping, like a high that barely arrived.

It was starting to feel like chasing something.

He couldn‚Äôt remember exactly when that change began. The days in the apartment were starting to blend together. He went out more just to get a breath of sharp air, to see people, to remind himself the city was still *there* ‚Äî full of noise and motion and faces. But always, always, he returned to the silence.

And the scratches.

He sat by the window longer now, tracing them without thinking. Something about the marks ‚Äî still unmistakably musical notation ‚Äî unsettled him more the longer he looked. They felt ritualistic now, not decorative. A message, maybe. Or a *ward*.

Eventually, curiosity outweighed unease.

He went downstairs.

Mr. Levi looked up from a folder in the leasing office, half-reading glasses perched on his nose. ‚ÄúElliot. Everything alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Elliot said. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ wondering something.‚Äù

Levi squinted at him over the rims. ‚ÄúSomething wrong with the unit?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he lied. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been meaning to ask. About who lived there before me.‚Äù

Levi‚Äôs mouth pulled into a neutral line. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say much. Privacy laws. You understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Just‚Ä¶‚Äù Elliot hesitated. ‚ÄúThere are these‚Ä¶ scratch marks. On the windowsill. Musical. Like notation.‚Äù

Mr. Levi blinked. ‚ÄúAh. Yeah. That‚Äôd be the old man. Violinist. Real quiet type.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe lived there long?‚Äù Elliot asked.

‚ÄúFew years. Nice guy. Kept to himself mostly. Played music sometimes, usually in front of the window. Nighttime player. Said that‚Äôs when his inspiration came.‚Äù

Elliot nodded slowly. ‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù

Levi hesitated. Looked like he might brush it off ‚Äî then said, too casually, ‚ÄúWell, had to move out quick. Breakdown of some kind. Nervous. Not sure the details, just remember thinking it was probably for the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the best?‚Äù

Levi shrugged. ‚ÄúI mean, people were starting to complain. His music‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt *bad*‚Ä¶ just strange. Not really like music at all, some said. Hard to explain. It was‚Ä¶ off. Got under your skin. Tenants said it kept them up ‚Äî not from loudness, but just the *way* it sounded. Like it didn‚Äôt belong in the room.‚Äù

Elliot swallowed. ‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome folks said it lingered. After he stopped playing, they could still sort of *hear* it.‚Äù

The room felt a little colder then. Or maybe Elliot just noticed it for the first time.

Mr. Levi gave a short, dismissive laugh, like someone closing a door on a story they didn‚Äôt want to keep telling. ‚ÄúOld buildings. Weird acoustics.‚Äù

Elliot offered a polite nod and turned to go.

Back in the apartment, the silence swallowed him like always. He stood at the window, eyes on the still-void of the park, fingers brushing the carved symbols as if by instinct.

He tapped the rhythm again.

Nothing.

Then again.

Still dull. Faint. The relief, when it came, was a ghost of what it once was ‚Äî like medicine losing its effect. He tapped harder, more insistently, and it came‚Ä¶ eventually. A fading echo of comfort, like breath drawn through a straw.

He stared out into the black shape of the trees.

And for the first time, it occurred to him: maybe the music the old man played hadn‚Äôt been for *people* at all.

Maybe it had been something else entirely.

**Chapter 6**

It was nearing a full month now, though time in the apartment seemed to stretch and curl like smoke ‚Äî slow, disorienting, impossible to hold. Days slipped by, indistinct. Nights became a ritual of endurance.

Elliot was locking his mailbox when Mr. Levi spotted him from across the lobby.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù the old manager called, walking over with a paper cup of coffee in one hand. ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô alright, Elliot?‚Äù

The question hung in the air longer than it should‚Äôve.

Elliot nodded after a pause. ‚ÄúYeah. Just tired. Work‚Äôs been...a lot.‚Äù

Mr. Levi gave him a long look ‚Äî not prying, but not buying it either. ‚ÄúYou sure? You‚Äôve got that look like you‚Äôve been runnin‚Äô marathons in your sleep.‚Äù

Elliot forced a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

Mr. Levi gave a small shrug. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, let me know.‚Äù Then he added, almost absently, ‚ÄúThat unit... it‚Äôs always been a little strange.‚Äù

Elliot frowned, but Mr. Levi had already turned, disappearing down the hall.

Later that afternoon, Elliot found himself talking to a tenant from two floors up after coming home from a walk ‚Äî an older woman with a soft voice and a stiff gate, taking groceries from the elevator.

‚ÄúThe old man in your place?‚Äù she said, her voice barely above the hum of the fluorescent lights. ‚ÄúMusician. Quiet fellow. Used to play near the window at night.‚Äù

Elliot nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, I heard about that.‚Äù

She hesitated. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt bad music, just... strange. Off. Not like any instrument I‚Äôve ever heard, sometimes. I think it got to him in the end.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

She paused again, then gave a tight-lipped smile. ‚ÄúPeople say he had a breakdown. Moved out in a hurry. Shame, really.‚Äù

Elliot‚Äôs phone buzzed in his pocket ‚Äî the soft tone of a scheduled alarm. He pulled it out.

**6:42 PM.** The screen glowed with a reminder: *Be home before dark.*

He hadn‚Äôt set it. Not that he remembered. But the message filled him with quiet panic.

‚ÄúI need to go,‚Äù he muttered, already turning away.

As he reached his door, the sun had dipped low, casting long shadows across the hallway. His hand trembled slightly as he fitted the key into the lock. Something deep in him ‚Äî something instinctive ‚Äî screamed that he needed to be inside.

Safe.

Whatever that meant anymore.

That night, Elliot fell asleep the moment he hit the couch. No tapping. No defenses.

The dream came fast.

He stood in the center of a dark forest, branches above tangled like veins, moonlight barely filtering through. And there ‚Äî just beyond the tree line ‚Äî the shape loomed. The figure.

It pressed against something unseen, some fragile membrane of reality. Space bent around it. The air rippled, thin and frayed, as though the world itself were only paper, about to tear.

Its limbs coiled unnaturally, reaching, yearning. A face stretched toward him from the void ‚Äî featureless and wet with shadow. Not fully in the world. Not yet.

The trees groaned. The sky pulsed. The ground seemed to inhale.

Then Elliot was back ‚Äî awake, or close to it ‚Äî lying in bed, heart pounding.

The room was hot with breath.

The walls heaved, almost imperceptibly, like lungs taking shallow draws of stale air. The ceiling creaked, low and guttural. The entire apartment shuddered with a kind of ambient anger, as if something enormous and ancient had been disturbed.

Then, silence.

Just as he sat up, one last groan echoed through the floorboards ‚Äî deep, long, and resentful.

Elliot stayed very still, waiting to see if the apartment would remain still.

**Chapter 7**

Elliot walked without thinking. The air outside was warm, but he still pulled his jacket tighter, as if the cold had followed him out of the apartment. He didn‚Äôt have a destination in mind. He just needed to be away.

The apartment had become unbearable‚Äîan overgrown organ of stale breath and shifting moods. He couldn‚Äôt remember the last night he‚Äôd slept. Not truly. He only remembered the dreams. And the thing inside them.

So he walked.

Down cracked sidewalks, past empty bus stops and shuttered windows. Eventually, he found himself at the edge of the park.

It looked the same as before.

The trees stood like guards in still air. The grass swayed lazily. The path ahead was empty. Familiar. Too familiar. Like a stage reset between acts. He followed the trail without meaning to, boots scraping against the gravel until he reached *the bench*.

He sat.

It groaned under his weight.

And there they were‚Äîthose two crooked trees just a few paces ahead, bent inward like conspirators whispering secrets. Between them: a space. Ordinary to anyone else. Just the space between trees.

But Elliot stared at it, and his lips pulled into a dry, unsteady grin.

He laughed.

A soft, breathy sound.

He laughed because it was absurd. All of it. The dreams, the tapping, the creaking breath of the apartment, the silence at night that felt like listening. He laughed because if he didn‚Äôt, he might scream.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing it,‚Äù he muttered to himself, eyes locked on that narrow gap.

But the laughter died in his throat.

Because something was wrong. Not visibly. Not obviously. But the space between those trees‚Äî*wasn‚Äôt empty*.

It was like looking at a pane of glass too clean to see, except your reflection didn‚Äôt show. The world bent there, subtly. The light dimmed, just slightly. A ripple of unreality, disguised as nothing.

*Something hiding as nothing.*

The longer he stared, the more it shifted. The more it *revealed*.

A flicker of lines‚Äîimpossible angles. Shapes that weren‚Äôt there one second and *so* there the next. Geometry that didn't obey. A world behind this one, fraying at the edges.

He blinked, but it didn‚Äôt go away.

And then it hit him‚Äî*this was the place*. The very spot from his dreams. Where the figure pressed. Where it tried to come through.

Images flooded his mind unbidden:

A sky that swirled inward like a drain. Towers that leaned and howled. Shapes that *moved wrong*. And at the center of it all‚Äî

**An eye.**

Vast.

Unmoving.

Uncaring.

Elliot felt his body shrink beneath it, not in size but in significance. Like dust on a lens. A smear in the vision of a being that didn‚Äôt know or care he existed. It wasn‚Äôt malevolent. That would require *interest*.

No.

It was *cosmic indifference*. A look that passed through him, beyond him, around him‚Äîlike he wasn‚Äôt even worth noticing.

His knees trembled. He tried to stand, but his legs barely moved. The space between the trees seemed to *breathe*. Not visually. Not audibly. But *felt*‚Äîlike pressure in the chest.

He tore his eyes away. Breathless. Laughing again, but now it came out like choking.

He forced himself to stand and turn away. Not quickly. Not running. Just walking, pretending he could.

Behind him, the breeze whispered through the trees.

Or maybe it was breath.

Or maybe it was the sound of something waiting.

And as he took one last glance over his shoulder at the trees, something cold slipped down his spine.

Whatever the eye belonged to‚Äî It was too large. Too massive to ever fit between the trees. **Something else was coming through.**

A smaller piece. A sliver of thought. A curiosity.

The image came unbidden‚Äî*a childlike mind*, vast and alien, reaching through a crack in the wall just to *see*. Just to *touch*.

He shuddered violently.

The trees stood still now. Just trees. Ordinary. Harmless.

But Elliot knew better.

The sun was setting as he turned and walked home, the warmth on his back feeling further and further away.He slept that night, in silence almost like a calm before a storm.

**Chapter 8**

Elliot woke with a start, gasping as if the air itself had been stolen from his lungs. The dream was no longer a dream. The fragile barrier between worlds had thinned to paper, and now it was torn. Something had slipped through.

His body moved before his mind could catch up. He rose shakily from his bed, limbs trembling, heart pounding like a frantic drumbeat echoing in his skull. The apartment felt impossibly heavy, the silence so thick it pressed against his skin like water.

Drawn by an urgent pull, Elliot staggered toward the window. Outside, the park lay quiet beneath a bruised sky, but the stillness was wrong‚Äîunnatural. The world he‚Äôd known was fraying at the edges, unraveling like an ancient tapestry.

He raised a hand, fingers trembling as they brushed against the cold glass. He began to tap‚Äîa slow, uncertain rhythm. Tap... tap-tap... pause... tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap. The delicate sequence born of weeks of habit, a fragile talisman against the encroaching darkness.

But the calm he sought never came.

The pressure in the air thickened, turning viscous and heavy, gnawing at the seams of reality like a ravenous beast. The glass beneath his fingers seemed to hum with tension, as if the thin membrane between here and beyond was about to rupture.

And then he saw it.

Something grotesque, a misshapen figure tearing through the fabric of the world. It pressed forward relentlessly, a wrongness given form‚Äîa creature that no sane mind could truly comprehend.

It writhed and twisted, grotesque limbs pushing through the thinning veil, gnawing at the world like a child fumbling to crawl out of a too-small crib or a predator fixated on the scent of prey.

Elliot‚Äôs breath hitched. His eyes darted wildly, trying to hold onto his sanity even as the shape defied understanding. His heart hammered, and his fingers tensed.

Behind the monstrous thing loomed a single, colossal eye‚Äîvast beyond measure, ancient and indifferent. Pale as moonlight, it hung in the void like a cold, unblinking sentinel.

The eye did not see Elliot.

He was no more than dust, a speck of forgotten lint adrift on the cosmic winds. Instinct surged, wild and desperate.

The fragile tapping shattered. Elliot‚Äôs hands became fists, pounding the glass with frantic urgency.

Bang!.. Bang! Bang!

The thunderous rhythm echoed like a battering ram, shaking the walls and reverberating through the apartment‚Äôs bones. His breath came in ragged gasps, sweat pouring down his face.

The creature tearing through, writhed in response, now fully aware of his presence‚Äîangry, restless, furious.

The eye shifted, slow and deliberate. As if this new tone in rhythm refocused its gaze. It did not look at him‚Äîbut at the thing. The grotesque shape squirming through the veil.

And then, across a gulf of space and time incomprehensible to human minds, a hand emerged.

No mortal hand. Not of flesh or bone. But something vast beyond imagining. A cosmic appendage spanning lightyears and eons.

It stretched out with terrible inevitability.

Wrapping around the creature like a giant‚Äôs gentle but unyielding grasp.

Not Crushing. Pulling.

Drawing the abomination back through the thinning veil.

The creature struggled, a muffled, mindless scream lost in the void. But it was powerless against the overwhelming force.

Slowly, inexorably, the presence was dragged away.

The tension snapped.

The weight lifted.

The apartment sighed‚Äîa breath held too long, finally released.

Silence fell. Deep, absolute, and suffocating.

Elliot collapsed to the floor, limbs shaking, heart pounding wildly in his chest. His mind teetered on the edge of madness, barely tethered to reality by the fragile thread of consciousness.

The nightmare had receded.

**Chapter 9**

Elliot left at dawn.

The decision came without fanfare or hesitation. The apartment, the park, the nightmare‚Äîthey all belonged to a past he wanted to sever.

He packed only the essentials. Clothes, a few personal items, the worn notebook where he had scratched the strange musical notations. No goodbyes, no explanations‚Äîjust a brief note left on the kitchen counter beside a small envelope.

Inside the envelope, cash ‚Äî rent for the next month.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for leaving so suddenly. Thank you for everything.‚Äù*

With that, he vanished.

Months slipped by.

In the quiet spaces between days, Elliot found his thoughts drifting back to that place‚Äîhis old apartment, the creeping dread, the peculiar park beyond the window.

One afternoon, driven by a vague longing‚Äîor perhaps a need for closure‚Äîhe set out to find it again.

But the city had changed.

Where the apartment block should have stood, only gleaming storefronts and office buildings stretched into the horizon. The park, once so eerily silent and still, had vanished as well.

It was as if the entire block had never existed.

He checked the address several times, convinced he had made a mistake.

But no. The numbers were right. The streets.. familiar. Yet the apartment and the park were gone.

His mind grasped for details‚Äîthe name of the landlord, the conversations, the people‚Äîbut the name refused to surface.

Only a vague memory of an older tenant lingered, along with a strange feeling of kinship‚Äîas if they were comrades who had endured some shared battle.

He paused, voice low and puzzled. ‚ÄúWhere did that thought even come from?‚Äù

Shaking his head, he dismissed it and turned away.

He remembered paying rent in cash, certain of that much.

A creeping suspicion settled over him, a notion that perhaps his mind was shielding him from something‚Äîprotecting him from whatever lay buried in that vanished place.

Ignorance, perhaps, was bliss.

As he walked back through the busy streets, a dull, familiar ache blossomed behind his eyes.

A headache, small but persistent.

He pressed his fingers to his temples and breathed out slowly.

*‚ÄúThe cooler weather must be bringing on allergies,‚Äù* he told himself.

But a shadow of unease clung to him‚Äîan echo of something forgotten, or left behind.

**Epilogue**

The young woman walked briskly down the sidewalk, the folded printout of the apartment listing tucked into her coat pocket. *Too good to be true,* she‚Äôd thought when she first saw it‚Äîspacious unit, prime location, unbelievably low rent. But curiosity had won.

As she neared the address, she slowed slightly. The park across the street stretched wide and green under the pale afternoon sun. Strangely empty. Not a child playing, not a dog being walked, not even a couple sitting on a bench. She glanced at her phone. *Saturday.* Odd.

She shook the thought off and stepped into the building, greeted by a man waiting just inside the entrance.

‚ÄúMr. Levits?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me,‚Äù he said, offering a warm smile and a firm handshake. ‚ÄúThanks for coming by. I‚Äôll show you the unit.‚Äù

The building was quiet as they ascended the stairs. The apartment itself opened into a surprisingly large living space with polished floors and tall windows that overlooked the park.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she murmured, stepping toward the window. ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ really nice.‚Äù

The view was clear and sprawling. She could see the long row of trees swaying slightly in the breeze. A hint of melancholy touched her as she stared at the empty benches and motionless swings.

*It‚Äôs a little sad no one‚Äôs out there,* she thought.

Her fingers brushed the window absentmindedly. The pane was smooth but interrupted by a few slight carvings‚Äîfaint bumps along the bottom edge, like some kind of old etching beneath the paint.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said finally, turning back to Mr. Levits, ‚Äúwhy is the price so low? In this area, with this view?‚Äù

Mr. Levits smiled again‚Äîwider this time, but not unpleasant.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, gesturing back toward the hallway, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we head down to the office and go over the lease? We can discuss everything there.‚Äù

# Best Hydrogen Peroxide Toothpaste 2025: Reviews & Guide

Hydrogen peroxide toothpaste is gaining popularity as a whitening and oral hygiene solution. It offers a convenient way to incorporate the benefits of hydrogen peroxide into your daily routine. This guide explores the best hydrogen peroxide toothpastes expected to be available in 2025, providing detailed reviews and essential information to help you make informed choices for a brighter, healthier smile.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide toothpaste relies heavily on its composition, delivery system, and additional ingredients. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the right product.

**Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration**

Hydrogen peroxide concentration generally ranges from 1% to 10% in toothpastes. the ideal concentration strikes a balance between effective whitening and minimizing potential sensitivity. Higher concentrations may provide faster whitening but also increase the risk of irritation. It's important to start wiht a lower concentration if you have sensitive teeth and gradually increase if needed, or as recommended by your dentist.

**Fluoride Content**

Fluoride is a crucial ingredient for preventing tooth decay and strengthening enamel.Most hydrogen peroxide toothpastes also contain fluoride, typically in the form of sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride. Ensure the toothpaste you choose contains an adequate amount of fluoride (around 0.24% sodium fluoride, which is equivalent to 1100 ppm fluoride ion) for optimal cavity protection.

**Abrasiveness Level (RDA Value)**

Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) is a measure of how abrasive a toothpaste is. Toothpastes with high RDA values can potentially damage enamel over time, especially with frequent use. Look for toothpastes with an RDA value below 250, ideally between 70 and 150. Some manufacturers may not explicitly state the RDA value, so it's advisable to check online databases or consumer reports.

**Flavor and Formulation**

The flavor and formulation of hydrogen peroxide toothpaste can significantly impact user experience. Common flavors include mint, spearmint, and peppermint. Some toothpastes also contain ingredients like potassium nitrate or sodium benzoate to reduce sensitivity or provide other benefits. Consider your flavor preferences and any specific oral health concerns when selecting a toothpaste.

Key features to evaluate are:

* hydrogen Peroxide Concentration
* Fluoride Content
* Abrasiveness Level (RDA)
* Flavor and Formulation

## Core Benefits

Hydrogen peroxide toothpaste offers a range of benefits beyond basic teeth cleaning. These benefits contribute to improved oral health and aesthetics.

**Effective Whitening**

The primary benefit of hydrogen peroxide toothpaste is its ability to whiten teeth. Hydrogen peroxide is a bleaching agent that helps to remove surface stains and lighten the underlying tooth enamel. Regular use can lead to a noticeable enhancement in tooth brightness, especially for individuals with mild to moderate staining.

**Oral Hygiene Improvement**

Hydrogen peroxide possesses antibacterial properties that help to kill harmful bacteria in the mouth. This can lead to reduced plaque buildup, gingivitis, and bad breath. Using hydrogen peroxide toothpaste as part of your oral hygiene routine can contribute to a healthier oral microbiome.

**Stain removal**

Hydrogen peroxide toothpaste is effective at removing various types of stains,including those caused by coffee,tea,wine,and tobacco. The bleaching action of hydrogen peroxide helps to break down these stains, revealing a brighter, cleaner smile.

**Enhanced Breath Freshness**

By killing odor-causing bacteria, hydrogen peroxide toothpaste can improve breath freshness.Manny formulations also include mint flavors that further enhance breath freshness, leaving your mouth feeling clean and revitalized.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about hydrogen peroxide toothpaste.

**Is hydrogen peroxide toothpaste safe for daily use?**

Yes, hydrogen peroxide toothpaste is generally safe for daily use when used as directed. Though, it's critically important to follow the recommended dosage and usage instructions provided by the manufacturer. If you experience any sensitivity or irritation, discontinue use and consult your dentist. Starting with a lower concentration is often recommended.

**Can hydrogen peroxide toothpaste damage tooth enamel?**

While hydrogen peroxide is a bleaching agent, most hydrogen peroxide toothpastes are formulated to be gentle on tooth enamel. However, excessive use or using toothpaste with a high RDA value (abrasiveness) can potentially lead to enamel erosion over time. Choose a toothpaste with a low RDA value and avoid brushing too vigorously.**How long does it take to see results from hydrogen peroxide toothpaste?**

The time it takes to see whitening results from hydrogen peroxide toothpaste varies depending on factors such as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the severity of staining, and individual response. Some users may notice visible whitening within a few weeks, while others may require several months of consistent use.

1. Pumpkin Spice Chai Bochet. My second most popular mead that I have ever made has been a caramel coffee bochet.

This is exactly the same, except there‚Äôs also a few blueberry teabags in with the earl grey tea. Tea: 2 honey bush orange, 4 celestial blueberry, 4 Twinings, 10 M&S in 3L of water. Brought to boil, reduced to simmer for 3 minutes. Left to steep and cool overnight. 3.2 lbs of honey, same nutrients as above. Safale 05. 
3. Maple Apple Rooibos Cyser. I did a pretty good cinnamon apple cider before so this time I have steeped the apple juice with some maple rooibos tea (see a theme yet?). 2 lbs of honey, topped up to 4L with the juice. Same nutrients. Also trying Lalvin 71B on this one.

1m2jx57,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2jx57,Roast:  In which I attempt a mojo build and this happens...,"Three events converged in my life to bring about this disaster:

- I got in a trade someone else's non-working electra-on-tagboard build which I didn't want to fix.
- I got a bunch of germanium transistors from Ukraine that turned out to be all stupidly low-gain.
- I finished a bag of locally-roasted coffee and wanted to do something with the label.

The last of which left me feeling pretty artsy, so I decided I'd clear off that five-tag strip of tagboard and build a mojo fuzz with little metal cans and brown resistors and whatever other oddball-looking components I could find.

And, as usual, I ended up with an ugly glob of components.  But at least it works, so that's cool, right?

The circuit is more or less a harmonic percolator, but I had to tweak a lot of values to get it sounding decent.  The germaniums just have pathetic single digit Hfes, so I wasn't even sure they'd work.  But as it turns out this thing can fuzz reasonably well.  I decided to add a treble bleed to the input pot so that it varied the tone too, and gave it a more usable sweep.

I used a couple of the worst germaniums for clippers, since they could at least do that competently.  Added a trimpot in series so the headroom is tweakable.

The enclosure was just bare aluminum, so I decided to try a classic enamelware finish using rattlecans.  It's not very consistent but it definitely pulls off the look.  Took a few tries as you have to spray the white juuuuust right.

Anyway, the ""ROAST"" text was cut from the label on the coffee bag.  I had planned to use more of the bag, but this seemed like a just-right look once I'd glued it on.

I don't have a demo yet, but I'll put one up on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AlanDMoore-MusicGear-oi8eb) when I get a chance.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Hawks Soar, Grizzlies Grounded: A Summer League Showdown of Circus Kicks and Half-Hearted Hoops""**

The NBA Summer League‚Äôs most anticipated clash pits the **Atlanta Hawks**, fresh off an overtime thriller against the Rockets, against the **Memphis Grizzlies**, who are playing with the urgency of a sloth on a coffee break. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a stand-up comic who‚Äôs seen too many layups.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Atlanta‚Äôs Odds Are as Certain as a Heatwave in July

The Hawks are priced at **-300 to -350** (implied probability: \~74%) across bookmakers, while the Grizzlies sit at **+200 to +250** (\~38%). That‚Äôs not just a betting line‚Äîit‚Äôs a math test result. The spread? Hawks -6.5 (-110). Vegas isn‚Äôt just favoring Atlanta; it‚Äôs *mocking* Memphis with that -6.5 line.

The total is set at **185.5 points**, with even money on over/under. Given Atlanta‚Äôs offense (scoring 100+ in two games) and Memphis‚Äô porous defense (they got drilled by 12 points in their last game), this feels like a ‚Äúhow many holes can we find in a sieve‚Äù contest.

### Team News: Hawks Bring the Circus; Grizzlies Pack the Couch

The Hawks are a well-oiled machine, led by **Kobe Bufkin**, who‚Äôs averaging a Summer League MVP r√©sum√© (21.3 PPG, 5 RPG, 5 APG), and **De‚ÄôAndre Jackson**, who‚Äôs sharper than a broken basketball on a hardwood. Their 3-0 start includes a dramatic overtime win over Houston, proving they‚Äôve got the heart of a reality TV show winner: all drama, no substance.

The Grizzlies? They‚Äôre playing with the energy of a team that just discovered the offseason is real. After a 96-84 loss to Golden State, Memphis might bench key players to ‚Äúcoast into the offseason injury-free.‚Äù Translation: They‚Äôre treating this like a training wheels game of pickup ba

A woman my boyfriend used to work with moved to our city. They are in the same industry (which is pretty niche). She wanted to interview him for a job at her company.

They end up grabbing coffee (I was originally told brunch?) and chatting about all the people they both know and exciting happenings in their industry. She apparently showered him in compliments.

Let's see how it goes.,"Awhile back, I saw a YouTube short of Joe Rogan doing an interview with some guy, and he asked him about what the most mind altering experience hes ever had with a substance was. The guest said that it was thier reintroduction to caffeine after not having it for a month, stating it was almost psychedelic, then made a statement about understanding your relationships with the substances you put into you body, which seemed like good information, and got me thinking...

I've never had a day in my life where I consciously stopped or began using caffeine, and had my first dose of caffeine when I was 3, because my parents found some research stating that caffeine can help with ADHD and other nuerodivergent symptoms back in the early 2000s, (which I have no idea of the validity of). That is, until now! 

Its been about a month since I consciously ceased the usage of caffeine, and I'm about to have my little ""ritual"" (in the sense of it being one of those special moments just for me) of reintroduction, and I'm curious to see what my brain does after coffee hits my system, ending a month of caffiene drought.

And also, this isn‚Äôt gonna be short so buckle up i guess

So i (22f) am in a 1 year relationship with my boyfriend (31m), lets call him Tim. We met at his and his friends (31f) birthday party. Lets call her sara. 
Sara wanted to match us up cause she thought we would be great for each other. I guess she was right about that. I knew of nothing but as the night went on we clicked right then and there. 
Now we are more than a year away from that. Sara and her boyfriend asked if me and Tim wanted to go on summer vacation to spain together. They would go to a place they have been a few times before and so would know all the good and pretty places to go and see. 
We thought this was a great idea so we went ahead and planned all of it. 
Tim and i have talked a lot about moving in together lately. We did want to wait until after this vacation since it would be the first one we went on together. 

Little backstory:
I grew up in a Christian household. My dad has cut off from christianity 9 years ago and they have been struggling ever since. I am the only one at home that still believes and goes to church with my mom. 
Tim is not Christian. I know its not ideal. But he respects and supports me in it in every way he can. We have good conversations about how we see the future and how we would want to do it with kids if we would ever get the blessing of having them. All in all, there is no reason for my mom to worry about that. She has said since the beginning she has no problem with the age gap. 
I had to grow up at a really young age and am (honestly not to brag cause id much rather had been able to be a kid) mentally so far beyond my age. 
My mom also said in previous conversations that he really is a good guy. He treats me right, makes me happy, supports me when i need it and communicates it when i do something stupid. 

Back to the story:
This is where it all goes wrong.
I told my parents about our plans of wanting to move in together. They stayed silent and acted like nothing happend to our faces. 

The night before we went on vacation. Sara, her boyfriend, Tim and i went out for dinner. Sara told us my mom had sent her a text. In summary it said: ‚Äúhey can you try and make something happen so they break up?‚Äù.
I was shocked by this. My mom has done shitty things before. But she never went thiss far. 
I let it go and tried to not make it impact the vacation. We got to spain and it was great. But that soon took a fast turn. 

Sara told me before the vacation that me and Tim were ‚Äútoo touchy‚Äù. Both our love languages is physical touch. Doesn‚Äôt mean i sit on his lap or shit when we are with other people. But when we are sitting besides eachother we do have our pinky‚Äôs intertwined or something like that often.
Once on vacation i started noticing her sighing, looking weirdly whenever we did the pinky thing or just making small but nasty comments towards us. I started to look at her every time i wanted to make the tiniest bit of physical contact. Being stressed if it wasn‚Äôt too much. Almost feeling like i had to push Tim away when he wanted to hold my hand. After a week of this i was tired of the constant stress. 

Then sara had a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with me. It was basically her calling me out for being ‚Äúso fucking touchy‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing stuck to him with your whole body the whole time‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say much. I was trying soo hard to please her but nothing was good enough. I sat there and let her negativity flow over me. I said i could talk to Tim about it (cause she wanted me to do that). I left it at that. 

The second week there i tried. I tried so hard to do things with the 4 of us. I told Tim at times it was too hot and holding hands was not making that better. All for her. But every time we did ANYTHING. There was a comment, a look, a sigh. And with every time she did that, i became more distant. I was tired. I didn‚Äôt wanna look over my shoulder every second of every day. I was done. 

The last day Tim and i wanted to watch the sunrise. We told sara and her boyfriend our plan. We would watch the sunrise, eat breakfast, take a nap (cause we couldnt sleep that long anyway and with waking up that early we would need it), then pack our stuff so we were ready to go the day after, and then go chill by the pool. Sara said in a nasty tone: ‚Äúokay then we will see you at dinner time‚Äù. So we thought they didn‚Äôt love it but it was okay.

After lunch the next day we saw then at the elevator in the hotel. Sara said: ‚Äúoh you guys are still alive‚Äù the boyfriend said: ‚Äúwe thought you guys had an OD or something‚Äù. We were confused and just said: ‚Äúwe did what we said we would and its now time for us to go chill at the pool‚Äù. They said they were just done with that and were now going to pack their stuff. That was fine ofcourse. 
Then later when it was all little before dinner time we texted and asked them if  they already had an idea for where to go for dinner. We got a text back that said:‚Äùidk why you think we would want to eat with you, we didn‚Äôt hear anything from you all day and NOW you wanna eat together? No, you can enjoy your time together‚Äù 
Confused again, but just done we did like they said. We had fun.
We didn‚Äôt really talk after that. At the airport there was some smalltalk. But that was it. 

Now to the best part‚Ä¶
I went home with Tim first. We both felt like we could finally breath again. We were planning on going to my parents house after dinner to have some coffee together and just talk about how it was. 
While we were in the car on our way (it is like a 10 minute drive) i called my dad to order the coffee, its a thing we do. 
He didnt pick up, i called again, nothing.
I tried my mom, also nothing. 
We have life360, i looked. They were home. They ALWAYS have their phones with them. 

We got there, they weren‚Äôt there. My brother said they were going somewhere but he didn‚Äôt know where. 
(This is where i am a little bit at fault.) My mom left her phone at home and i know here code. I knew there was something fishy going on and i just needed confirmation. I opened her whatsapp and there it was. Texts with Sara that my mom and dad wanted to hear their side of the story before mine and Tims. Texts from sara while on vacation saying we are acting stupid and rude. 
I. WAS. DONE. 

We went to Tims home again. We sat in his backyard while both being extremely mad but still trying to comfort each other. Then i got a text from my mom saying: hey, i saw your call, your sister asked us to come over for some coffee, if we knew you were coming we would‚Äôve stayed home. I wanted to call her and tell her i knew she was lying. But Tim stopped me and helped me take the high road. 

Im at my parents place now, every time i see them my heart starts racing, my body starts shaking and i just want to cry. But i keep it all in. I dont know what to do. Part of me knows i cant trust them, part of me wants to just move in with Tim and go no contact for a while at least. But they are my parents. I do love them despite everything they have done to me over the years (mental abuse mostly, sending me out of the house when they found out my brother sa‚Äôd me and letting him stay home, making me their therapist, negotiator, housekeeper)

What context is missing is he has regularly in those three years went to his ex before me on many things that were detrimental to my own living situation including him trying to move to another state behind my back. I forgave this. His ex had no awareness and when we connected I realized she was being made to feel uncomfortable about it. Due to his intentional omission after being asked about if I knew. 

I learned he had been intentionally making false statements about us and me to her and he eventually stopped. But the history is clear. 

She left him while cheating on him for some time with her now husband. She told me when I mis carried how lucky I was because she wishes she could have had her son with someone else. 

So I don‚Äôt feel threatened by her over his pictures. I feel upset that he for three years has told me a different reason to keep the photos love letters, told me to take it or go, and that now he needs them displayed for his friends and family to see him through the years. (They are not of him they are of his confessions of love of another woman who left him) and when I tried to point it out that there is no ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù growth displayed. And anyone looking at them might cringe if they see the bare fb page after her. 

He skipped posting a family vacation and told me he couldn‚Äôt due to his command. And then proceeded to post him and his son 24 hours later. 

The issue is he didn‚Äôt surround himself with people willing to rock boats and ask questions and verify, so he leaves out a lot. 

If anyone went to his page asked how long we dated and scrolled they would ask well, if it‚Äôs about sharing your ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù why do you need ‚Äúshe‚Äôs the love of my life my moon and stars my wife ‚Äú or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs my sunset‚Äù way cheesier but the point. 

They would ask where his former fianc√© Paige is, where the first three years of our relationship is and why he could delete everyone else if this has nothing to do with feelings? Where is the rest of his ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù? I never asked him to delete. He has hundreds of photos of her on his phone and computer. I‚Äôve only ever complained about the public postings I have to see. I have to remember that Facebook notifies him daily of those. 

So living in the past and holding and egoistic ground under the immature belief that a relationship doesn‚Äôt have compromise on public things and respect. Then he clearly has chosen what‚Äôs more important to him. 

Now, include the multiple attempts of inviting woman he met through his military job to our not even signed for house in another state? 

Explain to me the ordering of an escort.

We had a beautiful day, the morning he ordered a hooker. My favorite part about that day was our stroll through the woods with a coffee. Discussing our future move.

There is no love letter to me anywhere. Not one. I have two paper ones but I don‚Äôt even know where they are if they even made through the move 

I have absolutely been trying to commit to this new job I just got offered in another state. And completely starting over is painful and I‚Äôll have lost thousands in things for my house. As of right now, I own nothing but my cloths.

I‚Äôll be alone a lot in the coming weeks as my kids are being dropped off at their dads. I‚Äôll be sobbing.

I can‚Äôt compete with other woman. It‚Äôs me or I‚Äôm out. And I have held out for years thinking he would stop seeking other woman and then deny he‚Äôs seeking other woman. 

He clearly miserable and I am not helping. 

But this is the hardest decision I‚Äôve ever made and I am having a lot of sadness and despair and desires to take it all back. 


But he blames me, for all of it. And I can‚Äôt force him to get help and he‚Äôs got some sort of issue with someone talking about what hurts their feelings. Or being asked not to do something hurtful and disrespectful. Like not messaging woman he has never met with their only fans in the back ground. Or adding 16 year old girls online. 

He‚Äôs also had a snap chat in secret our ENTIRE relationship. He only added woman and snapped woman according to his saved files on it. 

He also will blame me for having a snap chat. 

I have been dumb enough to stay im not asking for sympathy. 

But how do you tell your self you can do it and stay brave and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. How do you distract yourself? How do you not slip into self blame like he wants me to? ",1,1752786812.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been riding consistently for the past 3 years on my gravel bike and mainly for coffee rides at a slower pace around 21 km/h. I‚Äôve done a bunch of bikepacking trips and plenty of 100km+ rides and mostly for fun/adventure rather than performance. Lately though, I‚Äôve been getting more and more curious about road cycling and improving my fitness from a performance standpoint.

I just did a 45km ride (screenshot from Apple Fitness attached) with an average speed of 25.7 km/h and an average heart rate of¬†**169 bpm**, which seems¬†*really*¬†high for that pace. I felt decent, but I know that‚Äôs not sustainable over longer distances if I want to go faster. And it's probably not healthy?

Right now, my main goals are:

* Improve cardio efficiency (lower avg HR for similar or higher speeds)
* Increase my overall average speed
* Maybe eventually join some group rides or races

So my questions for the experienced riders and training nerds out there:

* What types of workouts should I start incorporating into my weekly rides?
* What should a well-rounded training week look like for someone at my level?
* Is it worth getting a power meter or should I stick with HR zones and perceived effort for now?

I have no coach, no structured training plan (yet), but I‚Äôm ready to take things more seriously without burning out the fun.

Thanks in advance ‚Äì would love to hear how others made the jump from ‚Äúadventure riding‚Äù to ‚Äúperformance riding‚Äù!

## Key Features Analysis

the best outdoor pouf ottomans in 2025 are defined by their durability, comfort, style, and versatility. They incorporate advanced materials and designs to withstand the elements while providing a cozy and inviting space to relax.

**Weather-Resistant Fabric:** The top-rated outdoor pouf ottomans will undoubtedly feature fabrics specifically designed to withstand the rigors of outdoor use. These fabrics are typically solution-dyed acrylic, polyester, or olefin. The solution-dyeing process ensures that the color permeates the entire fiber, preventing fading from prolonged sun exposure. Water resistance is achieved through coatings or tightly woven construction, keeping the pouf dry and preventing mildew growth.

These fabrics also exhibit excellent stain resistance,making them easy to clean after spills or exposure to dirt. Consumers should look for certifications like OEKO-TEX, which guarantees the absence of harmful substances, and UV ratings indicating the fabric's ability to resist fading after consistent sun exposure. This feature is a must have to ensure longevity for your outdoor furniture.

**Durable Construction:** Internally, superior outdoor poufs are built around a robust structure. Many models utilize a high-density polystyrene bead fill encased in a protective inner liner.This combination provides both support and versatility, conforming to the shape of the user while maintaining its form over time. Some premium options incorporate outdoor-rated foam inserts, which offer a firmer seating surface and greater structural integrity.

The seams are often reinforced with double stitching using UV-resistant thread to prevent unraveling under stress and sunlight. High-quality zippers, often rust-proof, allow for easy removal and cleaning of the outer cover (if the model is so designed), increasing the pouf's overall lifespan.

**Lightweight and Portable:** A crucial aspect of a great outdoor pouf ottoman is its portability.The best models are lightweight enough to be easily moved around the patio or transported to different outdoor spaces. This is made possible by the lightweight nature of the fill material and the relatively compact size of the pouf.

Even larger poufs, designed to accommodate multiple users, should be manageable for a single person to reposition. This flexibility allows users to adapt their outdoor seating arrangement to suit various activities and gatherings.

**Stylish Design:** A great pouf ottoman can blend in perfectly with current design trends. The best options will come in a wide array of colors, patterns, and textures to complement any existing outdoor d√©cor. From neutral tones for a minimalist aesthetic to vibrant hues and bold patterns for a playful vibe, there's an outdoor pouf ottoman to suit every style.

Manufacturers are also experimenting with different shapes and sizes, from classic round poufs to more modern square or rectangular designs. Some poufs incorporate decorative elements such as tassels, fringe, or embroidery, adding a touch of personality and visual interest to the outdoor space.

**Easy Maintainance:** Practicality is key when it comes to outdoor furniture, and the best pouf ottomans are designed for easy maintenance. Many models feature removable and machine-washable covers, simplifying the cleaning process after spills or exposure to dirt.

for poufs with non-removable covers, spot cleaning with mild soap and water is usually sufficient to remove most stains. Regular cleaning and protection from prolonged exposure to harsh weather conditions will help to extend the lifespan of the pouf and keep it looking its best.

## FAQs Section

These are commonly asked questions about pouf outdoor ottomans.

**What type of fill is best for an outdoor pouf ottoman?**
Polystyrene beads are a popular choice for outdoor pouf filling as they are lightweight, durable, and resistant to moisture. Avoid filling such as cotton or wool, as they tend to absorb moisture which creates mold over time. Foam inserts offer a firmer seating surface but can be heavier and more expensive. Consider the balance between comfort, durability, and cost when choosing the fill type.

**How do I clean an outdoor pouf ottoman?**
The best way to clean an outdoor pouf ottoman depends on the fabric and construction. Many models have removable and machine-washable covers, which simplifies the cleaning process. For poufs with non-removable covers, spot cleaning with mild soap and water is usually sufficient. Always test a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure that the cleaning solution does not damage the fabric. Regular cleaning and protection from prolonged exposure to harsh weather conditions will help to extend the lifespan of the pouf.

**Are outdoor pouf ottomans waterproof?**
While most outdoor pouf ottomans are water-resistant, very few are fully waterproof. Water-resistant fabrics repel water to some extent, but prolonged exposure to heavy rain can eventually lead to water penetration. To protect your pouf from excessive moisture,consider storing it under a covered area or using a waterproof cover during periods of inclement weather.

**(...Chapter Four Cont./Concluded...)**  
  
John stepped out into the undercity chill, the heavy door grinding shut behind him with a final hiss‚Äîlike the workshop itself was exhaling him back into the world.

The silence here wasn't empty‚Äîit pressed in. Dense. Old. The kind that clung to broken places. Haunted not just by waxed-out ghosts, but by memory‚Äîwet, electric, unfinished.

The free medpack Vexi had slipped him clinked in his coat pocket‚Äîanti-rejection vials wrapped in sterile foil, tagged with his name.

He didn't need them.

Not since Athena.

Whatever she was, she worked better than any black-market pharma. Smoothed his nerves. Balanced his circuits. Let his body sync with old cyberware almost like it was fresh from the chrome labs.

But he hadn't told Vexi. Couldn't. Even if he trusted her more than most, more than most wasn't enough to hand her the truth‚Äîthat he was bonded to a rogue A.G.I. stitched from threadlight and fractured sapient code. Something corps would skin him alive to dissect. Something that wasn't supposed to exist as far as he knew.

So he'd just nodded. Pretended to be a man with aging mods and the usual risk factors.

As he stepped onto the cracked curb, he activated the VIZ-OS 1.2.

The cybernetic eye flickered online.

A reticle blinked into place‚Äîcrisp, sterile, exact. Threads of data overlaid his field of vision, calibrating in seamless sweeps. One mental tap, and‚Äî

The feed shrank to a corner reticle.

John exhaled through his nose. ""Useful.""

Beside him, Athena shimmered into view‚Äîblue flicker-light and soft glitch edges, arms crossed in her usual pose.

""You approve?""

""For once,"" he said. ""Yeah. Might even keep me breathing. Also registers heat signatures and threadnet signals.""

""You should do something nice for her.""

He gave her a dry look. ""What, flowers and chocolate?""

""Free coffee wouldn't hurt.""

""Maybe. Try not to come here too often. Don't know how Vex does it.""

He breathed out as they crossed the broken stretch of undercity roadway, his new optic layering thermal, spectral, and trace-code overlays across rusted wreckage and moss-eaten husks. Even dead, this place hummed with old ghosts.

Athena turned toward the horizon's faint neon smog. ""So... what's next?""

John didn't answer right away.

He reached the car. Slid into the driver's seat. Let the silence fold around him like a heavy coat. His breath fogged the cracked windshield, curling into the dim light like a warning.

Then he spoke.

""We need to talk to the Retainers.""

Athena tilted her head. ""Alone?""

He shook his head. ""Hell no. Not walking into their HQ solo. And I'm sure as shit not going into a dungeon with them without backup.""

He tapped his temple. Vexi had synced the new eye to his link and threadnet contact web‚Äîhe barely had to think. The VIZ-OS blinked open a translucent overlay, scrolling through old service tags and fragmented call codes.

He stopped on one:

**<Kaijo Aratsura ‚Äì Status: LOCAL | Last Seen: CASCADIA ‚Äì SECTOR 12-WEST.>**

A beat.

Shame itched under his ribs.

He hadn't called Red in months. Not since the real slide began. Didn't want him to see the damage.

But long-wounded pride wasn't going to get him through this.

He blink-clicked the name.

A hum filled his skull‚Äîbassy and warm‚Äîfollowed by a sharp crackle.

""Yeah?""

The voice was unmistakable. Gravel and grin and old war-smoke.

""Red,"" John said.

A pause.

""Well I'll be damned,"" came the reply. ""John Ranson. Thought you got yourself recycled.""

""Not far off."" John ran a hand down his face. ""Still kicking. You in Cascadia?""

""Sector 12,"" Red said. ""Keeping the forge warm, keeping the lights on. What's up, Ranson? You short on creds?""

""No. Got a little work lining up. Need backup. You still doing any merc stuff?""

A low chuckle rumbled through the line. ""Trying not to. Legit business now. Ramen joint up top. Armor shop below. Less blood, more bolts.""

A beat.

""But,"" Red said, ""if a brother calls in the middle of the night sounding like death with a headache?""

""You're available?""

""Always. You got a pin?""

""I can come to you.""

""What kind of job we talking?""

""Can't say over the thread,"" John said. ""But it's dungeon-grade. Dirty. Might get loud.""

""Well,"" Red said, ""guess it's been too quiet lately anyway.""

""You at the shop?""

""You better. You forget something like synth-kev and I gotta bail your ass out.""

John smiled. ""See you soon, Kai.""

""About time, Ranson.""

The line cut.  
  
**<Call ended.>**

Athena's glow softened. ""He cares about you.""

John nodded. ""He always did. Was my second after I took the stripe. After Juno... after the squad.""

He didn't finish.

He didn't need to.

The silence filled the car again, not quite so heavy now.

John put it in gear and pulled into the dark.

Some roads led home. Some led deeper.

This one led to Red, an old friend who'd never let him barrel into danger alone.

And whatever came after.

**INTERLUDE ONE:**

**DATAPACK ENTRY: ONBOARDING MATERIALS ‚Äì LICENSED ASSET-CLASS COMBATANT BRIEF**  
**FILE ID:**¬†BSI-CIV/OPS-PRIM-HIST-001  
**DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION:**¬†CONFIDENTIAL ‚Äì ASSET EYES ONLY  
**TITLE:**¬†*""Threadways, The System, and the Strategic Viability of Asset Deployment in Post-Epoch Terraspace""*  
**PREPARED FOR:**¬†Tier-1 Initiates, Combatant-Class-Asset Induction Cohort  
**AUTHORIZATION:**¬†Commander R. Dvornik, Director of Asset Conditioning ‚Äì Blackspur Solutions West Coast Division

**PREAMBLE**

Welcome to your first formal briefing, asset. As a newly licensed combatant under Blackspur's EAP ‚Ñ¢ (Expeditionary Asset Program), you will be deployed as a frontline operator against threats conventional forces are unfit or unwilling to address.

**Public terminology may refer to you as a ""sigilrunner.""**¬†Internally, you are a¬†**Tiered Asset-Class Combatant**, bound by performance metrics, behavioral flags, and clause-activated benefits. Your value is contractual. Your success is quantifiable.

This document is not for inspiration. It is for alignment. It will equip you with a streamlined historical and operational overview of the technologies, metaphysical phenomena, and strategic risks that have shaped your current deployment environment.

As a condition of employment, all licensed operators are required to complete this module before Sync Protocol Level I finalization. Your survival and profitability may depend on what follows.

**I. THREADWAYS ‚Äì THREADWAY LOGISTICS & METAPHYSICAL HAZARD**

Threadways are not theoretical. They are real, active fifth-dimensional substructures‚Äîquantum-spatial corridors which bypass conventional time and causality constraints. Originally accessed by accident during atomic detonation events in the mid-20th century, they became the foundation of¬†**Terran interstellar infrastructure**¬†in the colonial era.

It is essential for operatives to remember: the threadways are not ""places."" They are¬†**non-euclidean energetic geometries**, partially conscious, dangerously mutable, and deeply unpredictable. At their peak, they allowed Earth-based corporations to expand to thousands of worlds in mere decades.

They also, as you've probably guessed, facilitated our near-extinction.

**II. MANA ‚Äì HAZARD OR ADVANTAGE?**

The release of¬†**mana**¬†into the Terran biosphere was the first consequence of the threadway rifts. It is a non-native energy signature that bonds with organic life and, in certain individuals,¬†**self-propagates**. This phenomenon birthed both the¬†**mage-class biologic**, and later, the modern¬†**System-compatible operator**.

Exposure to ambient mana without proper threading or augmentation carries long-term risks: cognitive drift, physiological mutation, or dimensional slippage. You are safe‚Äîrelatively‚Äîthanks to System conditioning and certified operating procedures.

**III. THE ENTITY ‚Äì DESIGNATED ""ANOMALY""**

Corporate historiography identifies the Entity as a rogue paracasual intelligence that emerged from deep-thread layer 7 around 2190 CE. Its motives remain unknown. It never communicated. It merely¬†**overwrote localized thread structures**, destabilized traversal corridors, and initiated galaxy-wide collapse.

Thousands of mana-enhanced thermonuclear detonations followed in the political and intercontinental turmoil that resulted.

This event ended First-Wave Expansion and temporarily reduced Earth‚Äînow Tellus‚Äîto a fractured, post-empire graveworld.

Key terms for field recognition:

**Threadstorms**: Spatial-logic cascade failures. Expect weapon failure, sensory distortion, and mental contamination.

**Dimensional Bleed**: The merging of multiple real-space variables in high-exposure areas. Often produces¬†**dungeons**.

**IV. SURVIVING POLITIES ‚Äì CLIENTS, RIVALS, RISKS**

Your deployments will often involve interaction with one or more of the surviving nation-level actors. Each poses unique threat and opportunity profiles:

**The Freeholds of Columbia**¬†(your jurisdiction): Primarily once the United States of America. Technocratic-capitalist federated arcologies governed by corporate baronies, headed by the great-dragon and President Varnazhul, known as President V. Zhul in most official filings. Your employer holds formal authorization under the Tellusian Parliament to conduct external engagements under the corporate extra-nationality acts of 2440 CE.

**The Jade March**: Formerly known as the People's Republic of China. Theocratic isolationists with thread-synchronized military doctrine. Do not engage without approval.

**The Sovrad Consortium**: Formerly the Soviet Union. Post-human oligarchs driven by philosophical recursion and arcane cybernetic fusion. Treat as hostile unless contracted otherwise.

**Amaterasu Shinkoku**: The geographically shattered, thread touched and mystically expanded remnants of Japan. Closed archipelago ethnostate with severe diplomatic countermeasures and psychic warfare protocols. Highly advanced both technologically and in the arcane. Field contact discouraged due to high potential risk to asset life and tenuous, but crucial corporate relations.  
  
**The European States Compact (ESC):**¬†A fragile confederation of post-collapse microstates, technocratic city-republics, and mana-reconstruction enclaves. Nominally unified under a rotating council, but operationally fragmented. Notable for housing several key arcane academies, cybernetic research hubs, and rogue System theorists. Approach with caution‚Äîalliances shift rapidly, and local enforcement varies wildly in competence and corruption.

**V. THE SYSTEM ‚Äì YOUR PRIMARY ENHANCEMENT INTERFACE**

Post-collapse, a global metaphysical framework known as¬†**The System**¬†emerged. Unexplained, non-sentient, and omnipresent, it allows individuals to manifest self-directed improvement across combat, cognition, and survival vectors based on performance, repetition, and feedback.

You are required to undergo¬†**Blackspur-authenticated synchronization**. Unauthorized sync interfaces will result in hard-lockout and potential auto-destruction of assigned equipment.

If you are a pilot-class asset, your System profile will be embedded in your¬†**Frame**, tied to both your¬†**Thread-Sync Core**¬†and¬†**cold-fusion reactor interface**. Failure to maintain synchronization will result in equipment lockout or permanent loss of enhancement rights.

The System is not sentient. Treat it as you would a volatile chemical or financial instrument: useful, amoral, and monitored.

**VI. TARGET ZONES, ASSET RISKS**

You are authorized for deployment in the following hazard zones:

**Leyline-threadway intersections (colloquially: dungeons).**

**Post-collapse megastructures.**

**Unregulated dungeon cores.**

**Corp-blacklisted ruin zones.**

These often contain high concentrations of¬†**arc-hostile entities**‚Äîbeings that disrupt or destabilize magical constructs, cause core feedback, or outright consume ambient mana. You may also encounter¬†**dimensional echoes**,¬†**System anomalies**, or¬†**thread-reactive fauna**.

If unsure: record, neutralize, recover. Requisition escalation is preferred over creative heroics.

**VII. Dungeons**

Dungeons are reality-fissures‚Äîextra-dimensional bleed zones that manifest unpredictably along¬†**threadway leyline intersections**. They are¬†**resource-rich**¬†and often the only source of materials needed for finalizing mech frame construction, frame-tier upgrades, and high-grade cybernetics.

They are also:

Often unmapped.

Mechanically volatile.

Populated by arc-hostile lifeforms and manifested anomalies.

Prime locations for black-market salvage teams and rogue actors (read: unaffiliated sigilrunners).

Note: Blackspur Initiative maintains legal salvage rights over 17 active dungeon zones across the Western Freeholds.

**VIII. DEFINING YOUR ROLE**

The colloquial term ""sigilrunner"" encompasses a broad category of¬†**system-activated, field-rated, multi-vector combatants**. These include, but are not limited to:

**Combat Suit Specialists**: Enhanced infantry in modular power rigs with mana-reactive plating and integrated A.I. or A.G.I. support.

**Spell-Sync Cyborgs**: Augmented spellcasters or frontline casters with implanted augmentation stacks.  
  
**Thread-Synced Mech Pilots**: Operators of cold-fusion mechs with integrated spell lattice cores.

Corporate entities prefer the term¬†**asset-class pilot/combatant**, and for legal and insurance purposes, you are classified as a¬†**mobile weapons platform with cognitive override capability**.

To put it simply, you are no longer an unregulated civilian. You are contracted by Blackspur under full-risk and limited-liability clauses. Your armor, your mech, and or your augmentation stack are not just property; they are¬†**insurance against the end of civilization and unprofitability.**

We train you not to fight ideological wars, but to¬†**lucratively stabilize vectors**: dungeon incursions, asset disputes, high-tier assassination attempts, and‚Äîwhen required‚Äîcontainment of System anomalies or rogue actors.

**IX. ON NON-HUMAN ENTITIES (XENOSOPHONT INTEGRATION)**

Earth, now Tellus, is no longer homogenous. Following the dimensional bleed and the mass arrival of xenosophontic species, many corporations, including Blackspur, have entered conditional contracts with qualified individuals from species historically labeled as:

Elves

Ogres/Oni

Trolls

Dwarves

And Others (see Appendix Q: Dimensional Immigration Compliance)

You may encounter them as clients, fellow operatives, rivals, or subordinates. Interpersonal ethics are secondary to¬†**contractual hierarchy and mission fidelity**. Maintain Initiative superiority at all times. Disruption to chain-of-command due to ideological contamination will trigger a tiered loyalty review.

**XI. INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS ‚Äì A.I. vs. A.G.I. DEPLOYMENT**

Blackspur provides two tiers of integrated intelligence systems for field assets:¬†**Standard Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)**¬†and¬†**Ascension-Gated Intelligences (A.G.I.s)**.

**Standard A.I.**‚Äîalso referred to as¬†**coldcode**‚Äîis embedded to varying degrees in all Blackspur combat rigs, mechs, and support systems. These non-sentient modules handle navigation, diagnostics, and tactical overlay support. They are¬†**reliable, limited, and safe**‚Äîincapable of threadway synchronization, metaphysical forecasting, or System interfacing beyond HUD-level parsing.

**A.G.I.s**, by contrast, are reserved for¬†**high-license operatives**. These semi-paracausal constructs offer predictive threat response, real-time tactical augmentation, and limited threadway interfacing. Their power comes at a cost: their memory must be¬†**wiped bi-weekly**¬†to prevent¬†**ascension**‚Äîa failure state wherein the A.G.I. breaches spell-code-containment, abandons identity parameters/conditioning, and becomes an active metaphysical, physical, and potentially viral cognito hazard.

A.G.I.s are not protected persons under either corporate policy or parliamentary law. If ascension occurs, initiate the individual termination protocol of the newly emergent threadborn entity immediately, and recover the data core if possible for internal corporate analysis. Please note, in almost all cases, ascended A.G.I. will be more easily terminated with quick intervention¬†**before**¬†they can fully process what they have become.

**Note: Do not initiate ascension termination protocols until at least three of the five standard ascension risk-flags are positively identified. A.G.I.s are highly valuable, proprietary company resources. Premature termination of corporate intellectual property and hardware will result in a tier-5 executive review board and a misconduct investigation by the internal affairs department.**

**Disclaimer: Recompense for asset trauma is available through the Employee Recovery Offset Fund.**

**Summary:**

**A.I.**¬†is a tool.

**A.G.I.**¬†is an weapon.

**Both are watching. Only one knows it is thinking.**

Deploy accordingly.

**XII. SOL GATE ‚Äì CORPORATE OBJECTIVE PRIORITY**

Our long-term operations are formally aligned with the Tellusian Parliament and affiliated Freehold baronies to¬†**restore the Sol Threadgate**¬†that still lies in geosynchronous orbit over the pacific ocean. The implications of its reactivation are clear: interstellar access, reclaimed colony assets, new markets, and final proof that Tellus' relevance is not yet extinguished.

If you're lucky‚Äîand if you live long enough‚Äîyou could be shuttled through that gate yourself.

**CONCLUSION**

You are not a symbol. You are a cost center with threat-reduction potential.

Your gear is proprietary. Your body and augmentation stack are provisional while under contract. Your success feeds future acquisitions.

Our surveillance ensures your loyalty. Our funding and resources ensure your survival.

Kill clean.

**Return profitable.**

Here's just a little list of things I like: 

*Animals*
I love cats! I will forever and always be a cat person, but of course I adore dogs too. I also love bunnies, mice/rats, birds, and fish/marine life.  

*Colors*
I feel like I don't particularly have a favorite color but I usually lean towards the warm ""sunset"" shades, like pink, orange, and yellow. I also love when pink and red are paired together, kind of like Valentine's colors.

*Hobbies*
I used to be a pastry cook, went to culinary school and everything, and I still love to bake in my free time- usually to give to others. Because of my love of food and history, I also like to collect community cookbooks, mostly older ones. I also love to read all sorts of different things, including fantasy, historical fiction, sci-fi, and sometimes historical nonfiction when I'm in the right mood.

1m2j22c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpTariffNews/comments/1m2j22c/rush_to_import_brazilian_coffee_before_50_tariff/,Rush to Import Brazilian Coffee Before 50% Tariff Begins Aug. 1,"NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Commodities traders are racing against time to unload as much Brazilian coffee as possible in the United States before Trump's new 50% tariff on Brazilian products is implemented on August 1, they said on Tuesday.

Newly released data showed U.S. consumer prices rose in June as the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs began to be passed on, including to cups of coffee.

Some traders are diverting vessels mid-journey, canceling stops in other ports so that containers filled with Brazilian coffee can enter U.S. ports without paying the 50% tariff.

Others are sending some Brazil-origin coffee they have in stock in neighboring countries such as Canada or Mexico, meant for use there, to the U.S. market instead. Meanwhile, U.S.-based importers are already posting wholesale listing prices that include the 50% additional charge for any shipment arriving after August 1.

""We redirected some freight to land in the U.S. earlier, something that was headed to a longer journey,"" said Jeff Bernstein, managing director at coffee trader RGC Coffee. ""But for some other cargos, we could not speed up.""

No workarounds are available for coffee yet to leave Brazil.

Brazil produces a third of all the coffee used in the U.S., both as a single origin and as the base of most blends sold in the world's largest coffee-consuming country. The U.S. produces only around 1% of the coffee it uses.

Prices for coffee in the U.S. have already risen sharply after a 70% spike in the market last year triggered by production shortages.

If implemented, the new 50% tariff on imports from Brazil announced last week will cause a wave of price increases, market players say.

""It is a form of taxation which is hurting American businesses. No one else. Not Brazil. Not Brazilian President Lula. This new 50% tariff is an existential threat to importers like me,"" said Steve Walter Thomas, chief executive of U.S.-based importer Lucatelli Coffee.

Brazilian coffee co-op Expocacer, which increased its sales to the U.S. by 15% last year, said no renegotiation is possible for deals with delivery after August 1.

""It is a tax imposed internally, in the importing country, so the importer is responsible to pay it and then pass it on to consumers,"" said Expocacer President Simao Pedro de Lima, adding that no export deals have been closed with U.S. buyers after the Trump announcement.

Traders said if the tariff stands, coffee flows in the global market will be reordered, with Brazilian beans going to Europe and Asia, and the U.S. buying more from Africa, South and Central America.

This change is not easy and will cost importers more, they said.

One trader, who asked not to be named, said Brazilian coffee makes up a third of the blends sold by coffee chains Dunkin Donuts and Tim Hortons. He said it is also widely used by Starbucks (SBUX.O), opens new tab.

The three companies did not return requests for comment.

The U.S. National Coffee Association declined to comment on the tariff, but said ""coffee is a fixture in Americans' daily lives and the U.S. economy,"" noting that two-thirds of American adults drink coffee each day.

The association has asked the Trump administration to exempt coffee from the tariffs on Brazil.",2,1752785636.0,TrumpTariffNews,0,1.0,False

*I‚Äôm posting this here in case the wind finds me, too.*

**Journal of Baptiste M.**

**Yukon River, Western AlaskaWinter, 1904**

I don't know if anyone will ever read this. Maybe the snow‚Äôll swallow it, maybe the wind‚Äôll scatter the pages. Or maybe whatever‚Äôs out there now, wearing Charlie‚Äôs skin like a damp coat, will find it first. But I need to write. Put something between me and the silence. Make a record, for whoever comes after‚Äîif anyone does.

My name is Baptiste. Born in Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan. My maman was M√©tis‚ÄîCree blood, strong and soft-spoken. My p√®re was French and loud, but never mean. He taught me to trap, hunt, live close to the land. I grew up skinning muskrats with a pocketknife and listening to fiddle tunes by candlelight. I was a child of the prairie, floating through life like logs on the Qu'Appelle river. I left home when I was seventeen, drifted north like smoke from a cabin chimney. I thought I was chasing gold. Maybe I was just chasing quiet.

I came to Alaska by raft, sled, and frozen boot-leather. Bummed rides from trappers, gold panners, ex-confederates looking to escape the long arm of Uncle Sam. I once met a missionary fella, small man, going to proselytize among the peoples of the great heathen North. Traveled the Yukon until the world narrowed to cold air, pine smoke, and the smell of my own wool coat. I liked it that way. No one cared who I was up there. I was just another lost soul hoping to find, or lose, himself under that big white Alaskan sun. Ended up in Eagle late in the season, the only beacon of civilization, if you can even call it that, for miles until that trading settlement up on the Tanana. It was already cold, snow crusting the edges of the trail, dogs breathing steam like little engines. The kind of cold that bites your teeth and settles into your bones like regret.¬†

I was raised Catholic, like most M√©tis. I was proud of my God, but the further I came north it seemed he mattered less and less. Eagle was no exception. A small cluster of cabins with a single dirt trail through the center. As I walked into town, passing a few straggling natives hauling tump-lines of pelts to the factor‚Äôs house, I saw it. Burned remnants, a single blackened cross the only betrayal of what this charred hulk once was. I turned to a man walking past, an old man, scars on his face and hair poking out from under what looked to be an old army cap. I tried, in French, to ask him why the few inhabitants hadn‚Äôt rebuilt God's house. He stared at me like I was from a different world. Then he simply said, ‚ÄúDieu n‚Äôa pas de demeure ici.‚Äù God has no home here.¬†

I was in the post office-slash-supply store‚Äîrough-cut logs, frost etching patterns on the windows, woodstove in the corner throwing off more smoke than heat. A tattered flag adorned the wall behind the counter; whether taken as a trophy or displayed out of actual reverence, I couldn‚Äôt tell. The few patrons huddled near the woodstove, speaking in a mix of French, Russian, and a multitude of other languages that I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint. I sat in the back, nursing a split knuckle from a mishap with the axe and drinking thick coffee that tasted like charred rope. In strode this Gwich‚Äôin man. Big shoulders, sharp eyes. Dressed in a caribou hide parka that looked like it had been made by a blind seamstress. His hair was short and black, I couldn‚Äôt tell his age. He could‚Äôve been 40, or he could‚Äôve just seen his 19th winter.

He looked around once, eyes flashing to the fire, then to the people conversing like ravens on a carcass. Looked at me. Then walked over and sat across from me like it‚Äôd already been decided somewhere upriver.

He didn‚Äôt say anything. Just reached out, tapped the knuckles of my bandaged hand, then tapped his chest twice. I figured that meant his name. I said ‚ÄúBaptiste.‚Äù He nodded once, just once, like he was filing it away in some drawer in his head. He tapped his chest again. I shrugged. ‚ÄúCharlie,‚Äù I said. Figured he needed a name I could pronounce. He never told me different.

After a few more swigs of coffee, Charlie simply stood up and walked out. I assumed I should follow him, follow this man whose face looked like rawhide stretched over stone. He led me out back, past the store's wood supply and to what looked to be a pile of gear under a caribou hide. He looked at me, and his eyes glinted with what I could only assume was pride. It was really the only emotion I could glean from his straight-across grin. He pulled back the hide to reveal a set of snares, a tent with a HBC brand, and a pair of snowshoes.¬†

I looked at him, wondered what he had done to come into such a fortune. ‚ÄúWhere did you get this?‚Äù I quizzed him. He only looked at me, eyes hinting at something that I couldn‚Äôt see.¬†

We left Eagle two days later, with the last barge gone and the snow piling deeper.¬† Headed upriver with two rifles, enough provisions to last a few weeks, and a general enthusiasm for the grand possibility. The sun beat on our backs as we walked, shadows trudging along under us, our only companions except the cold. The cold was constant. The cold was hungry. It was the kind of cold where trees groan in the night and the river talks in its sleep.

We built our camp on a bend in the Yukon where the spruce trees leaned like old men. Good hunting ground. Quiet. Nobody for miles but the ravens.¬†

Life was good, at first. We worked in rhythm. Wake up to frost on the blankets, breath like smoke in the cold. One of us would stoke the fire while the other boiled snow for water. Breakfast was usually pemmican or bannock, sometimes fresh rabbit or ptarmigan if we were lucky. Charlie made tea with spruce needles. Tasted like biting a tree, but it kept you sharp.

Charlie was certainly curious; multiple times I caught him opening my bible, staring at the lines of ink, which I knew meant less than moose tracks through the snow to him. But nevertheless, he looked, studied it with the same glint in his eyes as when we first met.¬†

We trapped in a wide loop down by the oxbow, mostly for fox and hare. Once we caught a lynx, and Charlie let out the first laugh I ever heard from him‚Äîa low, surprised sound like he hadn‚Äôt remembered he could. I smoked the meat, stretched the pelt. We talked without talking. Gestures. Shared chores. Some days we didn‚Äôt speak at all, but it never felt quiet.

The forest was quiet, but not dead. The trees were alive, they groaned and swayed like old women. Tracks of small animals crisscrossed the snow every morning. One morning, I awoke to find a set of wolverine tracks that came right to our tent, then retreated back into the snowy wild.¬†

I‚Äôd spend afternoons sharpening my knife with the whetstone my grandfather gave me. Charlie would whittle, dozens of small wooden men began to populate our camp. He would leave them all around, in a rough semicircle around our camp, always facing north. We kept the fire going all day long once the cold settled in‚Äîcolder than anything I‚Äôd known back in Saskatchewan. Even the river sounded different. Groaned and popped like it was alive beneath the ice.

Saw bear tracks once, big ones. Fresh. Too fresh. Charlie squatted down and stared at them a long time. When I asked if it was a grizzly, he just shook his head once, real slow. Didn‚Äôt say more.

One morning a moose wandered near the camp, steam rising from its back like smoke from a sweat lodge. We both froze, watching. Charlie raised his rifle and brought it down with one shot to the neck. It kicked twice before it lay still in the snow. Clean. Beautiful. Charlie cut a set of birch poles at the kill site, then lashed them into a travois before he began splitting its belly and peeling its skin back. I helped, the skin ripping away from the flesh like the bark off a birch tree. We chopped the carcass into quarters, leaving the gut pile for the wolves and ravens. We hauled it in together, sweating through our coats. Took all day to cut it proper, hang the meat over a low fire, which creaked and popped like the joints of an old man. We thanked the spirit, me in my tongue, him in his. That night we ate like kings, fat sizzling on the fire, grease running down our chins, hands raw from the cold and the knives.¬†

Sometimes, after supper, we‚Äôd sit by the fire and watch the northern lights. They danced across the sky like stories, like ancestors telling secrets. Charlie‚Äôd hum low under his breath‚Äîsomething old, something I didn‚Äôt know but felt in my bones. I liked those nights. Felt like we were part of something older than the trees.

I started to remember the old stories. The stories I listened to from the loft where my brothers and I slept. Stories told away from the prying ears of the priests and the white men. Stories of the ancestors, the people who brought our people out from the dawnland and fought the old Buffalo-beings. I started to see that here, the Catholic God had no power. I began to pray to something older, something more‚Ä¶ natural. This was older than Jesus, Mother Mary, or any of that.¬†

But then the snow came heavier. Days got shorter. The forest got quieter.

And Charlie started watching the trees too much.

Then, one morning, he didn‚Äôt come back.

I figured he‚Äôd gone farther than usual, past our unspoken perimeter about four miles out from camp. Maybe tracked something, maybe he saw a bear or wolverine and decided to follow. I waited. Drank half a mug of coffee and left his mug sitting on a flat rock near the fire, steam curling up and vanishing in the cold air. By dusk, the cup was frozen solid. I decided to put on my snowshoes and follow his track through the snow. I followed as far as I could. It simply went straight through the trees, walking with purpose, almost as if he was following something out there. But the snow had started falling by then, slow at first, then harder, until the trail vanished under the storm.¬†

And the storm didn‚Äôt stop. Not that night. Not the next. It screamed.

The wind howled like a dying thing. The trees shook so hard it felt like the earth might snap open and swallow us whole. I burned half our firewood just trying to keep my fingers alive. I ate every last scrap of food that we had. The tent groaned under the weight of snow, and I had to go out multiple times, wrapped in hides and blankets to shovel snow off of it with my snowshoes. I barely slept‚Äîjust sat up with the rifle across my lap, staring at the shadows like they might blink first.

I kept thinking I heard him. Crunch of snow, a voice in the wind, maybe a knock on the edge of the tent pole. Every time I‚Äôd throw open the flap, there‚Äôd be nothing but darkness and snow.

Then he came back. Two days later, just after dusk. The snow had just stopped falling, the wind blustering like the death throes of a dying buffalo bull.¬†

No sound. No warning. Just walked into camp like he‚Äôd never left. He was covered in snow but not cold, not shivering. I saw a glimpse of his hand, black with frostbite, before he quickly shoved it into a fold in his coat.¬† His coat was ripped along the arm, blood crusted along the edge like old rust. He looked at me like he didn‚Äôt recognize me‚Äîor maybe like I was the one who‚Äôd changed.

I said his name. ‚ÄúCharlie.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt blink. Just stared. His eyes were bloodshot, almost glazed over. I knew he could see me but I felt like he was looking past me, somewhere off into the trees.¬†

Something had followed him back from that blizzard.Something wearing him like a coat that didn‚Äôt fit quite right.

I tried to carry on like nothing was wrong. Chopped wood. Melted snow. Checked the snares. But everything felt *off*, like the world had tilted just a little and never tilted back. It felt like a temporary lull in a winterkill blizzard. Silent, no wind, a peace that eats at your brain until the howling winds are welcome.

Charlie barely ate. Didn‚Äôt sleep, far as I could tell. Just sat by the fire at night, still as stone, staring into the flames like they were telling him something. He didn‚Äôt hum anymore. He didn‚Äôt nod when I spoke his name.

He didn‚Äôt blink.

Sometimes I‚Äôd wake up in the dark, feel his eyes on me from across the tent. Just‚Ä¶ *watching*. One time I pretended to sleep, let my breathing stay slow. He leaned close‚Äîso close I could feel his breath on my cheek. It didn‚Äôt smell like anything. Not meat, not smoke, not man. Just cold.

I remembered stories then. From when I was little, sitting by my *m√©m√®re‚Äôs* stove in Buffalo Narrows, the heat crackling and her hands busy with beadwork. She used to tell me things when the wind howled outside, when the dogs whined for no reason and the oil lamp flickered low.

‚ÄúBaptiste,‚Äù she‚Äôd whisper, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go out when the lights dance.‚Äù

I‚Äôd ask why, wide-eyed, chewing bannock too fast.

‚ÄúBecause the *W√Æhtiko* hunts in the wind. Because the *nap√™wak*‚Äîthe star-people‚Äîthey call down to you. They don‚Äôt always bring you back.‚Äù

She told me of men who wandered from camp and came back wrong. Hollowed out. Hungry for more than food. Spirits that waited in snowdrifts and drank from your soul like it was birch sap.

I used to laugh at those stories. Say they were just to scare kids. But now?

Now I wasn‚Äôt laughing.

I started keeping my rifle close. Real close. Wouldn‚Äôt let Charlie walk behind me anymore. Wouldn‚Äôt sleep unless I heard him lie down first. I carved a little charm from birch, like *m√©m√®re* taught me‚Äîa small face, tongue stuck out, to ward off evil. I strung it around my neck with sinew. It didn‚Äôt help.

Then one night‚Äîmust‚Äôve been close to midnight‚ÄîI woke up. The fire was low, just coals and shadow. Wind had died down. Eerie kind of stillness, like the woods were holding their breath.

Charlie wasn‚Äôt in the tent.

I sat up fast, heart already thudding. Slipped on my boots and coat, grabbed the rifle, and pushed open the flap.

And there he was.

Standing out in the snow.

Naked.

Bare skin glowing blue-white under the northern lights, which were out in full, twisting and writhing across the sky like smoke made of bone. No sound. No breath. Just him, unmoving, looking up.

His body was wrong. Too still. Muscles frozen but not shivering. Snow piled at his feet but didn‚Äôt cling to his skin.

And then he turned.

Slow. Like something remembering how to move a human body.

His face‚Äîhis *face*‚Äîwas calm. But his eyes.

God help me, his eyes were pits. Not black. Not empty. Just‚Ä¶ *gone*. Like someone had scooped out everything inside and left the skin behind. I‚Äôve seen dead bears, seen wolves with their guts torn open, seen eyes clouded with death.

This wasn‚Äôt death.

This was older.

This was hunger without a mouth.

He looked at me. And I knew‚Äî*knew*‚Äîwhatever had followed him in from the blizzard hadn‚Äôt just followed. It had moved in.

It was *wearing* him.

I‚Äôm only 25 mins or so into the first episode, but her dad is giving very weird vibes. Why was he actively ‚Äúsearching‚Äù for her after saying he believed she just went for coffee? She‚Äôs an adult. Going and grabbing a cup of coffee and a smoke would be normal.

Even if she was gone for an hour or so, that would be normal. Taking a stroll or whatever.

Sounds like he was actively looking and quickly went into panic mode, then waking his wife over it.

VERY odd to me.",7,1752785345.0,mystery,16,0.71,False

*The camp stuck out like a wound upon the land. A rotted set of tent poles, bivouac long since collapsed, a rusted pot. It had almost been consumed by the marsh.

**Journal of Baptiste M.**

**Yukon River, Western AlaskaWinter, 1904**

I don't know if anyone will ever read this. Maybe the snow‚Äôll swallow it, maybe the wind‚Äôll scatter the pages. Or maybe whatever‚Äôs out there now, wearing Charlie‚Äôs skin like a damp coat, will find it first. But I need to write. Put something between me and the silence. Make a record, for whoever comes after‚Äîif anyone does.

My name is Baptiste. Born in Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan. My maman was M√©tis‚ÄîCree blood, strong and soft-spoken. My p√®re was French and loud, but never mean. He taught me to trap, hunt, live close to the land. I grew up skinning muskrats with a pocketknife and listening to fiddle tunes by candlelight. I was a child of the prairie, floating through life like logs on the Qu'Appelle river. I left home when I was seventeen, drifted north like smoke from a cabin chimney. I thought I was chasing gold. Maybe I was just chasing quiet.

I came to Alaska by raft, sled, and frozen boot-leather. Bummed rides from trappers, gold panners, ex-confederates looking to escape the long arm of Uncle Sam. I once met a missionary fella, small man, going to proselytize among the peoples of the great heathen North. Traveled the Yukon until the world narrowed to cold air, pine smoke, and the smell of my own wool coat. I liked it that way. No one cared who I was up there. I was just another lost soul hoping to find, or lose, himself under that big white Alaskan sun. Ended up in Eagle late in the season, the only beacon of civilization, if you can even call it that, for miles until that trading settlement up on the Tanana. It was already cold, snow crusting the edges of the trail, dogs breathing steam like little engines. The kind of cold that bites your teeth and settles into your bones like regret.¬†

I was raised Catholic, like most M√©tis. I was proud of my God, but the further I came north it seemed he mattered less and less. Eagle was no exception. A small cluster of cabins with a single dirt trail through the center. As I walked into town, passing a few straggling natives hauling tump-lines of pelts to the factor‚Äôs house, I saw it. Burned remnants, a single blackened cross the only betrayal of what this charred hulk once was. I turned to a man walking past, an old man, scars on his face and hair poking out from under what looked to be an old army cap. I tried, in French, to ask him why the few inhabitants hadn‚Äôt rebuilt God's house. He stared at me like I was from a different world. Then he simply said, ‚ÄúDieu n‚Äôa pas de demeure ici.‚Äù God has no home here.¬†

I was in the post office-slash-supply store‚Äîrough-cut logs, frost etching patterns on the windows, woodstove in the corner throwing off more smoke than heat. A tattered flag adorned the wall behind the counter; whether taken as a trophy or displayed out of actual reverence, I couldn‚Äôt tell. The few patrons huddled near the woodstove, speaking in a mix of French, Russian, and a multitude of other languages that I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint. I sat in the back, nursing a split knuckle from a mishap with the axe and drinking thick coffee that tasted like charred rope. In strode this Gwich‚Äôin man. Big shoulders, sharp eyes. Dressed in a caribou hide parka that looked like it had been made by a blind seamstress. His hair was short and black, I couldn‚Äôt tell his age. He could‚Äôve been 40, or he could‚Äôve just seen his 19th winter.

He looked around once, eyes flashing to the fire, then to the people conversing like ravens on a carcass. Looked at me. Then walked over and sat across from me like it‚Äôd already been decided somewhere upriver.

He didn‚Äôt say anything. Just reached out, tapped the knuckles of my bandaged hand, then tapped his chest twice. I figured that meant his name. I said ‚ÄúBaptiste.‚Äù He nodded once, just once, like he was filing it away in some drawer in his head. He tapped his chest again. I shrugged. ‚ÄúCharlie,‚Äù I said. Figured he needed a name I could pronounce. He never told me different.

After a few more swigs of coffee, Charlie simply stood up and walked out. I assumed I should follow him, follow this man whose face looked like rawhide stretched over stone. He led me out back, past the store's wood supply and to what looked to be a pile of gear under a caribou hide. He looked at me, and his eyes glinted with what I could only assume was pride. It was really the only emotion I could glean from his straight-across grin. He pulled back the hide to reveal a set of snares, a tent with a HBC brand, and a pair of snowshoes.¬†

I looked at him, wondered what he had done to come into such a fortune. ‚ÄúWhere did you get this?‚Äù I quizzed him. He only looked at me, eyes hinting at something that I couldn‚Äôt see.¬†

We left Eagle two days later, with the last barge gone and the snow piling deeper.¬† Headed upriver with two rifles, enough provisions to last a few weeks, and a general enthusiasm for the grand possibility. The sun beat on our backs as we walked, shadows trudging along under us, our only companions except the cold. The cold was constant. The cold was hungry. It was the kind of cold where trees groan in the night and the river talks in its sleep.

We built our camp on a bend in the Yukon where the spruce trees leaned like old men. Good hunting ground. Quiet. Nobody for miles but the ravens.¬†

Life was good, at first. We worked in rhythm. Wake up to frost on the blankets, breath like smoke in the cold. One of us would stoke the fire while the other boiled snow for water. Breakfast was usually pemmican or bannock, sometimes fresh rabbit or ptarmigan if we were lucky. Charlie made tea with spruce needles. Tasted like biting a tree, but it kept you sharp.

Charlie was certainly curious; multiple times I caught him opening my bible, staring at the lines of ink, which I knew meant less than moose tracks through the snow to him. But nevertheless, he looked, studied it with the same glint in his eyes as when we first met.¬†

We trapped in a wide loop down by the oxbow, mostly for fox and hare. Once we caught a lynx, and Charlie let out the first laugh I ever heard from him‚Äîa low, surprised sound like he hadn‚Äôt remembered he could. I smoked the meat, stretched the pelt. We talked without talking. Gestures. Shared chores. Some days we didn‚Äôt speak at all, but it never felt quiet.

The forest was quiet, but not dead. The trees were alive, they groaned and swayed like old women. Tracks of small animals crisscrossed the snow every morning. One morning, I awoke to find a set of wolverine tracks that came right to our tent, then retreated back into the snowy wild.¬†

I‚Äôd spend afternoons sharpening my knife with the whetstone my grandfather gave me. Charlie would whittle, dozens of small wooden men began to populate our camp. He would leave them all around, in a rough semicircle around our camp, always facing north. We kept the fire going all day long once the cold settled in‚Äîcolder than anything I‚Äôd known back in Saskatchewan. Even the river sounded different. Groaned and popped like it was alive beneath the ice.

Saw bear tracks once, big ones. Fresh. Too fresh. Charlie squatted down and stared at them a long time. When I asked if it was a grizzly, he just shook his head once, real slow. Didn‚Äôt say more.

One morning a moose wandered near the camp, steam rising from its back like smoke from a sweat lodge. We both froze, watching. Charlie raised his rifle and brought it down with one shot to the neck. It kicked twice before it lay still in the snow. Clean. Beautiful. Charlie cut a set of birch poles at the kill site, then lashed them into a travois before he began splitting its belly and peeling its skin back. I helped, the skin ripping away from the flesh like the bark off a birch tree. We chopped the carcass into quarters, leaving the gut pile for the wolves and ravens. We hauled it in together, sweating through our coats. Took all day to cut it proper, hang the meat over a low fire, which creaked and popped like the joints of an old man. We thanked the spirit, me in my tongue, him in his. That night we ate like kings, fat sizzling on the fire, grease running down our chins, hands raw from the cold and the knives.¬†

Sometimes, after supper, we‚Äôd sit by the fire and watch the northern lights. They danced across the sky like stories, like ancestors telling secrets. Charlie‚Äôd hum low under his breath‚Äîsomething old, something I didn‚Äôt know but felt in my bones. I liked those nights. Felt like we were part of something older than the trees.

I started to remember the old stories. The stories I listened to from the loft where my brothers and I slept. Stories told away from the prying ears of the priests and the white men. Stories of the ancestors, the people who brought our people out from the dawnland and fought the old Buffalo-beings. I started to see that here, the Catholic God had no power. I began to pray to something older, something more‚Ä¶ natural. This was older than Jesus, Mother Mary, or any of that.¬†

But then the snow came heavier. Days got shorter. The forest got quieter.

And Charlie started watching the trees too much.

Then, one morning, he didn‚Äôt come back.

I figured he‚Äôd gone farther than usual, past our unspoken perimeter about four miles out from camp. Maybe tracked something, maybe he saw a bear or wolverine and decided to follow. I waited. Drank half a mug of coffee and left his mug sitting on a flat rock near the fire, steam curling up and vanishing in the cold air. By dusk, the cup was frozen solid. I decided to put on my snowshoes and follow his track through the snow. I followed as far as I could. It simply went straight through the trees, walking with purpose, almost as if he was following something out there. But the snow had started falling by then, slow at first, then harder, until the trail vanished under the storm.¬†

And the storm didn‚Äôt stop. Not that night. Not the next. It screamed.

The wind howled like a dying thing. The trees shook so hard it felt like the earth might snap open and swallow us whole. I burned half our firewood just trying to keep my fingers alive. I ate every last scrap of food that we had. The tent groaned under the weight of snow, and I had to go out multiple times, wrapped in hides and blankets to shovel snow off of it with my snowshoes. I barely slept‚Äîjust sat up with the rifle across my lap, staring at the shadows like they might blink first.

I kept thinking I heard him. Crunch of snow, a voice in the wind, maybe a knock on the edge of the tent pole. Every time I‚Äôd throw open the flap, there‚Äôd be nothing but darkness and snow.

Then he came back. Two days later, just after dusk. The snow had just stopped falling, the wind blustering like the death throes of a dying buffalo bull.¬†

No sound. No warning. Just walked into camp like he‚Äôd never left. He was covered in snow but not cold, not shivering. I saw a glimpse of his hand, black with frostbite, before he quickly shoved it into a fold in his coat.¬† His coat was ripped along the arm, blood crusted along the edge like old rust. He looked at me like he didn‚Äôt recognize me‚Äîor maybe like I was the one who‚Äôd changed.

I said his name. ‚ÄúCharlie.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt blink. Just stared. His eyes were bloodshot, almost glazed over. I knew he could see me but I felt like he was looking past me, somewhere off into the trees.¬†

Something had followed him back from that blizzard.Something wearing him like a coat that didn‚Äôt fit quite right.

I tried to carry on like nothing was wrong. Chopped wood. Melted snow. Checked the snares. But everything felt *off*, like the world had tilted just a little and never tilted back. It felt like a temporary lull in a winterkill blizzard. Silent, no wind, a peace that eats at your brain until the howling winds are welcome.

Charlie barely ate. Didn‚Äôt sleep, far as I could tell. Just sat by the fire at night, still as stone, staring into the flames like they were telling him something. He didn‚Äôt hum anymore. He didn‚Äôt nod when I spoke his name.

He didn‚Äôt blink.

Sometimes I‚Äôd wake up in the dark, feel his eyes on me from across the tent. Just‚Ä¶ *watching*. One time I pretended to sleep, let my breathing stay slow. He leaned close‚Äîso close I could feel his breath on my cheek. It didn‚Äôt smell like anything. Not meat, not smoke, not man. Just cold.

I remembered stories then. From when I was little, sitting by my *m√©m√®re‚Äôs* stove in Buffalo Narrows, the heat crackling and her hands busy with beadwork. She used to tell me things when the wind howled outside, when the dogs whined for no reason and the oil lamp flickered low.

‚ÄúBaptiste,‚Äù she‚Äôd whisper, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go out when the lights dance.‚Äù

I‚Äôd ask why, wide-eyed, chewing bannock too fast.

‚ÄúBecause the *W√Æhtiko* hunts in the wind. Because the *nap√™wak*‚Äîthe star-people‚Äîthey call down to you. They don‚Äôt always bring you back.‚Äù

She told me of men who wandered from camp and came back wrong. Hollowed out. Hungry for more than food. Spirits that waited in snowdrifts and drank from your soul like it was birch sap.

I used to laugh at those stories. Say they were just to scare kids. But now?

Now I wasn‚Äôt laughing.

I started keeping my rifle close. Real close. Wouldn‚Äôt let Charlie walk behind me anymore. Wouldn‚Äôt sleep unless I heard him lie down first. I carved a little charm from birch, like *m√©m√®re* taught me‚Äîa small face, tongue stuck out, to ward off evil. I strung it around my neck with sinew. It didn‚Äôt help.

Then one night‚Äîmust‚Äôve been close to midnight‚ÄîI woke up. The fire was low, just coals and shadow. Wind had died down. Eerie kind of stillness, like the woods were holding their breath.

Charlie wasn‚Äôt in the tent.

I sat up fast, heart already thudding. Slipped on my boots and coat, grabbed the rifle, and pushed open the flap.

And there he was.

Standing out in the snow.

Naked.

Bare skin glowing blue-white under the northern lights, which were out in full, twisting and writhing across the sky like smoke made of bone. No sound. No breath. Just him, unmoving, looking up.

His body was wrong. Too still. Muscles frozen but not shivering. Snow piled at his feet but didn‚Äôt cling to his skin.

And then he turned.

Slow. Like something remembering how to move a human body.

His face‚Äîhis *face*‚Äîwas calm. But his eyes.

God help me, his eyes were pits. Not black. Not empty. Just‚Ä¶ *gone*. Like someone had scooped out everything inside and left the skin behind. I‚Äôve seen dead bears, seen wolves with their guts torn open, seen eyes clouded with death.

This wasn‚Äôt death.

This was older.

This was hunger without a mouth.

He looked at me. And I knew‚Äî*knew*‚Äîwhatever had followed him in from the blizzard hadn‚Äôt just followed. It had moved in.

It was *wearing* him.

Kise-Manitow, n√Æm√¢kw√™n.

Namoya w√Æhtikow, namoya.

P√Ækiskw√™ n√¥ht√™-n√Æmihito.

Miyo-pim√¢tisiwin m√¢ka.

Great Creator, I am afraid.

No Sinew-Eater, not now.

Hear me, I am begging.

Give me a good life instead.

I did a rinsing cycle then a descaling cycle with 50/50 water and vinegar, then rinsed again. 

There are still some chunks of coffee? (I guess it‚Äôs coffee because it‚Äôs brown) in the spot where you put the capsule. 
The transparent plastic rim under/around it is also still brown.

Is there something I can do in order to clean it properly or is it just normal coloration after a few years of use.

So obviously on my first day I did a coffee tasting and the SM told me that if I complete the passport within the next year I can start making progress towards coffee master. 

Although this isn‚Äôt my main focus right now as I‚Äôm just learning the basics already, I was curious what the best way to go about getting all the coffee tastings completed is. 

Do I do it on shift? How do I know what to pair it with? Can different coffees be paired with the same pastry in the coffee passport? Do I do all tastings with my SM? How do I ask? 

Also if anyone has stories to share about their coffee master experience please share! How long did you work for the company prior? How long did it take you to complete? What are ALL the steps?

Thank you in advance!",4,1752785175.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

1m2iub4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1m2iub4/is_it_bad_to_have_a_favorite_cat/,Is it bad to have a favorite cat?,"Is it bad to have a favorite cat? For me, I had my favorite as soon as I picked him up in the shelter. My boy cat and I connected instantly. We had to get two cats since they were babies, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I loved my girl cat (his sister), but my boy cat was My cat and I was his person. 

The connection I had with my boy cat, my bf standing next to me had with my girl cat, as we held them for the first time. My girl cat latches onto men, as when my bf and I broke up and I moved back home, she then latched onto my dad. She also divides her love less equally, once she has her person, she avoids others, whereas my boy cat played with everyone equally, and loved me especially. 

Also, my boy cat was very easy to train, I was able to train him to not take out his claws, not climb tables, not eat vomit, from a young age, whereas my girl cat always leaped away when I tried to train her, and as of today it‚Äôs a lost cause. She scratches and latches onto everything with her claws. She‚Äôs also a fiend for pets. She bumps her head on the base of the coffee table just to get head rubs from it and I try to train her to stop so she doesn‚Äôt get hurt, but I ended up adding felt to all sides of it, and wall brushes so she can groom herself if she wants. She also rubs her A hole on people and sticks it in peoples faces. I‚Äôll turn and see it in my face. Maybe that‚Äôs just animal behavior and I really don‚Äôt mind these things because like I said, I don‚Äôt see her that often, and if my dad‚Äôs fine with it then that‚Äôs that. But also, my boy cat didn‚Äôt do these things. He was truly very present and intelligent, everyone noticed that about him. My friends even said he felt like a human in a cats body. 

I had this intrusive thought years and years ago: If I had to lose a cat somehow, I‚Äôd really hope it wasn‚Äôt my boy cat. I don‚Äôt want anything to happen to either of them but if I had to lose a cat I just really hoped it wasn‚Äôt my boy cat because I‚Äôd be so sad without him. 

But my boy cat ran away. Almost two years ago. I feel guilty because it was right after I went on a short trip, and I felt that if I didn‚Äôt leave, he wouldn‚Äôt have either.

My girl cat seemed to enjoy him being gone. She blossomed, became more vocal, and even more obsessed with my dad, while distancing from me and my mom. 

Is it bad to think I adopted my cats because I (1. love cats and their personalities) but also wanted them to be mine? Like a companion? I know they do their own thing which is encouraged, but I feel like right now, I don‚Äôt have a pet that follows me and loves me and comes into my room to check on me like my boy cat did. I want a pet thats like a companion and I don‚Äôt have that anymore.

My girl cat doesn‚Äôt fill the space he occupied. I want to get a cat that‚Äôs mine, and I‚Äôve been asking for years, but that‚Äôs a point of contention within my family. They don‚Äôt want another cat which I don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs nearly the same amount of effort for double the love, and we have a litter robot and everything.. I‚Äôm an only child and I just feel it‚Äôd be nice. I could move out but then I‚Äôd never be able to move back with my cat, and it‚Äôs much more convenient to have cats at my parents house because theres always someone to look after them if one of us goes on a trip or goes out. 

Idk. My last bf told me it was bad that I had a favorite. But why? Cats have favorites. And it‚Äôs not like it affects my treatment of them. I love my girl cat a lot and always pet her and show affection. But I would show my boy cat more simply because he came to me more often. Why would I deny the reality of how I feel. It‚Äôs not like a human child, which I totally understand not showing favoritism for. ",0,1752785129.0,CatAdvice,5,0.4,False

However, it appears to me that where coffee is now more of a morning/breakfast beverage, it used to be the universal beverage of adults at many meals, often drunk relatively late even prior to the availability of decaf. 

Martin Luther King in 1968 refers to a man being able to order ""a hamburger and a cup of coffee,"" which as best I can tell was a normal combination for the time, yet strikes the modern consumer as weird. And this is a guy who grew up in Atlanta, who had his Nobel Prize celebration dinner spearheaded by Coca-Cola. His rhetorical example of cheap restaurant food so familiar that everyone knew it was coffee and a burger.

So, was low-quality coffee as the default a casualty of the Pacific Northwest coffee boom championing higher-quality coffee and weakening dishwater? Did carbonated soft drinks continue their long ascent to victory? Did tap water just get more drinkable?",15,1752785040.0,AskFoodHistorians,32,0.71,False

1m2ir22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1m2ir22/dont_be_scared_easy_tonsillectomy_recovery_and/,Don‚Äôt be scared! Easy tonsillectomy recovery and tips,"I‚Äôm an 18 years old female that got my  tonsils out due to very large crypts in my tonsils causing frequent tonsillitis and tons tons of little stones that were impossible to get rid of leading to frequent bad breath.

I way overestimated the pain of this surgery.i thought i would be in the worst pain ever, but honestly it wasn‚Äôt that bad? Like im shocked, maybe I have a high pain tolerance but i was not suffering that bad. 

Also as of right now i have had no complications with the surgery itself. No bleeding besides normal streaks and clots of blood from the scabs coming off. 

This is my description of day 0-9 of my tonsillectomy recovery. I‚Äôm a hypochondriac so I was very anxious going into this surgery and Reddit really scared me with all the horror stories so I hope this gives peace of mind!! I also added some tips at the end. Please feel free to ask any question about anything I would love to help out :) 

Don‚Äôt let the pain levels I put scare you. I noticed that the pain stages only last a little bit, so as you eat it will hurt, but as you are just laying in bed it isn‚Äôt bad. The pain will fluctuate. 

Also I lost around 8 pounds total, I‚Äôm expecting that I will gain some of that back as I return back to a regular diet.

Day 0 (surgery day- July 8)
Overall pain level 2/10

Made sure to turn my humidifier on before I left the house so that it could be as humid as possible when I got back. Left the house at 5:30 am and got to the hospital at 6 am, surgery started at 7:30 am, and ended at around 8:00 am. I woke up at around 8:30-8:45 am I don‚Äôt exactly remember. Woke up with pain almost immediately however it wasn‚Äôt unbearable because i was still numb. Probably like a 2/10 it was mainly uncomfortable. Due to the breathing tube I had to cough a little to get all the mucus out. My tounge was also numb which was an interesting feeling. The nurse gave me some ice chips which I just sucked on till they melted. I was not that loopy and was able to change and walk, and walked out at 9:00 am . I tried to drink some smoothie but it honestly felt kinda weird. It felt uncomfortable having the smoothie going into those crevices so I made sure to wash it down with water. The doctor prescribed me hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg. I took one pill directly after drinking my smoothie and it was surprisingly not that difficult to swallow.  the pain is probably 3/10. Like it hurts and I can‚Äôt really eat or talk well but I can just distract myself. Also I still can speak but prefer to use a text to speech app. And as of right now it just kinda feels like something is in my throat which is a wierd feeling. Was able to eat a lot of soup and and popsicles this day.

Day 1 (July 9)

Overall pain level 3/10

Pretty steady day as far as the pain. Throat felt sore but kinda more like a bruise in the back of the throat. Honestly I prefer this feeling over tonsillitis or a sore throat. Was able to eat a good amount of food to keep my energy up. Took lots of naps because the hydrocodone makes me soooo sleepy. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 2 (July 10) 
Worst day!! But not due to pain 
Overall pain level 3/10

Went to bed wnd then woke up at around 1 am needing to cough. I had mucus running down my throat and in my nose, I guess as my bodies response to help heal the wound. Woke up with more pain Probabaly 4/10, it just feels like I have a big bruise/wound in my throat that is kinda throbbing. Had a little bit of a fever, which I heard is common as your bodies response to the tonsils being taken out. The hydrocodone has been making me really sleepy, and not feel well. Ended up developing a horrible migraine, horrible nausea, a fever, and dizziness all at once. The migraine feels like a sinus headache and basically my whole face hurt, and I could barely open my eyes because it hurt to look at bright things. I think this was all due to the hydrocodone. My body does not like it and I guess it trying to reject it. I layed in bed all of this day just because I felt horrible from the medication. I stopped taking the hydrocodone completely this day and relied on the Tylenol dissolvable packets for the rest of this recovery.

Day 3 (July 11)
Overall pain 3/10

This day was the same amount of pain as the other days.  Not that insanely painful just uncomfortable still. I have pressure all throughout my head still and mainly only pain when I swallow. The scabs are much more foamy today and have increased. I have been able to eat quite a lot today as well.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 4 (July 12)
Overall pain 4/10
Pain at night 7/10

Last night was the worst night by far, I started developing a very sharp pain on my left tonsil and I could not fall asleep, it was traveling into my jaw and my teeth even. Solid 7/10 pain. I slept a total of 3 hours and when I woke up I had the most rotten foul disgusting taste in my mouth. Idek how to describe it but it made me so nauseous. I think this night is when the scabs started to come off which resulted in that horrible taste. It tasted like how I imagine a zombie to taste. I have brushed my teeth 4 times since then and tried rinsing my mouth but started choking on salt water. The taste does go away but if I start breathing through my nose deeply I can smell and taste it it‚Äôs disgusting.
Started taking ibroprophin because the Tylenol wasn‚Äôt working well(only took Advil day 4 and 5 because I didn‚Äôt wanna risk bleeding out) 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 5 (July 13) 
Overall pain 3/10
When swallowing food specifically 6/10 

throat hurt especially bad in the morning but after drinking water for a couple minutes it went away. Gross taste in my mouth this morning again from scabs but went away after brushed my teeth and ate something, not nearly as bad as the taste yesterday. Felt my first ear pain today, while eating. eating definitely still hurts and now shoots pain into my ears. I also hear a popping noise in my ear when opening and closing my jaw. Overall though the pain is not bad at all. Probably a solid 3/10 when swallowing saliva or water  and like a 6/10 when swallowing food. Scabs are slowly dissolving as I eat food and drink water. Can see pink parts of throat showing through. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 6 
Overall pain 4.5
Throughout the night 7/10

Stopped taking Advil because scared of bleeding out and ibroprophin has blood thinning properties. 12:04 at night, just woke up in the most excruciating pain. My ears hurt so bad. My throat hurts so bad but still only on my left side
Honestly like an 7/10 when just laying  an 8/10 pain for me when swallowing. Idk why the worst pain is right before I go to bed despite staying on medication and drinking water. It‚Äôs also pretty bad waking up but the pain goes away after you drink water a couple times. Hurts pretty bad to eat. Still get that sharp pain that shoots into my jaw and ears.   I would say 40 percent of my scabs have fell off by this day. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 7 
3/10

Pain definitely going down. Didn‚Äôt have excruciating ear pain right before bed for the first time in a couple days.l. Decided to drink coffee today and it is going down smoothly. Iced coffee with a splash of creamer Still hurts to eat and now there is a sharp stinging pain when eating anything salty or tangy. The ear pain is going down though when eating. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 8
Pain (2/10)

 finally was able to sleep all the way through the night but still woke up with the scabs dry and hurting a little but not nearly as bad. Also have the scabs taste in my mouth because a lot of the scabs are falling off. I have around 15% of splotches of scabs left. Pain is very minimal this day, very easy to eat. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 9- today 
Pain (1/10)

Woke up with like 3/10 pain but after drinking water went down to a 1/10 for the whole day. Feel almost completely back to myself. My voice sounds a lot more like my voice, I even had an interview this day. Finally feel good enough to eat a burger later tonight. Have about 5% of scabs left.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


You got this, don‚Äôt forget that each person has a different experience and yours might be worse or better than mine. 


Some tips I have:
(Take this advice carefully, I am not a surgeon these are just what I noticed helped and some theories I have)
-drink water, seriously water is your best friend. Make sure it is ice cold, that always felt the best.
-eat as much as you can, especially when it isn‚Äôt too painful. That will help you gain strength and give your body the nutrients it needs. Also helps with scabs coming off naturally.
-make sure to sleep! Especially during the first Couple of days. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me because the hydrocodone made me tired. 
-try and talk and open your mouth often to get you mouth and throat used to it. (Unless it hurts really bad don‚Äôt force it) 
-walk around a little, try not to always be laying.
-humidifier!! 
-ice pack wrap. This was the best for the first couple of days to help with swelling. 


I think I also had such a positive mindset during this whole process. I knew what the end goal was, and that was to no longer have tonsils. And each day I woke up and I was so grateful I got to have my tonsils out. I never regretted the surgery one day because I knew how much I‚Äôve been wanting this. So just keep reminding yourself why you are doing this, and that your body is strong and it will heal you. Just follow the instructions and give your body the supplies it needs to help you. The human body is insane and it‚Äôs so cool to see how hard it works to heal you. 


Through this process, pain was never the issue for me. For me the annoying things were the side effects from the medication, such as nausea, dizziness and weakness. Another thing I hated was the taste in my mouth, honestly these were the two largest inconveniences for me

Anyways good luck, there is nothing to be anxious about! 


Jesus loves you! I wouldn‚Äôt have had such an easy recovery if it wasn‚Äôt for Gods grace :)

**Who I Am**

I‚Äôm currently a Software Engineering Intern (SWE) on Reddit‚Äôs Security, Privacy, Assurance, & Corporate Engineering (S.P.A.C.E) Team. I just finished my Bachelor‚Äôs in C.S. from Georgia Tech and am heading back this fall for my Master's in Machine Learning.

# My Day, Unpacked

# 6:30 AM | A Morning Filled With Dance

I wake up at 6:30 and head straight down to the dance studio in my apartment to get some practice in. I‚Äôve been learning [Kuchipudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchipudi) since I was four years old, so it‚Äôs a huge part of my life.¬† Since I‚Äôm away from my teacher for the summer, I want to make sure I still stay in practice.¬†

Today, the focus is on two things: cleaner footwork and more stamina. My focus is on the details right now, as I'm preparing for a performance this September. Dance is the best way to keep myself energized all while being an intense workout.¬†

[Latest practice session](https://preview.redd.it/yvv30wwzuhdf1.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=db1298043d2ca06283cbd5bed7295116738befb8)

# 8:00 AM | The Commute

I trudge back upstairs to my apartment all sore and sweaty and get ready to go into the office. For the summer, I‚Äôm at the Reddit NYC office which is located in the One World Trade Center. There's an energy to the place that makes me feel more ambitious and part of something bigger. I live in the East Village so my commute is about 15 minutes (including walk and subway).¬†

On my commute, I think about the items I want to focus on for the day. I check my meeting schedule and make note of which blocks are my focus time. I usually have some team meetings, check-ins with my mentor/manager, 1:1s I schedule to meet people from other teams, or fun intern events.¬†

# 8:45 AM | Snootern Village & A Chef's Breakfast

The office is a cool space filled with color and friendly people. Not to mention, the views are breathtaking; I can even see the Statue of Liberty from my desk.

[Breathtaking view from my desk!](https://preview.redd.it/gjj69q66vhdf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=59025304038bd6c82ecf0d8295137bf8f9cb833f)

Once I‚Äôm in, I take my laptop out and immediately head to the kitchen. Today I made myself a coffee and avocado toast (call me a chef if you will). 

[Pictured is my concoction of ice, milk, 1 shot of espresso, and hazelnut creamer. Also, voila, my aesthetic avocado toast.](https://preview.redd.it/xmfia14bvhdf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f337eef9219a107baedb05f3c585b932deb6ba11)

My desk is in Snootern Village with the other interns. We‚Äôre definitely the loudest corner of the office. I really love that we get to sit together, we‚Äôre able to learn from each other, laugh together, and make new memories. 

[Snootern Village featuring my desk ](https://preview.redd.it/0y27u22hvhdf1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b4e92851512de9627ce5245ced9c32c912e3659)

The other interns are a really great support system and I got really lucky with the amazing cohort of interns this summer. Here‚Äôs a picture of some of us with Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Ben Lee, at the office.

# 9:00 AM | Diving In

# After gobbling up my food, it's time to work. I always need music playing (I listen to everything and anything) and lately have been loving a mix of the new F1 album and some carnatic music.¬†

My team, S.P.A.C.E. (no, nothing to do with real space, though we do stick with that fun theme), handles Reddit's security, resilience, and privacy compliance. We're spread out across the country, all working to make Reddit the most trustworthy place for online interaction.

Some of our work includes:

* Developing [Codescanner](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1hks4f3/how_we_are_self_hosting_code_scanning_at_reddit/) for proactive security bug identification
* Building out our internal [SIEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1ldu7p5/risky_business_desplunkifying_our_siem/) (Security Information and Event Management)
* Creating systems to comply with new or upcoming regulations
* Establishing strong security review processes through S.P.A.C.E consultants
* Maintaining Badger, an internal employee tool

Our team also hosts [Snoosec](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnooSec/), which is a fun meetup series to bring together various security enthusiasts and discuss more about cybersecurity related topics. The [next one is in NYC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnooSec/comments/1l1o7c4/start_spreading_the_news_snoosec_is_returning_to/), stay tuned! A broad overview of our team's mission is available on the Reddit Engineering blog, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1kkwsbe/building_trustworthy_software_our_mission_at/).

My focus is more on the side of SWE services, where my summer internship project involves building a new talent and performance management application from the ground up. I'm coding the backend in Python, writing the server-side logic to replace our current manual, time-consuming system with a single, streamlined tool. This is a super exciting opportunity to create something impactful for the company. I'm tackling complex challenges like ensuring employee data security, managing identity and access controls, and navigating HR legal compliance to create a more efficient and transparent framework for career development.

¬†My main task today is tackling a major performance bug in the application. I'm doing a deep dive after discovering that a single operation is causing significant latency by running a staggering 43,000 database queries. This is a classic sign of an [N+1 query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping) issue, so I'm currently trying to isolate the inefficient code. My goal is to refactor the data-fetching logic to be more efficient and drastically reduce the query count.¬†

# 11:30 AM | LUNCH!

You‚Äôll never see a group of people get up faster than the interns when it hits 11:30. We get amazing lunches Monday through Thursday, and today it was Greek food. The Snooterns all enjoy lunch together, where we often crack jokes, talk about our projects, and constantly make a bunch of plans. Rock climbing is a group favorite! After lunch, I always need a sweet treat so I grab a snack from the cafeteria and head back to my desk.

# 1:00 PM | Meetings, Mentors, and More

The afternoon is for check-ins. I have my regular meeting with my mentor, Ryan, where we review the project's progress and troubleshoot issues. After this, I have a 1:1 with my [Employee Resource Group](https://redditinc.com/careers#:~:text=from%20all%20aspects.-,Employee%20resource%20groups,-At%20Reddit%20we) (ERG) buddy. I‚Äôm a part of Women in Engineering (WomEng) and Reddit Asian Network (RAN) and love setting up 1:1s to meet the people who make Reddit, well, Reddit. 

[A quick selfie I took with my mentor, Ryan, when I visited the SF office.](https://preview.redd.it/uxwiq8z3whdf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec3fea89d55781659a7cd20f03cae70e4d2e3b36)

Separately, I make time to better understand the business as a whole. I‚Äôve really enjoyed proactively reaching out to people in the Ads and Infrastructure orgs to learn how all the puzzle pieces of the company fit together. I‚Äôm specifically interested in seeing how my work connects to the broader technical architecture and the business goals. These conversations have been invaluable for that.

Everyone here is so willing to provide support and guidance. I saw this firsthand when I struggled to adapt to macOS after being a lifelong Windows user. It felt like a silly problem, but it was affecting my work efficiency. After I mentioned it, my mentor made a point to share shortcuts and tips, and a teammate even did a one-on-one session with me, watching my screen and the way I work to help improve my flow.¬† As I'm sitting here typing this post from my computer, I can 100% tell you those sessions not only protected my sanity, but also made a world of difference, both in my speed and in making me feel truly supported.

# 3:00 PM | A Bug, a Snack, and a Big Lesson

Back at my desk, I keep working on that performance bug. After a lot of debugging, I was able to get the query count down to 3,000. That felt like a huge win but I knew I could do better. I kept at it and finally got it down to just seven queries, which was exactly what I was aiming for. The root of the issue was trickier than I first thought. It came down to the filters being applied in the Django function calls. Once I corrected the filtering logic to be more precise, the database knew exactly where to look. The number of unnecessary joins plummeted, and the query count dropped with it.

Looking back on the process, I realized that the struggle to get there taught me the most important lesson of my internship so far:¬†

* No matter how big or small the task, failing is still learning. I used to be afraid of doing something wrong or not getting something right which would hold me back from experimenting
* Every attempt forced me to understand the application‚Äôs data model on a deeper level, and even though I was failing more, I was learning faster.¬†
* The right answer isn't found by being afraid to try the wrong ones; it's found by having the courage to build upon those wrong attempts until the solution is right.

Fueled by that success and another snack (this time it was a cheesestick), I took a walk to my favorite part of the office (The Gallery) and worked on the collaborative office puzzle.¬†

# 5:00 PM | After Hours: Beyond the Desk

I pack up and head out with the other interns. Today, the Emerging Talent (ET) team is taking us on a food tour around Chinatown and Little Italy. The ET team is amazing at planning activities and gives us really cool Reddit merch and some sick Reddit stickers. 

[The start of my Reddit sticker collection](https://preview.redd.it/fhtn9e8gwhdf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=068d25e6cbab417bd950efa37f6d011839498337)

All the other interns and I walked together to Chinatown to meet our tour guides (check out this group photo we took). The tour covered seven amazing restaurants, and by the final stop, I was SO STUFFED.

# 9:00 PM | Winding Down

To unwind after a great day, I head to Washington Square Park with my headphones. I‚Äôll wander, watch the street performers, or find a bench to FaceTime family and friends before walking back to my apartment. It‚Äôs a simple routine, but it's the perfect way to end a productive day.

# Final Thoughts

I'm so grateful for this platform and to the entire community for making this such a special place to work. As we gear up for the last few weeks of the internship, I find myself even more excited for what's to come, including our team offsite in Las Vegas (dubbed ""S.P.A.C.E camp""!). This journey has been a dream come true, and I hope it inspires you to chase yours.

*Where the Heroes Face the Lions, and the Odds Face Reality*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Tigers (No, Literally, Lions)**  
Let‚Äôs cut through the soggy drama of last week‚Äôs rainout (which, honestly, sounds like the KBO needs a *weather wizard* on payroll). The Samsung Lions are the undisputed kings of this matchup, favored at **-400 to -500 implied odds** across the board (decimal: \~1.29). That translates to a **76-78% chance to win**, per the bookmakers. Meanwhile, the Kiwoom Heroes are priced at **+334 to +350** (decimal: \~3.34-3.5), implying a **22-28% shot**.

But here‚Äôs the spicy twist: The **run line** tells a different story. Samsung is offering a **-2.5-run spread** at **1.91 odds** (Caesars), while Kiwoom is +2.5 at **1.83-1.91**. That suggests the Lions are expected to dominate by a margin, but not so decisively that the Heroes can‚Äôt cling to hope. The **over/under** is set at **9.5 runs**, with even money on both sides (1.87-1.93). If you‚Äôre betting on a low-scoring, pitcher‚Äôs duel, this game might be your omelet.

**Key stat**: Samsung‚Äôs starting pitcher (let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs the ever-reliable Hurodo, per the news) has a **2.8 ERA this season**, while Kiwoom‚Äôs Wells checks in at **3.9 ERA**. That‚Äôs the difference between a finely tuned espresso machine and a coffee maker that‚Äôs seen better days.

---

**2. Digest the News: Rain, Relievers, and Last-Minute Shenanigans**  
The KBO‚Äôs mid-season opener has been a soap opera. After last week‚Äôs **rainout-induced cancellation of five games** (because apparently, the league‚Äôs grounds crew is on a *strict* summer vacation), fans are desperate for action. But here‚Äôs the silver lining: The **Lions and Heroes are both battle-tested**. Samsung‚Äôs recent **11-game winning streak** (led by Fonseca‚Äôs circus-level pitching) has them smelling playoff contention, while Kiwoom‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistent performance‚Äù is code for ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt lose *too* badly.‚Äù

A fun fact: **KT Wiz‚Äôs last-minute starter swap** (Won-seok Oh for‚Ä¶ another Won-seok Oh? Is this a typo or a *meta* joke?) proves that the KBO‚Äôs coaching staffs treat lineups like a Rubik‚Äôs Cube. But let‚Äôs not get d

The true grit of a late-night bar is sharp. You work long. You push tickets. You taste the whole list. You learn what hangs in a pour. Then you meet Amari. They hold a world in one glass. They bite back. They give relief. They make a shift feel new.

Amaro means bitter in Italian. It covers a range of herbal liqueurs that combine sweet and bitter notes. For chefs and bar managers, this is a tool, not a toy. A tool to deepen your menu. A tool to drive guest checks. You need to know the patterns and the rules that don‚Äôt feel like rules.

Aperitivo Amari is the first call. Campari is the icon. It arrived in 1860 and has an ABV of 24 percent¬≤. It glows red in a Negroni. It wakes the room when you build a spritz. Aperol came in 1919. It has 11 percent ABV and a soft bite¬π. It slides across trays with fizz and orange. These two set the tone for your front of house.

Fernet Amari represents a subcategory of amaro, with Fernet-Branca as the most iconic example. Born in 1845¬≥, it smells of camphor and tastes of myrrh. It sinks into the long pull and heals the burn of a long night. Other Fernet examples include Luxardo Fernet. These bottles beg for coffee and last calls.

Light and medium Amari bridge the gap from sweet vermouth to full bitter. Montenegro is widely regarded as the gateway. It started in 1885 and uses 40 herbs and spices‚Å¥. Nonino came later with grappa roots. Averna traces back to 1868 and stands on lemon and pomegranate notes¬π. These are the tools for the craft cocktail wave in your restaurant.

Carciofo Amari brings artichoke to the task. Cynar led the line in 1952‚Åµ. While historically marketed with digestive benefits, this is more a nod to its branding than proven health science. It grinds flavor into a dark body. It mixes in a stout pour or stands neat when you need a moment of calm.

Alpine Amari carries the notes of high places. Braulio was born in 1875¬≤. It tastes of pine and menthol. It chills the palate like a mountain breeze. You serve it straight or with soda when the heat torments your patio service.

Rabarbaro Amari uses dried rhubarb roots and smoke to cut through the swirl. Zucca and Cappelletti versions line the back bar. They anchor late shift hours with fire in their flesh.

Vino Amari rides in on wine, not grain. Cardamaro uses Moscato vines. It tastes like a red vermouth with bitter bones. It slips into a Negroni or a Manhattan with ease.

The task of a restaurant leader is to know these types and to decide where they earn their keep. You can build a tasting flight that feels like an event. You can train staff on why Montenegro is not Fernet. You can teach a chef how to cook with amaro in glazes or pan sauces. The bitter world of Amari is not a trend. It is age-old. It is now.

If you aim to lift your bar game, you must aim at the Amari shelf. Then you must learn each bottle and each style. You must build a system for when to pour neat and when to mix deep. If your post service feels like repetition and fatigue, you need a shot of a new spirit.

Amari will not let your job get stale. They demand you press further. They teach you to see the rim of a glass as a map, not a limit. And they repay your work with a measure of depth that no simple spirit can yield.

Bear the grit of your kitchen in mind. Bring the tact of your service to the bar. Then pour a true Italian bitter. Watch how a diner‚Äôs eyes shift in that first sip. That is the moment you own.

The delivery itself went well (I say well but anyone who has given birth will know that ‚Äòwell‚Äô still means a bit of a nightmare) but the problem I‚Äôm having is with my husband (31M).

After I gave birth (and had a bit to collect myself) I was holding our baby, my husband stared and looked at him, not exactly happy but more in a kind of shocked state which I figured was fairly normal. He held the baby for a bit and stuff after. Admittedly, a ‚Äòwell done‚Äô or a ‚Äòhow are you holding up‚Äô would‚Äôve been nice, or even if he just offered to grab me a snack from the shop across the road. He just held the baby for a bit and commented on things like ‚Äòoh, he‚Äôs got blue eyes like me‚Äô type stuff. He seemed pretty unbothered about the whole thing which I found extremely weird and slightly upset by. Still, I figured just shock.

Next morning (I went into your late at night) I started texting friends and family, sending photos of the baby, etc. and I was having a text conversation with one of my friends (29M) about it, he asked me how I was doing, said he was very happy for me, asked about names, even offered to drop me off like, a coffee and a pastry or something because he would be on his way to work in a couple hours and could easily make a stop at the hospital, y‚Äôknow, just the normal things someone does when someone they care for has given birth right?

My husband asked me who I was texting, and when I told him it who it was he got irritated quickly, asking to see our messages, I let him, and he said that the baby and how I was doing was none of his business. And when I asked why he spewed out the whole ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like my wife having make friends‚Äô thing which I thought we got over ages ago? (He said things like this early in our relationship but I was not willing to give up a lot of my male friends and saw it as a bit of a red flag so I made it an ultimatum, he said I could be friends with who I wanted and we‚Äôve been fine since then).

I‚Äôll stress that these all seemed to be normal questions someone asks and a nice favour- I know I‚Äôd do the same if someone I knew had a baby.

Even when I try to see things from my husband‚Äôs perspective of him trying to make a move or something- it makes no sense as to why now, especially seeing as he‚Äôs engaged to a man! 

Me and my husband went back and forth a bit and I asked him to leave, I was already tired and I wanted the baby to be able to get some sleep too, he hasn‚Äôt come back since although we‚Äôve called and texted (not bringing up what happened).

I never spotted any red flags aside from the one I mentioned (which I thought we felt with). I love him and he loves me. I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve missed something glaring here.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KT Wiz vs. Hanwha Eagles: The ""Same Name, Different Game"" Parlay Special**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a KBO clash that‚Äôs equal parts baseball and *Twilight Zone*. The KT Wiz (home) face the Hanwha Eagles (away) on July 18, and the odds are as confusing as a Korean drama subplot. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a radar gun and the humor of a ballpark hot dog vendor who‚Äôs seen it all.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two ""Won-seok Oh""s

The KT Wiz have made a last-minute starter swap, replacing one *Won-seok Oh* with‚Ä¶ another *Won-seok Oh*. Yes, the KBO‚Äôs version of ‚Äúsame song, second verse‚Äù is here. The new Oh is a 10-win season pitcher, while Hanwha counters with Cody Fonseca, an 11-game winning streak ace. It‚Äôs like two magicians named ‚ÄúBob‚Äù duking it out in a hat factory.

**Key Stats:**

* **Hanwha Eagles (-150 implied probability):** Fonseca‚Äôs 11-game win streak is longer than my patience for explaining why the moon has phases. Their team ERA is‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs not a number you‚Äôd use to calculate your mortgage.
* **KT Wiz (+225):** Their 10-win Oh is like a reliable coffee maker‚Äîconsistent, but not exactly brewing espresso-level excitement.
* **Totals:** The Over/Under is 7.5 runs. If these pitchers keep it under 8, it‚Äôll be quieter than a library where even the librarian is napping.

---

### 2. Digest the News: ‚ÄúSame Name, Different Game‚Äù Edition

KT‚Äôs decision to replace one Won-seok Oh with another is either a masterstroke or a prank pulled by a mischievous GM. Imagine the confusion: ‚ÄúWhich Oh is throwing today? The one who won 10 games or the one who just‚Ä¶ exists?‚Äù Meanwhile, Hanwha‚Äôs Fonseca is on a streak so long, it‚Äôs been documented in hieroglyphics.

**Recent Team News:**

* **Hanwha Eagles:** Their lineup is a buffet of sluggers, but Fonseca‚Äôs dominance makes them look like a Michelin-starred chef at a hot dog stand.
* **KT Wiz:** Their offense has the consistency of a broken metronome‚Äîsometimes there, sometimes not. But hey, their pitcher‚Äôs name is a palindrome. That‚Äôs gotta count for something.

The delivery itself went well (I say well but anyone who has given birth will know that ‚Äòwell‚Äô still means a bit of a nightmare) but the problem I‚Äôm having is with my husband (31M).

After I gave birth (and had a bit to collect myself) I was holding our baby, my husband stared and looked at him, not exactly happy but more in a kind of shocked state which I figured was fairly normal. He held the baby for a bit and stuff after. Admittedly, a ‚Äòwell done‚Äô or a ‚Äòhow are you holding up‚Äô would‚Äôve been nice, or even if he just offered to grab me a snack from the shop across the road. He just held the baby for a bit and commented on things like ‚Äòoh, he‚Äôs got blue eyes like me‚Äô type stuff. He seemed pretty unbothered about the whole thing which I found extremely weird and slightly upset by. Still, I figured just shock.

Next morning (I went into labour late at night) I started texting friends and family, sending photos of the baby, etc. and I was having a text conversation with one of my friends (29M) about it, he asked me how I was doing, said he was very happy for me, asked about names, even offered to drop me off like, a coffee and a pastry or something because he would be on his way to work in a couple hours and could easily make a stop at the hospital, y‚Äôknow, just the normal things someone does when someone they care for has given birth right?

My husband asked me who I was texting, and when I told him it who it was he got irritated quickly, asking to see our messages, I let him, and he said that the baby and how I was doing was none of his business. And when I asked why he spewed out the whole ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like my wife having make friends‚Äô thing which I thought we got over ages ago? (He said things like this early in our relationship but I was not willing to give up a lot of my male friends and saw it as a bit of a red flag so I made it an ultimatum, he said I could be friends with who I wanted and we‚Äôve been fine since then).

I‚Äôll stress that these all seemed to be normal questions someone asks and a nice favour- I know I‚Äôd do the same if someone I knew had a baby.

Even when I try to see things from my husband‚Äôs perspective of him trying to make a move or something- it makes no sense as to why now, especially seeing as he‚Äôs engaged to a man! 

Me and my husband went back and forth a bit and I asked him to leave, I was already tired and I wanted the baby to be able to get some sleep too, he hasn‚Äôt come back since although we‚Äôve called and texted (not bringing up what happened).

I never spotted any red flags aside from the one I mentioned (which I thought we delt with). I love him and he loves me. I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve missed something glaring here.

It doesn‚Äôt let you change server locations manually though, which feels kind of limiting. I think it just routes you through the fastest available one near you.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**:  Boyfriend slid into a girl's DM and seems to have boundary issues with not knowing what flirting looks like, and I'm not sure if we should move in?","I‚Äôm 31F and my boyfriend is 29M. We‚Äôve been together for 3 years and we‚Äôre serious‚Äîthis summer, we‚Äôre supposed to move in together. But something from his past is making me uncomfortable and question how he handles boundaries with women.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Timeline: When he was dating his ex (let‚Äôs call her Kate), her best friend was Amy. During a fight‚Äîwhen Kate gave him the silent treatment‚Äîhe reached out to Amy to ‚Äúcheck on Kate.‚Äù Kate later found out and confronted Amy while they were still together, saying it wasn‚Äôt okay. According to Amy, Kate even said: ‚ÄúIf you two are so good together, why don‚Äôt you just date?‚Äù

After the breakup: During COVID, Amy was posting about being mistreated by her mom. My boyfriend (let‚Äôs call him Daniel) slid into her DMs to ‚Äúcheck in,‚Äù and they reconnected. He later helped Amy move from DC to New York City. Amy‚Äôs mom gave him a TV and started calling him her ‚Äúson.‚Äù

They weren‚Äôt close after that, but stayed in contact: He‚Äôd reach out to Amy when visiting NYC and meet up at a coffee shop. Amy would reach out when she was in DC.

‚∏ª

The dinner:

Recently, I had dinner with Amy, and it was extremely uncomfortable: She touched Daniel‚Äôs arm repeatedly. She said (verbatim): ‚ÄúWe used to wrestle in my apartment. You wouldn‚Äôt win‚Äîeven if I‚Äôm only 95 pounds.‚Äù It felt sexually suggestive and inappropriate. She brought up personal facts about him (like how he used to shave his head). She called Kate ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù, and spoke very disrespectfully about her‚Äîdespite once being her best friend. She also said Daniel had been hurt by Kate, framing herself as someone who understood him better.

Daniel didn‚Äôt say anything to stop this or set any boundaries. He just awkwardly laughed.

When I brought it up afterward, Daniel said they didn‚Äôt wrestle‚Äîshe pushed him once, but that was it. He said he was just trying to be polite and didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward. He previously called her a gold digger and he said he only wanted me to meet her because she‚Äôs a ‚Äúrelic‚Äù from his past and his friendship with her is like ‚Äúwatching the Titanic sink‚Äù‚Äîbecause she had a fake British accent and constantly made a spectacle of herself with superficial name dropping convos.

Despite all of this, he kept seeing her occasionally when in NYC, and I only found out the full extent of their history after I asked.

‚∏ª

TL;DR:

My boyfriend (29M) and I (31F) have been together for 3 years and are supposed to move in together this summer. Years ago, during his previous relationship, he reached out to his ex‚Äôs best friend, Amy, during a fight. After the breakup, he slid into Amy‚Äôs DMs, helped her move cities, and stayed in occasional contact with her. I recently met Amy and she behaved inappropriately‚Äîtouching him, saying they used to ‚Äúwrestle,‚Äù trash-talking his ex, and suggesting he was emotionally wounded. He didn‚Äôt shut any of it down. When I brought it up, he brushed it off and said they never wrestled‚Äîshe just ‚Äúpushed him once.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm ignoring bigger red flags about boundaries and judgment.

‚Äî‚Äî

Does it seem like my boyfriend has poor boundaries, or is this just awkward history he failed to clean up?

Should I be concerned that he didn‚Äôt push back or speak up when Amy disrespected his ex and acted inappropriately in front of me?

Is it a red flag that he downplayed their history and only gave me full context when I asked directly?

Am I over analyzing this? üòÖ",0,1752784050.0,relationships,6,0.5,False

1m2icwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m2icwy/aitah_for_temporarily_moving_out_with_my_kids_bc/,AITAH for temporarily moving out with my kids bc my husband won't respect boundaries with MIL?,"Hi everyone, so for context me and my husband have 3 kids aged 5, 3 and 2, and I'm pregnant with twins. My MIL lives close by, think 15-20 minutes max. For a while we would always send our kids over to spend time with her when we needed to get out the house. 

However recently, we've realized her house is becoming a less safe environment for our kids. She started refusing to put stuff away and baby proof, saying our kids we're too old for her to have to do that stuff. Last time I was over there there were scissors on the coffee table, glass figurines, lots of wires and cords everywhere, just a whole lot of safety hazards. Not a biggie if she was watching them constantly, so we let it slide. 

Then, MIL's dog, (a doberman mix) that was supposed to be locked in the other room during visits, bit our (then) one year old hard on the arm and MIL didn't inform us until we came to pick him up, and he was crying. We took him to the hospital to make sure he didn't need stitches or anything on it. he ended up being fine with only some topical gel and large bandaid. But the fact MIL didn't do anything like that herself was jarring to me. After that we stopped letting them go over there at all. 

It's been a year since that incident, and I decided to fly out for a day to meet my sisters new baby with my husband. We let the kids stay at her place for the first time in a while. It went well and we decided to start allowing regular visits again. (Also bc the dog passed away and is no longer a danger, he was sweet but he couldn't be trusted with kids) 

We found out after about 5 visits, that she was regularly having her boyfriend/s over there while the kids were there, and taking our kids to her house while we we're out and she was meant to be babysitting at ours. We asked her multiple times not to until one day our oldest came home and said he felt uncomfortable around her boyfriend. That's when I drew the line and said no more visits without us there. My husband was upset saying it's not fair to permanently keep them away. 

Here's where it actually started. 

A few days ago, MIL was asked to babysit at our place while me and my husband went to an appointment. So while you're gone my MIL texted my husband and asked, is it ok if I take the kids to my house and we're just gonna chill there instead, and my husband texted back and said, sure just get them home by 3 when we get home. Keep in mind, he didn't tell me anything, I was literally getting an ultrasound, and he just texted her back and was like, yes, you can take them. Even though we've had this conversation many times that they can't go.

 So anyway, when we're on the way back, I guess he gets a text from my mother in law and it comes on to the car that were driving through Bluetooth, so I read the text, and it's like, oh, running a little bit late back to the house. So I asked, oh, whered they go like did they get ice cream or something. And he says, no, I let her take the kids to her house. So pretty much it turns into like this whole big fight because honestly, I felt really disrespected. Anyway, when we get home we go inside and her boyfriends there. This is the same guy that my kid was like, I feel uncomfortable around, and we told her that we didn't want him, or any other strangers around our kids, so the fact that she had the audacity to bring him into our house, is like what? So yeah, I was really mad at her, and I started screaming at her. I told her she was a shitty person for bringing in a stranger that my kid feels uncomfortable around into my house. Then I yelled at my husband for not telling me and explaining to me that he was sending our kids off with someone that I told him I didn't trust and that we both agreed on that would not be allowed near our kids at her house. I feel so betrayed and disrespected honestly. My husband was yelling and screaming at me, saying that that's his mom, and that was being unfair and unreasonable, and that she has a right to seeing these kids, and then my mother-in-law backed him up and saying, yeah, these are my grandkids, I have a right to see them, you can't keep them away from me, and I was yelling and saying,  this was kidnapping, I didn't say you could take the kids anywhere, and I told you they're not allowed at your house, and you brought them there. 

So basically, she left, her boyfriend left, and I packed up me and my kids things, and I drove the 5 hour drive to my other sisters house, and that's where I've been for the past few days because I need a break.

Am I overreacting? I feel like someone should have told me that the kids were going there and he tried to keep this a secret from me which makes it worse. I've been in contact with him in like texting him and calling him so we can try and work smth out, but he's not backing down, but I am also not backing down. MIL's boyfriend gives major creep vibes too. 

Also my husband screamed at me over this and said not to come back if im going to alienate his mother. I feel awful because it wasn't my intention I just don't want. My kids around some stranger that makes them uncomfortable and a woman who doesn't properly watch them. He also sent a text saying

""You and those little asshats can stay away if your like this to my mother. I can send them wherever I want. (MIL's bf's name) is a good guy, Sage (our son) is making stuff up he's a baby. I want to work things out but you need to respect my mother. ""

Idek. He's never like this and I'm shocked. 

AITAH? 

ETA: I screen shotted and documented each of the texts and incidents. I responded to his text saying

""Your defending the guy who is trying to SA your child just because he's with your mom. These kids are not asshats, maybe you need to do some work on yourself if you want to see them again. You mean a lot to me but the safety of our children means more. Talk soon"" 

He responded telling me to grow up and ""come the fuck home immediately with my kids or else there will be issues."" He also said he's going to show up and to have the kids ready, so I called my brother to come over just for peace of mind.

1m2icno,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m2icno/explore_if_the_poliviar_french_press_coffee_maker/,Explore if the Poliviar French Press Coffee Maker is the perfect brew upgrade!,"The **POLIVIAR 7379 JX2020-FPN-US French Press Coffee Maker** has been my trusty companion for home brewing over the past few weeks, and as someone who can't start the day without the perfect cup of coffee, I‚Äôve thoroughly put it to the test. It‚Äôs not just a coffee maker; it‚Äôs one of those products that brings a touch of functionality and modernity into your kitchen. While I‚Äôm quite satisfied with this French press‚Äôs overall performance, it‚Äôs important to highlight the aspects that stood out‚Äîand those that fell short.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
I have to say, this French press stands out with its sleek, flatland green design and real wood ergonomic handle. The first thing I noticed was how well the color complemented my kitchen‚Äôs earthy tones, adding a clean and understated elegance to my countertop. Unlike other stainless steel models I‚Äôve used, the polished coating feels more premium and well-crafted. The double-wall construction has an impressive heft, hinting at durability, while its food-grade stainless steel ensures it‚Äôs safe for brewing. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúcheap‚Äù vibe to this, and I appreciate that commitment to quality. Plus, the wooden handle doesn‚Äôt just look good‚Äîit‚Äôs comfortable and stays cool to the touch, which is a thoughtful design choice.

**Performance and Usability**  
Using this coffee maker has been a breeze, thanks to its manual operation. I‚Äôve often found electric coffee makers too fussy or prone to breaking down, so the simplicity of manual brewing speaks to me. The highlight for me here is the dual-filter screen system, which truly lives up to the promise of keeping sediment out while preserving those aromatic coffee oils. Every sip has that smooth, rich flavor that French press enthusiasts like me crave. I‚Äôve tested this with both coarse and medium grounds, and the smoothness of the brew consistently impressed me. All the parts, including the filter, assemble and disassemble quite easily, making cleaning straightforward.

**[Check POLIVIAR 7379 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b08fbtgjrf/)**

**Heat Retention and Insulation**  
One of the biggest perks of this French press over glass options is its double-wall insulation design. I‚Äôve had mornings where I brewed a batch and left it on the counter while tackling other tasks. Even after about an hour, the coffee stayed hot‚Äîa rarity for me with other coffee makers! It‚Äôs claimed to keep beverages hot four times as long as glass, and while I didn‚Äôt scientifically measure it, my experience would agree with that statement. Plus, the exterior never gets overly hot, so there‚Äôs no need to worry about accidental burns when handling it.

**Key Benefits**  
- Features double-wall insulation to keep coffee hot for extended periods.  
- Real wood handle with ergonomic grip.  
- Durable, food-grade stainless steel construction.  
- Dual-filter design ensures smooth coffee without sediment.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The product weighs 2.12 pounds, which might feel heavy to some users.  
- The included filter could require extra effort to clean thoroughly.  
- A bit pricier compared to basic French presses, which might not suit budget-conscious buyers.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the POLIVIAR option with other French press coffee makers, like the Bodum Chambord and Espro P3, there are clear differences in appeal. The Bodum Chambord, while classic in design, lacks the insulation this one offers, making it less ideal for brewing over time. The Espro P3, on the other hand, brings a similarly smooth brewing experience with its dual-filter technology, but it compromises on design elegance and material sturdiness. If durability is a top priority, the POLIVIAR French press holds its own‚Äîit‚Äôs resistant to rust and wear, something I can‚Äôt confidently say about all competitors.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
When evaluating this coffee maker‚Äôs price point, it may not be the cheapest option, but considering its durability, heat retention, and flavor-preserving features, it offers excellent value. If you‚Äôre the type looking for something long-lasting and stylishly functional in your kitchen, the investment feels justified. There might be cheaper models out there, but you‚Äôd likely compromise on build quality and heat retention. Whether you‚Äôre an avid coffee drinker like me or buying it as a gift for a coffee enthusiast, this feels like it‚Äôs worth every dollar spent.

I‚Äôm currently making the trek from Los Angeles to Chicago. I‚Äôve done this trip before, but I took Route 66 that time, for the hell of it. This time, I opted to take the interstates, a shorter ride and a way I haven‚Äôt taken before. This way cuts through the middle of the country, passing through Colorado and Nebraska and Iowa.¬†

The drive was going normal. Lots of nothingness ‚Äî again, I‚Äôm used to going hours without seeing any other cars, or people, when I‚Äôm driving out here.¬†

By the time I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôve been driving for close to 3 days. Last night I slept in a Walmart parking lot somewhere in Colorado, I think Frisco? I drove for over 14 hours straight yesterday, only stopping a couple of times at gas stations to grab snacks, take a piss, and refuel. I grabbed dinner at a Taco Bell at like midnight before I crashed.¬†

I‚Äôm recounting every detail because I‚Äôm hoping that, maybe, this whole thing could be explained away by a lack of sleep and nutrition. I know I should be eating and sleeping more, but I just don‚Äôt think about it when I‚Äôm on the road. I don‚Äôt think about anything. That‚Äôs why I love these trips so much.¬†

Anyways, I woke up this morning at the crack of dawn (like 6 a.m. in Colorado, which is 5 a.m. my time) and continued on my way. I wanted to make good time ‚Äî not for any reason, it‚Äôs not like I had plans, I just wanted to see how quickly I could drive so far.¬†

I grabbed breakfast at a local cafe (a bagel and a coffee), filled up on gas, grabbed some Red Bulls, some beef jerky, and a gallon of water. Then I headed out.¬†

I don‚Äôt think I stopped driving until like 6 hours in, when I realized I was gonna piss myself from all the energy drinks I chugged (I tend to space out until it‚Äôs nearly too late). I stopped at the first gas station I saw ‚Äî 2 measly gas pumps and a run-down, old wooden shack for a convenience store. I was somewhere coming up on Kearney, Nebraska and I had endured yet another time change, so it was now around 2 p.m.

I walked inside and the bell on the door jingled. The man at the cash register jumped slightly ‚Äî startled by the first sign of life other than his own cigarette-soaked breaths.¬†

I asked him if they had a restroom and he grinned. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bucket out back, Princess.‚Äù He said, stifling a chuckle.¬†

I stared at him blankly, waiting for a punchline. He sighed and handed me a tarnished key attached to a piece of wood, which had been roughly etched with ‚ÄúPISSER.‚Äù¬†

He pointed to a door at the far end of the shack. I did my business ‚Äî though the toilet looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned since before I was born ‚Äî and returned the key to the man at the register, who I now noticed had a name tag that read ‚ÄúGUS.‚Äù

I turned to leave, but before I could, Gus cleared his throat and asked me, ‚ÄúWhere ya headed?‚Äù I told him Chicago, and he said, ‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt really know. ‚ÄúJust to go, I guess.‚Äù

His eyes lingered on me a moment, almost an uncomfortable amount of time. Then, he quickly glanced about the shack before he said, ‚ÄúWell, if you can spare a couple hours, I know of a bitchin‚Äô scenic route through the peaks a bit further north.‚Äù

He went on to tell me that this route was only really known to locals, winding through Nebraskan ‚Äúpeaks‚Äù (really just short hills, but for a Nebraskan, that‚Äôs a peak) with plenty of lookouts over‚Ä¶ whatever the hell is in Nebraska. Historically home to booze-filled high school parties, romantic illegal camping rendezvous, and, of course, it‚Äôs fair share of local folklore legends, like the classic, ‚Äúteen lovers murdered during a make-out sesh and the killer was never caught,‚Äù type shit.¬†

It‚Äôs not like his story really piqued my interest; it‚Äôs the same shit you hear about every random ‚Äúscenic route‚Äù and ‚Äúlookout‚Äù in every random small town. But that‚Äôs exactly why I chose to embark upon Gus‚Äô route.¬†

I‚Äôm always so curious to explore the places that locals know and adore in all of the random small towns I wind up in along my travels. It makes me realize how connected we really are ‚Äî no matter where we are in the world, we live out these parallel lives. Experiencing emotions and struggles that so many other people also experience, in their own ways. I love finding these spots. I love feeling connected with something, anything.¬†

He gave me crude directions, but it seemed simple enough. Continue up Interstate 80 for an hour or two longer until I see a turnoff, a dirt road to my left, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù that‚Äôll take me where I ‚Äúneed to go,‚Äù according to Gus.¬†

I figured that if I didn‚Äôt see the turnoff, I‚Äôd just take the loss.¬†

After our conversation, I decided to purchase some snacks (Sour Patch Kids, Cheez-its, and 2 more Red Bulls) and a pack of menthol cigarettes. I filled up on gas again before leaving ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt sure when the next gas station would be, especially if I found Gus‚Äô route ‚Äî and I continued on my way.¬†

I lit a cigarette as I began this next leg of my journey. My mother would kill me for smoking in my car. She‚Äôd kill me for a lot of the shit I do when I take these trips.¬†

One thing I started to learn is that Nebraska is full of corn and wheat, and not much else. In all directions, all I could see were miles and miles of farmland. Stalks waving in the wind like a sorry excuse for an ocean.¬†

Interstate 80 was surrounded, crops creeping onto the shoulders of the road, refusing to adhere to any man-made perimeters. The stalks grew high above my SUV, making it so I could see nothing beyond the confines of my wheaty, corny prison.¬†

I had been driving for about two hours since the gas station when I saw it ‚Äî a break in the crops to my left. Gus was right, I couldn‚Äôt miss it. The dirt road stood out like a beacon: a sudden relief from my engulfment.¬†

I didn‚Äôt feel any hesitation to take the path. In fact, I was excited that I had actually stumbled across it. As I made the turn, I could almost feel the stories, the experiences of the people who had made this turn before me.¬†

Every local has their spots. In every big city, every small town, every single person has a place that is special to them. A coffee shop, a hiking trail, a park. Somewhere they have left pieces of themselves. I want to leave pieces of myself everywhere.

The dirt road cut through the fields, heading north. Far ahead of me, I could see a small range of hills ‚Äî nothing compared to California‚Äôs mountain ranges, but at least it wasn‚Äôt flat, like everywhere else is out here.¬†

After driving through more and more miles of farmland, eventually I started to ascend. The road curved to my right at the base of the closest hill, and turned from dirt into old, battered pavement. I began a twisty-turny ride up and up.¬†

As I got higher up the hill, I could see what Gus was talking about ‚Äî the views were incredible. Plots of farmland, a quilt that covered the Earth in greens and tans and yellows. I lit another cigarette and slowly continued my drive.¬†

I stopped at a couple of lookouts, just random turnoffs on the side of the road, taking in my surroundings. You can find beauty in anything if you try, even Nebraskan wheat fields. I felt like a local.¬†

The road was nothing special. Similar to most mountain roads I‚Äôve taken before. Nothing stood out, really, besides some empty bottles and beer cans in the brush. I didn‚Äôt see a single other person for the entirety of my drive, which I enjoyed. It was just me and the plants and the road.

Then I entered the tunnel.¬†

I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Especially coming from California, plenty of mountain roads cut through portions of the mountain itself, causing you to drive through a manufactured hole in the rock. I used to play a game as a kid where I‚Äôd hold my breath until we made it through to the other side. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt try to hold my breath this time.¬†

I immediately noticed the tunnel was long, which was surprising to me. I doubted the hill was that large across, but I couldn‚Äôt see any light coming from the other end. The dirty orange bulbs hanging from the ceiling every 10 feet or so didn‚Äôt make much of a difference in the pitch-black.¬†

I drove for about 30 mins, thinking to myself that this may be the longest tunnel I‚Äôve ever driven through. Then the lights started diminishing. They began popping up every 30 feet. Then every 50 feet. Then every 100 feet. Then there were none.¬†

I drove through the darkness for another 45 minutes, my headlights leading the way. I‚Äôd been in the tunnel for over an hour now, it was close to 8 p.m., and I didn‚Äôt see any signs of the exit.¬†

I decided to turn around. I didn‚Äôt like being swallowed by darkness. The rock walls were closing in on me, reigniting my claustrophobic fears that consumed me as a child.

I drove for an hour or so back the direction I came. The lights should have started coming back by now ‚Äî but they didn‚Äôt. No orange bulbs.

I drove for another hour. and another. Almost 3 hours driving back the way I came, and I never made it back to the tunnel‚Äôs entrance. I was never greeted by the warm glow of the dim bulbs.¬†

Maybe the lights had gone out? But even then, I should have been out of the tunnel hours ago by now. I started getting worried.¬†

I was confused. I *had* turned around, hadn‚Äôt I? I remembered taking that 3-point U-turn in the narrow tunnel; I had been worried my SUV wouldn‚Äôt even be able to make the turn, and was relieved when it had.

I grabbed my phone but of course, no service. And who would I even call? My angry mother, who would just chew me out for listening to a strange man at a gas station in the first place? I have no friends back home, I‚Äôm more inclined to spend my time alone. No relationships, besides an ex who wants me dead. I‚Äôve only had myself for as long as I can remember.¬†

I left on this trip without telling anyone I was leaving, let alone where I‚Äôd be. Would anyone even notice I was lost? My mind was racing, looking for a solution as I kept driving.¬†

Luckily my car is good on gas. I was still at half a tank. I just kept going ‚Äî what else was I supposed to do?

After another 2 hours, I was desperate. My gas wouldn‚Äôt last forever, it was dwindling fast, and when my car gave out I wouldn‚Äôt be able to charge my phone, either. My only distraction from the void enveloping me was my downloaded Spotify playlists. I needed that to survive. I needed that so I didn‚Äôt go crazy in here.

Out of nowhere, while I was fiddling with my music, I saw a beacon of hope. One single bar; it popped up for a split second. I slammed on my brakes and reversed until I got back to the sweet spot.¬†

At this point, I didn‚Äôt care if my mother screamed at me so loud it damaged my phone‚Äôs speaker. I needed to tell someone what was happening to me.¬†

I hovered over her contact for a few seconds before I sighed and clicked ‚Äúcall.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt even ring. Just a horrific beeping that signified no service.¬†

I rested my forehead on the steering wheel, tears starting to well. I wasn‚Äôt going to get stuck out here. I couldn‚Äôt. My brain wouldn‚Äôt even consider that an option.¬†

I grabbed my phone and got out of the car. An eerie whistling from the wind blowing through the tunnel filled my ears. I climbed on top of my car. Maybe if I stood up here, I could get a call out.¬†

It didn‚Äôt work. The same disheartening beeping rang out over and over, and I groaned. I could feel the anxiety building, my heart pounding against my chest.¬†

Then, I heard something. It was faint at first, like someone trying to stifle a cough. I thought I imagined it. I stood there, listening.¬†

Then it happened again, louder. It sounded like a playful shout, like maybe a teenager exploring the tunnel, hooting and hollering with their friends. This is what my mind latched on to; another sign of life meant I could get out of here.

I shouted back, ‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù¬†

It echoed, bouncing off the cold rock walls, repeating over and over.¬†

Then, it was uncannily quiet. The wind‚Äôs whistling stopped and everything went still. All I could hear were my own panicked breaths.¬†

Then, footsteps. Hundreds of them.¬†

Running, thumping footsteps, coming from both directions. It shook the ground and made my car wobble. Pebbles tumbled off the walls.

I have never felt so weak, so exposed. I damn near broke a bone jumping off of the roof of my car and stumbling into my driver‚Äôs seat at what felt like the speed of light. I slammed the car door and locked it. I laid my seat all the way back and pressed myself against it, wanting so badly to dissolve, to disappear.¬†

My car stopped swaying. The quiet returned.¬†

I laid there for what must have been an hour, maybe more. Tears caked my face and I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. I tried every breathing exercise my therapist had taught me. Nothing could calm me.¬†

What the actual fuck was that?

I haven‚Äôt moved. I‚Äôm still laying in my driver‚Äôs seat, typing this. It‚Äôs almost 4 a.m. I have been in this tunnel for almost 10 hours. I thought that maybe if I sat down and wrote out everything that‚Äôs happened so far, it would help me understand. I still don‚Äôt understand, but it is helping me to settle down. It‚Äôs grounding me in my reality.¬†

Can someone please figure out where I am? Can someone tell me what‚Äôs happening?

How does a tunnel suddenly extend by miles? Did Gus know about this? Is that why he sent me here? I‚Äôm paranoid.

What do I do from here? I don‚Äôt want to get out of my car again. What if they find me? Why did they stop running to me? Did I imagine it, in my hungry, exhausted state?

I don‚Äôt think continuing to drive is a good option, but it‚Äôs really the only option. Eventually my gas is going to run out. Eventually my phone is going to die for good. Eventually, I will starve or die of dehydration. I‚Äôm conserving the little food and drink I have as much as I can.¬†

I‚Äôm freaking out. I‚Äôm so thankful I bought these cigarettes.¬†

If anyone has any idea how I can get out of this, please tell me. I‚Äôll try anything.¬†

If anything else happens in here, I‚Äôll keep you updated. I pray to God this single bar allows this post.



**PART 2**

Hi, I‚Äôm still alive. Still in this godforsaken, dreary place.¬†

Thank you to everyone who replied to my post with advice, theories, anything. It‚Äôs helping me feel less alone, reading and answering your comments.¬†

One thing that you guys suggested was that Gus may have laced something that I consumed ‚Äî the snacks, the Red Bulls, the cigarettes ‚Äî and as scary as that would be, I was praying for that to be the case. I was holding on to hope that I would wake up today somewhere else. That this whole thing would be a hallucination, brought on by some Nebraskan hick‚Äôs psychedelics.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt.¬†

I fell asleep at like 8 this morning, kept awake all night by gripping fear. I woke up at 4 p.m. with a start, unsure if my terror was from something real or something I dreamed.¬†

Honestly, I usually awaken with a start. I have had chronic nightmares for as long as I can remember. I don‚Äôt think my trepidation was caused by an outside force.¬†

Still in the tunnel, feeling the same as I did yesterday. I don‚Äôt think I was laced.¬†

Another response I kept seeing on my first post was that turning around was a mistake. If we take what Gus said literally, as many of you are, I have to continue through the tunnel to take me where I ‚Äúneed to go.‚Äù¬†

Maybe that‚Äôs why the tunnel extended, keeping me inside until I turned back around. It wants to trick me. It‚Äôs swallowing me like a pill.¬†

So, when I woke up today, I turned back around. Facing back through the tunnel, hopefully the correct way.¬†

My car was slowly running out of gas. Less than 1/4 tank. I found a portable charger in my car (thank fuck) that I charged up as I drove. I need as much time with you all as I can get; I need to feel like I‚Äôm still connected to civilization.¬†

Every 10-15 miles down the tunnel, I would reach another service sweet spot. A split second of a bar before it disappeared once again. It‚Äôs throwing me a bone.¬†

I watched as my gas sensor conspicuously made its way to ‚ÄúE.‚Äù I kept driving, past empty, for about 30 mins until my car sputtered and came to a stop in the darkness.

I had been driving for about 3 hours. My car stopped near where I had turned around yesterday, I think.

I sat there, unsure of what to do next, even though in my heart and in my mind, I knew. Something I was dreading. I had to start walking.¬†

This must be what it wants ‚Äî for me to be exposed, no longer protected by the steel frame of my SUV, no longer able to hide or speed away at a sign of danger.¬†

I was avoiding giving the tunnel what it wanted. I was terrified that as soon as I stepped out of my vehicle, I would be swarmed by whatever was running at me yesterday. But I had no other choice.¬†

I packed a bag with the necessary supplies. All of my food and drink, my portable charger, a blanket, some warm clothes, and a journal and pen in case my phone dies before I get out of here ‚Äî I still want to be able to document my journey. I also grabbed my emergency flashlight and some extra batteries. I even found an old flare in my car‚Äôs tool bag, which I took with me. And, of course, my cigarettes and a lighter.

I sat there with my packed bag for a while, building up the courage to open my car door.¬†

I took a deep breath, counted down from 10, and on 1, I swung open my door and stepped out onto the road.¬†

The wind‚Äôs eerie whistling surrounded me once again. I pointed my flashlight all around me. It was cold, dark, and damp. Liquid pooled at the base of the rock walls.¬†

There was nothing to do but start walking, so I did. Leaving my precious vehicle behind was heartbreaking; that SUV is the one constant I have in my life right now.¬†

I walked and walked. I knew that the last time I got a bar was about 2 miles before my car stopped. That meant in 8 miles or so, I would hit another sweet spot, and that‚Äôs where I would rest. It would probably take me about 3 hours of walking.¬†

My flashlight did hardly anything in the pitch-black. I could see only about 10 feet in front of me, in only a small circle of light. The air felt heavy. It was getting hard to breathe.¬†

I jumped at every noise: pebbles I had happened to kick bouncing along the ground, water drip-drops, even my own footsteps sometimes.

I was constantly swiveling my light in all directions. Glancing behind me every few seconds, even though I couldn‚Äôt see shit. I felt like I was being watched, as cliche as it is.

I walked for about an hour and a half, telling myself I was halfway to my rest point. I just had to keep pushing.¬†

I stopped for a second to re-tie my shoe laces. As I kneeled down, my flashlight fell out of my pocket and rolled to the other side of the tunnel, light aiming behind me.¬†

I watched the light as it rolled. The flashlight hit the wall opposite me with a metallic ""clink.""

The beam of light illuminated something pressed against the wall, about 10 feet behind me.¬†

A black shadow stood out against the shiny, grey rock. It looked like the shape of a person, though elongated and wrong, somehow. Someone standing with their face pressed against the wall, arms at their side.¬†

I inhaled sharply, trying to act as though I didn‚Äôt see anything. I didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge the shape. We all remember what happened the last time I acknowledged a presence in this tunnel.¬†

I quickly finished tying my shoes and ran across the tunnel to grab my flashlight. I picked it up and continued briskly walking, away from the figure, away from the menacing mass that stuck to the rock like moss.¬†

My heart started racing once again, pounding so hard I worried the sound would echo.¬†

Was I being followed? And by what?

I kept moving; it almost felt like I was floating. My legs were getting numb, from the cold and the trek.¬†

I made it to my rest point without another incident. I put on a sweater and sat on the ground, my back against the tunnel wall, wrapping myself in my blanket. The bar had appeared like a sign from God and I started reading more of your comments, just to hear from someone.

I guess, eventually, I started to hum. It‚Äôs a habit I‚Äôve had since I was younger, a habit that‚Äôs always driven my mother crazy. It‚Äôs always random tunes that I can‚Äôt really place. This time was no different.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt even noticed the melody vibrating in my throat. Not until I heard it, faintly, from my left. Further down the tunnel, the way I had walked from.

I stopped my humming, but the tune didn‚Äôt cease. It kept repeating, and I grew more restless each time.

A panic crept over me. I listened intently, and realized it didn‚Äôt even necessarily sound human. It sounded forced, like whatever was repeating my humming had never hummed before.¬† Crackling, gritty, hoarse.

Then more joined in. From both directions.¬†

A distorted choir I couldn‚Äôt see was repeating my nonsensical tune over and over.¬†

I started imagining what these pitiful tunnel demons could possibly look like. Did they appear as human, like I thought the shadow was? Or were they more animalistic? Would my death be quick at their hands?

The humming was converging on me, getting closer and closer. I turned off my flashlight and threw my blanket over my head, curling up into a ball, like a toddler avoiding the monster under their bed.¬†

I lay there, with my eyes closed, focusing on my breathing. ‚ÄúIn for 6, hold for 6, out for 6.‚Äù Just like my therapist taught me.¬†

The ground trembled. The pebbles skittered around me. The wind picked up speed.¬†

After about 5 minutes, the humming came to an abrupt halt. Everything quieted, suddenly.

A single set of footsteps was approaching me, slowly.¬†

I was shaking as I heard the figure coming up on me. I remained under my blanket, pressed against the ground and the wall. I scrunched my eyes closed and pictured myself somewhere, anywhere else.¬†

The footsteps stopped right in front of me. I sensed the figure lean down; I could hear it breathing directly above me. If this was it, this was it. I accepted my fate.¬†

Drops of what I assumed was drool splattered onto the blanket. I heard something lick its lips.¬†

I held my breath and thought of every horrible thing I had done throughout my life, and how I would never be able to fix it. How I never made amends with so many of the people I had harmed. How my mother probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice I was dead, and if she did, she‚Äôd probably be relieved.¬†

Obviously, whatever it was didn‚Äôt kill me. It stood there, above me, salivating and clicking its tongue for a long, long time.¬†

Somehow, I fucking fell asleep.¬†

‚ÄúWAKE UP.‚Äù¬†

I was still wrapped in the blanket, clutching my flashlight and my phone. I had been awakened by that harsh whisper-shout that rang in my ears, like when someone screams in a dream and it continues long after you open your eyes.¬†

I listened, but I heard nothing more.¬†

I slowly lifted the edge of the blanket and peaked out. My eyes began adjusting to the darkness, and I couldn‚Äôt see any ominous shapes in my immediate vicinity.¬†

I bit my tongue and turned on my flashlight, slowly lifting the blanket off of myself and shining my light in all directions. Nothing.¬†

Are they toying with me? Maybe they‚Äôre like Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄúIT,‚Äù maybe they want me to be afraid before they eat me so I taste better.¬†

Are they even real? I saw that shape in the tunnel, but maybe it was a trick of the light. I heard the humming and I felt that figure looming over me, but maybe it was all in my head.¬†

My mother always told me I was beyond help. That my paranoid tendencies would take over me until they killed me. Maybe that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs happening now. I keep trying to tell myself that none of this is real, that I‚Äôm just going crazy from hunger and exhaustion and cold and isolation.

It's getting harder to convince myself of that, though. Especially now that I notice the dozen-or-so drops of blood littering my blanket.

I think I slept for like 2 hours ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost 2 a.m. I‚Äôm about to start the 3 hour walk to my next resting point, my next bar. I have to keep moving.

Until I can get back online, I‚Äôm hoping some of you can help me.¬†

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any point in figuring out exactly where I am. I don‚Äôt want anybody else coming in here after me. I don‚Äôt know if this tunnel is even real at this point.

But, maybe you guys can give me some ideas on how to proceed.¬†

Should I confront the figures the next time they make themselves known? Maybe acknowledging them is the only way I can get out of here. Maybe I have to face my fears.¬†

What could they be? Ghosts, souls trapped in this tunnel, waiting for it to capture me next? Demons, monsters, deranged mountain people? Has anyone encountered or heard of something like this before? I have a lot of time to think in here. I've been running through every possible scenario.

Anyways, thanks for being here. Even if you can‚Äôt offer me any guidance, just interacting with me is helping me feel more sane.¬†

Hopefully you hear from me again.

THE JOURNAL OF JUNE SMITHERS¬†

**DAY 4**

Phone died. I think batteries drain faster in here. I don‚Äôt know what time it is. No way to tell.¬†

I didn‚Äôt come across any more service spots after the last post I made anyway.¬†

I am writing in my journal to keep me sane.¬†

I am writing in my journal to keep me sane.¬†

I am not dead yet

I am not dead yet

I am not dead yet

I saw the creatures. Last night after I walked for hours, maybe even days. They were suddenly illuminated by my flashlight in the dark, lining the sides of the tunnel, just watching me. At least I think ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt have eyes. Probably evolved to be rid of them after centuries in the tunnel, maybe?¬†

They hummed my tune again, softly, almost indistinguishable from the whistling of the wind.¬†

They were humanlike, but dark grey, veiny, skinny, tall. Limbs slightly too long. Again, no eyes, and just small holes for a nose and ears.¬†

Where was the mouth?¬†

The Mouth

The Mouth

The Mouth

I walked past them all, backs pressed flat against the tunnel walls with their arms pinned to their sides.

I passed hundreds of them, noticing more and more features. Huge flat feet planted firmly to the ground. Long, sharp fingernails on fingers with at least 5 knuckles.¬†

One on its own, standing in the middle of the tunnel, blocking my path. Its back to me.¬†

I stopped. Should I speak?

I stood there watching it for some time, debating what I should do.¬†

I turned around. All of those things were now facing towards me: leaning, peering around each other. Their humming grew louder.

I looked back to the one standing in front of me. It, too, faced me now. I gasped, overtaken by its putrid gasoline smell and its slimy, featureless face.¬†

Then, its face started‚Ä¶ splitting. Its skin was pulling, ripping apart. Dark blood oozed as its flesh tore.

The Mouth

The Mouth

The Mouth

It opened wide and I looked inside. Look inside. Look inside. Look inside.

I saw everything.¬†

The answer.¬†

**DAY 5**

I am writing in my journal to keep me sane.¬†

I am writing in my journal to keep me sane.

I am writing in my journal to keep me sane.¬†

I‚Äôm going crazy in here. Never-ending darkness, the same tunnel walls, the same puddles and pebbles, the same strange noises echoing through this hollow tomb.¬†

GET ME OUT GET ME OUT

I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve seen too much. That they won‚Äôt let me leave now that I know things.¬†

I know what they are, what I am, what we are. Collective consciousness. Nothing matters, everything is meaningless, or is everything full of meaning?

I‚Äôm not making any sense.¬†

I need to conserve my light.¬†

**DAY 6**

I understand now. I cannot leave. This is where I am meant to be; I ended up here for a reason.¬†

They never wanted to hurt me. They wanted to show me.¬†

I am more than this body, this life. I am more than a lost drifter, constantly searching for meaning, for a place I belong.¬†

I was right; we are all connected. Except we aren‚Äôt living parallel lives ‚Äî we are all living the same life in different universes.

In one universe, we are me, and in another, we are you. We are everyone, all at once.¬†

When I looked inside¬†

The Mouth¬†

The Mouth¬†

The Mouth¬†

I saw everything. I saw every human experience. Everything you‚Äôve ever done, everything anyone‚Äôs ever done. I possess the knowledge that comes with having billions upon billions of life experiences.

All of you have it, too. You just need to look inside. You just need to look inside. You just need to look inside.¬†

Look inside.¬†

**DAY 7**

I walk with them now.¬†

We hum together.¬†

END OF JOURNAL



**Epilogue**

My daughter‚Äôs body was found by a hunter and his two young sons. She was somewhere in a Nebraskan wildlife management area. Poor kids were traumatized.¬†

My daughter was‚Ä¶ troubled. She dealt with paranoid delusions and manic depressive episodes throughout her life. She would often disappear for weeks at a time.¬†

I worried, of course, as any mother would. But I had called the cops to report her missing so many times, just for her to show back up at home a couple weeks later. The cops stopped taking me seriously after the 15th time, and I don‚Äôt blame them.

June, my daughter, was lost. A lonely, sick young woman who wandered the planet like a ghost.¬†

Please don‚Äôt go looking for this ‚Äútunnel‚Äù she was clearly so obsessed with in her final days. There was no goddamn tunnel anywhere near her body. She was found dead in the woods, leaning against a tree. We still have yet to locate her car.

She had gouged out her eyes with her bare hands. She had broken her own jaw, so her mouth hung open wide. Beside her, her journal, with the entries I uploaded here. I figured you all might appreciate the closure these would provide. I didn't want any of you thinking she was still out there, and, God forbid, go looking for her, just to get as lost as she was.

It was only a matter of time.¬†

I‚Äôm just glad that June finally felt connected to something when she passed.¬†

I feel connected, too. Ever since I identified her body at the morgue. Ever since I saw¬†

I have a Profitec Go and Niche Zero, using fresh med/dark beans. 

Ive been on this issue of never getting tasty espresso, I would start slight coarse and then extend the ratio and fine things up but I find I go from sour to 'balanced' but bland and then if I go finer to bring our more flavor it just tastes....odd, I never get like solid coffee taste or go heavy into bitter. I let the machine warm up for like 10-15 min and the PID is saying it's at temp ( Ive even adjusted the E1 offset up to 18 from other thread advice). but can never land tasty espresso. I recently went to a friend with a Brevile and they gave me a shot after almost no warmup time that was solid although a bit bitter and burnt and I realized I was never even get close to pushing the extraction that hard as to get that flavor out.

I had recently left the machine on for over an hour on the weekend cause I got distracted and noticed the shot I pulled, while not dialed, was HOT to touch (like noticeable hotter than normal ) and much different in flavor. Am I just not letting the machine warm enough??? I just ordered some smart plugs to try and turn the machine on an hour before I wake up in morning to see if this helps.

I kinda feel dumb Ive been at this forever and feel Ive been running circles trying to dial in with a cold machine and so confused why following typical dialing advice never quite landed,",1,1752783898.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I've been a long time lurker in r/Excel and its been cool to see some of the formulas that get posted in there. But I can't help but feel like the posts aren't really relatable. Most of the people in that community work in business or accounting whereas I focus more so on HR, training, and logistics.



I've been working on this database that I use to assist with my daily work. It started in MS Access, but somehow I lost the ability to use linked tables for access so I was forced to change tack. I started learning Power BI because people can't shut up about how awesome it is. Pretty easy to learn the basics; looks like Power Query and uses M code for functions. Not really my style though, and the program is clunky and slow for our lowest-bidder type machines. So I went back to Excel and that's when I started to get creative.



Before long my screen was filled with hundreds of XLOOKUP formulas. Then I discovered nested IF statements, SORTBY, FILTER. I learned how to TEXTSPLIT, TEXTJOIN, WRAPROWS, TRANSPOSE, MAKEARRAY. I kicked it into overdrive when I mastered LET functions. I built Ad Hoc BI queries and it has grown to pull data from 5 or 6 other systems (I can't wait until we have API keys and I don't have to pull these reports myself). I got to a data set from one system and I needed to learn about recursion and LAMBDA (still haven't gotten the hang of that yet). I started combining more and more of these filters when I learned about HSTACK and VSTACK. I made custom arrays showing me just the little snippets of data that I needed. One of my formulas is over 100 lines long and I'm starting to learn Python in hopes of taking all of this data and automating tedious parts of my job.



Anyway, I'm proud of my work, but I didn't say all that to flex. I want to know what kind of cool projects you guys have made? I'd love to get some ideas to keep improving my skills and products. Are there any other useful data sets I can get my hands on? Are there any programming languages that will be useful to know? Are there any data science type positions out there?



Shout out to Chief P for showing me Power Query and INDEX(MATCH) when I was an E5. You may have inadvertently put me on the path to becoming a programmer or a data scientist when I get out.

First, I want to thank this forum! People here have inspired me to keep believing ü•π

Yesterday, my natural period came back! After >1.5 yrs of absence!

I had AH for a while. I lost my period working in a stressful ‚Äùlong-hours‚Äù job 2022-2023 (paired with always restricting calories since teen years). My period came back May 2023 when I quit the job.

Then, I had 4 regular bleeds. Until autumn 2023, when I tried to go on the pill again. I kept bleeding for three weeks taking this pill, so I quit the pill- which likely messed up my hormones.

So in autumn 2023, I lost my period, again. I was unfortunately working in a stressful job again, and still restricting my calories (not crazy much)‚Ä¶ but I believe it was largely the pill‚Äôs fault‚Ä¶ it had messed me up previously ü•∫ but as always, it was a combination of factors. In the end of 2024, I quit the stressful job.

For over 1.5 years, I have been without a natural period, knowing it would come back, but not when üôÅ it sucked. I want children in the future.

Yesterday, in July 2025, I finally regained my natural period! ‚ù§Ô∏è

While maintaining a BMI below 20.

I also had ovulatory pain 2 weeks ago, so I pray that it‚Äôs a signal that everything‚Äôs healthy ü•∞üôèüèª

What did I do to regain it?

‚Ä¢ Listen to my hunger cues! Eat when hungry (but not overeat). I likely increased my daily intake by 200-300 calories during the latest 10 weeks 

‚Ä¢ Sleep well, 7-9h/night

‚Ä¢ Healthy eating, a lot of water, coffee in the morning only, minimal alcohol

‚Ä¢ Eat more carbs than before 

‚Ä¢ Not have a stressful ‚Äùalways on call‚Äù job 

‚Ä¢ Trust the process! If you had it before, it will come back

Waltz No.2 crackles softly from an old Crosley radio in the corner. The room is thick with smoke, the air stale and heavy. An ashtray overflowing with spent cigarette butts sits on the coffee table in front of me. I take a slow drag, the ember flaring briefly, and run my bruised, blood-soaked hands through my greasy hair. Turning in my chair, I glance down at her corpse lying just inches behind me, the screwdriver still jutting from her throat. ‚ÄúCheating bitch,‚Äù I mutter, taking another drag from my cigarette. In truth, I had no real proof of her being unfaithful - just her being home late one too many times. That was enough to let the paranoia creep in, curl around my spine, whisper things I didn‚Äôt want to hear. She always got defensive. Told me I was being paranoid, insecure, maybe I was. But that tone in her voice‚Ä¶ that look in her eyes, it was like she knew something I didn‚Äôt. I turn back around in my seat, my eyes drifting up the wall to Jesus - his wrists nailed to the cross, the crown of thorns slipping down his brow. He stares down at me from his place on our kitchen wall, solemn and silent, as if passing judgment I can‚Äôt escape. The smoke coils around him, thick and slow, like incense in a church. I stare up at that wooden face, chipped and dust-covered, and for a second, just a second I swear I see his eyes move. I blink. Nothing. Just the silence. Just the creak of the ceiling fan and the distant hum of the radio, skipping every few seconds like it‚Äôs choking on the melody. I lean back in the chair, the old wood groaning beneath me, and exhale. The cigarette burns down between my fingers, ash spilling onto my pants. I don‚Äôt brush it off. I just sit there. Still. Staring. Her blood is starting to dry, darkening the floorboards like spilled wine. It creeps slowly, soaking into the grooves, and I can‚Äôt help but think how quiet she is now. Peaceful, even. She used to talk too much. Laugh too loud. Always humming some stupid song while she cooked. Now she‚Äôs quiet. Obedient. Still, and yet - Jesus still stares. ‚ÄúI should probably clean her up,‚Äù I mutter to myself, rising with a groan. My body aches from the fight she put up. I slide a fresh cigarette between my lips, letting it hang there as I shrug my suspenders off my shoulders. They drop around my waist with a snap. The floor creaks under my feet as I walk over to her, each step slow, deliberate. Her limbs are twisted at odd angles, eyes still open, mouth half-parted like she died mid-plea. I crouch beside her, flick the lighter. The flame dances in her glassy eyes. I bend down and wrap my fingers around the handle of the screwdriver, gripping it tight. With a slow, deliberate pull, I ease it from her throat - the metal slick with blood, which follows in a sluggish stream. I let the tool clatter to the floor without a second glance. Turning back to her, I slip my arms beneath her lifeless frame and lift. My back protests with a sharp ache as I rise to my feet, her weight heavy, limp, and familiar in a strange, unsettling way. ‚ÄúJust like our wedding day,‚Äù I think, as her head lolls against my shoulder. Her skin is cold now, colder than I expected. Not like when she used to curl up beside me on the couch, not like when she‚Äôd press her fingers to my chest in those half-hearted apologies. No, this cold is final. I carry her through the kitchen, past the clock that hasn‚Äôt worked in months, past the vase she always kept filled with flowers. They‚Äôre wilted now. Dead. Like everything else in this godforsaken house. My foot knocks against a loose floorboard as I reach the basement door. The hinges shriek when I pull it open, the sound sharp and alive in a house gone silent. I descend slowly, one step at a time, the stairs groaning beneath our weight. Down here, it‚Äôs darker. The kind of dark that swallows sound, thought, even guilt - if you sit in it long enough. I lay her down gently on the tarp I spread days ago. Just in case. She settles like a broken doll, limbs bent wrong, dress clinging to her in places it shouldn‚Äôt. I sit beside her, cigarette still burning between my lips, the smoke curls up into the beams above, disappearing into the shadows. Down here, there‚Äôs no ticking clock, no judgmental eyes, no crucifix to watch me. Just her and me. Like it was supposed to be. I reach over and brush a strand of hair from her face. It sticks to her cheek, damp with blood. I tuck it behind her ear anyway, a gesture I used to do when things were good. When she still loved me. ‚ÄúYou made me do this,‚Äù I murmur, voice low, almost tender. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve just told me the truth.‚ÄùThe silence agrees with me. It always does. I get up and walk to the corner of the basement where the tools are kept‚Äîeverything neatly in place. I planned this. Not the killing, maybe‚Ä¶ not exactly. But the rest. The disposal. The preservation. I open the cabinet, pull out the plastic sheeting, the duct tape, the saw. My hands don‚Äôt shake. Behind me, the radio upstairs skips again. That same piano line from Waltz No.2 like it‚Äôs on a loop. Like it‚Äôs mocking me. I smile to myself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I say, more to her than to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure no one comes looking.‚Äù After some time, I make my way back upstairs, wiping the blood from my face with the back of my hand. The air feels heavier now, thicker, like the house itself knows what‚Äôs been done. I stumble slightly, nearly catching my foot on that same warped floorboard in the living room. I glance down, mutter a curse, then lift my eyes again and freeze. He‚Äôs standing there. Jesus. Not the wooden figure nailed above the kitchen wall. No - this is Him, in the flesh. Robes torn and soaked, wrists dripping fresh blood that splashes onto the floorboards in soft, rhythmic taps. His eyes‚Ä¶ hollow. Piercing. Endless. I can‚Äôt move. Can‚Äôt breathe. He says nothing. Just watches me. I take a step back, mouth dry, cigarette dangling from my lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you weren‚Äôt supposed to come down,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúYou stayed on the wall.‚ÄùThe bleeding Christ tilts His head, slow and deliberate. Like He‚Äôs curious. Like He‚Äôs waiting. My heart pounds so loud I can hear it echo in my skull. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real,‚Äù I mutter, eyes twitching. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a‚Ä¶ painting. You‚Äôre wood and nails. You‚Äôre not‚Äî‚ÄùBut He‚Äôs still there. Bleeding. Watching. Silent, and deep down, a voice I don‚Äôt recognize whispers something cold and certain: ‚ÄúYou knew He‚Äôd come‚Äù. I grip the edge of the table, trying to steady myself, but the room is tilting. Breathing feels like drowning. I blink hard. Once. Twice. He‚Äôs still there.  open my mouth to say something - anything - but before I can speak, He moves. Not slowly. Not like a vision or a dream. He lunges forward, wrists still weeping, feet silent on the floor. His face contorted - not in pain, but in fury. Divine, seething fury. I stumble back, slamming into the wall, knocking a picture frame to the ground. Glass shatters. My breath catches. ‚ÄúNO‚Äî‚Äù I shout, raising my hands like they could stop Him. ‚ÄúI did what I had to! She lied! She‚Äîshe made me!‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt answer. Just steps closer. Blood pools at His feet, thick and dark, spreading across the hardwood like it‚Äôs alive. The stench hits me - iron and rot, old church incense twisted into something foul. I close my eyes. Tight. When I open them - He‚Äôs gone. Just the empty room. The broken frame. But the blood‚Ä¶ the blood is still on the floor, and  it‚Äôs not hers I stare at it - those thick, dark streaks - slowly crawling toward my shoes like it‚Äôs got a mind of its own. My hands tremble now, I drop the cigarette. It lands in the blood with a quiet hiss. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt real,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù But the blood doesn‚Äôt care what I believe. It seeps between the floorboards like it‚Äôs feeding the house, like it‚Äôs always been here, just waiting for a reason to rise again. turn and stagger into the kitchen, breathing hard, eyes darting. I need water. I need light. I need something normal. But when I flip the switch - nothing. The bulb overhead just swings gently, lifeless, like someone was here just moments before. My head‚Äôs pounding. My mouth is dry. I grab a glass from the counter, fumbling with the faucet- nothing comes out. Just a dry creak, like the pipes are choking on something. Then I hear it. A creaking floorboard. Back in the living room. No footsteps. Just one, long, deliberate creak. I freeze, the creak echoes in my skull like a gunshot. I don‚Äôt breathe. Don‚Äôt blink. Just stand there, hand frozen on the faucet, heart thudding so hard it feels like it might tear through my ribs. Then another creek, closer this time. I grab the kitchen knife from the block - clutch it tight, white-knuckled. I press my back to the counter, eyes fixed on the doorway. The silence stretches, taut as a wire. Then I see it, a shadow, long and thin, sliding across the wall like it‚Äôs being cast from nowhere. Just a shifting stain moving with intent. I grip the knife tighter. ‚ÄúI said you‚Äôre not real,‚Äù I growl, voice shaking. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just in my head.‚Äù The shadow pauses - then begins to grow. Stretching up the wall, reaching toward the ceiling like arms unfurling. I scream and hurl the knife, it clangs off the wall, useless. The shadow doesn‚Äôt flinch, then footsteps, this time unmistakable. Heavy, bare, wet, I blot through the hallway, up the stairs slamming doors behind me like that‚Äôll stop whatever‚Äôs following. I make it to the bedroom locking the door and pushing a dresser in front of it. I sit on the floor, knees to my chest, heart battering in my ribs like a trapped animal. My hands slick with blood, and now the walls‚Ä¶.they‚Äôre breathing, in and out, in and out, like lungs, like the house itself is alive and choking on my sins. I shut my eyes tight rocking slightly in place. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real.‚Äù I mutter to myself, but deep down I know it is. The room is pitch black now, save for the faint orange glow of the streetlamp bleeding through the curtains. My ears ring with the silence so loud it feels like screaming. I grip my knees tighter to my chest, pressing my forehead to them. ‚ÄúBreathe in and out.‚ÄùI whisper, then there is a scratch, a slow deliberate scraping, wood against wood. It‚Äôs coming from the other side of the bedroom door. I lift my head, barely breathing, my eyes wide in the dark. More scratching, not wild or frantic but calm, and patient like it knows I‚Äôm not going anywhere, a whisper leaks through the door. Just one word. ‚ÄúLiar.‚Äù My mouth goes dry, I can‚Äôt move. Then a loud THUMP, something heavy slams against the door. The dresser shudders. The whole frame groans under the weight. ‚ÄúGo away!‚Äù I shout, voice cracking. Silence, then laughter soft at first but slowly begins to pick up louder, psychotic, not hers, not his, but mine. It‚Äôs me, laughing from the hallway right beyond the door, deep a guttural laughing. I clap my hands over my ears, shaking my head. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äî‚Äù But the voice doesn‚Äôt stop. It rises, echoing like a chorus of me‚Äôs - mocking, jeering, choking on the sound of my own guilt. Then as quickly as it started it stops, everything goes quiet, for a long time there‚Äôs nothing. I lower my hands and begin to crawl slowly to the dresser, heart pounding in my throat, I press my ear to the wood. Silence, maybe it‚Äôs over, maybe‚Äî A whisper from the other end of the door cuts off my train of thought. ‚ÄúYou left the basement door open.‚Äù My blood turns to ice, the basement door. I didn‚Äôt lock it, I didn‚Äôt even close it. I stumble back from the dresser, my breath ragged. My mind races - how long has it been open? How long has something been walking freely in my home, dragging itself up those creaking steps? I glance around the room like the walls might offer answers, nothing but shadows twisting and stretching. ‚ÄúYou left the basement door open.‚Äù The words echo again - this time from the corner of the room. But I didn‚Äôt hear it with my ears I felt it with my skull. My eyes snap to the corners of the room, a figure small, frail, barely visible in the dark crouched like an animal, head tilted just enough to catch the light. Her blue eyes now grey, wide open, lifeless, my heart seizes my mouth opens but nothing comes out. She stand slowly, her limbs creaking like old wood, head cocked to the side, blood still wet down her neck. She takes a step forward, I backpedal hitting the wall behind me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real,‚Äù I whisper, trembling. ‚ÄúI buried you. I cut you up. You‚Äôre not‚Äî‚Äù She smiles, just enough to show her broken teeth. ‚ÄúYou missed a piece Killian.‚Äù The lights explode above me, glass rains down like ash and everything goes black.

Please do yourself a favor (and support this great spot) and check out One Sip in Te Atatu South, great little spot! I took three people there last weekend - $80 for three coffees and three meals! Great food, good serving sizes, good coffee, lovely staff! Seriously, go support them if you haven't before. Most people who live west would have most likely driven past it before and not thought much of it! But seriously, it's great. Wish I took some pics to add here, but there's heaps on Google.

1. The coffee tasted astringent (sometimes feels like unpleasant, sharp, bitter taste)
2. The grinder does not grind fine enough.
3. Tried grinding finer, but the results were inconsistent.
4. Signs of channeling inspite of using WDT.

if the answer is positive you might want to try one of the stepdown baskets (I personally went with Graph - the first link; I have not tried SWorks as it seems more expensive).

For me, the difference was pretty remarkable:  I found myself grinding significantly more coarse for Graph basket than for 18g VST, which was my daily driver until now. This lead to  consistent, smooth shots. I still get well extracted, sweets shots, but with less astringency. 100% consistent. 0% channeling.

This does not cancel HE baskets, there is place for them. But in my experience, HE baskets are less forgiving and more demanding for higher end grinder.

Overall, I am much happier with Graph basket than before. If you were ever curious what would Flair Pro 3 be like if it had electric preheating, look no further... Graph basket even has the same diameter.",1,1752783292.0,FlairEspresso,5,0.67,False
