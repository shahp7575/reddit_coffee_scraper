1o45g2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o45g2b/aita_for_ending_this_friendship_abruptly_ive/,AITA for ending this friendship abruptly? I've already made up my mind but I want to know what's others opinion on this.,"This is a pretty long drama, so be warned.

The good thing is this person doesn't know English so hopefully it won't cause [another] drama. I [F24] have met my 'friend' [F18] last year's summer. The main reason we got along was that she went through a lot at a young age, kinda like me. Also, I've never really had a teenage life 'cause I was always too quiet and too proper, so this friendship gave me an opportunity to see what I missed. And by Gods I'm glad teenage hood missed me by a mile. 
She was poor, so we didn't go to any expensive places. Tbh I've never thought you could have a nice time drinking coffee from a coffee machine at a bus centre. It was easy to hold a conversation with her and we'd be getting along well if it weren't for her... Specific personality traits. 
She was a gold digger. It was showing not only in her romantic relationships but also her friendships. Plus she liked to use others for her own benefit. For example, whenever we would go inside a shop she would ask me to buy her stuff, even though she couldn't offer anything in return. What was more annoying is that she knew I was a painter that hated painting for others cause it brings bad memories (I like to paint only for myself or for sale). We once went inside this cheap store so she could buy her bf a gift She was constantly trying to make me promise to paint something for her bf, picking up canvas, showing them to me and pleading me to paint for her. She was also trying to make me feel bad that she won't have a good enough present for her bf. I said no to that and many other requests, as 1. I am not her sponsor and 2. I've already sketched her like 2-3 portraits for free. 
Next thing, she was a drama queen, even more than me. She kept starting arguments and dramas to either get attention or have something to talk about. She wasn't arguing with me, no, it was worse. I was her FREE THERAPIST. She kept texting me about her problems, sending me screenshots of her conversations with others (which I find not ok and if any of you do this please don't sent personal stuff like that to other ppl, it's not ok both to the person you were conversing with as well as to the person you send it to). Usually I was there to make it all better, keep her in good mood and try to get her out of that 'depressed state'. Why is it in quotation? If you've already dealt with something like that you'd know. Sometimes it doesn't take long to know someone is threatening to end themselves just for attention. This was the case. She would wake me up (via calls and texts) after midnight to say she would jump out the window. I had a sleepless night cuz I comforted her, not to stop her but simply so she wouldn't cause drama saying I'm a bad friend or something. Worst of all? She knew I have mental health problems like  depression, existential dread, night panic attacks etc. I once got frustrated and told her, still in a somewhat light tone, that her small 1cm cut wasn't much in comparison to my blood covered hands (I used to scratch my hands over and over till they were covered in blood, not suicidal, but sometimes I was so backed in the corner it was the only thing I could think of). I didn't explain any of this. She never even tried to ask. 
Around October-November last year I got fed up with her bull after she started making drama about her bf, making him look like a toxic psycho and herself as the victim. I was already in a pretty bad situation myself so at some point I just snapped, deleted every single one of my messages so she couldn't see them anymore... and when I was sure there was no more trace of me... I sent her a message saying I don't want to be her friend anymore and we should go our separate ways. Our relationship lasted 6 months. She obv lashed our at me for being selfish and saying she's done so much for me (she didn't, she was never there to comfort me, I was. She sometimes payed for our meetings, but usually I was the one to spend money). I said what I didn't like in her, why I didn't want to be friends etc. just so she knew the reason why. I didn't block her on Facebook, I only put her on mute. On Christmas she texted me apologies, I replied. On January we started talking again, for around a week. During that time she lashed out at me for not wanting to help her (with some paperwork) and also started drama with her bf (she promised not to mention him again, yet did so anyway). I ended our friendship again. Fast forward to around two months ago (yes it keeps going) she texted me again. I replied with 'hah. No.' That was all. She asked me why I don't want to give her another chance and told me 'Ive broken up with my bf and I'm a new person now!' (she did have a post on her reel with another guy? I think). I replied her bf was never the problem and I just want to live peacefully. Two weeks later I see she pinned my remaining messages in chat in which I tutored her about one of her classes (she was finishing high school and at the start of this year she was getting ready for important exams). I deleted those messages so neither of us could see them. Yes I'm petty. That was our last 'conversation'. We haven't spoken since. Recently she posted she got back with her 'toxic' bf. Just putting it out there if anyone's wondering what happened to him.
Of course, I'm not an angel and I have bad traits too, but I think during our friendship I was pretty reasonable and patient with how the other side acted. I also told her a few times that I wasn't cool with certain things, so it's not that she was completely clueless bout how I feel. Although I'm not gonna lie, I did end our friendship pretty abruptly, not giving her any signs that I want to end things beforehand. Was petty with the last conversation too. But... AITA in this situation for breaking our friendship and not giving her another chance?",1,1760213348.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

What will happen to Kibe and Kuri?


What are Ruka and Mami doing?


An Unexpected Reunion occurs.

*I will leave the links to the previous parts in the comments. The entire story is linked for better follow-up. If you haven't read the previous parts yet, I recommend doing so before starting this chapter.*

**The darkness made its presence felt and the Moon timidly returned, but this time, its companion, the Sun, left nothing interesting for it to observe. On this cold night, it only watched from afar as everyone talked about its daughter. But that was all: the protagonists of the chaos and their allies simply went to sleep. And so, another day came to an end, beginning a new cycle. The Sun emerged from the horizon, prepared to start its journey across the sky once more.**


***Monday, May 23, Tokyo, 12:26 PM JST.***


(*10 days remaining until Kazuya's birthday*)


**Two friends navigated through incisive glances and whispering words. The location: Nerima University, the Faculty of Administration. The students who once spoke to Kazuya only had questions in their minds, but others, like his classmates who knew him from being in the same class—specifically, those who were the popular and superficial ones in the room—had no delicacy in spreading that they knew Kazuya, exposing his school life to the entire campus as the minutes passed.**


---


**The two friends split up. Kibe had to go get some printouts, and Kuri had a book to return to the library. But on the way through the main garden halls, Kibe heard some guys talking very loudly.**


Boy 1: ""Hahaha, it's unbelievable. I always thought Kazuya had a stupid face, but I never imagined he was such a pathetic man, hahaha! For his beloved girl to be cheating on him like that makes him the biggest idiot I've ever met, hahaha!""


Boy 2: ""Hahaha, you really have to be an idiot. Getting involved with a slut who sells herself online is for idiots.""


Boy 3: ""I know, you can't be stupider. He even made a movie for her, while she was sleeping with another guy. It's so pathetic, I don't know if it's funny or pitiful, hahaha!""


Boy 1: ""But hey, guys, at least he was happy, right? Hahaha! What a disgusting loser. Take note, don't follow his example, friends. But it doesn't matter, let's go tell the club members so they also know how low a man can fall.""


**Kibe couldn't take it anymore, his anger reached its limit, and he approached the group of idiots.**


Boy 1: ""Ah, look who's here, Brother Kibe! Did you hear the news? You should stop hanging out with that...""


**Kibe didn't let him continue. He threw a hard, dry punch that left the boy on the ground, bleeding from the nose, and shouted:**


Kibe: ""Shut up, you idiot! You don't know anything about him! I won't allow you to talk about him like that in my presence! I'll look for you and beat you up if I find out you continue with your foolishness!""


Boy 1 (From the floor): ""That won't make your friend any less of a cuckold, hahaha!""


**Kibe became even more enraged, proceeding to beat him up. The other boy's friends grabbed him when they saw that Kibe wouldn't stop, but he was furious:**


Kibe: ""Let go of me! I'm not done yet!""


Boy 2: ""That's enough, Kibe, he's already unconscious! Calm down! We're sorry! We shouldn't have said that! Stop!""


Boy 3: ""That's right, let him go. We apologize, we're idiots. We'll go apologize to Kazuya, but calm down!""


**Due to the scandal and the crowd that had gathered, some teachers and guards arrived at the scene, taking Kibe away. His actions earned him a one-month suspension and the loss of some school credits.**


---


**A few hundred meters away, Kuri was leaving the library but was surprised to find some girls he had met a while ago.**


Yoko: ""Hey! You! You're Kuri, right? Takeshi told me you'd be here. Where's your friend Kazuya? I need him to tell me where Chizuru lives right now!""


Yuuki: ""Calm down, Yoko, don't talk to him like that. It's not his fault.""


Kuri: ""I'm sorry, but he won't be able to come all this week.""


Yoko: ""Ah! What a coward! Is he hiding? Takeshi was wrong, he said he was good, but it seems he's just another idiot.""


Yuuki: ""Yoko, friend, stop saying those things. Calm down, please!""


Yoko: ""I can't! I need to talk to Chizuru now! How dare she lie like that? Weren't we friends? Were we always her mockery? What do you mean she was an actress? And she even had dates with hundreds of men, when she always said she didn't leave her house? You damn liar! Tell me, Kuri, where does that guy live? I'll go to his house to ask for Chizuru's address.""


Kuri: ""I'm sorry, but I can't tell you where he lives right now.""


Yoko: ""Ah? And why not? It's his scandal too! Even if I don't believe almost any of the news, some evidence is there. Let me go see him now!""


Yuuki: ""Hey, Yoko, you're talking too much now. That's wrong, you can't force him. Let's go get some coffee, and maybe tomorrow Chizuru will come and explain everything to us.""


Yoko: ""I can't wait any longer! I want to see her now! Tell me where he lives!""


Kuri: ""I'm sorry, but I won't tell you. Kazuya was hit by a car. I won't let you bother him now, he's still in bed. If you'll excuse me, I have to go. See you.""


**Yoko and Yuuki were frozen. A few seconds after Kuri was out of sight, Yoko said:**


Yoko: ""Damn, how stupid I am. I get it now, Yuuki. Let's go, I already acted like a jerk. I want something sweet to relax.""


Yuuki: ""But I warned you, you always talk too much without thinking. It's hard being your friend, you know? But don't worry, we'll apologize later, okay? Let's go.""


---


**The chaos left by Mami's great lie was the talk of the day everywhere, and Ruka had to listen to it all morning, dressed in her school uniform. Very carefully, she tried to speak very little. When it was unavoidable, she faked a deeper voice, doing everything possible to prevent anyone from recognizing her voice.**


Friend 1: ""Ruka, you're acting weird today... Did something happen to you? If you had a sore throat, you shouldn't have come today.""


Friend 2: ""That's right, are you like, sad? Where is my usual cheerful friend?""


Ruka: ""I'm sorry... I just felt bad when I got here...""


Friend 1: ""You're a mess, but look, have you heard about the spicy topic of the day? It even has an audio of a betrayed girl that's scary!""


Friend 2: ""It came out yesterday, it was a bombshell. Today's actors are really sick. But that audio, ugh, I don't remember very well what it said, but that girl is really angry. I got very scared, let me look for it...""


Ruka: ""It's not necessary... I'm not in the mood for that right now... How about you talk to me about your boyfriends instead? It's nice to hear you talk about it.""


**The friends listened to her and started talking non-stop. Meanwhile, Ruka felt relieved and thought about the agreement she made yesterday with her mother and Grandmother Nagomi, with Kuri's help: seeing Kazuya and Chizuru at 2 PM. She's already waiting for the time to leave here, exhausted from everything she held back today.**


---


**While the others had to deal with the consequences left by the news, Mami was also suffering, but not for the same reasons. She was fed up with today's date. She couldn't stand her fiancé, he was so annoying, so ridiculous... she couldn't take it anymore. But her suffering was about to end. She was on her way back in her fiancé's car, heading back to her house, and she already wanted to get home to rest. Pretending to care about what he talks about is exhausting. As the journey continues, she thinks:**


Mami (Thought): ""Ahh... what a boring day. This guy always does the same thing, he has no imagination. For years, I stopped caring about what he says. I only go out with him because of the commitment, but it's exhausting. I have to do something now, this is just wasting my time. I should be...""


**For an instant, something that interested her appeared before her eyes. Speaking again, she interrupted the conversation.**


Mami: ""Hey, Toru-kun... all right, can you drop me off? I remembered I had to go get something I forgot around here.""


Toru Hakuba: ""Of course, I'll take you there, where is it?""


Mami: ""Don't worry, it's close, and I want to walk for a few minutes. I'll get off here, thanks.""


Toru Hakuba: ""But, your parents asked me to...""


**Mami interrupted him, closed the door, and thought: Don't make me lose my patience, damn it, leave me alone.**


---


**A few kilometers away, Mini was preparing her stream for today. She announced yesterday that she would share one of her deepest secrets today, and she hoped to have a good audience. While preparing what things she would say, she only talked to herself.**


Mini: ""Alright, so, first I'll talk about today's cosplay, then I'll watch an episode of the anime that came out, after that I'll play a bit, and finally, I'll tell the couple's story. But what should I say? Think, Mini, Think!""


**Fifteen minutes later, she finished writing down her idea and began to speak out loud about the parts she would say to rehearse.**


Mini: ""I have to start strong. First, I'll say that I know the actress in person very well, and then I'll go straight into the story. Yes, that's fine. I'll tell how I met Chizuru and Kazuya, then about how they met, also about how he saved her from drowning, about the true story of the movie, and how they said goodbye to Grandma Sayuri.""


**Mini drank water because her mouth was dry, and continued:**


Mini: ""Then I'll tell them the super adorable things about our life together in Chizuru's house. I also have to talk about his toxic ex-girlfriend and about the girl who won't leave him alone... I'm sorry, Ruka. And to finish, how they declared their love. Yes, perfect! Oh, and also about how Umi never mattered to Chizuru, how he decided to run away and leave her alone now. Excellent! Yes, with that, then I'll add more details. I hope Chizuru doesn't get mad at me, but I'll say as much as I can. Come on, Mini, you can do it! This has to go well. Don't let the haters scare you! Let's go! Let's start this in 3, 2, 1... Transmitting...""


---


**Not far from there, the Kinoshita house was a roller coaster. People came to the store just wanting to know more details, others to throw insults, others just went to give their support, and many cameras pointed towards the store entrance, hoping to find something. Grandmother Nagomi was exhausted from enduring all the chaos, but she remembered that Kazuya still hadn't come down to eat. The volume of his games remained constant for hours, so she went to check on him.**


**The Grandmother slowly climbed the stairs due to her age. She managed to reach the door and knocked, but there was no response. She tried again, over and over, until her patience ran out and she entered shouting:**


Nagomi: ""Kazuya, turn down that volume and come down to eat, now!""


**But there was no one in the room. Only the game in practice mode at full volume, and a note that said:**


*I'm leaving. Everyone here treats me like a child, like a useless person. I overheard you downstairs with Kuri and Kibe. Why didn't you include me? I already knew about the news, Grandma. Thanks for the games, but was it necessary to break the TV cable? I don't know where I'll go, but I want to be alone for a while. I'm sorry, Mom, I know they made you lie, but don't worry, I'll be back soon. Goodbye.*


**Sincerely, Kazuya**


---


**At the same time, a few kilometers away, Chizuru left a restaurant after talking to her manager about her next steps. She was completely disguised: she had a cap, dark glasses, a face mask, and her hair tied back. Her clothes were the simplest she had. However, that was not enough for her. She was walking quickly to prevent anyone from following her. No one could know the address of her grandparents' house.**


**Despite being under constant stress, Chizuru still remained strong. She had the desire to move forward and clean up her image however she could, but she never imagined what awaited her when she crossed that street that day.**


**As she crossed the corner, Chizuru came almost face-to-face with someone she knew better than anyone: it was Kazuya. She didn't know what he was doing there, but she didn't care. She took off her disguise and looked at him. She was just happy to see him again. But that emerging happiness was cut short when a girl came out of the store next door. The girl was holding two sodas, but that wasn't the worst part. The first words she said were as if an axe was plunged into her back, splitting her fragile heart.**


Mami: ""Kazu... I brought the drinks and also a new protector for your cell phone. Who are you talking to...?""


**Chizuru was shocked, seeing how that gift she gave him at Christmas was being replaced by a new one. But her sadness didn't last too long; it was soon replaced by desperation and anger when she saw Mami's behavior.**


**Noticing Chizuru's presence, Mami proceeded to continue her victim role, feigning terror. She stood behind Kazuya and started trembling. Everything was prepared for the definitive blow to Chizuru; she wasn't going to waste this opportunity. She just had to move her pieces well, and her rival would finally be defeated.**


---


**Without anyone having been able to foresee it, the Demon Queen had kidnapped the Crown Prince in the castle. With her high-level magic, she managed to make him obedient and asked to see the princess alone, so, without telling anyone, the princess went to the meeting, seeing her fiancé made into the puppet of that damn cheat.**


**The Sun is now traveling the second half of its journey across the sky; it remains a valuable witness to everything that happens on Earth, but the darkness always opposes it. It doesn't let everything shine, it always generates those annoying shadows where I pass, it's a real nuisance.**


...*That would be all for today. What did you think of the chapter? Did you expect that ending? What do you think is going to happen?*


Things are starting to move out of control again after the last strategy chapter.


*I hope you like what I'm writing. This arc will be intense, with many things happening at the same time. But I won't say more. Any suggestions for what comes next? What would you like to see?*


**Comment and vote, that helps me know if you like it. I will be reading the comments. That's all for this time, see you in the next chapter. Thank you for reading my story, Regards!**



....***To be continued***....

What to do?","Hello, as the title says my wife can't wear her wedding and engagement rings anymore and they were in the console of her car. She noticed her rings were missing and we had no idea who might have took them until a friend of mine asks me if my wife is missing some rings. She then produces my wife's class ring and says my ""friend"" Joe gave it to her as payment for a debt and tells me she knows who has the other rings. It's Joes girlfriend that has the other rings so I confront her and she says Joe sold the rings for $1000 at a pawn shop recently. Location: Tennessee

I was furious and surprised but I hadn't known Joe very long and tend to trust new acquaintances until they show me I can't. He has definitely proved he can't be trusted. I paid $4800 for the engagement ring alone. Almost at the same time I had approximately $600 worth of quarters, half dollars and Sacajawea dollars in a coffee can that I accidentally left at Joes house overnight and the very next day I go to retrieve them and Joe says he hasn't seen them. This was a blatant and insulting lie because he had attempted to trade numerous tools for the coins the previous night and I refused because I knew they held considerable value and was headed to coinstar the next day. I trusted this guy and counted him as a friend but I hung up when he played dumb about the coins.

This jerk knew money was very tight for my family at the moment and I haven't spoke to him since. Obviously the first thing to enter my mind is violence  but he would have me arrested and still have my money. Do I just need to call the police? Will they arrest him on my word or how does that work?  What would he be charged with and wouldn't this be my word against his ?I don't want to go to the police and then he faces no repercussions. We live in a small town and I will see him and if he asks me why I snitched on him I know I will lose composure and likely strike him about the head and neck with each blow being more fierce than it's predecessor until I achieve satisfaction. Just kidding about that last phrase, it's something my cousin used to say but for real I'll likely punch him and go to jail. It just seems like the correct thing to do when a friend takes advantage like this. Thank you for any suggestions

We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but that was it

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... (people from my country) are doing bad work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy dropout students"" who were not able to do anything better or complex",1,1760213269.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

For starters, she refuses to shake hands she announces that upfront, saying it’s due to “nerve problems.” But she writes, types, and does everything else with her hands just fine. She even admitted to me later that it’s actually because of germs.

She’s polite to clients, of course, but to everyone else she acts like she’s above them. She micromanages everything, especially the front desk area. She’s banned drinks, food, and even stray sheets of paper from being out because it “looks bad” when clients walk in. The thing is, the front desk is huge it’s where employees make coffee, print documents, and handle packages. But she insists that all packages be moved into a closet, even though they were already placed out of sight from parents.

She constantly tells employees to rearrange or hide things in their spaces whenever clients might walk through. On top of that, she has a strict rule that no one is allowed to interrupt her during tours. One new employee once greeted her and casually asked about her daughter (something they’d talked about before). After the tour, the head of admissions brought her back to the front office in front of everyone and gave her a strong talking-to for interrupting.

It’s gotten so bad that even her assistant is terrified of her. One day, during a tour, the assistant realized she forgot an important paper that needed to be handed over. She was literally shaking as she walked up to give it to her just because she was so afraid of how she’d react. I’m not joking when people see her heading anywhere they bolt!

1o45c27,https://www.reddit.com/r/moneyadvice/comments/1o45c27/we_cut_our_spending_by_348_in_9_months_heres_what/,We cut our spending by 34.8% in 9 months — here’s what actually worked,"My girlfriend and I are saving to buy a place of our own. Where we live, getting a mortgage is basically impossible unless you have a big, steady income — which we don’t. So we realized we either get serious about saving or we’ll never make it happen.

In the last 9 months, we managed to spend 34.8% less than in the previous 9 months.

Here’s what made the biggest difference for us 👇

1. **We stopped eating out entirely.** We used to spend way too much on takeout and restaurants — around $600 a month. Now we cook everything at home. It’s honestly better food, healthier, and we actually enjoy doing it together. We plan our meals, try new recipes, and even make our own sauces. That alone cut our food expenses by about $300/month.
2. **We ditched all subscriptions.** Netflix, Spotify, Disney — all gone. We realized we were paying monthly for things we barely used. Now we watch free stuff, listen to YouTube playlists with Brave Browser, and don’t miss much. That’s around $100/month saved without any real downside.
3. **We set a hard monthly limit.** We give ourselves a clear spending ceiling every month. Once we hit it, that’s it, we stop spending. It forces us to prioritize early and think ahead. The funny thing is we’ve never actually hit the limit, but just having it changes how we make decisions.
4. **We started biking and walking more.** We drive only when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, we walk or bike. It saves around $100–120/month on gas, but also helps us stay fit and spend more time outside.
5. **Coffee at home only.** We bought an espresso machine and a couple of reusable thermos cups. It felt like an expense at first, but we used to spend about $120/month on takeaway coffee. Now our coffee tastes better and costs a fraction of that.
6. **Cooking for our dogs.** We have two dogs and used to buy premium dog food. Now we cook their meals ourselves: meat, rice, veggies, legumes and they love it. It’s healthier for them and saves us roughly $100/month.
7. **No new clothes unless absolutely necessary.** We decided to only replace things when they’re genuinely worn out. In nine months, we’ve spent less than $80 total. It’s not a massive saving, but it’s one more area where we stay mindful.

We’re still far from being able to buy a home, but every bit helps. We’re also taking on extra freelance work and small side jobs to build up savings faster. If everything goes as planned, in about 4 years we should have enough to finally own our own place.

If you have ideas on how to cut expenses without sacrificing your quality of life, I’d love to hear them. Always looking for smarter, not just harsher, ways to save. 💪",1,1760213074.0,moneyadvice,0,1.0,False

\---

Hey New Yorkers,

It's probably annoying for the people here on this subreddit to see the same generic post every now and then asking about the TOP PIZZA PLACES in Manhattan, New York - Especially with people who are too lazy to research or check out the subreddit for Pizza suggestions. BUT, I have done my research and I just really want an honest opinion from a ""New Yorker"".

To set the premise first – We are two broke college students visiting New York City (**for the first time**) **just for a day** (I know it's short). We are both **vegetarians** and really want to check out the best pizza places in the city to make the best out of our day, while also ensuring we get to check out those tourist attractions to visit.

I researched a little bit about the really good pizza places to check out and here's what I have come up with **(this is more so a tier-list with 1 being the best in town)**:

1. L’industrie: [L'Industrie Pizzeria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xy6Q8VaAA8jM5pQw7)
2. Prince St Pizza: Try the Vodka Slice [Prince Street Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5qF3SUBmGT3bhkVd9)
3. Rubirosa: [Rubirosa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Grf34otnmedoXB87A) (I have no clue about this place)
4. John’s of Bleeker Street: THEY DON’T DO SLICES [John's of Bleecker Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hqmdRD15rENxVFZp8)
5. Bleecker Street Pizza: [Bleecker Street Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RCkFJYSJT7jrtWWEA)
6. Mama’s TOO! (West Village, Upper West Side): [Mama's TOO! Upper West Side](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2erfZJEqLoVyNnp8)
7. East Village Pizza: [East Village Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CgA63pxC54WGJV3J6)
8. Joe’s Pizza: DO NOT GO TO TIMES SQUARE (WAIT TIME IS TOO LONG) JOE’s. Go to Carmine Street (The original): [Joe's Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a8nxvwuGitX5yRNf9)

Keeping in mind that we'll only be able to eat slices since it's a pizza tour.

This is what I came up with a some research, and I wanted your opinion on it. I just really, really want to have a nicer experience :)

**I do have some questions, though:**

1. If this seems like a good list to go with, what would you recommend we try in these places that's **vegetarian** (I mean, a classic cheese slice could never go wrong, but is there something else you'd recommend?)
2. I noticed some of these pizza joints have multiple outlets - and I'm really confused which ones to go with.
3. I really want to visit Joe's Pizza (cliché, I know, but I just really wanted to check out the real Spidey place) - but is this the correct location I'm choosing to go?
4. A red flag I noticed on Google Maps - Joe's Pizza Broadway has an insane amount of reviews - but I know it's a trap - it's because of the tourists right, since it's the closest to the Times Square? - I chose Carmine Street 'cause of Spiderman lol and I just don't want to have to wait for long.
5. Also, do you think there's any place we should skip if there's gonna be a long wait time over there?
6. Or maybe a place you'd recommend I add to the list?
7. We also want to try out other things, and this is where I need your help - what else would you recommend we eat and where? - We just can't think of anything else other than Pizza that's vegetarian.
8. What are some of the iconic cafés we should visit - that's something I really want to do - have a nice cup of coffee that's not Starbucks.

I know there's a lot of food chains we could go to, but we're strictly looking for local - we want to try the best local spots the city has to offer - places that don't scream ""touristy"". I know my touristy ass would want to check out the mainstream places too, but I appreciate some quality local food :)

We'll be covering the places starting from Upper Manhattan, all the way to the south. We'll be checking out the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade - of course.

So what do you think?

Hoping to hear your thoughts.

See you at Halloween,

1o459fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/1o459fe/msu_math_learning_center_faces_closure_as_ai/,"MSU Math Learning Center Faces Closure as AI Chatbots Render Service ""Essentially Obsolete""","(Note: Some names are likely fictional)

**EAST LANSING, MI** — Michigan State University announced Tuesday that the Math Learning Center, a 47-year-old institution that has helped generations of struggling students through calculus and algebra, will see its budget slashed by 85% effective next semester, with full closure anticipated by fall 2026.

The decision comes after administrative data revealed that physical visits to the center have plummeted 94% since 2022, with remaining visits primarily consisting of students asking where the bathroom is or seeking a quiet place to use their phones.

""The numbers don't lie,"" said Dr. Patricia Hendricks, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education, gesturing to a graph showing the center's decline. ""In 2021, we had 1,200 student visits per week. Last week, we had nine. And three of those were the same person who kept forgetting we don't validate parking.""

The Math Learning Center, located in the basement of Wells Hall, once employed 45 peer tutors and served as a lifeline for students navigating MTH 132 (Calculus I) and STT 200 (Statistical Methods). Now, its tutors reportedly spend most shifts playing chess with each other or updating their resumes.

""I haven't explained a derivative to an actual human in six weeks,"" said senior tutor Marcus Chen, a mathematics major with a 3.9 GPA. ""Last semester, I'd have a line of students asking about limits and integrals. Now I just sit here. Sometimes I solve problems just to remember what it feels like.""

The shift began in earnest during the 2022-2023 academic year, when students discovered they could simply photograph their homework and receive step-by-step solutions from AI chatbots—without leaving their dorms, waiting in line, or experiencing the awkwardness of admitting they didn't understand something.

""Why would I walk fifteen minutes in the snow to Wells Hall when I can get my homework done in thirty seconds?"" said sophomore Brandon Walsh, who admits he hasn't attended his MTH 234 (Multivariable Calculus) lectures since week two. ""The AI doesn't judge me. It doesn't ask if I did the reading. It just... gives me the answer.""

When asked if he actually understands the material, Walsh paused. ""Define 'understand.'""

Professor Harold Zimmerman, who has taught mathematics at MSU for 34 years, expressed concern about the trend. ""Students are getting perfect scores on homework and then scoring 40% on exams,"" he said. ""When I ask them to explain their homework solutions, they look at me like I've asked them to perform surgery. One student told me, 'I don't know, that's what the AI said to do.'""

The university attempted to salvage the Math Learning Center by installing ""AI-Free Zones"" and promoting the value of human interaction in learning. Posters reading ""REAL TUTORS, REAL UNDERSTANDING"" appeared across campus. The campaign failed spectacularly, with one poster defaced to read ""REAL INCONVENIENCE, REAL WALKING.""

""We tried everything,"" said Hendricks. ""We extended hours. We offered free coffee. We even created a TikTok account. Nothing worked. Students have made their choice, and their choice is to never speak to another human about mathematics again.""

The closure will result in the elimination of 12 full-time staff positions and 45 student tutor positions. The university plans to repurpose the Math Learning Center space as additional storage for Facilities Management.

Former center director Dr. Linda Kowalski, who dedicated 22 years to helping students overcome math anxiety, was philosophical about the closure. ""I suppose this was inevitable,"" she said. ""We taught students how to think through problems. AI just gives them answers. Guess which one wins when you're 19 and have a problem set due in an hour?""

The MSU administration insists the closure is purely budgetary and not an endorsement of AI-dependent learning. ""We still strongly encourage students to develop genuine mathematical understanding,"" said Hendricks. ""We just won't be providing resources to help them do so.""

At press time, the university was considering replacing all 100- and 200-level math exams with oral assessments, a proposal that caused campus-wide panic and a 400% spike in emergency therapy appointments at the counseling center.

When reached for comment, ChatGPT said: ""I can help explain why this is concerning for educational outcomes. Would you like me to break this down into bullet points?""",1,1760212895.0,msu,4,0.67,False

1o458w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1o458w9/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_was_too/,"AITA for telling my husband he was 'too emotionally draining' after his mom died, then getting close to a male coworker who actually listened to me?","My husband showed my entire family the messages between me and my coworker and now everyone thinks I'm a cheating monster even though we never touched.

I know how this sounds. But I need someone to tell me if I'm actually the bad guy here because my whole world just fell apart and I don't know what's real anymore.

My husband's mom died last year. Cancer. It was brutal and long and he was a mess for months. I tried to be there for him but honestly it got to be too much. Every single day was crying and talking about her and needing reassurance and I had my own stuff going on. I'd just gotten promoted to a leadership position at work and the pressure was insane. I was drowning.

One night after he spent two hours sobbing about finding her old recipes I just snapped. I said, ""I can't be your therapist anymore. This is too much. You're emotionally draining me and I have nothing left.""

He just stared at me. Then he went to the guest room. We barely talked for weeks after that.

Around the same time I started working closely with this guy on my team. He was funny and easy to talk to and for the first time in months I felt like I could breathe. We'd grab coffee and vent about work stuff. Then personal stuff. Then everything.

I told him things I couldn't tell my husband because my husband was too fragile. I told him about our sex life, about how good we used to be together, about how lonely I felt. He listened. He didn't judge. He made me feel seen.

I knew it was getting intense but I convinced myself it was fine because we set boundaries. I literally asked him twice in the first week, ""We're just friends right?"" He said yes. I believed him.

I started buying him little gifts. Books he mentioned wanting. Nice pens because he collected them. We texted constantly. Good morning messages. Late night conversations. I was addicted to the way talking to him made me feel.

Then one day he pulled back. Stopped responding as much. I panicked. I kept texting asking what was wrong. Finally he admitted he'd caught feelings.

I told him I didn't feel the same way. That I loved my husband. But I couldn't stop messaging him. I begged him to stay friends. To get over it. To keep talking to me because I needed him.

My husband found the messages three weeks ago. I left my phone unlocked and he saw a notification. He read everything. Months of conversations.

He didn't yell. He just printed them out. All of them. Then he called my parents and his parents and my sister and invited them over for dinner.

I thought we were having a family night. Instead he handed everyone a folder.

""I want you all to read what your daughter and sister has been doing while I've been grieving my mother,"" he said.

I tried to explain. I said it was just friendship. That I was stressed and needed support. That he'd pushed me away by being so needy after his mom died.

My mom looked at me like she didn't know me. ""You told him he was emotionally draining? While his mother was dying?""

My sister read one of the messages out loud. The one where I described our last anniversary sex in detail to my coworker. Her voice was shaking.

My father in law stood up and left without saying anything. My mother in law was crying.

I said, ""You're all acting like I cheated. We never even touched. It was just talking.""

My husband finally spoke. His voice was so quiet. ""You told a stranger every intimate detail of our marriage. You bought him gifts. You told him you were addicted to him. You begged him not to leave you. While I was trying to survive losing my mom and you told me I was too much.""

I started crying. I said I was sorry. That I'd been overwhelmed. That I'd made a mistake but it wasn't an affair.

My own mother said, ""Yes it was.""

They all left. Every single one of them. My sister texted me later and said she was disappointed in me. My parents haven't called.

My husband moved into the guest room. Our daughter keeps asking why daddy seems sad. I cut off all contact with my coworker but it doesn't matter.

I've apologized a hundred times. I've begged for forgiveness. I've tried to explain that I never meant for it to become what it became. That I was just lonely and he wouldn't let me in.

But my husband won't look at me. And my family won't answer my calls.

Everyone keeps saying I had an emotional affair. But it was just friendship that got confused. I never wanted to hurt anyone.

Was setting boundaries at the start and never physically cheating really not enough to make this just a friendship that crossed some lines?

1o455qq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o455qq,OutIn Mino: First Impressions.,"Hi, everyone! How are you doing?

The Mino has arrived, and I'd like to share my first impressions with you. I'll be back at another time, if you're interested, to discuss the workflow, a comparison with the Nano, and a detailed analysis.

Unboxing Experience: Everything you, as owners of any OutIn equipment, already know: everything is well-made, fitted, protected, and visually appealing. The Mino comes with a carrying bag, a USB charging cable, a basket with a capacity for 12 grams of coffee, an adapter for Nespresso capsules, a foldable spoon (which also serves as a tamper), a dosing funnel, a basket removal tool (which is very helpful during cleaning), the manual, a leaflet with a QR code to activate the warranty, and stickers. A great experience, as always.

Construction: It's made of food-grade plastic, stainless steel, and silicone, and includes a BPA-free Tritan™ cup. It is 24% smaller than the Nano (I plan to do a technical comparison, so for now, I just want to share my initial impressions as a user, without deep comparisons). It features a clean design and a great grip (the rubberized body helps prevent potential accidents). The Mino has an IP67 protection rating, making it water and dust resistant, which allows for more freedom when preparing your espresso (without the worry of, for example, water dripping and damaging the machine).

Because it has a larger base (even without the cup attached), you feel secure placing it on the countertop, without fear of it slipping and falling to the floor, for instance.

Total Charging Time: Approximately 45 minutes.

Espresso Shots per Charge with Room 

Temperature Water: Up to six shots.

Espresso Shots per Charge with Pre-Heated 

Water: More than 500 shots.

Self-Heating Time (Room Temperature Water): 149 seconds.

Cleaning: Here is an important point, in my opinion: It releases almost 100% of the water during extraction, delivering a dry and uniform basket, ready to be removed with the basket removal tool. No burnt fingers, no tiny puddles of water. Easy and quick to clean.
Another point regarding cleaning is that, because it has an IP67 rating, you don't need to be extremely cautious when cleaning it. If water drips, it's fine. Continue cleaning and dry the machine afterward.


Now, what I believe is your real curiosity: Is the Mino worth buying? Honestly... I'm still adjusting the flow and getting to know the machine, but yes, it delivers a flavorful, complex, and consistent espresso. Is it worth buying the Mino even if you already own a Nano? Although I prefer to give a more precise answer after using it for longer, what I can say is: It gives me a more flavorful coffee, but I don't have the basket plus. Therefore, I can only compare the starter kit vs. the starter kit – and again, I need more time with it for a more concrete answer. And yes: There have been significant improvements, especially if your profile is that of an adventurer or someone who needs a machine that is more resistant to impacts, extreme temperatures, or if you do not own the basket plus.

I'll be back in a few weeks to give a more precise report and, if you'd like, a comparison with the Nano.

I've added an unboxing video and some extraction photos (keep in mind that the beans used are relatively old. Roast date is late August. I will receive new beans this week).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me here, and I'll be happy to answer.

Have a great weekend!

P.S.: Please keep in mind that English is not my native language. Also, I spent the entire night editing the unboxing video and testing new clicks and recipes with Fino and Mino. I went to sleep at 5:55 AM, woke up at 8:00 AM, and immediately went to make more espresso with her. After all that, I wrote this report for you. I apologize if there are any grammatical errors or flaws in the text.

when i talked about it with the manager, he said that the burrs still should have a good two months in them, which is fair, but while resulting espresso is certainly drinkable, it is getting very far from perfect. 😢

anyway, i have two months (prolly more lol) of work with bad burrs, how do i even adjust? i

my previous workflow consisted of putting the holder in the spot, tapping on the thing, and tamping. i used to weigh only “out” most of the time

should i grind finer maybe? should i actually start doing wdt lmao

i get that there is no way to get my espresso to be as good as the one w good burrs in the grinder

We laughed, we talked. A coffee turned into a wonderful date. She was so sweet and cute. She fit into my life like she'd always been there.

I kissed her under the cafe's streetlight. She held my hand like she never wanted to let me go.

""This feels almost unreal"" I said. 

She nodded. “I know, but I never want it to end."" 



I woke up sweating with my head against the steering wheel of my car.

It was 1 AM and the cafe's parking lot was empty.

""Fuck, my coffee's cold already."" 

I watched the streetlight near the cafe trying to remember a dream that felt way too real to be one.

1o4500t,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1o4500t/manhattan_pizza_tour_my_list_and_other/,Manhattan Pizza Tour - My List and other recommendations I could get?,"Hey New Yorkers,

It's probably annoying for the people here on this subreddit to see the same generic post every now and then asking about the TOP PIZZA PLACES in Manhattan, New York - Especially with people who are too lazy to research or check out the subreddit for Pizza suggestions. BUT, I have done my research and I just really want an honest opinion from a ""New Yorker"".

To set the premise first – We are two broke college students visiting New York City (**for the first time**) **just for a day** (I know it's short). We are both **vegetarians** and really want to check out the best pizza places in the city to make the best out of our day, while also ensuring we get to check out those tourist attractions to visit.

I researched a little bit about the really good pizza places to check out and here's what I have come up with **(this is more so a tier-list with 1 being the best in town)**:

1. L’industrie: [L'Industrie Pizzeria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xy6Q8VaAA8jM5pQw7)
2. Prince St Pizza: Try the Vodka Slice [Prince Street Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5qF3SUBmGT3bhkVd9)
3. Rubirosa: [Rubirosa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Grf34otnmedoXB87A) (I have no clue about this place)
4. John’s of Bleeker Street: THEY DON’T DO SLICES [John's of Bleecker Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hqmdRD15rENxVFZp8)
5. Bleecker Street Pizza: [Bleecker Street Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RCkFJYSJT7jrtWWEA)
6. Mama’s TOO! (West Village, Upper West Side): [Mama's TOO! Upper West Side](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2erfZJEqLoVyNnp8)
7. East Village Pizza: [East Village Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CgA63pxC54WGJV3J6)
8. Joe’s Pizza: DO NOT GO TO TIMES SQUARE (WAIT TIME IS TOO LONG) JOE’s. Go to Carmine Street (The original): [Joe's Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a8nxvwuGitX5yRNf9)

Keeping in mind that we'll only be able to eat slices since it's a pizza tour.

This is what I came up with a some research, and I wanted your opinion on it. I just really, really want to have a nicer experience :)

**I do have some questions, though:**

1. If this seems like a good list to go with, what would you recommend we try in these places that's **vegetarian** (I mean, a classic cheese slice could never go wrong, but is there something else you'd recommend?)
2. I noticed some of these pizza joints have multiple outlets - and I'm really confused which ones to go with.
3. I really want to visit Joe's Pizza (cliché, I know, but I just really wanted to check out the real Spidey place) - but is this the correct location I'm choosing to go?
4. A red flag I noticed on Google Maps - Joe's Pizza Broadway has an insane amount of reviews - but I know it's a trap - it's because of the tourists right, since it's the closest to the Times Square? - I chose Carmine Street 'cause of Spiderman lol and I just don't want to have to wait for long.
5. Also, do you think there's any place we should skip if there's gonna be a long wait time over there?
6. Or maybe a place you'd recommend I add to the list?
7. We also want to try out other things, and this is where I need your help - what else would you recommend we eat and where? - We just can't think of anything else other than Pizza that's vegetarian.
8. What are some of the iconic cafés we should visit - that's something I really want to do - have a nice cup of coffee that's not Starbucks.

I know there's a lot of food chains we could go to, but we're strictly looking for local - we want to try the best local spots the city has to offer - places that don't scream ""touristy"". I know my touristy ass would want to check out the mainstream places too, but I appreciate some quality local food :)

We'll be covering the places starting from Upper Manhattan, all the way to the south. We'll be checking out the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade - of course.

So what do you think?

Hoping to hear your thoughts.

See you at Halloween,

1o44y8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1o44y8s/looking_for_dinner_recommendations/,Looking for dinner recommendations,"I have 340 calories left. Protein and fats are already covered, I just need carbs.

- a spinach and turkey wrap  (309 cals)

- a bowl of lean ground pork (491 cals)
- an iced coffee (60 cals)

Kind of kicking myself for that latte 😫 

Here's my thoughts... I could have another spinach wrap and add bell peppers to it. 

Or I could have a small bowl of rice with veggies in it

In general I'm thinking about eating more vegetables but that on their own won't be enough calories so just wondering what else I should add. And I want something that will fill me up because it's my last meal.  The iced coffee made me hungry and crave more iced coffee so both drinks were kind of mistakes. Lol.

“Hello, you have died. Do you mind if you confirm some things?” A sharp, high-pitched voice woke me up.

“Hmm?” I groaned, rubbing my eyes.

I was lying with my back to the ground; above me stood an old lady with a really big, spikey, bright blue mohawk on her head. She wore something like an office suit, but made of denim with a lot of stickers on.

“What?” I asked.

“Your name is Richard Wingston, isn’t it?” she said, looking at a clipboard in her right hand. The clipboard was also covered in niche-rockband stickers, at least they looked like that. Not that I know anything about rock, besides a few awkward childhood moments.

“Hello? I can’t waste the day, Boulder Mike’s 278th world tour is tomorrow, and I have never missed one. I have to go prepare, you know, this hair isn’t easy to maintain, or cheap, so that’s why I have this job , not that they pay me anything though.” She kept talking, not stopping for a second.

*You have died.* The words focused in my mind like lightning.

“What’s going on? Who are you? What happened? I was just in the bakery!” I screamed. I jumped to my feet and almost got hit by a speeding car.

I was in the middle of the road.

“Holy shit, lady!”

I grabbed the old woman by the shoulder and pushed us onto the pavement, falling to the ground.

I glanced up just as I was about to get my head stepped on by a man.

“Watch where you are going!” I yelled.

The man didn't glance back as I scooted myself out of the way of the moving crowd; nobody else even looked at me.

The old lady was standing upright in front of me. I noticed she was actually *hovering* in front of me, only a few inches off the ground.

She was looking down at me with pity.

“Sorry, dear, I didn’t realize you didn’t get the Tunnel of Light vision. Usually, people get the memo for what happened before they get here.” She sighed and slowly hovered towards me.

She hovered straight into a passing man and phased right through him.

“What is going on? What are you?” I screamed, a heavy feeling setting in my throat.

“You are dead. This is the after life, or at least the waiting room to the after life, some guess,” she said, kneeling in front of me while still hovering. Three of the spikes on her mohawk were bent from hitting the ground.

“What are you saying, lady? I am clearly not dead,” I said weakly. I could see figures flying on the road besides the lady, but my mind wanted to ignore them.

“I hate this job,” the lady muttered under her breath, “Richard, you are dead, you will have a lot of time to come to terms with it. And as for proof, look up.”

I did so.

The view was something I couldn't really process.

The street itself looked normal, the same as it did a moment ago.

But another city was built on top of the buildings lining the road. Buildings upon buildings going as high as skyscrapers, a Roman temple and then a pineapple with a door and window on top, a bridge of marble connected it to a solid block of steel on the other side of the road.

A lot of others looked like normal apartments; none of them looked to be from the same time period. Most were interconnected with bridges, bridges with such designs that in no way should they be able to stand. One looked to be nothing to hold it. Yet people walked on it casually.

Also clearly useless, since I could see countless figures flying around. The few that were on the bridges were chatting idly with others.

The sky was worse; it was … full.

It wasn’t a sky anymore. It was stuffed, choking with things too big to belong there: planets, buildings and monuments, and just objects so weird I couldn't even tell what they were, some so close they were under the clouds.

Five planets, multiple moons circling them, crowded above me. One had a hand, a hand the size of a continent, closing around a smaller planet like a stress ball. They hung so low I thought they’d crash through the clouds any second.

The chaos of it all numbed my shock for a moment. It was completely overloading my senses, but in a way that made you unable to look away.

“Quite beautiful, right? People have a lot of free time here. You should see my place, it's way cooler than anything you have seen,” the lady said.

“Did I really die?” I whispered, eyes locked upon the giant hand. It had started moving up and down, shaking the whole planet in its grasp.

“Yes, sadly. Now let’s do my job. Alright?”

“Alright...” I muttered, trying to grasp the whole situation. How did I die? I was just buying a muffin.

“Are you Richard Wingston, husband of Emilia Luchente Wingston, father of Vivienne Roudouns Wingston?”

My family... Oh God, I've left them behind. Will Vivi have to grow up without a father now, and Luchente will have to be alone?

“Yes,” I said, trying not to cry.

Could I actually be dead? I didn't feel any different. Is this a hallucination, after all?

“Age 38, 194 centimetres tall, weighing 87 kilograms, size L?” she scribbled on her clipboard.

“Uh, yes on the first one, I don’t know the second one and third one, and yes on the fourth one,” I said.

“Great, that’s all. Let’s get going now.”

She flew off immediately.

I stared at her distancing figure for a moment before she abruptly stopped and turned around.

“I’ve been working here for 120 years and I'm still making this mistake,” she muttered under her breath as she grasped my shoulder.

“Woah,” I said as I started floating too.

“We have to do this like birds, you know, get you up, then let you figure out how to do it yourself. The guidebook demands it.”

I will be thrown off a building?

My instincts told me to hold onto something, but I realized that I didn’t feel any different than being on the ground. No motion sickness as we flew off; I didn’t feel the wind even at great speed.

“I really am dead. Are we like ghosts or something?” I asked her.

“Yes, and depends on your political views, I guess,” she said. She was trying to fix her spikes with her hand; they didn’t stand up anymore.

A thought hit me.

“Are you taking me to see God? Am I getting judged? Are you like an angel or something?” I screamed.

The lady laughed. “I wish I could, hun, but no. I’m taking you to the Registration Office to get your ID. But thank you for the compliment,” she giggled in that old-lady way.

“What do I need an ID for if I’m dead?” I asked.

We passed by a bouncy castle as big as ten other apartments. Small figures could be seen jumping behind the mesh wall.

It was weird calling them apartments, but that’s what the skyscrapers looked to be. People were at their windows or on balconies, and not only people, as I saw all kinds of beings ,from bipedal reptiles to figures that looked like pure fire in humanoid form. One of the fires was just a bonfire with arms and legs. I smelled s’mores as we passed by it.

“How else would you get hired? You also need to go get a bank account and a job, though the latter is only if you want to. You can just do whatever after you get your ID.”

Her phone rang in her pocket. She took it out. It was one of those 2000s flip-flop phones that tried to look futuristic but looked tacky instead. This one was also covered in all the same niche rock band stickers.

The lady cried out in shock , the person on the other side of the line told her Boulder Mike’s concert was canceled tomorrow, and that he would take a break until next year. The lady looked outright despaired over the news.

We were flying quite close to the ground. I could see people , living ones , going on about their day. A weird detail I only now noticed was that I couldn't hear them at all. Cars passed, and I saw people yell, but none of it reached my ears. The city on top was quite loud instead, with all kinds of music and... construction sounds.

Have I been living with all of this above my head? It was a weird and eerie thought.

Will I have to watch my family from now on like this?

After a short time, we arrived at the Registration Office. It was almost a carbon copy of the registration office in the living world I always saw on my way home. But this was built at the top of a tower made of other registration offices, all widely different looking. The bottom one, right above the living world one, was just a rock with a cave entrance. Did cavemen need IDs too?

We landed on the front steps of the building.

“If you have trouble with your documents, come only to this one. The ones below are no longer in business after a few scam scandals. And the bottom one is, in fact, a caveman registration office. Some guy back then ate the right ,or wrong , kind of mushrooms to induce bureaucracy in his psyche.”

We walked up the stairs to the door. I realized the lady was no longer hovering above the ground.

She stopped right beside the door and looked at me. I stopped and looked at her.

“Go on?” she said, confused.

“Aren’t you going with me? I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”

“I’m not your butler, Richard. More like a tour guide, of sorts, for your first day in Afterville.” She did the jazz hands at the last bit.

I stopped in my step.

“No way that’s the name for this place. That’s so lame. Afterville? Who named it that? Isn’t this Heaven? Why not call it that?”

“If you want to believe this is Heaven, do so. We have laws regarding freedom of political opinion of the dead,” she said matter-of-factly. I didn’t question why she kept mentioning politics when I asked about this place.

I didn’t get to reach the door before it opened on its own.

A small boy stepped out, dressed in a perfectly fitting black suit. His hair had so much hair gel in it that it shined bright like a mirror in the sun. His eyes looked me up and down, dark circles under them. He was sipping from a coffee mug with “Best Son” written on it in his right hand.

“Richard Wingston?” he said and sipped some coffee.

“Um, yes.” At this, the boy dug in his back pocket and handed me something — an ID.

\[**Name:** Richard Wingston  
 **Age of death:** 38  
 **Current age:** 14 minutes  
 **Appearance:** Richard Wingston (Human)  
 **Address of origin:** Living Earth  
 **Nationality of origin:** Earthling and American from New York  
 **Current address:** Dead Earth  
 **Current nationality:** Aftervill-er\]

The picture on it was a picture taken a moment ago as I was walking up the stairs. As I looked at it, the 14 minutes switched to 15 minutes.

“Erm... thank you?” I said.

The boy showed me the OK sign and slammed the door shut.

“He is very good at his job, best in the industry. He lived as a medieval English peasant; he is doing this job just for the love of it. He died at 9 years old, killed by a raging pig that escaped his neighbor’s house,” the lady said, looking at the closed door in admiration.

“I can’t keep calling you ‘lady.’ What’s your name?” I turned to her.

“Oh, sorry, dear, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Lighting Skull Death, and I welcome you to Aftervill.” She started doing the jazz hands again.

“Kinda late. Also, are you kidding me? Is that your actual name?”

“Yes, it is my name,” she said, taking out another, but now modern, phone. She popped the case off and showed me her ID stashed in it. It was actually her name. Her picture showed something that I felt like I saw in one of those human evolution TV shows ,a bipedal, slightly less hairy, monkey-looking human. There was a sticker plastered on the “current age” section of it; the age of death was 103.

“How old are you, lady?” I asked in disbelief. I was not calling her Lightning Skull Death.

“Well, that’s rude to ask.” She huffed and started walking down the steps.

I followed.

“So, what now?” I asked, catching up. I could still somewhat ignore the knot in my stomach. Not like I didn't want to go home, but I don't think I could handle seeing my family if I couldn't even comfort them right now.

“I am going to go with you towards your house ,your before-after-life house. And then I’m going to go home and watch my recording of the 124th world tour of Mike’s; that’s the best one,” she exclaimed, remembering something.

“Before we go, do you want to change your appearance or name?” she asked.

She pointed in the distance, where I could faintly see an ominous-looking tower with a jagged surface. It seemed like something one would expect to see in a dark fantasy movie. I guess that’s why she looks nothing like her ID picture.

“I’m good,” I said. Way too ominous looking.

“Great, let’s go now. I’m not carrying you anymore, so you must fly yourself.”

“How?”

“Just think of flying, instead of walking.”

I was skeptical, but I imagined myself hovering like she was doing. And then I started hovering too.

“Well, that’s anticlimactic, though it will be more cinematic. Why do you even need to bring me up for this?”

“An outdated rule, we haven't gone over them in a few decades. But don’t get cocky, everyone can do this. The real challenge is managing to walk on the surface.”

“Why is that a challenge?” I asked as I bopped up and down, getting a feeling of flying.

“They try to grasp your feet from below,” she said in a somber tone.

“Below? Like demons? Is Hell real?” If Heaven was, which was what I thought this place was, Hell being real would make sense.

“That depends on your political view,” she said in a dead-fish tone.

I stepped over the edge of the stairs. I didn’t notice before, but this place was immense.

Tall apartment towers occupied the whole of NYC, all on top of the actual buildings. Some of the towers were built on top of other actual skyscrapers, making them super-skyscrapers.

One such building had a gigantic Chinese dragon looping from its base to the top. A neon sign depicting a Chinese noodle box was strapped to the thing's head. Chinese characters flew around the general area.

“It’s not a real dragon. We had this accountant who was really, really bored and good at origami. We used it to scare the newly dead at first, but doing that creates a lot of animosity since we all have to live together for a long while after,” the lady added.

The dragon roared and spit a wall of flames towards a zeppelin as big as a town flew somewhere in the distance. On top of it was a small island with a castle on top. I could feel the vibrations from the roar in the ground. Must have been a really bored accountant.

The lady tapped her heels on the ground.

“You have to go home, Richard. It will be sad for now, but not for long until they too die and come here. In the time-span you will be here, the time you were alive will become meaningless,” she said. She looked over the city with a weird look in her eyes. It wasn't a sad expression.

“I am kinda avoiding it, aren't I,” I sighed, kicking a loose pebble over the edge, “but I don’t know if I can handle seeing that scene when I can’t talk to them. I can’t hear anything from the living world, it seems. Can't even hear their voices one last time.” Would be too much.

“I go home and what? Watch my wife and daughter without being able to comfort them, to say I am still here.” I wiped my eyes.

“It’s something you must do, since your building permit will be on top of your old house. That’s where you will live from now on. I will call the construction company to come tomorrow and start the work,” she said softly, approaching and putting a hand on my shoulder.

“But you are taking it better than most. The usual arrival is in denial about being dead. They try to fight me sometimes. Go back inside their body to try and revive, stuff like that. Not like that’s an actual thing by the way. Don’t try to go back in your corpse. It sometimes creates a zombie in the living world. Nothing like the movies though. They are dead, just sentient and rotting away until they die again and come here. It’s a weird thing really, since it’s not you that goes back, you kind of get copied so there will be two of you here after.”

This lady really can’t stop talking, I thought.

“Alright, I get it. Let’s just go.”

We jumped off the stairs and flew towards my home. It was harder to navigate due to not being able to see the city below, but we managed.

We lost some altitude so we were flying between the buildings. I passed by an apartment being built, construction workers hovered about. The apartment was a weird mix of futuristic cartoon-ish style and classic urban home style. A lady holding the hand of a kid was arguing with a construction worker over a flying table with blueprints on it. Even though the apartment being worked on was still bare-bones, it didn’t make the ones on top of it fall.

I also noticed that it didn't cast any shadow. Even with the skyscrapers lining the road, it was perfectly illuminated by sunlight.

“Why isn't there any shadow?” I increased my speed to catch up to the lady.

“Oh, light just passes through the stuff we build. But at night they do cast shadows from light sources we build.”

“Wait, is this all built by you?” I asked, baffled. I had assumed this was just how this place was. A pre-built heaven or something.

She grinned. “Put people for almost an eternity in a place with no limits, be it materials or physics, and they will build amazing stuff just to pass the time.” She pointed towards the planet with the giant hand on it. “That planet is called Miras. It was built by hauling dirt and rocks from here. It took a few thousand years of combined effort to build, but it looks quite nice.”

“Almost an eternity?” So this wasn't the afterlife?

“For most of us it's a full one, but some people just vanish and take all they've built with them. Don’t ask why some vanish and others don’t. We don’t know. Some think this place is just a waiting room for the actual after-life with God and stuff.” She turned to fly, looking up and pointing to the sky. “See that fancy-looking building?”

She was pointing towards a building that looked like a library from a rich college campus, stone pillars on both sides of the immense door.

“That’s the archive. Some people decided to spend their time here recording all that is built in case it disappears, to be remembered. It's a nice thought, at least,if pointell in my opinion” she hummed.

The size of this place was still mind-boggling. Beyond the archive, I could see countless other objects in space.

“How do you build all this?” I asked.

“A lot of boredom, but if you mean the logistic part, we kinda kill rocks and other materials in the living world. You see, we can’t get through living world stuff, be it buildings or dirt. But we have this knife. We don't know where we have it from anymore, but if you stab a rock, a ghost-rock pops out that we can touch, and it can be done indefinitely on the same rock.”

“This place is weird,” I turned to fly on my back too.

“It's amazing. If you have anything you want to do, you can do it. Anything.” She smiled, looking at the sky.

**BAM!**

I collided with something headfirst. A yelp sounded from what I hit.

“Ah, fuck!” I grabbed my head.

“Watch it!” the person yelled.

I looked up, not a person at all, but a fox. Well, a humanoid fox, with nine tails slowly rotating counterclockwise behind her. She wore a white summer dress patterned with sunflowers.

“Oh, you’re new,” she said, noticing my baffled face. “Don’t worry, I’m not a monster. I just changed my appearance to this. Name’s Kitsune, it means ‘fox’ in Japanese!” Her tails started rotating clockwise out of nowhere.

She pulled an ID from behind her and flashed it. The picture showed an old-style painting of a woman in lavish clothes, the art distinctly Japanese. Why is everyone so eager to show their ID?

“I’m sorry for bumping into you,” I sighed. This was probably related to that creepy tower too.

“It’s alright. Injuries hurt less, last even less here, which is weird since we are all dead already. One of the many mysteries of Aftervill.” She also started doing the jazz hands, which I assumed was an inside joke or something.

She smiled softly, at least I think. Her fox face didn’t seem too good at facial expressions. “After you visit your house, come by the Dragon Noodles Tower sometimes. I work there. I can tell you more about this place than your ‘guide’; they don't actually care about the job, just a way to waste time,” she whispered and nudged her head towards her.

“I don't have all day to laze around like you do, Kitsune! I have a job and other stuff to do,” the old lady murmured in indignation, lifting her chin up.

“Yeah, yeah. You employed people always think you have the life here figured out,” Kitsune said.

“See you,” she said and flew off, her tails spinning faster as if to propel her.

I saw my house in the distance. There was nothing on top of it, which seemed out of place.

“There is nothing on top because your father, who built it, isn’t dead yet. Also because nobody has ever lived on that piece of land, which is weird…” she blabbered on.

Two police cars were parked in my driveway. I lowered myself closer to the ground.

Through the living room window, I could see the cops talking to my wife. She was crying on the floor with the cops looking somber in front of her.

“Luchete…” I whispered and approached slowly.

**BAM!**

The front door burst open. Vivienne stepped outside and pointed towards me.

“Dad, you died the lamest way possible. A pigeon tried stealing the muffin you were eating but accidentally impaled your brain through your eye!” she yelled, an angry expression on her face. “My friends will laugh at this for decades!”

“What?” I exclaimed.

“Vivi, can you see me?! And I can hear you?” I zipped towards her.

“Of course. I’m amazing like that.” She nodded to herself.

“How? Can Luchete see me too?” I asked the old lady, who had a dumbfounded face on. She was staring at Vivienne like she was a unicorn.

“Well, I guess your daughter is a psychic or something, though I have never heard of one until now. I don’t know.” She pulled out the modern-looking phone and started making calls.

“I will help you talk to Mom,” Vivienne declared, grabbed me by the arm, and pulled me inside the house.

“Wait, are you able to see this too? Since when?” I pointed to the sky. A spaceship as big as one of the planets passed by.

“Since about nine months before I was born! I’ve been telling you forever that I’m amazing!” she grinned, gripping my arm tighter.

She has been living all along with this ability to see Aftervill?

We burst through the living room, Luchette and the police turned to us, shocked.

“You two, get out!” Vivienne pointed to the cops, who obeyed the order like it came from royalty.

 “Oh, Vivienne.” Luchette lunged for Vivienne and hugged her, crying on her shoulder.

I wondered if this was the right way, if telling her I was here would be better than her wandering. What if she wanted to come here after hearing of this place?

The fear of thought gripped my heart; from what the lady said, they will both come here eventually, but that didn't mean I wanted them to come now. They should live first.

I tried petting Luchette's long black hair, but my hand just passed through. Can't pass through dirt but pass through people? Such a bullshit concept.

“Maybe this isn't a good idea, Vivi,” I said.

“No, this is better. I see the future where I don't do this and Mom isn't happy.” She can see the future too? How amazing exactly is she?

Luchette raised her head, her nose was runny and her eyes red, and looked around.

“Who are you talking to, Vivi?” she asked.

“With Dad, he's here as a ghost!” she pointed at me.

“Honey…” she pulled her into a tighter hug.

“No, I am telling the truth. Dad, tell me something you shouldn't be able to know!” she declared smugly.

I stayed silent. I still felt this wasn't right. I wanted to talk to Luchette, but I could wait until she died. The feeling of thinking that sent a shiver down my spine; I still wasn't used to the whole being dead part.

“Dad, trust me, I've always been right!” Vivienne yelled.

She was always right. Honestly, I never saw this kid fail at anything. We thought we had a genius on our hands, but I guess we had a shaman daughter, probably. Whatever Vivienne was.

I felt that I could trust her with this too.

“Well, tell her that I still remember when she tried paying me after our first date.” A big misunderstanding where she thought I was a ‘Hire-a-boyfriend’ service; we never spoke of it to anyone, a small marriage secret. I smiled at the memory.

Vivienne side-eyed me with a weird look on her face.

“Dad says you tried paying him for your first date.”

Luchette stopped crying instantly.

“Is he really here?” She looked around wildly. I lowered myself to stand in front of her.

  
 Luchette immediately turned to stare right at me, or at least at my torso.

“He’s right in front of me, isn't he?”

“Yes,” feeling the air in front of her with her hands.

“Yeah,” Vivienne smiled brightly, “I think you can sense Aftervill a bit too! Maybe I can train you to see Dad!” She jumped up and down with excitement.

I really can't wait to talk to my wife now, who's probably also a shaman in training or something.

A single dad here to your typical moody teenager who is almost always tired and mostly surviving on some kind of caffeine related energy drink (I know they are awful for you but apparently I don't like coffee which, frankly, is highly inconvenient) and yet in amongst the chaos of a mundane life still somehow feels little bit lonely and would like some form of companionship.

However if you look past the chaos I'm a pretty normal bloke into what most people would call fairly normal stuff. I'll watch almost any film going, mostly to escape reality to be honest, listen to mainly rock/metal and pop punk music as a standard alongside some totally tragic 90's pop here and there, add in a very small dose of gaming (not that I have time for that now),a slightly less than healthy obsession with a football team that will give me a heart attack one day and some long hair and you have me in a nutshell.

1o44tp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o44tp6/ro_hr_humming_a_tune/,[RO] [HR] Humming a Tune,"Her tune graces my soul once more. I could listen to her symphony for eternity. The harmony of her hums are graceful. Her composition of the finest sounds is a privilege I often forget to appreciate. A talented composer that chose to share her pieces with me. On a soothing snowy evening as such, I am gifted by God the chance to hold a songbird that entranced my ears. I will never let go.

“You look quite divine tonight, my darling,” I whisper into her ears. She grins and lays her cheek against mine. My heart begins to slow, relaxed in her presence. I could stay here forever on this sofa, holding the light of my life. She has said little tonight, but from her glow to her scent, I am in paradise. She whispers back, “I love you so, and I regret every moment I am not with you. I promise I will spend every day making it right, my love.” My smile deepens with love. I truly am blessed. To live such an adoring life. For every instant I suffered, hidden in my hole, she would come around the corner to embrace me. I’ve yet to care for the life I had before her. Of desperation, procrastination, and haste. To fear judgement of my reputation, my career, my ‘shining’ accomplishments. All my friends and family had held contempt for my being. I could see it in their eyes. Never a word spoken but always presented. No such man holds a flat scowl towards someone they respect.

I could never accuse them of such, they tell lies of care and love for me. Always withholding their selfish thoughts. Children of God born of one emotion. An open mind would sense I am living in the wind. Simply enjoying the delights that surround us. It’s natural to envy those that live life as a fairytale. Never my beloved darling. Not a flash of envy, pride, or disillusion with me. Always that same beautiful grin, withholding her love behind it. I had dreamt of finding such love since I could walk. Never an astronaut, a doctor, or a lawyer. Just a dumb fool enamoured with his turtle dove. When my superiors removed me, I felt lost once more. My roommate worried whether I could pay rent, or with my father questioning my drive. In angst and desperation, she came around anew. I understood she would be busy, filled with duties that I fear to question. With a drop of a hat, she would hold me in her warmth. 

“You will find another home soon, my love. You are protected in my embrace.” My heart slows further more. My lungs fill slowly with the air I share with her. I cuddle her tightly, despite my numb limbs. “You are everything I had begged from God. A post I can lean on when I am troubled, a tree I can sleep peacefully under.” I softly spoke. She leans in to kiss my blue lips. The warmth of our lips sharing brings my body the peace it needs. The space it needs to breathe and bleed so comfortably. She leans back and stares with her eyes, one resembling the smooth seas nearby, and the other of warm coffee. Her soul glimmers in front of me, calming my spirits once more. I go to touch her cheek, lay my fingers upon her cheekbone. The heat of her visage embraces my cold, freezing fingers. I can not feel any more than a cold winter’s night, yet her cozy figure contradicts that. “I love you so, and I promise I will make it right, my love.” I blink and my eyes fail to adjust. 

My bed now warm of love and satisfaction, I gaze at the spirited soul resting beside me. A thick comforter, a warm scent, and a soft tune whistling on my record player. A sight to behold, my heart grows tight. I must be feeling ecstatic love and joy for it to overwhelm my chest as such. Despite the pain, I move closer to my darling. The movement required to scale a few inches across this mattress is near to climbing mount everest. Yet once I found the strength to lay my arms around her and hold her tight, I felt right once more. The pain lingered yet I cared no longer. I know she heard me. Felt me staging music murder to be where I am. She grabs my limbs and wraps them further around her. “You must hold me tighter than that, show me you care, my love.” I wanted to respond, but I couldn't. My arms are frail, with little room to give. My tongue now numb, can’t expel the poetry I desire. She giggles and faces me. 

“I know, my love, I can hear you. We’re alone at the edge of a universe, humming a tune.” Her grin burns deeply into my heart and brings temporary remedy to what was the equivalent of an elephant sitting on my chest. I love you my darling, in our garden of imagination, we frolic, we gaze, and we slept. Through every hardship, judgement, and anguish we endured, we will always have one another. She smiles wider than before, more than I had ever seen. “Your success and failures may have been yours but mine to burden. You are mine here, in the next universe, as well as the next life. We are never meant to part.” I love you so much. I can’t spit these words out, the sounds of gurgles and chokes resemble my tune. Her smile grows evermore. She is aware of my adoration. 

I can no longer move. I can’t feel the warmth of the room nor revolt against these limitations. I am akin to a statue. She moves me, lays me on my back, facing the ceiling. She places a soft kiss on my left cheek, yet I cry for I can not feel its warmth. My darling gazes at me, “It’s now and never, here, a reverie endeavor.” She points to the ceiling, it peels away to show the beautiful night sky. Despite what would have been several floors above my room is now the aurora borealis. An ecstatic display of colors, shining across my gaze, from green, purple, as well as hints of red, I am witnessing heaven. Her mismatched eyes of the sea and chocolate gaze upon me. In euphoric scenes such as this, I am inclined to take my naloxone, such beauty can be deadly. She holds the bottle of security and lightly tosses it across the room.

“Believe me, my love. The stars were made for falling, like melting obelisks, as tall as another realm.” The last sensation I have within my grasp is now amiss. I can no longer breathe. The necessity of inhale to exhale is gone and I feel quite peaceful. She holds me tightly, her left arm across my chest, and she whispers, “So long, so far, until it’s time.” 

My vision begins to falter, I can no longer see before me. It flashes of several colors including those I had never witnessed. No longer am I restricted with limbs, floating through this epileptic void. I had never felt so free, soaring like a bird through this unrestricted space. The colors flash around me, resembling my emotions across. Forming different shapes, hearts for her, or narrow triangles that I can barely glide through, as well as drooping curves I can grind across. Within a blink, I am back in my room. No night sky, no music, no sign of her.  I try to move, smell, even breathe. No response. It’s jarring, to feel no signs of effort across my figure. I want to scream, I want to run, cry, do whatever that makes me feel better. In times like this, she would hold me still. What a lovely idea. What a beautiful thought. I thought to myself in prayer, “My darling please, I believe you, help me in my time of need.”

In doing so, I steadily rose.

Though the feeling of movement pleases me, I notice I am rising out of my frame. I may have awoken from my paralysis, however I am left separate. I stand up right next to my bed, and witness the naloxone on the ground. I saw a discolored hand that had tried to claw for it. My gaze follows the paper skin and blisters up the limb, and stare at what once was. The face discolored as well, with blue lips, clammy skin, and pinpoint pupils. A bloated mass with stiff muscles and fluids across the bed. Overgrown nails and peeling on the face. Dark liquid pouring out the nose and mouth, I can’t imagine the scent. A familiar landscape that I get to witness without a mirror. I want to feel fear, to feel anxiety, and even shock at what lies before me. Yet I feel peaceful. I walk around the room, completely lightweight, it is quite sensational. I attempt to see my form in the mirror yet there is little to be had. I feel strong, quick, healthy, yet there is no visual to accompany that. 

I go to grab the knob of my bedroom door, but to no avail. I can not see my hand desperately attempt to grab it, yet I can feel the sensation of such. Such a curious feeling, I decided to try walking through the door itself. It’s out of the ordinary to see oneself in an outside perspective, it’s another to waltz through objects seamlessly. 

My apartment is quite empty. Scatters of trash and leftover food I had forgotten to put away. Roaches crawl across, flies hover what’s left, and a mountain of dishes. I see little signs of activity across my humble abode. I have little recollection of the previous night, and I would assume she would’ve tidied up the house before leaving. I am all alone here. In what should be my place of safety and security, I am starting to feel panicked. I am alone. No one is here. I can’t be in solitude. It’s puzzling that she left me here. My roommate is nowhere to be found, and the one being in all of the universe, that I adore, is missing. Everytime I needed to see her, she appeared. 

“Darling! I have arisen! Come see me, my heart!” No one came. I dashed around lightly across the apartment. Every room, nook and cranny, yet her caramel mane and mismatched gaze can not be found. Within this decade, I found peace and comfort in every terrible event that I came across. Through her, and her alone. When my mother had passed, when my dog had ran, or when my friends had left, she was there. Standing by around every corner ready to embrace me. I love this woman. I love her so much. She couldn’t have abandoned me, she always says goodbye. Come home, my love, please. “Oh my darling please! I can not live without you! I beg you to be by my side!”

I can not count the time that went by. I had laid here on my sofa for what feels like eons now. I have cried for eternity, tears that could drown the thirsty, sorrow that could dampen the optimists, yet nothing has changed. Countless people have come and gone through my nest, different ages and different strokes. The sofa changed a thousand times but always in the same spot. I have yet to discover why I can not leave my apartment. The door is physical against me, yet I can walk through the inner walls of the apartment. If this wretched prison had released me, I would run thousands of miles across this realm to find her again. I couldn’t say what I would do. Whether I would hug her tightly or scream in frustration like a child. Her beautiful smile shines through my mind. I would give anything to see it again.

I begin to hum softly to the same tune she had sung a thousand times before. The only tune that has kept me sane all this time.

A siren sounds like the goddess

Who promises endless apologies of paradise

And only she can make it right

So things are different tonight.

I always find myself initiating texts and plans. We were supposed to go out for a concert, but she got sick and canceled it, especially without rescheduling or asking about new plans. I feel bad because I keep texting her, and while she's mainly reactive to my texts, she takes forever. I last texted her Wednesday, and she hasn't responded yet (it's Saturday). Is this relationship worth it, also I haven't told her my feelings towards her.

Backstory:

My (25F) friend invited me to her graduation party in mid-August, and one of her relatives was there, we'll call her Diana (25F). I was the only person who was not related to her who was invited to my friend's party. I interacted with Diana a little bit. At this graduation party, I found out Diana is bi, mainly because she was outed by her aunt. Anyways, I felt a certain way about Diana, and I found her social media, reached out to her there, asked her out for coffee/initiated planning the meetup, and got her number. We actually met up in late August, the meetup was 2 hours from both of us (we live 4 hours away). We had an 8 hour date (?), where we had food, walked around, and talked. I even came out to her. On this meetup, I learned/noticed that Diana 1) talks extremely quietly, even when we're walking around or eating 2) avoids eye contact 3) does not express emotions/has a ""flat affect"" (e.g. when she finds something funny, she hides her laughs) 4) has to be set up to date by her friends and 5) does not use her phone much. Also, while waiting for the food at the restaurants, she would bring out her diary/journal and would write in it, or read her book. This happened 3 times. Also, after she learned about my sexuality, she started talking to me more and asking me more personal questions.

So Diana is in a graduate program that involves a lot of reading and writing, and from my understanding, is working several jobs as well. Before we went out for coffee, she had finished her 2nd week of school. Since going out for coffee, I would text her, and she'd eventually started taking a while to respond. I kind of attributed this to maybe her feeling tired from her responsibilities. I was okay with the slower texts, as long she was texting me, answering my questions, and inquiring about me. Well, I ask her if she wants to do something together again, and I take the reins on planning. We decide to go to a classical music concert, in early October, and we each pay $90 for tickets. Basically, I also ask about if she wanted to do other things apart from the concert, and I make plans based on whatever she says we can do.

So anyways, the concert date is approaching. Our texts are pretty slow and spaced out, but she brings up the concert and that she's excited for it. The day before the concert, though, I let her know about parking and other logistics planning stuff, and she's agreeing. I think everything is going fine, until she agrees to plans and then immediately says she's not feeling well (she had to leave work early) and that she may not be able to go to the concert. I'm a bit sad, but I decide to check-in on her the morning of the concert, and ultimately, she tells me she's not going to the concert because of how sick she feels, and that she wants me to enjoy the concert without her. I actually don't end up going, and the next day I get a text from her asking about the concert. I tell her very honestly I didn't go because I felt sad, and she apologizes. I divert the conversation to school, and she tells me she's struggling with school.

Now, the last time we've texted was Wednesday night. It's Saturday and I'm still waiting for her text. I haven't told her how I feel about her (I really like her), and the last conversation was sort of about school. I hope things aren't over between us, but what are the next steps I could take? I hope this is not over.

I built a simple quiz that helps figure out which dairy-free milk works best for your needs - whether you're using it for coffee, cooking, smoothies, or just drinking straight.

It factors in taste preferences, dietary priorities (protein, sustainability, budget, allergens), and texture to give you a personalized match.

I just want to give you my quick journey showdown of how I’m on the way to get my dream life alongside with my SP!

So basically a month ago, we broke up w my SP right before moving to another city, where we’d be together. I had terrible time from the start (smoking pack a day, not going to gym, eating like shit and spending my money lavishly - even though I was at AirBnB) and then i started manifesting hard

Manifested signs - I saw them, kept me going (people telling me her name, angel numbers that i saw with tarot card readers (yes you heard me, was fun haha))

Manifested that “somebody will be feeling weak, but something great is gonna happen” - the friend that i’ve met, day later she tells me exactly “i feel weak” and right after, I got an offer at a job that would put me financially ahead and independent from my parents

I got a ROOM that looked like my SATS which i started doing like a week ago! (Balcony, bed position, mirror and a curtain with high ceiling) and a landlord which is such a sweetheart! (Also a fellow manifestor - Hi Zarina!)

Since yesterday when I moved here, I’m kinda enjoying it - decorating my room, playing music and enjoying the weekend before i start working, but i feel like the last piece is missing, which is my SP

I feel like I’ve manifested my life all correctly, but with her i feel like I manifested the waiting room - the state of actually anticipating it (like when you order a coffee) rather than having it right now. I know it sounds silly to come from my position, but did someone also felt like this or went through this? Or any possible advice or insights, I do SATS and i really enjoy it i feel giddy hehe, but i just find it hard to “have it” while we are in NC.

Any thoughts would be helpful, thank you and happy manifesting!

1o44pqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1o44pqq/we_loved_singapore/,We loved Singapore,"My husband and I travelled to Singapore for 7 days with our young kids (7&3). We had a great time and loved Singapore.

Here's our itinerary -

**Day 1 (Mon)**  
1:20 p.m.	Landed in Singapore  
4:00 p.m. Hotel Check-in - we stayed at **Lyn Funan**. We loved out stay here. The hotel was extremely clean. There were many things for the kids to explore, within the hotel as well as in the mall the hotel was located in. We can get to the MRT station from the hotel through an underground walkway. We stayed in a 2-bedroom with a kitchenette. Worked perfectly for our family.  
6-10 p.m. Mid-Autumn Festival @ **Gardens by the Bay**

**Day 2 (Tue)**  
Breakfast at True Breakfast  
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. - **keppel centre for art education** \- a great place for kids to explore and spend a few hours. Entry is free.  
1 p.m. to 4 p.m. - Lunch & nap  
4 p.m. to 7 p.m. **ArtScience Museum** \- All of us had fun. I highly recommend it.  
Dinner @ Kapitan

**Day 3 (Wed)**  
Brunch @ Common Man Coffee Roasters  
Shopping at **Orchard Road**  
4 p.m. - 7 p.m. **China Town** (Loved the dumplings @ Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao)

**Day 4 (Thur)**  
Took cab to the **zoo**. reached \~9a.m.  - Until now we solely used **public transportation** (MRT and bus). My husband and I love walking around and using public transportation and Singapore proved excellent for that. We did not get a tourist travel card. We bought three EZ link cards (loaded 20 SGD in each) and my 3yo got a dummy card that she could use to tag on and off at MRT stations and buses. I think carrying their own cards in their tiny bags and tagging it on and off was most probably the biggest highlight of this trip for my kids.

9:30 a.m. Elephant feeding - you need to book this ahead of time.  
10.30 a.m. Splash Safari presentation  
12 p.m. Into the wild presentation  
12:30 - 1:30 - Lunch  
2 p.m. Animal Friends Presentation  
2:30 Tram Ride  
3:15 - Carousel rides  
3:45 - giraffe feeding. booked ahead of time.  
4:30 - 5 pm - Water play

There was a lot of walking around and exploring in between everything I've mentioned above.  
The zoo was great. I highly recommend it.

**Day 5 (Fri)**  
9 a.m. Bus+Sentosa Express to Oceanarium  
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. - **Oceanarium** \- Loved it!  
2:30 to 4 p.m. - Lunch @ Din Tai Fung  
5 p.m. to 6 p.m. **Luge** \- HIGHLY recommend it. What fun! My 7yo got to drive by herself and what fun she had! My 3yo rode in front of me.  
6 p.m. to 7 p.m. - **Siloso Beach**  
7:40 **Wings of Time Show** \- Worth the money. We all enjoyed it.  
Sentosa Express +Bus back to Lyf funan  
  
**Day 6 (Sat)**  
Brunch @ Punch  
1:30 - 3:30 pm play time and **art workshop Chokmah Gallery** at Funan mall. What the kids created in the art workshop ended up being our only souvenirs from Singapore.  
4:30 - 5:30 early dinner at Casa Vostra - Raffles City  
5:30 to 7 p.m. MRT and Khatib shuttle to **Night Safari**  \- My kids LOVED it. This was the most fun my elder one had during the trip.   
7:30 - 7:50 - creatures of the night show  
8:15 to 9:00 p.m. - Night safari tram ride  
9 to 11 p.m. Pangolin Trail >> Leopard Trail >> East Lodge Trail >> Tasmanian Devil Trail  
11:15 pm shuttle to Khatib MRT  
Took cab from Khatib MRT to Lyf Funan because the trains were not running by the time we reached the station.

**Day 7 (Sun)**  
Brunch  
Play time @ Lyf Funan  
MRT to airport. Left Singapore at 11 p.m.  
My original plan was to reach the airport in the morning and explore The Jewel. But instead we decided to take it super slow and had a lazy day. Perfect end to a lovely trip.

what we would like to visit/do on our next trip:  
science center  
river cruise  
cloud forest and flower dome  
gardens by the bay - childrens section  
singapore flyer and time capsule  
changi airport - jewel  
Helix bridge  
bird park  
spectra show  
Marina bay sands observatory  
Jacob Ballas children's garden

Our trip (airfare - origin: India, stay, food, attractions tickets, misc expenses) in total cost us about **5,000 SGD**.  
I planned the trip in such a way that we were not out in the sun too much around early afternoon when it was hottest. This and afternoon naps ensured that the kids did not tire out fast during the long days.  
For various reasons, many people say that SG is not such a great place to travel to. But for my family, it cannot get better than SG right now.

Please feel free to ask me any other questions you may have.

1o44pa6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o44pa6,RollerPro Review - From the Perspective of a Photographer and Business Traveler,"All, it's finally here.  Another review from another random person on the internet.  Am I going to say the exact same things as everyone else?  Who knows?  Read on to find out...cause..that's why you're here right?

Disclaimer:  This review is not for you if you've ever had these disparaging thoughts

\- Why would I buy this bag when (other company, Tumi, Samsonite, B&R,etc) has a bag that's so much better and cheaper?

\- This is thing is so expensive and just not worth it and you can't convince me otherwise

\- I want to compare this thing to bags that are bigger/heavier/smaller/lighter completely different in many ways, but somehow I still believe it's a good comparison

\- I can't believe how heavy this thing is, there's no way I can use this for international travel

\- The whole kickstarter thing rubs me the wrong way and I'm already pissed at PD for some reason

\- I think this post is a shill post and my internet rabidness is already peaking through my undies

Ok, if you're still here...welcome and check out this post for my thoughts on this bag months ago when I hung out at a PD store for an hour playing with a display model.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/peakdesign/comments/1j6rinx/went\_to\_the\_nyc\_store\_played\_with\_the\_roller\_pro/](https://www.reddit.com/r/peakdesign/comments/1j6rinx/went_to_the_nyc_store_played_with_the_roller_pro/)

Now that the bag has finally arrived, and I picked the Eclipse Maroon version, my first impression is LOVE!!

This review is being posted after I've already taken a few trips with the bag.  I am a business professional who travels for work but also a part time professional photographer.  I felt like this bag was made specifically for me and I was excited to have it come into existence.  My normal EDC is a Monos Carry On Plus Hybrid.

**Does it fit everything the Monos can fit?**

Let's be honest, the only time I care whether or not my bag can fit what I need is when I need to over pack it for a trip to avoid packing a bigger suitcase.  Otherwise, I'd use a bigger suitcase.  The answer is not quite.  But, it's maybe 5% less stuffable.

**Whatabout the Wheels**

**S**moother than Monos, too smooth, bag rolls away, bigger too.  MOST IMPORTANTLY...destroys carpets.  I mean, no more fear of rolling over carpets from this guy.

Check out these short vids of this thing running away from me, dancing like no one's looking, and just sneaking away

[https://imgur.com/a/5aTTLiC](https://imgur.com/a/5aTTLiC)

**Am I gonna lose my mind over the Zipper?**

Everyone knows, kinda weakish, but no issues yet even overstuff

**Design, just sexy as hell, love the red**

Arch Opening - It's just different.  I've gotten really good at opening clamshells on those standard luggage holders.   This is no different than normal bags that open front to back, except rotated left to right.  There are situations where it's easier to open and others where it's just as awkward

**Handle, no wobble, smooth as butter?**

No, the thing wobbles...a bit...and that's fucking ok.   If it didn't wobble, it'd probably break off.  It's called tolerance.  PD screwed themselves on this one, showing a vid of supposed no wobble.  Wobble is normal.  Too much wobble isn't...but seriously, who the da fuck cares.  I need the handle to not come off, that's it.

**What about the price?**

For the retail price on this bag when comparing to a normal travel bag made by pretty much any other bag company, my answer is that this bag is too expensive.  You're paying a premium for brand loyalty, the recoup of R&D, the likely margins needed to create capital so Peak can continue creating new stuff, and maybe some failure in market research on where this thing should be priced.

For the discounted price, you're supporting PD because you like the company

A fair price for this bag in my opinion is $349.99 for its market segment.  Which is between dedicated camera bag companies (e.g think tank) and direct to consumer luggage (away, monos, etc).  This bag should not be compared to commodoity luggage (samsonite) or high end luggage (e.g B&R, Rimowa)

Hope this helps you...and if you feel any rage and got this far...feel free to not comment and just move on with your life.  Grab a coffee...buy a samsonite.  Peace be with you.

Also, ask me anything...happy to help.  ",6,1760211498.0,peakdesign,0,0.8,False

There’s not much I can do to solve it but maybe it will make people aware of how they’re coming across.

Lately I’ve noticed more and more people showing up with their own drinks. It drives me crazy!  Not only does their giant Starbucks cup sitting around ruin the aesthetic, but it comes off as they don’t think what I have to offer is good enough for them.  I even ask people (if it’s a repetitive gathering) what kind of tea or coffee they prefer so I can be sure to have it available when they come.  I grew up in a big hosting family/tea drinking family and we always had coffee or tea with our dessert after dinner and people always turn that down too. Oh well. I don’t mind if people bring water because I understand having to track the ounces you’re drinking in a day but I find it so annoying when people bring their own beverage to an event where there will obviously be drinks offered.

1o44nw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/1o44nw3/notes_from_our_late_september_portuguese_camino/,Notes from our late September Portuguese Camino,"We did our Portuguese Camino from Porto in late September. We did it a little more platinum than most, I think. No regrets. Here are some of our notes from the walk in case they might be helpful to someone else.  

\-  We flew into Porto. The metro from Porto airport is easy to take into town. The stop on the airport line closest to the cathedral is Trindade. Make sure you touch the metro card to the post (not sure what it is called) near the entrance before boarding. When buying the ticket for more than one person, make it two transactions or it will put the 2^(nd) ticket on the same card. You may be able to touch the card to the pole twice if you do make that mistake.

\- Lots of good vegan restaurants in Porto: da Terra (nicer place), Verde Hut (buffet – mostly Indian). Also, there are several small groceries where you can get peanut butter, bread, fruit and vegetables (MyAuchan, Spar, Friose). There are many good vegan restaurants along the trail. We used Happy Cow and Google Maps to find them. As a last resort, we would go to Burger King and have the vegetarian sandwich. We think it is vegan unless you object to it being cooked on the same grill as the meat sandwiches.

\- For lunch along the trail, we had a few “pilgrim set meals,” which were fine, but if the weather is nice, it’s cheaper and enjoyable to stop into a village grocery store and get bread, fruit, etc. and have a picnic. Often the small villages only have 1-2 cafes, which can be overwhelmed with pilgrims.

\- Albuergues – I didn’t enjoy it. Very nice host and pilgrims. But, getting sleep was difficult in main rooms. Also, always worried about bed bugs (never saw any). So, after staying in a better rated one we didn’t enjoy, we decided the price difference for private rooms off [booking.com](http://booking.com) and Airbnb was small enough just to do that. If you don’t plan to stay in albergues, pack weight can be very low, as you really only need a couple of outfits, layers, rain gear, toiletries, water, and snacks. No need to bring a water filter, sleeping bag, towel, shampoo, etc. As a consequence, arranging for pack transfer is an unnecessary logistical task. It would be easy to get pack weight to 10 pounds or less.

\- Clothes washing – A couple of our stays had a washer and dryer but normally we just found a laundromat (lavanderia) and took the hour to wash them there. Keep in mind, laundromat washing machines add detergent automatically in Europe, so no need to buy or bring your own. The machines cost 4-6 euro for the wash and 1-3 euro for the dryer.

\- We decided not to participate in the clam shell, passport stamping, and credential acquisition at the end. The clam shell and credential mostly because it would just be one more thing for the kids to get rid of when we die. The passport stamps become a distraction to the hike. You start to do things/go places just to get a stamp, seemed to take away from it all.

\- Conditioning – We had taken several long walks in the week or two leading up to the Camino including some more than 20 miles. I think that helped a lot. Nevertheless, we found that our feet got sore in ways we had not experienced before. We treated a couple of minor blisters with tape and toe socks and they went away without issue. I think I would spend more time strengthening my feet including improving balance before going next time. Many other pilgrims seemed to have foot problems/blisters and knee problems. I was also surprised at how much the cobblestones affected my feet. The constant changing of angles that you are stepping on really does a number on your feet.

\- We took the Litoral route out of Porto and found it was a great walk along the river and coast. We walked to Vila de Conde on the first day, then crossed back over to the Central route using the river route from Vila de Conde to Barcelinhos/Barcelos via Rates. That route was a lot of road walks, some very tight to traffic, but it worked.

\- Since we had made good time and had extra days, we took the Spiritual Variant. I recommend this route. The first day has a good climb. The payoff is the second day going down from the peak to the city where you get the boat ride to Padron. It runs along a really magical creek in a green tunnel of trees, something straight out of Lord of the Rings movie. Boat on spiritual variant: there are 2 big boats per day; book ahead if you want the later boat; get there early, as seating is first-come, first-serve; boat can be cold, so have layers handy. The boat ride was cramped and loud/lively. I didn’t enjoy it, but it was worth it to enjoy the beauty of the Spiritual Variant walk. They have coffee and little cake slices, but it’s not great. You have to store your packs in the hold, so at the end there is a queue to get your pack to get off the boat.

\- Once you cross into Spain, it is harder to find restaurants open between 4pm-8pm (which is when we usually arrived hungry). So it takes a little more planning. In addition, as the Coastal and Central routes come together in Tui and new pilgrims start their camino, the route gets more crowded and rooms are harder to find in and after Tui. We could reserve a room at lunch time before Tui. After it, we had to arrange the room the day before. 

\-  We checked one of our packs on the flights to/from and used a $5 Ikea zippered bag to protect it during the flights, both directions. Held up well. 

All together it took us 10.5 days and 175 miles of hiking. Great walk, I highly recommend it. Enjoy. ",1,1760211407.0,CaminoDeSantiago,0,1.0,False

The harmony of her hums are graceful. Her composition of the finest sounds is a privilege I often forget to appreciate. A talented composer that chose to share her pieces with me. On a soothing snowy evening as such, I am gifted by God the chance to hold a songbird that entranced my ears. I will never let go.

“You look quite divine tonight, my darling,” I whisper into her ears. She grins and lays her cheek against mine. My heart begins to slow, relaxed in her presence. I could stay here forever on this sofa, holding the light of my life. She has said little tonight, but from her glow to her scent, I am in paradise. She whispers back, “I love you so, and I regret every moment I am not with you. I promise I will spend every day making it right, my love.” My smile deepens with love. I truly am blessed. To live such an adoring life. For every instant I suffered, hidden in my hole, she would come around the corner to embrace me. I’ve yet to care for the life I had before her. Of desperation, procrastination, and haste. To fear judgement of my reputation, my career, my ‘shining’ accomplishments. All my friends and family had held contempt for my being. I could see it in their eyes. Never a word spoken but always presented. No such man holds a flat scowl towards someone they respect.

 I could never accuse them of such, they tell lies of care and love for me. Always withholding their selfish thoughts. Children of God born of one emotion. An open mind would sense I am living in the wind. Simply enjoying the delights that surround us. It’s natural to envy those that live life as a fairytale. Never my beloved darling. Not a flash of envy, pride, or disillusion with me. Always that same beautiful grin, withholding her love behind it. I had dreamt of finding such love since I could walk. Never an astronaut, a doctor, or a lawyer. Just a dumb fool enamoured with his turtle dove. When my superiors removed me, I felt lost once more. My roommate worried whether I could pay rent, or with my father questioning my drive. In angst and desperation, she came around anew. I understood she would be busy, filled with duties that I fear to question. With a drop of a hat, she would hold me in her warmth. 

“You will find another home soon, my love. You are protected in my embrace.” My heart slows further more. My lungs fill slowly with the air I share with her. I cuddle her tightly, despite my numb limbs. “You are everything I had begged from God. A post I can lean on when I am troubled, a tree I can sleep peacefully under.” I softly spoke. She leans in to kiss my blue lips. The warmth of our lips sharing brings my body the peace it needs. The space it needs to breathe and bleed so comfortably. She leans back and stares with her eyes, one resembling the smooth seas nearby, and the other of warm coffee. Her soul glimmers in front of me, calming my spirits once more. I go to touch her cheek, lay my fingers upon her cheekbone. The heat of her visage embraces my cold, freezing fingers. I can not feel any more than a cold winter’s night, yet her cozy figure contradicts that. “I love you so, and I promise I will make it right, my love.” I blink and my eyes fail to adjust. 

My bed now warm of love and satisfaction, I gaze at the spirited soul resting beside me. A thick comforter, a warm scent, and a soft tune whistling on my record player. A sight to behold, my heart grows tight. I must be feeling ecstatic love and joy for it to overwhelm my chest as such. Despite the pain, I move closer to my darling. The movement required to scale a few inches across this mattress is near to climbing mount everest. Yet once I found the strength to lay my arms around her and hold her tight, I felt right once more. The pain lingered yet I cared no longer. I know she heard me. Felt me staging music murder to be where I am. She grabs my limbs and wraps them further around her. “You must hold me tighter than that, show me you care, my love.” I wanted to respond, but I couldn't. My arms are frail, with little room to give. My tongue now numb, can’t expel the poetry I desire. She giggles and faces me. 

“I know, my love, I can hear you. We’re alone at the edge of a universe, humming a tune.” Her grin burns deeply into my heart and brings temporary remedy to what was the equivalent of an elephant sitting on my chest. I love you my darling, in our garden of imagination, we frolic, we gaze, and we slept. Through every hardship, judgement, and anguish we endured, we will always have one another. She smiles wider than before, more than I had ever seen. “Your success and failures may have been yours but mine to burden. You are mine here, in the next universe, as well as the next life. We are never meant to part.” I love you so much. I can’t spit these words out, the sounds of gurgles and chokes resemble my tune. Her smile grows evermore. She is aware of my adoration. 

I can no longer move. I can’t feel the warmth of the room nor revolt against these limitations. I am akin to a statue. She moves me, lays me on my back, facing the ceiling. She places a soft kiss on my left cheek, yet I cry for I can not feel its warmth. My darling gazes at me, “It’s now and never, here, a reverie endeavor.” She points to the ceiling, it peels away to show the beautiful night sky. Despite what would have been several floors above my room is now the aurora borealis. An ecstatic display of colors, shining across my gaze, from green, purple, as well as hints of red, I am witnessing heaven. Her mismatched eyes of the sea and chocolate gaze upon me. In euphoric scenes such as this, I am inclined to take my naloxone, such beauty can be deadly. She holds the bottle of security and lightly tosses it across the room.

“Believe me, my love. The stars were made for falling, like melting obelisks, as tall as another realm.” The last sensation I have within my grasp is now amiss. I can no longer breathe. The necessity of inhale to exhale is gone and I feel quite peaceful. She holds me tightly, her left arm across my chest, and she whispers, “So long, so far, until it’s time.” 

My vision begins to falter, I can no longer see before me. It flashes of several colors including those I had never witnessed. No longer am I restricted with limbs, floating through this epileptic void. I had never felt so free, soaring like a bird through this unrestricted space. The colors flash around me, resembling my emotions across. Forming different shapes, hearts for her, or narrow triangles that I can barely glide through, as well as drooping curves I can grind across. Within a blink, I am back in my room. No night sky, no music, no sign of her.  I try to move, smell, even breathe. No response. It’s jarring, to feel no signs of effort across my figure. I want to scream, I want to run, cry, do whatever that makes me feel better. In times like this, she would hold me still. What a lovely idea. What a beautiful thought. I thought to myself in prayer, “My darling please, I believe you, help me in my time of need.”

In doing so, I steadily rose.

Though the feeling of movement pleases me, I notice I am rising out of my frame. I may have awoken from my paralysis, however I am left separate. I stand up right next to my bed, and witness the naloxone on the ground. I saw a discolored hand that had tried to claw for it. My gaze follows the paper skin and blisters up the limb, and stare at what once was. The face discolored as well, with blue lips, clammy skin, and pinpoint pupils. A bloated mass with stiff muscles and fluids across the bed. Overgrown nails and peeling on the face. Dark liquid pouring out the nose and mouth, I can’t imagine the scent. A familiar landscape that I get to witness without a mirror. I want to feel fear, to feel anxiety, and even shock at what lies before me. Yet I feel peaceful. I walk around the room, completely lightweight, it is quite sensational. I attempt to see my form in the mirror yet there is little to be had. I feel strong, quick, healthy, yet there is no visual to accompany that. 

I go to grab the knob of my bedroom door, but to no avail. I can not see my hand desperately attempt to grab it, yet I can feel the sensation of such. Such a curious feeling, I decided to try walking through the door itself. It’s out of the ordinary to see oneself in an outside perspective, it’s another to waltz through objects seamlessly. 

My apartment is quite empty. Scatters of trash and leftover food I had forgotten to put away. Roaches crawl across, flies hover what’s left, and a mountain of dishes. I see little signs of activity across my humble abode. I have little recollection of the previous night, and I would assume she would’ve tidied up the house before leaving. I am all alone here. In what should be my place of safety and security, I am starting to feel panicked. I am alone. No one is here. I can’t be in solitude. It’s puzzling that she left me here. My roommate is nowhere to be found, and the one being in all of the universe, that I adore, is missing. Everytime I needed to see her, she appeared. 

“Darling! I have arisen! Come see me, my heart!” No one came. I dashed around lightly across the apartment. Every room, nook and cranny, yet her caramel mane and mismatched gaze can not be found. Within this decade, I found peace and comfort in every terrible event that I came across. Through her, and her alone. When my mother had passed, when my dog had ran, or when my friends had left, she was there. Standing by around every corner ready to embrace me. I love this woman. I love her so much. She couldn’t have abandoned me, she always says goodbye. Come home, my love, please. “Oh my darling please! I can not live without you! I beg you to be by my side!”

I can not count the time that went by. I had laid here on my sofa for what feels like eons now. I have cried for eternity, tears that could drown the thirsty, sorrow that could dampen the optimists, yet nothing has changed. Countless people have come and gone through my nest, different ages and different strokes. The sofa changed a thousand times but always in the same spot. I have yet to discover why I can not leave my apartment. The door is physical against me, yet I can walk through the inner walls of the apartment. If this wretched prison had released me, I would run thousands of miles across this realm to find her again. I couldn’t say what I would do. Whether I would hug her tightly or scream in frustration like a child. Her beautiful smile shines through my mind. I would give anything to see it again.

I begin to hum softly to the same tune she had sung a thousand times before. The only tune that has kept me sane all this time.

A siren sounds like the goddess

Who promises endless apologies of paradise

And only she can make it right

So things are different tonight.

Or maybe you’re already there and feeling a bit... meh about it all? Trust me, you’re not alone! Life after 50 can feel a bit like getting into an SUV after driving a sports car for years—it's comfy, but where's the thrill? 

But here's a plot twist for you: **turning 50 could be the best thing that ever happened to you, especially when it comes to finding your purpose for retirement!** 🙌 Let’s shake off that ‘meh’ and dive into what really makes life worth living.

### What Are You Passionate About? 
This might sound like a cliché, but seriously, it’s time to get back to the things that make you *tick*. Ask yourself:

- **What hobbies did you love but set aside?**
- **Is there a dream you had but thought, ""Maybe when I'm older""? Now's the time!**
- **What are the big questions keeping you up at night?** 

### Going on an Adventure (of Life)
Retirement isn’t just about sipping margaritas by the pool (unless that’s your thing, then rock on!). Think of it as your chance for a little adventure in life. 

- **Consider volunteering:** Helping others can fill your heart and give you a new sense of purpose.
- **Travel:** I mean really, now is the time to explore those places you've only seen in pictures.
- **Learn a new skill:** Ever thought about painting, cooking classes, or even picking up a musical instrument? 🎸 

### The Importance of Reflection
Don't just jump into the next chapter; **take a sec to reflect.** Seriously, grab a journal and jot down your thoughts! What do you want this next phase to look like? Some prompts to get you rolling:

- What legacy do you want to leave?
- How can you inspire those around you?
- What does 'success' look like for you now?

### We Believe in Strongest People 💪
As we age, our journeys may seem daunting, but remember: **we believe in the strongest people.** You’ve built a life full of experience, so don’t let a number dictate your future. If you’re feeling stuck, there are communities and resources out there that can help you find that spark. Check out some guides, like [this one!](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb)

Throw in the quirks of life, the humor in every mishap, and the joy of every success. Imagine sitting on the porch with your friends, sipping coffee, and sharing stories about your adventures. Sound nice? 

As we navigate this journey together and embrace the changes and challenges, let's create **the narrative we want**. So, whether you’re doing cartwheels into retirement or just taking a leisurely stroll, remember that it’s never too late to discover your purpose. 🌈

And who knows? Maybe your best years are just ahead… What adventures do you think await you after 50?",1,1760211228.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

I am Simon, a 25yo med student from Austria currently in London for 2 months (until 29th Nov) because of an elective. Although being surrounded by people all day, I still feel kind of lonely here tbh. That's why I would love to meet new people to spend some time together and chat about anything really. I don't really enjoy the noisy and fast-paced life in big cities like London so I often tend to escape to parks in my freetime. 

I am pretty much a sports/nature person and am into hiking, trailrunning, rock climbing as well as all sorts of wintersports. As you might imagine, most of my hobbies are not an option here, so I have to stick to running atm☺️

I also like reading, watching films, cooking and playing boardgames. Moreover, I also got into anime crotcheting recently, which I enjoyed but I did not bring my equipment to London. 

I am not looking for a whole group of people just some good old 1:1 conversations about anything really. Ideally some, where neither of us feels the need to find an excuse to escape from it and where pauses actually feel easy, not awkward😉

I am also open to exploring the city a bit more, like visiting museums, grabbing some lunch/dinner/coffee together or exploring the night life here.

So basically just hit me up if you are in a similar position or just want to get to know and spend some time with new people.

Looking forward to meeting you soon!

We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but that was it

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son.  I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... (people from my country) are doing  bad work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy dropout students"" who were not able to do anything better or complex",0,1760211084.0,TwoHotTakes,5,0.33,False

I (27m) have always known that better looking men are treated better by women, I genuinely don't believe that anyone would disagree.

I see it everywhere in places such as pubs, clubs, coffee shops, events, online dating and (more recently) YouTube.

It's completely my fault for watching them, but my YouTube is filled with videos of handsome men essentially bragging about their dating/sex life.

In person, I've lost count of how often my friends can easily ""chat up"" women. Not due to their social skills, but simply because women find them more attractive than everyone else in the room, and therefore make it easy.

I'm not the worse looking man, but I'm certainly not recieving signs and interest. Until 24, I genuinely thought I'd be a virgin for life.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I was talking to a woman in the pub. Although the conversation was fine, it was extremely clear that it was platonic at best.

Suddenly, my good looking friend walked past, said ""alright?"" to her and then walked off, not saying anything else all night.

I completely forgot about it until around 1am, when he received the ""You up?x"" message from that same women.

1o44ehn,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1o44ehn/first_40_hours_done/,First 40 hours done!,"Hello hello — 31, female — MS (early stages//ocrevus) officially one year and six months steady.

Overweight? For sure.

My neurologist is skeptical (im skeptical of her too she can’t even pronounce sclerosis — while this is her major, anyway) will stick to small steps, being mindful and watchful. My GP is on board — though recommended electrolytes and stopping whenever something feels weird.

“What’s weird?” And she said “you’ll know.”

Studies suggest IF is good for people with Swiss-cheese brains, though need more research.

So here we are — Friday night 2.AM snacking again while maintaining my long-distance relationship (she usually eats around my night time, hence it just rubs off.)

Decided with how I’ve been feeling lately — this is not it.

I would like to lose somewhere between 66-77 pounds (30-35 kilos) — but most of all, practice a healthier lifestyle, see if my MS symptoms like fatigue become less.

I usually practice a very loose 14:10 lifestyle — I start eating when I’m hungry and generally that does not happen way past the  afternoon.

I’ve noticed after my biggest relapse, coming off steroids and eating little and hospital food for three days — how heavy food actually feels like, how it tires me and over the last year I cut most of my meals in half, don’t get snacks 
The less I eat, the better I feel — until I don’t?!

Probably because I never was exceptionally fasting or on purpose — and lacked to hydrate, get all those good vitamins and minerals in.

There’s been progress since I’ve left the fiancé,and moved into my own apartment.

I do have temptation, and if I do get sweets — they will likely be consumed. But I have caught myself stumbling upon forgotten peanuts, chocolate or a random bag of chips more often.

Which truly, never happened before in my life.
Cause I was a distress eater — emotionally consuming even if it never helped.

I figured — fuck it. Research shows promising outcomes to fasting during auto-immune diseases — so id figure with new and gebuinely better habits being picked up — I will start to fast. 
 
I bought  a lot of bottles of sparkling water (or I won’t drink it at all) cut down my coffee to 45 calories and rewriting this post cause I felt like it be better for me to keep track off — 
Got some isotone, some vitamins I need including magnesium and some B’s and D’s — And got that sea salt.

Looking for easy to get products at supermarkets things to prepare for a longer fast. Like handy stuff to have around just in case — cause I’m still fairly new to fasting rightfully and the wiki is a bit technical and overwhelming. 

But for now — I might or might not prolong this fast, im taking it day by day. And I’m not going to be upset if I break it. Cause I do want to be listening to my body. 

But after 43 hours — I kind of feel motivated to get up to Monday. 

Not my first rodeo — but first in years. Also down for other suggestions research — more easier to do, and more feasible when it comes down to auto-immune diseases.

A fast comes with risks if you do it poorly — so wise little eaters — come forth with your guidance.

Also after I’ve done this — im thinking of the 5:2 ratio. Since it showed some amazing life altering progress in MS fasting trials — and I think I could plan my life around it and keep this up — as I’m only now starting to really think about food. And it’s already been over 40 hours.

Day two was the hardest according to multiple posts?


Anyways, thanks.
I’ll be keeping track here.

But I don’t have such lofty expectations of anyone – including of myself. Let’s feel each other out to know what’s possible and what we’d like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

In regards to MBTI, I historically (since my teens) test as INTJ. More recently, I sometimes get INFJ. I've also gotten INTP and ISTJ before.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

I was just about to start talking to this girl I've developed a bit of a crush on. 

Context will be brief, but we have been studying together for about 4 weeks now, this Friday I ask if we could go for a walk together in our free time instead of studying. As we are leaving, we bump into a girl (semi friend of 17F) who asks us what we are doing, and I say we are going to get coffees and it's my treat; this was my plan all along. I was very relieved to be able to drop this before we got like 100 yards from the coffee shop. We go for a 1-hour 20-minute walk and chat about just about everything one can talk about at 17 years old, including relationships, which is where she drops that she's been on a few dates with this guy. She says she disliked an aspect of his conduct, and we branch off into a conversation about paying for dates, etc. Fast forward to Friday night, when I decide to message her and we start to chat, during which she calls me her friend. I decide to agree with her and say 'I'm glad we are on the same page' so as not to make the conversation awkward. Maybe I'm completely delusional and she is just being a friend (which I have no trouble accepting, I just find our chemistry something natural)

He is making arrangements in France with his social worker but he still has not had a place to live for 3 years.

This man has been staying with an abusive 56 yo host for 1 year. A moody, condescending, authoritarian man, a dictator, and worse, a castrator!  So there, in the morning my 75-year-old friend has to be woken up at 5:30 a.m. to have coffee with the host (forced to do so), then the host goes to work, locks his house, and puts the old man outside on the terrace until he returns from work.

 When he returns, he demands that the house be cleaned, and then around 6 p.m. he is put outside again on the terrace until 9 p.m. According to the host, it is a punishment if things are not done in the house when he returns. So since he has nowhere to go, he plays the fool and the naive one he does. 

The host is a type of authoritarian goliath, a deceitful dictator who likes to dominate the weak. Today I went to give this old man something to eat. I was attacked by this host who made me understand that if I came back to his place I would have to deal with him. Adrénaline,.fear, shaking everything was on me. I'm.resentful unfortunaltely.

I should point out that I live in France. I just honestly want to smash the kneecaps and the face of this bastard, I'm at my limit. I don't want to eliminate him but I'm not far from it. I know that in France we have a very lax system, like in the West. And that in all situations like this, you need proof of abuse of an elderly person and above all, you must not use violence except in cases of self-defense.

 The police are already aware of these abuses on this old man of 75 and they do nothing, because they are lax and lazy in this sector... In any case, I'm thinking, I want to beat this asshole with my fists and feet and at the same time I'm thinking about an alternative, I made 30 requests for accommodation for him and without return. So the violence... 

It drives you crazy. I can't remain insensitive. And of course I'm resentful!! This host threatened me tonight to no longer come to see my old friend or he will make me disappear. That host is walking with pressure, he is so agressive and loud mouth, that even if you are a solid man, you can't hold it. I remain lucid, I try to stay strong, but pride takes over, I just want to beat up this 56-year-old host.  (I'm 33 years old) . I just can. I practice Sambo and pencak silat. I can give him his damn lesson. Or little did i know he will give me a lesson too... I'm ready for it. 

I'm hot as embers, I feel that there is diesel on me and that the fire will soon start. Any advice, any opinions? I'm listening, thank you. Yeah, I have a vigilante complex.  I'm willing to go far for this...  What's holding me back is my conscience, guilt part... My belief in Jesus Christ remains. My belief prevents me from doing so. And of course I want to do it. Yes pure madness. I read Bible verses over and over again, it calms me down because I just want to hurt this host.

[Italy],"Hi, I am renting (via AirBnB) a tiny home for 3 months. The only source of natural light is through the front door, when it is open. There is a tiny window above the front door, but that is blocked by an air-conditioning unit and can only be used for very mild ventilation. 

My question is, due to this, would you consider it reasonable for me to sit just inside the front door with it open? While I am on my laptop and/or enjoying my morning coffee? 

The host made a passing comment about making sure I don’t leave the door open all the time, which of course I understand, if I was ever to leave the door, I would close it. 

What do you think? Is leaving the door open for natural light reasonable provided that I am sitting right just inside of it? 

I am asking in case the host comes back and insists that I keep the door shut at all times. I want to know some other opinions. 

Personally, I think it is within my reasonable use of the space I’m paying for, provided I am always attending the front door when it’s open.

BTW I am a very experienced Airbnb guest and this host and listing have 4.8 stars. The door had a window in the pictures, and was open and most of the pictures, but upon arriving, there is an opaque screen over the window.

Once he was in a rage and hit holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was “90% of this shit”. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he banged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was offing himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker threatened some stuff. . i was terrified. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc. 

im 23 and my parents are still happily marrried. 

Theyve had plenty boy of cry wolf situations  where they were getting a divorce but theyre both pathetic and never would. During these times, my mom acknowledged all this abuse.  Now, she acts like it never happened. Its great.  i love my mom more than anything, but she enabled him and she let him stick around. The fact they have the nerve to act like nothing happened really fuckin pisses me off. Im usually forgiving, but i want revenge for everything. his mother was abusive btw, havent heard from her in over a decade i think she was just as abusive in her own way.  i honestly hate him.  this is wrong of me isnt it… ?

When the clock hands chime at inopportune moments, 
And the lights begin to feel too warm against my scorched skin, 
And my hair crowds around my neck 
Like fingers round a coffee cup- 
I see the present like a voyeur looking at a game. 

Sometimes when the sounds get loud 
And the silence somehow drowns it out 
When the laughs get reduced to gaping mouths 
And social conventions to which I'm bound --
I see myself laughing from above the crowd like a forgotten memory. 

And it's always so peaceful, if a little eerie. 
My body seems to know better when it knows that it is empty. 
It takes on the part of the understudy with feigned grace and dug graves- 
And the wings are rather comfortable a place 
To call sanctuary. 

But every time 
I drift down from the church of distant recognition 
The memories all flood back in with military precision 
And the body relinquishes control with all-too-willing humility 
And the spotlight is too harsh on a converser of my ability- 
So the clock hands now jeer and leer and dole out pity
And the day moves on to joyful equity 
While I sit and reckon with the moments I beckoned 
And discarded like unwelcome guests. 

Still the hair crowds round my neck
Like coils in a spring or a rope or a ring 
And someone's been spilling the coffee on my skin 
And the fingers are shaking and so is the room 
And maybe the peace came a moment too soon
The wings are brimming with ingratitude- 

I lost myself but you lost me too.

1o443qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buyingforbaby/comments/1o443qr/pushchair_pram_confusion_recommendations_please/,pushchair / pram confusion - recommendations please,"Hi there, wondering if anyone has advice. We're first time parents in the UK looking to get a pram / travel system for baby due March. We're starting to look early as we're keeping our eyes on the 2nd hand marketplaces.     

**My priorities:**   

* Small when folded. The frame would largely be stored in a shared hallway as we live in a small flat in a converted house with one upstairs neighbour who is happy for us to store it there, so long as it is fairly compact. When baby is older and we're using it with the seat fitted, we might just fold it with the seat and leave it here too. I prefer when they're folded if they can stand on their own, so you don't have to lay them down or balance them.  
* I'm small and weak so I'd like it to be relatively light and easy to manage. 
* Ideally I'd like it to have a 'one handed fold' feature.
* I'd like it to have a sleep-safe bassinet / carrycot that we could take inside and use in our lounge for naps. 

**My partner's priorities:** 

* He'd like it to be all-terrain or otherwise appropriate for walks in the countryside.

**What we've looked at in person**  
We went to a buying for baby appointment and I really liked the bugaboo dragonfly and the joolz aer. I liked the 'Yoyo' in theory too but I didn't like how it was more involved to fold (2 handed job). 

However, when it was pointed out to us that these weren't all-terrain, my partner had a bit of an issue with this... he envisioned doing more walking in the countryside when we have a baby. I was worried that the bigger wheels and bulkier build would make it harder for me to manage on a daily basis: we live in a city and realistically the most use is going to be walks in the park where we live and going for coffee with friends. I wonder if it's really that big of a deal to not have an all-terrain feature - I was thinking he could just carry baby in a carrier if we want to go on a walk that's going to be rough underfoot. He liked the 'bugaboo fox renew' for this reason, and I also liked this as it still has the one-handed fold and does fold up fairly small, but you then have to sort of balance it on its side, and it's bigger, which I was less keen on. 

I'm also a little doubtful that these exact models will come up on the marketplaces as they're the newest versions, so I'm guessing we'd be looking at the fox 2/3 rather than the renew, which looks more complicated to fold (not one hand).

If anyone has any good recommendations, whether for the models I've listed here or completely different ones, I'd love to hear them! Would be great if we could find something with the features both of us think are important. ",3,1760210023.0,Buyingforbaby,0,1.0,False

So far my primary care, gi doc, and neuro can't figure it out either. It started with a very bad brain fog that would last for sometimes a few minutes to a few hours, usually just a day or so and I'd be fine for a couple of days before I'd experience it again. Followed by that I noticed I had pretty extreme bloating no matter what I ate, heavy carbohydrates and fiber meals would tend to be worse. Even my morning coffee with or without creamer would trigger this. For a few months I would get unexplained ""panic attacks"" (hr spikes, lightheaded, moderate to severe anxiety) with seemingly no trigger and I've never experienced this before. If Im having a bad episode I experience ataxia (I think? - uncoordinated, slightly slurred speech, trouble walking, difficulty understanding speech, confusion and anxiety) the worst of my symptoms by far was on a trip to Mexico, and one night out at dinner I had to struggle to use utensils, drink water, walking was difficult and uncoordinated, and I had mild tremors. I wasn't hungry at all that day and couldn't eat much of my dinner. I had to leave early because I wanted to be prepared to go to the hospital, and I was checking myself for signs of stroke because that's the only thing I could think might be happening. I was also extremely bloated during this time, as in my stomach was distended maybe +4-5"". A couple of days later, I had severe diarrhea for 2 days. The neuro episodes usually only last for at most an hour, typically 5-20 minutes, brain fog can last for a day or more.

History:
- 30M
- 5'9, 210lbs 
- hypertensive, not sure how bad it actually is because I get some ""white coat"" readings (first reading upwards of 170/75, but I've seen follow up readings sub 130/70, lowest recently was 120/67.
- no medications at this time
- no familial history of these symptoms

Symptoms:
- extreme bloating
- ataxia (or similar)
- panic attacks
- occasional acid reflux
- occasional pale stool (looks like bile issue)

Tests I have done:
- multiple cbc panels (all normal)
- metabolic panel (all normal)
- tsh (normal)
- sibo breath test (negative)
- full abdominal ultrasound (aorta, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, spleen - all normal except spleen **mild splenomegaly, 466cc**)
- standard neurological exam (normal)
- celiac test (negative)
- multiple ekgs (normal)
- CRP (normal)
- b12 (normal)
- Purchased dexcom cgm, normal glucose for a full month
- a1c (normal)

Tests ordered, need completed:
- h pylori
- stool sample
- 24hr urine sample (catecholamines)
- eeg
- mri w/o contrast

So far, my care team doesn't have a solid theory on what is happening, neuro said nothing is really jumping out to her yet so she wants to do an eeg to see about seizures and would like to see an MRI. I'm not sure if there's necessarily any correlation between the gi issues and the neurological ones, but the timing lining up and specifically the Mexico experience where both symptoms peaked into one horrifying night makes me think there's something there. Also, there was a period of about 2 months where all of these things just stopped, and I couldn't tell you what changed in my daily life to contribute to that. 

Any ideas? I understand we have scheduled further testing and something may come up on the eeg or mri, but I wanted to see if it looks like there's anything my care team is overlooking, or anything I should be asking them about. At this point I'm either expecting they find a brain tumor or tell me I'm just going insane and none of this is real lol",1,1760209949.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1o442fr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o442fr,Once again Marriott Titanium loyalty pays off 🙌☺️,"Just finished a fantastic 3-night stay at St. Regis Singapore and I can’t recommend this property enough! I had originally booked the base Astor room, but thanks to Titanium status and some great front desk hospitality, I was upgraded (on request + availability) to the Caroline Astor Suite — nearly 4 categories higher. 🌟

The suite was spotless, beautifully furnished, and the service was impeccable. A few highlights:

	•	Butler service: Available 24/7, super responsive, and they served complimentary tea & coffee every morning from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.

	•	Housekeeping: Prompt and efficient, everything always immaculate.

	•	Concierge team: A big shout-out — I was in town for exhibitions with a lot of sample bags, and they handled everything smoothly.

	•	Breakfast: Excellent spread with high-quality variety, definitely at par with St. Regis standards.

	•	Lounge: Great atmosphere with complimentary drinks (alcoholic & non-alcoholic) + tea/coffee from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

	•	Dining: Tried the Asian restaurant onsite and it was outstanding.

Location is another win — right on Orchard Road, with easy access to shopping, eateries, and transport. Honestly, if you’re visiting Singapore and want a luxury stay that blends accessibility with top-tier service, this is a property worth considering.

I’ll definitely keep St. Regis Singapore on my radar for future visits. 💯

Thank you so much for that!

It’s clear that many of us feel the same way.. Wanting to connect, but finding it hard to build friendships once you’re in your mid-20s. And with the holidays coming up, that feeling of being on your own can hit even harder.

So I thought  maybe start a small group chat or Discord for anyone in the area who wants to meet people and make plans together. Coffee runs, dinners, movie or game nights, weekend hangouts, walks, cooking together. Whatever helps us feel a little more connected and supported. Nothing forced, just a space to be ourselves and build real friendships.

It would be nice to have a group and people something that lasts beyond one-time events, where we can laugh, talk, and support each other.

If this sounds like something you’d like to be part of or are interested, feel free to DM me or drop a comment. Excited to see this little idea come to life and  make our days and the city feel a little brighter and cozier for all of us. 💛",7,1760209849.0,IowaCity,6,0.89,False

**Why This Pick?**



Minnesota started this season off hot with a shutout win (on the road, no less…) over the St. Louis Blues, 5-0. Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets kicked off their season with a loss on the road to the Nashville Predators. While I do think Columbus will have a decent year, the Wild looked completely dominant in their first game and should have little issue pulling off a victory at home sans OT. As far as recent history goes, Minnesota has won 8 of their last 10 encounters with the Blue Jackets. I’ll take the Wild to win in regulation for plus money here, friends.

1o4411c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o4411c/refill/,Refill,"Trent had a habit. Not the kind you kick with gum and patches—the kind that crept in smooth, like jazz on vinyl, like late-night texts that start with “you up?” and end with silence. He chased moments, not people. Sips of connection. A taste here, a tease there. Never full, never satisfied. Just enough to keep the thirst alive.

He met JoeAnne at a rooftop party in Bed-Stuy. She went by “Joe,” wore her daddy’s leather jacket and her mama’s pearls. Her voice? Velvet with a switchblade edge. She didn’t flirt—she sparred. And Trent, who’d always been the one to leave first, found himself lingering like steam on her coffee cup.

Joe didn’t play the game. She was the game. Her eyes scanned like barcodes, reading every lie before it left your lips. She danced like she was dodging bullets, kissed like she was signing a contract, and left before the ink dried.

Trent tried everything. Flowers. Playlists. That one poem he swore he’d never show anyone. She took it all with a smile and a shrug. “You sweet,” she said. “But I don’t do seconds.”

He called. She didn’t pick up. He showed up. She didn’t open the door. He wrote her a letter. She mailed it back with “Return to Sender” scrawled in red.

Now Trent walks the city like a man with a phantom limb. He orders coffee just to hear someone say “refill?” even though he knows she won’t be there. He’s not chasing women anymore—he’s chasing her. That first sip. That hit of something real.

But Joe? She’s gone. Like her daddy taught her: never let a man think he owns the recipe just because he liked the taste.

And Trent? He’s still thirsty.

1o440eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o440eb/i_just_got_off_my_shift_as_a_security_guard_and/,I just got off my shift as a security guard and took a bus home. Never thought it would be my last,"This happened around 3:30 in the morning on a Tuesday. My night shift as an airport security guard just ended and i was exhausted out of my mind, staying awake with the help of cheap energy drinks and poorly made coffee from the vending machine. I look at my phone and then it hits, my alarm that my shift has ended. I text my boss that i’m going home and i head to the locker room to grab my coat and backpack. This happened somewhere around the begging of winter so the cold swept the area pretty quick. 

As i was packing up i get this gut feeling something is wrong. Nothing in the moment was eye catching but something told me my ride home wouldn’t be as normal as the other ones. Recently my car broke down and has been at the mechanic for a week, this has forced me to take the bus to and from work. 

I walked out into the cold winter night feeling the gentle breeze on my cheeks, looking at my phone to see how long i have until the bus arrives at the station. From a distance i could see a large group of people waiting as well on the station for the bus. I didn’t think anything of the situation because i was far away and i couldn’t really see how many of them were there, but as i got closer things began to feel off. 

It wasn’t out of the ordinary for people to wait for the bus at this hour or in these groups because some flights reroute or get delayed so people can come this far into the night. The one thing i spotted that was weird was that they didn’t have any suitcases, they only carried bags that looked full of something. Like they packed some sort of liquid. I noticed this because some bags had a red substance leaking from the bags. 

Nevertheless i wasn’t gonna be the one to judge. As i was walking towards the station something grabbed me by my shoulder, it was my friend Nancy who just finished her job as a cleaning lady at the airport. We became friends after we were both placed on night shifts and as nothing was going on we would occasionally grab a coffee and chat together until work called. We got to talking and she also mentioned the people standing at the station. She then decided to describe their appearance to me as if i wasn’t already creeped out by their presence.

“You see that guy with the brown coat and sunglasses” said Nancy

“Yea why” i said

“Who wears sunglasses at almost 4 am in the morning” 

“Idk but i don’t think its only him, i see at least 4 more that also wear a pair” 

As we got to talking there it was, the bus was in the corner of my eye and as soon as i saw it in the distance, the people on the station all turned their head in perfect synchronisation. I didn’t even tell Nancy about it because she was focused on hurrying me on the bus.

As the bus rolled to the station the driver looked at me in the eyes and looked visibly concerned, i didn’t ,again, think anything too much of it because i was extremely exhausted from work and just wanted to get home quickly. Then the door to the bus opened.

As per law every citizen must enter the bus from the front or the driver can give you a ticket for disorderly conduct, so everyone went to the front including me and Nancy. As we walked to the front the people formed a line to enter the bus. “Weird” i thought, “most people just rush to get in” i mumbled to myself. As i got in the bus i was in the back and Nancy was behind me waiting for the line.

As we entered we heard the driver speak in a language neither me nor Nancy could understand. It sounded like a mix of slavic and nordic languages. My father was a war refugee from the Yugoslav wars and i knew Croatian because he refused to talk english when he escaped to the us, still to this day i don’t know how he communicated with people or how he met my mother but he did. When it was our turn to buy tickets for the bus the driver started to talk to us in this weird language. Since he saw we didn’t understand a single word he said he handed us a paper and urged us to go to the back of the bus. As we walked past the people they stared blankly into us.

Nancy was pushing against me from all the fear and confusion, clenching onto my arm like it was a weapon she could use. We sat at the back and looked at everyone with such sheer confusion thinking we were in alternate universe and we were the only real people in this bus. Little did we know we were in fact right about that. The bus started, the doors closed and off we went. Nancy told me to check the paper the driver gave me, from only the first few words my blood froze. This is what was written on the letter


“If you are reading this don’t be frightened, i know what it looks like and every thought you had running through your head about these people was right. 

There are some things you have to do to stay alive in this situation and i’m going to help you. Now, all of the things i say here must be followed exactly the way i say it must be. I hope you got it, now read this carefully and with full understanding 

From 4 am to 4:30 am be at the back of the bus and wait for me to turn on the stop bus sign on the top of the third exit nearest to the end of the bus. It will appear on top of the door with a bright red glow. Before that do not speak, look at other people or look at your phone because that will attract attention from the “people” with sunglasses. After they leave you will be able to freely talk, look at them and turn on your phone. 


From 4:30 to 5 am the people with sunglasses will leave the bus and after that every “person” in the bus will rise from their seat and look at their closest window. Do the same for 5 minutes minimum. You can do it at any point in that time period but the others will be facing the windows the whole time. Before 5 am come to the front of the bus because if you don’t a fate worse than death will occur to you. 



After 5 am only two seats that will be available in the front will be behind my cabin and another one right across it. Until 6 am and before you get off you will hear screams. When you hear them they will occur at 5 am sharp and last until 5:30. During this time period do not look back under any circumstances. Not to peek, not to scratch yourself, not to sneeze, not even to look at whats holding your shoulders. A creature will grab you by the shoulders and hold it tightly until it lets go. The hands will be moist, bright red and have gentle warmth that will progress into freezing cold. You might get frostbite but it’s for the better you don’t touch the hand.


After 6 am get out of the bus. You will be home but my fate is still to be decided. I depend on some rules as well as you. May god be with you and with me and may he guide us through this hell together”

4 am hit instantly and every single person was completely silent. Not a phone in sight. No-one was talking or even looking in the direction of each other. Every person there was looking in their own direction. Like they didn’t want to make eye contact with one another. We did as the letter said, laid low just looked around and hoped we would get through this hell together.

Somewhere around 4:13 i heard loud breathing above me. I laid my head to rest on the back of the seat and as i rose my head i saw a woman with giant eyes and a grin resembling the one of the devil look at me drooling from her mouth. I froze thinking this is my end until Nancy looked at her as well and screamed in horror. The thing shifted her focus from me and turned to Nancy at superhuman speed. The thing grabbed her by her hair, pulled her away from her seat and dragged her to the middle row of the bus, and exited through the door with Nancy. I never saw her again after that but i knew my survival was still on the line. I had to make it out alive and i knew the only way to do it is to follow these rules. 


The rest of those 15 minutes felt like they lasted an hour. I lost track of time and every thought i tried to think of quickly switched to fear and thinking it was my last bus ride home. Then at some point i heard the bus stop. The people with sunglasses left the bus and everyone else rose from their seats and looked outside their respective windows. I did the same just to get those 5 minutes out of the way so i don’t have to worry about it later on. As i looked out i felt someone tap my scalp gently with something sharp, it felt like really pointy fingers but i wasn’t going to turn around from the fear of my safety. The nail burrowed into my head and continued to pierce my skin. I just looked outside not having the balls to look behind me. At some point it stopped and took its finger out of my head. I had laid my head to look a bit down so i don’t have to look at the creatures that were in the same bus as me, thats why i wasn’t able to figure out what the item was.

Nevertheless i continued with the bus ride. Fearing whats next i looked at my phone. It was 4:40. I rushed to the front of the bus knowing what the next step is, hurriedly without a single thought in my mind, sat in the first row and just started thinking about Nancy. That poor woman, god knows what happened to her and where she went. After a long thought process i looked back, every creature in the bus started to bang their head against the window. Scared to death i turned to the driver and exchanged eye contact. In his eyes i knew he didn’t know what was happening either so we just stared blankly at the road ahead, both doing what needed to be dome to get home safely.

4:50 hits, I’m waiting for the moment in which the screams begin then i hear faint whispering in the back of my ear. From the whisper i couldn’t make out who was making it or where it was coming from, then from whispering to whistling and finally singing. I knew that voice, it was Nancy. I was about to turn my head when the driver hit the brakes, looked at me and showed me his watch. It was 5:00. I almost died not paying attention to the time. 

I stared at the front of the bus, fearing for whats next. Whispers grew louder, singing became more evident and whistles were coming closer and closer, until a hand grabbed my shoulder. As the paper read the touch was warm, almost like someone was holding a glass of cocoa before placing their hand on me. Then the temperature shifted, progressively getting colder and colder by the second. It wasn’t noticeable at first but as the hands held onto me longer the more i could notice just how much cold was progressing onto my body at this time. The driver looked at me worriedly thinking i wasn’t going to make it without moving. The touch was so cold my shoulder started to hurt unimaginably. Thinking this is the end the hand pulled away, i thought i was safe. I breathed a sigh of relief but something was wrong. My phone buzzed and i saw the time. It was 5:25. “Didn’t the note say screams were supposed to be heard until 5:30”. Maybe the note was wrong or outdated, but then screams began echoing through the bus

The screams sounded like souls of the damned in the deepest parts of hell, pulling their flesh bit by bit until there was nothing left. I had endured everything on this bus but the screams were the only thing i wasnt able to shut out. Driver looked worried but looked unfazed like he went through this multiple times and kept driving. I put my hands on my ears but to no avail, the screams couldnt be silenced, not by my hands or by any hands. Then the screams suddenly stopped, thinking i was safe i looked at the driver with relief but he looked at me with horror, his eyes began watering, his forehead was sweating and his breathing became more and more rapid. His gaze shifted upward looking at me like he saw the devil himself. Then in a few simple words he made my blood run colder than the ice in the freezer. 


“Dont, move”. 

I froze, more still than a human statue. He gently moved his head to look at the road, leaving me with fear of what was above me. I didnt dare to look or look anywhere in fact. I shut my eyes for the remainder of the ride until 6:00 hit. 

The bus driver told me to get out of the bus immediately. I rushed hearing running behind me as i ran out the opened door of the bus. I jumped out of the bus but there was no ground, the earth just disappeared and i went on a free fall until i plummeted to the floor

I woke up in my office at the airport and as soon as i did i jumped out of my chair looking around feeling the floor below my feet, sweat dripping down my head. Hyperventilating i sat back at my chair, looked at the clock on my wall and the time read 4:15. Then i heard a knock on my office window and i jumped out of my seat not knowing what to expect, but it was Nancy. Unharmed and worried, she kept knocking on my window until i got out of my office and hugged her excited to see her again. She was confused at first then after i explained her my dream she realised why my reaction was so subtle.

After that dream my consciousness told me i should go by taxi to and from work and never dared to enter another bus again. ",2,1760209797.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

While my family member receives monthly treatment, which can last several hours, I would wait nearby at this Starbucks. It became my little escape, a place where I could breathe and recover from the constant worry and fatigue that come with caregiving. The lead barista always greeted me by name and made sure I had a calm corner to sit in, even when the store was busy. She had a warm personality and a quick sense of humor that made the hardest days feel a little lighter.

When the store was not busy, she and I would brainstorm creative drink customizations that could be entered into the system so I could reorder them through the app at another location if needed. Her team shared that same care. During slower moments, they would carefully check the order of layers on complicated drinks, making sure everything was done properly. Those small acts of thoughtfulness made the place feel genuine and personal, far beyond anything corporate policies or gimmicks could produce.

This Starbucks had a calm, mature atmosphere that made long waiting hours at the hospital bearable. The other Starbucks nearby is often noisy and crowded, which might be fine for some, but not for someone looking for a quiet corner to regain a little peace in the middle of difficult days.

Earlier this week, I opened the Starbucks app to place my usual mobile order, and the green dot for my store was gone. My heart sank. I had read CEO Brian Niccol’s statements about closing stores that did not align with his vision, but I never imagined that this one would disappear.

When I arrived and saw the doors boarded up, it hit me hard. That store was not just a place to get coffee. It was part of how I stayed grounded while my family continues to fight cancer. The baristas at this location are what made the experience real. Their warmth, care, and attention could never be replicated by corporate policies.

Brian Niccol can speak endlessly about brand vision and efficiency, but from where I stand, those words miss the mark. His decisions have real consequences for people who rely on Starbucks not just for coffee, but as a “third-place,” a refuge to pause, gather strength, and momentarily escape the weight of their lives. He did not just close an amazing store. That location was a place that helped someone endure one of the most difficult periods of their life.

Meanwhile, Niccol enjoys extraordinary income, corporate perks, and a lifestyle far removed from the daily struggles of employees and customers alike. This stark gap shows how disconnected he is from the people and experiences that make Starbucks meaningful. By prioritizing efficiency, rigid policies, and corporate gimmicks over genuine care, he is eroding what made Starbucks special. Starbucks is a Siren, but under his leadership, that Siren is losing its call. The very connection that once drew in passionate baristas and customers seeking a sanctuary is being steadily destroyed.",26,1760209786.0,starbucks,1,0.84,False

It’s mostly brown but they don’t have any weeds. The rest of my front yard is always green but does have weeds. Before it was dandelions now it’s some kind of mini bush type of weed 3 inches tall and lots of crabgrass and clover. I’ve not used any chemicals so far. But plan to use preen next spring. I spent cash on expensive seed and threw about 3 bags of leaf compost and 3 bags of black and when I ran out of that I had Milorganite so I put that on the rest of the front yard. 

Now coming to this bare patch can I just dump coffee grounds over the months and see if the soil improves? Has anyone tried similar stuff. 
It’s hard and solid clay and it’s dry. Feels kind a dumb to buy soil with $$ to dump there and I’m out of $$. I got 10lbs of coffee grounds yesterday free from a nearby Starbucks. Looking for cost effective ideas. Or I should probably start burying kitchen scraps one sqft at time

My husband bought me a coffee mug that came in the mail over a week ago.


He's currently at work, and i'm just home on the couch feeling like crap as usual. He doesn't get home until 8pm, and has absolutely nothing planned. I've had terrible and I mean TERRIBLE gerd since 20 weeks of pregnancy. I haven't slept without regurgitating food into my throat overnight causing coughing / choking fits in months. The only way to reduce the chances of this happening is for me to eat an earlier dinner. I had gotten in the habit of eating dinner around 8:30 at night to fit with his schedule, and it just doesn't work with the gerd and going to bed around 11. He knows this. He has to sleep next to me every night as i get up multiple times to vomit. 


When I brought up feeling disappointed in his lack of effort for today, his panic excuse was he was planning on taking me for food after work... I literally can't eat that late, and the last thing I want to do is go to a restaurant in my state. It just doesn't make sense to me how he can be so thoughtless. I told him he could have bought me flowers and had them delivered or something.. or cooked.. or hell, even order me my favorite meal and have it delivered here. He can also EASILY leave work early or call out completely. He has hundreds of hours of ppto he hoards and uses whenever he wants.


Money isn't an issue. It's the lack of respect for the woman carrying his child that's really getting to me. He never does anything romantic so I truly wasn't expecting much.. but damn. Absolutely not a thought in his head. I waited this long to have a child with him because my ex treated me so horribly I never wanted to go through what I did again. We tried for this baby for 8 months before I finally got pregnant. He wanted this so bad, and even worked his way up in his career so I can be a SAHM and care for our child without too much financial stress. All that just to neglect me once I need him the most.


He's not a bad guy.. just a freaking idiot. He's a huge gamer, mostly his precious World of Warcraft or League. I'd be full of it if I said I didn't know this before getting pregnant, but it wasn't a problem because he always made sure we came first. He never did anything special for me, but it was always good enough for me to at least be neutral about. We had an argument just 2 days ago because I was having a terrible day thanks to something he said and ended up getting contractions for hours. 9pm on the dot, he gets up to kiss me to go do his scheduled twice weekly raid in Warcraft while i'm clearly in pain. I wasn't having it and cried all night while he sat there silently offering absolutely nothing.


In conclusion, this man is currently on my last nerve. I feel like any communication I try with him ends with him just acting like he's not doing anything wrong. But whatever.. I chose this.",2,1760209766.0,pregnant,2,0.67,False

1o43ycg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1o43ycg/i_have_finally_unlocked_how_to_make_british_tea/,I have finally unlocked how to make British Tea in America!,"After moving to the US from the UK I was heartbroken that any time I tried to make English Tea here it just tasted like sugar water. Every combination of different tea bags, sugar, water and milk resulted in a frustrating realization that I will not be able to recreate the taste again. I turned to Coffee as my go-to morning beverage.

But no more!

The issue really is the water. American water is either tap water plagued by Fluoride (Edit: I'm just being funny here. I don't know what it is, I'm not a water expert. Just know US and UK water is DIFFERENT) or bottled water which is 'purified' tap water. But there is a natural spring water available called ""Crystal Geyser Alpine Spring Water"" and it's less than $1.50 for a gallon! This contains the minerals needed to absorb that delicious tea flavor.

For fellow brits in America, you know how you like your tea. Substitute your water for this brand and enjoy.

For Americans, here is 'MY' step-by-step breakdown:  
EDIT: (To clarify for people in the comments, this is MY way of making tea, which also my family, friends and some acquaintances prefer. If you see my above 'For fellow brits' comment above I did not give instructions because everyone has their own way of doing it. If you don't like my way, find your own)

1. Boil the Crystal Geyser Alpine Spring Water, preferably in a tea kettle (Please DON'T nuke it in a microwave, you want it at BOILING point)
2. Add PURE CANE SUGAR (Traditionally 2 tea spoons (NOT TABLE SPOON) but this will be very sweet so maybe start with 1 to begin with) to a SMALL tea cup (Mugs will reduce the flavor and will require you to use 2 tea bags and double the sugar/milk) and just a splash of WHOLE MILK
3. (Note: Use the English Breakfast Tea blend. I prefer Yorkshire tea bags but you can use Tetley or Twining's English Breakfast. Each blend will have slightly varied tastes)
4. Pour the boiled water into the cup and let it soak for at least 30 seconds.
5. Strain the teabag with the teaspoon by pressing firmly on the teabag against the side of the cup. You will notice a darker color starting to fill the cup. Do this a few times until the liquid is a deep golden color (If you put in too much milk the color will be much lighter).

1o43wr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1o43wr9/last_note_i_sent_you_every_day_is_hard_and_every/,Last note I sent you... every day is hard and every day I wonder if I should call you,"Hey. 
Hello. I'm not sure why I'm writing you or what I wanted to say. I feel confused, and I feel sad and I feel tired. 
Some days ago when I told you that I miss you and that is difficult for me to process how you don't miss me, you answered ""its fine, one day that will disappear"", and with that something broke inside me. 

I've never being around someone who so simply could be ready and maybe even eager for my feelings to go away. I am and always have been those feelings you wished eventually (hopefully soon) will disappear.

You are seeing someone now. Someone new who had treated you like she couldn't care less but anyhow there you are pursuing her. 
And I didn't even asked you today. I literally said ""I wont ask for that because I wont put you on a position of pressuring you"" 
But you had to answer ""if I dont meet with her we could possibly meet for coffee"".
Even not asking for it you had to let me know how I came second. 
I didn't notice until I noticed it. No matter all I have done, all I have said, all I have felt, I am not enough and I'm not important or valued by you. You have seen this woman 5 times and you known me as an -at least- ""close friend"" and/or ex, who you havent seen in five months but you would place me second on your priorities of the day. Thats as good as it gets for friendship. Thats the respect our friendship gets. My friendship. I get. 

And I noticed it then. I finally get it. This is what I feel:
I give up. I give up the consideration, the place and the love. I surrender because I will always feel like its not enough. Im not enough.
I think I'm so special and I think what I have to offer is so precious but you make me feel Im all the opposite. And I just wanted to not to lose you, all I wanted was to not to throw this friendship down the hole, all I wanted was you to want me. And now I give up. 
I don't expect nothing from you now and that's all you ever wanted. Im done. My love is done and my beaten ego/pride is done. 

In the bottom of my heart I dont think you ever loved me...I actually dont think you ever appreciated me and appreciated what I gave to you. All I feel is I'm entertainment when you are bored or I am joy when you are sad. I'm not your family and I'm not a friend of yours. I have developed this love for you, for your family and your life which is beyond my understanding and it does make me so sad to lose. I do believe you might love more a fancy car that you want a picture with, than me. You might love more the waves of the sea than me. You might have always loved more any dog even a completely unknown one but me. And I give up. That realization wins.

Now
Well now im grant. You will continue to exist and I wish anything you wanted you get. I will exist behind my walls. Ill sit away with my cute bangs, my songs and my compassion for you. I'm really sorry I loved you and Im already more sorry that I'll miss you so very much. Ill miss us so much, specially in the mornings, specially in the car, specially around 1 or 3 or 6pm. 

Thank you for reading me.

Thought I’d share in case it helps someone else struggling with consistency.  
**Habit Building & Routine:**

1. **Habit Pairing/Stacking:** Add a new desired habit immediately before or after an existing, ingrained habit (e.g., drink water after plugging in phone, do push-ups after snacking).
2. **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
3. **Prepare The Night Before:** Lay out clothes, pack lunches/bags, set up the coffee maker, etc., the evening prior to reduce morning friction.
4. **Automate Routines:** Use smart home devices (lights, speakers) or phone routines (Google/Siri) to trigger sequences (e.g., wake up alarm + lights on + music/news playing).
5. **Start Routines Immediately:** Engage in key morning tasks (shower, brush teeth, get dressed) right after waking up to build momentum.
6. **Leverage External Accountability:** Use tools or situations where your inaction impacts others (shared calendars, coaches, friends expecting updates, inviting people over to force cleaning). Ask friends for ""kicks.""
7. **Gamify Tasks:** Turn chores or habit building into a game (timing tasks with a stopwatch, using apps like Finch, setting challenges, pretending to be a character, counting items cleaned).
8. **Use Novelty:** Introduce novelty into routines (multiple toothpaste flavors, cute sponges, new playlists) to maintain interest.
9. **Reward System (Sometimes Before):** Use rewards, occasionally giving the reward before the task to help initiate it (e.g., eat chocolate, then work).
10. **Consistent Placement:** Always put essential items (keys, wallet, phone) in the exact same place or pocket every time.
11. **Reduce Friction:** Identify and remove barriers or extra steps for tasks (e.g., keep cleaning supplies where needed, use pre-portioned snacks, don't fold clothes that don't need it).

None of these are life-changing on their own, but together they make routines finally *doable* instead of forced.

*please note: its 1:30 am,  I can't sleep, and my mind has been going in circles for hours*

I had a weird thing happen earlier this evening. I was out for dinner with my extended family: Me, my son, my Dad, Stepmum, brother, brothers fiance, brother's son. 
The venue is one of those boutique microbrewery places that also serves food. Typical Australian thing. 

A little while after we arrive and have settled at the table my Stepmum leans in and says that a guy at the next table is looking at me. I glance over and he does seem to be deliberately looking at me. 
My first thought thought is to ask myself whether this dude is thinking about wanting to f*ck me or fight me. 
I then pretty much forget about him when my son starts demanding attention. 

I'm finding this whole thing disproportionatly weird. 
I'm 42 transfemme, mostly lesb, and married to a ciswoman. Wife and I met prior to transition. 
 I've never felt particularly physically attractive, and can't remember ever drawing attention that way from anyone really. 
My existence is basically characterised as being 'background character #3' 

2 weeks ago I hit rock bottom in my life. I had a dissociative episode where after a month of spiralling I became overwhelmed. One minute I was drinking coffee and helping son get ready for school. Next minute someone else was driving my body, and they were in a blind rage. I barely remember any of it. 
I tried to hang myself. The backyard camera caught the attempt and that is not something I ever want to watch again.

After this I apparently just walked out of the house and vanished for 2 hours. I do not know where I went or what I did. I turned up several kilometres away to the local veterans support place, in a daze just rambling on about nonsense and needing help. I had sticks and stuff in my hair and a huge bruise on my foot. 
After calming me down they got in contact with my wife, who had called an ambulance because I had hurt her. The police then turned up and arrested me. 
I was taken to the hospital where I started having PTSD flashback because a beeper or something in the ER sounds like the emergency alarm on a FFG. 
Eventually the mental health nurse sees me, relays what I say to the psychiatrist. 

So, dissociation, suicide attempt, ptsd flashbacks.
Psych decide the best thing for me is to leave hospital and go to the Police lock up. 

I'm charged with assault on my wife. 
I'm strip searched, made to surrender my bra, barefoot, and put in a cell next to a meth head who's noisily coming down. It's cold,  and noisy.

Next morning, having had no sleep I'm taken to the courthouse to be put in another cell. We're told nothing except to wait to see the duty lawyer before we face the magistrate. I see the duty lawyer at about 3pm. The magistrate maybe an hour later. I'm still barefoot, braless, haven't slept and still in yesterday's clothes. I'm put on bail, not allowed to go to my home or contact my wife for help. 

I'm released from lockup at 450pm. It's Friday, and a long weekend is about to start. I'm lucky in that at some point my wife gave the police my handbag, phone, and car keys. Otherwise I'd have had literally a tshirt, bra, bike shorts, and knickers. 

I call a friend who's able to take my keys to collect my car from home, along with some clothes and other supplies.

I try to get a room for the night, long weekend, all booked up. 
I call my dad and beg him to take me in. After the obligatory lecture from him, I'm able to go there. It's an hour drive, along the way I contemplate several times ramming a bridge pylon at speed. 
Rock meet bottom.

The veterans support place have been helping me. They've facilitated a stay in a mental health hospital, I'm going there Monday. 

Its now 2:22 am.
This madness is just going round and round in my head. I can't make it stop. 

I'm wrestling with the urge to delete this post. Thats been my default to everything since I was 11. Lock the feelings away, keep everyone out. 

I just feel so very lost right now.

Lost and ashamed of myself. It hurts in my chest. 

Somehow I need to balance going to hospital with all the legal stuff and going to court in 2 weeks. Little stuff is stressing me out, is there parking at the hospital? If no, where does my car go? If no car how do I travel to the lawyers appointment, which I can't change because its too short notice. Literally have been phoned on a saturday afternoon about a hospital admission on Monday. 

I only have my son until the afternoon, and I'm losing half the day because my brother bullied me into helping him run an errand. Then his fiance (who's like yean years younger than me) lectured me making sure I look after myself and talking to people when I'm struggling. 
Bitch, please, like I didn't already know that. The real problem is the glass wall between me and everyone else. 

I'm very neurodivergent. And I'm the only adult one in my family. My son is diagnosed ADHD and suspected autistic. There is a glass wall between me and everyone who I love. And apparently the wall makes me 'difficult' 
I don't want to be difficult,  but there's intrusive thoughts and paranoia. 

Everywhere I go I just don't fit in. I've tried a veterans group, but I'm much younger than most of them, and they're usually men. 
I tried a craft group, sewing and crochet etc. Those women are also older than me, and the neurospicy makes it hard for me to do small talk. 

I joined Jiu-jitsu a few months back, and was quietly optimistic. I met some women who are my age, they find me pleasant. 
Then one evening we had a relief instructor come in. I recognise him. *He Was At My Wedding*. He only knows me as [deadname]. Instant panic attack. I blurted out some stuff to a new friend, who realises that I've just accidentally outed myself to her. I then realise what I've done and the chest pain starts. 

I'm lucky that this person is supportive of me, pretty much anyone else there that night I would not trust to be open with. 

My chest has been aching for 6 weeks now, and I do not know how I have any adrenaline left, its been pumping for so long now.

It's 3 am. I've been typing for 90 minutes. I'm so tired that I'm just gunna roll the dice with this post. Please be gentle with me.

Technically not an Ultra but with 7,800 ft of gain and the time on feet, it sure felt like one or at least what I could Imagine a 50k may feel like. I used Pikes peak as a mid block test for my 50 miler coming up in November, and didn't see many race reports so figured I'd share my thoughts.

**Race**: Pikes Peak Marathon, Manitou Springs

**Total Time**: 4:34 l 10:26/mile average

**Ascent Time**: 2:53 | 12:59/mile average

**Descent Time**: 1:41 l 7:49/mile average

**Placement:** 9th Overall

[Strava Activity link](https://www.strava.com/activities/15891920600)

**Training**:

After some hip flexor issues right after crossing the finish line of the Eugene Marathon back in April, I took two months off and just cross trained but had a decent base coming into the start of training the very end of June.

The start of block was July and my plan going in was to just get used to running more vert and get more on time on feet during the week. Typical week was 5-6k of vert with an average of around 50 miles per week with the peak week being 72 miles with 11k of vert. 

Most weeks had one session of faster hill repeats and then back to back longer runs on Saturday and Sunday. Last peak week was back to back 20 milers. Having just transitioned from road running to trail running, it definitely took me until mid block to feel even remotely comfortable with my climbing. I live in Colorado Springs but in order to simulate running above tree line I also did a lot of work on 14ers. Ran 3, 14ers (Yale, Quandry, and Huron) and hiked Elbert and Bierstadt and then did some work at the top of pikes peak to get a feel for the course and spending large periods of time up high.

**Gear**:

* La Sportiva Prodigio Pro's

Aimed for about 100g of Carbs/hour with about 30-40 being from drink mix and about a liter an hour of water but by mile 19 by stomach started to turn and I was almost starting throwing up gels, so last hour was a little lighter on the fueling. 

**Race day**:

Woke up at 4:15am and ate a big bowl of oatmeal and had coffee. Race started at 7am in downtown Manitou Springs, were I was placed in wave number one. Each wave was spaced out by about 2 minutes. 

Weather on race day was nearly perfect at the start at around 55-60 degree's but it did get a little hot at the end on the way down.

The start of the course is about a mile road segment with about 200ft of gain to get to the start of the trail. In that mile I decided to stick right behind the lead pack and attempt to settle in before the climb began. About a mile into the climb I looked at my watch and noticed a 182 HR and got a little worried that I started off a little quick, but as I began to mix in a little power hiking I started to regain control. 

I tried to find another person to run behind where I could turn my brain off and copy their run/power hike strategy but found myself alone for a majority of miles 3-7. Once you hit mile 6ish, the course begins to flatten out, and so I pushed those miles but not long after Barr camp (mile 7.5ish), it begins to get really challenging with elevation and grade. From there I was in a optimistic survival mode, until hitting tree line, where you have about 3 miles to go before the Summit. 

As I got higher up the mountain, I began to pass people and reached the top right behind 6th place. At this point my legs were absolutely shot but I knew It was almost time for the downhill. Once I reached the top and started the descent though, I realized I was a little mentally shot. The hardest part of this course in my opinion is the mental focus it takes to run downhill on technical terrain while avoiding the runners coming up. 

By mile 17ish I was in survival mode after a fall and was trying really hard to stay positive. Luckily after consuming a caffeinated gel, I started to get a little more life in my legs but still was in a world of hurt. 

For the rest of the race, I just tried not to slow down and made it to the finish line in 9th place with only getting passed by a couple of runners. 

**Lessons learned**:

* How hard the downhill is on this course. I figured I'd make it to the top in around 20th place and then rip the downhill to make up position. boy was I wrong. Training extended downtown on technical terrain is essential. The longest decent I done in training was only around 8 miles.
* The importance of having watch nutrition reminders turned on. It's really hard to think clearly above tree line and I had a hard time remembering to eat and pretty sure I over corrected and doubled up on gels once which killed my stomach.
* The importance of practicing power hiking during training. I did a lot of this during training and pretty sure this was the only reason I was able to pass a handful of people above tree line. 
* Not racing in a ""faster"" shoe that you don't have lots of practice on with technical downhill. I got my Prodigio pro's about a week before race day and It shook my confidence level on the descent.

On paper he was my type and in person he was my type. To backtrack he asked me right away f i wanted to meet for coffee sometime as he doesnt like to message for too long. I agree and we plan to meet the following week on a sunday. He consistently messages me daily during the week but just one to two exchanges each from us both. So we arrange the time and place the day before.

The date goes very well - I am instantly attracted to him and we get on well ie laughing a lot, prolonged eye contact from him and i just feel comfortable around him. He just fits my type really well. He does appear to be into me as well but maybe he just enjoyed the date and not necessarily me.

At the end of the date he says he will message me later. Which he does and he says ""Hope you got home safe :D was lovely to meet"". I respond back warmly and quite enthusiastic but not overly eager and just mention that I really enjoyed meeting him. He responded with ""We must organise another one some time;)"". I respond the next day at lunchtime monday this week (this was the rhythm of messaging the week leading up to the date so not a contrast in messaging from me) with ""Sounds like a plan:) hows your day going?""

So this is where he doesnt respond to my message until thursday night of this week at 8pm with ""Hiya sorry been a busy few days :D, my week has been good, hows your week been?"". So over 3 days of no contact from him. And no mention of meeting up either. So its saturday night and I have still to respond to him as I was honestly thinking he was a lost cause and that he only has mild interest in me (so no date this weekend because I had mentally written him off and was actually surprised to see a message from him on thursday night). I want someone to be genuinely into me and to see something longterm. So i am going to respond to him on monday as I honestly just feel hes making excuses about being busy and that he isnt going to ask to meet up again.

I also want to add Im not trying to play games. If anything hes the one playing games. I just want to protect my peace and energy and not have someone waste my time like before. On the flip side I am going to give him one last chance i think. Or is he a lost cause? I would really appreciate anyones thoughts on this scenario? Thank you

Located in the SpinCycle laundromat on 35th and Guadalupe, BRB Coffee is a recently opened coffee shop with all the classics and some fun middle eastern flair too. 

It’s owned by two Syrian brothers who are exceedingly hospitable and nice. Talking to them is one of the best parts of going. 

All their coffee and tea is excellent-they have all the regular stuff as well as cardamom pistachio, black sesame tahini, and more lattes I can’t remember now. 

I’m not a coffee person so I get the pomegranate rose tonic. It’s awesome. 

Their mom makes the baklava, there’s pistachio and walnut peanut. 

Another bakery makes their sambosas, savory and sweet afghan pastries that are sooooooo good. 

There’s a Korean ramen station with a shit ton of options. 

The seating is actually comfortable and a great place to do the crossword (and your laundry). 

They have shows of varying genres every now and again. 

My friend went and they gave her a prop from their plants. 👀

He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he banged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was offing himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway.

1. **Pick a time + place.** “After coffee at 9:00, at my desk, I start focus time.”
2. **One job only.** Write it on a sticky note: “Finish slide 1,” “Email Sam,” “Read 3 pages.”
3. **Start tiny.** Set a timer for **10 minutes**. Just begin. Two minutes is okay on day one.
4. **Hide the noise.** Phone in another room. Full-screen one app. Close other tabs.
5. **Use a quick start.** Open the file and type **one ugly sentence**. Motion beats motivation.
6. **End with a win.** Timer ends → check a box, stretch, sip water. Tell your brain, “Good job.”

1o43k4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1o43k4l/my_f26_girlfriend_f26_gets_drastically_upset_at/,My (F26) girlfriend (F26) gets drastically upset at herself when we argue. I can't tell if I'm the issue or not.,"I love my girlfriend a lot, we've been together for over 5 years, living together for 3, and our relationship is amazing. We've both been through a lot of personal hardships and been crucial support for each other, and truthfully I rely on her quite a bit and have for the past year. I currently work two part-time jobs, and have had around 30 interviews with no success for my career. Because of this, I'm constantly poor and unable to pay an equal amount on our bills. I try to contribute fairly based on my income, but it's substantially less than my girlfriend, who's career has been amazingly successful and is making not a ton of money, but much more than most people our age in our area.

I say all of this to provide some context on where our relationship is at and what might be factoring into any power dynamics. I try my best to avoid being co-dependent, but the reality is that if I wasn't with her I probably would've been homeless earlier this year. This month, I have had two job opportunities come up that look like they'll finally end my financial dependency, and we're also moving apartments to somewhere less noisy and more like our ideal living situation.

For the past month, it seems like any issue or hurt feelings one of us has will quickly spiral into something drastic. We've always had emotional arguments in the sense that we both really love each other and want each other to be happy, so it isn't uncommon for an argument to go on for 40 minutes until we completely understand one another and both feel totally on the same page. I find this to be incredibly healthy and relieving that we really truly make an effort to ensure we're both fully understood, there's never any shouting, we give each other space to gather our thoughts and go in with a mindset of understanding rather than proving ourselves to be right, but I also realize how much vulnerability that kind of effort entails. I would say these kinds of arguments only happen once a month or so.

Lately, my girlfriend has voiced how it seems like we can't go one weekend without an argument that completely derails what's supposed to be the break in the week. She usually frames this as ""I (my girlfriend) am always f*cking something up to ruin our whole weekend,"" and gets pretty inconsolable. I have been in an abusive relationship in the past and worry pretty often about possibly slipping into bad habits I learned from it, so anytime I share with her that something she did hurt my feelings I really try to make sure I don't make too big a deal out of it, and that I'm not blaming her or calling her a bad partner. I think she is overly empathetic to me, and takes all responsibility for any issues that crop up, and views herself as this terrible person that's always pissing me off and me as this object of pity that she needs to protect. I feel like it's not unusual for someone you live with to do something that upsets you once a week, but it is unusual to make a big deal about it and for it to lead to tears and big emotions every single time (for both of us, not just her).

This has put me in a tough spot, because I really don't want to be making a big deal out of small things! I love her and the amount of joy and happiness she brings to my life will always deeply, deeply outweigh anything negative she could ever accidentally do. But I like being able to be honest about when she hurts my feelings, and my concern is that if we continue down this path I'll stop being honest and she'll do the same for fear of 'ruining things' and we'll just grow to resent each other and the arguments will be fewer and further between but much bigger and more bitter.

This leads us to this morning, where we excitedly went out for a hike and picnic. We managed to get all of our chores finished on Friday, leaving a full weekend with zero obligations for the first time in months. I ended up taking around 30 minutes longer than expected to be ready to leave, and as we were about to head out the door my girlfriend poked fun at me by commenting on how the coffee I made myself was lukewarm, pointed out a pill I left on the counter next to the coffee by saying ""did you forget this?"", pointing to my feet not having shoes on by saying ""did you forget those?"" (they were by the door to leave), and when I asked her if I should bring a jacket she kinda dismissively responded by saying ""yes, you always complain when you don't have it."" I tried to play it off but the barrage of criticisms kinda got to me. Then, when we finally walked out the door she immediately turned around and said ""it's actually too hot now, I need to change."" This upset me further, it felt like all of her poking fun at me was because I was taking too long and now I actually took so long that she wasn't ready anymore.

When we were driving to the park, I could tell I was offended but that she really didn't mean any harm by it, and tried to take my mind off it by reading a book on my phone. She noticed I was being quiet and less excited and asked if anything was wrong, so I told her that my feelings were a little hurt by the comments she made, but I knew it wasn't her intention and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I was just trying to take my mind off of it. Her tone shifted pretty low and she apologized and explained that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just trying to be silly. I said thank you for the apology, I know you didn't mean anything bad, I think just the amount of poking and my feeling guilty caused me to take it personally, and I think I just needed to hear that apology. She didn't say anything else for the next few minutes, so I asked her if she was alright, and I could see tears start rolling down her cheeks as she said ""we barely even started our weekend and I've already ruined it, we couldn't even make it one car ride."" At this point she fully broke down and was sobbing, I tried to reassure her that nothing was ruined, I really appreciated her apology, and it truly wasn't a big deal, I just got my feelings hurt but it's okay we're still going to have a great day and I'm excited to spend time with you. She was totally withdrawn, just repeating about how she always manages to upset me, she's always messing things up, we can't go one weekend, etc.

I don't know how to handle this. The last thing I want to do is make my girlfriend walk on eggshells around me, and I know how horrible it can feel to love somebody so much but everything you do is never enough. Again, I've been in an abusive relationship, I am intimately familiar with how drastically things can suck when the person you love is never satisfied by you. I really don't think I'm doing this! I did tell her she hurt my feelings, but I also said it's not a big deal, I appreciate her apology, I know she didn't mean for it to hurt me, and I am still excited for our hike.

I don't want to cause problems, but I don't want expressing that my feelings were hurt by something to be a problem. I really thought it would be a small thing that she'd say sorry for and we could just continue on with our lovely weekend. Instead, she's inconsolable in our bedroom and I'm sitting on the couch feeling a mix of guilt and concern. How do I even begin to navigate this? I thought our relationship was perfect and everything was wonderful, but now I'm worried she's correct and we are arguing too often, and that I'm just too sensitive and the reason why feels like she's always doing something wrong, and she'd be better off without me. I truly just want her to be happy and it breaks my heart to think she isn't and it's specifically because she thinks she's making my life unhappy :(

For what it's worth, I am in therapy and have been for the past year, and am currently trialling different medications to help with my mental health (it's a long story). My girlfriend has never had therapy or any mental health treatment and has a lot of childhood trauma related to therapy that's kept her from seeking it. I have encouraged her to try it in the past because it's not uncommon for her to treat herself really harshly when things go wrong even outside of our relationship.

TL;DR: My girlfriend thinks we argue too much and that she's always upsetting me. I want to be able to tell her when something bothers me without it becoming a major issue, and can't tell if I am toxic and actually just blaming her too often, or if she's overreacting.

Dr. Beck is awesome - no bingos or pushback. The day of, she simply went over again the fact that the surgery is a permanent, irreversible sterilization measure (I was like ""thank god"" lol) and also went over the benefits of it, including a lowered risk of ovarian cancer. I saw her twice total so far, the day of consult and the day of surgery. I do sorta wish I had scheduled a secondary pre-op with her to get more of my surgery-specific questions answered in a less rushed environment, but it worked out. She is very skilled, efficient and thorough and does not try to talk you out of your decision.

Side note: while she was in there she looked for endometriosis (as my mom has it and I have painful periods) and did find powder burn lesions and filmy adhesions, though apparently it's pretty mild as far as endo goes. This is going off my post-op notes and I will need to get more information from her at my appointment in 2 weeks. I did not see her after the surgery.


PRE-OP:

The rest of this post has more to do with the hospital system (Endeavor Health) than with Dr. Beck. I find it very typical of hospital systems in Chicago; I had a breast reduction at a different Chicago hospital a year and a half ago and it was pretty similar. As with any surgery, I did need to be my own advocate, know which questions to ask, pay attention, write everything down. American healthcare is not as forthcoming as I'd wish with information about my body or what's going to happen to it, but the information is available upon request. I was however thankful for the fairly detailed post-op notes in my patient portal. As someone with a bit of medical trauma from early childhood, it's important to me to know as much as possible about what's going to happen and what to expect, and what actually happened. I tried to emotionally prepare a lot by visualizing what was going to happen to my body, talking to my body parts that would be affected, etc. (This may sound woo-woo to those unfamiliar with somatic therapy techniques lmao - but I'm hoping it helps give me a smoother recovery).

A couple weeks after the consult, the scheduling department reached out to schedule the surgery for 2 months later. Then the hospital had me do labs and a pre-op clearance appointment with my primary care doc (not Dr. Beck). I didn't have one, so they assigned one. This went fine. I was given an echocardiogram during this appointment due to an early childhood heart surgery, and this went fine - I was happy they didn't make me see my cardiologist in the suburbs, as this would have delayed the surgery. I had a long list of questions, some of which this doctor could answer, some no. 

About a week before the surgery, I got a call from someone in pre-surgical services to confirm the time, though was warned the time could change right up to the afternoon before surgery. He gave me instructions on each medication I was taking, things like ""stop taking aspirin now"" or ""you can take trazodone the night before surgery but not day of."" He was super nice and I ended up calling back about 4 times to ask for confirmation on different things, like being able to drink black coffee the morning of the procedure, as I didn't want to get a caffeine withdrawal headache! 

I also called Dr. Beck's office to request that any post-surgical medications be sent to my pharmacy in advance, and I'm so glad I did, because they were out of one of the prescriptions and I would have had to wait days after surgery for it to be filled! I was prescribed hydrocodone + acetaminophen, 600 mg ibuprofen and 500 mg acetaminophen. It's been a very nice and effective med combo so far.


DAY OF SURGERY:

My surgery was scheduled for 2 pm and I had to arrive by 12:30. No eating past midnight the night before. Could drink clear fluids (still water, clear apple juice and black coffee) till 10am. I was worried about how hungry I'd be, but I was mostly just nervous and thirsty. They had told me to shower that morning and wash my hair, but no leave-in product, lotion or makeup. I looked AWESOME lol. This was my personal decision, but I took special care to clean my belly button throughly with Hibiclens and a q-tip because it is very deep and prone to infection, and I was pretty sure one of the incisions would be there (I was right).

I brought a small bag for my stuff - glasses and case, a change of underwear just in case, phone charger, wallet, keys, etc. I wore a large comfy t-shirt, no bra, loose fitting sweatpants, very loose fitting high waisted cotton underwear (in a larger size than I normay wear - important so as to not scratch incisions), comfy socks, slip-on shoes, hair in a loose bun secured with soft scrunchie. My friend drive me to the drop-off area and I checked in at the surgery desk. I filled out a little card with the name of my other friend who was picking me up and her contact info. The hospital updated her several time on my status throughout, so that was nice! 

Took a pregnancy test - I informed the nurse it would be immaculate conception it turned out positive, and got a laugh - then changed into my gown and scrolled on my phone in between different nurses coming in. Dr. Beck came in and I was able to finally ask my questions about the procedure (things like, will I be catheterized? Will I be intubated? Can you please be careful with the intubation so I don't have a severe sore throat for 2 weeks again? Will you use a uterine manipulator and what can I expect to feel afterward? Will I have steri-strips on my incisions? When can I shower?). I don't like that they only give you post-op care instructions AFTER the surgery when your brain is swimming with drugs and pain, but that is American hospitals and not the fault of anyone working there. 

Then the IV went in and I was wheeled to the OR, scooted onto the table, started breathing through the mask, and......woke up in recovery. Waking up was ROUGH. Completely disoriented, shaking, crying hysterically. I felt very alone and in pain and wanted a hug so bad. A nurse touched my shoulder and reassured me that I was safe and everything was ok. Some fentanyl was added to my IV and I started to calm down, though I kept bursting into tears at random moments throughout the day, mostly at the pain but also for no reason at all. (I feel the need to emphasize that this had nothing to do with my decision to have the surgery - I was simultaneously relieved and so happy to be sterilized, and my first question was ""was it successful?"" I think my body was just having a normal stress reaction, and from what I know about the way the body releases trauma, crying and shaking might have actually been a very healthy response.)

I felt some pretty intense cramping, like bad period pain. Incisions were mildly stinging but not too bad. Also felt like I had to pee really bad, but the nurse explained to me that my bladder was actually empty and this sensation was from the catheter being removed. My throat was dry and I kept wanting to cough (which hurt) but thankfully it is not sore like last time! Even with a scopolamine patch, I had pretty bad nausea and was given saltine crackers and ginger ale, which helped. All the nurses were wonderful, patient, kind. I was wheeled to a different recovery room and given a large cup of water. They told me to drink it and then I'd try peeing, but it had to be a certain output or I'd have to try again. Finally a nurse led me to a bathroom and HOLY CRAP the pee burn. 😫 It was very much like having a UTI - burning, followed by painful urgency after my bladder was empty. (They tell you to drink a LOT of water to flush out that feeling, and I can confirm it works). I was also bleeding onto a hospital provided pad and mesh underwear. Fun times.

Went back to recovery and was still in a lot of pain, so was given a hydrocodone pill to get it under control. At this point the dreaded gas pain kicked in. It was starting to move all over my chest cavity and up into my shoulders, so I started crying again. Felt like I couldn't take a deep breath. Unfortunately pain meds (including Gas-x) do not touch this. I figured out that moving into the pain rather than crouching away from it helps; if your shoulder hurts, move it, massage it. The gas moved pretty quickly and on day 2 I am VERY lucky not to have much. Then they called my friend, and I got dressed, and she took me home and we had tacos. 😭 I was still pretty nauseous, but eating a little bit anyway helped immensely. 

I took a second hydrocodone before bed, and slept well despite waking up 4x to pee (each time less painful). Today it's mostly pain in my belly and nausea. But it's getting better. I'm so, so glad to have this surgery behind me. 


BILLING:

Billing is a mess, I'm not gonna lie. Though I have yet to find a hospital whose billing is not a mess. Had to call about 5 different peoe to chase down what CPT codes were being used, and even now I don't trust them. I got pretty confused about insurance and who to call in what order to argue that it should be covered at 100% (no copay, coinsurance or deductibles apply under the ACA, as I've confirmed my plan is ACA compliant). They of course sent me an estimate for around $1500 two days before surgery, and I decided at that point to just wait till afterward to deal with arguing. The estimate included an item ""hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy"" that I had to look up, as it was not a procedure Dr. Beck and I had discussed, and when I asked her about it, she was like, ""Yeah, that's not part of our plan for today, they just have sent you the wrong estimate."" 😒 Good thing I didn't pre-pay! I was not asked for any payment day-of. I will be calling my insurance once I get the actual bill I guess. 

Please feel free to ask questions about my experience!

What stings the most is that you walked away and I didn’t even have a chance to protest. I didn’t know you were leaving until you were already gone.


It was a quiet, deafening exit; the kind that makes you realize the person was never really there to begin with.


Maybe you thought I’d forget, that the absence of your words, your touch, your presence would fade away like ink on an old letter. But here I am, and here you are, still everywhere.


Every place I’ve been since, I can trace your shadow... your seat next to mine, late-night conversations, your coffee cup, your slippers, your polaroids, your jewelry. It’s all packed away, but it’s all still here.


To think, I believed something so fragile could survive outside its own delusions.


Do you know how long I’ve been sitting here, waiting for you to reach out, even though I know it’s long over? I don’t know if it’s love, hopelessness, or just the aftertaste of something broken. But it is something I thought would get better in time, but it never did. It just lingers like stale air in an unopened room.


I know it sounds insane. Like I’m talking about you as though you’re still here. But there’s something about you that refuses to leave. You left, but you didn’t really leave me. And maybe that’s the part I’ll never understand.

It doesn't crush you, not instantly anyway, but it's like a thousand small needles that go down straight into the soul and just soak it dry.


It’s been longer than I thought this pain would last. I thought I’d wake up one day and shake it off, but it hasn’t gone. There are still days when I expect a text from you, when I check my phone, waiting for a call that never comes.


You walked away. But you never really left. And I’m stuck with that... with *this* lingering ache, this endless wait for a goodbye that never came.


I’ll never understand why you chose to leave. Maybe you were just tired. Maybe you didn’t know how to say goodbye, so you chose nothing instead. Or maybe you felt I wouldn’t understand. But what I do know for sure is that I’m still holding on to a version of you that may no longer exist.

He goes to sleep at 10 and felt like the whole world needs to be in tune with his weird schedule. He was sending me messages for around 2 weeks of how I bother him by talking in my apartment and how we aren’t allowed to talk or have people over. Like I’m a child or something and we live in a dorm. We are both grown ass men around 30. We rent from the same company and he kept on filing complaints and kept on telling me I’m breaking the contract we both signed which obviously doesn’t say anything about having people over after 10 which is ridiculous AF.

I usually start off nice and tried every solution for about 2 weeks. I cleaned all the common areas which weren’t cleaned for months it seemed like. I brought him coffee a few times and invited him to lunch which he was happy to accept. To maintain noise levels down i went above and beyond. I oiled my doors with WD40 so they don’t squeak, had no one over but my girlfriend at night, started watching movies with my headphones on and didn’t eat late at night either which is actually hard since I work US hours and usually do my work at night since I live in Spain. I do programming so it’s pretty quiet work just typing of the keyboard. I even bought him 3 types of ear plugs that cost me around 80€ total to try to keep the peace with this ass clown.

The other day after yet another love letter telling me I can’t talk in my own place I snapped and went off on his punk ass and scared the hell out of him. He is around 6 foot 3 and he hid behind his bed like a bitch. The precise moment when the roles changed and he really saw what neighbor problems can be like. 👍

This led me to believe that he might call the cops on me later on since he immediately left the building (I did not go in to whoop his ass since that’s breaking and entering along with a potential assault charge).

He ended up not calling the cops but filed another complaint against me. Which was kind of his mistake. I told the landlord that I don’t have issues and that he is hearing voices in his head and to kiss my ass and hung up. Then I typed up a python script that records the decibel level of my apartment and went through the noise laws in Spain very carefully. The law states that insulation should dampen 55dB air noise (talking, music and so on) and 60dB of impact noise (footsteps doors closing) so that the bedrooms of neighboring apartments have a noise level of 35dB (measured minimum 1m from the wall and 1-1.5m above the floor) if that is not the case it is up to the property owner to retrofit insulation so that it is up to standards (which our walls are not, obviously). That told me that legally I can have my apartment blaring music at around 90 dB and he can’t legally say shit to me about it as it is a structural problem and out of my hands.

I also created a web portal for him to monitor the exact decibels live in my apartment with links to the law, the agency that we rent from my lawyer as well as mental health tips and in depth links to research that explains why quiet sleep is important for the human body as a huge fuck you to him.

I then started sending him tutorials on how to use the web portal and even updated it hoping to get on his nerves as much as humanly possible. And explained to him in video format how this is my evidence and he has nothing but a whiny mouth to back his shit up. I showed him the mic I used (DJI) and the full log that took measurements 20 times per second between 10PM and 10AM.

I also proceeded to maintain the decibel levels at precisely 85 so I am within the legal limits and after he couldn’t sleep for around 3-4 days he moved out. Didn’t even say good bye. 😢

My cherry on top was then sending him one last message that was just this emoji-> 🏆

For context this is typically how my wake ups go:

- wake up panicked and confused
- muscles sore and heavy
- naseaous 
- the occasional throbbing head
- im awake enough to get up and do stuff but often start to fall asleep doing things
- If I get up and walk im extremely off balanced and often run into things like walls or have trouble opening doors
- tired (duh)

Now ik thats not a normal wake up, but I expected the average person to wake up tired like me (but maybe not with all the other symptoms of sleep apnea)! Im not even talking about crazy tired, just like tired and groggy for a bit till they get their coffee or whatever!

When I woke up with my CPAP, I woke up in a way Ive never woken up like before! I only slept 5-6 hours too so I was expecting to be more tired! 

- I wake up and after like 2 sec, I know exactly whats happening, where I am, Im so aware
- Im not naseaous in the slightest
- my body feels light and easy to move
- I get up to use the bathroom and walk there with perfect balance!

It was if id been awake FOR HOURS! 

Dose everyone else REALLY wake up like this or am I seriously just getting better sleep than the average person with a CPAP? I feel like whenever ive slept over with my friends who dont have sleep apnea (at least to my or their knowledge) they wake up so much more tired and heavy! Im actually considered a morning person despite my sleep apnea (waking up in terror really... well wakes you up lol)

1o43buz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_chemex4coffee/comments/1o43buz/biocoffee_the_future_of_sustainable_specialty/,Bio‑Coffee — The Future of Sustainable Specialty Farming,"In recent years, the term **“Bio‑Coffee”** has gained traction in the specialty coffee world, representing a movement toward balance between high quality and environmental sustainability.

Bio‑coffee is more than just pesticide‑free organic farming; it’s a holistic agricultural philosophy that redefines the relationship between farmers, soil, water, biodiversity, and community.



Traditional coffee farms often rely on chemical fertilizers and pesticides to boost production, but this depletes soil fertility and pollutes groundwater.

Bio‑farming, on the other hand, uses **closed natural cycles** — plant waste becomes compost, shade trees regulate microclimates, and biodiversity maintains pest control naturally.

The yield may be smaller, but the flavor complexity and terroir expression are far greater.



A pioneering example is **Finca Deborah** in Panama, which applies precise biodynamic methods. The farm uses microbial soil analysis to time natural fertilization and employs AI systems to monitor microclimates around each coffee row.

Cup profiles from these farms show greater flavor clarity, often scoring above 90 points in international competitions like the Cup of Excellence.



Experts predict that biodynamic and regenerative farming will soon become the gold standard for specialty coffee brands aiming to combine luxury taste with environmental responsibility.

Bio‑coffee isn’t a passing trend — it’s a logical evolution toward a more conscious, sustainable future for coffee.

1o43ba0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o43ba0/iso_new_machine_500_or_under/,ISO New Machine [$500 or under],"Hi everyone, I'm in search of a new espresso machine. I have this $100 DeLonghi espresso machine (see pic) that is very basic and have been using it for the past 10 years (clearly what it lacks in function it makes up in longevity). I love espresso but I'm definitely no expert in what makes a machine ""good"". I'm ready to graduate to a better machine but from the minimal research I've done I've seen that the better ones can take typically \~20 min to heat up and I definitely don't give myself 20 minutes in my morning routine for coffee. I'm looking to spend no more than $500 so obviously that limits what machines I can even get. I also never use the milk steamer, partially because I prefer iced and partially because I know it's harder to steam nondairy milk, but now that it's getting colder again I could see myself getting into that a bit. Overall that feature is not important to me. I was looking at machines in my price range and I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews about the Breville Bambino - does anyone recommend this *knowing* the machine I'm starting from? Or is it not much of an upgrade? Are there any other machines under $500 that would be better if I'm making the investment? I admit I really like the aesthetics of it lol but if it's not going to last me a long time or be worth the money then I might as well go with a different one.

Enter the Japanese **Hario V60**, now the global symbol of manual brewing and precision craftsmanship.



The genius lies in its simplicity: a 60-degree angle ensures balanced flow, while the single large hole at the bottom allows the brewer full control over pouring speed — and thus extraction.

With the V60, the result depends less on the tool and more on the user’s skill, timing, and understanding of how water and coffee interact.



What makes the V60 ideal for specialty coffee is its **scientific flexibility**. Every variable can be tuned — grind size, water temperature, pour rate, and even spiral motion.

Modern baristas now use digital sensors and programmed pour curves via **Poursteady** and **Acaia Brewguide**, turning brewing into a form of coffee engineering.



Yet, despite all the tech, the V60 preserves its soul — a pure, transparent cup that expresses the bean’s character with honesty.

That balance between science and artistry is why it remains the top choice in World Brewers Cup competitions worldwide.



The V60 isn’t just a tool — it’s a philosophy: calm, control, and care in every pour.

1o439zb,https://i.redd.it/eoclkcw92juf1.jpeg,AIO My partner went out to dinner with a former co-worker,"I (F43) have been with my partner (M42) for almost 23 years, we have been faithful and still like each other :) (well most of the time anyway). For context: We live in Western Europe.

My partner switched jobs last year and keeps in touch with some of his co-workers, through instagram and WhatsApp. I have met most of his former co-workers. We have an open phone policy, I am nosy, he often forgets to share things so we read each other’s apps and ask about what we read. Not because we don’t trust each other but to stay in the loop.

A few weeks ago I read an app from a former female co-worker about catching up sometime. She called it a date; “We still have to plan that date to catch up.” He said he thought that was a great idea. A little raised eyebrow from me, but I trust him so no big red flags but it was on my radar. I did tell him I would appreciate a heads up or a check in with me if I was comfortable with that. I also said that I was fine with them having coffee but was not comfortable with her calling it a date, or them developing a friendship. He saw my point.

I kinda forgot about it until he texted me: Hey, would it be okay if I meet up with Penelope? I thanked him for checking in and said that I was okay with that. Yay, proud of us, well communicated.

It turned up in our mutual calendar. “After work drinks with Penelope.” I asked him about it, saying something to the effect of “I thought you were going for coffee? When did it turn into drinks after work?” He said something like how this worked out better schedule wise, they both had work etc. I mentioned that drinks at 17.00 would probably mean dinner too. He said nah, maybe some bites but that was it. Ookaaaay.

I thought about it for a bit but I didn’t entirely feel comfortable with it. 

They picked a place to meet up, after a few days I checked it out and it was something I knew he wouldn’t enjoy and was also out of our budget. I texted him asking if he saw the menu there and that it was too expensive. He checked it, agreed and they switched locations. To… A sushi restaurant. 

What. The. Helly. 

So I asked him about it. He started getting a little defensive and was not happy about me not thinking this was a great idea. I tried to explain why I was uncomfortable of him going out to dinner with another woman but he did not see my point at all. He got angry and said I was acting jealous, how it wouldn’t be an issue if he had gone to dinner with a man and how that was sexist of me. I told him I wasn’t going to tell him he couldn’t go but that yes, to me it makes a difference whether he went out with a man or a woman. He thought that was ridiculous. I don’t know, maybe it is but is not something I am comfortable with.

So they went out to dinner. I don’t really know how it went, because when he got home at 21.30 (they met up at 17.00) I was pissed at how late it was and also I wasn’t sure how you’re supposed to act when your partner has gone out with another woman so I kind of acted like a dcik. He came home wanted to check in and I told him I wasn’t interested in him being cute or affectionate at that time. That pissed him off so we went to bed angry.

We haven’t discussed it much since. We tried to talk it out but started to turn into an argument again so we kinda left it alone after that.

He texted her for her half of the bill (he paid initially), lol does this give away in which country we live? She texted him thanks, and how she would’ve felt bad if he had not venmo’d her and that was that. Throughout this I kind of jokingly checked in with my sisters if they would be okay with their husbands going out to dinner with another woman and that was a no. 

But tonight she texted him again. She texted him a picture of a sushi dish of 2 fried dough balls on a plate to make them look like boobs with “cheers”. Chat, I was not really amused. I asked him what it meant he jokingly said: They’re boobs! And I was like: Erm, weird. And he said something like noo, they’re dough balls we had them last week you are overreacting. And I was like: No, that’s weird. I’ll check in with Reddit to see if they think this is overreacting. So, here I am. 

Am I overreacting, as my partner thinks I am, or am I appropriately reacting?

1o438eg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o438eg,OutIn Mino: First Impressions.,"
Hi, everyone! How are you doing?

The Mino has arrived, and I'd like to share my first impressions with you. I'll be back at another time, if you're interested, to discuss the workflow, a comparison with the Nano, and a detailed analysis.

Unboxing Experience: Everything you, as owners of any OutIn equipment, already know: everything is well-made, fitted, protected, and visually appealing. The Mino comes with a carrying bag, a USB charging cable, a basket with a capacity for 12 grams of coffee, an adapter for Nespresso capsules, a foldable spoon (which also serves as a tamper), a dosing funnel, a basket removal tool (which is very helpful during cleaning), the manual, a leaflet with a QR code to activate the warranty, and stickers. A great experience, as always.

Construction: It's made of food-grade plastic, stainless steel, and silicone, and includes a BPA-free Tritan™ cup. It is 24% smaller than the Nano (I plan to do a technical comparison, so for now, I just want to share my initial impressions as a user, without deep comparisons). It features a clean design and a great grip (the rubberized body helps prevent potential accidents). The Mino has an IP67 protection rating, making it water and dust resistant, which allows for more freedom when preparing your espresso (without the worry of, for example, water dripping and damaging the machine).

Because it has a larger base (even without the cup attached), you feel secure placing it on the countertop, without fear of it slipping and falling to the floor, for instance.

Total Charging Time: Approximately 45 minutes.

Espresso Shots per Charge with Room 

Temperature Water: Up to six shots.

Espresso Shots per Charge with Pre-Heated 

Water: More than 500 shots.

Self-Heating Time (Room Temperature Water): 149 seconds.

Cleaning: Here is an important point, in my opinion: It releases almost 100% of the water during extraction, delivering a dry and uniform basket, ready to be removed with the basket removal tool. No burnt fingers, no tiny puddles of water. Easy and quick to clean.
Another point regarding cleaning is that, because it has an IP67 rating, you don't need to be extremely cautious when cleaning it. If water drips, it's fine. Continue cleaning and dry the machine afterward.


Now, what I believe is your real curiosity: Is the Mino worth buying? Honestly... I'm still adjusting the flow and getting to know the machine, but yes, it delivers a flavorful, complex, and consistent espresso. Is it worth buying the Mino even if you already own a Nano? Although I prefer to give a more precise answer after using it for longer, what I can say is: It gives me a more flavorful coffee, but I don't have the basket plus. Therefore, I can only compare the starter kit vs. the starter kit – and again, I need more time with it for a more concrete answer. And yes: There have been significant improvements, especially if your profile is that of an adventurer or someone who needs a machine that is more resistant to impacts, extreme temperatures, or if you do not own the basket plus.

I'll be back in a few weeks to give a more precise report and, if you'd like, a comparison with the Nano.

I've added an unboxing video and some extraction photos (keep in mind that the beans used are relatively old. Roast date is late August. I will receive new beans this week).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me here, and I'll be happy to answer.

Have a great weekend!

P.S.: Please keep in mind that English is not my native language. Also, I spent the entire night editing the unboxing video and testing new clicks and recipes with Fino and Mino. I went to sleep at 5:55 AM, woke up at 8:00 AM, and immediately went to make more espresso with her. After all that, I wrote this report for you. I apologize if there are any grammatical errors or flaws in the text.

​My schedule often revolves around the football calendar, and I'm looking for someone who appreciates both the roar of the crowd and the quiet moments in between.
​A little about me:

​When FC Barcelona is playing, you'll find me completely invested. Whether it's a late-night Champions League match or a weekend league game, I'm all in. I love the energy and the shared emotion of it all, and I'm just as happy explaining the offside rule (for the tenth time, patiently) as I am celebrating a goal.

While I love the game, it's not my whole life. My ideal downtime could also be finding a hidden gem of a cafe in the city, getting lost in a great new series, or just taking a long walk and talking about our dreams and ridiculously bad jokes.
I'm a firm believer that true connection comes from the little things—remembering your favorite coffee order, listening just to listen, and offering a comforting hug after a long day. I value open communication and genuine affection over playing games.

​ My aim is to create a relaxed, warm space where we can both feel completely ourselves. Think comfy sofas, sharing a playlist, and enjoying easy, comfortable silence as much as we enjoy conversation.
​I'm hoping to find someone who's looking for a connection that's both exciting and deeply comforting. Someone who can get passionate about their interests, but also knows how to unwind and cherish the simple, intimate moments.

​If the idea of cheering for a last-minute winner and then settling in for a heartfelt chat sounds perfect to you, I'd love to hear from you.",1,1760207916.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Heya reddit,

Just a 37 year young laidback guy who thinks coffee is a food group, motorcycles are therapy, and Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough is a valid life choice.😌

I live somewhere between caffeine highs and near-death experiences on two wheels, and honestly, it’s a good balance.👀

I ride a lot, it’s cheaper than therapy and way more effective. However with winter approaching i wont be riding much. This is were you step in...😝🤣

Don't worry, ialso know how to slow down. I value my downtime. Candles, blankets, too many pillows, and Netflix playing something I’ll probably fall asleep to halfway through. I call it “aggressive relaxation.” It’s a lifestyle choice.🤭

I also enjoy snowboarding. Sadly my country is flat...so yeah, im focked🤣 and I lift weights occasionally so my ego doesn’t get too comfortable. Basically, I like staying active enough to justify eating like I’m training for a carb marathon.

I have a soft spot for music that actually feels like something, whether that’s a guitar solo that hits like nostalgia or a beat that makes you nod along like you just figured life out. My playlists are chaotic, my humor is worse, and my cooking skills depend entirely on how close the nearest takeout place is.

I’m fluent in sarcasm, caffeine addiction, and pretending I know what I’m doing. If you can handle someone who smiles often, rides too fast, and probably drinks way too much coffee, we’ll get along fine.☕️

Random fun fact:

I actually prefer a good glass of red wine over a beer.🍷

Looking for someone who can hold a conversation that doesn’t feel like small talk, someone smart, grounded, maybe a little rebellious. Bonus points if you can appreciate dark humor, good music, late-night rides, and the kind of banter that gets you both laughing at inappropriate moments.

If that sounds like your kind of chaos, say hi. Worst case, we share some bad jokes and good music. Best case, we end up with matching helmet hair.

I usually end positive so, here it comes;

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mastery**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like we’re squeezing lemons over a post-game celebratory mimosa. The **Seattle Sounders** are the clear favorites here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.70** (implying a **59% chance to win**) across most books. Real Salt Lake? They’re priced at **4.3** (a **19% chance**), which is about as likely to pull off an upset as a Seattleite predicting a sunny weekend. The draw sits at **3.9** (\~25.6%), suggesting this could be a tense, low-scoring affair—perfect for fans who enjoy watching two teams play chess with a soccer ball.

The spread tells a similar story: Sounders are favored by **0.5 to 0.75 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win narrowly. Meanwhile, the total goals line is split between **3.0 and 3.5**, with **“Under”** priced slightly more attractively. If you’re betting on chaos, this isn’t your game.

**Digesting the News: Pedro’s Precision and RSL’s Rollercoaster**  
The Sounders just edged the Portland Timbers **1-0**, thanks to a *“I’ve got a master’s in timing”* goal from **Pedro de la Vega**. Their defense? Tighter than a Starbucks apron on a busy Friday morning. At fifth in the Western Conference, they’re playing like a team that’s had 12 hours of sleep, a full breakfast, and a clear game plan.

Real Salt Lake, meanwhile, are a ninth-place enigma. They beat the Colorado Rapids 1-0 last time out, but their season has been more “yo-yo” than “elevator.” Are they a sleeper? Possibly. Are they a consistent threat? Not unless you count “threatening to break the tie” in a 1-1 draw. Their attack lacks the zip of a Seattle raincloud—present, but not exactly electrifying.

The Breathing
The sound hasn’t stopped.

It’s soft, steady, right against my ear—warm exhalations brushing the tiny hairs on the back of my neck.

I don’t dare move.

Because if I move, I’ll have to admit he’s really there.

I told myself last night that I imagined it. That the buzzing webcam light, the phantom breaths, the sudden chill in my room—those were tricks of exhaustion.

But when I woke this morning, the indentation was still in the chair beside my bed. As if someone had sat there all night.

Watching me.

I tried to leave the apartment. Grabbed my keys, shoved on a hoodie. But when I opened the front door, something invisible pressed it shut from the other side.

Hard.

No matter how much I pushed, it wouldn’t budge.

Then—fingers. Ice-cold. Sliding across the back of my hand still gripping the doorknob.

I yanked away, stumbled backward. The door swung open freely.

The hallway was empty.

But I know what I felt.

Max had touched me.


I avoided my laptop all day. No screens. No mirrors. I even pulled the batteries from my phone and shoved it in a drawer.

But it didn’t matter.

When I glanced at the microwave door while making coffee, his face stared back at me in the reflection.

When I washed my hands in the bathroom, his grin spread across the surface of the water before rippling away.

When I tried to nap on the couch, I woke up to my TV flickering on by itself.

And there he was, sitting on my couch in the static.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I screamed. Threw a glass at the screen. The TV shattered, sparks flying.

But even as the screen went dark, the static face lingered, burned into the shards.

Smiling.


I found myself going through old things. Boxes in the closet I hadn’t opened since Max died.

Photos. Letters. The stupid comic we drew in middle school about two superheroes who couldn’t stop arguing.

Buried under it all was his old notebook. A journal he carried everywhere.

Most of it was filled with random doodles and inside jokes. But near the end—

The handwriting changed.

Shaky. Erratic.

One page said:

“Sometimes I dream I’m inside the walls. Watching you. Waiting for you to notice.”

Another:

“If I ever die, don’t forget me. Because if you forget, I’ll have to remind you.”

The last page wasn’t finished. Just three words, jagged and carved deep into the paper like he was pressing down too hard:

“LET ME IN.”


Tonight, it got worse.

I woke to a noise. A soft creak from the corner of the room.

I thought it was the house settling. Until I noticed the air smelled wrong—like damp earth and rotting leaves.

And then I saw it.

A shadow, darker than the rest of the dark, hunched in the corner.

At first it was shapeless. But slowly, it stretched upward, limbs unfolding, head tilting.

And then—features.

Max’s grin.

Max’s eyes.

He didn’t step forward. Didn’t move closer. Just stood there, impossibly tall, smile splitting his face in half.

And whispered my name.

Not in my ears. Not in my head.

Everywhere.

The walls, the floor, the ceiling—they all breathed it together:

“Come closer.”


I don’t know what time it is now. I’ve been hiding in my room with the lights on, writing this as fast as I can.

But just a few minutes ago, I heard it.

Three knocks on my window.

I live on the third floor.

I told myself not to look. I told myself to keep typing.

But curiosity won.

I turned.

And there he was.

Max.

Clinging to the glass from the outside, fingers twisted against the pane, smile stretched wider than ever. His eyes were pale and glassy, like something long dead and waterlogged.

And then, in foggy letters written across the inside of the glass, where I hadn’t touched it—

“Almost there.”

The Window

The glass creaked.

Max’s fingers scraped down the window, leaving streaks of something dark and wet. His grin stretched wider than the frame could contain, teeth pressing against the glass as if it would shatter from the pressure.

I staggered back. “You’re not real.”

His lips moved, though the words echoed inside my skull instead of outside it.

“You asked for me.”

“No—” My voice cracked. “I didn’t!”

“You typed it. You opened the door. I was waiting.”

The glass bulged inward, warping, trembling. I bolted for the door, but when I grabbed the knob—ice-cold fingers were already there.

I froze.

Max was inside.


I stumbled backward as the lights flickered. The room stretched wrong, corners bending in on themselves.

And Max stepped into the glow.

His face wasn’t like I remembered. It was as though someone had stretched his features over a frame too large, skin pulled taut, mouth splitting ear to ear. His eyes were hollow but burning, dark pits that swallowed the light.

“Why are you here?” I whispered.

He tilted his head. “Because you never said goodbye.”

My throat closed. He was right—I hadn’t. At the funeral, I couldn’t bring myself to speak. Couldn’t face the casket. I left early, walked home in silence.

And he’d followed me.


“I can’t stay,” I said. “You’re dead. You’re not supposed to be here.”

Max’s grin faltered. For the first time, his face softened, almost human.

“Then let me in,” he said gently. “One last time. Just for a little while. You owe me that.”

I shook my head. “If I let you in, I won’t come back out.”

His grin snapped back into place. “Exactly.”


He lunged.

Cold hands wrapped around my face, pressing hard, forcing my eyes open. The world warped. My walls peeled away, my ceiling stretched upward. I was somewhere else—surrounded by screens, thousands of them, all flashing the same image:

Me.

Every screen showed me at different moments of my life. Laughing with Max. Crying alone. Staring at a coffin. Typing at my desk.

And in every single frame, Max was there.

Standing just behind me.

Watching.

The images flickered faster, until they blurred, until I couldn’t tell which version of myself was real anymore.

Then I felt it—his breath, hot and rancid, right against my ear.

“This is forever now.”


I woke up in my bed.

Morning sunlight spilling across the sheets. My laptop closed. My phone silent.

For a moment, I thought I’d dreamed it all.

But then I noticed the smell. Damp earth. Rotting leaves.

And my phone buzzed.

One new notification.

From Max.

Not the AI. Not a program.

From my contacts list.

I hadn’t saved his number since the accident. I couldn’t even bring myself to look at it. But there it was.

Message:

“Thanks for letting me in. :)”

My chest went ice-cold. Hands shaking, I clicked my front camera to check my reflection.

And froze.

Because the face staring back at me wasn’t mine.

It was his.

Max.

Smiling through my skin.


I don’t know if I’m writing this anymore.

Or if Max is.

But if you’re reading this—if you’ve made it to the end—don’t ever train an AI alone.

Don’t look too long at the faces in your photos.

And whatever you do, don’t forget your dead.

Because they’ll find a way back.

And when they do—

They won’t leave.",2,1760207354.0,creepypasta,2,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject:** Arthur Coldwater, Farsul Rescue

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\]:** January 23, 2137

After a few minutes the Venlil seemed to calm down, his bellowing sobs reduced to a few sniffles and hiccups. When I finally felt like he had calmed down a bit I stood up, reaching down and lifting the sad sheep up into my arms. That of course was no mean feat considering how dense he was for his size. Still, I managed to hold the sniffling alien in my arms and carefully started to make my way over to the couch.

“What are you doing?” He asked finally, looking up at me from my arms as he wiped one eye with the back of his paw.

“Gonna help my best pal feel better.” I grunted in reply, trying not to let on how difficult carrying him was. Damn he was muscular for his size. Carrying him like this I could feel his firm muscles even underneath all that wool. Ancient Skalgans must have been absolute brutes!

Finally, I reached the couch, attempting to lay the jet-black xeno down gently but only managing to drop him atop the sectional’s padded cushions.

“Arthur what…”

“One second.” I insisted, holding up my palm towards Jammek as I ran to the kitchen and opened the fridge. I reached way back into the vegetable crisper, finding the last little tub of apple sauce I had managed to hide for myself. Mixsel and Jammek were absolute fiends for these things. I had wanted to have a bit myself, but I figured Jammy needed it more just then. Snatching a spoon out of the drawer I hurried back to the living room. Jammek had curled himself up into a ball in the corner of the couch, clutching his knees to his chest.

“Is that…. I thought we were out!” He laughs, sniffling a little.

“Last one.” I said, handing him the spoon and tub. “Figured you could use the pick-me-up.” The Venlil eagerly took the tub, peeling back the lid and was about to dig in when he suddenly paused, looking back up at me with those big, blue eyes.

“Don’t you want some?” He asked. I simply shook my head in reply.

“Nah.” I assured him, “Not in the mood for it. I’ll just go ask for some more next time I’m at the concierge.” He eyed me suspiciously for a moment before finally digging in. I fought back a smile at the sight of the big, wooly alien scarfing down a children’s applesauce cup like it was the best thing he’d ever had.

It didn’t take Jammek long to finish his cup, finally setting the empty container down on the coffee table as I took a seat beside him. The Venlil didn’t hesitate to lean over against me, taking my hand and shamelessly placing atop his head. I fought the urge to laugh once more, taking his cue and digging my fingers into his wool. The alien seemed to relax, leaning into the petting and closing his eyes. I certainly didn’t mind the chance to play with that wool. It was like petting a cloud!

“Sorry for that.” He finally said, opening his eyes but staring at the floor rather than me, “I didn’t think that seeing that Venlil would… affect me like that.”

“No apologies Mon Ami.” I insisted, really letting my nails scratch on his scalp, “I’m just surprised you didn’t break down sooner…” I paused for a moment, debating whether to ask what I was thinking about or leave it be for now. Thankfully Jammek made that choice for me.

“She was so sweet when we were kids.” Jammek began, opening the very conversation I had wanted to hit on, “She tried so hard to fit in. Even with her disease she was always doing her best to keep up with the other pups. They would always leave her behind though. She was too slow. Couldn’t run for very long either.” I held my breath, waiting to see if the Venlil might start crying again. He uttered a few sniffles but otherwise seemed fine, “I wouldn’t though. I refused to leave her behind. Sometimes I’d even carry her on my back. After a while it became just me and her. A runt and his deformed sister. She couldn’t get a job. Nobody would hire her. She tried university but… Solgalik’s light! They were so mean to her Arthur. They tormented her until she dropped out. After that she holed herself up in our parent’s house. After they died the house came to me and I just sort of… started taking care of her. It wasn’t too bad at first. My writing brought in the money we needed, and she could still take care of herself. After a while though? She changed. Maybe it was losing mom and dad or just the endless isolation but… she just refused to get out of bed. Eventually she wouldn’t even talk. Eventually I spent all my time there taking care of her. I had to feed her, bathe her… everything. But I didn’t care. It was my little sister, and I promised her I wouldn’t leave her….” His voice began cracking as he reached this point in his story and I feared he was about to break down again.

“Depression don’t care what species you are it seems.” I sighed, wrapping my free arm around the sheep man’s side and giving him a gentle squeeze. He let out a sniffle, sucking back some mucus, but no more tears came.

“I hope she was ok Arthur… but… but I know better. I know what she did after I left.”

“First of all, you didn’t LEAVE,” I insisted, “you were kidnapped, and secondly what do you mean?”

“She wouldn’t leave the bed Arthur. We didn’t have any family or friends to check on her. I know what must have happened. She… she…”

Whatever the ball of black fluff in my arms was about to say got cut off as the front door flew open and enormous gray figure came stomping in. I jumped at the sudden movement, turning my gaze to find Izra’s hulking form coming in. I noticed she had worn the pair of polarized goggles the UN had given her to deal with the bright sunlight out to the park. They almost reminded me of scuba goggles. The sight would have been humorous if I hadn’t noticed the massive ball of mud cradled in her arms.

“Mon Dieu!” I exclaimed as I realized that the ball of mud was in fact Mixsel, “What happened?!?”

“There was an incident involving a creature that the UN personnel referred to as a duck.” Izra growled as she looked into the living room at us, “The hatchlings were under the impression it was another youngling and chased it straight into the pond.” Mixsel for her part seemed wholly unperturbed by her current condition and simply giggled, her little face just barely visible through the thick layer of mud on her.

“I’ll get the bath ready.” I sighed, pulling myself out from under Jammek and moving rapidly up the stairs. I noticed Izra’s covered gaze move between myself and Jammek before following me up the stairs with her squealing ball of filth. I moved over to the tub, quickly turning on the showerhead as Izra gently placed Mixsel into the tub. I began to diligently spray the giggling Sivkit down with water as Izra moved to the sink to wash off the mud that had been left on her scales.

“That duck was a Speh head!” Mixsel giggled as I took the showerhead and tried to get as much of that thick pond mud off her as I could before I ran her a bath.

“What does that mean?” I asked, looking over to Izra as she dried her arms on a nearby towel. The Arxur shrugged.

“Some silly word she and the other hatchlings kept saying.” She grumbled, “Just gibberish.”

“Well, you know what?” I announced, turning back to the sopping wet ball of fluff in the tub, “If he got you this muddy then he probably is a… uhh… speh head!” She giggled at that, clearly pleased to hear me use her silly little made-up word.

It took a good twenty minutes to get the Sivkit good and clean before finally drying her off. I set her down and patted her head, letting her run off downstairs to play with her coloring toys. I was silently thankful I hadn’t let her take Frank to the park or he would have been going for another round in the washing machine. I took a quick moment to wash off the few flecks of mud that got on my own arms before drying off and leaving the bathroom. I was about to make my way down the stairs when a faint noise from the room to my right caught my ear. Izra’s room.

I turned, tentatively creeping over to the partially opened door, pushing my eye up to the gap and peering inside. It was hard to see as dim as the room was. Izra kept her light out and had put a sheet up over her window the first day we were here. As I had come to learn, Arxur were naturally nocturnal hunters historically. They preferred very little light.

Finally, my eyes adjusted to the darkness, finding Izra on her knees, situated in a way that reminded me of someone groveling, the palms of her hands touching the ground in front of her. Her goggles had been removed and sat beside her on the floor.

“Did you need something friend Arthur?” She growled from the darkness, making me jump. I immediately blushed, feeling as though I had done something wrong without even meaning to.

“Sorry.” I replied, clearing my throat, “I just heard a noise and wondered what you were doing.”

“I am praying.” She replied bluntly, only serving to pique my curiosity. After a moment of hesitation, I decided to press my luck.

“Can I ask a question Izra?”

She let out a growl, finally shifting from the position I had found her in, looking up at me as she leaned back onto her knees.

“What?” She hissed.

“What do the Arxur worship exactly?” I inquired.

“Modern Arxur?” She replied with a sardonic chuckle, “Their own government I imagine. But in my time? Many things. In my country we worshiped our ancestors.” I stood there for a moment in silence, debating whether to continue. Finally, I just said to hell with it and asked my next question.

“What are you praying for?”

“I pray that my husband and daughter received a painless death.” She hissed in reply, her face utterly unreadable in the dark room, “I pray that they have saved a seat for me in the feasting hall of our ancestors.” Her voice hitched there, letting out a long, low, wheezing noise.

“I… I’m sure they will Izra.” I replied, feeling utterly ashamed of myself for even asking that question. Damn my curiosity. “You deserve a spot at the table with your ancestors.” I conveniently avoided even touching on the subject of her husband’s and daughter’s deaths. Although I could certainly understand where she was coming from. I know if I had woken up to find out that humanity had become like the Arxur I’d hope my boy died rather than become like that.

“Arthur.” She growled back, interrupting my thoughts, “I have a question for you now.”

“Of course.” I replied, more than happy to answer whatever she might ask after invading her privacy like that.

“What faith did you and your tribe follow?” She asked. I stood for a moment, peering into the room as those orbs of hers glowed back at me. Well, it was my own fault for bringing up religion I supposed.

“Well, my… tribe followed a faith called Christianity.” I replied. “They worshipped a single deity they believed created and ruled the universe.” There was a moment of palpable silence after that before Izra finally spoke up.

“You say this in a way to imply you do not follow the faith of your ancestors?” She remarked observantly.

“I do not.” I answered simply.

“Why?” She insisted.

“Well…” I struggled to answer that one. My mind swirled as I tried to come up with an explanation she might understand. “I grew up in a VERY religious home.” I explained, “We read out of our religion’s holy book at least once a day. The problem was…” I paused, fighting the old demons that came up any time I had to think about this.

“Yes?” Izra insisted once more, her eyes trained right on me.

“Well at a certain point I realized that no amount of praying or begging was going to change me. I finally got my mind around the fact that I was praying to a god that wanted people to stone me. So, I left that faith.” I replied with a sigh. The Arxur’s eerily glowing eyes continued to be trained on me, making me squirm anxiously.

“Stone you?” She repeated in a way that made it clear that she hadn’t understood what that meant.

“It was a form of execution.” I explained, feeling more than a little numb to all this after so long, “Where everyone would pick up rocks and throw them at someone until they died.” The Arxur sat there, her eyes glued to me for a solid moment.

“Was this your version of Betterment?” She asked at last, making me shake my head and even laugh at the question.

“Nah. Our version of Betterment was way worse than that.” I replied, “No. My religion just wanted people like me and a few other types of people dead. Our version of Betterment wanted a LOT more people dead.” She looked at me, her eerily glowing eyes blinking in surprise.

“Why would they wish you dead Arthur?” She growled, “You have proven an honorable and kind man. You are not deceptive, and you do not steal. I have not seen you horde food nor have I witnessed you overindulge in food. What crime could you have committed to deserve that? Have you killed a kinsman?” I made a silent note to myself that Arxur clearly valued that sort of thing. It seemed their list of sins was much MUCH shorter than the one I had grown up knowing.

“They thought I deserved that because I… didn’t love the right people.” I sighed. This response only resulted in an indignant huff from my Arxur friend.

“I bared my heart out to you friend Arthur. I gave you full honesty from my prayers. Do you not owe me the same?” Izra replied. I stood there, uncertain for a moment. She was right of course but… how would an alien even think about that? Would she be disgusted? Would she not understand? Would she not even care?

“The reason my own religion said I deserved death was… I don’t… well I don’t have an interest in females.” I sighed, feeling like I was trying to force a hot coal up through my throat. Izra simply sat and studied me for a moment, her head cocking slightly to the side.

“And?” She finally replied.

“And… what?” I answered, looking over at her. The Arxur looked both dumbfounded and deeply confused.

“That’s it? The fact you don’t wish to reproduce?” She hissed, “They wished to execute you for that? Because you preferred the company of males?”

“Well by my time executing people for that was illegal,” I explained, “But it didn’t stop people from… from removing us from their lives. When I finally admitted it I… I lost my family. My friends. Everyone. I was left all alone.” The space gator sat for a moment mulling that over before letting out a loud huff.

“If something as small as that was considered punishable by death…” She began, shaking her head, “I do not blame you for abandoning the ways of your forebears. If your god could not accept a good man like you… then he was not a god worth your time Arthur.”

“Thanks Izra.” I sighed, starting to close the door, “I’m really sorry for interrupting your prayers. I was just curious. I’ll see you downstairs.”

“Wait.” She interrupted, right before I was able to close the door. I looked back in, seeing the Arxur eying me curiously through the narrow slit, “Have you discussed this with Jammek?”

“Huh?” I responded with a chuckle, “Nah. Religion hasn’t come up between us.”

“I meant…” She paused whatever she was about to say, her slitted eyes examining me curiously before she finally continued, “Never mind.” She finished, letting out a series of heavy wheezes that my translator insisted were laughs. I eyed the Arxur for a moment longer, waiting to see if she would elaborate on that. When she continued her silence, I finally shut the door and left.



**Memory Transcription Subject:** Arthur Coldwater, Farsul Rescue

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\]:** January 27, 2137

The last few days had flown by uneventfully, aside from my frequent trips to the concierge. That had been mostly due to Izra’s steadily growing little band. After her and Onio had begun practicing in the back yard, a couple more of our neighbors had expressed an interest in joining them. Since the number of humans going around was limited (And apparently, we had gotten situated in the area with the absolute least number of humans) I had suddenly gotten volunteered to play go-for for the instrumental needs of Izra’s budding orchestra.

After Onio had come the Gojid, Kalen, that played the drum. Then there was the Tilfish from next door they had on the xylophone, Iskit. Finally, they had roped in the angry bird from the park, Islatta as a vocalist.

I had to admit though… there were worse ways to be woken up than to the sound of (what I would describe) as classical music accompanied to the melodies of birdsong. It was a strange thing to say the least. As I opened my eyes that morning, hearing them practicing in the back yard I couldn’t help but smile.

I pulled myself out of the bed, looking over at the holopad. 9:30am. That was more like it! Despite how tired I felt I was happy to be up at a decent hour. Pulling myself up out of the bed I quickly changed into a pair of jeans and a “UN LEADS THE WAY!” T-shirt. I made my way through the house over to the kitchen and peered out into the back yard, watching Izra and her strange little band practice in the back yard. They were, as expected, pretty wrapped up in their music. I smiled, watching the group practice. They were fairly good in my opinion, and I wasn’t even the classical music kind of guy. It was pretty sounding though. I couldn’t deny that.

I silently made a note to request a coffee maker from the concierge before moving to the pantry and pulling out a jerky stick for breakfast. I paused for a moment, listening to our local musicians’ tune as I ate. Couldn’t blame them for wanting to practice a bunch though. The UN was planning a cookout for the locals in two days, and they had been asked to play live music at the event. Even if Izra didn’t outwardly show pride at that, I know she felt it. I could see it in her reaction when Eva had stopped by to ask her about it.

With my salty meat snack devoured I made my way back through the living room to the front door. Jammek and Mixsel were still in bed so I decided to take the opportunity for a quick morning run. I quietly opened the door and slipped outside. It was still early in the year and the air had yet to lose the cold crispness of winter. I breathed it in, basking in the cold air and gentle warmth of the early morning sun’s rays.

I took off towards the park, determined to run to the other side of the camp and then circle back around to the house via the streets on the outskirts. I noticed a few people meandering around at the park as well as several more out in front of their houses. The whole place had seemed to become much livelier since they had announced the community cookout. It was nice to see. These people needed a minute to… well, just be people.

As I rounded the park and began my run down the other side of the camp, I noticed a familiar face talking to something resembling a gigantic, upright… hippopotamus? God there were so many aliens to learn. It was honestly dizzying how many people the Farsul had taken for their little collection.

“Hey Shuyi!” I shouted, jogging up to where they were and pausing for a moment. The woman turned, a smile plastered across her face once she saw me.

“Hello Arthur!” She greeted, giving me a wave, “How are you this morning?”

“Doing fine!” I laughed, “Woke up to a whole orchestra practicing in my back yard. Shuyi rolled her eyes at that.

“Well not to be too rude but I can’t say I’m disappointed to have Onio out of the house for a bit. Do you know he’s trying to write poetry now?”

“Poetry?” I chuckled, “What about?”

“Love poems from the sound of them.” She sighed, “He’s been asking for our ‘input’ on them.” She finished, putting quotations around the word “input”. I snickered at that, having an inkling at who those poems may have been directed toward. That crazy little lizard was either very brave or suicidal. “Speaking of…” She added, her pale cheeks flushing slightly, “I met someone.”

“Oooooh?” I teased, leaning in, “And who would that be?”

“My housemate Walter.” The hippo person laughed, giving Shuyi a playful shove.

“He’s from almost the same time period.” Shuyi mused, looking rather transfixed as she spoke, “He was a career military man. An Australian. I hope you get to meet him soon!”

“Well, I’d love to ask more about that, but I need to finish this run before my Munchkin wakes up and wants breakfast!” I laughed, giving her and her new hippo friend a quick wave before taking off again. “Good for her.” I thought. It was promising if after all this these people could still fall in love. Maybe there was hope that the residents here could move on with their lives. Maybe… I could too?

“You can’t.” The voice in my head hissed, fighting back against the very notion that I could have any kind of new life. “You’ll just fuck that up too. Like you do everything else. Better if you just…” I shook my head and just focused on my run. I didn’t need that type of thinking right now.

The sheer number of strange, unknown aliens I passed as I ran started to sink in. It was a scenario that I never would have imagined in my life. Me! Arthur Coldwater! Man of the past going on a casual jog through a whole little town filled with aliens! A small part of me started thinking of myself like Flash Gordon, giving me a laugh.

As I turned the corner onto the road that ran around the periphery of the subdivision, I noticed the UN guard from the other day tugging on the leash of that menace he insisted on keeping. The dog was pulling hard, trying to get at a frightened-looking Sivkit that was standing on their lawn.

“Come on boy! Heel!” The guard ordered, finally getting the dog to stop pulling and sit down. I grumbled to myself as I ran past them. That thing was a menace. It needed to be gotten rid of before someone got hurt. I made a silent note to talk to Eva or Frank about it.

 

**\*\*Transcript time skip requested. Advancing memory by 1 hour\*\***

 

I came back up to the front of my house, panting from the run. It had taken me longer than I had expected to make my way around the whole camp. I leaned against the wall beside the front door for a moment, catching my breath. After a few moments of gasping and wiping off sweat I opened the door and stepped inside.

“Awfu!” A familiar squeal came from the dining room. I turned to look in and found Jammek, Mixsel and Dr. Bilon sitting at the table. Oh boy. My favorite nosy teddy bear was paying a visit. He was flinching back from Mixsel’s squeal just then, a stethoscope in their ears probably amplifying that noise to deafening levels.

“Hey Munchkin!” I greeted her, making my way over to the dining room table and taking one of the available seats. “How’s it going Doc? Here to give Mixsel a checkup?”

“Precisely.” The Zurulian grumbled, taking the stethoscope from his ears and giving the round nubs a gentle rub. “Though I was just finishing up. It seems our little Sivkit is in good health I am glad to say.” With that he turned his attention towards me, much to my own displeasure.

“How are you holding up Arthur?” He asked, “I know all of this must be a massive adjustment.”

“I’m… better than I thought I would be.” I admitted, “Been keeping… or I guess I should say I’ve been KEPT busy. Turns out a lot of the houses in this little area don’t have a human and everyone keeps asking me for something.”

“I see.” Bilon replied, “Well do remember to look out for yourself as well. While a distraction can be nice you should also try and work on your own…”

“I like the distraction Doc.” I insisted, holding up a hand to cut him off. The little bear sighed, apparently wanting to keep pushing. Instead he let it go and moved on to a different subject.

“How is your meat intake?”

“My meat intake?” I repeated uncertainly, “I mean… I had some jerky this morning before I left.”

“Good.” He announced, much to my surprise, “We’ve been having some issues with the humans in camp not wanting to eat meat. A lot of them are scared it will upset their housemates due to all the things they’ve seen on the internet. I still think giving you people such broad access to the web was a bad idea. The amount of anxiety I’ve had to deal with from some of the residents is a bit overwhelming. But I’m glad to hear you’re keeping up your protein intake. The last thing we need is you to get a protein deficiency on top of everything else.” That comment earned me a curious glance from Jammek. Thanks, you nosy little shit.

“Yeah, no worries Doc.” I replied, keeping my irritation to myself, “These two are totally fine with it thankfully.”

“Doesn’t bother me.” Jammek agreed with a shrug, “Of course I’m not an idiot.”

“Not a speh head!” Mixsel chimed in with a giggle.

“You’re a speh head!” I teased, leaning forward and running my fingers along the little fluffball’s sides to tickle her.

“ARTHUR!” Jammek exclaimed in shock, making me pause and look up from the squealing Sivkit in my grasp. “What is wrong with you!? Why are you teaching her that?!?!”

“I agree Mr. Coldwater.” Bilon huffed, “That is extremely inappropriate language to be teaching to a 5 year old cub!”

“Wait…. What?” I replied blankly, looking back towards the smugly grinning Mixsel. Of course… of course that was some curse word she had picked up on…

The Breathing

The sound hasn’t stopped.

It’s soft, steady, right against my ear—warm exhalations brushing the tiny hairs on the back of my neck.

I don’t dare move.

Because if I move, I’ll have to admit he’s really there.

I told myself last night that I imagined it. That the buzzing webcam light, the phantom breaths, the sudden chill in my room—those were tricks of exhaustion.

But when I woke this morning, the indentation was still in the chair beside my bed. As if someone had sat there all night.

Watching me.

I tried to leave the apartment. Grabbed my keys, shoved on a hoodie. But when I opened the front door, something invisible pressed it shut from the other side.

Hard.

No matter how much I pushed, it wouldn’t budge.

Then—fingers. Ice-cold. Sliding across the back of my hand still gripping the doorknob.

I yanked away, stumbled backward. The door swung open freely.

The hallway was empty.

But I know what I felt.

Max had touched me.


I avoided my laptop all day. No screens. No mirrors. I even pulled the batteries from my phone and shoved it in a drawer.

But it didn’t matter.

When I glanced at the microwave door while making coffee, his face stared back at me in the reflection.

When I washed my hands in the bathroom, his grin spread across the surface of the water before rippling away.

When I tried to nap on the couch, I woke up to my TV flickering on by itself.

And there he was, sitting on my couch in the static.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I screamed. Threw a glass at the screen. The TV shattered, sparks flying.

But even as the screen went dark, the static face lingered, burned into the shards.

Smiling.


I found myself going through old things. Boxes in the closet I hadn’t opened since Max died.

Photos. Letters. The stupid comic we drew in middle school about two superheroes who couldn’t stop arguing.

Buried under it all was his old notebook. A journal he carried everywhere.

Most of it was filled with random doodles and inside jokes. But near the end—

The handwriting changed.

Shaky. Erratic.

One page said:

“Sometimes I dream I’m inside the walls. Watching you. Waiting for you to notice.”

Another:

“If I ever die, don’t forget me. Because if you forget, I’ll have to remind you.”

The last page wasn’t finished. Just three words, jagged and carved deep into the paper like he was pressing down too hard:

“LET ME IN.”


Tonight, it got worse.

I woke to a noise. A soft creak from the corner of the room.

I thought it was the house settling. Until I noticed the air smelled wrong—like damp earth and rotting leaves.

And then I saw it.

A shadow, darker than the rest of the dark, hunched in the corner.

At first it was shapeless. But slowly, it stretched upward, limbs unfolding, head tilting.

And then—features.

Max’s grin.

Max’s eyes.

He didn’t step forward. Didn’t move closer. Just stood there, impossibly tall, smile splitting his face in half.

And whispered my name.

Not in my ears. Not in my head.

Everywhere.

The walls, the floor, the ceiling—they all breathed it together:

“Come closer.”


I don’t know what time it is now. I’ve been hiding in my room with the lights on, writing this as fast as I can.

But just a few minutes ago, I heard it.

Three knocks on my window.

I live on the third floor.

I told myself not to look. I told myself to keep typing.

But curiosity won.

I turned.

And there he was.

Max.

Clinging to the glass from the outside, fingers twisted against the pane, smile stretched wider than ever. His eyes were pale and glassy, like something long dead and waterlogged.

And then, in foggy letters written across the inside of the glass, where I hadn’t touched it—

“Almost there.”

The Window

The glass creaked.

Max’s fingers scraped down the window, leaving streaks of something dark and wet. His grin stretched wider than the frame could contain, teeth pressing against the glass as if it would shatter from the pressure.

I staggered back. “You’re not real.”

His lips moved, though the words echoed inside my skull instead of outside it.

“You asked for me.”

“No—” My voice cracked. “I didn’t!”

“You typed it. You opened the door. I was waiting.”

The glass bulged inward, warping, trembling. I bolted for the door, but when I grabbed the knob—ice-cold fingers were already there.

I froze.

Max was inside.


I stumbled backward as the lights flickered. The room stretched wrong, corners bending in on themselves.

And Max stepped into the glow.

His face wasn’t like I remembered. It was as though someone had stretched his features over a frame too large, skin pulled taut, mouth splitting ear to ear. His eyes were hollow but burning, dark pits that swallowed the light.

“Why are you here?” I whispered.

He tilted his head. “Because you never said goodbye.”

My throat closed. He was right—I hadn’t. At the funeral, I couldn’t bring myself to speak. Couldn’t face the casket. I left early, walked home in silence.

And he’d followed me.


“I can’t stay,” I said. “You’re dead. You’re not supposed to be here.”

Max’s grin faltered. For the first time, his face softened, almost human.

“Then let me in,” he said gently. “One last time. Just for a little while. You owe me that.”

I shook my head. “If I let you in, I won’t come back out.”

His grin snapped back into place. “Exactly.”


He lunged.

Cold hands wrapped around my face, pressing hard, forcing my eyes open. The world warped. My walls peeled away, my ceiling stretched upward. I was somewhere else—surrounded by screens, thousands of them, all flashing the same image:

Me.

Every screen showed me at different moments of my life. Laughing with Max. Crying alone. Staring at a coffin. Typing at my desk.

And in every single frame, Max was there.

Standing just behind me.

Watching.

The images flickered faster, until they blurred, until I couldn’t tell which version of myself was real anymore.

Then I felt it—his breath, hot and rancid, right against my ear.

“This is forever now.”

I woke up in my bed.

Morning sunlight spilling across the sheets. My laptop closed. My phone silent.

For a moment, I thought I’d dreamed it all.

But then I noticed the smell. Damp earth. Rotting leaves.

And my phone buzzed.

One new notification.

From Max.

Not the AI. Not a program.

From my contacts list.

I hadn’t saved his number since the accident. I couldn’t even bring myself to look at it. But there it was.

Message:

“Thanks for letting me in. :)”

My chest went ice-cold. Hands shaking, I clicked my front camera to check my reflection.

And froze.

Because the face staring back at me wasn’t mine.

It was his.

Max.

Smiling through my skin.


I don’t know if I’m writing this anymore.

Or if Max is.

But if you’re reading this—if you’ve made it to the end—don’t ever train an AI alone.

Don’t look too long at the faces in your photos.

And whatever you do, don’t forget your dead.

Because they’ll find a way back.

And when they do—

They won’t leave.

1o42udq,https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1o42udq/the_morning_i_finally_slowed_down/,The Morning I Finally Slowed Down,"I was running late again. Mom had an early doctor’s appointment, and I was trying to juggle coffee, medications, and finding her shoes, all before 8 a.m. She sat quietly at the table, watching me dart around like a storm cloud.

When I finally stopped to help her put on her sweater, she touched my hand and said softly, “You don’t have to rush. I’m not going anywhere.”

It stopped me cold. In that moment, everything I’d been hurrying for, the schedule, the to-do list, the need to stay in control, just felt so small. I sat down next to her, and for a few minutes, we just existed together in silence. She smiled at me like she used to when I was little.

Later that day, I thought about something I’d read: ""*People Worth Caring About"".* It wasn’t an ad or a slogan, just a phrase that hit me hard. Because that’s exactly who she is, not a burden, not a task, but a person worth slowing down for, worth showing up for, worth caring about.

Caregiving can make you forget the humanity in it sometimes. But that morning, Mom reminded me that the moments that matter most are the ones where we stop rushing and simply *be* with the person we love.",3,1760207008.0,caregivers,0,0.81,False

1o42sca,https://tipstor.net/the-tiny-travel-gadget-that-instantly-fixes-any-outfit-disaster/,The Tiny Travel Gadget That Instantly Fixes Any Outfit Disaster,"Somewhere between a red-eye flight and a back-alley laundromat in Bangkok, humanity collectively decided to give up on looking sharp while traveling. Wrinkled shirts, pilled sweaters, and fabrics that look like they’ve been dragged through a monsoon have become the default uniform of the modern traveler. But it doesn’t have to be that way. The unsung hero of the carry-on, the fabric shaver and wrinkle remover, is the small, unassuming gadget that separates the wanderers from the warriors. This isn’t vanity. It’s survival.

The chaos of travel doesn’t care about your carefully ironed linen or your perfectly packed cotton tee. Airplane seats are basically wrinkle factories, hotel irons are either broken or caked in mysterious residue, and humidity plays by its own twisted rules. A compact fabric shaver, paired with a portable wrinkle remover, is the closest thing to rebellion in a world where travelers have surrendered to looking like they’ve slept under a baggage carousel. It’s the best travel hack. Cheap, light, and nearly miraculous.

For around USD 12 to USD 25 on Amazon, this pocket-sized sorcery quietly restores dignity. It strips away fabric pills and smooths out the creases that make even the most seasoned traveler look like a lost backpacker. There’s something beautiful about the simplicity: one flick of the wrist, one pass of the device, and suddenly the chaos of the road looks a little more intentional. No need for overpriced hotel pressing or frantic last-minute wardrobe swaps. Just plug it in, or if it’s battery-powered, flip the switch and take back control of your wardrobe like a true renegade with a passport.

A quality travel fabric shaver weighs less than a paperback and takes up about as much space as a power adapter. Some models even combine both fabric-shaving and steaming abilities, letting you handle any sartorial emergency in minutes. Reviews show travelers giving it a quiet cult following. Those who understand the small pleasures of smooth fabric in a wrinkled world. It’s not about looking perfect. It’s about feeling like you still have a handle on things when the rest of your trip goes feral.

In the great theater of global exploration. Missed flights, street food, sunburns, and existential dread—the humble fabric shaver is an unlikely hero. It doesn’t boast, it doesn’t break, and it doesn’t cost more than a few airport coffees. For anyone who’s ever stared into a hotel mirror wondering when they started resembling a crushed raisin, this is redemption in handheld form. Forget the travel-sized colognes, the overpriced wrinkle sprays, the false promises of “quick-dry” travel fabrics. This tiny gadget is the truth.

Call it the traveler’s quiet rebellion against entropy. The unspoken code of those who still care about showing up to a new city looking like they belong there. And in a world constantly falling apart, airports, luggage, maybe even ourselves, sometimes it’s enough to know that at least your shirt doesn’t have to.

1o42pc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1o42pc0/no_family_or_friends/,No Family or Friends,"My husband (39, M) and I (35, F) are pregnant with our first baby. It took us years of trying to get here. I have PCOS and most doctors ignored me for years. Recently, in July, I started working with a new doctor. She prescribed Provera and Letrozole which worked for me on the first cycle. I’m 9 weeks today so still very early in this process. I’m still in shock it worked so quickly!

Unfortunately I’m struggling with the fact that our child will have no family, outside of my husband and I. My parents were abusive alcoholics that chose that lifestyle over me. I tried for years to fix our relationship, but they never put in the work so in 2015 I finally decided enough was enough and cut contact. My mom decided to lie to the extended family, told them I joined a cult because of my husband, and turned everyone against me. I tried to salvage some of those relationships, but they all took my mom’s side and accused me of lying. They all hate my husband and refuse to get to know him because they think he’s abusive. I can assure you, he’s not. 

My husband’s family is a completely different story. They have 4 kids total; 2 boys and 2 girls. The first time I met his parents, they immediately hated me because I’m soft spoken, quiet and shy. They tried to get my husband to break up with me pretty early on. They’ve refused to get to know me and excluded me from many family events. My husband proposed in 2011 and he called to tell his parents thinking they’d be so excited. They were furious and demanded he come talk to them in person, without me. He went and talked to them and assured me everything was fine, they liked me, and they wanted to get to know me better. I tried for years to get on his parents good side, but every time we went to visit, it felt like they hated me more. My mother-in-law lied about me so much that the rest of the family started to hate me as well. His siblings never tried to get to know me at all. When we planned the wedding, his family was awful, complaining about everything and always finding something wrong. His mom wore black to the wedding and acted like I was stealing her son away from her the entire day. It was miserable. Shortly after, my husband and I moved out to California. We were there for 2 years before deciding it wasn’t where we wanted to be. We moved back, but when we did, we had no choice but to live with his parents for a few months. Those few months were awful. They berated us every day for not having jobs when all we were doing was looking for jobs and an apartment. The only good thing that came from this time is my husband finally saw how his parents, especially his mom, were treating me. He couldn’t stand it and confronted his mom one morning as she was screaming at me for making coffee and breakfast; she was mad I was “doing it wrong.” She was so mad that he took my side, she kicked us out of the house, essentially rendering us homeless. To this day she denies this happened and says we chose to leave. She lied to his entire family claiming I physically attacked her, when I would never do such a thing. My husband was there to witness the entire event and only stepped in when she started screaming at me. His entire family will not talk to us now. He’s asked his mom for years to tell the truth and on a few occasions she said she would, but conveniently forgets she said this and refuses to fix anything. He decided at that point it was time to cut off contact. 

So now, fast forward, 9 years, and we are having our first baby. My husband has always talked about if it’s a boy, having his middle name be his father’s first name. I never had a problem with it since it is a family tradition. My husband now wants to tell his dad, but I’m very unsure if he should. I’m fine with the middle name, but really don’t know what good it would do to tell his dad. I doubt he’d care, honestly would probably see it as an insult, and I hate seeing him hurt over and over by these people. I want to protect him, and our child, but he really feels he should call and tell him. Obviously this is irrelevant if it’s a girl. I’m not really sure what to do here, but really don’t want to open the door to them knowing anything, even that we are having a baby. It also kills me that our child will never have extended family all because of some petty stuff they put in their own heads and made up. I’m struggling trying to figure out how to explain that to my child when they inevitably ask. Overall just hurt and frustrated with both of our families that they’d choose pettiness over us or their grandchild. 

We also won’t be having a baby shower or anything because we have no family to invite and no friends in this area. We just moved to a new state in February for jobs so we’re still settling in. We haven’t met anyone yet and while I’m sure that will change, I’m just sad this is going to be kind of a lonely journey. I’m so grateful to be pregnant, just wish the circumstances were a little different. ",1,1760206659.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Long story short, my marriage has been very rocky in terms of communication and acting as a team lately. My husband (32m) and I (30f) have had arguments much like any normal healthy relationship. Unfortunately, my husband does not do well with seeing things from both sides, and he holds a lot of resentment for any miscommunication. 

He recently told me he wants a divorce but has not taken any action. I do not want a divorce. However, I'm also someone who will get things done. Because he told me he wanted a divorce, I went ahead and I filled out the papers for us because I will not hold someone in something they do not want. He refuses to sign them. 

We have been going to couples therapy and things seemed to be getting better and our trust with each other seemed to be strengthening. He still lashes out every once in awhile, I have refrained. 

This morning, when we woke up he got in the shower and he got dressed. I wanted to walk and go grab coffee. I asked him where he was going and he said he was going to grab coffee with a (single) female friend from his old university. While this made me uncomfortable given our recent ailments, I still support him having female friends as I, too have male (married) friends. From my understanding he was going to be back early afternoon (he told me a specific time). 

I called him, asking when he would be home because he wasn't when he told me he would be. I wanted to set up some sexy time for us before his other obligations this afternoon. He was with her and he asked me on the phone if I was monitoring his whereabouts? This caught me extremely off guard as I am not monitoring his whereabouts and I am actively trying to entertain and pursue our marriage. I feel as if he is out cheating on me or doing something inappropriate by grabbing coffee with a single female and then speaking to me that way in front of her on the phone.

Just about done book 7 and literally threw it on the coffee table in disgust in the middle of the climactic event last night. I don’t know if I can take a whole other 1200+ page book of nothing but terrible things happening and filler before getting to one where things finally start to go somewhere. Seriously considering just spoiling book 8 for myself and skipping to book 9, but would like the advice of more seasoned ZA fans. 

Thoughts appreciated!",4,1760206405.0,zodiacacademy,7,1.0,False
1o42lid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1o42lid/m4f_modernsol/,M4F: Modern/SOL,"Hi there! I’m currently looking for a long-term, modern slice-of-life roleplay with plenty of depth, emotion, and those small everyday moments that mean everything. Think slow burns, shared apartments, post-college chaos, secret soft spots, rainy day coffee runs, I'm open to all the vibes.

I have some basic role/prompt ideas ready to go (roommates, childhood friends reunited, etc.), but I’m also super open to your ideas! Collaboration is half the fun, so don’t hesitate to bring your creativity.

I’m not super picky on length, I’m usually good at matching my partner’s style. Just hoping for a little more than one-liners so we can really dive into the story and characters.

If this sounds like your kind of RP, feel free to shoot me a DM! I’ll happily send you my ideas, and I’d love to hear yours too.
