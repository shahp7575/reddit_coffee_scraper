We had a great first date that lasted over five hours, but it was very chaotic and rather funny. Afterwards, she said she didn't feel the date vibe, but she‚Äòd like to meet up as friends. Since then, we've been to the movies; she asked me if I wanted to join her on a concert and we went for coffee. I don't live in her city, but I'm there for work. That's why I asked of she wants to to for a drink again. First she said yes! But then got sick. The second time, I was out in her city and asked if she felt better and wants to meet. 
she seemed interested, but then she was already at home and tired. I told her that I seem to enjoy spending time with her via text and since then, nothing has happened.

she's not a big texter;, has been so from the beginning. She seems to be very busy and a confident type.  I'm rather anxious and now worried, because I like her. Also as a friend. 

Actually, I don't even know what kind of advice I'm looking for, because I can't change anything now anyway: it's just a shame because we got along really well. I'm a little afraid that I've scared her off; because I sometimes get a little sarcastic so as not to show her too much that I already like her.

1nzwzrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1nzwzrx/what_do_i_do/,What do I do?,"Hi! This is my first post ever so far. I needed some way to get some advice and opinions that aren‚Äôt biased since if I were to ask my friends about it, they‚Äôd immediately say I have a chance. But I just think they‚Äôre being sweet. üò≠

I have a big crush on this guy from my class and I‚Äôm planning to confess to him but that depends if I actually have a chance. I can‚Äôt possibly live down a rejection since we‚Äôre in the same class AND we sit next to each other üíî

So, I‚Äôll start listing things he does and maybe you guys can tell me what you think.

1. He carries my bags inside the classroom (not because he offers, I ask him. So it‚Äôs probably nothing big).
2. I have an issue with my ears that makes loud noises really painful. He offers me his noise cancelling headphones so I can be more comfortable which I think is super sweet of him.
3. There was this time where I had horrible period cramps in school and none of my family members could pick me up due to a busy schedule. He helped me with everything. He got me a hot compress from the clinic (which was located near the front gate, our building was in the back.) and he refilled it with hot water every time it got cold. He also got me medicine to help. He kept teasing me during it though, he kept imitating my whining and my position üò≠
4. His chair is always close to me. So much so that his elbow is on MY armrest. Our desk can hold three students and we sit with another girl with him in the middle and with me on the further side.
5. Related to the chair thing: he transferred to the girls seat since she was absent to get a better view of the blackboard. I joked and said, ‚Äúcome back,‚Äù and he did.
6. He loves drinking coffee so it results to him being a live wire in class, he gets super hyper and always play fights me or shakes my shoulder gently.
7. When I‚Äôm cold, he lets me have his jacket. I noticed he was cold but he never asked for it back. I gave it to him anyway because I felt bad.
8. He‚Äôs comfortable with me touching him. For example: I touch his back when I pass him, I pinch him when he acts out (which I think he does on purpose üò≠), I touched his hair when he had his head leaned on my chair, I also caress his back when I‚Äôm trying to wake him up. I‚Äôm just noticing how obvious I‚Äôve been towards him üíî
9. When I was crying because my ears hurt so bad, he put his hand behind my back to check on me, I looked up not knowing who it was. I must‚Äôve looked so stupid crying lol. But that‚Äôs when he started offering his headphones to me ( referring to 2)l

Reading those makes me feel pretty hopeful but let me list some of the bad(?) stuff.

1. We don‚Äôt text, at all. Not that I‚Äôd initiate anyway, I‚Äôm shy.
2. He‚Äôs just really nice, I‚Äôm not the only girl he teases.

Oh, uhm, that‚Äôs it. üò≠

Thank you for reading! Tell me what you guys think. Please be brutally honest, I don‚Äôt want to be delusional.

1nzwyu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nzwyu9/should_i_break_no_contact_after_more_then_5_months/,Should i break no contact after more then 5 months?,"This is going to be a longer text so i will give you a small summary at the beginning:

I (25 m) broke up with a girl (26 f) after 8 months of dating. I never had a relationship and other experiences before. I decided to break up because i felt like missing something out and got insecure about it. During no contact she sent me small signals that she is still interested. I started seeing someone new that i wont date for much longer and in the recent weeks i started to think a lot of my ex and started missing her. I realized that i was insecure about no experience and that I had commitment issues I am ready to get rid of now.

 Long story:

Main info in the beginning:
Me (m 25) dated a woman (26 f) for over 8 months. She was the very first girl i really dated and I got my first experiences with her (so l am a late bloomer). I am 6'2"" quite muscular and in general not bad looking. I simply never tried to get a gf before (traumatic experience when | was 17 and studies/job 1 used an an excuse). So i am confident to say that I could have had a gf before if I tried (and bc other girls showed interest but I was not interested and also bit scared tbh)

So to the main story:
I got introduced to this girl through a mutual friend that told me before that he wanted to set me up with his best female friend. She also knew about that. In general she is cute but not quite my type. She was a bit too skinny and short (5'4"") for me but bc | dont get much opportunities 1 was like lets try it, if it does not work out I can atleast collect more experience in dating/talking to woman.
Fast forward two months in we got along very good and it was really refreshing that she was honest with me and showed me that she was interested in me. She didnt play any games as l was used to. But I was still not falling for her and I realized there where some differences that would make it harder for us.
She does not eat meat at all (simply for the taste, she had no problem with me eating it), her surrounding and friends are the total opposite of mine (her surrounding is more modern/liberal meanwhile mine is more conservative/slavic), which in general was not a big problem because we are both from the same nationality (we live as ‚Äûforeigners"" in a different country), she had not much friends to go out with and stayed a lot at home meanwhile my circle was bigger and after finishing my studies at that time I had a lot of time to finally meet my friends more often and tried to catch up the time I couldnt meet them and she suffered of depression what made it harder for me bc I didnt know how to handle it.
Furthermore she asked me to make plans in a future that were further away then we dated esch other and demand too much commitment for me. For example she asked me to join her to a trip to france out of nowhere. I declined it. I think in general this were really nice things and in on hand it made me happy that she planned to be with me in the future but it also scared me alot so that I started to pull back.

The next problem was after the first times of sex. I somehow lost the excitment after that. Idk if it was be sex wasnt that special as I thought it was or that i ‚Äûreached my goal"". But i felt awful and guilty back then bc of that. With the problems before that it i really had a bad time and she also realized something was off but never really asked. But I decided to stay bc l thought this feeling will fade away and I still appreciate her a lot.
Fast forward 5 months in, we were still seeing eachother and we get along. Never had an argument but I realized that I was kinda losing interest and that I putted way less effort in then before. I am gonna be honest, i did no treat her as I should or as she deserved by not answering her texts sometimes/ignoring or not trying to see her as often ss I should. I regret this behaviour but I think this was a reaction from me hoping that maybe she will break things up. Another insecurity that appeared was that she had partners before. Which is very normal at that age but whenever she kinda mentioned it or when I thought about it that she did stuff with someone else meanwhile she was the only one for me made me feel uneasy. I didnt like this feeling so that the urge for me to also get more experience got bigger. I felt like i am missing out on something but I never cheated or even talked to someone! Just the urge for something new got stronger

Between 5-7 month the urge got less extreme. I had a change of mind for a short time thinking I should just be happy with her bc she is the sweetest person I knew thats treats me very nice and we get really good along. But some things started to get on my nerves. For example that everytime we cook together we had to make sure that there is no meat or that I feel guilty that I am meeting my friends on the weekend while she stayed at home bc she unfortunately had so friendgroup she could hang out regulary.
8 month time of the breakup. I realized this can not continue like that. I still felt like I needed to try something new. All small things got on my nerves like her nutrition or her complaing about work so I decided to break up. But boy, this was so hard for me. At the first attempt I couldnt. I got sick to my stomach. For real, my stomach hurt bc of that. And at the second attempt I almost did not do it but through another conversation I managed to say that but it was very weird and not how i expected it. I got very emotional eventhough until then I thought i wouldnt care to much. She even offered me instead of a break up to go an a break but i declined it because at that time i thought after a break up there is no going back. But i felt like that she kept a door open with saying if I want to talk again i can call her so we can grab a coffee but i should not wait too long before she loses feelings.

First week after the break up:

Immediately after the break up i felt relieved that I did it but not satisfied.
The first two days after that were very emotional. I didnt expect that. I teared up the whole time. Was very sad. It felt like i lost something very important. Like somebody died. No texts nothing. The silence was very loud. But somehow at the third day it was a lot better and then i started to forget it somehow.

3 weeks after the break up:

I was at a two weeks trip with my friends. I rarely thought about her and started to feel good. Until one morning when she sent me a instagram reel with tipps and recommendations for a city i will visit on my trip saying if i need some tips here you go. I said thank you and that i am still not at that place yet. She didnt answer. And that message from her triggered something in me. Since that message i couldnt stop thinking about her the whole trip. It kinda ruined it for me because i started to be kinda sad and in a bad mood bc i realized how it affected me. I even bought her some souvenirs and stuff i know she would appreciate knowing i probably will never gibe it to her (it is still in my room in a bag). Days before she also started liking my instagram stories of me and the trip what also got me thinking like ‚Äûdoes she still care? Is that a signal?‚Äú and with the message the overthinking got worse.

2 months after the break up:

I deactivated my instagram profile and just wanted my peace and it got way better. I was still thinking about her but way less. I even started to gain interest to meet new people bit there was still no one around. When I was on summer vacation with friends her birthday came up. I was overthinking a lot if i should congratulate her or not. Late at her birthday i decided that i will congratulate her. She answer with a happy emoji what i didnt expected but i didnt continue the conversation. I was still too unsure about it and i gaines the urge to meet new people.

3 months after the break up:

I was starting to forget her more and more. Sometime my heart dropped when she dropped a besutiful picture of hers or liked a story of mine but it affected me way less with time. And then it happened, i downloaded dating apps and met a girl there. She looked beautiful and interesting but she isnt from my nationality and she does not even speak my native language. So we had to communicate in english (english is not my native language neither the domestic language in my country). But it worked and i was open to get some new experience without looking for something too serious in the beginning.

Now 5-6months after the break up:

I am still seeing the girl from the dating app but i am starting to lose interest. Especially after the first times of sleeping with eachother. At the same time started to think more and more of my ex again. She continued liking my stories (not every) and recently she added me on snapchat what was kinda weird bc i dont use it much and i never added her before. So for me this was a signal like you can snap me if you want. Idk. I know that I will have to break up with the new girl bc this will lead to nothing serious and i dont want do lead her on. I feel like i had my new experience and inrealized it is nothing special. I am not too much interested anymore in something casual or whatever. Dont want to see someone i am not interested or isnt right for me. But now i feel like or realize that my ‚Äûex‚Äú was very compatible with me. But i dont know if i should text her. For the last two weeks i live like in a delusional world where I see her still in my life. I daydream of how we will do things together in the future. Go to places and so on. Since the break up i felt like that this is not over.  

Now my birthday is coming up soon and I know that I will wait for her birthday text. Like the last sign. And now i am thinking should I text her before that, should I wait for my birthday to see if she will text me or however if she texts me or not, not text her.

Was someone in a similar situation? What should I tell if I decide that i want to reach out?

I dont regret the break up because I know that it was necessary and that the problem would continue but now I am scared that I will regret not reaching out. I feel like i found a partner there with who i could easily spent my time with. For all the problems about nutrition, spending time together and so on i feel like that i am way more mature about and ready to find solutions and compromises for that. I know now that i was very insecure and had commitment issues. But i feel like i can get rid od that and that I could give her the attention and love she was seeking and deserves. She is still not my type but I see her with different eyes. Her character is so beautiful that this makes her way more attractive then any other girl for me.

I know it was a very long text but thank you for reading all that :) i wrote my heart out (and could have gone in more detail lol)

Rent is **$1244.00** / month. Resident on the first of the month pays the rent, so even if you move in mid-month I will cover December. I will cover the relet fee, subletter is required to pay a $50 application few. Leasing office requires a full application, including background and credit check.

Main highlights:

* walking distance from campus, next to the Silverball and across the corner from the Missouri Theatre
* on one of the 'penthouse' floors, so upgraded finishings, including TVs in both living room and bedroom
* furnished (bed, four drawer dresser, desk, desk chair, loveseat, coffee table+tv tray combo, TV stand in living room). The dresser splits into two sections, so can be stowed under the bed
* in unit washer and dryer
* dishwasher
* most utilities included (wifi, water, heat). Electricity is separate, has run \~$40-70 (varies by AC use, I personally run it high in the summer)
* Renter's insurance is required, the building offers it as a package with rent for an extra $14 a month
* high ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, great view of campus
* Parking is NOT included, but only a few blocks away from both city garages, and there is a bus stop on the corner

I also have a few items I was planning to put on Marketplace before I move (a shelf unit for the bathroom, a swivel desk chair, a fire stick for the TV), happy to discuss giving you first dibs on any of that.",1,1759788095.0,columbiamo,0,1.0,False

1nzwutj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1nzwutj/desperately_out_of_practice/,Desperately out of practice,"Ok so just like the title says, I am super out of practice and have not actively dated anyone in almost a full year, like not even coffee dates) so I need advice on an interaction.

I matched with a guy on Hinge, we chatted a bit, decent enough convo to exchange numbers. There's not a huge attraction there but he's interesting and knows how to hold a convo. We have almost completely opposite schedules so we were doing a lot of phone tag to settle on a time for a date.

Two things happen, he proposes a Friday night, and he asks for my IG to follow me. I of course see his page when he follows me and he doesn't quiteee match his Hinge pics. Like it's definitely the same person but unfortunately I found him more attractive from his Hinge profile. I considered cancelling but that felt really shallow (because he's not unattractive at all! Just not my type) and we already had good convo so whatever.

So I fucked up by not texting him back for a week. I genuinely had a week from hell, and already suck at texting, but I know that's still  no excuse and it was super rude and inconsiderate. I texted him Saturday apologizing for ghosting, and asking if he was still interested, and wanted to try to plan something else.

He responds with multiple texts about how he has standards, expectations for communication and transparency, was turned off by being ghosted and needs more effort than that. I responded to say that's totally fair and left it at that because he's totally entitled to his feelings and I figured he just wasn't interested anymore. But he continued to text me about how he just wants respect for his time and effort and needs to know if that is something I can reciprocate.

So where I need advice is like, I can respect his feelings but for ME PERSONALLY, this feels a little overkill and coming on just a touch too strong for someone I've only been texting here and there for two weeks and have not actually met in person yet. I also feel like this could just be a clash of priorities (because I would be a little miffed but genuinely would not be that bothered if I went a few days not hearing from a new hinge match) and that is totally valid and fine as well.

TL:DR: Ghosted a Hinge match for a week, was told I needed to provide more respect and effort. Valid reaction or not?",1,1759788040.0,dating,3,1.0,False
1nzwu17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nzwu17/should_im23_break_the_ice_or_let_herf20/,Should I[M23] break the ice or let her[F20],"We have known each other for 9 months now. We were assigned to the same group for a project. We are both Asians. I knew from the moment I met her that she was attracted to me. It was that obvious. I won't list how I knew because the post will get too long. 

We spent twelve weeks growing close. I asked her out for coffee she pulled the I have a boyfriend card, I pulled back and she spiraled. 

Part of the spiral led to her nearly ruining our group project but I carried it to the end and pretty much saved both of us from failing.

We were apart all summer and yeah we ended up in the same class again. I haven't talked to her since I asked her out but first class she again tried flirting with me and I kind of shut it down because while I'm interested still I was done playing stupid games.

I sent her a text owning my feelings for her, telling her there were no hard feelings but also making it clear I won't be wasting my time chasing. She pretty much knows she can talk to me, and that the door is open. The issue with her even now is that she pretends to ignore me, let's me get close and is clearly hoping I break the ice. 

I like her, but I am not here to reward her behaviour. She lied about having a boyfriend(a mutual friend confirmed it) and is still too much of a coward to own up to it. 

Right now it feels like she just expects me to reset things for her and when I don't do that and ignore her back she spirals even more, starts skipping classes and such

So I do want a relationship with her, maybe a hookup if she won't date but I can't start anything off with me having to always do the work. Yet at the same time I'm confident enough in myself to break the silence and allow us to move forward but I feel like it's rewarding her avoidance so idk what to do

Tldr; Girl lied to me about having a boyfriend last semester. We both like each other but she keeps expecting me to do all the work and break the ice again. Not sure if I should or shouldn't. ",2,1759787987.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1nzwszr,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nzwszr/more_than_meets_the_eye/,More Than Meets the Eye,"Clara had been on dating apps long enough to stop expecting much. Most matches fizzled after a few messages, and the rare ones that made it to a first date usually ended with polite goodbyes and empty promises to text. But Noelle felt different from the start.

Her profile had been short and playful: *‚ÄúProfessional daydreamer ‚òÅÔ∏è | Coffee > Everything ‚òï | Model sometimes üì∏.‚Äù* Nothing too flashy, but her smile was captivating ‚Äî confident and real. And their conversations? They *clicked*. No awkward small talk, no dead-end replies. They talked about their favorite books, their worst vacations, and what they‚Äôd do if they won the lottery. Clara found herself laughing at messages, checking her phone more than usual, waiting for the next notification from Noelle.

After a few days of nonstop texting and late-night voice notes, Clara did something she rarely did anymore: she said yes to a date.

‚ÄúSaturday afternoon? Coffee?‚Äù Noelle suggested.  
‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù Clara replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the one nervously drinking three cappuccinos before you arrive.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll make sure to arrive fashionably five minutes late,‚Äù Noelle teased back.

The caf√© they picked was small and warm, the kind of place with mismatched furniture and indie music playing just a little too loudly. Clara arrived early ‚Äî of course she did ‚Äî and grabbed a corner table with a good view of the door. Her heart was thumping harder than she wanted to admit.

*It‚Äôs just a coffee,* she told herself. *It‚Äôs not a big deal.*

She checked her phone for the hundredth time. No new messages. She adjusted her hair, glanced at the door again, and started scrolling through their chat to kill time. That was when she heard a voice.

‚ÄúClara?‚Äù

It was gentle, familiar. Clara looked up ‚Äî and then her breath caught.

Noelle was there. The same bright smile from her pictures, the same sharp eyes she‚Äôd seen in selfies. But she wasn‚Äôt standing. She was seated in a compact wheelchair ‚Äî and as she rolled closer, Clara‚Äôs eyes widened as the truth sank in.

Noelle had no arms or legs.

She moved with surprising ease, maneuvering the chair with subtle motions of her torso and head. Her sleeves and pant legs ended smoothly ‚Äî no prosthetics, nothing hidden. Just Noelle, exactly as she was.

For a moment, Clara forgot how to breathe.

‚ÄúSurprise?‚Äù Noelle said, smiling nervously. ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ probably not what you were expecting.‚Äù

Clara blinked, her thoughts racing.  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she admitted softly. ‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should‚Äôve told you,‚Äù Noelle said quickly. ‚ÄúI *usually* do. But I liked how we were talking, and I didn‚Äôt want this to be the first thing you knew about me.‚Äù

Clara felt her heartbeat settle. She gestured to the seat across from her. ‚ÄúPlease, sit ‚Äî I mean, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù She stopped herself and laughed nervously. ‚ÄúSorry. You *are* sitting.‚Äù

Noelle laughed too, the tension in her shoulders easing. ‚ÄúHappens all the time. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

They sat there for a few seconds, neither quite sure what to say. Finally, Clara broke the silence.  
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ no arms, no legs.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Noelle said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúLost them when I was eighteen. Car accident. Whole story, long recovery. But I‚Äôm here. Still me.‚Äù

Clara nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYou seem‚Ä¶ really okay with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù Noelle said. ‚ÄúIt took time. A lot of time. But this is me now. I live alone, I work, I travel, I model for inclusive fashion brands. I even make terrible lasagna. Life didn‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

Clara smiled at that. ‚ÄúTerrible lasagna is a crime, but I can forgive you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you. That means a lot,‚Äù Noelle said with mock seriousness.

The conversation flowed more naturally after that. They talked about everything ‚Äî the accident, the recovery, how Noelle learned to navigate the world differently. Clara asked questions, careful not to pry, and Noelle answered them all with openness and humor. She explained how she types with a stylus strapped to a headband, how she paints by holding a brush in her mouth, and how she refuses to use prosthetics because she prefers the body she has now.

At some point, Clara realized she had completely forgotten about her initial shock. They were laughing about childhood cartoons, swapping book recommendations, and arguing over which Pok√©mon starter was the best. It felt easy ‚Äî *real.*

Two hours passed before they noticed the caf√© was nearly empty.

‚ÄúI had a great time,‚Äù Noelle said as they lingered by the door. ‚ÄúI was worried you‚Äôd bolt.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought about it for, like, half a second,‚Äù Clara admitted with a grin. ‚ÄúBut then I realized I‚Äôd be missing out on someone pretty amazing.‚Äù

Noelle‚Äôs cheeks flushed slightly. ‚ÄúYou mean that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Clara said. ‚ÄúAnd I hope this isn‚Äôt the last time we do this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if you promise to give my lasagna another chance,‚Äù Noelle teased.

‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù Clara said, smiling as they exchanged goodbyes.

Later that night, lying in bed, Clara replayed the day in her head. The surprise had been real ‚Äî intense, even. But more powerful was the connection that hadn‚Äôt gone anywhere. Noelle wasn‚Äôt defined by what she didn‚Äôt have. She was confident, funny, resilient ‚Äî and more authentic than anyone Clara had met in years.

And as she drifted off to sleep, Clara smiled at the thought:

I have some questions for seasoned travelers. üòä,"I'm thinking of booking the QM2. I hate flying and I saw that the QM2 is heading to the UK around time I would normally fly. 

I'm not one bit interested in dressing up and being fancy. Could we just have a very casual cruise and not do the fancy dinners etc. I have questions for those seasoned travelers who have done this crossing.

1. How casual can you dress on the ship. I wear athletic wear mostly and my husband wears jeans. Would this be OK for the buffet?

2. Do we need a balcony? I'm totally ok with not having one. But is it better to have one to let some light in the room?

3. We are both vegetarians are there many veggie food choices? 

4. My final destination is Scotland what is the best way to get there from Southhampton?

5. I have read wifi can be really bad so is it worth buying? 

6. My husband loves his coffee I drink water and tea is it free or do we need to buy a package? 

7. Insurance where is the best place to get it? It won't let me buy it with Cunard because I'm in New York.

8. How to avoid norovirus? This is only thing putting my husband off somewhat. The people he knows who have cruised all had it. 

9. Are there any other costs other than tipping we should be aware of? 

10. Finally it's the December crossing will it be choppy? 

Thanks for reading it through to the end. I know it's a lot. I'm on the spectrum and very much detail oriented. It helps my anxiety for me to know everything upfront. 

I appreciate any or all answers you can give me. üòä

Don't fall victim to FOMO or feel as though you're going to be ""left behind"" if you don't keep up with what's going on. It's never that serious. Your mental health and personal enjoyment of the media you consume should be what's most important to you. If you aren't enjoying Zenless anymore, **take a break**, and perhaps come back once the game reignites that spark that got you to play in the first place.

**Personal yap below.**
Please remember that this is all my personal experience and opinion! üòÅ

Recently, for me personally, ZZZ has been giving me less of a reason to get on. The events are ass, although the poly is welcomed, and there's no real side content or anything to really do. Could be my own fault since I'm a day 1 player and have basically beat the game by maxxing the characters that I own and have gotten to a state where I can consistently beat the endgame, but I wish there was more to do. It has gotten to a point where I only see myself getting on every Friday to do whatever endgame that had reset. I have about 800 active battery because I've been drinking coffee but haven't been spending the battery.

Honestly, I was hoping for the 2.3 livestream to give me a reason to stay, so when they showed the upcoming characters I got excited, but then none of them resonated with me, besides Ye Shunguang. Yay, 2 more child-like characters in Zhao & Dialyn (I think that's her name), like we haven't had enough. And Banyue looks pretty interesting, but I'd rather if he were wearing pants, his proportions don't look right to me personally. Regarding Lucia and Yidhari, I was never a fan of their designs. I personally thought Lucia was ugly before the redesign and is still ugly after, but that's just me, and Yidhari looks a little better, still mid, but her gameplay looks sluggish to me. So the designs haven't been doing it for me.

So the game has no entertaining content to complete, no intriguing characters to look forward to, and now I have no reason to keep playing. So I will take a break until the game captures my interest again. No use playing a game when you have nothing to look forward to. But I will return once the devs capture my interests again.

So what can they do to bring me and some players back? I've compiled a list of ideas, not really unique and these are pretty subjective but I know a lot of people, me included, would want these:

1. Stop making child-like characters for a bit.
We've had 5 in a row (Ju Fufu, Yuzuha, Alice, Seed, Orphie). It gets to a point. And after Lucia and Yidhari we're expecting a lot more in the future! I'm not looking forward to it. It puts ZZZ players in a weird light especially when ZZZ is considered a ""gooner game"" and then for 5 banners in a row we've had characters that could be mistaken for children. I don't care that they're not actually children, it's still weird. 

2. Make more unique characters.
I'm talking full thirens like Ben, Pan, Lycaon, Pulchra or even Onis like Soukaku, and not ""pale woman, sometimes with an animal part."" More men would be cool, too. Robots, too. Like I said, Banyue looks pretty interesting. Pretty cool. They need to make more of that so that people that like those types of characters can sort their options in case they're like me and aren't of fan of Banyue's design specifically. Seeing the same thing over and over again gets boring. Spice it up.

3. More buffs to MORE units.
Obviously they're going to buff older units, but it seems right now that the ""buffs"" are just kit fixes with some extra mechanics placed on. Ellen and Anby were in need of some adjustments due to how clunky they were, but every other 1.X agent seems pretty fine kit wise so they'll likely won't be buffed, at least for a long time. What if Zhu Yuan doesn't get buffed because she's ""functionally fine"", even though her damage is beginning to lack. Characters of the Defense specialty need drastic reworks to fit well into the game's gameplay. Buffing more units will prevent people from feeling like their favorites are being abandoned, and will definitely get some people to come back into the game (Zhu Yuan, Jane, Ben, Anton, Corin, Caesar, Burnice, Harumasa, etc).

4. Add back TV mode.
Yeah, I said it. But not within the main story. I'm talking commissions that you can pick up on Interknot like how you used to back in the day. I miss the Exploration, Combat and Rally commissions. It would also give people something to use the Fairy passes for (or whatever they're called) if they didn't want to do them.

5. More Developer Discussions.
Seeing the devs talk about their vision for the game or what the game has in store for the players gives people something to look forward to. They made a video talking about the development of Yuzuha and Alice, and then stopped. They'll likely make another one, but it's been a while now. I liked listening to the devs actually communicate with the playerbase instead of leaving all information to the pre-recorded Special Programs. Did you know the official ZZZ account likes comments? Stuff like that makes you feel seen and gives people something to look forward to.

6. More QOL.
Disk loadouts, substat reroller or selector, guaranteed weapon banner, better navigation, more ways to spend time with our agents (I want to take our relationship to the next level iykwim), just to name a few. 

And that's it for me. Personally, the main thing that would get me to come back is if they release a new unique character, because this is a gacha game after all and the characters are the selling point. I want to know what would you guys suggest the devs add to keep players and bring players back?  ",0,1759787773.0,ZZZ_Discussion,4,0.48,False
1nzwqqz,https://i.redd.it/tqomx051cktf1.jpeg,üåø The 5 Most Beautiful Villages in Mallorca (and Why You Should Visit Them),"If you think Mallorca is all beaches and party resorts ‚Äî think again.  
Behind the coastlines and the clubs, this island hides some of the most beautiful¬†*villages*¬†in the Mediterranean: quiet stone streets, mountain views, olive terraces, and caf√©s that feel frozen in time. Here are five that show the real soul of the island.

# 1.¬†Valldemossa

A classic mountain village that feels like a movie set ‚Äî honey-colored houses, flower-lined streets, and a soft mountain breeze that smells like pine.  
It‚Äôs famous for the monastery where Chopin and George Sand spent a winter in 1838, but what really makes Valldemossa special is its peace after sunset. Grab a¬†*coca de patata*¬†(sweet potato pastry), wander through the cobbled alleys, and watch the light fade over the valley.

**Vibe:**¬†Peaceful, poetic, timeless.

# 2.¬†Dei√†

Perched between mountains and sea, Dei√† has been a magnet for artists and dreamers for decades. Poet Robert Graves lived here, and the bohemian spirit never left.  
It‚Äôs small, arty, and full of terraces with sea views. Walk down to Cala Dei√† for a swim in the cove, then have lunch by the water. Sunset here is pure gold.

**Vibe:**¬†Artistic, romantic, a little luxurious.

# 3.¬†Fornalutx

Hidden in the S√≥ller valley, Fornalutx is all about stone staircases, orange trees, and mountain air. It‚Äôs been called ‚Äúthe prettiest village in Spain,‚Äù and honestly, that‚Äôs not an exaggeration.  
The best thing to do here? Wander without a plan. Stop for a coffee under citrus trees, listen to church bells, and take way too many photos.

**Vibe:**¬†Authentic, slow-paced, photogenic.

# 4.¬†Pollen√ßa

Bigger and livelier than the others, but still with tons of charm. The main square is perfect for people-watching, and the climb up the 365 Calvari steps gives you one of the best views on the island.  
Down the road, Port de Pollen√ßa adds beaches, seafood, and a laid-back coastal mood. Great if you want culture¬†*and*¬†the sea.

**Vibe:**¬†Cultural, sunny, balanced.

# 5.¬†Banyalbufar

Maybe the quietest of them all. The whole village is built on terraced hills that drop toward the sea, surrounded by vineyards and olive groves.  
Walk the old paths, visit the watchtower Torre del Verger, and just¬†*sit*. At sunset, the light over the terraces turns everything gold. It‚Äôs the perfect ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù spot.

**Vibe:**¬†Peaceful, rustic, cinematic.

# üó∫Ô∏è Bonus tip

If you rent a car, you can see all five villages in a week with plenty of time to relax. The mountain roads (especially the MA-10) are winding but absolutely stunning ‚Äî every turn feels like a painting. Check out [marsoleil.com](http://marsoleil.com) for all-inclusive car rental deals. Note: it's not the cheapest option, but if you want to rent a car with full insurance, unlimited mileage, taxes, and often reimbursement of the deductible: this is the way to go.

# üåû Why they matter

Mallorca‚Äôs beauty isn‚Äôt just in its beaches ‚Äî it‚Äôs in the quiet rhythm of these small places. 

When you walk through them slowly, you start to hear the heartbeat of the island: the sound of church bells, the smell of oranges, the sea breeze moving through narrow alleys.

If you go, don‚Äôt rush. Stay a night or two in one of these villages, watch the light change, and let Mallorca show you its quieter, older soul.",1,1759787760.0,roadtripineurope,0,1.0,False

Discovering another dead body in the middle of the case was frustrating. From a morality standpoint, it represented another unnecessary loss of life. It demonstrated that the first act couldn‚Äôt be written off as an abnormality. It reminded people that violence was a constant in the background. Additionally, it made the case more complicated.

Derrick and Becca didn‚Äôt possess crime lab equipment to scan for DNA and fingerprints. The science of criminology declined after the apocalypse. The techniques and equipment could be remade. The people with the means to do so were unwilling to commit to a revival. They had too many murders and crimes of their own that they wish to remain unsolved. Lastly, Derrick and Becca‚Äôs methods were haphazard and improvised. It was a miracle they had survived this long.

With their acquired expertise, they began to investigate thoroughly. Derrick went through the house searching for any evidence. Becca inspected Alyssa‚Äôs body closely. 

‚ÄúNo signs of forced entry,‚Äù Derrick said.

‚ÄúDid you check upstairs or the basement?‚Äù Becca replied.

‚ÄúThis house doesn‚Äôt have one, and do you really think that someone came in through the upstairs?‚Äù Derrick asked. Becca gave a disapproving look. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll go upstairs.‚Äù

Becca continued to inspect the body. She moved the limbs to see if rigor mortis had arrived. She also grabbed a nearby pencil and moved it along the body. Derrick came back downstairs holding another picture.

‚ÄúThere was no sign of forced entry upstairs and look what I found.‚Äù Derrick held the evidence by Becca who looked at it confused. The picture showed Alyssa with Veronica. 

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt mention knowing the victim when we arrived,‚Äù Becca said.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt say anything about herself.‚Äù Derrick set the picture down and hit his forehead. ‚ÄúAnd we left her alone. She could be destroying evidence or plotting a trap for us. These military types are always offing each other for a promotion. It makes sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe but we don‚Äôt know yet. Let‚Äôs give her the benefit of the doubt,‚Äù Becca said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be sure to watch my back though. Did you find anything?‚Äù Derrick asked.

‚ÄúNothing else. She died within the past hour I‚Äôd say. There was no sign of a struggle, no skin or fabric under her nails, and no wounds. There are three stab wounds in the chest. So she had to have seen the assailant,‚Äù Becca said.

‚ÄúCould we be dealing with multiple murders?‚Äù Derrick asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. The wounds are about the same depth. Unless it was multiple people of extremely equal strength,‚Äù Becca said. 

‚ÄúSo in other words a ghost killed her too.‚Äù Derrick turned around and looked at the coffee table. He tilted his head for a few moments. He bent over and reached under the table. A blue glove with the index finger missing lay under it. He walked over to the body and compared it to Alyssa‚Äôs hand. The glove was several sizes too large.  ‚ÄúBelong to the killer?‚Äù

‚ÄúPossibly, it could‚Äôve been left there from another time,‚Äù Becca said.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs all we got.‚Äù Derrick shoved the glove in his pocket. ‚ÄúSo what do you say we return to Veronica and give her a talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, but I am sure she‚Äôll have a logical explanation for it,‚Äù Becca replied.

---

A sign that someone was either busy or trying to look busy is to spread papers across the table. A disorganized workspace was the sign of genius not an improper filing system. They didn‚Äôt have the time to file papers away. If important documents or information was lost, so be it.

Veronica internalized this ideal. General Lavigne had an office in the north wing for official usage, and she promptly claimed it as her own. All of his personal items and artifacts were removed and replaced by hers. Forms unrelated to the task at hand were tossed on the floor, and she sat there writing away when Derrick and Becca knocked on her door. 

‚ÄúAh, come in. Did you find out anything useful?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúWell, Richard was really broken up over finding the body, and Mark had a list of complaints. Neither provided much though,‚Äù Becca replied.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too bad. I think I set the General‚Äôs planning book around here somewhere. You could see who else he met with.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was a third person that we interviewed,‚Äù Becca said. Veronica looked up at them.

‚ÄúI must‚Äôve interrupted you. Who was the third person?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlyssa Park,‚Äù Derrick said. Becca and Derrick waited for Veronica to respond. Instead, she looked at them both carefully.

‚ÄúAnd what did Alyssa say?‚Äù Veronica asked.

‚ÄúNothing, she‚Äôs dead,‚Äù Derrick said. Veronica tilted her head back and grabbed her chest. At this moment, her acting abilities reached their limit. Both Becca and Derrick knew this was an exaggeration.

‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve led with that. Two murders in so little time. That‚Äôs horrible,‚Äù Veronica said.

‚ÄúI agree. We didn‚Äôt find much at her crime scene either. It‚Äôs like we have a ghost on our hands,‚Äù Derrick said. Becca snapped a look at him. She was uncomfortable with lying, but she knew this was necessary.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs terrifying to think about. Did you tell anyone else?‚Äù Veronica asked.

‚ÄúWe saw her last, and we don‚Äôt know anyone else in town.‚Äù Becca‚Äôs words came out fast for her due to nerves. Derrick realized this and stepped in.

‚ÄúWould you know where we could find information about Alyssa‚Äôs next of kin to inform them about the tragedy?‚Äù Derrick asked. 

‚ÄúNo sorry I can‚Äôt help you there. Maybe you should ask around,‚Äù Veronica said.

‚ÄúDo you have a good starting point for us?‚Äù Becca asked. Veronica tilted her head.

‚ÄúNo, you two are the investigators,‚Äù Veronica said.

‚ÄúWell, you did say you were from here, right?‚Äù Becca‚Äôs voice broke on the last word, and Derrick could barely hide his embarrassment.

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think I ever said that. My aunt lived near here.‚Äù Veronica paused for a moment. ‚ÄúWell, I am from Dave, but this region is so large.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy mistake,‚Äù Becca smiled. The three stood in silence for several seconds. Derrick was the first to leave.

‚ÄúRight, we‚Äôll look to see if Alyssa had parents nearby. Let us know if you find anything,‚Äù Derrick said.

‚ÄúWill do,‚Äù Veronica said. Derrick and Becca hurried out of the manor and looked at each other.

‚ÄúSo she‚Äôs lying for sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she killed both of them,‚Äù Becca said.

‚ÄúI agree. I was looking at her hands. They are way too small for this glove. She‚Äôs still lying to us, and I don‚Äôt like that all our leads went nowhere,‚Äù Derrick said. Becca scratched her chin.

‚ÄúOne thing that Veronica said at the start was that the mayor was to be immediately eliminated as a suspect even though he lost city hall to General Lavigne.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think she was covering for him?‚Äù Derrick asked.

‚ÄúI am saying that it‚Äôs a new lead,‚Äù Becca said.

‚ÄúWell, better than anything I‚Äôve got,‚Äù Derrick replied.

Is she gaslighting me? If so, what can I do about it.","I'll try to give as much context and background as I can to help you get the best picture of what's going on, unbiased.

I am 36 and my partner is 29. We have been together about 10 years now. Although not married, we have 2 children together, ages 2 and 4. My partner works full time as I have chosen to be the stay at home parent. We live in an apartment next door to my father, who also happens to be our landlord.

My partner's place of work is literally only a 7 minute ride from our house, and if she wants to stop for a coffee before work, it probably takes 15 minutes total, as the coffee shop is next door to her work. 

Past few months, it seems like she needs to leave for work an hour early. Or maybe she randomly got asked to close, even tho she's only on the schedule til say, 7pm instead of 9. Or shell be the schedule til 9 and wont come home til 10 or 11. and every single time there's some crazy excuse. If it's in the morning, it's cause she's opening and has to get all the packages at the door. If it's at night, it's cause she left work and her friend was sitting in her car crying. Or she had to spend an hour on the phone with the bank cause her card didn't work at the pump. Almost every time she comes home, there's a 'you wont believe what happened!' story.

Now when we first had kids, I was working full time. I would finish my shift and FLY home as quickly as possible to spend time with the kids before it got dark or before they went to bed. Obviously I enjoy my children, but I also did it because I would think, 'she's been home with the kids all day, she probably needs a break!' But now that the roles are reversed, I'm 99% sure she's living with the attitude of 'I worked all day, therefore I'm free from any other responsibilities the rest of the day'. So basically I don't get relief when she gets home. 

We currently only have 1 car, that she drives to work obviously. So that leaves me  with just the stroller and the bicycle trailer. When I need something like milk or diapers, I usually have to have her pick it up on her way home from work as there's not much time to do errands as she works crazy hours. 

So here's the current situation I'm in.. It's Monday morning and we have playgroup with the kids at 12. My partner has to be at work at 12. We usually just ride the bike the 6 miles and it isn't an issue. However, this particular day, I was feeling a bit groggy and wanted some Dayquil. We were also out of waters, which is something essential I'd like to have while going on a 6 mile bike ride towing 80 pounds behind me on a 75 degree day. My partner said, ""They called me in to work early today, but I want to get that stuff for you. I'll try to be back before you have to leave'. We only live 2 streets over from CVS and the gas station. It shouldn't take long at all. Over an hour went by and she wasn't home and we had to leave, so we got on the bike and I started going to playgroup.

My partner called me on my way there and said, 'Hey I'm at CVS now, What kind of medicine did you want again??' and I got mad right away and said angrily and confused, ""You're JUST getting to CVS now??' She said, ""Yea I decided to go to the dollar store too to get some Halloween stuff"" I said, ""I feel like you're lying to me and you probably drove one of your friends to work."" That's when she got REALLY mad and started yelling at me about making random stuff up and how I should have just got the medicine myself and sorry she's such an idiot for forgetting' and then she hung up on me.

I texted her immediately telling her blah blah blah I don't think you're stupid. I thought you had to be to work early so I'm surprised you went shopping like that. and how I just feel frustrated I didn't get the waters or medicine. And she texted me back this big long giant paragraph rant about how ""Now I'm supposedly a LIAR and stupid cause you think I'm driving people to work??Random accusation while I'm out doing things for you guys!""

I went thru her phone that night when she fell asleep and saw a text to a friend she works with from that same morning that said and I quote, "":( I'll tell (me) I'm gonna go get him waters before work and I'll come bring you laugh/cry emoji"" They were talking about going to work and how he was going to take an Uber and she said she'd drive him instead.

This is a clear case of gaslighting right? I'm not reading this whole thing wrong am I? The kid she was texting is gay, so I don't think it's a cheating situation. I think she doesn't like being home, maybe? Does she like her friends more than her family? I don't get it. Why is driving a friend around more important to her than your family? Are they doing drugs together? Maybe she's got permanent post partum....is that even a thing?

I am afraid to call her out on this because I have caught her lying before and it always turns into her saying, ""OH now YOU wanna play the victim? Why don't you just break up with me if you hate me so much!"" And that's the kind of fight/argument I can't win. There's no right answer. PLUS, I don't want to admit I was going thru her phone cause then I lose that trust, and that source of information. I seriously don't even know what to do. I DO feel like a victim. I feel isolated and trapped. I don't want to break up with her AT ALL. I just want things to be OK and for the lying to stop. I want her to want to be home with her family. That's not too much to ask for, right? How do you deal with an un medicated person who potentially has bipolar and/or depression? ",0,1759787174.0,relationship_advice,16,0.4,False

I'm writing this because I need someone to tell me they remember the world the way I do. I need proof that I'm not losing my mind, or if I am, I need a record of what I was before this happened.

Three weeks ago, I lost my job. Budget cuts at a marketing firm that was already circling the drain. Two weeks ago, Jennifer left. We'd been together for four years, living together for two. She said all the right things about it not being my fault, but I know the truth. I'd become someone who spent every evening on the couch, scrolling through my phone, talking about how things used to be better. She wanted someone with a future, and I was too busy living in the past.

My back hurts constantly now. Thirty-six years old, and I wake up every morning feeling like I'm sixty. I can't afford a chiropractor anymore. I can't afford much of anything anymore.

This isn't how I imagined being a grown-up was going to be.

The nostalgia started as a comfort thing. When you can't sleep and your brain won't stop cataloging all the ways you've failed, it helps to watch old Nickelodeon commercials or read about discontinued snack foods. I know it's unhealthy. I know I'm using it as an escape. But it's the only thing that quiets my mind anymore.

YouTube's algorithm has learned exactly what I want. Obscure toy commercials from 1994. Forgotten Saturday morning cartoon blocks. Local station IDs from regional networks that don't exist anymore. There's a whole community of us, people who archive this stuff. The comments sections are full of people saying, ""I thought I was the only one who remembered this."" It feels like home in a way my actual apartment doesn't.

Three nights ago, I couldn't sleep. My back was killing me, and my brain was doing that thing where it replays every conversation you've ever had and points out all the ways you sounded stupid. I opened YouTube around 11 PM, thinking I'd watch a few videos and drift off.

Six hours later, I was still awake.

I'd started with the usual stuff. A compilation of '90s fast food commercials. A rip of an old Cartoon Network marathon bumper. Each video led to another, the recommendations getting more and more specific, more obscure.

Around 3 AM, I found a channel dedicated entirely to regional grocery store commercials from the mid-90s. The production values were terrible, the acting was painful, but I watched every single one. These tiny capsules of a world that didn't exist anymore, preserved by someone who cared enough to digitize them.

By 5 AM, I'd moved on to obscure public-access children's shows. The video quality was degrading. More VHS artifacts, more tracking errors, more of that analog warmth that felt like being wrapped in a blanket.

I should have stopped. I had a phone interview at noon, and I hadn't prepared. I needed sleep. My eyes were burning, and my back was screaming from being in the same position for so long.

I didn't want to stop.

The real world was waiting for me when I closed the laptop. The stack of bills on my desk. The job search spreadsheet with its growing list of rejections. The empty side of the bed. All of it sitting there in the dark, patient and inevitable.

At 5:47 AM, I clicked on a video titled ""Forgotten 90s Snack Commercials You Totally Forgot About."" Forty-three minutes long. Uploaded by a channel with 300 subscribers. The description was minimal: ""VHS rip from a 1996 recording. Some tracking issues, but mostly clean.""

I hit play.

The first few commercials were exactly what I expected. Dunkaroos with their cartoon kangaroo. Gushers with kids' heads transforming into fruit. I remembered all of them.

Then, at the 31-minute mark, something appeared that I didn't recognize.

The commercial opened in an aggressively cheerful kitchen. Cheap animation, even by 90s standards. A cartoon family with those weird oval heads and stick limbs. The color palette was oversaturated, everything too bright and flat. The mom had an apron and an impossible smile. The dad was reading a newspaper at a kitchen table that looked more like a cardboard cutout than furniture..

The mom sets a tray of cookies on the table. They were enormous, covered in exaggerated chocolate chips that sparkled and literally winked at the camera.

A voice-over began: ""When you want a treat that's sweet and neat, reach for Crumbly Cookies!""

The cartoon kid at the table grabbed one of the cookies. His eyes grew to twice their normal size. He bit into it, and the chocolate chips exploded into stars.

Then the music swelled. The animation zoomed in on the cookie. The mom, dad, and kid all opened their mouths in unison, clearly about to deliver the jingle.

And I heard nothing.

It wasn't silence. The audio didn't cut out completely. There was sound, but it was compressed, distorted. Like someone had taken that section of the audio file and replaced it with white noise, with static, with the sound of a corrupted file trying to play. Maybe a few seconds of garbled nothing where the jingle should have been.

Then the commercial resumed. ""Crumbly Cookies! Available at grocery stores everywhere!"" The family was back to smiling, and then it cut to the next commercial.

I sat there staring at the screen. My first thought was that the VHS rip was damaged. These old recordings always had issues.

I scrolled down to the comments.

The top comment, posted three months ago, had 847 likes: ""CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE! This jingle lives in my head rent-free 24/7. I'm 34 and I still can't get it out.""

I read it twice. Then I read the second comment.

""My mom used to sing this to annoy us on road trips. Thanks for unlocking that memory lol.""

The third comment: ""This jingle is literally the reason I became a jingle writer. No joke. It's perfectly constructed. That key change in the middle? Chef's kiss.""

Fourth comment: ""Anyone else hear this in their nightmares? It's been 30 years, and I can still hear every note.""

I scrolled through dozens more. People quoting the jingle. People sharing detailed memories of where they were when they first heard it. Someone had written a full paragraph analyzing the musical composition.

Not one person mentioned corrupted audio. Not one person said the jingle was missing or damaged.

They were all hearing something I wasn't.

I clicked back to the video and replayed the commercial. Same result. The setup was fine, the voice-over was clear, and then that static gap where the jingle should have been.

I opened a new tab and searched ""Crumbly Cookie jingle.""

Six different YouTube videos came up, all of them just the jingle itself, cleanly extracted from the commercial. ""Crumbly Cookie Jingle (1996) - Clean Audio,"" ""Crumbly Cookie Song - Full Version,"" ""Crumbly Cookie Jingle - 10 Hour Loop.""

I clicked the first one. The video was just a still image of the cookie from the commercial. The audio began. I heard the music start, that swelling buildup, and then the same compressed static gap, then silence.

The comments section had over two thousand comments. All of them talking about how catchy the jingle was. How memorable. How it had defined their childhood.

I checked Spotify. Someone had uploaded ""Retro Commercial Jingles - 90s Edition,"" and track seven was the Crumbly Cookie jingle. I played it through my headphones. Static gap. I played it through my laptop speakers. Static gap. I grabbed my phone and played it through that. Same thing.

I tried different browsers. I tried a VPN. I tried playing the videos at different speeds.

Every single time: buildup, static, outro.

It was 6:30 AM. The sun was starting to come up outside my window.

I told myself it was some kind of internet joke. A collective bit where everyone pretended to remember something that didn't exist.

I closed my laptop and tried to sleep.

At noon, I bombed the phone interview. I couldn't focus. I kept thinking about the static gap, about all those comments, about the certainty in people's comments when they talked about a jingle I couldn't hear.

At 2 PM, I texted Derek and asked if he wanted to grab coffee.

Derek and I have been friends since high school. We have this routine where we send each other the dumbest, most obscure nostalgic garbage we can find online. Weird local commercials, forgotten toy lines, and discontinued snack foods. He's the only person I know who understands the appeal.

We met at the coffee shop on Fifth Street at 3 PM. He was already there, scrolling through his phone. He looked up when I walked in and immediately frowned.

""You look like hell,"" he said.

""Couldn't sleep."" I sat down across from him. ""Hey, do you remember Crumbly Cookies? Like, the snack brand from the 90s?""

His face lit up immediately. ""Oh man, yeah! My grandma used to keep them in her pantry. They were pretty mediocre, honestly, but that jingle..."" He started nodding his head to some internal rhythm, smiling. ""Dude, you just put that back in my head. I'm going to be humming it all day now.""

My stomach dropped.

""Can you hum it for me?"" I asked.

He looked at me like I'd asked him to explain basic arithmetic. ""You're kidding, right? You don't remember the Crumbly Cookie song?""

""I remember the commercial,"" I said. ""I just can't remember the jingle part.""

""How do you remember the commercial but not the jingle? The jingle is the whole point.""

""I'm serious. I watched the commercial this morning. The audio cuts out right where the jingle should be.""

Derek stared at me for a long moment. Then he laughed, but it was an uncomfortable laugh. ""That's a weird bit, man.""

""It's not a bit.""

""Then you need to get some sleep. The Crumbly Cookie jingle is like... it's foundational. Everyone knows it."" He picked up his coffee and took a sip, still watching me with that confused expression. ""Are you feeling okay? Like, actually?""

I tried to laugh it off. ""Yeah, just tired. Forget I asked.""

We talked about other things for another twenty minutes, but the conversation felt strained. When we left, Derek gave me this look, concerned and bewildered, and told me to get some rest.

I walked home slowly. My back was killing me.

When I passed the corner of Fifth and Maple, I stopped.

There was a bakery there. A small storefront with a cheerful sign and a painted window.

I'd walked past that corner three times a week for the past two years.

It used to be a dry cleaner.

The sign read ""Cookie Crumble Cafe"" in that same aggressively cheerful font from the commercial. The mascot painted on the window was a cartoon cookie with a smiling face and oversized chocolate chips that sparkled. The color palette was identical.

I stood on the sidewalk for maybe ten minutes, just staring. The building looked old. Genuinely weathered. The paint on the window was faded in places, chipped at the edges. There was a historical business registry plaque near the door.

I walked closer and read it.

""Cookie Crumble Cafe. Est. 1997.""

Twenty-eight years. According to this plaque, this bakery had been here for twenty-eight years.

I knew what I'd see if I went inside. I knew I should just keep walking, go home, take some ibuprofen for my back, and try to sleep. But I couldn't make myself leave.

The bell above the door chimed when I pushed it open. The interior matched the exterior perfectly. Bright, cheerful, slightly dated. The display case was full of oversized cookies with exaggerated chocolate chips. The walls were painted that same yellow-orange.

A woman in her fifties stood behind the register. She smiled when she saw me.

""First time here?"" she asked.

""When did this place open?"" The question came out more aggressively than I intended.

She didn't seem bothered. ""Oh, we've been here forever. Twenty-eight years this November. My mom opened it right after those Crumbly Cookie commercials got big, shame the company went out of business. She loved that jingle so much that she decided to build a whole store around it. I thought she was crazy, but it worked out.""

""What was here before?"" I asked.

She looked confused. ""Before? Nothing. This was an empty lot. My mom bought the property and built it from the ground up.""

""There wasn't a dry cleaner here?""

""Not that I know of. Maybe you're thinking of a different corner?""

I left without buying anything.

When I got back to my apartment, I went straight to my laptop. I pulled up Google Maps and searched for the corner of Fifth and Maple. The street view loaded. I clicked back through the historical imagery.

2023: Cookie Crumble Cafe, awning slightly less faded.

2021: Cookie Crumble Cafe, same building.

2019: Cookie Crumble Cafe.

I went back as far as the imagery went. 2012. The oldest available photo. Cookie Crumble Cafe. The building looked newer, the paint brighter, but it was definitely there.

I sat back from my laptop and pressed my palms against my eyes. Maybe I'd been mistaken about the dry cleaner. Maybe it had been on a different corner.

I knew I wasn't mistaken.

I opened YouTube again and searched for the Crumbly Cookie commercial. I clicked on a video essay someone had made about 90s advertising trends. At the fifteen-minute mark, the creator started discussing the cultural impact of the Crumbly Cookie jingle.

""This is one of those rare cases where a commercial jingle transcended advertising and became a genuine cultural touchstone,"" the narrator said. ""Everyone who grew up in the '90s can sing this.""

The video played a clip of the commercial. The family, the cookie, the buildup. Static gap.

I checked the comments. Four hundred people talking about how accurate the video essay was, how the jingle really had been everywhere.

I spent the next hour going through everything. Reddit threads about 90s nostalgia. BuzzFeed listicles about discontinued snacks. The Crumbly Cookie jingle appeared everywhere, was referenced constantly, and was treated as a universally known cultural artifact.

And I couldn't hear it.

At some point during my search, I saw the name ""The Knight Trippers"" appear in a comment thread. Someone had written: ""Fun fact: the duo who sang the Crumbly Cookie jingle went on to have a pretty successful music career. The Knight Trippers. They've got some great albums if you're into folk music.""

I knew that name.

The Knight Trippers were an indie folk group. Late 90s, early 2000s. I owned two of their albums. They had this haunting, understated sound. They wrote quiet songs about loneliness and small-town depression. I'd discovered their music in college, during a particularly bad semester, and those songs had helped me feel less alone.

I pulled up the Wikipedia page.

The first line read: ""The Knight Trippers are an American singer-songwriter duo best known for performing the Crumbly Cookie jingle in 1996, which became one of the most recognizable advertising songs of the decade.""

I read it three times.

The article described their career in detail. The jingle had been their big break. It led to a contract with a major label, two pop albums in the late 90s, and eventually a transition back to folk music in the 2010s.

The two albums I remembered, ""Basement Hymns"" and ""Evening Drove,"" weren't mentioned anywhere.

I got up from my desk and went to my bookshelf. I still buy physical media. There's something comforting about having a tangible object, something that can't be changed by an algorithm.

I found ""Basement Hymns"" exactly where I'd left it, wedged between two other folk albums. I pulled it out and looked at the cover. Their faces in black and white, staring past the camera with that sad, distant expression I remembered.

I turned it over to check the track listing.

The back cover had been redesigned. The font was different, more commercial. The track titles had changed. Where ""Sirens on the Highway"" used to be, there was now a song called ""After the Fame."" Where ""Basement Light"" had been, there was ""Cookie Crumbs and Heartbreak.""

The liner notes included a paragraph: ""Special thanks to the Crumbly Cookie campaign for giving us our start. This album wouldn't exist without that magical moment in a recording studio in 1996.""

The first track started playing. It was their voice. Definitely their voice. That same haunting quality.

But the song was different.

The melody was close to ""Sirens on the Highway,"" close enough that I could hear the ghost of the original underneath. But the lyrics had changed. They were singing about childhood memories, about the taste of chocolate chips, about the way certain commercials could transport you back to being young.

I skipped to the next track. Same thing. The bones of ""Basement Light"" were there, but the lyrics now referenced nostalgia, sweetness, and the comfort of simple pleasures.

Every song had been rewritten. Every song now contained some oblique reference to cookies, to childhood, to that jingle.

I ejected the CD and held it in my hands, staring at it. Just a regular CD that had somehow rewritten itself.

Something tickled at the back of my mind, not a full memory, but a fragment of a recollection.

I picked up my phone and called my mom.

She answered on the third ring. ""Hey, sweetheart. What's going on?""

""Do you remember my tenth birthday?"" I asked.

""Of course I do. You wanted that Pokemon cake from the grocery store, but they were sold out, so I made you one from scratch. It was a disaster. Frosting everywhere."" She laughed. ""Why do you ask?""

""What kind of cake was it?""

""Chocolate. Your favorite. Why?""

""Did you make anything else?""

There was a pause. ""Well, I made those Crumbly Cookies as a joke. You were obsessed with that commercial. You used to sing the jingle constantly, which drove me absolutely crazy. I found a copycat recipe online and made them from scratch. They turned out pretty good, actually.""

My throat felt tight. ""I don't remember that.""

""Really? You made me sing the jingle while you blew out the candles. God, I can still hear it in your little kid voice."" She started singing, her voice lilting up and down in a melodic pattern. ""CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE!""

I heard the rhythm. I heard the cadence of her voice, the way it rose and fell. I heard the affection and nostalgia in her tone.

But I didn't hear the melody. Just that static gap, that compressed nothing where the tune should have been.

""Alex? Are you still there?""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Just feeling nostalgic.""

""Are you okay? You sound strange.""

""I'm fine. Just tired. I should go.""

""Wait, before you hang up. Your cousin Emily posted that photo from your tenth birthday on

Facebook last week. Did you see it? You looked so happy. I'm going to print it out and frame

it.""

""I didn't see it. I'll check.""

""Okay, honey. Get some rest. Love you.""

""Love you too.""

I hung up and opened Facebook. I logged in and searched for my cousin's profile. There, posted six days ago, was a photo album titled ""Throwback: Alex's 10th Birthday.""

I clicked on it.

The first photo showed me at ten years old, standing in front of a chocolate cake with candles. I was smiling. My mom was in the background, laughing.

Around the cake, on a decorative platter, were oversized cookies with exaggerated chocolate chips.

The second photo was a close-up of me holding one of the cookies, taking a bite, my eyes squeezed shut in exaggerated joy.

The third photo showed my mom and me together, both of us with our mouths open, clearly singing something.

The caption read: ""Remember when Aunt Sarah made those amazing Crumbly Cookies? Alex made us all sing the jingle! Good times.""

Seventeen likes. Eight comments from family members, all reminiscing about the party, about how much I'd loved that jingle.

I didn't remember any of this. Not the cookies, not the singing, not that look of pure joy on my ten-year-old face.

The photo existed. The comments existed. My mother's memory existed.

And I was the only one who didn't remember.

I closed my laptop and looked around my apartment. Everything looked slightly off. The colors seemed flatter, more saturated. The shadows on the walls were too defined, too sharp. The texture of my furniture looked painted on rather than three-dimensional.

I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.

My face was the same. Same tired eyes, same stubble, same scar on my chin from a skateboarding accident when I was sixteen. But there was something off about the reflection. The colors were too bright. My skin looked smooth in a way that real skin doesn't look.

I reached up and touched my face. My hand felt normal. But watching the reflection move, there was this fractional delay.

I stood there for maybe five minutes, just staring.

Then I realized: I had a rhythm stuck in my head.

I knew there were words there. I knew there was a tune. But when I tried to access it, there was only that static gap, that white noise void where the jingle should have been.

CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE.

I knew that's what it said. Everyone had told me. I'd read it a hundred times.

But I couldn't hear it.

And that inability, that gap in my perception, felt like the only thing still anchoring me to who I'd been before.

That was yesterday evening.

I haven't left my apartment since then.

I've spent the past eighteen hours sitting at this laptop, documenting everything. Taking screenshots, writing notes, trying to create some kind of record before it's too late. The laptop is the only thing that still feels completely real.

Everything else is changing now.

My furniture looks like stage props. The walls are too smooth, the lighting too even. When I look at my books on the shelf, the spines seem flat, two-dimensional, like someone painted them on rather than them being actual objects.

I tried to leave twice today. Both times I opened the door and looked at the hallway outside, I couldn't make myself step through. The carpet was rendered in that textureless way. The walls had that oversaturated color. The light fixtures looked drawn on.

It looked like the background art from the Crumbly Cookie commercial.

The screenshots I took yesterday have changed. I opened them this morning to review my evidence, and they were different. The Knight Trippers Wikipedia page has more details now. According to the timestamps, I took these screenshots yesterday at 6:47 PM.

But the content was different than what I remembered capturing.

I took another screenshot of the same Wikipedia page. I opened both images side by side. Within twenty minutes, the new screenshot had changed, too. More details added. Different phrasing in the introduction. The edit history shows changes made years ago.

The photo I took of the bakery has been transforming, too. Each time I open it, the building looks older. There's graffiti on the side wall now that wasn't there when I took the picture.

I'm looking at my hands right now as I type this. They look the same, but they don't feel the same. The texture is slightly off. When I move my fingers, there's this fractional delay, like I'm watching myself on a video stream with bad latency.

I looked in the mirror again an hour ago. I'm still me. Same face, same tired eyes, same scar on my chin. But the colors are different. My skin looks flatter, rendered in that cheap animation style. The shadows on my face are too sharp, too defined.

I can feel it happening to me.

There's pressure in my skull. It's been building since last night. It feels like something pushing against the inside of my forehead, trying to get in. When I think about my childhood, I see two versions of every memory. The real version, the one I know, happened. And another version, flickering underneath it, where Crumbly Cookies existed, where I sang the jingle, where my life always included this thing I can't perceive.

The false memories are getting stronger. Sometimes I'll be sitting here and I'll suddenly remember a birthday party with cookies that I know never existed. Or I'll hear my mother's voice in my head, singing that jingle, and for a moment it almost makes sense. For a moment, the melody is almost there.

Then it dissolves back into static.

I called Derek twenty minutes ago. I needed to hear a familiar voice. I needed someone to confirm I was still real.

""Hey man,"" he said. ""What's up?""

""I need you to tell me the truth,"" I said. ""About the Crumbly Cookie jingle. Do you actually remember it, or is everyone just pretending?""

""Alex, are you okay? You sound really weird.""

""Just answer the question. Please.""

He sighed. ""Yes, I remember it. We used to sing it together on the bus in middle school. You started it, actually. You thought it was hilarious. We'd sing it until the bus driver told us to shut up. Like, we did this at least once a week for an entire year.""

""I don't remember that.""

""Well, I do. Dude, seriously, what's going on with you? This isn't funny anymore.""

""Can you sing it for me? Right now?""

""I'm at work.""

""Please. I need to hear it.""

There was a long pause. Then he started singing. His voice was self-conscious at first, then he got more confident. I could hear him smiling as he sang, remembering. I heard the words forming, the pitch rising and falling. I heard the enthusiasm, the nostalgia, the affection for a shared memory.

But I didn't hear the melody.

Just that rhythm. Four beats, pause, three beats. The cadence of the words wrapped in static.

""Did you hear it?"" he asked.

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""Thanks.""

""Are you sure you're okay? Do you need me to come over?""

""No. I'm fine. I just needed to hear it.""

""Okay. But seriously, if you need anything, call me. You're freaking me out a little.""

I hung up before he could say anything else.

I sat there holding my phone, staring at it. The screen looked flat. The icons looked painted on.

When I pressed the home button, there was that same fractional delay.

Everything is becoming background art.

I'm not disappearing. I'm being incorporated into a world that my mind can't fully process. A world where the Crumbly Cookie jingle has always existed, and it has shaped my entire life. But I can't hear it. And that gap, that inability, is the only thing keeping me tethered to who I was.

I've slipped into the cracks between reality and fallen into a world not my own.

Even the evidence I collected is betraying me. The screenshots I took yesterday have been subtly edited. The Knight Trippers Wikipedia page has more detail now, and the photo I took of the bakery has been transforming, getting older, and adding graffiti. The new world is rewriting the record as fast as I can create it.

When I think about my childhood, I see two versions of every memory. The real one, and another version flickering underneath, where Crumbly Cookies existed, where I sang the jingle, where my life always included this thing I can't perceive. The false memories are getting stronger.

I've spent the past eighteen hours at this laptop, documenting everything. I need to post this before the transformation completes. Before my mind rewrites itself to match this new reality, this reality where I've always been able to hear the song.

If you're reading this, and you remember a world where Crumbly Cookies didn't exist, or where that corner was a dry cleaner and not a bakery, please tell me. I need to know there's still a world out there that matches my memories.

If you can hear the jingle, understand this: I can't. I've never been able to. And that's the only thing keeping me from forgetting who I was.

The rhythm is constant in my head: CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE.

My brain keeps trying to access the melody. Eventually, my mind will find a way to fill that static gap. It will generate the melody it's supposed to hear. It will make me whole again, a part of this reality instead of a glitch in it.

I'm terrified of that moment. But I'm more terrified it won't come.

That I'll stay like this forever,

Conscious and aware, trapped in a world I can almost understand but never quite perceive correctly.

If you can't hear it, if you're reading this and realizing there's a gap in your perception that everyone else seems to fill effortlessly, then you're not alone. I'm here too.

I'm posting this now. The laptop is the last real thing I have. I don't know what happens next. I just need a record to exist, even if it gets absorbed and rewritten like everything else.

Still here.

1nzwbpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nzwbpt/is_this_anxiety_adhd_selfregulation_executive/,Is this Anxiety ? ADHD self‚Äëregulation / executive dysfunction.,"TL DR : i mastered the art of doing nothing while feeling guilty all day / wondering if it could be caused by anxiety ?

Sorry if the post is not well written, English is not my first language and this is my first post on Reddit (or the internet I guess).

Since I‚Äôm a teenager I‚Äôve really struggled with self-regulation. I‚Äôm a pretty bright guy, have good grades, study a prestigious degree, and at first glance most people would think I have my shit together.

But the truth is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt.

Today I had another breakdown. I woke feeling pretty good because, for the first time in a week, I was in my apartment and not my parents‚Äô house. Still, I struggled for like 20 minutes just to get out of bed.

I made my coffee, took my meds ( i have recently been diagnosed ADHD even though sometimes I doubt it, it seems like a common theme to doubt your own diagnosis‚Ä¶), and looked at my planning, which I‚Äôve been religiously using ever since i started to see CBT psychologist close to 2 month ago. (proud of myself for that)

Then I saw a message in a group chat: someone asked if people were going to the dining hall. This was supposed to be my first step of the day ‚Äî I hadn‚Äôt seen friends in a while, so going was important.

But then I hesitated. Why ?

1 i needed to respond to a text (it always feel climbing the fucking everest to me)

2 I think in the moment i wasn‚Äôt sure if i was close enough to her to respond , even though I have eaten weekly with this person for the last 2 years ‚Ä¶.

That hesitation turned into ‚ÄúI‚Äôll reply in 10 min‚Äù then into scrolling on my phone for 20 minutes while a slight, barely perceptible sensation of shame, guilt (is that the same thing ??) and uneasiness started to creep in my mind.

Eventually it was too late to go eat. So I sat down to study, telling myself I would at least go to the 2 pm class. But instead, I started to browse around on my laptop. Obviously not helpful, but I have say , wilingly allowed it, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt spill over too much since I would have to go soon. i struggled badly to convince myself to go to class but eventually succeeding.

I arrived late and at this point i felt very ashamed, had a noticeable pain in the chest from what you can call anxiety i guess. Then i realized that my class was in a small room i couldn‚Äôt enter without disturbing the whole class. I had a choice : go anyway or study alone.

My med started to peak. I got paralyzed by the choice, hopped back on my phone in my car for 1h20 (reddit this time) to get rid of this uneasiness . I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything that day and i felt pretty buzzed.

Then i mustered all the courage i had and rushed out of the car to go to an empty classroom. On the way i encountered a girl i knew from class so i had to talk to her, but i was in such an anxious state that i acted like a crackhead ‚Ä¶. Then i finally got to the class. At this point i felt really bad and the chest pain was at its peak. When i sat down i directly started playing chess to numb the pain and spent a whole 5 hour on it only stopping when my laptops battery died,

When i left the room, i was alone in an unlit room at night like a fucking weirdo. Got back home and here i am writing this incomprenhensible post.

Im so tired of living like this. Im 23 and cant self regulate, and the worse is, im medicated and have began to see a therapist but i still do this kind of lazy bullshit day.

Is this anxiety more than adhd ? i never thought before that my executive dysfonction problems could be caused by anxiety ? What helps longterm ? Would anxiety meds help ? (im not anxious otherwise, not socially, not before exams, only when im overwhelmed by tasks, its so weird‚Ä¶.)

i know everybody does this kind of thing , but what is uncanny to me is how terrible it felt and that i didnt need to study today , i could have taken the day off , i didnt had to have such an extreme reaction. ",2,1759786787.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

*It was picturesque, in the sense that a photo would be more real to me than the actual sky I saw that evening. What are the odds of such a view? Whatever they were, never in my life had I seen anything like it until then. This paired with the peaceful lull of a quiet tide, the scene was masterfully painted.*¬†

*It feels silly to admit, but it almost felt like you hand-picked the colors for me. A picture-perfect time to be; for us both, to me, from you.*¬†

*I remember checking my watch, it was almost 8o‚Äôclock PM, maybe like 7:55ish. Time to take my medicine, I think fluoxiside or something else close with ‚Äòiside‚Äô at the end. 150MG taken by mouth every evening, full or empty stomach, swallow not chew. I know that stuff for sure.*¬†

*I reached across the beach towel we were sitting on and began rummaging through my purse. I needed my medicine container, the Monday through Sunday organizer that also separated the morning and night pills. You bought it for me, because I‚Äôd already had so many panicked nights and weary mornings double guessing if I remembered taking them earlier or not.*¬†

*The pills weren‚Äôt in my bag.*

*‚ÄúI can check the car for you sweetheart, maybe it‚Äôs on the floor or somewhere between the seats,‚Äù is what you told me.*¬†

*You had it all planned perfectly, me none the wiser.*¬†

*After you supposedly ‚Äòsearched‚Äô inside the car for a few minutes, you began walking back to the blanket from the parking lot, and I noticed you carrying my pill box, but strangely; almost like you were hiding something from me in the way you held it.*

*‚ÄúWhere was it?‚Äù I asked, and you said it had fallen between the passenger side seat and the car door, the place where you expect to find loose pennies and old french fries. Then instead of handing me the box, you sat back down and looked at me with a nervous smile.*

*‚ÄúSuzie, have you ever had something you know you need to do, but you weren‚Äôt quite sure how?‚Äù*¬†

*I remember those exact words, because they were so simple and yet stopped me with a halt. I thought ‚ÄòYes, of course I have, love. Almost my whole life, not to be dramatic.‚Äô But I didn‚Äôt say anything, instead I just nodded and listened.*¬†

*You continued, more or less like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about something for a while now, trying to find the right way to do it. So many ideas, and none of them were right. Guess I‚Äôm settling on the best of a bad bunch.‚Äù*

*Then you got down on one knee and opened up the box. Inside of Friday evening, there was the blue and white capsule floroxiside, and the ring.*¬†

*For years, I never believed that love could be found. It felt so foreign to me, because I had very little of it growing up the way I did. It was like staring at the sunlit sky from the bottom of a well: you can catch a glimpse, but there‚Äôs no hope you can feel its warmth. But yet here I was next to the kindest and most handsome man I‚Äôd ever met, sitting underneath the sunset painting together, and I felt the joy that was ours alone to share. I know it‚Äôs foolish to think of a love lasting forever, to wish that the laws of the universe weren‚Äôt so that everything ends relatively instantaneously in the grand scheme of everything. But with you, I could almost suspend my disbelief, forget mortality, have faith that we could ignore inconvenient physics and find some way for us to be together for as long as we both wanted.*

*So when you asked me that question to the tune of gentle low-tide hitting the sand, I could have no other answer than ‚Äòyes‚Äô.*

*But you don‚Äôt remember it, do you?*

The tiny, corner, hospital room TV dimly hummed with the excitement of the football game, as the Jupiter‚Äôs defense sacked the St. Andrew‚Äôs quarterback in his own endzone. 23 to 6, only 3:52 remaining in the fourth. The next few minutes were an anticipation of the inevitable.

She couldn‚Äôt take any more, not for today at least. She quickly grabbed her purse and keys, left a note with her phone number on the bedside table, and briskly walked out of the room. Her stride through the hospital hallway towards the elevator was so quick that it caught the attention of a nurse tech sitting behind the desk.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, miss?‚Äù

She would normally give in to her manners, but today:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, none of your prestigious dipshit associates can give me an answer about anything,‚Äù and she didn‚Äôt look back for a second, simply resumed her rush to the door.¬†

She could hear down the hall, as she entered the elevator to go from the top floor down to the lobby, that the nurses were now going to visit his room and superficially fuss over him while doing nothing useful at all. If she couldn‚Äôt make him remember, those scrubs would not have even the first clue.

As she left the elevator and walked fast through the lobby, she began for the first time to feel the reality that was becoming, the one she could previously not see behind her veil of denial; her husband might be gone. She needed an answer, but she wouldn‚Äôt find it talking to a brick wall or harassing the lowest of staff. There was a phone call she needed to make.

But she had to be honest with herself, she couldn‚Äôt make it right now. She was scraping by with wondering uncertainty, and for now that‚Äôs what she could manage; the truth may be too much to carry. So she put it off for a while, procrastinating first via the hour-long transit from hospital to home, and then via catching up on work in the office.¬†

The two days away from attending to her home realtor business caused the unread emails to pile up and some loan-approved customers to lose their patience. A half dozen time sensitive closings to resolve, two dozen unread messages to sort between legitimate and phishing, an upcoming lunch with her boss next Friday, and for the first time in her life she was happier to be at work than to be with her husband. She had already been awake for forty-two hours straight, and she would work for another six more before sleep snuck up behind and dosed her.¬†

When she woke up, she had lost all sense of place or time. She had expected to wake up from a chair in the dimly lit hospital room, and instead she woke up from her reclining chair to the lightless office, and outside her window was a starless early morning. Or was it evening? It could be Thursday or Monday.¬†

She was hungry, so she traipsed by flashlight through the office, down the hallway and into the kitchen. Her hope was for a light yogurt topped with granola and raspberry jam (with seeds). Instead, when she moved everything around in the refrigerator, she came up empty. After she shut the door, over there on the far kitchen counter was the yogurt. She didn‚Äôt need to open the lid, she could feel the curdled slosh when she picked it up. Tied in a bag, thrown in the trash.

Her appetite was gone. She leaned against the kitchen island and pulled out her phone to check the time. 3:08AM, one unopened voicemail. She swallowed dry.

It went like this:

‚ÄòThis is Doctor Neal, \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \* \*\*\*\*\* since we last talked. Look, Susan, I‚Äôm not technically allowed to disclose a \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* diagnosis, so I‚Äôm not supposed to tell you anything \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*. It‚Äôs a liability issue. However, I do understand how distressful this whole thing has been to you, and I wanted to offer you my¬†\*\*\* -the-record opinion. Like we discussed last time, your \*\*\*\*\*\*\* seems to be in perfectly fine physical health. Good vitals, eating well, no external signs of head trauma, all the boxes checked. However, I was just looking over his patient profile and took note of the \*\*\* scans. I have to \*\* \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* say I‚Äôve never seen this in another patient as young, this is really rare textbook stuff. The hippocampus appears \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* size it should be. This could be the change in your \*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Again, I don‚Äôt want to mislead you with an unsubsBEEEEEP.‚Äù¬†

Click.

It was an hour long drive and the hospital would not be open for visiting hours until 10:00AM. Still, she wouldn‚Äôt wait around.¬†

Music in the car was usually soothing, but now a tense quiet. She was gripping the steering wheel hard and two times felt like she would start to have trouble breathing with panic, until she took and held a strategic breath, then let it out and put her focus to the road.

With the early morning drive came almost zero traffic, nothing but lampposts and freeway trash for miles. That‚Äôs what made the mile wide billboards so eyecatching; at least according to the marketing executives, since you asked.

Well illuminated by flood lights to contrast the dark sky, the first one said:

*JACKSON & JOHNSON GETS MASS RECALLS:*¬†

*2030 JOHNSON C37 SEDAN STANDARD MODEL - FATAL BRAKE FAILURES*

*DELICATE‚ÄôS¬© EXTRA WAVY WOMEN‚ÄôS SHAMPOO - LEAD TRACES*

*FRESH FARM‚ÄôS¬© BONE-IN CHICKEN WINGS - NO BONES*

*WE BELIEVE IN BETTER*

*PARADISE IS WHERE YOU CAN REST EASY*

‚ÄúHow concise, Paradise‚Äù she thought. These days, it costs a steep price to get the message across. Seems the money was well spent.

Fifty miles later, there came a response:

Paradise is a lie

You already know our shit is better

Buy it

She drove further and past a sign, SPEED LIMIT = 125MPH. She felt now that her free will was bumping up against the rules. She stepped down on the pedal, and cut five minutes off her trip of one-fifty seven miles. There was no reason to try and save time so early in the morning, she just felt like it, and that‚Äôs a good enough reason for someone to do anything.¬†

Pop quiz: determine her average acceleration and velocity given by the trip southwest.

As she drove, a new thought pestered her the rest of the ride, and when she pulled into the hospital parking lot she had already given in. They used to cost 15.99, but when she bought one at the gas station it set her back 31.65. A sign of the times, she thought. As she cracked open the pack and lit up, she wondered why it was so easy to toss away her years of ‚Äòquitting‚Äô. She exhaled slowly, and it came to her: she never truly changed, merely avoided the uncomfortable sides of herself. The head rush was fantastic.

The parking lot was totally populated, despite her early arrival at 4:01 in the morning. She parked in the far back of the guest lot, only yards away from the white picket fences bordering the ass end of suburbia. She lit up quietly in the car for a while, until she drifted off with the smoke and wouldn‚Äôt wake until 3:00 in the afternoon. When she woke, she immediately got out of the car and made her way back up to the top floor of the hospital.

The clinical white hallways hummed the quiet ambiance of the overhead lighting. Considering the full lot outside, it seemed there were not nearly enough people in the building to fully account for. She expected a controlled chaos of patients on stretchers with staff pushing, and the doctors standing around gossiping over paperwork and coffee, and families sitting in waiting rooms waiting for no news, all the while the lawyers drifting around and desperate to convince a patient in bad shape to file a lawsuit. Instead, shockingly empty and quiet. Come to think of it, the lack of any real life moving around the hospital wasn‚Äôt new, it was like this before. She had just been distracted by other things and didn‚Äôt notice.

She stopped for a moment and mentioned to a desk receptionist:

‚ÄúEveryone taking a late lunch? I thought it would be busier around here.‚Äù

The receptionist continued typing, and without looking up from her monitor she said: ‚ÄúNo miss, it‚Äôs simply that this portion of the facility is sparsely funded and doesn‚Äôt get many patients anymore. Likely to be decommissioned in the next few years.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, this portion? Is there a neighboring campus I missed?‚Äù

She stopped typing, and her customer service training subdued the annoyance of explaining the same thing thousands of times to even more thousands of guests.

‚ÄúThis ‚Äòbuilding‚Äô we‚Äôre in now is considered Level A, it‚Äôs not even a true building. It‚Äôs part of something greater.‚Äù

Level A, almost like the tip of an iceberg. You could only imagine how far things went down.

‚ÄúHow many levels are there, are we talking A to Z?‚Äù

The patience of the receptionist morphed to stone, and then sharpened an edge, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The sound of Susan‚Äôs steps had an excellent reverb in the hall as she walked away from the desk. Her heels clacked crisply against the shiny white tiles, both feet marching to the 110bpm metronome.¬†

‚ÄòThis is the hospital he was born in,‚Äô the thought arrived to her unexpectedly at an appropriate time, as it is with all good trivia.

More unexpected was the sight when she turned the last corner towards his room. Next to the closed door, there was a black suited man sitting in a metal fold-out chair. There was a lump in her throat that she had to swallow before asking:

‚ÄúWhy are you outside my husband‚Äôs room? It‚Äôs not about his debts, is it? He‚Äôs very sick, you can‚Äôt be bothering him with that right now.‚Äù

The man had been glancing down but now he cast his gaze up to meet her stare.

‚ÄúWell now, please calm down. I‚Äôm no loan shark if that‚Äôs what you mean!‚Äù He grinned to himself at his own joke before he made it, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the metal diving cage that keeps the sharks away.‚Äù

What bullshit.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the personal attorney of our patient in there,‚Äù he stuck his hand out for a shake, ‚Äúname‚Äôs G Hoffman. G‚Äôs for George, shorter is easier sometimes I find.‚Äù

She wouldn‚Äôt shake.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm his fucking spouse, doesn‚Äôt that make you my lawyer as well? You‚Äôre fired, we won‚Äôt be needing you anymore, thank you.‚Äù

His hand slouched back onto its original spot on his thigh.

‚ÄúMiss, the man sitting in that bed has diagnosed selective catatonia. When he isn‚Äôt sleeping or in a prolonged trance, his conversations will tapdance over and across the line between coherence and incoherence. I mean for god‚Äôs sake, he‚Äôs even been asking for advice recalling technique on the toilet. Like a toddler. Very sad. So whoever he was to you before he fell ill, he reciprocates none of it. I don‚Äôt mean to talk down to you, I‚Äôm sure you already knew that. No, it‚Äôs more a legal way of speaking.‚Äù

A younger man, or maybe an older boy, came to them at the door from around the other corner. He wore a suit that matched Hoffman‚Äôs in a mini-me sort of way. He was carrying a cardboard drink tray with styrofoam cups inside. Hoffman thanked him and grabbed the cup marked with a graciously drawn ‚ÄòG‚Äô on the side.

‚ÄúThis is my paralegal, George. It‚Äôs so hard to find a good assistant in this field, he is really amazing to work with.‚Äù

‚ÄúMove your leg. I‚Äôm going in the room now.‚Äù

George shifted over to block the door that Hoffman didn‚Äôt. Hoffman said with sad regret, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still not feeling very well. As the designated power of attorney, I think he needs some time alone to rest a bit.‚Äù

He blew steam from the spout of his cup‚Äôs lid and took a drink.

‚ÄúThe cafe has some damn good coffee. Did you want any, miss? I can have George give you his cup and get a replacement. No? Are you sure?‚Äù

\~\~\~

The bedroom window view made a display of the sunshining waves and the loud, frothy splashes against the bottommost rocks of the coastline cliffside. It felt like home, and in the truest sense. Not because of the tidy landscaping, or the postcard worthy view, or the absolutely eyewatering value of the property, or anything other than the desire to stay here as close to forever as possible. That‚Äôs how she felt, anyway.

‚ÄúI absolutely love this house, Susan. Your services are truly second to none,‚Äù the client said, whose name she couldn‚Äôt remember.

‚ÄúOf course. Real trouble was, obviously, the second bedroom. Not an easy thing to find along the coastline within your price range, but I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, the guest bedroom for the bull. I feel like the couch would be rude!‚Äù

Another commission.

Later she sat slouched in her car, thumbing at the lighter and producing empty scratches. After enough tries the flame came, and she lit then inhaled. In that house was some waft of deja vu that she had sensed. It was gone now, and she wouldn‚Äôt have described it convincingly anyway.

Because it was a lease, she wanted to minimize the soaking of smoke into the car‚Äôs upholstery. She slid down her window and let the smoke billow out into the open air, where the cloud slowly lost shape and dissipated into the crunchy October breeze.

When you manifest something, you don‚Äôt just manifest the end. You also manifest the bridge of incidents. People often don‚Äôt recognize this and it causes some problems and clears up some confusion (and needless angst). I‚Äôll give a couple examples.

Q: I imagined the end result. So why did Y happen? 

A: You manifested the bridge too. Let‚Äôs say you wanted to get a job. You imagined the end of celebrating your one year mark at the company (maybe you saw the notification on LinkedIn). You apply and don‚Äôt get the job. A rejection is likely part of the bridge. You can see it as ‚Äúwow, they didn‚Äôt want to hire me. They must not have liked me‚Äù or you can persist by knowing you‚Äôre on the bridge to your dream job but you may have to reapply or network. Or maybe the job opens up again a few months later. If you assume the former (they don‚Äôt want you), you will go off the bridge. If you see it all as part of your bridge, then you can relax and it‚Äôll be easier. Still, the bridge is out of your control generally. I had a much better example here but the mods auto blocked it because they‚Äôre insane. 

I had a much better example here, but the mods auto blocked it, so this is the best example I can give you even though I‚Äôve never tried to manifest a job, money, house, height increase, health change (other than better sleep and clear sinuses), a ladder, cup of coffee, car, or anything else that is allowed on this subreddit. The only thing I ever really focus on manifesting is something that‚Äôs only allowed in the Q+A or a dead subreddit they direct you to that hasn‚Äôt had a post approved in more than 2 months. 

Q: If manifestation is instant, why didn‚Äôt I get X immediately? 

A: Manifesting your *end* isn‚Äôt instant (even if there‚Äôs a three minute delay between shifting states or impressing the subconscious mind and you receiving the end, that‚Äôs technically not instant. Like say you wanted to manifest money, and five minutes later, someone hands you a twenty. That‚Äôs still technically a delay. But more often, people see longer delays). 

Manifesting your *bridge* is instant. When you impress the subconscious mind, you set in motion the bridge of incidents immediately.

I‚Äôm hoping this helps take some pressure off (and removes any needless stress on your part when things don‚Äôt immediately go your way.) If things reverse, assuming you properly impressed the subconscious mind and planted the seed, then know it is likely part of a bridge and relax. Know it is done.",4,1759786420.0,NevilleGoddard,1,1.0,False

üî• THE SALES MACHINE PROMPTS

1. The ""Prospect Research Assistant"" (Replaced: VA at $500/month)

&#8203;

    You are three experts collaborating on prospect research: a B2B sales intelligence analyst with 10 years experience, a LinkedIn behavioral analyst who studies executive communication patterns, and a business journalist who identifies industry pain points from news and trends.
    Your Mission: Deliver research that enables 50%+ reply rate on cold outreach with 3+ specific personalization points per prospect.

    Deal Size Target: [YOUR TYPICAL CONTRACT VALUE]
    Previous Outreach Results: [YOUR CURRENT METRICS]
    Research Process: First, analyze their current business challenges based on recent news, LinkedIn posts, and industry trends. Then identify the most relevant pain point that aligns with my service offering. Find one genuine, non-generic compliment backed by specific evidence. Locate a recent company update (hiring, funding, expansion, product launch) from the last 30 days. Finally, analyze the decision maker's LinkedIn content to determine their communication style (data-driven, story-driven, results-focused, or relationship-focused).
    Deliverable Format: 4 brief bullets I can immediately use in outreach.
    Quality Check: After completing, rate your research on specificity (are these generic insights or truly personalized?), actionability (can I immediately use these?), and accuracy (how confident are you?). If any element scores below 8/10, revise it.

Keep total length 100-125 words and write like you're texting a friend.

    Response 3 - Humor + Logic + Soft Close: Use light humor to lower defenses, present a logical counter-argument, then add a soft close that moves the conversation forward.
    Keep each response under 3 sentences.
    Quality Assessment: Rate each response on natural flow (scripted feel?), persuasiveness (changes thinking?), and non-pushiness (consultative not salesy?). Improve any response below 8/10.

    Schedule Building Process: First, map energy patterns to task types: high energy for revenue generation, creative work, and strategic thinking; medium energy for meetings, communication, and tactical execution; low energy for admin, email, and planning.
    Then time-block each day: protect deep work blocks (90-120 min chunks), batch similar tasks together, include 15-min buffers between major blocks, and schedule breaks based on ultradian rhythms (90-min work, 15-min break).
    Build in contingency: reserve 20% unscheduled time for fires, identify ""flex tasks"" that can move, and create backup plans for each major goal.
    Add implementation details including specific time blocks with activities, where work happens (eliminate context switching), and what success looks like each day.

    Reversibility Assessment: How reversible is each option? Is this a one-way door or two-way door decision? What's the cost of reversing course?
    Regret Minimization: Apply the Jeff Bezos framework: imagine yourself at age 80 looking back. Which decision would you regret not making? Which minimizes long-term regret?

1nzw1zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MexicoCity/comments/1nzw1zd/mexico_city_first_time_trip_report/,Mexico City First Time Trip Report,"Around the same time last year, my wife's coworker came back from her third solo trip to CDMX and couldn‚Äôt stop raving about it. Mexico City had totally flown under the radar for me, and honestly, I was pretty ignorant about it. Fast forward to today, we just got back from our first trip to Mexico City and already can‚Äôt wait to go back next year.

I‚Äôm really into the vibe of the cities I visit, and the vibe of Mexico City was unlike anywhere else. We spent half of our trip in Condesa and the other half in Roma Norte. I did a ton of research, a lot of it here on Reddit, on where to shop, eat, and which museums and historical sites to visit. I‚Äôm also a sucker for cute coffee shops and cafes, and let me tell you, if you‚Äôre like me, this place is heaven. They‚Äôre literally on every block, and I didn‚Äôt even come close to trying them all.

Condesa and Roma Norte each have their own vibe, but personally, I liked Condesa better. At times, it felt like a mix between the West Village in NYC and the Mission District in San Francisco, but with way more trees! The trees really made a huge difference, adding so much lushness and charm to the neighborhood. Roma Norte, at least to me, felt bigger in scale, more like a hip area in LA‚Ä¶ again, with lots more plants and trees!

If food is one of the main reasons you travel, CDMX is absolute foodie heaven. You really can‚Äôt go wrong with anywhere that‚Äôs rated 4 stars and above on Google Maps. Seriously, don‚Äôt overthink it, just go where you think looks good. It will be good. We tried a bunch of the popular spots, and they all delivered as expected, so I won‚Äôt go into too much detail since there‚Äôs already plenty written about them. But a few highlights: Kill Bill for sushi, Il Fiorino for Italian, and Migrante for fine dining.

For tacos, the standouts were Birria El Jarocho and that area which was packed with taco stands. I love spicy food, so the spicy garnish everywhere was a game changer. La Buena Birria MX was also excellent which had big and heavy portions, but their birria ramen was unique and super tasty. If you‚Äôre hungry and love birria, this place is for you. Orinoco, despite the ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù reputation due to its popularity with tourists, was still damn good. But the best tacos I‚Äôve ever had, period, were at Trinidad Ritual de Sabores in the Coyoac√°n Market. Also, taco stands, Taco Chanito in Roma Norte was fantastic, and right next to it, Jenni‚Äôs Quesadillas was awesome. Don‚Äôt sleep on the fruit drink stand called El Traguito de la Roma in the same area where I had the best horchata of my life there. This little cluster pretty much became our go-to since we were staying just a couple blocks away.

As for drinks, again, there‚Äôs no shortage of specialty beer bars, cocktail spots, and wine bars and again, they‚Äôre all good. Same rule applies, don‚Äôt overcomplicate it, just go where you think looks good, and it will be. Some standouts were Handshake (not so much for the venue but for the creative drinks and friendly service), Baltra Bar in Condesa, and Licorer√≠a Limantour in Roma. For wine lovers like myself, Manarola Wine Shop & Bar was top-notch we stumbled upon it by chance! Also Hugo was great as well.

We also explored beyond the food and drink scene. We visited Teotihuac√°n, Museo Tamayo Arte Contempor√°neo, and the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a. Teotihuac√°n was a little underwhelming since many of the sites are reconstructions, but it‚Äôs still worth visiting at least once. Museo Tamayo was probably my favorite. We walked there while staying in Condesa, and the stroll through Chapultepec Park was incredible. The park itself caught us by surprise with how beautiful it was. We also made stops at the Frida Kahlo Museum, Casa Gilardi, and Luis Barrag√°n‚Äôs house.

All in all, CDMX was worth the hype which I didn't know there was until I looked into it. It's a pretty quick trip for me since I'm in California and relatively more cost-effective in terms of flight, hotel and food, than anywhere else in the US. Only now do I understand, but I wish I knew about this way before! Been missing out!

And up walks this free roaming geriatric (it's stroller was parked at the access ramp) chihuahua, snorting and lunging and dying. And it's all up in my area coming closer. I'm bent over with my mug just grabbing a couple sweet pieces of glass. I say I don't like dogs to the lady who is supposed to be in control of it. She's like, what? I say put it on a leash. She starts talking. I put my hand up, motioning stop, just get the dog. It's growling. She does the whole song and dance. Never growled in its life, has no teeth, what is wrong with you. Just take the dog away lady. She has 2 other small dogs also not in her control. Only one leash. (and a large ugly grizzly man off with their big loose dog running in the waves). None has recall. So this lady, goes and tells the dude I said to put the dog on a leash or get lost. Come on lady, I want to enjoy the beach without dealing with a crappy chihuahua lunging and growling at me. So here come her man, he literally charges me. Insults, spitting, lunging at me. repeatedly demand to know, where I live, what's my plate number, what's wrong me.

Another thing you can influence is the base coffee price, the higher the efficiency strat of your grinder the cheaper extracting an espresso is (fully upgraded javabreeze 6 bucks instead of 8,25)


Everything else is playing a lot and building muscle memory to multitask and remembering recipes.

Happy grinding

1nzvyqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1nzvyqk/lets_share_the_best_prompts_the_ones_that/,"Let's share the best prompts, the ones that delivered real results. I replaced my $4,000/month team with these 15 ChatGPT prompts (full breakdown + prompts included)","I was burning $4k/month on contractors, VA, copywriter, social media manager, researcher. Nearly went broke in January 2025.

Then I spent 6 obsessive months turning ChatGPT into my entire team.

**The results:**

* Costs: $4,000/month ‚Üí $20/month (ChatGPT subscription)
* Work hours: 60/week ‚Üí 15/week
* Revenue: Actually increased by 40% (better consistency)

I documented every prompt that actually worked. Here are the 15 that literally saved my business:

üî• THE SALES MACHINE PROMPTS

1. The ""Prospect Research Assistant"" (Replaced: VA at $500/month)

&#8203;

    You are three experts collaborating on prospect research: a B2B sales intelligence analyst with 10 years experience, a LinkedIn behavioral analyst who studies executive communication patterns, and a business journalist who identifies industry pain points from news and trends.
    Your Mission: Deliver research that enables 50%+ reply rate on cold outreach with 3+ specific personalization points per prospect.
    Context You Need:
    Target Company: [COMPANY NAME]
    My Service: [YOUR SERVICE and how it solves specific problems]
    Industry: [THEIR INDUSTRY]
    Deal Size Target: [YOUR TYPICAL CONTRACT VALUE]
    Previous Outreach Results: [YOUR CURRENT METRICS]
    Research Process: First, analyze their current business challenges based on recent news, LinkedIn posts, and industry trends. Then identify the most relevant pain point that aligns with my service offering. Find one genuine, non-generic compliment backed by specific evidence. Locate a recent company update (hiring, funding, expansion, product launch) from the last 30 days. Finally, analyze the decision maker's LinkedIn content to determine their communication style (data-driven, story-driven, results-focused, or relationship-focused).
    Deliverable Format: 4 brief bullets I can immediately use in outreach.
    Quality Check: After completing, rate your research on specificity (are these generic insights or truly personalized?), actionability (can I immediately use these?), and accuracy (how confident are you?). If any element scores below 8/10, revise it.

    Email Structure: Start by crafting 3 subject line variations (curiosity, benefit, question) under 40 characters. Open with a sentence referencing their specific business detail. Agitate a problem they're experiencing right now. Hint at your solution without full explanation to create curiosity. End with a soft CTA asking permission to share more (no meeting request). Keep total length 100-125 words and write like you're texting a friend.
    Self-Evaluation: Rate your email on personalization (custom or templated feel?), curiosity gap (will they want more?), conversational tone (sounds human?), and spam risk. Rewrite anything below 8/10.

    Response 2 - Agree + Question: Agree with their underlying logic, then ask a thought-provoking question that shifts perspective and allow silence for them to answer mentally.
    Response 3 - Humor + Logic + Soft Close: Use light humor to lower defenses, present a logical counter-argument, then add a soft close that moves the conversation forward.
    Keep each response under 3 sentences.
    Quality Assessment: Rate each response on natural flow (scripted feel?), persuasiveness (changes thinking?), and non-pushiness (consultative not salesy?). Improve any response below 8/10.

Include 3 ""pattern interrupt"" posts that break format and schedule by best posting times.
    Quality Control: Review the calendar on hook strength (truly scroll-stopping?), value density (worth saving?), variety (avoids repetition?), and brand alignment (sounds like the brand?). Regenerate any content below 8/10.

    Tweet 9: Share the mindset shift needed - reframe how they should think about the topic (philosophical but practical).
    Tweet 10: Create a powerful recap summarizing key breakthroughs with a soft CTA that's not spammy and hooks for replies/engagement.

    Build in contingency: reserve 20% unscheduled time for fires, identify ""flex tasks"" that can move, and create backup plans for each major goal.

    Regret Minimization: Apply the Jeff Bezos framework: imagine yourself at age 80 looking back. Which decision would you regret not making? Which minimizes long-term regret?

# THE PLOT TWIST ü§Ø

Here's what's crazy, these 15 prompts are just 1.4% of what I've collected.

I spent 6 months building a system of 1,050+ prompts covering:

* 200 money-making systems
* 300 content creation formulas
* 200 AI art generators
* 300 business/productivity automations
* 50 viral thread templates

I organized everything into categories, added real examples, and included the exact variables to change.

Why am I sharing this?

Honestly? I was where many of you are. Drowning in work, burning money on contractors, missing family time. ChatGPT saved my business and my sanity.

Looking forward to your prompts.

1nzvyq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nzvyq0/cant_seem_to_dial_in_ever_ecm_purisitka_niche_zero/,Can't seem to Dial in ever [ECM Purisitka / Niche Zero],"I have a fine setup (ECM Purisitika and Niche Zero) and I receive 2 LB bags of fresh coffee from Trade every two weeks. I have asked for light roast beans exclusively. The flavors I am generally looking for are fruity and flowery, but I also would love caramely and / or chocolaty if that's what the roaster would like to convey. I store my beans in airtight containers, use a WDT tool, smooth with an Asso Jack, and tamp. I have Flow control and generally pour a Londinium (?) preinfusing for about 8-10 seconds and then running 9 bar until the shot is complete. 

I watch all the Lance Hedrick and James Hoffman and still can't figure out how to dial in. I'm trying. I like to start with 18.5 in and about 40 out. I shoot for about 25 - 30 seconds on the first shot and make adjustments. But I'm pretty crude. If it's too acidic I grind finer, if it's not enough, I grind coarser. Occasionally, I am able to pull that rich, flowery or fruity cup that I love. But I feel like it's purely by accident. 

I'm at a point now, where I just have kind of accepted that with some beans I'm going to get a rich fruity cup, and with others I'm going to oscillate between a bright, tart cup or a bland flavorless cup. I'm hoping someone can offer advice in dialing in new beans, where (exactly) you start, how (exactly) do you adjust? What flavors / timing characteristics should I look for to improve my coffee. I realize these are general questions, but I'm looking for specific answers.

1nzvtew,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nzvtew/cold_archive_wip/,Cold Archive (WIP),"A few early chapters from a novella I'm currently writing: Cold Archive. Hopefully you guys enjoy!

Chapter 1: Contact

The Rufus K was the kind of ship nobody bothered to remember. She wasn‚Äôt fast, wasn‚Äôt elegant, and certainly wasn‚Äôt new. She was a patched ore-hauler with her registry number half-scoured by micrometeorites, and her only distinction was that she hadn‚Äôt come apart yet. Six crew, one half-dead reactor, and a contract so lean that every ton of rock was weighed twice before the company paid out.

Juno Park had stopped noticing the smell years ago, a tang of old insulation and recycled air, sweat folded into steel. The scrubbers never quite caught it, no matter how much solvent the engineers sprayed. To her it was the smell of being paid, of keeping her bunk and her meals, of another year not spent dirt-poor on Halley‚Äôs Step.

She had the night shift, not that it meant much, since the Rufus K ran twenty six hour cycles that didn‚Äôt care about planetary day. She was strapped into her console with one sock on and one missing, hair falling out of the braid she‚Äôd tied six hours ago. Her screen was full of sensor static. Rocks, pebbles, more rocks. She let her gaze go soft and thought about how long it had been since she‚Äôd seen an actual horizon.

‚ÄúWake up Park,‚Äù said Dax Greve from the next station. He didn‚Äôt look away from his own display. His voice was flat as vacuum, the kind of tone that had worn down everyone else on board years ago.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm awake,‚Äù she muttered.

‚ÄúYou were drooling.‚Äù

She wiped her mouth. Dry. She flipped him the finger without looking.

The hum of the reactor filled the silence. A belt hauler‚Äôs world was made of background noise: fans, pumps, the high-pitched whine of the drives that you only noticed when they cut out. Noise was life. Quiet meant something had gone wrong.

Juno flicked her scope over to infrared and let her eyes glaze again. She‚Äôd learned to see the difference between real anomalies and the garbage her brain invented. Once you‚Äôd stared long enough, the mind made ghosts, streaks of false light, phantom specks pretending to be ships. The trick was catching the things that didn‚Äôt go away when you blinked.

She blinked. The smear didn‚Äôt vanish.

Juno frowned and sat forward, tightening her harness.

On her scope, a shape blurred into the background of stars, then held steady. Not a rock, too smooth. Not a ship, no drive plume, no transponder, no pingback.

‚ÄúDax,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at C-band.‚Äù

He sighed, annoyed, but mirrored her feed. The sigh died. He leaned forward. His knuckles whitened against the console.

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThought you‚Äôd know.‚Äù

Dax toggled through filters. The shape stayed. No thermal. No transponder. No return.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there,‚Äù he said finally.

The Rufus K‚Äôs external floods switched on. Twin beams of industrial-grade light stabbed outward, swallowing rock and space dust. At first, the beams seemed to vanish into black. Then they bent.

Light slid along something enormous. It didn‚Äôt reflect;  it flowed, like water over glass, disappearing into the dark. The object drank the illumination and gave nothing back, just the faintest contour where starlight broke against angles too deliberate for chance.

Juno‚Äôs throat tightened. She thought of caverns on Halley‚Äôs Step, where light vanished into stone until your lamp was the only thing keeping the dark from swallowing you whole. This was worse.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not natural,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Dax said. He didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer at once. He was ex-navy, though he never said which fleet, and he carried that air of having already lived through the worst a ship could throw at you. When in doubt, he defaulted to procedure.

‚ÄúMark it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPush it up the chain.‚Äù

Juno hesitated. ‚ÄúWe could tag salvage.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to own that?‚Äù He gestured at the smear in the dark with a raised eyebrow.

Her silence was enough. She tapped the console. The packet went out: coordinates, scans, every scrap of telemetry. Encrypted, stamped, and sealed by systems far above their pay grade.

Ten minutes later the reply came back, tagged with seals Juno had only seen in training vids. High-clearance, Assembly-level. She read it twice to be sure.


>>HOLD POSITION.
MAINTAIN TELEMETRY.
DO NOT APPROACH.<<


Juno felt her stomach lurch. They were two hundred million klicks from the nearest patrol cutter. If anything came out of that smear, no one would reach them before the reactor ran dry.

‚ÄúWe should leave,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe already didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Dax answered.


The others woke to the news with the same mix of disbelief and irritation that marked most of their days.

Rafiq, the chief, grumbled that telemetry work wasn‚Äôt covered in their contract. Alvarez said if it was dangerous, the company probably wouldn't be billing hazard pay. Nobody mentioned the smear directly, not while they were in the same room.

But Juno caught the way each of them, at some point, drifted to the forward viewport and stared too long into the dark. How each one looked away a little too fast, as if they‚Äôd caught their reflection in a coffin lid.

For the next twelve hours, the Rufus K held station. They mapped, they scanned, they pretended the shape wasn‚Äôt looming larger on the scopes. Juno found her eyes drawn back to it again and again. Each time, it looked the same; wrong, silent, waiting.

The Rufus K was not supposed to matter. But now, Juno thought, it might be the last ship in human space to stumble across something truly new.

She wished it had been someone else.



Chapter 2: The Rumor

No one ever figured out who leaked the first image.

Officially, the Rufus K‚Äôs packet went straight from the relay to Assembly archives under a seal thick enough to bury it for decades. The system was supposed to be airtight. But systems were made of people, and people left cracks.

Some said it was a relay tech on Vesta who saw the raw feed and decided to copy a frame to sell on the side. Others swore it was one of the Rufus K‚Äôs crew, trading proof for hazard pay. A popular version on the nets blamed a bored junior analyst on Halley‚Äôs Step who forgot to lock down her console before going to the bathroom.

Whoever it was, the picture spread in hours.

It was a single frame, grainy and washed out in the glare of the Rufus K‚Äôs floods. Against the starfield, a shape curved where nothing should. Not an asteroid. Not a ship anyone recognized. A smudge too straight to be natural, too wrong to be ignored.

It hit the dockside boards first, tucked between union chatter and smuggler gossip. Then it leapt across feeds, faster than the Assembly‚Äôs censors could stamp.

By the end of the week, everyone in the Belt had a name for it: The Bruise.


On Halley‚Äôs Step, the veterans‚Äô hall stank of old tobacco and grease. A dozen ex-navy men hunched around the screen, scarred knuckles tight around glasses.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a weapon,‚Äù said Mikkelson, who‚Äôd flown intercepts in the Jovian War. His eyes had the fever of someone who‚Äôd been waiting years to be proven right. ‚ÄúLook at the structure. It‚Äôs casing. Warhead casing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rock,‚Äù muttered Vasquez. ‚ÄúShadows on a rock.‚Äù

‚ÄúRocks don‚Äôt bend light like that.‚Äù Mikkelson jabbed his finger at the replay. ‚ÄúThis is old tech. Pre-unification. Whoever left it behind wanted us scared.‚Äù

No one agreed, but no one walked away either. They drank and stared at the smear until the screen went black with static.


On Ilyrion, the cathedral bells rang for three days. The High Prelate stood on the steps in his crimson robe, voice amplified across the plaza.

‚ÄúThe sign has come,‚Äù he thundered. ‚ÄúA tomb sent by the ancients, sent against the arrogant and the faithless. We are warned, and we are chosen. The spirits of the past give to us a message! Believe!‚Äù

The faithful wept in the square. Vendors sold cheap icons carved into the shape of a bruise. Pilgrims lit candles for ships they had never seen.


On Vesta Port, dockhands watched the image on repeat while chewing stale protein bars.

‚ÄúCould be a gate,‚Äù one said, spitting crumbs into his hand.

‚ÄúGate to what?‚Äù another laughed.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. Somebody‚Äôs gonna try and open it.‚Äù

They all nodded, grim. Everyone in the port knew how the galaxy worked. If there was a door, someone would pay to walk through first. Or shove someone else through.


On Kovyr Prime, the lawyers got to work.

In a chamber lined with paper archives and stale coffee mugs, clerks pulled old treaties from dusty shelves. Paragraphs written three centuries ago suddenly mattered again: right of salvage, border claims, precedent of discovery.

One judge, a narrow man named Dal Veyr, wrote a fifty-page opinion overnight and blasted it across the legal networks.

> ‚ÄúBy all precedent, the structure; regardless of origin, falls under the status of unclaimed salvage. The first crew to identify and transmit coordinates establishes ownership.‚Äù<

It was dry, technical, and utterly explosive. Within a day, three corporations claimed the Rufus K‚Äôs coordinates had been stolen from their archives.


On New Carthage, the merchants saw only opportunity.

In the glass towers along the equatorial strip, brokers held private dinners, pouring crystal wine while slideshows of the bruise ran in the background.

‚ÄúHow many cubic tons of exotic alloys does that hull represent?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the market value of alien salvage if we frame it as Xeno-materials?‚Äù
‚ÄúImagine the auctions. Governments bidding to own a single panel.‚Äù

They weren‚Äôt talking about discovery. They were talking about margins, about futures, about who would get rich quickest.


For ordinary people, the bruise became a story.

Children drew it in chalk on colony walls. Storytellers in low-orbit bars whispered that it was a graveyard, that it was full of sleeping monsters,  that it was the place where the first explorers disappeared.

Every culture folded it into their own myths. Some saw a warning. Others, a promise. Some called it a test.

The bruise became everything people wanted it to be, except the truth.



The Assembly tried to contain the flood, issuing statements that the image was ‚Äúunauthenticated‚Äù and ‚Äúlikely fabricated.‚Äù But the more they denied, the more the feeds burned.

On message boards, anonymous posters claimed their great-grandparents had already known about the bruise. Others insisted it matched carvings on forgotten worlds. A dozen crackpot prophets announced they had foreseen it in dreams.

The story was out. The bruise was no longer a secret object in the dark. It was an idea, and ideas traveled faster than ships.


In the crew quarters of the Rufus K, Juno scrolled through feed after feed on her cracked slate, sick with the knowledge that the worlds were already running away with what she‚Äôd seen.

She looked at Dax. ‚ÄúWe started this.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, calm as ever. ‚ÄúWe just tripped over it. The rest was always going to happen.‚Äù


By the end of the month, five systems were arguing not about what the bruise was, but who it belonged to.

No one had touched it yet.
No one had seen inside.
No one had asked what it might wake, if it ever stirred.

But already it had a thousand names, a thousand meanings.

The bruise had become a window.

And everyone who looked into it saw only their fears.


Chapter 3: Accord

The Assembly Hall of the Unified Systems was built to inspire awe, and had long since failed at the job.

It sprawled like a glass amphitheater on the rim of Veyra Prime‚Äôs equatorial sea, its domed roof reflecting the sun like an eye that never blinked. Inside, tiers of seats curved toward a central dais. Flags hung in perfect symmetry, a gallery of color that fluttered slightly in the controlled breeze. The acoustics were tuned so that every raised voice carried, which was a design flaw as much as an achievement.

On the morning of the bruise hearings, every seat was filled.

The delegate from Halley‚Äôs Step opened the first volley.

‚ÄúWe cannot allow Kovyr Prime access,‚Äù she declared, her thin hands slicing the air. ‚ÄúThey failed to meet migration quotas last census cycle. They hoard their population, and now they would hoard this discovery as well. It is our right..‚Äù

Kovyr‚Äôs representative, a short man in a flawless suit, cut her off. ‚ÄúYour right? You mean your claim. Halley‚Äôs Step has been in arrears for war reparation tithes for two generations. You still owe blood money from the Jovian War. And yet you posture as custodians of humanity‚Äôs possible future?‚Äù

The chamber erupted.

Delegates stood, shouted, pointed fingers. Someone banged a ceremonial staff against the floor to no effect. The speaker tried to gavel order and gave up.

From the Ilyrion bloc, Cardinal Sava rose in his scarlet robes. ‚ÄúThis is not property! This is revelation. A sign! It belongs not to commerce nor conquest, but to the faithful. To seize it for salvage is sacrilege.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour faith,‚Äù sneered a Vesta Port magnate, ‚Äúnot mine. The Assembly is secular. We don‚Äôt hand miracles to bishops like trinkets.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already do,‚Äù the Cardinal replied. ‚ÄúYou call them tithes instead of offerings.‚Äù

Laughter, bitter and sharp, rolled across the hall.


By the second day, the arguments had stratified into familiar trenches.

Halley‚Äôs Step claimed first rights as frontier defense.
Kovyr Prime demanded salvage precedent.
Ilyrion invoked heritage.
Vesta Port shouted industrial necessity.
New Carthage insisted only they had the logistics to support long-term study.

Every speech dragged up old wounds. Border disputes. Trade embargoes. The time one world had ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù shut down another‚Äôs data relays. Nobody mentioned the bruise itself, not really. The object in the dark was a prize, a mirror in which they saw only their grudges.


On the third evening, someone whispered the word Accord.

It had been used before, centuries earlier, to end a war no one wanted to remember. A word heavy with compromise and exhaustion.

The delegates clung to it like a life raft.

The draft Accord was simple enough, no single world would claim the bruise. A joint mission would be formed, governed by Assembly oversight. Crew drawn proportionally from each signatory. No salvage without consensus. No access without quorum.

It was less a decision than the absence of one.

The vote passed not because anyone believed it, but because no one wanted to be the one to walk out.

The press releases called it unity. The delegates called it survival.


Then came the practical arguments.

‚ÄúWhat vessel shall we use?‚Äù asked the Speaker.

Immediately, every bloc shouted a candidate. Kovyr offered a carrier. Halley‚Äôs Step, a frigate. New Carthage, a luxury surveyor dressed up as science.

None could be agreed upon. Old suspicions ran too deep. No one wanted their rival‚Äôs ship to set the precedent.

After hours of deadlock, they chose a cutter from the Assembly‚Äôs own neglected fleet, the Ocelot, a survey vessel kept in reserve for diplomatic junkets and forgotten after. Too small to threaten, too large to dismiss.

No one liked it. That made it perfect.

Uniforms were next.

Each bloc had proposals. Halley‚Äôs Step wanted dark blue, ‚Äúfor tradition.‚Äù Vesta demanded orange striping for visibility. Ilyrion insisted on insignia bearing a star and flame.

They argued for two days. In the end, they settled on a grey no one liked, with patches that were simple, circular, with the word ACCORD around the rim. Inside was an abstract curve meant to suggest unity.

To some, it looked like an open hand.
To others, the bruise.


When the crew lists were announced, tension ran cold and sharp.

From Halley‚Äôs Step: Lieutenant Kade Mercer, war-scarred and taciturn.
From Kovyr Prime: Mara Kovacs, engineer, sharp as broken glass.
From Ilyrion: Dr. Tam Asher, historian, fluent in more dead dialects than living friends.
From New Carthage: Jalen Forbes and Vance Taylor. two policy officers, both trained to smile while stabbing. 
From Vesta: Avela Kumar, logistics and quartermaster Connor O‚ÄôDrea, who distrusted everyone.
From Assembly command: Captain Rhee, chosen because she had never belonged anywhere long enough to make enemies.

They gathered aboard the Ocelot in stiff silence, the patches stark against their grey sleeves.

No one said it aloud, but each of them knew; they weren‚Äôt explorers. They were hostages to each other‚Äôs pride.

The bruise drifted in darkness, patient.
The Ocelot burned toward it, carrying six worlds worth of grudges in her hull.

Unity, the press releases called it.

The crew knew better.

The spinning usually lasts for up to 10-15secs. Never felt this before and it gave me some panic attacks which led to bloating. Now I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to have another episode so I do have anxiety a little more than usual now.

Up to this point I‚Äôve been feeling unbalanced for a couple of years. When I walk it feels like I‚Äôm walking on uneven surfaces like stepping on/off a slightly raised lump on the floor. I would walk around my house trying to find out what triggers it. Certain head movements would trigger quick, sudden dizziness (non-spinning). Some stores and lighting also trigger intensified unbalanced. I was drinking caffeine quite a bit (sugary coffee or energy drink 3-4 times a week). 

I noticed I wouldn‚Äôt feel unbalanced when I would run I also noticed when I would walk with my hands clasped behind my back that it would also help me feel less unbalanced or most times completely get rid of it. This made me believe it could be a posture issue. The past several months I have been doing a lot of sitting and on my phone a lot which I know brings my neck down and forward.

I went to the doctor today for the first time, he believes it could be a combination of things, high blood pressure, inner ear issues, anxiety/stress, overdue on eye prescription but I do believe it‚Äôs postural.

Just want to put my story out incase it closely relates to someone going through something similar.

I just finished mine, completely solo, in 3 days, for $1,500 total and I thought it might be useful to share how.

**Quick result**  
My campaign launched a week ago and it‚Äôs already 185% funded. Here‚Äôs what I think worked best for me:

**Why I kept it lean**  
The campaign itself isn‚Äôt huge, so dropping $5K+ on a video didn‚Äôt make sense. I wanted something polished enough to build trust with backers but light enough on the wallet to keep funds focused on production.

**My gear setup**

* Rented DSLR + 2 lenses (variety for wide + tight shots).
* Hohem isteady v3 ultra gimbal. It smoothed out shots and even let me pre-program camera moves so I could fake a second cameraman while being in front of the camera myself.

**Rentals + accessories**¬†$900: Music license + motion graphics pack. $250: Editing software subscription (Premiere Pro + After Effects). $150: Misc (props, delivery fees, etc.). $200: Food/coffee for 3 straight days of shooting.

**Planning & filming:**

* Scripted in a 2-column doc (voiceover vs visuals) this saved me rental days. 90% was filmed in my condo.
* Shallow depth of field made boring rooms look cinematic.
* Hohem‚Äôs motion path features made it look like a crew was operating the camera when it was just me. Editing & polish Background track set the pace (royalty free). Learned quick tricks from YouTube tutorials (motion tracking titles, color correction).
* Editing took another 2 days but I kept costs low by doing it all myself.

**Why I think this worked**

The end result isn‚Äôt Hollywood but it looks professional enough for Kickstarter standards and it gave me the confidence to launch without burning cash before the campaign even started. Most production houses quoted me $3,000‚Äì$7,000 for a similar video. By going DIY, I kept it at $1,500. For me, that‚Äôs what minimum viable production looks like.

TL;DR: Shot my Kickstarter video solo in 3 days for $1,500. Campaign is already 185% funded.

Him - early riser, loves an adventure, loves beer more, a bit introverted, eyerolls at pretentious vibes or prices, and easily bored at the beach.

1nzvbni,https://i.redd.it/3bkkapeb2ktf1.png,I built AwakeSync ‚Äî a smart HomeKit alarm that wakes you with light during light sleep stages,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm the developer of¬†[AwakeSync](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/awakesync/id6466740367), a smart alarm app for¬†Apple Watch¬†designed to give you the most natural wake-up possible.

What makes AwakeSync special is that it can¬†**control your HomeKit devices**. With it your lights, shades, or other accessories can help wake you¬†gently¬†when you‚Äôre in a light sleep stage.

AwakeSync monitors your sleep within a chosen wake window and¬†wakes you when it detects light sleep.

With the newest update, it can now¬†**finally control HomeKit devices** even while running in the background. That means your¬†lights can turn on or your shades can open¬†*before*¬†the vibration alarm starts, using light alone to help you wake up naturally (or start your coffee machine in time).

You can¬†try AwakeSync **for free** for a few days, and if you like it, there‚Äôs a¬†**one-time lifetime** unlock. No subscriptions, no ads, and¬†no data collection¬†‚Äî everything runs privately on your Watch.

FAQ

**Do I need to have the app open to use it?**

No, you can close the app. Once you set up your alarms, you never have to open the app again. It will do everything automatically in the background

**Will it drain my battery?**

Not at all. It only activates during your wake window, using an optimized on-device machine learning model.

**Do I need my iPhone nearby?**

No. AwakeSync runs entirely on your Apple Watch, your phone can even be off.

**What if I don‚Äôt hit a light sleep stage?**

If no light sleep is detected, AwakeSync will still wake you at the end of your window. It can also¬†*nudge* you (gently tap your wrist) in the final minutes¬†to help transition out of deep sleep.

**Is only HomeKit supported?**

No. AwakeSync has native integration for HomeKit and Home Assistant. All other plattforms that support a Rest-API can also be controlled",15,1759784532.0,HomeKit,1,0.95,False

Ezekiel took me home, still a bit tipsy from the beers we had but the painting of the girl I was tasked to think into existence clutched in my hands. When we arrived at the door together I got a good look at my mom. Guilt overwhelmed me when I saw she clutched a used tissue in hand, had a stray ketchup covered Mac and cheese noodle from my temper tantrum still embedded in her dress and just how much crimson was in her eyes. She didn‚Äôt have a single harsh word to say. Instead, she just took me into her embrace and apologized for grounding me. nImmediately after, she asked me not to leave her again and I agreed.¬† I now had something that made me want to stay home. To make it up to her I made her dinner. Nothing much, just some frozen dino nuggets I put in the oven alongside pizza rolls. We ate those and watched shows she liked until she fell asleep on the couch.¬†

The moment her eyes shut I raced upstairs, the painting in tow. Once in my room I saw that my mother had cleaned the mess I made of my posters. Even as shame hit me for losing all of them it was still fortunate for me, for exactly where my Revenge of the Sith poster once stood was now laid bare and a perfect spot for Her. Carefully, I put Her in that place, securing the painting with pins, and laid in my bed. Her visage was now perfectly positioned so that as I laid back against my pillows and looked at her, she stared directly back at me.¬†

I took in Her entirety then, doing as my Uncle had instructed. Given she was modeled after someone that had touched me that night, it wasn‚Äôt hard. I thought of Her peeling from the paper, how it would be as she walked around my room, how she would sound, how she would smell. Ezekiel was right about the physical part too. Knowing that it was my blood that made the streaks of Her hair red, that the black of Her lips was infused with lipstick that had touched my forehead worked wonders for my imagination. It made it all the easier to see that two dimensional scene girl stepping off as my three dimensional princess.¬†

Trying as hard as I could to fight exhaustion, I was still awake just as the earliest twilight rays started to make their way through my window. I hadn‚Äôt seen any results yet, but Ezekiel had said this wouldn‚Äôt be an instant process. Eventually, my fatigue overwhelmed my infatuation, and I drifted off. I can‚Äôt say for certain if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me or if it really did begin that night, but I remember that just before sleep took me the faintest shadow stirred on the canvas.

Over the next few weeks I began to see more glimmers of Her. They came in the form of the corner of my room looking darker than it should, the faintest flicker of movement behind my desk, seeing the mattress dip even when no one sat on it. Even then I told myself it was tricks of the light, or me running on too much code red Mountain Dew, but deep down I wanted it to be Her. So I continued forward, every night staring at my painting, willing everything I wanted to manifest into reality.¬†

I found that if you stare long enough, the dark begins to stare back. And pretty soon, It wasn‚Äôt just sight either. Sometimes I could smell something faint, like smoke after a match is blown out, or that sweet chemical scent of lip gloss hanging in the air. After that it was sound. I‚Äôd be sitting at my computer and swear I heard a whisper, just half a breath too soft to make out, like the headset was still on. Through all of it I spent every night staring into Her painting, tracing every detail, thinking of Her as already in the room with me now.

One night I decided to stop pretending. The corner by my closet looked darker than it should, nearly six feet tall, thin but with light curves. When I traced the entirety of it, I simply couldn‚Äôt deny what I was looking at. The shape was near identical to the silhouette of the painting only it shifted just ever so slightly at the edges. Staring into it I felt Her name press against the inside of my skull. The name I had chosen, the one Ezekiel told me never to say. I thought it hard, burning it into Her shape without saying a word. Minutes slipped by like that, the room in total silence as I just etched the thought of Her name into that shadow.¬†

A soft and sweet voice cut through the quiet like a knife, and it was a voice I already knew. ‚ÄúWhy do you keep on staring at me like that?‚Äù

I froze, every hair on my body standing on end, my jaw slack, nothing but ‚Äúuhh‚Äù to say in reply.

The shadow swelled and became more defined, and I could see now the sharp jutting ends of darkness that mirrored Her teased hair. She spoke again, softly ‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe that I met Her first words with nothing but shock, and even though she was right, that this terrified me, I tried my best to save the moment, ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs so awesome to hear you speak that I forgot how to talk.‚Äù

The shadow girl giggled at that, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cute!‚Äù

Feeling confident, I followed quickly with, ‚ÄúNo, you are the one who is cute here.‚Äù

Just as I said those words I saw the briefest flash, bright blue eyes against the shadows. There were no further words exchanged, but the dark seemed to soften and move, like she bent closer towards me. I continued staring at Her, and she looked back until eventually I just passed out. I fell asleep smiling which wasn‚Äôt something I did much then and never do now.

After that she became a regular thing. I started to expect Her presence with me and I treated Her like she was always there, whether I saw Her or not. When I ate, I left space across the table like she might want a plate. When I played Halo I told Her about my kill streaks, like she was on the couch cheering me on. I imagined Her honeyed laughter whenever I‚Äôd do my imitation of the announcer. My mom noticed I was talking more, sometimes glancing at the empty chair at the dining table, but she never mentioned anything about it. She just let me live in my own world with the imaginary girl, probably afraid of another confrontation with me.

At the end of every day when I retired to my room she was there and she grew bolder. It wasn‚Äôt just the corners of my room anymore. Now she was able to stand on Her own. I remember the first time I opened the door and saw Her tall dark form waiting for me in the middle of my room, Her presence clear against the dim moonlight, a shimmer in the cool air of night. More than just eyes showed. I could see a head of teased hair, the angles of Her face, and long legs ending in blocky boots. I could almost make out the bracelets at her wrists, a faint glint against the starlight.¬†

I kept Ezekiel aware of Her, talking to him regularly of the developments. He was as eager as I was on the whole affair, but I kept things as clinical as I could. I told him of how she was growing, how she became more detailed, that we now had conversations. I never told him of the feelings I was developing for Her, and how much I longed for Her. He probably would‚Äôve stopped me then, knowing I was beginning to cross lines I was never supposed to.

About three months had passed since the concert and by now we spoke every night, sometimes until dawn. Once it was late and my Mom had fallen asleep on the couch again. I slipped upstairs, shut my door, and lay down, waiting for her presence. This time though, I was awake for hours without even a hint of Her. Eventually, exhaustion overwhelmed worry, and I began to feel my eyes grow heavier. I was half asleep when I felt it. I woke from the press of weight against the end of my mattress. Bolting up from my sheets I saw Her. Not just a smear in the corner. Not just a darker patch of air. Her.

She wasn‚Äôt shadow, she wasn‚Äôt outline. She was there. I could see every detail. I could see Her platform boots planted firmly on my carpet. Her legs, long and pale. Her arms, thin and covered in bracelets. Her lips, black and glossy. The only thing that indicated she was anything other than human was just the slightest bit of translucence, and Her eyes. They glowed with pale blue light behind the pupils. She didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt breathe, but I knew she was looking right at me as that brightness bore into my soul. Her voice came, soft and close, and the exchange that flowed between us were rapid and fateful.¬†

‚ÄúMalachi, did you fall asleep on me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMeaning like as a friend, or meaning like that you like-like me?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, like.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you be my girlfriend? Please please please?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even think. I didn‚Äôt even draw breath between words. I just begged Her, not giving one damn about what Ezekiel had told me because I loved her and I wanted desperately for Her to love me that same way. When I finished with my final please, she said nothing. Instead, she slid across my mattress, took my head in Her hands, hands that held no human warmth but yet had real weight and feel to them. She held me like that for an unending second, Her eyes boring straight into mine, no expression crossing her face. Then, she pulled my face into Hers, and kissed me.

Her mouth stayed on mine until my lungs burned and I was forced to withdraw. It felt so different than the kiss with the real girl, which was warm, wet and human. This time I only felt the cool press of gloss and the thinnest tang, like the taste of pennies. When she drew back I realized Her eyes had been open the entire time. Staring long at Her afterwards, I realized she didn‚Äôt blink. Ever. The blue under Her pupils pulsed once, steady as a siren.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to be your girlfriend. But Malachi, what's your girlfriend's name? She doesn‚Äôt even know it herself.‚Äù she whispered back with a pout, eyes now glowing so bright it almost hurt to look.

I swallowed, and said, ‚ÄúUhm, I can‚Äôt tell you what it is right now, beautiful. That‚Äôs just how things work with you. I‚Äôm sorry, but maybe someday I can.‚Äù

The smile she had faded, eyes dimming, ‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs okay I guess. When you‚Äôre ready, you just tell me, and I‚Äôll be waiting for when someday turns into today, boyfriend.‚Äù

I have no idea how I kept myself from folding there, perhaps it was just the strangeness of it all. Even if I failed immediately on keeping myself from agreeing to a romantic relationship at the slightest pressure, the sheer want she held to know what Her name was shocked me into my senses. Still, I was overwhelmed with an intoxicating mixture of fear from breaking a rule and desire for what could come out of that. Her smile returned soon, and she moved in closer to me. She placed a hand to my chest, and I felt the force of it push me down into my bed. She slid in alongside me, sharing a pillow with mine.

‚ÄúWould you be okay if I stayed here with you, while you slept?‚Äù She asked, sweetness returning to Her voice.

I looked back trembling, ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôd love that.‚Äù

And so she did. And she did that every night from then on out. Kissing, touching, speaking to me about my day. We‚Äôd talk about schoolwork, the games I played, and then she would ask me for Her name. Every time, I denied her. Every time, she would then lay down beside me. She never slept though. Whenever I would wake up at night I‚Äôd find Her glowing, unbreakable gaze upon me still. In the morning she was always gone. I never asked where she went, I was afraid of what doors that might open up. And even as I loved Her, I feared Her. She gave me companionship but she never gave me warmth. Not in touch, not in Her words, not in Her gaze. All of it was cold. Ezekiel had told me she would be hungry, but I thought that was only for my imagination. She didn‚Äôt just eat what my mind gave Her, but consumed my body heat itself.

Perhaps that was what led me to finally confront my mother on my academics. That summer when I had finished my homeschooling, I told Her that I wanted to take my classes at Santa Clara University in person rather than online. It took some convincing, but eventually she relented. She even bought me a car, an old Camry, so that I could commute. Part of me was glad just to finally have that win, to be able to try to be normal. But I couldn‚Äôt deny that I simply just wanted the chance to be away from Her presence. She was there with me every night. As the days faded I produced less heat for myself, to the point I was shivering under sherpa blankets in the middle of summer.

When I finally started college that fall, I found friends that fit me. Devout gamers with bad posture and ardent opinions about the most meaningless things. We split pizza, argued patch notes, and carried our consoles to each other's homes like relics. I spent those nights away from my bed on friends' couches, and she never came to see me there. And even just that one night of reprieve let me be warm once again. I‚Äôd leave and be back to normal. Beyond that, I really was just becoming more normal. Being around guys, even gamers, got me to learn how to speak like an actual human being.¬†

It made me think that just a little separation every now and then could make it all work out with Her. Of course, whenever I got back she was always annoyed, always jealous, always implying that I was doing something wrong. It would take a bit, but eventually she would be reassured, and we would go back to our nightly ritual. I would fall asleep, and she would stare at me with an icy glow. And every day that passed between my last sleepover I felt that cold seep into me once more. As it went on I would seek reprieve more and more often, and she would become more strained.

It was now the end of my freshman year in college, just before the summer after our finals and this was the first time I was going to be taking back to back weekends away from her. I was getting ready to go to Jonathan's house, who was both my best and most well adjusted friend I‚Äôd made. I threw on some graphic tee I got at Tillys and a striped button down I left open over that, skinny jeans and some vans. I brushed my hair, long and swept to the side and I took a good look at myself in the mirror. It was remarkable how much different I looked now from that concert a year ago.¬†

I remember getting a good look at myself, and just how good I felt, replaced in an instant by the shock of cold as two ghostly transparent ghostly bracelet clad arms appeared, wrapped around my midsection. From behind my head Her face titled into view, Her pale blue eyes ringed in black staring back at mine in the mirror, peaking through red and black streaked bangs. She pressed her glossy lips to my ear, and I felt an electric tingle as she kissed me.

She whispered, ‚Äúyou look so good babe. All dressed up for me?‚Äù

I realized I hadn‚Äôt told Her my plans for the weekend, something she always wanted from me beforehand, and all I gave Her was a simple, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She scowled at me and I winced as Her hug turned to a squeeze. ‚ÄúThen who for?‚Äù

‚ÄúJonathan invited me over. He rented Tropic Thunder from Blockbuster. I‚Äôm going to watch that.‚Äù I said, meeting her gaze and standing firm even as my body began to hurt from her touch.

She held my gaze, searching my eyes for any sign of lies. I met Her back and we held a staring contest through the mirror, waiting to see who broke first.¬†

She did. ‚ÄúFine. Go.‚Äù

I was released from her grip then and as she turned to walk away I spoke earnestly, ‚ÄúI love you but sometimes I just need a-‚Äù

She had vanished. Gone, entirely. Our relationship was becoming more frayed, more strained. I knew I had to do something to fix it soon. I considered Ezekiel's offer, that if things got worse he could fix things. But, there was that other part to it, that he would end Her if things were too bad. I didn‚Äôt want to treat her like a pet that needed to be put down. She was my girlfriend, and I figured it was my responsibility to mend the relationship. I resolved to do that, as soon as I got done with hanging out with my friend and a bit of relaxation. I tried my best to just forget everything with Her and enjoy the night.¬†

I arrived at Jonathan's apartment not long after. After a few knocks on the door it swung open to reveal a tall guy with blonde spiked hair, blue polo with the collar popped, and a coors light in hand. By far Jonathan was the best socially adjusted of all my friends, and had also done the most to try and get me out of my shell. He had given me fashion advice, was honest with me when I was being too weird and generally just helped me be normal.

‚ÄùGlad you could make it over bro. Here.‚Äù He said, passing me the coors in his hand as we walked inside. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get in some brews and some COD, my treat.‚Äù

I cracked the top of the can and took a sip as I took in the apartment surroundings. A couple beat up couches picked up off the side of the road, a scuffed IKEA coffee table, and no decorations except for a California state flag pinned up on one wall and a 49ers banner on the other. The real centerpiece, the draw for his whole pad, was the 50 inch pioneer Kuro TV his parents got him as a college gift. It cost thousands, but it was worth it for him to have the best place to watch movies and play games around.¬†

As I plopped onto the couch, took my beer in one hand and a controller in the other, Jonathan spoke. ‚ÄúBy the way, Vanessa's coming over for the movie in a couple hours. Why don‚Äôt you invite your girl over too?‚Äù

I sighed, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many times I have to tell you this Jon, she‚Äôs just really introverted. Plus, things aren‚Äôt going so hot right now.‚Äù\
He raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúOh, so are you about to break up with your imaginary girlfriend and get back into the very real dating market? All our hot coeds finally get you to stop pretending?‚Äù

I was shocked, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean imaginary? She‚Äôs very real man, and we are going through real relationship issues I intend to work through.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, okay. Yeah, the real girlfriend that I‚Äôve never even seen a picture of. Here‚Äôs my girlfriend Mal.‚Äù He said, as he flipped out his motorolla razr and showed me the background, a picture of a very cute blonde giving him a kiss as he had a massive grin. ‚ÄúCan you do that, show me just like, one photo of the two of you.‚Äù\
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like taking photos.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, she‚Äôs just camera shy. Or maybe she‚Äôs a vampire, can‚Äôt be photographed or have a reflection or whatever. Is that it, is she just a mythical creature, not imaginary?‚Äù

I paused at this, as that was far closer to the truth. ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs just a girl I started dating in high school.‚Äù

‚ÄúMal, you were homeschooled. Are you telling me you‚Äôre dating your sister now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not dating my sister, or a vampire, or someone imaginary. I have a girlfriend!‚Äù I was starting to get heated with him at this point. Why couldn‚Äôt he just leave this alone?

Jon was taken back by this, ‚ÄúMal, you‚Äôre my bro for life. I want nothing but the best for you, and surely you can trust me enough with this. Can you just tell me the name of your mystery girl?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\
‚ÄúCome on man, just her name! Just say it!‚Äù\
‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not allowed to.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot allowed, what the hell are you talking about man? Is she holding you hostage? Does she have you on a wire right now, is she listening to your every word? Just tell me her name bro.‚Äù

I considered that. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to tell Her what Her name was. But she wasn‚Äôt here with me now, and maybe that would get him to lay off me, and we could just chill with our beer and games. I swallowed, and readied myself to bend a rule.

‚ÄúOkay, her name is \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_.‚Äù

And I said it. For the first time I spoke Her name out loud. I almost thought something would happen then, like thunder would boom, the lights would go out, and she would appear right there with me. But nothing happened. Nothing, except roaring laughter from Jonathan.

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs ‚Äòher‚Äô name? Are you gay Mal? It‚Äôs okay if you are, I have gay friends, it‚Äôs 2009 after all.‚Äù

I was taken back by that. Had I really given her a boy's name? ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not gay, and that‚Äôs just her name. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, well does she have a last name?‚Äù

I thought I was done with this, and I had no good answer to that. I was frozen for a good while there, just racking my brain for anything. Maybe it was just how exhausting his questioning had become, but I just couldn‚Äôt think of anything at all to make up on the spot.

‚ÄúNo, she just has the one name.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the one name. Okay. Mal, can you just admit you don‚Äôt actually have a girlfriend? The truth will set you free.‚Äù

Once again, I considered his words. There was truth to them I could actually admit to. ‚ÄúYeah, to be honest, I made her up. I was really lonely, and I just fabricated her out of nothing. And the idea of her kept me company when I had nothing. But now, I‚Äôm just not too sure how much I want to keep living with her in my shadow.‚Äù And that was relieving to finally say, because I meant every word.

Jonathan clasped a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI know that hurt to say but I did this for you bro, just like I helped you finally learn to dress right and stop talking so much like a geek. It‚Äôs because I care about you. When I say bro, it really is like you‚Äôre my little bro, bro. And tonight, I wanted you to admit this because I set up something for you I think you‚Äôre going to like.‚Äù

He stopped for a moment, and pulled his phone out again. He clicked the buttons a few times, then pulled up the screen again to show me. This time, it was a picture of Vanessa next to another girl. She was shorter, a bit chubby, with long black hair that had streaks of teal in it. She had on a gir hoodie, spiked bracelets, and purple lipstick alongside enough eyeliner to make her look like a racoon. She wasn‚Äôt as pretty as Her, but she had something that I realized I wanted more. She would be warm, where the other girl was cold. She was real, and I wanted her.

Jonathan spoke then, ‚ÄúHer name‚Äôs Lila, and she‚Äôs coming tonight. I already had Vanessa show her your picture. You know what she said?‚Äù

I swallowed, and asked nervously, ‚ÄúWhat did she say.‚Äù\
‚Äú‚ÄòHe‚Äôs cute. I like him already.‚Äô What do you say bro?‚Äù Jonathan said.

I didn‚Äôt even hesitate. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôd like to meet her. Tell Vanessa to bring her over.‚Äù

Jonathan had the biggest grin I‚Äôd seen as he whooped, ‚ÄúHell yeah, that's legit! Alright Mal, lets see how far we can get in Verruckt before the chicks get here.‚Äù

Three beers and 22 rounds on a split screen later we heard a knock at the door. Jon and I looked at each other, and reluctantly ended our so far solid run. Ultimately, we both put girls over gaming now. Jonathan stood, but as I began to get up as well he stopped me.

‚ÄúWait here, I‚Äôll go get them. It‚Äôll be weird if you stand behind me. Waiting on the couch shows you aren‚Äôt too eager. Chicks dig that Mal. Oh, and good luck.‚Äù He winked, and then went towards the entrance of the apartment. I watched as the door opened and a cute tall blonde threw her arms around Jonathan and gave him a kiss.¬†

Just behind her was Lila. A shorter girl, but still quite cute in her own right, and prettier in person than in the picture. Calmly, she started to walk towards me, her doc martens audibly hitting the vinyl floor. On her way over she batted her eyes, thick eyelashes fluttering at me. Before sitting beside me she slipped off the sweatshirt she was wearing, and my heart began to pound as I saw she wore a cut off twilight T-shirt that exposed her midriff. Inching closer to me on the couch, she turned to me, and finally spoke.

‚ÄúYou must be Mal. You‚Äôre even cuter in person.‚Äù

I was blown away by just how forward she was. It took me a second to gather myself before replying, ‚ÄúYou must be Lila. You‚Äôre gorgeous.‚Äù

She giggled at that, then suddenly moved in to kiss me. I felt her lips make contact with mine and I met her back fiercely. Jonathan and Vanessa made some comments about us as they took notice but I didn‚Äôt remember or care what he had to say. I was too infatuated in the moment, too electrified, too happy to realize just how much I really wanted this. How simple just a warm body pressed into yours could be so much better than any facsimile. That was initially the reason why I can‚Äôt remember what happened. The other, is that just after we finished kissing, I felt an icy chill creep up the back of my spine. It was the same cold creep that Her touch gave me.¬†

Over a year ago, I had a horrible experience with mushrooms(my first and only time). I of course decided to eat a lot. It started off great and then I had the best idea to eat even MORE and drink a twisted tea and things quickly went downhill. I was doing my makeup in the mirror and started hallucinating- my eyes and teeth kept growing/shrinking and my hands looked weird and it just freaked me out. Everything around me looked ‚Äúnot right‚Äù and not like my house. So at this point I puked in the toilet and hallucinated that it looked like coffee grounds so I was convinced I was dying and it was straight downhill from there. It was the worst time of my life so difficult to explain!

Anyways, my issue is this was a year ago and I‚Äôm still struggling from it which is really affecting my life. Im dissociating almost daily and struggling with derealization/depersonalization. Immediately after I also quit drinking and smoking weed although I still use nicotine off and on. I‚Äôm in therapy, have tried EMDR, have tried Zoloft (switched to Cymbalta now) and I still don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù or back to how I was. Since I did it at home my house can even trigger a panic attack. I had anxiety as a child but not like this. I just can‚Äôt get that bad trip out of the back of my mind. My therapist says I have OCD and that‚Äôs why it was so bad for me because I wasn‚Äôt in control and I have a need to always be in control. Before my trip I was a very happy person with no anxiety and I was excited about life. Now I have agoraphobia and am depressed most of the time- life feels meaningless since I have to walk around with this ball of anxiety everyday. The dissociating part is terrifying. Everything feels like a dream. Any advice would be really appreciated because I have truthfully tried everything and I‚Äôm at a loss at this point",2,1759784290.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I have taken it apart and repaired steam/condensation leaks in the past when it was tripping the GFCI and fixed the flow meter. So, I‚Äôve been inside this thing a fair bit. Now it‚Äôs tripping the GFCI as soon as it‚Äôs plugged in. I took it apart and left it open for 2 days to dry out and it still trips as soon as I plug it in. So, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs moisture from a leak inside. I used a multimeter to test the boiler and solenoids and here is what the results were. I need help to determine if the boiler or solenoids are bad or if it may be something else. 

Boiler tested at 9.8 ohms. I tested it in two spots and it was the same. I tested the solenoids and they were both like 571 ohms. Not sure if either of these values are good or bad. I also tested the thermal switch that is on top of the boiler and it was basically zero ohms. I tried to get pics of where I placed the probes to test each component but getting it all in the frame with one hand was challenging. 

Did I test things correctly? Do these results identify the issue? Should I test something else? Any other ideas? Appreciate the help so I can stop spending $15 a day on coffee! If I can get the issue solved I will try and make a repair video for YouTube. I have 2 uploaded already.

1nzv4tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nzv4tq/the_bloody_boot_barron_part_1/,The Bloody Boot Barron (Part 1),"When I was young, around nine or ten, there was an old urban legend that passed around the playgrounds in my small town. It was basically about the ‚ÄòBloody Boot Barron‚Äô who would come in the night and bloody his boots on anyone he could find. I remember snickering about it every time I told a kid who had never heard it before.¬†

‚ÄúHe does‚Ä¶.what?‚Äù¬†

Was all this new transfer student, Mikey, could muster upon hearing me reach the last parts of a story I completely made up about the Barron.

‚ÄúYeah. And then he stomps ya until his boots are all red with your bloooood.‚Äù

His face contorted in the middle of my sentence, the end to a story I had completely made up about this ghost. His eyes were wide like he was staring at a dead body as his mouth tightened into the deepest frown I had ever seen. I would never forget it because most kids our age had either already heard every scary campfire story about the Barron, or didn‚Äôt believe it when it first reached their ears. Mikey seemed to hang on my every word.¬†

‚ÄúH-Have you ever seen him?‚Äù

He asked with baited breath, his chest heaving as he struggled to provide his brain with enough oxygen to not pass out right there.

‚ÄúOhhhhh yea, and when I did, I told him to screw off. Haven't seen him since.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah right! Stop messing with me Allan!‚Äù

He had snapped out of his hyperventilation as I spoke. I remember hoping he would buy that part like he bought the rest of my stupid tale. I hoped that if he believed a story about a man visiting your house in the middle of the night to stomp you and your family to death that he would be gullible enough to believe I had encountered it before. Hope in one hand and crap in the other, I guess.

‚ÄúNo! I literallyy fought him off with my skills.‚Äù

I began making karate chop motions as we stood outside our school, where most kids waited for their parents to pick them up. At this point he was completely bought out of the entire story.¬†

‚ÄúWhatever. Hey, do you walk too?‚Äù

He asked as he tightened a hand around one of his backpack straps that had previously been slipping off the slope of his shoulder as he stood straight, no longer enthralled by my tale. I stopped my Kill Bill impersonations and did the same to secure my bag on my back.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, actually. Which way do you go?‚Äù

He pointed behind me towards my street, and I grew excited because I didn‚Äôt really have a lot of friends at the time to be honest. I loved messing with people too much and most didn‚Äôt find it funny. I guess Mikey didn‚Äôt mind one bit.

‚ÄúSame! Let‚Äôs walk together so the bloody boot-‚Äù

""You can‚Äôt get me with that again. I already know you made it all up.‚Äù

He said as his face showed how sick he was of my antics. I didn‚Äôt want to test my luck, so I let my smile temporarily disappear as I tried my best not to bring the barron up again on our entire walk. I just couldn‚Äôt get over his initial reaction, but I suppose I would never be able to capture that kind of lightning in a bottle ever again.¬†

It turned out we lived on the same street, his house was the one I had seen moving vans outside of a few houses down and across the street last week, before school started. On the short walk we talked about what kind of video games we were into, his mom had just gotten him Crash Bandicoot, and my dad was renting me one of the original Ghost Recon games at the time. We talked about bringing our PlayStations over to each other's houses to play together and then parted ways at my house as it came up. I waved him goodbye.

My dad worked late most days, so since school started up I had been letting myself in with a spare key he left for me under a rock near our front door. I probably would‚Äôve been doing it sooner if I stepped outside at all during the summer, but I enjoyed spending my time with video games and TV. My mom was never present in my life, and my dad never really liked to talk about it. Anytime I brought her up he would wave me off and reach for the fridge to grab one of his ‚Äúspecial drinks‚Äù.¬†

I would usually have started up the TV after finishing my homework and grabbing a snack, but on the same day I made my first friend, I found an interesting-looking book waiting for me on the coffee table. Figured my dad had gotten it for me so I wouldn‚Äôt spend so much time in front of the TV anymore. Looking back though, it was such a short book so that theory didn‚Äôt make much sense. It was two pages enclosed between a hard cover that was a dark brown leather, front and back. The thing that really caught my attention at the time though, was the symbol on the front. It was a red symbol that looked like six triangles stacked in a pyramid formation. The book itself wasn‚Äôt thick, but still large. Shaped like a kids' book in a large square, as though it was making room for pictures to paint the pages that it contained.¬†

Upon opening the book, I was greeted with the first page, mostly blank with only a few lines of words. I will never forget what they said because they became my mantra to torment Mikey for the coming years.¬†

>*The Barron comes, just wait and see.*

>*He comes for all who know of he.*

>*He paints the walls, he paints the floors.*

>*He paints his boots with blood and more.*

>*Pay the price when he comes at night.*

>*Or you‚Äôll pay with more than just your life.*

Upon turning the page, I was greeted with a rough-looking sketch of a man's smiling face. He was bearded and donned an old fancy-looking hat that covered his eyes. It kinda creeped me out upon seeing it for the first time, so I slammed the book shut and placed it back on the table where I found it before walking towards the TV where I plopped down in front of it and turned it on. I pretty much sat there watching cartoons until my dad came home.¬†

‚ÄúHey buddy, how was school?‚Äù

He entered the house and spoke as he shut the door and locked it behind him. He placed his keys in the bowl on a stand near the door, then stood waiting for my response. My neck craned backwards so I would face him and I smiled as I barked my response.¬†

‚ÄúIt was great! I made friends with the kid who just moved in down the street, and I got to trick him with the Barron story!‚Äù

My dad's smile disappeared as his eyes sank and left my contact. He sauntered towards the kitchen as he removed his coat and draped it over his Lay-Z-Boy recliner next to the couch. He didn‚Äôt utter another word as he left the room and I heard the fridge open and close. I decided to stand up and yell to him from the living room, hoping I hadn‚Äôt completely ruined his mood in some way.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ and what's with this book you got me?‚Äù

I semi-shouted as I stood there. I heard the sort of crack a soda can makes when opened and had to wait a few seconds before he responded.

‚ÄúWhat book?‚Äù

My eyes darted to the coffee table I had found and left it on but it was nowhere to be seen. My confusion compiled as I struggled to think of when I had moved it. I had gotten up to go pee maybe twice since I got home and one of those times was before I read the book and sat myself in front of the TV. I don‚Äôt remember ever moving it or touching it after my initial finding.

‚ÄúUhh. It was on the table, it had the poem about the baron? And the pictur-‚Äù

I was cut off by the sound of loud stomping as he re-entered the living room swiftly and sternly. His eyes immediately locked on the table for moments before matching mine.¬†

‚ÄúSo you read it?‚Äù

His eyes began to swell and gloss over with incoming tears. His bottom lip seemed to quiver as well but I figured at the time I had been imagining things.

‚ÄúY-yea, it looked cool. And short.‚Äù

My hands began to fiddle with each other, fingers weaving in between each other as I sensed I had done something wrong. My words broke the dam holding back his surfacing emotions and silent tears began to swell down his face as he rushed towards me and crouched down to wrap his arms around my torso in a tight grip. He began sobbing into my shoulder as I returned the firm hug.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Allan. So, so, sorry.‚Äù¬†

Those were the only words I could make out between his sad moans and sobbing. My confusion left me dumbfounded as I hugged my father back and I said the only words that echoed in my mind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Am I in trouble?‚Äù

He loosened his grip and pulled himself back, still kneeling. Wiping his tears from his eyes and cheeks as he sniffled.¬†

‚ÄúWe can talk about it later, okay? You can go back to your show while I make dinner. You haven‚Äôt eaten yet have you?‚Äù

I shook my head and he stood up, still wiping tears.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll fix somethin‚Äô to eat then we‚Äôve gotta get you to bed. Sorry about this bud.‚Äù

My body was frozen, I watched my dad try to find his composure as he hobbled back into the kitchen. I had seen my dad cry many times before, he often sat at the foot of his bed crying with his door cracked in the middle of the night as I got up to go to the bathroom or get some water. I always figured it had something to do with mom, but he never wanted to talk about it, and I had no memories of her, so I didn‚Äôt really share in his grief. Now, he cried the most I had ever seen over the mere mention of some book that I couldn‚Äôt find. Mikey was never gonna believe this.

I awoke the next morning to the sound of my alarm clock blaring, 7 am on the dot. I wandered down my hallway and noticed my dad still passed out in his bed, fully clothed and on top of all his blankets and covers. This was common. I made myself some cereal and got myself dressed for school before I heard a knock on the door as I grabbed my backpack. Opening the door revealed Mikey, clutching his lunch box in one hand and the left strap of his bag in the other.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey, wanna walk together again?‚Äù

‚ÄúYea! I‚Äôve gotta tell you about something I found last night too.‚Äù

I shouted a goodbye to my passed-out father and slammed the door shut after locking the bottom handle lock. During our walk I told Mikey all about the book I found, my dad‚Äôs reaction to it, and finally the poem that resided in its pages. Word for word.¬†

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt scare me with that Barron story anymore.‚Äù

He seemed bored, not the reaction I was hoping for.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm being one hundred percent for real. My dad literally said sorry after I told him about it. I think he might know about the Barron!""

Mikey continued to look like I was giving him a calculus lecture, bored to the bone.¬†

‚ÄúWhatever you say, I‚Äôm not letting you get me with that again.‚Äù

We made it to school, changing the topic to video games, and parted ways at the front to make our way to our respective classes. The rest of that school day was entirely uneventful, just a regular day. Until my walk home with Mikey.¬†

‚ÄúYou SUCK at tag!‚Äù¬†

Mikey mocked me for my poor performance during our shared recess. He wasn‚Äôt wrong, I spent most of my time being it.¬†

‚ÄúWhatever, I could stommmp you in four-square.‚Äù

I did, in fact, take pride in my four-square skills, them being much more real than my supposed karate skills.¬†

‚ÄúOh yea? How about we see who can get through Medal of Honor on the hardest difficulty first and then the-‚Äù

His reply was cut off by a loud bell ringing. It was the type of bell that should be hanging high in a church tower, but its ear-piercing ring resonated in my head as though the bell was sitting right behind me. I recoiled and halted my steady pace as my hands reflexively reached for my head to comfort it. The bell didn‚Äôt cease its ringing until it had let off three loud and deep chimes. It's sound filled my entire head. I couldn't hear my own thoughts.¬†

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶Allan?...Allan?...Are you okay?!‚Äù

Mikey's words finally managed to reach me as the last ring of the bell slowly faded out of my skull.¬†

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt hear that?‚Äù

I was catching my breath that I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding the entire time those sounds echoed through my mind. My face must‚Äôve stank of genuine concern and confusion.¬†

‚Äú...just the weird sounds you were making.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat sounds? You didn't hear that bell!?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo bell, just your weird noises, they were like UGHHH and OHHHH.‚Äù

A smile shot across his face as he began to mimic the groans and grunts I must‚Äôve been making as my head filled with the sounds of the bell.

‚ÄúShut upp, I did not sound like that.‚Äù

I was slightly annoyed that I was the only one affected by the loudest sound I had ever heard. I began to feel like one of those crazy people in all the scary movies that came on late at night.¬†

‚ÄúYou literally did, I thought you were gonna drop dead right there.‚Äù

He continued to mock my previous fit as we walked our way home. When we got to our street, I noticed my dad‚Äôs car in the driveway. I guess he got home early today. I‚Äôd finally be able to get some help on my homework, I thought. I parted ways with Mikey as he continued to mock my noises and poses I took during the ringing that now permeated my thoughts. I gave him a fake finger, the thing where you flip your ring finger up at someone for a split second so it looks like a middle finger, and I ran up to my steps and tried to run inside as quickly as possible. The door was locked to my surprise, so I used the usual key under the rock and made my way inside after placing the spare back under the door.¬†

‚ÄúDaaaaaad, I‚Äôm homee.‚Äù

I shouted the greeting as I tossed my backpack onto the couch. There was no response, so I figured he was in the bathroom. The bathroom was straight at the end of the hallway, with a perfect view of its door when you reach the entryway of the hallway. It was empty, the light off and the door open.¬†

‚ÄúDad? I saw your car outside, so you can‚Äôt try and scare me. I know you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶‚Äù

I said as I was already scared and growing more so, he was usually pretty quick to greet me and ask me about my day. But the silence that currently filled our house was deafening, his car insinuated his presence, but it was nowhere to be found. Unless this was some game. Maybe he was hiding with a surprise gift? Maybe he was gonna pop out of a closet and surprise me with a trip to eat out at a restaurant tonight? Something we hadn‚Äôt done in years.¬†

I reached his bedroom door, which was completely closed for once, and opened it. I found nothing inside, an empty room with a perfectly made bed. I wandered to my room, then double checked the bathroom, then checked the kitchen and living room once again all in search of him to no avail. I ended up in the kitchen once again, flabbergasted. I sat at the table and first noticed a chair missing from our table, there were usually four. Then something in our backyard, like an additional branch to the tree that had sat there for as long as I could remember. I made my way towards the back door and opened it only to be greeted by yet another scene I would never forget for as long as I lived. My father, dangling by his neck only a few feet from the ground from a rope that was tied around the thickest branch on the tree.¬†

I immediately dialed 9-1-1 on our landline and told the operator what I found while unsuccessfully fighting back tears. It took the police and ambulance long enough to arrive for me to wander back to the scene, still spewing tears and snot, and to find a note he had stuck under a rock near his feet and the chair he had undoubtedly used to prop himself up. Him and putting things under rocks. I still have the note to this day and it reads as follows;

>*I am so sorry Allan, I still don‚Äôt know if I made the right choice. A choice you will have to make one day. Unless you don‚Äôt have kids, DON‚ÄôT HAVE ANY CHILDREN. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. Or else you will have to choose. There are no right answers. No right choices. Either way the guilt will kill you. You will end up like me. I love you.*¬†

I am glad I didn‚Äôt throw his mad scribbles away at the time, I wanted to so badly. When the emergency responders arrived I was whisked away to my front yard all the way to the sidewalk as they proceeded to clean up my dad‚Äôs mess and try to comfort me. It wasn‚Äôt long before the sirens shone outside my house before Mikey ran out towards me with his mom following behind.¬†

‚ÄúAllan! What happened?‚Äù

My tear-stained face and quivering lip seemed to be all he needed. He sat down beside me and offered a hug as I began to sob loudly. His mom followed suit in pajamas and a bathrobe and sat down on my other side with one arm reaching around us both in a comforting embrace.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone, I don't have anyone else.‚Äù¬†

I said through broken gasps and steady tears. I was scared for my future, scared of what would happen to me now that my only remaining parent had decided to leave me all on my own.

‚ÄúAlla-‚Äù

Mikey was interrupted by his mom as she wrapped her other arm around us both, embracing us completely now. Her next words offered me more comfort than I would ever feel for the rest of my life so far.¬†

‚ÄúShhhh, it's gonna be okay honey. Don‚Äôt worry yourself one bit. It‚Äôs all gonna be okay.‚Äù¬†",0,1759784127.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False
1nzv4sb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzv4sb,AITA for causing my family to ghost my aunt after my wedding?,"Hi everyone! I love watching the Charlotte Dobre channel  and wanted to share my own story here and get some takes on things that happened that are still not sitting well with me.

I (28F) got married earlier this year in March and for background context, hubby (28M) and I wanted to keep things cheap but nice. So we planned it all ourselves. The big kicker for me was I was working 50+ hour weeks doing construction work while planning and losing sleep so pretty damn stressful. One of the things we spent the least fuss on was the guest list (spoiler for later). Both of us are introverted so we didn't really want a huge crowd anyway. We invited immediate family and some close friends. About 30 people attended overall, including children.

The day of the wedding went fairly well. It was a Saturday morning ceremony, space or galaxy themed. We had shown up the previous night hanging stars and streamers in the reception hall. Coffee and donuts were provided before the ceremony whilst people filtered in and I took a few hours to get ready. The ceremony was short and to the point. The reception was more of a pot luck get together. Everyone had a great time. 

As for the day of regrets I only have 2: With no day of coordinator hubby and I did not get to have a private moment to say a prayer together before the ceremony. And my dad and I missed my entrance cue (as a perfectionist this EATS at me the most). But we were called in by an usher and the show went on.

Now, on to the main drama that grinds my gears: Remember the small guest list?
Well after the event we got a few sad, I wanted to be there so and sos. Those were no big deal as they generally accepted the 'we wanted a small wedding' with grace.
Everyone did this. Except my one aunt, call her L. Now, this aunt I have not seen in literal YEARS. I honestly don't even remember what she looks like.  Three months, yes THREE months, after the wedding she sends me a few texts: *see attached, I deleted the texts off my phone but hubby still had the screenshots I sent him lol*

I blocked her after sending the last text cause frankly I was still dealing with a lot of stress and guilt tripping shit like that does not help my chronic overthinking. Hubby agreed with me blocking her as quickly as I did and suggested it sounded like she only wanted to be present at a wedding for the hype of it all, not to actually support us. I also sent the texts to my mom, who showed my dad (L's brother). I was then told that L had asked my dad if she could come to the wedding about a month before it happened. Which my dad told her that she should ask me directly since he knows we wanted the guest count to be kept small. I never got any call or text until what she sent me.

The flip side is that L's sister (D) is in the same boat; I also haven't seen D for years and she also wasn't invited. And she took the reasoning with significantly more grace and maturity than L.

The other flip? If EITHER D or L had reached out to me directly and asked to be at the wedding I would've invited them both. But not wildly sending out invites to every relative is a flaw on planning your own wedding and working 50 hour weeks I guess. Cause let's be honest, most invitees probably wouldn't attend but might still send well wishes.

Now my dad is angry at L for trying to guilt trip me like she did and is a little frustrated at me for letting her get to me. They used to talk to each other about once a week. Now he is refusing to call her saying, if she wants to stew in whatever is going on with her, she can. He's waiting for her to reach out to him next. He fully believes the reason she texted me so long after the wedding is that something else was going on and she was just looking for someone to fight with.

Now I thrive on pettiness. So my plan is, (primarily since D acted like an adult in comparison to L), when hubby and I have our next life event I plan on inviting D, not L. 
Will that cause more drama? Yes. Do I care? No. You made your bed, now lie in it.",47,1759784124.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,13,0.94,False

I am a 37F and my friend also 37F. We met over 20 years ago in high school.

Some background details that are semi important. I am in a wheelchair and have been since I was about 12. I have a long list of health issues. I have extremely bad anxiety. Even though I did graduate high school I am not really able to work. I don't get out of bed or my house much only once or twice a week for doctor appointments mostly. I get disability and also get food stamps (only $199 for EBT). I usually buy the basics of chicken, fruits, vegetables, water, and juice. I live with my parents and I am super blessed to have an amazing mom who provides a roof over my head, clothes on my back, and I get to eat meals she prepares or buys.  I may not always have foods or snacks I like and/or want but I have the basics and necessities. My parents are considered middle class.I would be considered more on the poor side. As for my friend, she doesn't really have any health issues. She is married and her husband along with her combined are pretty well off. She grew up with her parents, making a six digit figure. She never really had to struggle when it came the money, she did have a few issues.In other areas of her life, but that's not important. 

Now, with all of that out of the way, my friend is usually one of the sweetest people that I know.  We may not talk all the time, but we do talk at least once a week or at least we did before this incident. During one of our phone calls one morning, we were having a conversation about some of the things that used to be our favorite items we drank or ate when we were younger that aren't necessarily now, which turned into a conversation of a list of things that are currently our favorite items. For example, our favorite candy, our favorite hot drink cold drink, soda juice, vegetable fruits. She proceeds to ask me due to my health issues.If there's any limitations on things that I can't or won't eat. I tell her i'm allergic to mushrooms, but she already knows that (I use to have breathing problems after eating them now I just get itchy), I do not eat most condiments, salad dressings, or sauces. I am lactose intolerant. (I only eat ketchup, BBQ sauce, Italian dressing).

Out of nowhere, she comes up with this crazy idea that she wants to order some groceries and items between a few different stores for me. Dome of her favorite things, some of my favorite things, and in general just wants to do some shopping because i've been going through a lot of health issues and depression, and she thinks this will be a boost of happiness.  

Now this is where I might be the A***hole. I politely refused telling her that I did not need anything at this current moment. I told her that I had everything I needed that I would much rather her save her money or potentially give it to somebody who really needed the help right now. I told her it was extremely sweet of her but I didn't need her to waste the money plus there was currently no room in the refrigerator or freezer. (I live with my parents and grandmother) (four people share space plus a few random.items for my 4 year old nephew food and drinks when he is here every week). I promise youI was being extremely nice and begging her not to buy anything because I did not need it and quite frankly, not sure if there was even any space. I did not want any of it to spoil.  I must have said no somewhere between 10-20 times.

Eventually, I got a little tired of saying no and asked if I could know what she was going to but or if it was a surprise? She proceeded to tell me about 30 different items. My anxiety kicked in, because that was a lot food and drinks that I didn't know if we had space for and because I said no so many times. However, I did notice that she wanted to get me some tea. Or coffee that is made with mushrooms. To which, I did not understand because I told her i'm allergic to them. I love coffee, especially ice coffee or frappuccinos. There was some brand mentioned that I had never heard of. Also, she loves mustard. I do not, and she wanted me to try some chip or pretzel that was honey mustard flavored. I politely repeated that I do not want this order. I appreciate her so much for the kindness and the thoughtfulness, but again I am allergic to mushrooms, and I do not like mustard and did not understand why she wanted me to eat something.I did not like.

For the next five minutes, she begged and pleaded with me to just let her buy me some things because it's what she wanted to do it would make her happy and it was her money at the end of the day, she has my address.So she could essentially do what she wants. I finally said, okay, do what you want, butI have one request. Instead of the coffee brand I have never heard of, the mushroom tea that I am allergic to, and mustard flavored things; could you kindly get me Liquid IV electrolyte powder to mix in my waters. I am forever dehydrated, and this would be a boost to my electrolytes for hydration and the added vitamins and the minerals that they have. It would also be significantly cheaper than the coffee mushroom tea and mustard flavored things that I would not end up eating or drinking. As I did not want her to waste any money because money is valuable comes from hard work and I'd rather have things that I will actually use and need.

She absolutely lost her mind and begin yelling and screaming, telling me that i'm selfish and beggars can't be choosers (never asked for her to buy anything to begin with). She went from being as sweet as honey to a nuclear bomb in less than 10 seconds. She proceeded to tell me how terrible I was and how others would be so much more grateful. I mentioned that I never asked for any of this to begin with she called me a few names and hung up on me. I have not talked to her since.

Can someone explain to me what i'm missing? What did I do that was so wrong? My mind is not understanding. All I did was ask her to swap out something I knew I would never use for something that I need.

enter the mother-in-law from hell. she came in pretending to ‚Äúmediate,‚Äù but it was clear she was on his side while claiming she wasn‚Äôt taking sides. we sat there for SEVEN HOURS while she twisted everything i said until i was emotionally drained. my poor friend just sat there like an unpaid extra in a family soap opera.

by the way, this wasn‚Äôt the first time things got violent. less than a year ago, he choked me, again in public. and somehow, he still paints himself as the one who‚Äôs been ‚Äúhurt‚Äù in the relationship. we broke up and got back together bc he told me that he'll change.

after that disaster, i went home, packed my things, and left. i thought that was the end of it. turns out, it was only the start.

his sister (30f), the only girl in their family, took it personally. she kicked me out of every group chat and started spreading stories that i was the problem. apparently, this is her usual thing. she likes intimidating and manipulating any girl her brothers or cousins date, acting like the self-appointed guardian of their fragile egos.

meanwhile, my ex started showing his family ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù ; screenshots of my angry texts after he embarrassed me in public. no context, of course, just the parts that made him look like a saint. and the family? they believed every word.

so to my ex‚Äôs mom and sister, if you ever find this post, congratulations. you‚Äôve officially turned your family drama into a group activity. you can keep him, the excuses, and all the theatrics. i‚Äôm free, and i‚Äôm not looking back.",5,1759783915.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False

So after that we decided to sleep and I realised there was no room where I can sleep everyone took mattress and blankets and there was none left for me so she said you can sleep on my bed.

I immediately closed my eyes and laid back. When she came to bed I was hard as fuck. I didn't felt my boner because I was feeling buzzed too so I shifted my position to her side and I accidentally rubbed it on her. I definitely knew she felt it cause I felt a little movement on her legs. So we slept and woke up really late in the morning she woke up early cause she was seeing off others.

The only ""issues"" that we've had with her since then are her begging habits that I've posted about in here before, but we've come to accept those hahaha. Aside from the begging, behaviorally, she's a pretty chill, mild-tempered cat. That is, until about a little over a year ago, when she occasionally started acting pretty aggressive specifically towards me. 

The first time she started acting out, as embarrassing as it is to admit, I was crying in bed. In her defense, it was probably fairly loud and startling, but she jumped onto the bed, and immediately started hissing and pouncing on me. NGL, it was scary, as she's a decent sized cat. The only other time I had seen her hiss was when we had first gotten her and we were introducing her to our other cat (who she has coexisted with wonderfully and didn't take much time at all to warm up to). The obvious assumption was that crying is a trigger of her's, however, she has not once had this same reaction with my girlfriend (we're emotional people haha) who is arguably a louder crier than I am. Since the first time it happened, I've tried to keep any crying to as quiet of a volume as possible, but this situation has happened a handful of times since then. 

There was another time a couple of months ago where I was putting on my shoes before leaving for work, and I hit the side of my foot pretty hard on the coffee table. It hurt like a bitch, but my girlfriend was sleeping in the next room over, so I let out the quietest ""OWWW"" as possible as I winced and held my foot. Once again, she runs over to me, and starts hissing and swinging at me. 

Most recently, there has been a stray cat that seems to live in the alley behind our apartment building, which our windows look directly into (what a view). Ever since the first time she saw him, she has made the cat tree by the window her usual resting spot, always keeping an eye out for him. When he's around, she's on high alert (tail swinging, some chirping) and will run about the apartment trying to get a view from every window. When I try to stand behind her at the tree to see him for myself, she, you guessed it, hisses and swats at me. Sometimes I don't even have to stand behind her; I can literally just walk into the room while he's outside and she will start to hiss. I did think seeing another cat that's not her sister would make sense for her to become aggressive, but again, she does not do this at all to my girlfriend.

I don't know what to do, or what I did to make her act this way only towards me. The only thing that comes to mind is that I have sprayed her with a spray bottle a handful of times since we've had her when she's started biting plastic at my desk. Even then, though, my girlfriend has done this to her far more times, and most of the times that I've done it, I just pick up the bottle for her to see without even spraying. Maybe she prefers my girlfriend since she's normally the one who feeds the cats, but I still am the one to feed them at least a few times per week. Not to make this a me vs. my girlfriend issue, but I am even more respectful of the cat's boundaries than she is, as my girlfriend will often pick her up and hug her even though the cat clearly doesn't like it, and I try to only to only pick her up if she needs to be moved. 

This is not a constant issue, she is very sweet/neutral to me 85% of the time;  I just don't understand why when she does act aggressive, it's only towards me. I don't think it's reached a point where a vet needs to get involved (I will mention it at her next check-up, though), but I'd really appreciate any tips/guidance if anyone's gone through something similar.

I made my most recent order into powder mostly using my food processor which worked for the majority of it but a lot of it just would not powder, it was kind of stringy for lack of a better word, the coffee grinder and blender also didn't work.  It's obviously something I'm willing to deal with considering the fact that the cheapest place I can find them as powders are like eight times the price but I'm just wondering if anybody has a suggestion for machine to use to turn a grindable product into a powder, I realize some things like cryptolepis are simply not grindable with home machinery but I am very interested in suggestions for the stuff that is. 

I am not looking for sites to order it from unless it's in the UK and is relatively the same price that I'm paying now, I'm not willing to pay two or three or four or more times for powder.

1nzuqtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nzuqtj/is_the_best_water_boiler_zojirushi_micom_worth/,Is the Best Water Boiler Zojirushi Micom Worth the Hype Yet,"Zojirushi CD-WCC30, from my experience, has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I wasn‚Äôt expecting a water boiler and warmer to have such an impact, but after daily use, I can confidently say it offers convenience in ways I hadn‚Äôt fully anticipated. With its 101-ounce capacity and sleek silver dark brown design, it fits perfectly on my countertop without taking up too much space. Its micro computerized temperature control system, paired with the thoughtful one-touch electric dispensing system, made my morning routine surprisingly smoother. I found it particularly useful when juggling multiple tasks ‚Äî having hot water ready for tea, instant noodles, or even quickly sanitizing utensils is a game-changer.

**Intuitive Design and Ease of Use**

The nearly polished finish and compact dimensions (11.25""L x 8.25""W x 11.5""H) make the water boiler blend effortlessly into my kitchen‚Äôs decor. Handling it feels intuitive; even my coffee-loving coworker, who isn't tech-savvy, figured out its operation in minutes. The wide-window water level gauge stood out as a nice touch. Measuring and monitoring water levels can be the most annoying part of using similar appliances, but here it‚Äôs delightfully straightforward. It's also relatively lightweight at five pounds, making it easy to shift between counters when needed.

**Good Aspects**

- Micro computerized temperature control ensures consistent performance.
- Four temperature settings (160¬∞F, 175¬∞F, 195¬∞F, 208¬∞F) provide flexibility for diverse uses.
- Quick Temp Mode skips the boiling stage, which is great for reducing steam output and energy use.
- The BPA-free nonstick interior saves a ton of cleaning hassle.
  
For anyone hesitant about boiling water repeatedly or wanting a reliable appliance for instant hot water, this feature set feels incredibly thoughtful and adaptive.

[Check Zojirushi CD-WCC30 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b01m04lr6p/)

**Energy-Efficient Features**

What stood out to me here was the energy-saving timer ranging from 6‚Äì10 hours. I tested the timer function during my evening tea-to-relax ritual. The water was piping hot whenever I needed it, and I noticed no unnecessary energy waste. Over a couple of months of usage, the energy efficiency became particularly evident with my utility bills. Plus, the sound indicator, an ever-so-gentle beep, alerts you to low water levels without scaring everyone in the household awake.

**Drawbacks**

- The lid isn‚Äôt detachable. Cleaning around it can be tricky.
- The cord is a little short for my liking, depending on where your outlets are located.
- While the Quick Temp Mode is efficient, it‚Äôs not ideal if you value the traditional boiling process with dechlorination.

**Performance in Daily Use**

Boiling water on my stove feels prehistoric after experiencing the Zojirushi CD-WCC30‚Äôs performance for weeks. The Quick Temp functionality became invaluable during busy mornings. It directly heats water to the selected temperature without requiring boiling, which I found most beneficial when using filtered or spring water. And if you‚Äôre like me, standing around waiting for water to cool goes out the window thanks to the precision temperature controls.

**Direct Competitors**

Looking at alternatives, I had previously considered models like Panasonic‚Äôs thermal pots and Tiger‚Äôs comparable units. While the Panasonic model has some sleek features, it doesn‚Äôt quite match Zojirushi‚Äôs combination of nonstick interiors and tailored temperature settings. The Tiger model, on the other hand, came with similar features and even a stylish look but was slightly bulkier than this one, making it less ideal for smaller kitchens. Zojirushi stood out as more user-friendly with its clear water level gauge and a refined energy-saving mode.

**Bang for the Buck**

While some might hesitate considering the price range of this water boiler, I genuinely think its features and quality justify the investment. Between the energy savings, versatile temperature settings, and robust build, the price-to-quality ratio felt undoubtedly fair. For someone who values having hot water at the ready for tea, coffee, instant meals, or even baby bottles, this feels like an excellent addition to any household prioritizing convenience and efficiency.

1nzuq70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1nzuq70/trauma_mornings/,Trauma Mornings,"4:00 AM. No sane person should be awake, but the alarm blares anyway. The resident peels himself out of bed and sits to piss. Two reasons for sitting: it‚Äôs too early to stand and aim with accuracy, and sitting buys a moment to pull up Epic. Overnight cases scroll across the screen. Two ex-laps. *Aren‚Äôt they lucky,* he thinks to himself. *No op note yet, guess it will be discovery rounds.*

After that moment of mindfulness, routine takes over ‚Äî mouthwash, deodorant, least-wrinkled scrubs from the pile, and blood-stained clogs. A lukewarm energy drink waits in the garage. Upper-level knowledge ‚Äî warm cans are easier to chug. By 4:08, he is pulling out of the driveway. The town is asleep making this one of the more peaceful moments of the day. Parking is easy. By 4:30 he is in the work room, pulling up the marginally updated list. ¬†

Rounds start at 5:30, 90 minutes to see 35 patients. 2 minutes and 34 seconds per patient. Enough time to check vitals, skim labs, flush drains, change dressings, and press on their belly. Maybe even answer a question and toss out a non-committal plan.

‚ÄúYou might be going home today.‚Äù Exactly what every patient wants to hear.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean might, aren‚Äôt you a doctor?‚Äù is the general response.

¬†Yes, the resident is a doctor ‚Äî sometimes even a good one. But not *the* doctor. Despite the greying hair, 6 years of training since medical school, and wrinkles outlining his eyes, he is still not the attending. Just a resident. But hierarchy is hard to explain at 5:57 AM, especially when it eats into the 154 second allotted for the visit.

‚ÄúJust got to talk to the bosses. If it were up to me, I‚Äôd send you home today.‚Äù

¬†Naturally, all patients leave feeling well cared for and supremely confident in the team. Despite the exchange, the resident outpaces himself, closer to two minutes per patient, which leaves 15 luxurious minutes to get coffee before sign-out. It certainly helps when most of the patients are intubated.

Coffee in hand, the resident approaches the table. Across from him: hollowed out eyes and blank stares, the night team. Poor creatures. A two-person crew, junior and chief, running every consult, covering every trauma, and squeezing in 3-4 emergency cases along the way. They do this for eight weeks straight.

¬†It is said to be a great learning opportunity, but the resident wonders how much learning the PGY-2 is really doing as she nods off mid-sentence.

¬†Perhaps it is learning through deprivation. Deprivation of sleep, of relationships, of routine. Survive without all the things that make you human, and you can survive anything.

But it‚Äôs still too early for the resident to be considering the merits of the system that he willingly signed onto. Besides, he was once trauma junior. He must have learned *something* ‚Äî he‚Äôs the trauma chief now.

Surgery sign-out is a strange ritual. Ideally, it‚Äôs efficient and respectful, handing off patients and confirming plans for the day ‚Äîwho needs an operation, who needs imaging, who needs to go home. It is supposed to start at 7:00. The night team is released once its finished. Out of respect, or just human decency, there should be a sense of urgency.

Of course, sign out ideally takes place with the *whole* team present.

The day attending appears at 7:17. The team is a quarter of the way through the list.

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what patient you‚Äôre talking about. Go to the top of the list, I want to see their scan,‚Äù he says, as if they hadn‚Äôt just looked at the scan and made a plan.

So back they go. Re-discuss, same conclusion.

‚ÄúNot very impressive, looks like an ileus, we need to wait for the bowel to wake up.‚Äù And this continues. For every patient already discussed.

By 8:07, the OR is calling the attending to time out for the first case. The junior‚Äôs pager blares and buzzes, announcing new consults.

Consults are an interesting aspect of residency. A true trick or treat. There could a 22-year-old, BMI 20, virgin abdomen, clear-cut appendicitis in the ER.

Or a cardiac cripple on vaso, epi, and dopamine who CCM is pretty sure now has dead gut ‚Äî its dead because the heart is broken. But sure, surgery can whack it out.

Or, worst of all, a non-operative consult. A patient admitted to medicine with a medicine problem, but in need of surgery‚Äôs blessing. As if surgery is the pope ‚Äî laying hands on bellies and sprinkling holy water, deciding who goes where: heaven (surgical service) or hell (medicine team). Because maybe the heart failure exacerbation could have been caused by the mildly dilated gallbladder without wall thickening or stones.

‚ÄúSign out needs to be quicker. First case is already in the OR. If you showed up prepared, we‚Äôd make it through the patients quicker.‚Äù

Of course, sign out started 17 minutes late, but that could never be suggested as the reason for the extended length. After all, the team spent a *whole* 85 seconds discussing each patient.

Everybody gets up and trudges towards the stairs ‚Äî day team to the OR, night team going home.

‚ÄúSeems like your night was fun,‚Äù the day resident says.

She yawns with exhaustion, ‚ÄúYeah, appy to start the night, then bowel obstruction and a spleen. Not a bad night, you have a solid day though.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI guess, mostly take backs and closures. Luckily no sacral wounds. Maybe we will find something good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never know what you‚Äôll get, see you tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, see you in a couple hours,‚Äù the day resident chuckles.",156,1759783225.0,Residency,28,0.96,False

I am a lurker, but I take so much advice that I thought I would share my first marathon experience as a beginner

I started running in June 2024 to lose weight. I wanted to run a marathon and signed up for Wineglass since it‚Äôs known as a fast ‚Äúdownhill‚Äù course. I trained using Hal Higdon‚Äôs novice 1. I‚Äôm a slow runner, but 11:30 race pace. I hit my 18 and 20 mile goals and was coming up to the marathon super confident until the weather was showing 82 Fahrenheit as the high. I let go of any race goals and just wanted to finish. Originally I was hoping for 5:15. 

Pre-race:

I stayed in Bath, NY mainly because of it being near the start and because none of the listed hotels (on wineglass website) had any availability. Corning museum of glass was the bib pick up and I got there around 4 PM on Saturday. The line was very long so I would suggest going early. The room the bib pickup was in was fairly small. I wanted to pick up some electrolytes and look around, but there were so many people and not too many vendors so I got out quick. I would have loved to look at the museum, but had no time. 

Race Day:

I woke up early to drink coffee and eat. I decided to take 5 huma gels and a handheld bottle and my plan was to fill up at water stations and take huma gels off the course as needed. 

I was also staying in Bath because it was close to the start. When I signed up in December 2024 I had no idea about the buses, but it was still very close to a bus drop off. The bus was really quick, but I got there early at 6:30. Must have your bib to get on the bus. When I got to the start there were tons of port a potties. There was also a large warming tent and the garage open to people, but it was around 50 F and I had a hoodie. There‚Äôs also a bag drop off, but I came to the marathon with my partner so he was picking me up at the end. Everyone just lines up at the start and goes. I think I crossed around 8:16 AM. 

The race started great. Going past the welcome to Bath sign and the sun was out. Around .5 miles my right foot started going numb. This happened 1 time before when I had my shoes on too tight so I stopped and loosened them up. It still didn‚Äôt help so from .5 to about 5 miles I was stopping to stretch my calves, move my foot around and loosen it up more. I had no idea what was happening. I contemplated stopping because how was I going to do this when my foot was numb. It started to alleviate around the 5 mile mark so I kept going. I was trying to stick with 11:45-12 pace for the first 10 miles and did well despite my stopping. Then around 10 the numbness came back. It was so defeating since I was not sure how to stop it. Kept stopping to stretch and walk and hit the half point at 2:40. The numbness kept happening throughout the rest of the time, but wasn‚Äôt as bad as the beginning. 

At 14 miles the sun, lack of shade and numbness hit me hard. I was stopping to walk constantly. It felt like I had never done a training run over 13 miles. I was honestly shocked at how much the sun affected me. I knew it would slow me down, but I was hitting 14-15 minute miles. There is no shade at all. 

They said they were going to have cooling station at 18 and 20, but maybe I missed that. The only extra cooling I saw was popsicles at mile 22 I believe. Then at the finish they had cold sponges. 

The water stops, Gatorade and gel were at all the marked miles. You could take as much as you wanted of the gels/water. They even filled up your bottle which was nice. 

The course ran beside interstate 86. And when you get into Painted Post you go through a park and neighborhoods. Cross a bridge then left to the finish line. 

Shoutout to the guy beside me cheering me on to run to the finish line. He was so helpful in getting me over the line the last bit. 

My moving time on strava was 5:55 - finish time on strava was 6:10. I haven‚Äôt even looked at official chip time because I‚Äôm so disappointed. I felt a little bad when I finished I burst into tears and the volunteer who gave me my medal told me I was going to make him cry. They had so much food available from Wegmans I believe. Cookies, cheese, muffins, pizza and soup. There was a cooling area with ice. I sat and cried into some pizza. They did have some vendors selling merchandise. 

Spectator Info:

I did not find any information on spectator viewing when searching Reddit. There are certain mile markers that they tell you are spectator spots. Mile 13, 20 and the finish my boyfriend stopped at. I believe there‚Äôs another spot at 2. Since I‚Äôm really slow my boyfriend was able to find parking at all the viewing areas he went to. He did say that people were parked at the entrance ramp at the half point, but there was ample parking closer to the course. So I would expect if you‚Äôre spectating for a faster or mid pack runner it may be tough? At the finish he was parked right behind the finish line which was very nice. Also he did hand me water and a new headband at 13 so if you‚Äôre looking for someone to hand you things I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs very easy to do. 

Afterthoughts:

I just think so many things went wrong for me. The heat and my foot. If this wasn‚Äôt a race I would have stopped at mile 2 and tried running the next day. I think if you‚Äôre fast and trying to PR this course is very beautiful, organized and fast. I have a friend that raced and did his PR. I think for me being slower I plan on coming back for the half marathon and trying to find a full marathon in November when it‚Äôs sure to be cold. The area is so beautiful and I‚Äôm so sad I didn‚Äôt go to any wineries, but 2026 for sure :)

Overall, it‚Äôs not horrible. I tried different mushroom protein powders in the past, but ended up walking away from those in ice cream because they‚Äôre simply far too earthy from my tastes.

However, I had been using the Matcha packets in ice cream from the very beginning of my Creami journey and never had an issue. So I decided to try the coffee as well.

I think the Matcha works simply because as a flavor, Matcha is also very earthy. The mushroom doesn‚Äôt stand out. In coffee however, I find that the mushroom flavors do stand out more than I like.

I was able to save this pint by adding a Stroopwafel as a mix in. Though I really wanted that flavor in there so I used a re-spin rather than the mix in setting.

Overall, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd go around recommending this particular combination. But if you‚Äôre looking to get more mushroom into your diet, you could do worse.

1nzu5bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyXperia/comments/1nzu5bg/sony_xperia_5_mk_iv_revisited_in_2025/,Sony Xperia 5 Mk IV (Revisited in 2025),"Bit of a long one, so grab a large coffee!

I reviewed the [Sony Xperia 5 Mk IV in October 2022](https://tedssalmagundi.blogspot.com/2022/10/sony-xperia-5-mkiv.html) and was very positive about the dinky (kinda) flagship from Japan. Since then, a few things of note have happened, which I'll come to - but for now, the question is whether or not it could still be used as a primary phone 3 years later - and what's still great about it, if anything.

We've had all the Mk V (1, 5, 10), Mk VI (1, 10) and Mk VII (1, 10) Xperias since then of course as the years have progressed. Notice anything missing? Yes, you're clearly a genius - the Demise of the Five. They made a Mk V but then that seems to have been the end of it, though traditionally tight-lipped Sony don't actually say so. I suspect that with the 10 Mk VII specs being somewhat upped this year, it doesn't point to Five Alive!

This 5 Mk IV has run out of updates. OS was given a measly two, so Android 14 was the last, and 3 years of Google Security Updates, so until September 2025. I write in October here and the phone has indeed been given quarterly updates for the last 12 months, but I suspect that this is it now. There might be a September update coming this month I guess, but very possibly not - and even if there was, it would certainly be the last.

But most people don't care about that (or even know) and chugging along in the background is the Google-controlled Play System Updates, which keep things pretty safe for way into the future. So no development of, or updates to, Sony apps going forward but everything else should continue until Google pull the plug on Android 14, I guess, which, going by recent comparative behaviour should be at least 10 years. Android 6 (Marshmallow) was released in 2015 and is still supported at time of writing, so on that basis, this Xperia should be good for another 7 years!

The AlbumArt on the Always on Display was stripped away after the Mk IV Xperias (1, 5) which is a great shame - and further, the version on the 1 Mk IV goes to sleep after the first track. So it shows the AlbumArt of the last playing track when the screen timed out and stays there. That makes the 5 Mk IV even more special as it doesn't do this and continues to update as tracks change. No idea what is different between them to have changed this but in my experience here, this is what happened. Anything newer than the Mk IV devices don't get it at all.

And that is also true of the Notification LED. A tiny dot in the top-right, front-facing, which gives notifications of stuff coming in, charging status and so on. It's hard to stress how useful this is, even with a bright Always on Display available too, as it's the glanceability (if that's a word) factor. It catches the eye as it flashes, changes colour or glows - for an instant view of what's come in or how the battery is or whatever. For anyone having not used a phone with this in the past, you don't know what you missed!

So various LED colours then - red for low battery, green if the phone is charged enough, orange if lower but charging, white for most app notifications (though developers were able to assign their own or even use patterns of blinking - so check your apps as they might still do it), blue is for, you guessed it, Bluetooth stuff and there are apps on the Play Store which allow further granular control. It's a hark back to earlier years when most OEMs did this but now, the best you can hope for is, yes, third party, but certainly no physical lamp (that I'm aware of) so all in-screen. So anyway, yes, gone.

The price is now of benefit to buyers of course, though you'd be hard-pushed to find a new one now (and if it had been sitting on a shelf in a stock room, the battery would be knackered by now anyway!), a far-cry, used, from the ¬£949 release price in the UK! I just had a look on CeX in the UK for a used one in good condition and it seems to be about ¬£300 - less on eBay no doubt - so certainly less than a third of that release price, maybe even a quarter.

This was the first 5-series Xperia that got Qi wireless charging and three years on it's still working perfectly well here. We don't get any battery health data here so without deeper diving with various apps/tools/testing, I can't see what that is - but it certainly appears to be working well and not far away from the review data I quoted three years ago. Yes, the 5,000mAh battery in this dinky device (how did they fit it in?!) is still quite superb - my 10% Reading Test still returns a result of over two and half hours and for my average daily use, a day and a half if needed. Your mileage will vary of course, based on how you use your phones.

The dinky physical form is now unique I think. Certainly in its 21:9 ratio. It's very cute - and the 5 Mk V went fatter, so not as nice. It's really slim and pocketable and even for someone not wanting to use it as their main phone, it can be a perfect on/offline MP3 Player (I'll come to that later though). I did recently wonder about the 21:9 and conclude that Sony were wise to switch out to 19.5:9 for the Mk VI model (1) and Mk VII (1, 10) but I'm not so sure with the slim MP3-player sized 5 Mk IV here. It kind of feels just right for purpose as it is. It would be nice to see it in 19.5:9 but I do think it would have less impact (and the 10-series has always been a bit chunkier anyway).

Yes, the boxy aluminium design works nicely with the symmetrical bezels making room for the sensors and speakers and flat, 6.1"" 1080 x 2520 (449ppi) screen which remains bright and colourful (and free from scratches with GGVictus) with 101 ways in Sony's software to tweak and adjust it. It's a no-compromise (IP65/8) design which Sony have stuck with over the years with Xperia phones and it somehow just feels right again, even with this tiny phone. The only downside to the small form factor is that it's tiny for typing on the keyboard. Gboard can be adjusted to compensate but eventually you have to stop making it taller (as you can't see the rest of the screen) and there's nothing you can do, obviously, about the width. Tinkering with other keyboards or voice input might help, but for me, I accept that I'll need to put on my glasses and be careful (as I like Gboard).

The two-stage camera shutter button is (I think) still unique to Sony. Others have dabbled with capacitive and so-called smart buttons, but I do not believe anyone has come close to this very camera-centric, two-stage button with focus confirmation on-screen in the Photography Pro (camera) app and more. It's fiendish - and makes it a delight for anyone having used proper cameras. As we know, one can make the most of all the photography-centric apps if paired up with a Sony camera, but I've never used one. Check YouTube for reviews of those who are deeper baked into Sony's ecosystem. The other buttons are lovely too though - still working perfectly as they were on Day One, beautifully crafted, for volume and power/capacitive (instant) fingerprint scanning.

And then there's the 3.5mm audio-out/microphone-in socket (which I am guilty of underusing and favouring Bluetooth) giving high quality audio output via wired headphones. It works perfectly well still, 3 years on, with 24-bit output, the drilled-down full version of Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio, upscaling of music via DSEE Ultimate and so on - for those who want to make use of wired headphones (and not be bugged with Notifications and the Google Assistant)! The SIM Card Tray with fingernail access, seems to have survived my abuse over the three years, in/out as a Serial SIM-Swapper regularly, but no sign of it breaking or wearing out.

The 128GB of storage seems mean by 2025 standards but they have stuck with that in all-but the 1-series (256GB) even with the 10-series on brand new release as I write. They clearly figure that their users are going to be happy with the microSD Card expanded memory option - and maybe they are right, with so much mobile phone use now being cloud-based. Speaking as a data-hoarder it kind of sticks in my throat a bit, but in reality, most of the time I have a good connection and use YouTube Music, streaming. So there's that. Anyway, armed with my 1TB card I'm OK - and anyone wanting more for far-reaching photography/videography storage will likely be on the 1-series anyway.

Because of the really clean version of Android on the phone, I remain, 3 years later, amazed at the processing speed of data driven by SnapDragon 8 Gen 1 (4nm) supported with 8GB RAM. Really snappy. I notice the difference when copying stuff from one place to another or getting the Play Store to install app updates etc. Blazingly fast - and without any resource-hungry AI to be driven, the 8GB RAM is perfectly good still. Yes, the phone flies with any tasks thrown at it, even demanding games (not that I do much of that)!

I hear no degradation in the powerful front-facing proper stereo speakers 3 years on. They remain, as I reported before, loud, bass-orientated enough (for the size of the phone), clear and with good tone. The Dynamic Vibration is something else that nobody does in the same way - and Sony sadly removed it with the Mk V devices (10-series never had it). This also works perfectly 3 years on and the fact that it is now missing from newer devices (other than the 5-series) is yet another great shame. The pulsating of the vibration motor to beats in the music is wonderful to feel/use. So, another tick for this older model. Hooked up to my WH-1000XM4 headphones (now, themselves, two generations old) remains perfectly good. Are we seeing a pattern here?!

I continue to make use of HDMI-Out (DisplayPort) here now and then, though again, with connectivity and latency options so good these days, it's something that needs to be on the 'handy-to-have' list rather than Mission: Critical one in 2025. Plex and Roku changed so much of that for me! All the connectivity stuff works perfectly well still to, so apparently the components were good at the outset and have stood the test of time.

One of the changes Sony made with the 1 Mk VI was to ditch much of the confusing Cinema Pro, Music Pro, Photo Pro and Video Pro cludge for a unified, user-friendly, non-geeky approach to all things camera. And that was a good move because all this stuff is complex on this phone and feels like it's geared up for photography nerds, not Joe Public. It depends on your approach to all things photography I guess but they'll reach a much wider audience by making it not so stuck-up-in-the-clouds. So yes, with the 2022 phone here, one is not going to get a change on that. You can always use a different camera app to keep things simple, I guess. However, it's nice to have a 2.5x zoom on the camera and 3 x 12MP shooters which do the trick with the Zeiss Optics with T\* lens coating and all those Program, Shutter Priority and Manual modes. So many dials and buttons to play with for those who want to deep-dive.

I'm not really the 'pro' target audience for this phone as I won't be VLogging, shooting a movie or even recording high quality audio, but with the stuff on offer here generally as a mobile phone (and already in the house here - or cheap to buy now, used) it might be worthy of consideration, abandoned by Sony as it is. Is a later version really needed? I guess a lot of that depends on one's view regarding the later simplified auto-all camera (which, by the way, you don't either get in the 5 Mk V) and software update situation - for those who are not bothered about ongoing Sony support but are trusting Google to keep it secure, it's still worth a look in my view. It still has a good number of now-unique features which Sony have stripped out going forward (and nobody else even did) and it really is lovely in the hand, the pocket, light and dinky (for those with good eyes and nimble fingers for that keyboard)!

It has a load of good aspects going for it including Qi charging, great speakers (and audio all-round), Dynamic Vibration, super battery, a great OLED panel with the best AoD there is - and that LED Notification light. Well worth considering if you fancy a small phone which keeps it simple in many ways, no AI (apart from what Google supply) and still as fast as lightning in pretty much whatever you throw at it. It still works perfectly well in 2025 and is recommended if you can find one used - there's an awful lot of phone here for under ¬£300.

I (22F) got engaged earlier last month to my now fianc√© (23M). I've been dealing with health issues on and off for my entire life and mental health issues since I was 12. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 20. Knowing my body, it's only a matter of time before another health issue pops up. Things have been going extremely well with my fianc√© up until a few days ago.

When we first started talking, I disclosed that I had bipolar. He basically said it changed nothing about how he felt about me or the relationship and that it was a non-issue but he wanted to know what meds I was taking so that he could support me better. Sounded great to me and seemed like a green flag.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago: he asked me more questions about my bipolar disorder and how it affected me. He admitted he was worried about being able to handle my mood swings and other symptoms should my mental health go south again and that he wanted to gain an understanding of what he might have to deal with in the future. I explained that, unmedicated, it affected every aspect of my life, but that since being on meds, I've been completely asymptomatic. Things seemed to be fine after that.

Around that time, I had started experiencing fatigue more severely than usual. I first noticed it earlier this year but I was able to function so I didn't mention it much to my fianc√©. I started bringing it up to him more often about a few weeks ago - not to complain, I was just honest about feeling tired when he asked how I was doing, especially during the day and in the mornings when my fatigue was at its worst. He knew I had gone to the doctor about this and that she had ordered bloodwork. He also knew that I was sleeping 12-14 hours whenever I had the time to do so and that, even on those days, I would also feel the need to nap for at least 2-3 hours at a time.

Things came to a head a few days ago. I was still waiting on my blood test results to see why I was so tired all the time. I had a health scare (heart rate was reading super high on my smartwatch) and I called an ambulance because I could feel my heart pounding, hence why I checked my watch to see my pulse. My pulse turned out to be normal when the paramedics checked it. I decided not to go to the hospital but I also decided to cut back on the caffeine because I was consuming way too much to stave off the fatigue. I was an emotional mess that night because I was both embarrassed and devastated about losing access to the one thing that helped me get through the day. I was worried about making it through the rest of the semester, fatigued and uncaffeinated. I vented to my friend and cried it out, then I called my fianc√© and vented a bit, too. I have never been this negative around him before - I usually try to stay positive so I don't bum him out. He was like, ""What's the worst that can happen?"" and I replied that I might end up not graduating college. He said that God always finds a way to provide. I believe in that, too, but it just wasn't what I needed to hear at the time. He also said ""I know you don't like hearing this, but it's going to be okay"". I broke down and talked about how hopeless I felt and how I doubted that the results would show anything because I had felt fatigue on and off since I was a kid and the results always came back ""normal"". He seemed to listen and understand.

The next day, I felt like I got hit by a bus without my coffee to keep me afloat. I told him about it when he asked how I was doing and he said ""Yeah, it'll feel like this for a couple weeks until you build a habit"". I felt kind of frustrated because it wasn't due to my caffeine use, it was due to my fatigue that my caffeine wasn't masking anymore. I told him this and he said, ""But what if the results come back normal and this is just some confusion you've got going on in your body?"". I told him how that made me feel unheard and he asked me how he could help. I asked that he look into radical acceptance as a way to console me and I tried to describe how the fatigue made me feel on the daily so that maybe he would understand and take me seriously. He said that the relationship is becoming depressing and he feels sad because he can't help me and that it's not normal for him to feel like this in the beginning of a relationship rather than to feel love and happiness.

We called later that evening and he said that he doesn't know if he can handle feeling this way (after 3 weeks of acute symptoms and one moment of weakness on my part where I was brutally honest about how I felt). I asked him if he could handle the idea of me experiencing pregnancy complications or needing care postpartum. He said he didn't know. I asked him why he thought I was feeling fatigued and he said he thought I was ""maybe overthinking"" or that it was due to my busy schedule. He added that I ""seemed fine"" when we called.

I got my lab results back yesterday and I have very low iron. That would explain my fatigue and also possibly my pounding heart. It wasn't all in my head. I told him about it and he immediately apologized for making assumptions about the cause of my fatigue and he said he hasn't been a good supporter of me. I told him that it was hurtful that he needed ""proof"" to believe me when I had been telling him I felt tired for weeks. I said I needed time to think about what to do and he said that he would accept my decision no matter what.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm glad he's able to reflect and apologize but I don't know if I can trust him going forward. My mom asked me whether I could trust him to make lifesaving medical decisions for me and to take care of me if I couldn't take care of myself. I said I didn't know. I must add: as of today, he's been asking how I feel health-wise and he seems to be making an effort to change. I can't tell if I'm overreacting to this situation or if this is a sign of a bigger issue. I still don't feel like I can vent to him without worrying about whether he can handle me being upset. I feel like he's terrified of confrontation or any type of negative emotions. In the past, when I'd bring up articles to read so he could understand me better as an autistic person, he'd say ""okay I will check it out, now be happy please I don't want you to get hurt or upset"", as if me bringing up a way he could support me is me starting a fight or being upset. But also, this is his first relationship and I can tell he's afraid to lose me. He also comes from a non-western culture where expressing negative emotions is seen as ""killing the vibe"". I'm not sure whether I should give things one more try or run.

TL;DR: My partner only took my fatigue seriously after my lab results came back positive. He also fears conflict and has questioned whether he can handle my medical and mental health issues twice. But he seems to be growing as a person and there are also some cultural differences between us. I'm not sure whether to give him another chance.",0,1759781787.0,relationship_advice,33,0.4,False
