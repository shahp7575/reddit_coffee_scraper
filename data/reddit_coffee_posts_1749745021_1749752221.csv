1l9tke3,https://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1l9tke3/i_stopped_listening_to_the_live_show/,I stopped listening to the live show,"After 32 years, I stopped listening to the live shows in March. I'm now relegated to listening to Howard History, where I can pick and choose which segments I want to hear. But even then, I find myself skipping probably 60% of the content. Instead of calling it Howard History, they should rename it “Ronnie and JD History.”

There were too many retread guests who only came back to promote something. And anyone who wasn’t a retread was outside my demographic of being interesting. I doubt Howard finds them interesting either. But the show has always been a promotion machine. It’d be nice to hear an interview with somebody who’s genuinely interesting—not just promoting something.

I couldn’t stand listening to any more of his guitar journey—struggling to get out a few chords and baiting Fred and callers into complimenting him.

I used to like Mariann, and now I can’t stand her. She’s become a caricature of herself, used by Howard as a delivery mechanism to promote his or Beth’s own interests.

I could list a hundred other reasons why I stopped listening, but I’d like to congratulate Chris Wilding and John Blitt—you two were the final nails in the coffin for me.

Chris constantly crowbars his way into the show, sometimes two or three times an episode. He is not the impressionist they give him credit for. A good portion of his impressions sound like spin-offs of Rocky Pendergast. When he doesn’t have content, he doubles down by going over the top with whoever he’s attempting to impersonate. Prime examples: Underdog and Bigfoot. Listening to Howard and Robin overly belly-laugh made it all even worse.

As for Blitt, I don’t think I’ve laughed at anything he’s ever produced. Mitch Mitchell’s? Music news? Baby Radio? He must make one hell of a cup of coffee, because his bits are terrible. And shame on whoever gives them the green light to go on air. Anytime one of his bumpers comes on during Howard History, I skip it immediately.

I'll admit—it was hard at first to stop listening to the live shows. But then I realized I was tuning in for maybe two or three minutes a week of something *slightly* humorous. The rest of the time, I found myself resenting Howard and the rest of the staff. But most of all, I was angry at myself for not quitting sooner.

As I mentioned, I’ll continue to cherry-pick from Howard History, and I still listen to the baseball games at night. For those reasons, I’ll keep my subscription—for the time being.

Live show—Bye for now…

He once left me the day before my birthday but came back after a month, and I forgave him.

In 2023, I broke up with him because he had become really over-possessive and toxic for a few months. I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I left. Surprisingly, I didn’t cry or miss him much afterward. I made new friends and started college. I did stalk him from time to time—he was my first everything, after all.

Now, two years later, he texted me to say sorry. He admitted he didn’t know what got into him, that he became toxic and said things he now regrets. He took accountability and realized it was his fault—but now it’s too late.

I told him I don’t want to get back together, and I meant it. But when we talked, I cried a lot. Remembering everything really hit me.

I think it was grief probably, I am confused. Then I was saying final goodbye to him, I cried, Idk why I wanted him in my life, I didn’t want to say goodbye (goodbyes are hard for me, even with friends)

But in the end he said if I’m comfortable, he would like to meet me for a coffee.

I’m not sure what to do. I have no issues meeting up with him but I’m just not sure what to do at all.

1l9thye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l9thye/i_think_my_dad_abused_me_when_i_was_a_kid/,I think my dad abused me when I was a kid.,"Hi guys, I don't even know how to open up about this. Definitely a sensitive subject for me but I need to try. This is going to be long (Its not my first language, dont get mad if I make mistakes lol, im trying). 
I think my father sexually abused me when I was a kid but idk how to prove it. I just saw a tiktok of this mother who was talking about the signs she saw in her daughter that lead to her finding out that she was abused by her husband. And i just started crying. My heart is so heavy. I constantly have this pressure that I feel in my body and I know its because of what happened. 
I honestly just need someone to be straight up with me and tell me if what I experienced was weird or not and if it can count as SA. I don't need sympathy or anything. I just need to know I'm not crazy. But tell me if I am. I'm not trying to cause him any harm by framing him or something but I genuinely hate him. I'm so disgusted by him and by myself. Probably a big reason of why I started self harming. I have so much anger and this sadness in me. 
Im just going to name some of the stuff I was experiencing as a possible result of SA. 
Unfortunately I had diapers until I was 9 or 10. I was still wetting the bed at that age.. 
This is also extremely embarrassing for me but I used to like humping stuff. I constantly wanted to get off and I did.. in front of people as well. It makes me sick to think about. 
I was also very complaint (thats what made me cry when I heard that woman on tiktok talk about how her daughter was the same). I used to do everything for my family. I never said no. Now im the opposite. This is lowk funny ig but I used to bang my head on walls a lot. Either to self soothe or to just hurt myself (idk if this has any correlation to the SA though). I also constantly had BV when I was young, way before puberty hit.  My dad used to wash me when my mom wasn't home and when he came to wash me down there he used to put the soap in along with his fingers (I used to cry a lot when he washed me or took baths with me. I think actual SA mightve actually happened when he used to take baths with me. I mostly just remember pain, he used to put soap in my eyes and i remember just crying and constantly saying sorry for making him mad). So I think thats why i suffered of BV so much (could possibly explain the humping too ? Cuz maybe i was trying to get rid of that feeling ? I just remember my private parts used to hurt a lot and burn too). This was when I was small small, I didnt hit double digits yet. I also did a lot more things but i cannot remember it all right now. Im gonna focus on my dad's behavior now. He always used to compare me to the women on the screen who had more voluptuous bodies ever since I entered puberty and I didnt look like a kid anymore. He used to slap my ass but he stopped that when I got mad once and told him to stop and then he cussed me out in front of my family and started to talk like he was the victim here and caused a huge scandal. He said I was exaggerating and that he was only joking. My mom was there and she told him to not joke like that no more but then she took his side in the end. This was in like 2021 possibly 2022. For reference I'm 22 now. 
He used to masturbate in front of me and my siblings but idk if any of them noticed. But I definitely did. He used to sit on the bed or couch as us, on his tablet watching porn and just stroke himself through his boxers. I def think my siblings noticed but they were too small to know whats going on and maybe they forgot about all of this. 
I wish I did too, it was very traumatic for me. This was when I was smaller, not even 14. 
He also did it when I was older as well but it was in the mornings when he drank his coffee, knowing that we had to pass by him to go to the toilet. He used to talk to us during that as well. 
My mom was there too but she said she didn't know anything about this but I honestly do not believe that cuz it was obvious. 
Hes also very comfortable just sitting naked around us, he takes his clothes off in front of me and my family before he goes to shower and smokes a couple of cigarettes like that too. I always state that it makes me extremely uncomfortable but nothing changes. He's been doing this since forever. He often asks me if im looking for men and if i want d##k, if i lost my v card and just sexualizing me in front of my family and idk why they never say anything. He did this since I was a child. It hurts me a lot. One because my own father talks to me like that and two cuz nobody ever tells him to stop. 
This year I gained the courage to open up to my mother about everything thats been going on. I feel like i touched the most important parts of what he did. Obviously i did it crying, i was a mess. But i manage to speak. She asked me questions, i answered. She was disgusted. I think by me the most. I have no idea if she believed me or not. She didnt comfort me, i really wish i could've received just a pat on the back at least. But i didn't. She told me that it'll pass and i have to be strong and to forgive and forget. Then she left me crying at the table. But she had such a cold and disgusted look in her eyes. But i understand, i think it was hard to hear. I thought things would change but they did not. Not one bit. I'm just disappointed, idk.. I feel like she doesn't care about what happened or maybe she just pushed it in the back of her mind as soon as i told her. That hurt me a lot too. I think it was one of the hardest days of my life, to actually open up and speak. It was the most painful think ive ever done. I just cry sometimes because of everything thats going on. I think it caused me to dissociate a lot and not be very present at home or in life in general. I hide inside of myself. I think everything just made me a very cold person. I cannot talk about anything going on in my life with my family and im just very unemotional now. Im just labeled as a b#tch now, im just ""fake"", I dont care about them and I couldnt care less if they died. And I dont know, maybe they're right in a way. Maybe I don't care as much anymore. But I don't care about myself either. I dont think they'll ever know how suicidal I am, how depressed I grew up to be. I definitely have an emotional blockage. I try to open up sometimes but I just can't, it never goes out well. I lose myself half way. I dont know how to describe how I feel. I feel like I skipped that stage in my childhood where you just learn how to express yourself in general. I feel like nobody really knows me, especially my family. Is it bad that in a way I despise them all ? 
I'm currently in college, trying to get my life together and just leave everyone. I feel like there's still so much to say, so many things that I didnt touch.. but its enough for now. 
Idk if anyone will read everything but if anybody does.. thank you for taking some time off to just read about my life. I appreciate it. Sometimes I need to vent too. ",2,1749751829.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm a dad. I'm not one of the moms paling around with the other moms, getting coffee together, chatting together, etc. I see them all the time and the dads just don't do this. The dads either aren't at school pickup or drop-off ever (I get it, they work outside the home) or the dads that come and go do just that - they show up and leave and there isn't social interaction. 

I'm extroverted and struggling to combat this. I don't have free time, my wife works a stressful and intense job, we have three kids, so it's not like I have time alone just to myself where I can go find a meetup or a hobby or a part time job or something. That will happen in the fall when all three are in school at the same time, but at that point I should be working doing something to make some sort of income.

I’ve had about 8mo with a trigger-food-free house. I lost 17lb and got really fit. I also felt better mentally and physically.

In the last two months, my partner and I started allowing some light triggers back as needed for various events. I began compulsively making sweets more and more often. Gained back a few lbs and realized I was restarting the cycle.

My partner is frustrated because he can’t keep anything in the house that is sweet or could make a sweet (ie sugar, coffee creamer, flour, etc). 

We came up with a solution that is a bit radical. Turns out, they make app-based cupboard locks. I moved everything that triggers me into those cupboards and sealed the doors.

I'm looking at a house near the Roosevelt area (around the circled area in the pic), and I’d really appreciate some local insight.

The Microsoft Connector stop I’d be using is at 308 NE 65th St (Greenlake), and based on what I’ve seen on the map, I’d need to cross the I-5 underpass on NE 65th or the Ravenna blvd to get there—likely on foot, early mornings and evenings.

How safe is that underpass to walk through regularly, especially during winter when it gets dark early? Any thoughts on how well-lit or busy it is, and whether it's commonly used by commuters or feels too isolated? The Google maps street view is from 2021 and I see plenty of tents around, not sure if it's still the same.

But when I was first diagnosed, I was struggling to figure out how to enjoy coffee still. The levo and coffee together somehow kept me up way into the AM so I started only having coffee on the weekends. But then I was tired during the week when I was trying to work. I love tea too. But I finally found a perfect solution! I use half decaf, half regular beans for the perfect amount of caffeine. I also add a little cinnamon (always done that but helpful for my metabolism with hypothyroidism), creatine powder (supposedly helps with brain fog, which I do notice) and Vita Coco Coconut Milk. I didn't even think about the fact my milk in my daily coffee was loaded with calcium and affected the absorption of my levo. I drink this now every day and I have noticed a huge difference in my symptoms. I'm energized but not too much and my medication is absorbed properly. Just wanted to share in case anyone else was struggling to enjoy coffee. 

P.S. I use a milk frother to mix it all.

1l9tan8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1l9tan8/retroactive_jealousy/,Retroactive Jealousy,"Long post ahead sorry this is mostly rambling. 

Prefacing this by saying: I love my boyfriend. I love love LOVE my boyfriend I think he is the best possible person for me. We're so in sync, he treats me very well, I can't stress this enough. He constantly changes for me, like, I say I don't like something about his behaviour? It's gone. If he doesn't ""instantly"" (by his standards) change he makes up for it by constantly apologising, he even becomes sulky and guilty even with my assurances that everything's fine because he just wants to be ""good enough for me"" whatever that means for him. He always spends on me- little things like water because he knows I need it, chocolate, ice cream, iced coffee, whatever else I want. He buys me gifts, he always wants to talk to me (and even if he can't because he's drained he'll tell me before logging off), unprompted updates, random ""You're so pretty""s, ""I love you""s, ""I miss you""s- compliments, he never goes a day without telling me how obsessed he is with me, the whole mile. He's not perfect by any means but he is perfect for me, I couldn't be happier being with him.

The problem is... I am insane ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ and I don't mean this to be funny or quirky or whatever have you- I am genuinely crazy when I like a person. He has described me as a ""yandere"" (no matter how cringe that is I am so sorry) lovingly and jokingly in passing but dude seriously if I was a little more ill I probably would be. I get jealous over the stupidest reasons, and trust me- I KNOW they're dumb, I really do.

Exhibit A: when we were still just talking (you know the stage that you know you two like each other but not sure enough so you don't confess yet? When you two are flirting but it's ambiguous enough for plausible deniability? That kind of talking) he wanted to play a game with me and a friend. I asked something, he replied ""Let me ask her"" and my heart immediately dropped when I realized it was a girl. I'm talking not in the mood anymore and freaking out on all of my friends just because what?! He has a girl friend! He wants me to meet his girl friend! I was in shambles. I got over it when we started playing though (because he kept trying to flirt with me in front of her) and the girl and I are friends now.

Exhibit B: He was courting me this time. He went to another campus of our university for his entrance exam. He met a girl there, they talked, he chatted me on his way back ""This girl had a really cool fit on, especially her shoes. I immediately thought of you, you would've loved her."" (Not verbatim text). He thought about me!! He pays attention to what I like enough to remind him of me even when it's on another person!! He talked to another person but first and foremost his mind was on me!!! But all I could focus on was the fact that he TALKED and complimented ANOTHER GIRL!!!!!!!!!! (He complimented her to me he only talked about the exam and where he currently studies at with her).

There was another incident with his class president (my friend, gay, has a boyfriend) and another with a random girl too. Suffice to say I am NOT healthy when it comes to the people that I like. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe it's a confidence issue. I'm fairly confident in myself and my standing with him. He never fails to remind me how much he treasures me and how lucky he is that he has me (verbatim text from him ""I still have no idea how I managed to do that""). 

Pero!!! MAY NAKAKA GETS BA HUHUHUHU .⁠·⁠´⁠¯⁠`⁠(⁠>⁠▂⁠<⁠)⁠´⁠¯⁠`⁠·⁠. I don't like being like this at all. My current issue right now is regarding the same girl that I got jealous of in Exhibit A. We had a talk way back about his type and whatnot, long story, but to summarize it I told him ""I can admit I'm not your type despite you being very attracted to me"" (in my head his irl type is his anime type, which is a stark contrast to me- assumption brought upon by the fact that he's the same as my anime type, though not deliberately. I know it's projecting but it's a fair assumption, isn't it? Especially if your partner is a big anime nerd like mine is). So he told me ""My irl type isn't the same as my anime type. For example, before you, I had a crush on *the friend*."" For context: the friend has the same prominent features as me- hair, body type, both short, both crazy. It was just to drive home the fact that I am INDEED his exact type and I don't need to worry.

So now... Ayon (⁠╯⁠︵⁠╰⁠,⁠) he said he liked the girl na pinagselosan ko. The comment was in passing, and to help assure me pa, but dang it talaga, man. Now I just can't get it off of my head. I brought it up to him irl a few days ago, and he immediately assured it wasn't really anything serious, just a fleeting interest, and it was wayy before we started talking, like, months before he started liking me. Again, like he always does, he apologised, ""Sorry that I made you feel like I was looking at other women"", ""You're the only one I'll ever love, okay?"" And I believe him naman. My boy's an introvert, and has a hard time making friends, kaya he's very dependent on me rin, so I don't think he's just gonna leave me for another person (whatever evil eye is looking at me rn don't play with me) kaya I'm not scared of that possibility. I am just very, VERY, irrationally jealous.

I'm a big feminist, a girl's girl to my core, so it's crushing me that I'm getting jealous over a guy like this. I hate that I'm uncomfortable with a friend (she's SOOO so sweet) and am very hyperaware and tense whenever she gets mentioned- it doesn't help that she's always mentioned because my boyfriend talks to her every day (to the point that his gameplay screenshots either have my chat bubble or hers, so he talks to her alongside me). They have the same interests!!! ANONG LABAN KO DON HUHUHUHU Ó⁠╭⁠╮⁠Ò

If I try to remember the last time I felt unconditionally loved, there’s nothing. No safe place to return to. I’ve never stayed long enough in anyone’s life to be remembered that way, never long enough to be missed like a necessary habit. Not until you. The first person I thought might be worthy enough to make me stay. But I don’t get to be the only one who decides who’s worthy, do I? They get to choose too..whether I’m worth keeping. Worth the space in their world.
April 1st, 2022. The first time I saw you, my stomach spiraled — not with butterflies, but something deeper, stranger. Like I wasn’t the one who left this time..Like something inside me was blooming..I thought, maybe I won’t have to leave first. And I didn’t. Fifteen days in. We were already mutual friends, but something shifted. We shared glances. Water bottles. Lazy corridor walks. Helping each other with assignments turned into:
""Are you doing this one?""
""No.""
""Okay. Me neither.""
Like a secret handshake. Not quite best friends..but maybe something like that. Then came my birthday. One of our final exams. Nobody remembered. Except you. You stood off by the playground, looking at me just long enough to say, I know. That look? Probably the beginning of my downfall. I told myself it was just a stupid crush. It would pass in a week. Or two. Or three. But a year passed. And every time you came too close, my stomach still turned. I tried to distract myself, found a flimsy placeholder.It didn’t work.
Then came June 2023. You asked me to play a video game with you over break. I said yes before even thinking.I practiced for days, trying not to embarrass myself. I did anyway. But you didn’t laugh.. you taught me.
We gamed for hours. Texted all day. Pulled harmless pranks together. You planned, I executed. We laughed..endlessly. I learned how you liked your coffee. Which takeaway sandwiches you preferred over fancy pizzas. Whenever the sky turned pink, orange, or grey, I sent you a photo before you could even look up.
A puppy. A cat. Even an insect, I’d send it. Just to keep the conversation going.
And you always replied. Like it mattered. I knew you too much. Or maybe I thought I did. Still do.
The first time you stood up for me, someone tried to take my seat.. and you held my wrist and told me to stay, beside you. Another time, someone mocked me for something I can’t even remember.. but I remember you at my side. You never had to ask me to sit next to you.. just moved your bag. One day, I fumbled with my shirt cuff. I remember you helped me button it. You even helped me cheat in a test, something you’d never done for anyone else. I thought that meant something. Maybe it did.
If Aphrodite and Adonis had a son, I swear it would’ve been you. Maybe that sounds dramatic, but when you’re seventeen and in love, everything feels like mythology. My friends thought you were just another guy. But that wasn’t the point. The point is: I was already too far gone.

November 1st, 2023. Something shifted. A piece of my heart started pulling away — so slowly I couldn’t name what it was. Just a hollowness. I placed both hands over my chest, trying to hold it together. But my hands weren’t strong enough. By the end of November, it was gone. I sent texts. Many. None were opened.
Three months passed. I blamed boards. Exams. Stress. I told myself, you'll come back. Then came my birthday again. After the exam, I unzipped my bag — and found chocolate. And you, behind me, saying, “Happy birthday.” You remembered. Of course you remembered. So I told myself, This can’t be the end. But it was.
The new academic year began. I chose STEM — just to be with you. First day? You didn’t show. Second? Still absent. I messaged you. Spammed you. Nothing. By the end of the week, you came. We sat beside each other. Not a word. No corridor walks. No waiting after class. Nothing.
And I thought… maybe if I send you pictures of skies… or your favorite sandwich… you'd see. You’d be mine, but not really mine, again. But when weeks passed and my messages stayed unopened — that’s when I knew. That’s when I started pulling away too. I changed my stream. Because what else could I do? I had said I knew you better than anyone. And I also knew this: Once you leave — you never come back.
Half a year passed. Different classes. You ignored me in the corridors like I was just another stranger. I mirrored you. Because that’s what I’ve learned best — to reflect what I’m given. But I wasn’t used to being the one left. I was always the leaver.
We were still “friends.” Shared reels in group chats. But something had changed.
The worst part wasn’t losing you as a friend. It was watching someone who used to know me — pretend like he didn’t. It never looked like something one-sided.
No “just a friend” would remember something from years ago that made me hate a guy.
No “just a friend” would get jealous over me calling another guy fine.
No “just a friend” would give me enough chances to win in chess.
So one night, I broke. Texted you at 3 a.m., crying. Hoping you'd feel something.
But the worst thing isn’t being rejected. It’s being treated like nothing ever mattered. Like the two years were just a blink. A nothing.
So I stopped. No more texts. No more glances. I began pretending not to know you whenever our eyes almost met.
I was right. I wasn’t the one leaving this time. I was the one left.
I don’t know you anymore. But I remember how you liked his coffee — more coffee, less milk, little sugar. And whenever I make mine, it’s still that way. And I still think of you.
A friend told me you still bring those sandwiches for lunch. Maybe you still like them. And whenever I order them — I think of you.
The sky still turns orange, pink, even violet. But I don’t take photos.
The puppies still come — soft, playful — and I pet them. But I don’t share them.
And the insects? I pretend I never saw them.
These days, I button my sleeves quietly. No struggle. Back then, I fumbled on purpose. Because I didn’t need help. I just wanted your hands on mine.
I don’t play that video game anymore. Because it doesn’t feel like ours now. It just feels… empty.
I still look at you sometimes. Only when you aren't looking. And I wonder — how can someone forget everything we shared?
Then, I think of the ones I walked away from. Maybe they didn’t deserve to be left. And maybe I didn’t deserve to be stayed for.
It had always been a very thin line between almost and final. I don’t know why you distanced yourself, acted almost too casual — like that was nothing.
All I know is that I never got the chance to cross that line.
And I swear — if you would’ve given me a chance, I’d buy that whole takeaway just for you, so that you could eat those sandwiches anytime you wanted.
Even though I don’t have a single penny in my pocket right now.
And if some multiverse collides with this one — if reality decides to change — if you ever call me at any time of the day, asks me to come back…
I’ll run to you the same second.

Math was a struggle but I brought my grades up and enjoyed the problem solving. I was very crafty as a kid. Loved writing and drawing. (Still do). I took a lot of random classes and absolutely loved my programming classes. I don’t know what type of engineering I’m interested in but I’d love to start a beginner robotics project. I’m interested in using my skills towards either biotech or environmental conservation and sustainability. I never thought I was smart enough, and naively believed I wouldn’t fit in being female.

He did so many things from fixing TVs to developing software programs for hospitals. I can’t help but feel like this may be my calling. I’ve learned it doesn’t matter what work environment or schedule I have: 9-5 Monday -Friday. 3 12’s, a desk job, walking around, or remote WFH . I thrive on a good team and being somewhat interested in my work. At the very least, I believe this path will help me work on hobbies I’d like to pursue.

It seems like the field can be so broad and challenging, but I’m feeling pretty optimistic.

* **The Palm** Good parking, very cozy interior.  Coffee was good, will return to try more drinks.
* **Three Sisters** Very posh, easy parking.  I had the Irishman, which was very unique
* **Coffea** Parking is good if your lucky to get a spot, otherwise it sucks.  The intersection can be annoying to get out off.  The coffee is good as far as I can tell?  Like its really expensive for how tiny the drinks are, and the crema is really nice.  Maybe this is amazing and my palate isn't elevated enough.

1l9t2tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantHelp/comments/1l9t2tr/repairs_feeling_really_overwhelmed/,Repairs feeling really overwhelmed,"Florida Landlord. Our landlord is notorious with repairs. And I need to rant 

He always sends in his friends and not actual professionals. He says the repairs are up to his standard. Right now I’m prepping the house so we can maybe bring in our own repair people. I know that if we asked our landlord would let us because in the long run it benefits him financially. 

We’re stuck in this two year lease. Our landlord snuck pest control with a weirdly worded clause so our lease is already 300.00 more a month so paying for repairs isn’t ideal (we have to keep everything we own in storage and pest control). 

Has anyone resorted to this? I’m worried of someone coming into fix things and it doubles in cost or we find out are home isn’t habitable. Right now are main concerns include the toilet leaking sewer gas. The water doesn’t taste right anymore and some of the sinks don’t turn on. We’re spending about 40.00 on bottled water a week. I thought about getting a water cooler like you have a in an office but we’re not allowed to have coffee makers or any small appliances (they attract bugs). 

I am thinking that I could find a way to pay to just find out what is wrong with the water (we already paid to replace all the faucet heads which did not do anything). Fix the toilet so it’s sealed to the ground. But at this point I’m also considering asking if we can pay to replace the fridge. It is leaking water and our landlord has had it fixed four times. The attached freezer hasn’t worked for a year. But if someone had to haul away the broken fridge I would also want them to haul away the oven/stove. 

We reported it to our landlord when it broke almost six months ago and he pointed out it wasn’t in the lease and he wasn’t responsible. We’re honestly fine with that because it makes the house so hot but I miss cooking. 

I’m really feeling that you only live once. This is a two year lease. We’re stuck here. I want to enjoy where I live. I wouldn’t want to take anything with us when we moved because our neighbors are never going to get pest control so we’re just putting a bandaid on the problem every month. Mind you our landlord recommended we get rid of all our wooden furniture and I haven’t done that. 

Nothing was ever done on the move in checklist our landlord said that was his right. And I can’t change him or who he is he has a gaggle of lawyers and my partner is afraid of doing anything because we have no idea who our landlord has given a key to. He has a team of lawyers and the free legal service we had before we moved in to check the lease did not catch the things that he hid in our lease .

Right now the lack of working things in our house is overwhelming.  I just want to come home and cook and not have to clean up pools of water 💦 inside the fridge. I have looked at some fridges and ovens and thinking how much burden we are taking on that we shouldn’t have to trying to live in this house why not? We know our landlord is waiting for us to fold. And! We already have to replace the dryer because we’re being held responsible for that repair (we didn’t know it needed to be turned on every ten days).

If we pestered the landlord like we did when the washing machine broke I don’t want to deal with what occurred and that is my choice. The washing machine delivery company would not bring it up the stairs so I had to help move it if we wanted it. And I don’t want to do that. If we paid for it we wouldn’t have to deal with that. Also the washing machine he got is according to Google about twenty five years old and can only wash two items at a time. 

I would get cheap models. I’m just worried about bringing in repair people and finding out we can’t afford it. But replacing the larger appliances? 

We know from the pest control company we were using that the bugs are coming in from the wall where the fridge and the oven are. We don’t keep food out. We don’t really cook. We don’t have any small appliances. We’re trying to find a new pest control place now but if we got a new fridge or oven how long until they have bugs?

I am trying to make the best of it. We don’t want to move. This is the best we can afford. If it won’t impact our relationship with our landlord we would bring in an outside party. But it isn’t something we can do right now. I’m scared of someone coming into our home. We have filed anonymous reports.  

In this situation. What would you do? Why? How would you prepare things for repair people? We keep everything we own in storage bins because it has created some peace of mind. We don’t use any of the shelves, the pantry, etc per the pest control company. 

I just want to go home and cook. Have a working stove. Have a dryer. Have a fridge. 

We have contacted legal services and Florida Tenant Law does not require rentals to repair appliances or replace because our lease does not have a special provision. We’re in a single family home/condo making us responsible for pest control. ",1,1749750841.0,TenantHelp,0,1.0,False

(My own story below)","I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/s/xpTbjuOsHA) post a moment ago and it got me thinking about the times ‘the universe’ gives you a sign, almost as if it’s daring you to follow through and see where it takes you. I don’t know what to think about things like this to be honest, and I don’t want to fall foul of the rules by being overly ‘logical’ in my theorising, but I can say I’ve had plenty of strange serendipitous experiences like this one (though none involving AI, yet.)

That post inspired me (thank you very much u/sitonthewall) to share one such experience that happened to me just yesterday:

This is going to sound ridiculous but it’s true. All day yesterday I kept seeing the number 420 *everywhere*. The 420 memes flooded my feeds, my mates were talking about it when I met up with them for a coffee, it was on TV etc, everywhere. It just stuck in my mind like it had followed me all day, I’m sure others have experienced this or something similar.

That evening (last night) I decided to try my luck at some online slots and deposited £50, I started at around 2am (I’m a night owl haha) and no matter what I did I couldn’t lose. I just kept spinning and winning *just enough* to keep me in the game, this carried on until it was 4am before I knew it. I think to myself “I need to sleep this is ridiculous” and so I up my bet to get it over with.

As it starts to approach 4:20am, I have that weird feeling that maybe something will happen at that time and so I clock watch until it gets closer and closer. As it approaches 4:20am I think to myself “see I’m just being silly, nothing happened” and then I WIN, I swear to God, £420. Now granted I think I cashed in the win at 4:21am or something so it was slightly off, and it’s hardly a massive win, but it was very freaky. I withdrew my money and took that as a sign.

I’ve had other experiences like this where an event seems to be predetermined or at least heavily implied by ‘hints’ I’ve seen throughout the day, but I can’t say how much of this is truly mystical, how much is pure luck, or how much the human mind’s tendency to see things it’s already expecting to see factors in to this. For example, you tend to see more red cars when you’re actively looking for red cars. Regardless, I find it very interesting.

They *always* get my order wrong.



Even if I brought it back and asked for a new one, that one would be wrong too.



Instead, I wait for my date to show up, and slowly flip my unlucky penny between my fingers.



I don’t know how my Father came to be the owner of The Penny. He told me he found it on the sidewalk, but he could have been lying. All I know is that The Penny ruined his life immediately. He lost his job, his house, his wife, and that’s just to name a few, all in about three months.



You see, once you’re “the owner” of The Unlucky Penny, whatever *can* go wrong *will* go wrong, and usually in the worst way possible.



Eventually he couldn’t take it anymore and he threw himself in front of a bus.



He didn’t die, of course. That’d have been lucky. Plus, The Penny likes it when you suffer, and if you’re dead you can’t suffer anymore. 



Instead he wound up in a full-body cast, paralyzed from the neck down.



He begged me to kill him in the hospital. 



I won’t go into details, but I took pity on how utterly *broken* he was.



The second his heart stopped, I felt *it*, like a hot coal had been dropped into my pocket.



The Unlucky Penny.



I was its owner now.



I tried to get rid of it, but nothing worked. The Penny would always show up the next day in my pocket, or tucked away in the corner of my purse. Before long, my life was even worse than my Dad’s.



I thought about ending it, *ya know*, but I figured that would just go wrong too. I thought I’d try something different instead.



“Hey, you must be Jody,” Westley, my date, says, and then adds, “you got a great pair of tits.”



“Thanks,” I utter through a forced smile.



You see, I *know* that Westley is bad news, and not just because I reached out to all his exes (the alive ones anyway). 



The fact that he showed up to this date without something going wrong is all the proof I need to know that he is the *worst possible outcome*.



“Hey, why don’t we go get something a little stronger than coffee?” I suggest, shaking my half-empty cup.



It doesn’t take much to convince him, especially when I offer to be the designated driver.



We’ll go to a bar, have a few drinks, and then I’ll drive back to his place. The whole way home he’ll think he’s getting *lucky*, but a block from his home we’ll get into a horrible car accident.



I know this because it *always* happens that way. 



Every. Single. Time.



I’ll live, of course, but he won’t.

Certain foods and drinks can potentially reduce the effectiveness of Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts), particularly immediate-release formulations. Here's a breakdown based on the provided search results: 
1. Acidic Foods and Drinks:
Citrus fruits and juices: The high vitamin C content and overall acidity can hinder the absorption of Adderall in the digestive system.
Other acidic foods and drinks: This includes coffee, carbonated beverages, energy drinks, and certain sports drinks.
Mechanism: Increased acidity in the stomach can reduce the absorption of immediate-release amphetamines. Additionally, acidic urine can increase the excretion of amphetamines, leading to lower blood levels and potentially reduced effectiveness. 
2. High-Fat Meals:
Delayed absorption: High-fat meals can delay the time it takes for some extended-release amphetamine salts (like Adderall XR) to reach peak concentration in the body.
Potential impact on XR formulations: One study showed a significant decrease in Adderall XR levels during the first few hours after a heavy breakfast. ",3,1749750751.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

A little context:
I go to art school, it's 8k a year and i have 3 remaining years to do, I managed to get money from the bank to pay my years (except the last one) my country (i live in france 🇨🇵) gives me 100€ every month to live, my mom gives me 100 too (already told her she could stop if she needed) my rent 700€ my mom pays half (so 350€) and my fiancé the other half.
She pays for the electricity and my fiancé pays for the insurance, we half and half the wifi (because i need ot for school and my 4g has really bad reception at home) he mostly pays for the groceries but i help so i can have as much money as possible to put on the side to pay my last year (i saved 2k for now)
Just a quick note, my mom earns 3k something a month my fiancé earns minimal wage (so less than half what my mom earns) my mom's car was given by her company, she doesn't pay gas either, she owns a house and lives alone, has ac in every room and her giant fridge is always filled.
She blames ME for not being able to find a job for this summer, I've applied to at least 100 jobs, most online but at least 20 in person, since march, no responses. The only calls i get are scam calls and ads.

So now she said that she won't be paying rent for two month, that if I don't have a job by july she'll be taking money in my savings (she created my account so she has access to my money and i need her to have access to my money)
My fiancé (this sweetheart) said he'll be paying the full rent, but with all our expenses (rent, wifi, food, insurance, Spotify etc) mainly small things but it doesn't leave a lot for groceries, so if we want to still be able to do fun things (we always go for the cheapest things even when we're not struggling) we will need to cut on groceries, if we can even afford them.

I told that to my mom, that it's not my fault if people don't want me. every year since i turned 18 (still lived with my mom at that time) I've applied for summer jobs because i did( and still do) 8a.m to 6p.m of school EVERYDAY, if we don't even count the homework pilling up
I work everyday from 8 a.m to 11.30 p.m with like 1h break for my sanity and to eat (not counting the time i spend doing chores)
I don't have time for a job during the school year.
But nobody seems to want a worker for just two month of the year.

I'm trying commissions but I'm struggling (will use all my time to promote my art and stuff) my mom says it won't pay my rent, but 70€ here and there can definitely pay groceries. 
I jokingly said ""because if i don't do that i won't have any food to eat this summer"" and this b**** said ""well maybe that'll make you lose weight !""

Note that I'm on testosterone so of course I'm gaining weight ! Since I've started testosterone, I've been eating healthier and less than with my mom. And also guess what ? *ding ding ding* I have an eating disorder. And guess who's fault it is ? You guessed it : my mother.
All my life she ate half i did, she was never hungry, always saying she was soooo fat and ugly, and waited for me to tell her that she wasn't fat and that she was pretty, taking meds to lose weight, always controlling what i ate (we barely ate red meat because ""it's bad for you"" while i had an iron deficiency)

Btw last year we fed ourselves with only iced coffee and salads for the whole summer. We would spend some days n'y drinking coffee to keep us awake. And guess who didn't lose weight ? Me. Because even with an ed i know that starving yourself will only het you fatter once you eat. (My fiancé was still looking for a job at that point and was making money dog sitting, which we might do again this year (we have a dog and did that to socialize her)

Anyway i probably forgot to say stuff but whatever right now i just wanted to let the rage out of my mom being happy I'll probably starve this summer ✌️

I've struggled with social anxiety and body image issues since forever. I tried SSRIs (Lexapro, Paxil) but they either didn't help much or caused side effects.

I discovered gabapentin's benefits completely by accident - I had surgery that required a nerve blocker (that's its main use), and my partner noticed I seemed much calmer and more functional during recovery (despite obviously recovering from a major surgery). When I figured out it was the gabapentin I talked to my doctor and she prescribed it (off label) for anxiety at 100mg twice daily (which is actually a really low dose- so it's amazing that it helps at that dosing). It's considered a ""second line"" medicine and most doctors don't know about it.

Things I've noticed:

* Social situations feel like 10% more manageable (I've been going to stores/coffee shops alone)
* The 'volume' of overwhelm and inner criticism turned way down which gives me room to actually think
* Better sleep and more patience with myself
* For me it lasts about 8 hours, so I have to take it 2-3 times a day

Every morning they woke up stiff, tired, and groggy—Sarah with a sore neck and Mike with nagging lower back pain.

One Saturday, they walked into **Mattress Firm on 41st Street**, greeted warmly by a Sleep Expert who asked about their sleep struggles. After listening carefully, the expert recommended the **PranaSleep mattress**—known for its luxurious comfort, exceptional support, and natural materials.

“PranaSleep? Never heard of it,” Mike admitted.

The Sleep Expert explained that the mattress used **natural Talalay latex**, which cradled pressure points and kept the spine perfectly aligned. It was also **hypoallergenic, breathable**, and—best of all—durable enough to last over a decade without sagging.

Sarah was especially thrilled to learn the bed wouldn’t trap heat like their old foam mattress. Mike loved that it would isolate movement so her tossing and turning wouldn’t wake him up.

They laid on it for a few minutes in the store—and knew immediately this was **the one**.

A week later, their PranaSleep arrived. That first night? Magic. Sarah slept straight through till sunrise, waking refreshed and pain-free. Mike’s backache was gone by the third morning.

“Why didn’t we do this years ago?” he joked as they enjoyed morning coffee in bed, smiling.

From that day forward, they actually **looked forward to bedtime**—thanks to the PranaSleep mattress from Mattress Firm.

1l9sl2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuenosAires/comments/1l9sl2q/my_palermo_medialuna_crawl/,My Palermo Medialuna Crawl,"Good morning! I spent this morning doing a little medialuna crawl in Palermo, and the results are in!

[3 medialunas from different cafes\/bakeries in Palermo](https://preview.redd.it/bek7reo15j6f1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093e1bc971d13b3e5af9cd3ef14ec9b8a7bf6385)

The verdict is....

* Medialunas are great!
* 3 medialunas are definitely not too many medialunas

Okay, but some specifics, from left to right.

**Ispica:** 

* About the cafe: Over several weeks of trying cafes in Palermo, this became my neighborhood favorite cafe. This place has the best medialuna/coffee combo in town. They have some great lunch-ish items, too, if you steer clear of the unhinged blue cheese toast. 1500 pesos for the medialuna.
* The Medialuna:
   * Pros:
      * Extreme butter flavor
      * Stretchy, very soft. Crispy top contrasts nicely with very soft bottom.
      * Good balance of caramelization and butter flavor
      * Served re-warm (which is why it's deflated in photo)
   * Cons:
      * I guess this medialuna could be a little gummy for some people. I personally loved the stretch/chew, but someone might not want that.



**Amasadero:**

* About the bakery: This is a fancy artisanal bakery. This medialuna was huge (more of a luna llena if you know what I'm sayin') and 2000 pesos.
* Pros:
   * Deep caramelization flavor from a darker bake (if you want that in a medialuna?)
   * Good butter flavor
* Cons:
   * Caramelization could be a little distracting from the honey/butter flavors.
   * This was kind of just a croissant, even though they also sold actual croissants. Flaky, dark, drier than a medialuna. Kind of curious if they're different.

**Guber:**

* About the bakery: very popular here on Reddit, and recommended by locals from language meetups. Not remembering the price of the medialuna.
* Pros:
   * Awesome, bouncy, soft structure. More brioche-like. Similar texture all the way through.
   * Honey coating is thicker, and the medialuna was sweeter overall.
   * Structure maintained extremely well after re-heat, but was also great not reheated.
* Cons:
   * Less butter flavor
   * Honey coating had a few goop spots that were actual goop, and this medialuna might be a little too sweet for some people
   * Not about the medialuna, but the coffee here wasn't awesome.

  
Overall, I'd go back to Guber and Ispica. The medialuna at Amasadero was good, but if I wanted a croissant I'd order a croissant. I went back to Ispica over and over because both the medialuna and the coffee were so great. Guber was definitely a little more iconic, though, and I kept going back for another bite!",3,1749749696.0,BuenosAires,6,1.0,False

Celebrity gossip or trash-type podcasts also work (smth like cancelled).

1l9sga1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l9sga1,I lost 20lbs in 3(ish) months. Here’s how.,"I turned 39 earlier this year and I was at my heaviest I’ve ever been. I weighed in at 185lbs in January. Now, I know that’s not “huge” by any means, but I could see it in the mirror. My face was round, i was getting a serious case of the dadbod/beer belly and I hadn’t worked out seriously in YEARS. I used to be pretty active, playing rec league soccer and running the occasional half marathon. 

My wife booked us a beach vacation and I knew that I didn’t want to be fat dad on the beach. I also put it in my head that I wanted to be in better shape at 40 than I was at 30. 

So I got to work.

First thing I did was download an app called Lose It! It calculates your calorie intake, your protein macros, etc to help you stay on track with dieting. Here’s the thing: Peter Attia, MD (author of Outlive) says that there’s only one diet program that actually helps lose weight—calorie restriction. Not intermittent fasting, not food restriction (think keto, adkins). Just plain old “eat less than you burn.”

After inputting my goal weight, age and information, it gave me a daily calorie budget of 1400 calories. I know that seems like very little, and in a lot of ways it was. But in so many other ways, it was perfect. By the way, you can eat a metric shit ton of chicken, broccoli and rice on 1400cal/day. I still enjoyed a beer every now and then, and the Lose It! app also calculates your exercise calories burned and applies those to your daily calorie limit, so you could ostensibly do a good 300 calorie workout in the morning and crush a couple of beers that evening and be in good standing. 

A typical day of food is:
Breakfast: strawberry banana smoothie with vanilla whey protein and Greek yogurt. About 400 calories. 

Lunch: chicken wrap in lavash with spinach and cheese. 400 calories.

Dinner: chicken breast cooked in a bit of zero calorie olive oil spray with broccoli and cauliflower. 250-300 calories

Snack: banana, Greek yogurt, strawberries, something along those lines. 


The next thing I did was hit the gym. I’m not trying to be a bodybuilder, so I didn’t do standard isometric chest pumping barbell bench presses or curls. I grabbed the kettlebell. 

Three days per week (Mon, Tue, Thur), I grabbed a 20kb kettlebell and did swings, squats, snatches, all kinds of plyometric movements. The goal wasn’t to just gain muscle (which I did) but to burn calories and get stronger and leaner. 

When the 20kg bell felt like it wasn’t giving me enough, i moved up to a 24kg bell. I’m currently using a 32kb one (70.5lbs) for swings and goblet squats but still using 24kgs for things like snatches and overhead presses. 

A typical workout is: 100 swings, 50 snatches (25 each arm) 50 goblet squats and 50 overhead presses. Sometimes I’ll turn the snatch and press into a snatch and thruster combo, which combines the overhead presses and squats into a serious calorie-burning movement. I finish it all off with 100 pushups. Takes about 30 minutes and leaves me drenched and feeling strong. 

I drank a ton of water every day. Tried to get a gallon, fell short a lot. Coffee was just black coffee, but i would put a splash of low calorie creamer in it for some extra flavor. Absolutely stay away from milk-based coffee drinks. Calorie bombs with no nutritional value. 

The final part of my workout plan was to start running again. I ran 3.1 miles three days/week (Sun, Wed, Fri) either on a treadmill or around the neighborhood. Those 3.1miles generally take anywhere from 28-34 minutes. I’m not racing anyone, I’m just burning calories and getting my aerobic fitness up. 

And that’s it. Kettlebells and running. Calorie restriction, focusing on clean, protein-forward whole foods. I am beach-ready and I feel better than ever. But most importantly, i don’t get winded playing and running around with my 5yo daughter, and im looking forward to hanging out on the beach with my wife and little girl. 

I hope this helps any of you other dads on here looking to start getting into shape or getting back into shape after kids. I’ve attached some before/after pics. ",115,1749749377.0,daddit,53,0.84,False

Brew some coffee, kick back, and give this a read.

Please help boost Etherealize's [announcement tweet](https://x.com/etherealize_io/status/1933148258768929165)

**Why is this important?**

- It refocuses ETH to be recognized as a store of value and priced as a commodity (rather than stupid valuations like DCF)
- ETF providers have claimed they haven't been pushing ETH because they didn't know how to market it (I know, pathetic). Now there's a playbook with a clear narrative for ETF providers, family offices, account managers, etc to use for marketing ETH.
- News outlets will now have educated and consistent messaging to use when talking about ETH and Ethereum.
- It provides united messaging to others in the ecosystem to use and hammer home.
- This is being distributed globally with content in multiple languages.

**Why digital oil?**

- This is the narrative that Etherealize found resonated the most when talking to institutions. I was hesitant about this at first since it's something that has been around for a while, but the key thing that changed that viewpoint was the shift from focusing on just fees as was done in the past to expanding it to focus on the commodity aspects. HOpefully this report will help convince anyone else that was initially apprehensive as well.

**What now?**

- What's most important now is that we unite as a community and rally behind this messaging as a community. This will be used as a bible to spread the gospel of ETH with united messaging. We need to hammer home this messaging the same way bitcoiners do.
- Help write content around this and share content that others are creating. Lets support each other in spreading this messaging.
- The day is not over. Etherealize will be on Bankless today to discuss this report and Base has some big announcements around 10am.

\
(Worthy Satire) - In a bold new prediction, Elon Musk proclaimed that by 2040, ""tens of billions"" of humanoid robots will populate the Earth — a number slightly higher than the planet’s total square footage and about 30 billion more than the current human population.\
\
“Humans are overworked,” Musk tweeted. “Robots don’t unionize, never need coffee breaks, and most importantly — they don’t launch three-hour podcasts about hustle culture.”\
\
Musk says the bots will be powered by Tesla software, run on Optimus energy cores, and come pre-installed with X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) so they can argue with each other in real time.\
\
When asked if humanity might feel threatened, Musk replied, “Oh, I think humans just need a long-overdue break — maybe a few decades off while the robots handle things.”\
\
The World Economic Forum applauded the move, saying it would allow humans to “own nothing, do nothing, and finally relax” — all while quietly drafting plans to run the world unchallenged by a society too lazy to notice.\
\
As for Musk? He’s reportedly developing the next big leap: a more efficient, less sleep-deprived version of himself called eLon-2.0 — freeing up the original to finally focus on planning his long-awaited escape to Mars.\
\
“I’m tired,” he said. “Let the bots figure it out.”\
\
Worthy Satire is meant purely for comedic purposes—after all, as Proverbs reminds us, “Laughter is good medicine.” But behind every satire is a real story, video, or event. For the unspun version of the headline, be sure to check out the original source.  \

Don't get me wrong, I have no issues cooking for someone, but kinda feel like the invite should come from me and not as a strong suggestion from him. It feels a bit weird. 

For clarity, he's part of the FIRE movement so he has plenty of money and isn't hungry, I assume. He's made it clear that although he would like intimacy with me, he's fine with just kissing and cuddling (since we didn't yet) and he isn't expecting anything more.... so he says...

Every year, our library has a summer reading program for adults as well as kids.  Prizes for adults include free books from the discard box, coffee mugs with the library logo, etc.  This year, rather than awarding points per title read, the program is awarding points per minute read.

The rules specifically mention that audiobooks are included as reading.

If I listen to an audiobook at 2x speed, do I log twice the amount of time I actually spend?  For example, if I listen to an hour of a book sped up twice as fast, should I log that as two hours?

I argue that since I read traditional books extremely quickly, I was essentially logging twice as many titles last summer as I would have if I read them more slowly.

My spouse argues that I should only count the actual amount of time that has passed on the clock.

As librarians (and fellow library lovers), please weigh in!  The fate of a library-branded pen hangs in the balance!

Edit: Thank you all for showing me the error of my ways!  Fortunately, I have the ability to adjust my logged reading, so I'll go back and fix what I logged since signing up on Tuesday.  I suppose I'll have to be content with two library pens instead of four.  The loss will be hard, but I shall strive to carry on somehow.

Hope the week has been going well for you so far. Most of my friends are travelling at various points this summer, and I find myself with a bunch of free time. I'm looking to expand my social circle and meet new people. Ideally, someone I can do various activities with - like watching movies at the cinema together, checking out new cafes and restaurants, going on walks around downtown this summer, playing sports and/or going to the gym together. I'd describe myself as an ambivert, so I also enjoy spending time at home. I live in Downtown Toronto and can host. If you're into cuddling and enjoy watching movies/TV shows, then we'd be a great match. I love being the big spoon, but I'd also be keen on trying out other cuddle positions once we get to know each other better.

My work schedule during the week is from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., so I've plenty of free time in the evenings and on weekends. I'm an easygoing person who enjoys deep conversations, good food, coffee, and I'm looking to make a new meaningful connection.

1l9s2qu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l9s2qu,1969 Plymouth Road Runner – The Muscle Car That Put Simplicity on the Map,"The 1969 Road Runner was never meant to be glamorous—it was built to be fast, loud, and stripped-down. A blue-collar muscle car with a big-block soul. Introduced in 1968 as a performance-focused offshoot of the Belvedere, the Road Runner proved that Americans didn’t need frills to burn rubber. By its second year, it was a sensation, with Plymouth moving over **84,000 units**, including **nearly 49,000 hardtops**, just like the one we’re showcasing now.

While the base models were already a blast with 383s, the upper-tier variants like the **440 Six-Pack** and the rare **426 HEMI** were monsters on the street—today, those top-spec cars fetch **well over $100K** when well-preserved or restored. Even mid-tier builds with performance upgrades like this one are increasingly rare finds.

What makes the example we’re featuring so interesting isn’t that it’s just another numbers-matching survivor—it’s a full-blown drag-strip bruiser with attitude. Painted in a near-black **deep purple metalflake**, it hides a **440 CID V8** that’s been bored .030” over and stuffed with **Diamond pistons**, **Eagle rods**, a **Callies crank**, **ported Edelbrock RPM heads**, and topped with a **giant BDS blower and dual Holley 4BBLs**. Oh—and there’s a **NOS plate system** too, if you're brave enough to tap into it.

It’s got the look to match the hardware: **ghost flames**, **tubbed rear**, **33x18.5” Mickey Thompsons**, **roll cage**, and a race-ready **reverse manual valve body 727** backed by a **Dana 60** with 4.88 gears. Inside? All business—AutoMeter gauges, racing harnesses, line-lock, and a switch panel that hints this car was built for more than just Cars & Coffee.

Is it a faithful restoration of a showroom-spec Road Runner? Absolutely not. But that’s what makes this one so exciting to look at. It captures what the Road Runner name always promised: brutal simplicity, unapologetic performance, and zero fluff. This is the kind of car that would’ve made your uncle the king of the Friday night strip.

🛠️ Builds like this aren’t common to find in the wild, especially wrapped in such an iconic Mopar shell. The vintage drag scene is growing, and so is the appreciation for muscle cars that weren’t afraid to evolve beyond factory specs. With Road Runner values trending upward year over year—especially for big-block and custom builds—cars like this are catching more eyes and commanding more respect.

🔍 **Market Snapshot:**

* Current median auction prices at \~$45K overall, \~$41K for coupes, \~$48K for convertibles—and a high-end ceiling of $275K for exceptional Hemi cars.
* Current listing averages hovering around **$75K**, with extreme examples reaching $275K.
* Since \~2019, values have steadily risen—demand for vintage Mopars continues to climb .

Beyond numbers, the Road Runner remains cultural iconography: a raw, honest expression of American performance. While early Camaro and Mustang fans chase appearances, many Mopar purists still prefer the visceral punch of a big‑block Road Runner.

I became a nutritionist in the quest to figure out my obesity situation. I did all sorts of stuff only to end up almost back at square one but not quite. 

After spending many hours reading through everything here (amazing minds!), I feel your insight could be helpful, so here we go. 

At my heaviest I was over 300lbs and at my lowest 138lbs. I am 5'5.  I maintained between 180-210 for over a decade and after a major and traumatic life event, I am at 239 at 39years of age facing bariatric surgery in 2 months as a last resort. 

I developed a condition they call Lipedema post covid and the pain is pretty intense and sensitive to heat. 

After going through all of my journals, notes and such, I realize that every time I had success it was fat free. I reached my lowest weight doing  0% Fat VLCD. It took like 9 months. I had no loose skin. But I was completely depleted as I lived on fat free chicken, beef and fish, black coffee and apples. Nothing else. 

Another successful round was the McDougall diet. I stopped that out of boredom but it was working well. 

My recent gain are from losing mobility due to the lipedema situation plus depression, anemia, joint pain and hashimotos. 

Classic. I know. u_u literally what I was trying to avoid lol. 

I don't eat junk food or eat out. The PUFA I am exposed to is avocado oil which we use very little of when we cook BUT we do eat alot of salads with EVOO. 

As a family we are meticulous about sourcing and have slaughtered our own animals many times to get clean protein .

I don't really see how a gastric sleeve would help someone like me other than resetting microbiome and vagus nerve connections/pathways, which are pretty powerful changes. BUt my eating habits are clean ones, my caloric intake is usually 1500-1700.

I feel it could be helpful to ensure I don't creep up as fast in any case I find myself in another crazy life event. Obesity has been a thing for me since I was 8 so even if I thin out, I have to prevent gains like this from happening ever again. I am just not 100% sure this is the way. 

Recently I did 60 days of just counting calories and doing 70-100g protein, 150g carbs and 50-60g of fat. I dropped about 10 lbs and have been stuck since. 

I am taking Tyromix and Cortinon recommended by my ND. I had 2 iron infusions and am now at normal levels. 

What I am wanting to do moving forward is a starch based 80-10-10 and just let my body get rid of all the excess fat and lipedema tissue for me. I don't even know if that's possible, but the pain is intense enough that I am willing to try. My case isn't as bad as some I have seen, but damn does it hurt. 

The lipedema community highly suggests keto, however, I don't thrive with keto. My body just doesn't take to it very well, its very expensive for me and my gall bladder is full of stones (taking ursadiol and some herbs to try and break the stones).

What other changes ore recommendations would you have for someone like myself?

He had two brothers: Stefan (23) and Chris (31). Stefan and I always got along great, we became real friends. Chris, on the other hand, was… different. A bit of a loner, socially awkward, never had a girlfriend. I always suspected he might be on the spectrum, or just a really intense nerd. He had this odd vibe about him. 

Chris was cold and dismissive towards me from the start. I honestly tried to connect with him for years, especially after I married his brother at 23. He was never outright hostile, but he obviously didn’t like me. At our wedding, instead of celebrating, he sat by a window, completely isolated, reading a book. That pretty much sums it up.

Over the years, we started to talk more, and things seemed to ease a bit between us. Fast forward to year 11 of our marriage, I was around 32. One day, Chris came by the house while my husband was at work, just to pick something up. It wasn’t unusual. We ended up having coffee and chatting. Nothing weird… until it suddenly got weird.

Out of nowhere, he tells me he doesn’t want to spend time with me anymore. I was stunned and asked why. I thought things had finally become normal between us. That’s when he told me he’d been in love with me the entire time.

I honestly thought I misheard him. My brain just blanked. I remember blinking at him in silence, like it wasn’t real life. This was my brother-in-law, the guy who barely tolerated me, who always kept his distance telling me he’d secretly loved me for over a decade.
He began crying and excused himself. I wasn’t able to respond properly. I mean, like what was I supposed to say?! We never talked about it again. And 2 years later I divorced my husband and had no contact with him since then. 
But that moment? That confession? It shook me in a way I’ve never forgotten. It’s one of the most surreal things I’ve ever experienced. Like finding out your cat has been in love with you and suddenly starts talking. Just… unreal.",23,1749748216.0,offmychest,9,1.0,False

Here are the reasons none of you are making any money based on what I saw:

1- You just want to copy what others do for an easy win. 

Maybe the most common question that I got was about the specifics of what niches im in, and I get how you want to know what kind of niches are popular and working. But this isn't the way you're supposed to do that, its not like a good reason for you to open a new account is because you saw a random reddit post talking about this niche. What worked for me a year and a half a go might not work for you today.

2- You expect to be spoonfed all the information. 

This is probably the most important point, the amount of people that just came in and said ""Teach me your ways"" or ""Tell me step by step what you did"" is concerning. In reality, no one can really teach you how to make money online, not even courses, as everyone has his own pathway and a course that is for everyone probably works on none (Mentorships work though as they're personalized)
I tried to reply to as many people as I can but its just impossible to reply to everyone.

3- You dont invest in yourself.

The market now is very competitive for you to just learn things on your own. Most of you want to get rich by next month but wont learn the skills you need to. As if you'll magically teach yourself how to edit your videos and go viral with them as soon as you start, without putting the time or money into learning it. You'd rather just spend 5$ per day on coffee instead of buying that 40$ editing course that'll set you up to generate thousands later on. Get your priorities straight


4- You focus on too many money making ways.

You probably just see a way someone made 30k a month and immediatly get drawn to it and considering how many people here post just to get you to press their link or their product, you're definetly not making any progress in any. The truth is all of the ways people make money in are legit, the problem is that you never committed to one long enough to actually see results. Dont just follow what a random redditor did to get 30k a month. Instead, make a list of the ways people make money and write pros and cons of each and settle on one and go all in on it. It will probably work with time



5- You expect to make 10k by next week

Success and making money is a gradual process, you wont reach 10k per month until you surpass 1k per month and 5k per month first. You start by making money first and then scaling to more money",0,1749747995.0,passive_income,1,0.5,False

We had come home from getting coffee and groceries, and he had told me he was going to play some more. I, not normally doing so, stood my ground and said it hurt my feelings and that he had already done so today. I stated I wanted to spend time together. I asked if he wanted to help put the groceries away. He then grabbed my throat and told me that I was going to “put the groceries away like a ‘good girl’”. Now, for context, we DO participate in stuff like this in the bedroom. However, we were arguing, no where near heading that way, and I was clearly NOT turned on. I was scared.

Ever felt that mid-afternoon slump, even after your second- or third-cup of coffee? You know, the one where your brain feels like it's wading through treacle and you'd do anything for just five more minutes of sleep? We've all been there. For many of us, caffeine is the go-to solution, a quick fix to jolt us awake. But here's the thing- while a morning brew can be a delightful ritual, relying on it for consistent energy can lead to jitters, crashes, and disrupted sleep.

What if I told you there's a better way? A way to tap into your body's *natural* energy reserves, feeling vibrant and focused without the caffeine roller coaster? That's where biohacking comes in. It's about understanding your body's systems and giving them what they need to perform optimally. I've been on this journey myself, and I've found that by implementing some simple, proven biohacks, you can significantly reduce- or even eliminate- your dependence on caffeine. Ready to reclaim your natural energy? Let's dive in.

## Your Natural Energy Toolkit: 10 Biohacks That Work

These aren't magic pills- they're practical steps you can start taking today. Consistency is key, but the payoff is incredible.

### 1. Embrace Morning Sunlight

This is one of my favorite, and arguably simplest, biohacks. As soon as you wake up, get some natural light into your eyes. Step outside for 10-15 minutes, or at least open your curtains and look out a window. What's fascinating is that this signals to your brain that it's daytime, helping to regulate your circadian rhythm. It lowers melatonin production and starts your body's natural cortisol awakening response- a healthy, natural energy boost, unlike the artificial jolt from caffeine. I've found it truly makes a difference in my morning alertness.

### 2. Hydrate Like Your Life Depends On It

Seriously, it almost does! Dehydration is a surprisingly common cause of fatigue. Even mild dehydration can make you feel sluggish, unfocused, and just plain tired. Start your day with a big glass of water- I like to add a pinch of sea salt for electrolytes. Keep a water bottle handy throughout the day and sip regularly. You might be surprised how much better you feel when you're properly hydrated. It's foundational.

### 3. Take a Cold Shower (or Cold Splash)

Okay, I know what you're thinking- ""Brrr!"" But hear me out. A quick blast of cold water- even just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower- can be incredibly invigorating. It boosts circulation, increases alertness, and can even trigger a natural release of endorphins. It's a mental wake-up call, too, teaching your body to adapt to stress. In my experience, it's a phenomenal way to shake off morning grogginess and feel ready to tackle the day.

### 4. Move Your Body, Even Just a Little

You don't need to run a marathon every morning to feel energized. Even 10-15 minutes of light exercise- a brisk walk, some stretching, a few jumping jacks- can work wonders. Movement gets your blood flowing, delivers oxygen to your brain, and releases feel-good endorphins. It's a natural mood and energy enhancer. I've found that a quick morning walk sets a positive tone for the whole day.

### 5. Harness the Power of Breathwork

This one is actually pretty cool. Specific breathing exercises can profoundly impact your energy levels. Techniques like box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) or even just deep belly breathing can calm your nervous system, reduce stress, and increase oxygen flow, leading to sustained energy. I've used breathwork during afternoon slumps and it's amazing how quickly it can clear brain fog.

### 6. Fuel Your Body with Nutrient-Dense Foods

What you eat directly impacts your energy. Ditching processed foods, sugary snacks, and refined carbs can prevent those infamous blood sugar spikes and crashes that leave you feeling drained. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods: plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Think eggs and avocado for breakfast, a big salad with chicken for lunch, and salmon with roasted veggies for dinner. Stable blood sugar equals stable energy.

### 7. Practice Strategic Napping

Now, I'm not talking about a two-hour snooze fest. A strategic power nap- typically 10-20 minutes- can be incredibly restorative. The key is to keep it short enough to avoid falling into deep sleep, which can leave you feeling groggier than before. I've found that a 15-minute nap can sometimes be more effective than another cup of coffee for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.

### 8. Cultivate Mindfulness and Meditation

Stress is a huge energy drainer. Chronic stress can lead to adrenal fatigue and a constant feeling of being ""wired but tired."" Incorporating a daily mindfulness practice, even just 5-10 minutes of meditation, can significantly reduce stress levels. It helps calm your mind, improve focus, and conserve mental energy. Think of it as charging your internal battery.

### 9. Prioritize Gut Health

This might sound a bit out there, but your gut health is intimately connected to your energy levels. Your gut microbiome influences everything from nutrient absorption to neurotransmitter production. A healthy gut can lead to better digestion, less inflammation, and improved mood and energy. Eating fermented foods (like kimchi or sauerkraut), plenty of fiber, and considering a good probiotic can make a world of difference.

### 10. Optimize Your Sleep Hygiene

This is arguably the most critical biohack for sustained energy. It's not just about getting 7-9 hours of sleep; it's about *quality* sleep. Create a consistent sleep schedule, make your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet, and avoid screens for at least an hour before bed. Good sleep allows your body to repair and rejuvenate, providing a deep well of natural energy for the next day. I've learned that a consistent sleep routine is non-negotiable for feeling my best.

But by incorporating these 10 biohacks into your daily routine, you'll be amazed at how quickly your body adapts and starts producing its own steady, clean energy. You'll experience fewer crashes, better mood, improved focus, and a deeper sense of well-being. It's about empowering your body to thrive naturally.

1l9roc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1l9roc8/big_summer_blowout_long_desperate/,"Big summer blowout <LONG, Desperate>","I moved into a house for seven after moving halfway across the country. Everything seemed great at first and I even made fast friends with my housemates. We had a couple people who were inconsiderate- dying jeans in the kitchen sink, taking two one-hour+ showers each day, smoking in the house, things like that.


I helped out with cleaning, doing the most of it. I enjoyed it and most of the house members weren’t all that messy. Just the normal amount. One of them was particularly upset by the mess and asked me to help organize a cleaning effort- which I ended up heading. 


I ironed out a deal with the landlord (some of us are Airbnb guests for 1 month-about 4 months) for me to be paid to be a sort of house manager/maintenance/cleaner. I know, I fucked that up. As you probably guessed it got to a point where I was completely burnt out by the whole setup. I just wanted to live in my house, not work in it. 

So I waited for the right time (sink jean dye job and water bill destroyer) had moved out, so there wasn’t really anything for me to do anymore, and “quit”. I kept cleaning, operating under the idea of “make a mess, clean a mess” and “leave things better than when you found them when you can” but things still weren’t working out for me. At this point I was doing “extra” cleaning before I decided that I cared too much and adjusted my expectations. Every time I’d clean I’d just wind up disappointed because it felt like I was the only one putting in effort. So I just started taking care of my own messes and doing little things when I felt like it.  I want stoked about it but I felt at peace about the situation for the first time in a while. 


This is where things went south south. (Two) people started complaining in the group chat and I shrugged it off because I knew I wasn’t doing anything that hindered the function of the house or made it anywhere near gross. Pollen season came and one of the two lowkey went off about how there was a bunch of pollen buds tracked into the house and it was because I was grilling and I didn’t sweep it up. 

I was going in and out of the house and I increased the amount that was brought in but the way she approached me about it made me feel weird, small. I brushed it off, swept and kept doing my thing because it made me realize that my own approach (before I stepped back) wasn’t the best either. 

After that it became constant. 
* hey you left something on the kitchen table for less than a day (there are seven spaces and there was plenty of room, in less than 12 hours she had complained about it 3 times. I was super busy the day after with two foster new kittens. It couldn’t be in my room overnight, which is the size of a large pantry/closet- for what it’s worth the housemate complaining has their own apartment in the house - minus a kitchen)
* why is this so messy? (There were 5 of those coupon single page newspapers you get in the mail on the mantle, I kept them there for kindling)
* I can’t even relax in the backyard anymore, it’s so messy it stresses me out (there was a coffee tin with ripped up cardboard in it for my grill that had blown over, I once left a plate out overnight. I don’t want to be petty but I’m the only reason there’s a table and chairs out there  
Etc. 

It came to a head when they approached me and just started laying on, despite me expressing my discomfort and bewilderment. At the same time they took the opportunity to double down and confront me about how I was previously organizing cleaning stuff and suddenly stopped without explanation. I was getting upset and admittedly a bit defensive when they went even further and chastised (yes, chastised) me for the way I was reacting to her “bringing up things that I’m doing wrong so we can have a better house”. 


I moved across the country to get away from my family who- despite telling me they were just trying to do the right thing and that they loved me, always made me feel bad about myself….and then made me feel worse about feeling bad. This felt so similar and it was coming from somebody who indirectly, subconsciously embodied me getting away from that- I know that sounds silly. I wound up crying and breaking down quietly in my room. I was so embarrassed, I tried so hard not to because I didn’t want to seem like “that guy”


More has happened since then and honestly got worse but I’m a bit overwhelmed typing this up so I’m going to stop here for now. I feel like I don’t have my two closest friends in this house anymore. I don’t want them. There was a huge argument and after the things that were/weren’t said I truly don’t have any interest in being friends with these two people anymore. I’m an emotional person and after they treated me that way I was just done. Had a short cry in private and then moved on. 

There was an apology from one of them but I don’t think it was genuine. it felt more like they realized I was serious and were afraid they wouldn’t have my help, kindness and emotional support anymore. 


Now I’m stuck being distant (but cordial) and still questioning whether I fucked it all up or not….and if I’m still fucking it up. I had a bad feeling about them in the beginning but tried to ignore it because I thought maybe I was being judgmental. I’m sorry for the state of this writing. I’ve been wanting to type this for over a month and this is the most coherent it’s been. I’m crushed by this situation and I’m desperate for help. 


I’m wondering if others have had similar experiences, advice or any suggestions for how to handle this? I can’t afford to move out. Thank you if you read this and again I’m sorry it’s such a mess. ",2,1749747597.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

1l9rn9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1l9rn9g/4_day_planification_on_conchal/,4 DAY PLANIFICATION ON CONCHAL,"Hi guys, Im David a costa rican local, just wanted to share a free planification I did to a costumer that is coming to conchal, yo can text me in case you want yours! pura vida!!!

**4 DAY PLANIFICATION LOCATION: PLAYA CONCHAL**   
  
**DAY 1: BEACH DAY AT PLAYA CONCHAL** You are on Costa Rica most beautiful Beach, this is the day for you to relax on the beach, you can rent some jet skis or rent a horse ride also, both of these activities are available on the beach, if you dont like that type of activities we also recommend you doing some snorkel you can see a lot of beautiful colorfull fishes around you wont regret!  
  
**DAY 2: WILDLIFE ENCOUNTER** Lets keep the beach a side for a day! Diamante eco Park Adventure is around 40 minutes from conchal is the best option to Discover Costa rica Wildlife on a safe way for your two kids, there are different packages, I will recommend you Wildlife encounterthis package does not include zipline or extreme activities and your kids will learn and discover beautiful especies and even interact with some of them, you can buy costa rican lunch over there also, that same day I recommend you getting the sunset around 5-6pm on the conchal beach, its stunning!   
  
**DAY 3: YOU CAN CHOOSE!** So today we have options, sice you have the car rental you have the liberty to choose where to go, you already had a wildlife encounter, already visit costa rican most beautiful beach so here are 2 options:  
  
**OPTION 1: VOLCANO ADVENTURE**You can travel to a full day tour full of experiences to rincon de la vieja where you can do horse back riding, zipline, waterslide on the JUNGLE!, hot springs with volcanic mud, cultural activities like pottery, coffee, chocolate, bakery and sugarcane, also a traditional costa rican lunch included  
  
**OPTION 2: BEACH HOPPING** This option is great to take advantage of your car rental, you are on the pacific coast and costa rican beaches are amazing here, what I will recommend you is making a road tour around 3 stunning beaches so we start at your hotel at playa conchal then move to:  
  
**Playa Flamingo:**Beach is stunning, clear water and white sand, also it has one of the best restaurant in my opinion, coco loco, this beach is a must!   
  
**Playa danta:**this beach contains one of the best towns in costa rica, its call “Las Catalinas” and  its a wonderful town based on the italian architecture .  
  
**Playa Tamarindo:** this beach is an awesome surf city full of wonderful people and chill vibes all around, great place to buy a little souvenir or an Ice cream, I need to say that tamarindo is very expensive so try to avoid having lunch  
  
DAY 4: **CHILL DAY… OR NO?**  
  
**You cant say you didnt have an Incredible Costa Rican vacations**!  
I dont think you guys still have energy so what I will recommend is going to stores to buy souvenirs, usually you can find souvenirs at supermarkets, eat some seafood at a nice restaurant near the hotel and passing the rest of the day on the beach and the pool in case you have, you can also even get a sunset boat tour I can set that up for you.but… if you still want some adventure I highly recommend you the rincon de la vieja adventure in case you did the beach hopping on day 3 in case you did the rincon de la vieja on day 3 so I will recomend beach hopping today! I hope you liked it, its a pleasure for me to help you guys, I can help you booking the tours, also the rent a car because I work with budget rent a car and get you a great price! ",1,1749747526.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I’m Lucio, I’m Italian and I live in Bangkok since more than 4 years. I’m 40 years old and I work in digital education and business consulting. I help salon owners — especially hair salons — to grow their business, make more money and improve their life.

My work is online and B2B. I travel sometimes between Italy and Thailand, but Bangkok is my base now. My girlfriend is Thai, so I feel really good here.

I’m looking to meet new people — digital nomads, entrepreneurs, or people working in online business, consulting, or e-commerce. I like to talk about business, but also enjoy simple things like coffee, dinners or good time together. Maybe even with partners, why not?

She had a bad night of 4.5 hrs of sleep and complains throughout the video. I’m sorry girl, it is rough, that is part of parenthood….just hard bc she also gloats and gives advice about how Jesse sleeps so well.

Alas.  FOMO is real.

But it's also made me wonder: is there any way to tell when a coffee is gone forever (at least for this harvest), and when is it just gone for now (as in: until the roaster cooks up some more)?  Obviously the roaster knows, but I'm figuring the folks at September aren't monitoring this thread :)  Is there a way for us consumers to figure it out?

Also: if anybody knows other roasters you can recommend who might still have some of those same beans, let me know.",6,1749747430.0,pourover,4,0.88,False
1l9rl9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/RaceAcrossTheWorldBBC/comments/1l9rl9z/my_updated_series_5_rankings/,MY UPDATED SERIES 5 RANKINGS,"These are just my opinions.

1. Darren & Alex- They are the absolute top of all competitors. I loved Alex's character arc where he went from a very sheltered life to finally learning what he wanted to do. I loved Darren's character arc as well where he learned to be a bit softer and more supportive above the 'suck it up' mentality.
2. Alfie & Owen- Alfie is literally me in every way (looks, personality, experiences) and I really enjoyed his and Owen's relationship which is probably one of the sweetest male friendships I've ever seen. However it was slightly hard to watch when Alfie would get slightly whiny.
3. Tricia & Cathie- I really enjoyed their funny lines and how they would interact with each other as lifetime friends. They reminded me of my mother and her friends who seem to be very like that (ready to have a good moan over a cup of coffee in cafe Nero).
4. Caroline & Tom- Call me wrong idrc. I liked Caroline and Tom from the start, they started out a bit hopeless but 5 hours out of Stanley park??? I loved their arcs into valuing each other so much more than they did before. Comments about being rich and their sob stories? I will just link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RaceAcrossTheWorldBBC/comments/1l4zsw7/about\_caroline\_and\_tom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaceAcrossTheWorldBBC/comments/1l4zsw7/about_caroline_and_tom/)
5. Bryan & Melvyn- They were funny and I know they are the nation's favourites. They had a nice bond and were in it for the crack and that was obvious and nice to watch. I don't know why but I didn't really take to them as much as everyone else, I would have been happy if they won though.
6. Natalie & Shamima- They were so fun and so bubbly. They had very funny one liners and whenever they crossed into another country and they started singing ""AZERBAIJANNN!!"" was really fun. I liked when they paid forward all the favours they blagged off strangers at the end by helping Josh and Felix back.
7. Harry & Emma- Emma was so sweet. ""I've got to see the cathedral!"" made my heart melt and the way she looked at everything with such child like wonder was so nice to watch. Harry was very sweet and I like how patient he was with her when she was slow at walking. 
8. Monique & Ladi- Monique was such a diva. Her one liners were so funny and made me cry laughing quite a lot of the time. Ladi seems to be such an interesting character and a literal saint. They were really sweet together. 
9. Jo & Sam- Sorry for their loss. When they left the series, it was one of two reasons that make that series hard to watch for me. I really wanted them to get very far and so it's very frustrating when they are spending big on air-conditioned buses but obviously they are contending against ADHD/ADD/Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-d young adult so I kind of get it. The Boxing Day tsunami story is my Roman Empire.
10. Dom & Lizzie- They had lovely growth. Lizzie growing from a shy and introverted girl who didn't really know what she wanted to someone who could be more sociable and not be afraid to get people's attention was lovely to watch especially when she had to care for Dom who had a seizure. It was slightly frustrating at the beginning when they would bicker with each other but I was also cry laughing at the same time.
11. Yin & Gaz- icl would be so much higher had they made it further in the race. 
12. Zainab & Mobeen- They were fun. Their argument in episode 5 was slightly frustrating but they presented themselves well and I liked the 'adoption story' as I'd never seen that being talked much before (until Betty and James). I also found the whole 'muslims on a conservative Christian ranch' thing very funny.
13. Betty & James- They were very sweet. The whole 'MRKH hug' situation left me crying for them and I enjoyed James's mentality towards competitiveness. However, god, was there anything they haven't forgotten that series?
14. Tony & Elaine- I used to dislike them but I really have taken to them more now. They had many funny one liners and they were competitive but in a way that was fun to watch and not frustrating. The ""Yorkshireman, short arms deep pockets"" thing that Tony had was very fun. 
15. Josh & Felix- These two were nice. They always seemed to make a laugh out of any situation and I liked how they viewed everything with a lot of wonder. The argument in Hanoi left me cry laughing though. 
16. Jen & Rob- I really liked these two and felt sorry that they didn't win. I also liked how self aware Jen was about how she came across on the series (""checkpoint Jen"") and I felt that they hd a really sweet bond together.
17. Fin & Sioned- I liked these two. They frustrated me episodes 4-6 but they really had some nice growth after that. I just preferred a lot of other teams to them but I don't know what they are up against being in a tiny town in Wales with no TVs probably. 
18. Kelly & Jeremy- I'll group these with 19 in the same justification. I feel like had they done what they joked about on that series (grouping Jeremy with Jeff and Freddy with Kelly) I would like Jeff and Jeremy a lot more and Freddy and Kelly a lot less. Freddie was quite annoying, Kelly was quite annoying and loud, Jeff was very nice and so was Jeremy. As it is though, Jeff and Freddie's dynamic was sweet and Freddie had some nice growth- I still like Jeremy more on his own though. 
19. Jeff & Freddy- See above
20. Billy & Bonnie- They were fun. Interesting about the disability, a little bit irritating but I liked Bonnie a lot and their bond was nice.
21. Michael & Shuntelle- I really liked these two and they should have been higher but they didn't make it past episode 2. Even so, Shuntelle's character growth and resilience coming through a lot more was really sweet and I hope they are happy now. 
22. Brydie & Sharon- They were sweet, that's all I can really say. Oh, and did she have dyslexia? :|
23. Scott & Sam- I liked these two but I preferred everyone else- (maybe I also prefer regular people against celebs). 
24. Mel & Helene- They were very sweet. I liked them quite a bit but I thought that they weren't very remarkable and I prefer everyone else really. 
25. Jindha & Bindhu- I know they didn't make it very far at all (only to the Westernmost part of Germany) but I actually really liked them for the most part and would put them further only they didn't even make it to the end of the first episode. 
26. Elizabeth & Letitia- They started off well but then it felt like any time they wouldn't get 1st after that meant a very preppy/ego-knocked ""oooooh!"". It was jarring when every episode was a mention of either being separated for 9 years, losing the home, and Letitia being more reserved. 
27. Marc & Michael- They just seemed a bit frustrating. I think I may have liked them a little more had they have stayed but I did not like them really out of any of the teams that series and at the end of episode 3, I was happy they left. (At least until the next episode). 
28. Eugenie & Isabelle- Quite frustrating to watch from episodes 4-6. They only score higher than Stephen & Viv because they were better at the game.
29. Stephen & Viv- Started of quite frustrating but I began to like them a lot more. Stephen does seem to be an executive mansplainer and the type that goes to darkest Peru only to get annoyed nobody speaks English lol. 
30. Kola & Mary-Ellen- Relatively boring. I don't really remember what they even did.
31. Alex & Noel- Relatively boring. I hate when it comes down to a footrace between two people (especially Harry and Emma and like the Emon and Jamiul thing. Also say I'm bias about Alfie and Owen doing the same but they should have won by a few hours anyway- it was really a fault in the game which caused them to be behind). What even did they really do?
32. Sue & Claire- Relatively boring. They seemed sweet but I wasn't opposed to them going when they did. 
33. Emon & Jamiul- I didn't really like these two. I know a lot of people do like them but- (this might be to do with a cultural thing) it came across to me that Emon would always seem to lead and Jamiul would follow blindly even though Emon's only 11 years older and they are supposed to be a team. I can't remember if that changes but it felt like whenever Jamiul wanted to do something, Emon would do it ""for the kids"" and would then get painted a saint when he gave up things he enjoyed. Then also the whole 'cheating but not really cheating' incident ruined the series for me and I cannot rewatch that one knowing what happens- call me bitter but.
34. Kevin & Claudia- Oh My God. I hated these two. Kevin was always trying to one up his daughter. Claudia was always bitter that her parents ran a business and never had time for her. Kevin would spend too much on taxis. Claudia would cry. I'm sure they're lovely outside each others company but Jesus.

But what if you feel like your metabolism is crawling, making it hard to lose weight or stay energized? The good news is: you **don’t have to hit the gym** to get things moving. Here are **8 effective, science-backed tips** to help rev up your metabolism **without lifting a dumbbell**.

# 1. Start Your Day with Protein

Eating a protein-rich breakfast can kickstart your metabolism early in the day. Protein has a high **thermic effect**, meaning your body uses more energy to digest it compared to fats or carbs. Try eggs, Greek yogurt, or a protein smoothie.

>

# 2. Stay Hydrated with Cold Water

Water fuels your body’s basic functions—including metabolism. Drinking **cold water** may offer a tiny metabolism boost because your body burns calories to warm it up. Aim for **at least 8 glasses a day**, and consider swapping sugary drinks for water.

>

# 3. Sip on Green Tea or Black Coffee

Both drinks contain natural compounds that can help fire up metabolism. Green tea has **catechins**, while coffee’s **caffeine** can increase fat-burning processes temporarily.

>

# 4. Get More Sleep

Sleep deprivation can slow down your metabolism and mess with hunger hormones. Aim for **7–9 hours** of quality sleep each night to help your body repair, reset, and burn calories more efficiently.

>

# 5. Stand Up More Often

Sitting too long can lead to a sluggish metabolism. Try standing or walking for a few minutes every hour. Even small movements like stretching or pacing while on the phone make a difference.

>

# 6. Eat Smaller, Balanced Meals Throughout the Day

Spreading your meals across the day helps keep your metabolism steadily active. Focus on whole foods, healthy fats, lean proteins, and fiber-rich carbs to avoid energy crashes and cravings.

>

# 7. Spice Things Up

Hot peppers and spicy foods contain **capsaicin**, a compound that may give your metabolism a temporary boost. Even small amounts added to meals can make a difference over time.

>

# 8. Reduce Stress

Chronic stress leads to high levels of **cortisol**, a hormone that can slow metabolism and encourage fat storage. Practicing mindfulness, deep breathing, journaling, or simply taking breaks during your day can help calm your system.

>

# Final Thoughts

While fitness helps, it's not the only way to awaken a sluggish metabolism. With small lifestyle tweaks—like sleeping better, eating smarter, staying hydrated, and moving a little more—you can naturally support your metabolism and feel more energized every day.

I'm a Massachusetts-based upcycler who creates designs on secondhand sweatshirts using scrap fabric. My bestselling design is called the Masshole Lobster — he has a cigarette in one claw and, in the other, a coffee cup with orange and pink DDs on it (alluding to a popular coffee chain...). Within the two years I've been making and selling this design, I've been reached out to twice via email by marketing reps from the coffee chain, who have told me the chain ""LOVES"" and ""is a fan of"" my work. These reps have also sent me gifts, including festival tickets, branded merchandise, and gift cards. This confirmed to me that I was safe to continue creating my design and had the chain's approval. However, just a few days ago, I received a cease and desist letter from a law firm representing the chain demanding that I remove all images of the Masshole Lobster from my social media and stop selling them altogether. They allege I'm infringing on an unused (yet still trademarked) logo from 2019 (before their big rebrand) and also tarnishing the brand by pairing the logo with the cigarette in my design (lol...). I'm in the process of attempting to consult a local small business lawyer to get advice before the deadline they gave me (end of next week), but I would appreciate any and all advice I can get. I'm wondering if my design could be protected under Fair Use?

1. She wants a tip for making a drink but doesn't think a barista should get one for also making a drink? Pouring a beer isn't harder than pouring a coffee. A cocktail isn't harder than a speciality coffee with a bunch of customizations. Honestly it seems like she thinks she's better than them bc she works in a NYC bar and if that's true that's gross 

2. She wants people to pay cash so she doesn't have to pay tax on a huge chunk of her income. Why do other participants in society have to pay tax and then tip on their after-tax income, but she thinks they have to go out of their way to get cash so she can essentially lie to the IRS? No one wants to pay taxes but no one needs to care about your tax evasion strategy, girl 

3. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to run a tab or not carrying cash. And I don't live in the USA so forcing a 2 drink minimum is ridiculous to me but the fact that she talks about all this with that snooty accent she puts on made this conversation over the top annoying

Can I get fired if I report it?","I’m a 25-year-old male who started working at Starbucks in September In Canada. Early on, I noticed my store manager was using Grindr, so I created a fake profile to connect with him because I have a kink for older men in positions of authority. My manager is gay and in an open relationship.

Although I initially used a fake account, he always knew it was me because I sent explicit videos from the store’s bathroom, clearly identifiable as our workplace. He consistently pretended not to recognize me online. Initially, I only wanted to exchange explicit content and had no intention of meeting up physically. However, around late February and early March, my manager began making explicit advances towards me during shifts.

These included:
	1.	Slowly pouring a “pup cup” into a cup I was holding while staring directly into my eyes suggestively.
	2.	Making a suggestive joke about the size of a grilled cheese sandwich, implying he knew mine was “big.”
	3.	Intently staring at my lips and suggestively saying, “You should just do it,” when discussing my work schedule.
	4.	Responding flirtatiously when I casually asked about his weekend plans, telling me, “Why don’t you tell me what my plans will look like.”

All these interactions happened over approximately five days while he simultaneously made persistent requests to meet via Grindr. Eventually, we had sex once in March.

During this period, I was also experiencing domestic violence at home from my ex-partner. After I disclosed this personal issue to my manager, his behavior towards me changed dramatically. He became hostile, severely cut back my working hours, deliberately scheduled me away from shifts with him, and began treating me poorly in general.

Despite his harsh behavior at work, he occasionally resumed flirting or giving sexual hints whenever he sensed I was pulling away emotionally. For instance, during our last shift together on June 6, when I completely ignored his attempts to provoke a reaction, he made several inappropriate sexual gestures:
	1.	He bent over near me, commenting on his flexibility, knowing this previously excited me.
	2.	He stood next to me and softly said, “Are you guys hungry? I’m very hungry,” ensuring others couldn’t overhear.
	3.	While handing him a coffee cup, he placed the sticker on my hand and suggestively rubbed it up and down before quickly withdrawing after realizing his actions.
	4.	He intentionally touched my back slowly with his arm while I was restocking shelves.

I have screenshots and recordings of our Grindr conversations and suggestive emoji interactions, documenting his behavior. However, I’m concerned because initially, most Grindr interactions were initiated by me. And I recorded myself and took pictures of my p***s in the stores bathroom, and I know that’s considered a severe violation of Starbucks conduct policy since is within work hours and is endangering a workplace environment. He only did it once but he did it. He sent me a picture with mouth fully open and tongue out for me to jerk of and cum on it. And he took it in between meetings sitting down in his desk. I did mines exclusively within breaks. Nevertheless, all inappropriate workplace interactions were exclusively initiated by him, in front and without partners present, sexual jokes or mean behaviors.


My primary concern is if reporting this to HR could potentially lead to my termination. I want him to face accountability because his manipulative behavior significantly harmed my mental health, causing prolonged emotional distress. He repeatedly pushed boundaries to satisfy his ego and validation needs, despite clearly seeing the negative impact it had on me while he knew how extremely sensitive I am. Altough I initiated around 90% of the interactions on Grindr he was the only one bringing it to the workplace.
Please I need your help guys. I can’t keep dealing with his emotional abuse, I stopped already but there’s not a single day in where I don’t cry about going to my own store because very one thinks he’s amazing but he’s a bitch towards me.",0,1749746754.0,starbucksbaristas,21,0.29,False

Because i had been ticking a lot moments before and suddnely they calmed down when i was staring into the ceiling.

I kept doing it and it stopped almost fully, if not completely. I tried this the next day and today and its still works. It may be bit more difficult if you drank coffee or just worked out. But it still works.

Anyways, can someone else try this and report back? Just stare at one spot either eyes open or closed and see if they calm down. For me, this is great because i can meditate much longer without tweaking.

If i start moving my eyes again it comes back, so i assume that eye movement is connected to the basal ganglia or whatever. Anyways lmk if it works for you.",0,1749746596.0,Tourettes,1,0.5,False

Started with 10mg for a week, nothing. Increased it to 20mg the next week, still nothing. She wrote me a script for 30mg and i'm 3 weeks in and Im convinced they are sugar pills lol.

When I was on adderall, I was at least awake if that makes sense, I just couldn't stay focused. I felt awake and alert, no brain fog, I could get up and do. I would do and do and do but I was all over the place because nothing was really ""getting fully accomplished"" so that why she switched me. 

Long story short I was at my brothers house with his family and my family, lots of stimulation and I could not stay awake and struggled.  My brother made a comment about if I took my vyvance why was I not wanting to get up and  go and do and why was I so tired. 

Then again yesterday I got up, took my medicine and went to my PT appointment and was dragging. 4 hours passed and I finally got some coffee because I was ready to just crawl back in bed. 

I take it the same time every morning and I sleep pretty consistant at night. I mentioned it to my doctor and now she wants to take me off of it and try modafinil.

  
Does anyone have any insight or thoughts ? Whats your experience been like on Vyvance? How do you know its kicked in and working? I just have no idea how im supposed to know if its working and based off of how alert I was when on Adderall thats the only thing I can compare it to that makes me think its not because she made it seem like I would be alert and be able to focus.",2,1749746586.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False

I sincerely think that orthorexia should be classified as a subcategory of anorexia the next time a DSM is published, because even though I'm physically eating more now, it's really just volume eating with nothing but raw fruits and veggies - same restrictive caloric intake as before more or less. This fucking sucks because I'm so goddamn constipated to the point it feels like I'm 9 months pregnant with a poop baby that will not. fucking. **move**. 

I'm so fucking scared of dairy and protein and I am *verrrrryyyy* picky about what carbs enter my body. I'm studying for 2 healthcare degrees right now so I'm constantly around talk of interactions between food and different body systems, and my delusional ass likes to blow these facts way out proportion and use them as justification to restrict.

I just don't get it. I'm in a new place. I'm safe now. I thought I would be able to stop but there's a sick part of me that doesn't want to let go. I'm even lonelier than before and it never really clicked until recently how people can feel like eating disorders are actual little friends. 

I fucked up my body so bad with laxatives over the past 8 years, I'm afraid I became dependent now. I bought some kefir yesterday and I'm making it a morning ritual to drink a glass because maybe there's an imbalance of bacteria in my gut causing constipation? It feels like nothing is moving though. I also for some stupid goddamn reason cut out all caffeine, which in theory should be good bc I was WAY over the daily recommended intake, but without coffee, there's actually nothing happening.

The fourth thing I added was the kettle. I thought the gooseneck was going to help me more with pour overs, but I have not noticed the difference yet. At least having a better temperature control helps me to control some variables for my brews🤓.

I haven't been angry for a long time, until recently.

An SSRI I'm on has slowly built up anger and frustration in me that I haven't felt since I was a teen. I don't let it out, I suppress it, and it builds up in my chest. I don't feel anxiety, I don't feel sad (although very unmotivated and fatigued), I just feel this intense pressure in my chest and extreme internal frustration with every customer at work. Extreme, internalized.

It's because they're all wealthy and able to drop hundreds to thousands on stupid fucking plants. I love plants too, dude. But I can barely afford to eat. 

I'm angry at the American dictatorship and I'm angry at how blind Republicans are. 

I'm angry. I'm so angry. I'm fuming. I'm burning alive on the inside. I feel like I could combust any day, now. 

Working out doesn't help. I just want to scream and thrash around but it's feels like it'd be for nothing because I'll just continue to be angry at this stupid fucking society. 

IF YOU CANT FUCKING READ THE FIVE EXIT SIGNS, WHY ARE YOU ALLOWED TO VOTE? 

It feels egotistical to think everyone's stupid and that I know better. It is egotistical. I'm not manic, though. I'm not. Otherwise my house wouldn't be filthy and I'd be showered and my teeth would be brushed and I'd have made breakfast and coffee this morning. I'm not manic. I'm angry and egotistical but this is not mania. 

People are getting stomped on by horses and shot with a non-lethal just trying to get home to their apartment, meanwhile I'm stuck at this dead end job and forced to smile at every stupid customer and gently help them get through a simple ass check-out.

Read the sign that says ""tap here."" No, your coupons are not redeemable yet. This coupon is expired. Of course, I'll put this plant up for you because you didn't check the price before getting it. Just follow that arrow right there on that exit sign. No, I don't know why management turned off redemptions for your rewards points, because they won't tell me and it's been months. Here, let me take care of that for you. I'm happy to help. Big smile, guys. Big smile and stay professional. Welcome to our store! We're so happy to have you here! Oh, I didn't know that item was on sale because no one told us cashiers, even though it's our job to ring you up and apply sales. I love my job! Tehe!

I feel crazy. I feel so fucking crazy. Why is everyone acting so normal and unaffected when our world is dying and fascists are taking over and we continue to be the gum on the rich and powerful's shoes. Why can't I fucking afford to eat? I just want to afford groceries. I just want to afford rent. I just want a reliable car. I just want a vacation that I can afford. I didn't ask for this. I'm a hard worker. I've done everything I can and I don't even have a fucking family to rely on. I'm so over it. I'm so done. I'm so fucking done. 

This isn't sadness. This is pure anger. I wish I could be a robot like everyone else. I wish I could just be happy. I just want to be happy. ",10,1749746554.0,bipolar,8,1.0,False
1l9r8er,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1l9r8er/earfun_tune_pro_review_great_budget_reccomendaiton/,Earfun Tune pro review (Great budget reccomendaiton),"

Here’s my review of the Earfun Tune Pro headphones, which you can currently grab for $52 on Amazon with coupons. In short, these punch way above their weight class and hold their own against headphones in the $100–$150 range. They are a perfect comparison to Soundcore Q20i/Q30 with levels of quality, features, and performance. I still have the Q20i, so I’ll be comparing them side-by-side throughout this review.

# 🔧 Look & Build Quality

The design is basic— no flashy flair or color options like Soundcore offers. You get a gray/silver cup with a black frame. Definitely easy to overlook if you're drawn to style, but I guess thatit keeps the cost down. Like I said in my Earfun Air Pro 4 review,their design and build give off a “Sleeper PC” vibe, plain outside, but strong internals.

The build feels solid. They’re lightweight without feeling cheap, and the foldable earcups rotate in for easy storage, perfect to toss in a bag or coat pocket.

Button layout is standard. If you’ve used any headphones in the last few years, you’ll know exactly what to do. They don't have a wear sensor like the earbuds do, so that is interesting to leave off.

**Overall: 7.5/10 for Look & Build**

\-----------------------------

# Fit & Comfort

I’ve got a big head and some manly-sized ears, but these still fit really well. The earcups are large enough to cover my ears fully with no pinching, and they stayed comfy after several 40-minute walks in warm weather—no sweaty ears!

The clamp pressure is just right, secure without being too tight, and no bouncing when walking.

**Overall: 9/10 for Fit & Comfort**

\----------------------------------------

# 🔗 Connection

This part really surprised me. I had minor pairing issues with my Earfun Air Pro 4s, but the Tune Pro with Bluetooth 5.4 has been seamless. As soon as I turn them on, they connect instantly, no delays.

No connection drops either. I can walk all over my condo while my phone is on the other side with no stutters.

They don't have Google Fast Pair, but the setup was easy on my S24 Ultra and Galaxy Tab.

**Overall: 10/10 for Connection**

\-----------------------------------------

# 🎵 Sound Quality & EQ

Now to the good stuff—sound. Out of the box, they’re just *okay*, a little light on bass. But after EQ tweaking, they really come to life. I tested with my normal tracks for all new headphones:

* Kendrick Lamar – *M.A.A.D City*
* Justin Timberlake – *What Goes Around*
* Dave Brubeck – *Take Five* (random I know)

After tuning, the bass comes through clean and strong, and they handle sub-rumble well, but I did want just a *bit more*. They’re louder than the Q20i and stay clear at max volume with no distortion. Mids and highs? Crisp.

One thing to note: bass drops in transparency mode, but it’s back in Normal and ANC modes. Between these and the Q20i, I’d give the edge to the Tune Pro for fuller sound, but barely.

**Overall: 7.5/10 for Sound**

\-----------------------------------------

# 🔇 ANC & Transparency

I know these are the co-stars next to sound quality when it comes to headphones, so here it is. ANC is solid for the price—not elite, but way better than expected. I tested with my 500W surround system playing café and airplane sounds on YouTube (my go-to test). They blocked out most low-end noise, like engine hum, but high-pitched sounds (voices, cups) still come through, and it has that underwater sound to it.

With music on, you’re in your own world—I got startled by a bus while walking as I was too close to the street and didn't hear/sense it coming. 

For reference, the absolute best ANC I have experienced was on the Hauweai Free Buds Pro 4 (I'd rate that a 10/10), but the price reflected that.

Transparency mode sounds artificial, like audio piped through a speaker (which I know this is), but it works. I could hear cars coming from behind me, dog chains clinking, leaves, and footsteps of other people while walking.

Compared to AirPods or Bose? Not close. But for $50? It’s very respectable.

**Overall: 8/10 for ANC & Transparency**

\-------------------------------------------

# 🎙️ Mic Quality

Another area that is important to me for headphones is Mic quality as I am frequently on the phone and on Zoom meetings, especially while traveling for work and meeting in coffee shops or in the car and on he go. Mic performance is pretty solid in quiet or moderate environments, like at home, walking outside, or in the car. My girlfriend said she could hear birds chirping and passing cars while we talked, so it picks up background detail.

In noisy environments, though, the mics struggle. I tested with café noise playing in the background and left myself voicemails, the voice gets muffled, and the AI suppression just can’t keep up. Same story with the Q20i though, so not a surprise at this price.

Great for calls at home or light background noise. Just not built for busy nosiy environments.

**Overall: 7/10 for Mic Quality**

\------------------------------

# 💬 Final Thoughts

If you're looking for budget travel headphones, or just a solid pair of over-ears to have around, the Earfun Tune Pro is a no-brainer at this price. It holds its own against more expensive headphones and is a direct comparison to Soundcore's Q20i and Q30.I just wish they offered more color options, but for $50, you’re getting flagship-level value.

I just visited this location last weekend and I must say what a wonderful experience it was!  First and foremost- I’d like to say that they have such a friendly staff. They are efficient, helpful, kind and most importantly remember me when I walk in the door.  This is my go to place any time I stay in Fresno.

We were immediately upgraded to the top floor, thanked for returning, and amenities were explained in case we had forgotten.  Yes- this is Fresno so don’t expect a 4 star + experience.  As a 3 star hotel it does the trick.  I appreciated the nighttime security of the parking lot. 

Our room was immaculately cleaned and the room fridge was very cold. Air conditioning was already turned on when we walked in which was very nice.  The room was quiet and perfect for sleeping. The indoor pool was perfect for swimming- which we enjoy year round even in the height of winter.

When we arrived for breakfast, mostly everything was gone due to a rush but the attendant assured us everything was being made.  Within 5 minutes we had fresh eggs, bacon, hash-browns and more. It was so delicious!  The iced coffee I had at the bar was made to keto perfection.

One thing to note: bass drops in transparency mode, but it’s back in Normal and ANC modes. Between these and the Q20i, I’d give the edge to the Tune Pro for fuller sound, but barely.

**Overall: 7/10 for Sound**

\-----------------------------------------

# 🔇 ANC & Transparency

I know these are the co-stars next to sound quality when it comes to headphones, so here it is. ANC is solid for the price—not elite, but way better than expected. I tested with my 500W surround system playing café and airplane sounds on YouTube (my go-to test). They blocked out most low-end noise, like engine hum, but high-pitched sounds (voices, cups) still come through, and it has that underwater sound to it.

With music on, you’re in your own world—I got startled by a bus while walking as I was too close to the street and didn't hear/sense it coming. 

For reference, the absolute best ANC I have experienced was on the Hauweai Free Buds Pro 4 (I'd rate that a 10/10), but the price reflected that.

Transparency mode sounds artificial, like audio piped through a speaker (which I know this is), but it works. I could hear cars coming from behind me, dog chains clinking, leaves, and footsteps of other people while walking.

Compared to AirPods or Bose? Not close. But for $50? It’s very respectable.

**Overall: 8/10 for ANC & Transparency**

\-------------------------------------------

# 🎙️ Mic Quality

Another area that is important to me for headphones is Mic quality as I am frequently on the phone and on Zoom meetings, especially while traveling for work and meeting in coffee shops or in the car and on he go. Mic performance is pretty solid in quiet or moderate environments, like at home, walking outside, or in the car. My girlfriend said she could hear birds chirping and passing cars while we talked, so it picks up background detail.

In noisy environments, though, the mics struggle. I tested with café noise playing in the background and left myself a series of voicemails, the voice gets muffled, and the AI suppression just can’t keep up. Same story with the Q20i though, so not a surprise at this price.

Great for calls at home or light background noise. Just not built for busy nosiy environments.

**Overall: 7/10 for Mic Quality**

\------------------------------

# 💬 Final Thoughts

If you're looking for budget travel headphones, or just a solid pair of over-ears to have around, the Earfun Tune Pro is a no-brainer at this price. It holds its own against more expensive headphones and is a direct comparison to Soundcore's Q20i and Q30.I just wish they offered more color options, but for $50, you’re getting flagship-level value.

So I seem to need meds every 6 months. We are currently battlingy insurance (of course). This has been going on for 2 1/2 weeks. Meanwhile I'm getting worse and it really doesn't seem like what I eat makes a difference :( I eat small portions, well cooked veggies or prepared fruit (like microwaving apple slices so they're soft), avoid skins and seeds, focus on soluble fiber and protein (I have life long constipation issues due to a birth defect). If I eat broccoli, it's well steamed baby broccoli. I also don't tolerate fats well so my diet is very low fat. 

Prior to IMO (actually prior to my gallbladder removal a couple years ago) I struggled to burp. Now I'm in a bad phase it seems almost constant cuz I'll still burp 2 hr after eating. The burps are a very low pitch -  lower than I can speak or sing. They are loud. I've tried closed mouth, open mouth, napkin. Has anyone found a good way to muffle the sound??? 

 I've been able to leave a restaurant to go outside to burp but that's not always doable. If I don't burp my chronic nausea kicks in and I can't eat. We are going to the ocean on a couple weeks and will be spending hours away from our hotel room. 

Sometimes the gas itself will trigger dry heaving to get the gas out, so I can't suppress the gas). It is worst in the morning. I have to eat with some of my meds so I eat 1/2 c of oatmeal or hot wheat cereal or a piece of toast. I also drunk 2 cups of coffee. Larely I've been throwing up almost every am.

1l9r0bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1l9r0bx/worlds_across_working_conditions_conversation/,Worlds Across Working Conditions - Conversation with Owner,"Hi all,

I know this isn’t a Worlds Across sub, but there have been a lot of posts recently and I know that many of us utilize or are considering utilizing the platform. No need to keep reading if that does not apply to you.

I have never shared a referral link here or with anyone else. I have recommended WA in the past because I think that it is the best platform to learn Spanish for DSers, with (almost) all of the tutors open to working with a CI approach. 

Obviously, I was concerned by recent comments from students and tutors and raised these concerns with Osmel, one of the owners. I spoke with several current and former tutors prior to make sure I was emphasizing their actual concerns. We spoke for about an hour and I summarize our conversation below.

*Tone*

The conversation started with a monologue on the economic realities of Latin America, creating opportunities for groups of people (like SAHMs) to work from home, no one being forced to work there, etc. I am a labor lawyer and hear these arguments from employers all the time, so I was frankly disappointed at the beginning. 

Afterwards, though, we had a thorough discussion of the details of the company’s finances, compensation structure, working conditions, etc., and I came away feeling that they are genuinely trying to make things better.

*Salaries*

Osmel told me, and this tracks with my conversations with former tutors, that the salary question is mostly an issue in Argentina, where prices have exploded in the last two years. This is also presumably why there are no tutors in the Caribbean, where both costs and salaries are higher (a problem familiar to us as DS users).

The salary structure that a former tutor posted here is correct. Around 70% of tutors receive monthly bonuses, with the majority of those who don’t being newer tutors who are scheduled less often for obvious reasons. 

The platform takes the view that they should reward tutors who form connections with students and perform their jobs well; he raised an idea of allowing students to pick their favorite tutors, with whom they would have earlier scheduling access, and who would receive a greater portion of that student’s monthly fee. 

I expressed some concerns over giving students even more power over tutors in that way, but it seems like we just have a philosophical disagreement there—it is the case that if students don’t like their tutors and leave the platform, the platform will cease to exist. I obviously have tutors that I schedule more than others and I understand the desire to reward that, even if I have concerns about the incentive structure that that creates. 

Based on the data he showed me, the company is basically putting all of its resources into salaries/overhead and there is no obvious way to increase salaries without raising prices.

I told him that myself, along with at least some other students who have posted here, would be willing to pay more every month for the knowledge that the tutors we work with are making a decent living. He appreciated that, but I did not get the sense that he wanted to move in that direction. Again, it just is the case that if I’m wrong about that, and they raise prices and students leave, it will be worse for everyone, so I understand the apprehension.

I had wrongly understood that students were prohibited from giving any kind of gifts/gratuities to tutors, which apparently isn’t the case. So I asked whether they had thought about promoting that.

*Tipping*

The platform had already considered adding a “tip” button at the end of their classes—basically every student they asked about it thought it was a bad idea, and I tend to agree. We’re all tired of being prompted to tip after literally every transaction and the addition of a button would create the appearance of an expectation in most people (at least in the U.S.). Still, it was good to see that they had already been workshopping ideas to improve tutor compensation prior to these recent posts.

Personally, I auto-tip 20% on the iPad when I order a coffee or a muffin or do anything else, and thinking about how much less value I get from those transactions than from my Spanish tutors, I am going to start to try to give my frequent tutors something extra every now and then now that I know that there are no rules against it. 

*Free Time*

This is the area I was most insistent on and the area where I think the platform is most likely to make a near-term change. Every current and former tutor I have discussed this with would like to have two free days per week instead of one. Osmel was very receptive to that, said he had heard it from tutors recently, too, and while he did not make any promises, I expect that that change will be made in the coming months. 

*Conclusion*

Two things are true here: 1) despite everything raised above, it does seem to be the case that WA is a significantly better place to work than their competitors (talk to anyone from Baselang, look at the iTalki sub, etc.); and 2) that doesn’t mean that things can’t be better, and it has been genuinely encouraging to me to both to see so many students express concerns in this sub and that those concerns are being taken seriously by the platform. 

If you’re wondering “why is this random guy investing so much time and energy in something that has nothing to do with him,” it is genuinely because I have gained so much from WA and its tutors and feel like I owe it to them. WA is second only to DS in terms of the impact it’s had on my life in the last year. I encourage all of you to try it out and to continue to advocate for more just economic outcomes for the people we learn so much from.",33,1749746030.0,dreamingspanish,19,0.89,False

I wasn't trying to break the rules. This took me forever so I hope it's okay now and can help!**

Hi all, I know there is a lot of anxiety regarding flying right now I want to share some of my tips, tricks, and words of wisdom as someone who flies a lot, but also struggles with flight anxiety. 

**Qualifications**: Frequent(ish) flyer, 2-3 domestic flights a month. 1-3 international flights a year. Fly enough to be good friends with the airport bartender. Enjoy learning about and watching planes despite anxiety.

**Ways in which I'm NOT qualified** and cannot provide professional advice (please listen to the pros): I am NOT a member of your medical team. I am NOT an aviation professional. Everything I'm providing is based on my experience as a fairly frequent flyer.

**Tips and Tricks**

* If your fear is keeping you from living your life the way you want and is causing you significant distress: **TALK TO YOUR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER**. Oh my gosh, please just talk to your doc!!!! I do not see this recommended enough on this thread. Unfortunately, a fear of flying is very common, and it's easy to understand how your body could react in such a way. Flying is not a native feeling to the human body. It's an incredible feat of engineering and technology, but for many, especially those who don't fly regularly, the feelings just don't register in your body in a way that makes sense. If you're like me, you may have obsessively learned about flying safety, and inherently *know* it's safe, but it's hard to convince your body of that sometimes. Please, I'm begging you, talk to a medical professional. They may work with you on starting some sort of plan of care that's right for you. 
* **CHILL OUT WITH THE STARBUCKS BEFORE A FLIGHT.** Seriously. I never understood this. It makes no sense to me to spend $10 on a cup of go go juice before the fight that's going to make you fidgety, potentially need to go number 2, and give ya bad breath. You're not flying the plane! What do you need to be alert for? Even when I do travel for work- I just have coffee when I land.
* **Find a good keep-your-hands-busy kind of hobby.** I see a lot of recommendations for reading a good book, good movies etc. For me, this isn't the best solution. Anytime there is a bump I'd just pause or stop reading and look around, freaked. For me, it helps to have something to do with the nervous energy in my body- so I took up crocheting and it' a game changer.
* **Find the exhausted business traveler and see how not freaked out by anything they are.** I've seen many people say watching the flight attendants be bored in the jump seat helps them relax. Unfortunately, depending on where you're sitting, you might not be able to see them. Next best thing? A business traveler. A lot of these folks are clocking multiple flights a week. From a passenger standpoint, they've seen it all: storms, turbulence, diversions, maintenance delays, cancellations, aborted takeoffs (aviation folks, please correct me if any of this terminology is wrong). Usually, they will have on some sort of business casual or business attire. They won't put away their computer or laptop keyboard until the last possible second before they have to. They won't have on neck pillows or sweat pants or pajamas\*.  If they have carry-ons, they will be very put together and organized. They will get their roller board into the overhead bin so fast it's not funny. Common drink of choice is a G and T or a whiskey. During the flight they will likely be working or will fall asleep almost instantly. They will always look completely nonchalant on the flight- and with good reason- because it's SAFE.
   * Another way you can figure out frequent flyers is to watch their boarding group. The earlier groups are usually premium cabins or higher status, which is usually a good indicator.
   * Sometimes you can also find commuting pilots/cabin crew or members of the millitary in uniform. For the flight team members, in my personal experience, these flights are usually early morning- but that is purely anecdotal. These folks are also going to be incredibly chill and help you remember that you're perfectly safe.
   * \*Not necessarily the case for business travelers in business class on long-haul flights
* **Place something cold on your neck.** If you are in active freakout mode, I recommend this. It won't completely rid you of everything, but can help chill out a bit (literally and figuratively).
* **If it's within your means, consider a premium flying experience.** Obviously, this is very privileged and not always obtainable. If you have the financial means to do so, upgrading to first class can help you feel better. For me, I find having more room helps me feel more relaxed. You don't feel the bumps as significantly toward the front of the plane. The cabin experience is a bit more relaxed in general. A little cocktail in the sky is nice (please exercise caution with this part). If you have already booked, a good rule of thumb for an upgrade offer is that $50 or less per of flight time for an upgrade is a good deal. If you have lounge access, it's much less overwhelming from the start if you have a quiet area to relax before your flight. Boarding a little early is nice. Heck, even if you can check your bag so you don't have to deal with it, that helps reduce some stress. Again, this isn't approachable for everyone, and I understand that, but I'm speaking from my personal experience.
   * Even if you're not buying a premium ticket or an upgrade, there are sites where you can find reviews of seats based on the plane and your airline's configuration, which can help you pick a seat that will be more comfortable for you.
* **Become fascinated with planes.** This may be harder and even counterintuitive but I swear, it's one of the things that's helped me the most. Literally- just learn about planes. Become so fascinated to the point where your friends start to think it's weird that you can spot an A380  in the sky by it's engines and shape. Some airlines have like trading cards you can get when boarding if you ask, and that's fun. Watch the planes take off and land at the airport- there are so many and it's SO cool! Watch an airshow and see how incredible these machines and pilots are. Note- you're probably not going to be getting on a fighter jet with the Blue Angels for your flight, but I swear becoming really into planes has done wonders for my anxiety.
* **For the love of Pete- get up and go pee!** Let me preface this part with- ONLY do this when the pilots have indicated it's safe to get up from your seat. The safest place for you to be in a flight is always in your seat with your seatbelt. However, if you are already feeling anxious- holding it in and white knuckling the seat isn't going to help. Holding it in can make your blood pressure increase some, and overall make you feel more anxious. Also speaking from personal experience, the walk to the bathroom is somehow the most relaxing part of the flight for me. Please don't abuse this, but seriously- if you need to pee, just get up and go. 
* **Wear layers.** The temperature of a plane can vary, and let's be real- those little fan nozzles do next to nothing. Personally, being hot can worsen anxiety. Being super cold can make me feel more jittery. Wear layers so you can adjust accordingly.
* **Stick your hand out of the car window when driving down the road.** The ""jello"" thing didn't work well for me- probably cause I can't submerge myself in a vat of jello to know what it's like. I saw someone recommend sticking your hand out of a car window and running it along the air as your driving, and this somewhat like how the plane lifts into the air (Please don't come for me aviation pros- I'm sure this isn't a 1 to 1 translation here, it's for comfort).
* **Noise-cancelling headphones.** This gets passed around a lot, but the difference between regular headphones and noise-cancelling is insane. You don't realize how overstimulating plane noises can be until you try it.
* **Tell the flight attendants as you board.** I've frequently told the flight attendants as I'm getting on the plane that ""Hi I'm a bit of a nervous flyer. I know we are perfectly safe, but if you see me like staring at you in the mid-flight- I promise I'm not being weird, just a little freaked out."" 9 times out of 10 they are very understanding and will check on me a bit extra. I've even had some spend time with me talking during the flight.
* **This one is gonna seem odd- but hear me out- I often prefer slightly older or smaller planes.** Some of the older planes have better leg room, which is a nice perk. And I think of it like ol' faithful. This is absolutely NO shade to bigger, newer planes- but I see lots of people freaking out about older plane or getting on one of the smaller planes- and as someone who flies a lot I **LOVE** these and think you can learn to love them as well. If I'm not in first class- my FAVE plane for domestic flights is AA's ERJ 145 <3 love my lil bb
* **Fly early morning or late at night.** Not always feasible, but this is usually a more pleasant flying experience. Slightly less turbulence. Early morning is less likely for delays (not always the case).
* **Breathing exercises.** Enough said.
* **Eat something before, but don't overindulge.** It's good to have something on your stomach, and will help you feel more comfortable. But please, practice caution when visiting the food court Panda Express. You don't want to eat so much that you feel ill. 
* **Don't freak out about delays, maintenance, etc.** Delays can be due to many things. It doesn't mean the flight isn't safe or there's something wrong with the flight. I'll let the aviation folks be the true advisors here- but the way I think about is that airplane checks are EXHAUSTIVE. I don't know about y'all, but my pre-driving a car check is basically just- ""do I have gas? No lights on the dash? Seatbelt? Cool."" And tbh I don't even do that every time. The plane pros are checking comprehensive lists, weather, times, traffic, and the list goes on and on and on. The list are so extensive to ensure flying is safe. Maintenance or delays can come up because they are being so freaking critical of every detail just to ensure it's safe for everyone. They're not taking you up in a plane until they are certain everything is safe to do so. Your airline crew wants to get home safe too. As a side note- delays can happen for something as simple as airport traffic to, among a million other things.

I will try to add some more tips as I remember them, but I hope this helps. I also want to reiterate that flying is the safest mode of transportation. Have you ever been at your job and been like ""I have no idea what's happening and I'm just faking it until I make it""? I have! You know who *DOESN'T* feel that way? Commercial Pilots. A buddy of mine is a commercial pilot and has confirmed that. Asked him if he ever gets nervous when flying at work- never. Now, can he confidently talk to a pretty woman and get her number? Not really. Send a giant metal tube through the air at hundreds of miles per hour? With ease.

I hope this helps at least one person :) It took me a while but I wiill add more tips in the comments as I remember with them. I've got a flight next week so will try to remember to index them!

Those are absolutely horrible strong smells my body emits.

Today I was standing in the kitchen,  when I suddenly sensed strong odor, I started to turn around trying to point out where it is coming from but could not detect the source. I live alone, there was nobody else around me. 
I started to sniff sink drain, but no the pipes were fine. The awful odor was coming from me and it is connected with digestive system. 

When I was moving I also sensed a whiff of the same odor, so it's definitely me. 
 

I am trying to eat clean but the only thing that could trigger the smell is coffee( I drink just plain coffee without sugar or milk) or balsamic salad dressing.

I am a coffee addict so I don't know how to give that up. 

Also I have troubles with bad breath and acv is helping me with that because it stops post nasal drip that I am also struggling with. 

I have no possibility to test for tmau, so I want to ask you what could be the root cause of this. 

I think my smell varies, sometimes it's dead decomposing animal, sewage, garbage, sometimes is sweet/musty odor... the odor of something moldy/wet cloth...it's definitely related to intestinal bacteria.

A few days ago I went to my GP (in UK) about chronic fatigue that I've had since I was a child, I have been to the GP countless times about this over the years and they always dismissed it as depression, anemia, hypothyroidism etc. but this time the GP has actually taken it seriously,as I informed her that the only way I can stay awake is by drinking 4 monster energies and 4-6 coffees every day, and is referring me to the chronic fatigue clinic to be assessed for fibromyalgia. I have always been aware of this condition and the pain associated but it wasn't until it was suggested that I might have it that I'm realising that I actually have aches and pains all over, like my wrists, elbows, knees, neck etc. that I just kind of got used to and blanked out because I've had them for so long and put them down to my weight as I am overweight, is it normal to not really notice the pain until it's suggested to you or could my pains just get psychosomatic? I am aware that symptoms can be exacerbate by stress and I'm definitely stressed about potentially having this diagnosis so maybe that could be why I'm feeling these pains now because my fatigue has definitely gotten worse since speaking to my GP",1,1749745824.0,Fibromyalgia,0,1.0,False

Some things that really help:





	•	🧺 Finishing laundry — not just washing, but folding and putting it away within the hour. It instantly motivates me to tackle other chores. When it’s done, it feels like proof that I can keep up with life.

	•	🧼 Deep cleaning with intention — like wiping down baseboards and corners with a hot cloth before I mop. I don’t always have the energy, but when I do it, I’m so thankful later. My floors stay clean longer, and it just feels better walking barefoot or letting the kids crawl and play.

	•	🥗 Meal planning — sitting down to plan the week’s meals, grocery shopping with a list (instead of vibes), and prepping even one or two things ahead of time makes the whole week less overwhelming.

	•	👚 Outfit planning — when I lay out clothes for the week, even loosely, it saves me so much mental energy in the mornings. I feel more put-together and less stressed.

	•	🛏️ Making the bed — it takes 30 seconds but somehow makes the whole room (and my brain) feel less chaotic.

	•	📝 Writing quick to-do lists the night before — especially if I keep it super simple and realistic. Even 2–3 tasks. Waking up and knowing what’s next makes it easier to get moving.

	•	🧃 Filling my water bottle and prepping coffee the night before — it’s such a small thing but it lowers friction in the morning and sets me up to start the day with a win.

These aren’t huge, life-changing things. But doing them consistently makes me feel like I’m taking care of myself in a way that builds real momentum. I think for those of us with ADHD (or just busy mom brains), that kind of forward-feeding motivation is everything.",8,1749745737.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1l9qv12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l9qv12/please_give_me_some_advice_this_will_be_a_long/,Please give me some advice.. this will be a long post.,"So I’m recently going through a break up, that happened about a month and two weeks ago. (On my birthday month too) 
And let me start by saying I met this girl June of last year when she decided to message me after following me on social media for about a month.. we quickly started chatting and she told me she’s very shy and nervous and doesn’t usually slide Into DMs..  (we have mutuals family friends etc and she lives very close to me.. literally 10 minutes) now at the start everything was magic. We went on a couple dates and I was Insanely attracted to her.. I even waited to be Intimate with her because I usually would have hook ups and been with quite a bit of women and I wanted to treat her differently (no bragging at ALL just truthfully saying I’m a decent looking guy) after we figured out how sexually compatible we were and It was amazing.. soon problems started happening… she would always shut down when she had problems or when we needed to discuss things.. I’m not a saint but I’m always accessing problems with the mindset of “let’s show up and be here” and she didn’t like that.. and also her past relationships were very strange. She had a very abusive ex as her first boyfriend (badly abusive) her second was someone she saw once a week for about 8 months then there was me.. we saw one another 2-4 times a week, she would stay the night at my house on the weekends (which by the way she says she NEVER does that unless she falls asleep at someone’s house she was hooking up with as It requires a lot of trust) I would always buy her flowers, take her out and pay, pay for gas, pump her gas, try to be involved with her life.. go over to her house to hang with her and her mom and dad and her dog on the regular or on holidays (who on the adoption papers in the legal father now) so our relationship to my mind was great? We even went on a beach trip together and all this stuff.. met her close friends at a party.. this Is where things get a bit deeper.. she’s In therapy.. she’s also adopted, on birth control, mood stabilizers, and another type of people for her body heat.. we started having problems because I posted her a lot on my Instagram showing her off because I have a bigger account.. throughout our entire relationship she only posted me twice which were not even like face and face smiling pictures or kissing pictures like I had.. they were subtle and no one could tell she was In a relationship.. when I confronted her about this multiple times she would say “my toxic ex use to ask me to do that… I use social media for my life” It sort of felt like every other excuse other than “hey I’ll post you If that will make you feel better” and It’s not like It was MAKE OR BREAK seeing as I still stayed In the relationship. But she would also get upset If I wake up In the morning and Instead of Instantly texting her (which I would 90% of the time) I would maybe repost something on my Instagram story which she would make a HUGE deal about which hurt because of the situation I mentioned above. 
The relationship was NOT horrible by any means. There was a bunch of laughs, Intimacy, love.. Immense love. But we’d have disagreements and I would always feel like I had to take the role of both partners emotional consistency or weight.. I would always play the advocate and more so she wouldn’t be able to get over our arguments or disagreements.. she would always hold onto them and listen I’m not saying “hey snap and you’re back to normal” I understand that some people have to get over things on their on own terms but when you are using that as a way to be mean, distant or off put your partner and not communicating then It becomes an even bigger Issue and that’s what ended up happening.. I’m going to give a couple more examples and then explain the break up as this post Is getting already so long and In order
1. She went out with a couple of her girlfriends one time towards the start of our talking phase/relationship (about 3 months In.. when we already both told one another we are only talking to one another exclusively)
It was a soccer game and apparently one of the soccer players came to her and could barely speak English and said he liked her tattoos and took his phone out and said “Instagram” she thought he was talking about the tattoo artist and typed that In but he gave It back and he said yours so she gave him hers and she followed him. Now that next day I had a weird dream and woke up and checked her following and saw that and just said to her “Hey! Did someone try hitting on you that you didn’t tell me about at the soccer game?” She even made a post about workout shoes or some shit too.. she told me yes and then explained the situation to me and I was like “Hey, you know It would have been nice If you told me since It’s a respectful thing to do. Since you have to take how I would feel Into consideration since It was clear he was trying to flirt with you and you basically yes to a degree, did he try reaching out to you after that?” And she said yes he did but she never responded and she deleted the Instagram thread because “out of sight out of mind” that was something I was VERY upset about and honestly should have walked then but I continued like an Idiot.
2. She has told me multiple times she does not keep Into contact with past sexual relations because most of them were one night stands and relationships and If the sex was bad or she didn’t enjoy them or etc she would block them and move on… she had a good friend she hooked up with a couple times throughout a summer 4 years ago but they remained friends and they talked “lightly” (keep this word In mind because It’s Important)
Well.. I found out the history of this “friendship” and he messaged her one time maybe a year or so ago maybe two I don’t know but he had a girlfriend and she wanted an open relationship and he accepted so he messaged my ex asking If she was Interested and she said “I don’t share and It’s not worth our friendship” and she’s told me multiple times she would never hook up with him again and she just enjoys him as a friend but also had told me they have a weird relationship (her words) so she got drunk one night and told me she talks to him about every week…….. I was beyond fucking pissed off because I told her “I thought you said lightly?” She said that Is lightly to her… I felt kind of lied to because that felt like consistently.. If I get Starbucks lightly throughout the month I’d say once or twice a month max.. But If I get Starbucks consistently throughout a month.. then you’d assume once a week. She started trying to problem solve with me but the thing Is she would also consider his feelings which made me even more upset.. basically his decision would decide the next part of our relationship when all I wanted was more clear cut honesty and communication.. because again, I felt lied to or disrespected. And I didn’t even want them to stop talking.. I just wanted her not to say something that clearly wasn’t true In the future. 
Even the fact he knew about me before I knew about him (they are friends so I understand that) but he Invited her to come to his graduation which was two hours away and she never even told me about If, I was being funny at one point and told her “haha ask him If I can come!” 
3. Sex. Sex between us was great.. she always had this type of disconnect towards It (I don’t know how to explain.. she’s the first woman I’ve ever been with that almost felt not present but present If that makes sense?) It’s always been very weird but I assure you that I made sure she was satisfied.. when we first started we would have sex 24/7 (her mood stabilizers that I mentioned she was only just now starting to get on them when we first met) so since they weren’t fully In effect her libido was normal but I slowly started watching It disappear until the month we broke up (end April) and the last time we were Intimate (Mid March) I was starting to get discouraged.. she’s not a very affectionate, nurturing person as Is.. not In a bad way but she rarely Initiates a kiss, or things to that nature.. hugs yeah sure but she’s just not overly affectionate I guess or? Idk how to explain but yeah.
So I was sort of dying for Intimacy (not just sex) but like feeling any type of love, and on my birthday (early April) she planned this entire amazing experience horseback riding and she bought me presents had her mother bake me a cake etc took me out to dinner.. (this was the first time she planned something big for me or even planned something like that)
We get back to my house to lay down and granted a month before I told her all I wanted for my birthday was her on my lap.. we get back to my house and I tell her “hey I hate to even ask this but can we have sex?” She literally froze up and said “If I would have known I wouldn’t have made myself exhausted and all the things I had planned and this and that and I told her that’s okay I just want to make sure we aren’t just becoming friends here and oh my god she then said “I knew this might happen that I might not be able to have sex when I was planning your birthday and ruin It” and she got Into a fetal position on my bed and started crying so heavily and I was so shocked and stunned.. I was voice concerns and talking to her and she broke down and I felt like complete and utter shit so I held her and told her she gave me the best birthday of all time and I just miss her.. (also, everytime I brought the issue up It was never “you won’t give me sex I’m going to leave you and find someone” which I told her so many times.. I’m loyal to the person I love.. It comes from a genuine place of I miss the intimacy of partner and that physical connection) that was about two weeks before we broke up.
4. The note. Man this Is where I wish I would have left.. about 4-5 months In I started noticing more things that were very strange with her.. so I didn’t want to start problems or anything to that nature so I decided to write down how I felt on a note similar to this but with my own thoughts and conclusions and I told her I did and she asked to see It but after I wrote It I felt relieved and started realizing maybe the problems weren’t as bad as I was making them and If I give her the note It might hurt the relationship more than help.. so I moved on from It and continued can you guess what she did the next week?
She came over with a note typed up somehow similar to mine about why we should break up and we both weren’t ready for a relationship but later down the road we would come back to one another.. I told her “okay.. so does that mean no more seeing one another, no more talking?” And she was like “I didn’t really think about that…” ???? Like what In the actual fuck am I supposed to do with someone offering a “solution” with no practical grounds or realistic expectations?? We continued on of course and didn’t break up. She told me I needed therapy too, which was shocking but I was willing to give It a try because I knew I had trust Issues. And that I have an anxious attachment style (found that out recently)
5. The break up. Oh the break up. If you’ve stuck around this long, thank you. Truly. Because this experience has been so damn strange and I don’t even know what to think anymore. If you need to know If I love this girl or not, trust me. I love her with my entire being. I’m not a saint. One time at our beach trip I tried to go through her phone (I have huge trust Issues) and she found out and was upset. I felt like complete and utter shit when I did that. But she told me I needed therapy so I did (this was after the note I mentioned that was about 4-5 months Into our relationship) therapy really helped me.. I never accused of her of anything, I never mistrusted her.. In my eyes I was really liking therapy and It was helping me work through my slight insecurities.. we did have a situation about 7-8 months In where I couldn’t find my phone and I was trying to use the flashlight to find the remote In the bed (and my phone at that point) so I grabbed her phone for the flashlight and found the remote and my phone.. and what do you know the next few days she tells me she was upset that I was using her phone again and she saw me and she was upset I did and I said well If you saw me then you saw the flashlight on the phone? And you’ve told me I could use your phone before… and she was like “It took you about 5 seconds to get the flashlight on while staring at my screen” and It was discouraging because yes I picked up her phone to use the flashlight and the notifications were there and I couldn’t help but read one but I wasn’t picking up her phone with the intention to “snoop” it was just right there. We fixed that issue but It was still hurtful because I knew I was making progress and It came from a genuine place of trying to find the fucking remote and my fucking phone. If I wanted to snoop why would I attempt to do It right In your face and not just take the fucking phone somewhere else away from you? Like It was so fucking hurtful.
I’m going through a tangent. Now the meat and potatoes. The break up.. 
About 2 weeks before the break up we went out and I started feeling like I was just paying for meals and while I love her and I enjoy our time.. the non sex was bothering me.. I wasn’t getting very much affection, she was closed off to even making out because she didn’t want me to feel like sex was even on the table. So while we were eating I told her I felt like we were starting to just coexist.. which she was extremely mad and upset about and was claiming I didn’t understand what she was going through and how she feels. And I had to explain to her that was definitely not the right thing to say and I feel like shit because I just missed her and I was fucking frustrated. And this situation was not just affecting her, It was affecting me too which she acknowledged. I’ll try not to get graphic but we went to see a movie (Sinners.. amazing movie) that she wanted to take me to see (also.. towards the end of the relationship I started SLIGHTLY backing up to give her room to breathe, process, and myself as well since I felt like I was putting a lot of energy and attention and not getting the return I was wanting.. I didn’t want to break up.. I just thought that sometimes couples might go through this and I love, In love with her so much I was backing up just a tiny bit) she was the one who asked me If I wanted to see It and we ended up seeing It (she tells me she doesn’t watch scary movies and never will but she watched 28 days and weeks later with me along with sinners) we went back to her parents house had dinner hang out then we went back to my house to “cuddle” but I was lusting over her so bad I asked her could I you know get off to her without sex and she agreed etc, well next week can you guess what happened? She didn’t like what happened.. even also we got to a solution of her going to her doctor to get pills to get her libido higher or help.. she broke up with me for that and I quote “I’m not ready to talk about It, but we need to talk soon” (I was at work during the busiest time of the year too) and of course I pushed her because of my anxious attachment style and she finally broke and said “I can’t give you what you need and don’t want to feel like shit for providing It.. and I want you to be able to sexually express yourself, this Is not what I want, I love you so very much but It’s what’s best, I feel disconnect from myself , I’m not happy” so I left work on an emergency trying to talk to her face to face and she ran away. Dodging me like I’m the plague which hurt. And we talked on the phone Instead and I asked her “just for boundaries sake.. like are you going to move on with others Is there still hope?” And she was mad I would even ask that? I don’t feel like that’s even fucking fair? 
I finally gave up even though she was on her way to meet me because I was over It. 
Next day? We had each other on Instagram and Facebook still.. she messages me on my Instagram story with a broken heart and we literally talk on Instagram for 3-4 days and she says the most confusing shit ever. “I miss you so much, you don’t know how much I’m hurting right now, I wasn’t even ready to voice the break up and I just blurted It out, I need to work on myself In order to build back from here..” before we Imploded and stopped talking. 
We stayed Into contact for about 3 weeks after the break up… from arguing to not arguing to so much bullshit.
I even got us tickets to see Kendrick and SZA and that was about 10 days after she broke up with me and I still invited her and she said she would have but she’s sick and she’s with her best friend that she had obligations to.. when I was on the phone with her the day of the concert I told her I miss her and this shit sucks and she agreed.. and I was crying and she said something like “do you want to get coffee with me tomorrow?” And I told her I had to go since I was having a breakdown and I knew I wouldn’t go to the concert that I spent hard money on so I brought my good friend who Is a male.. I go to to the concert post so much shit and the entire time my ex Is watching the first person too.. she then posts on her story about how jealous she Is of anyone there tonight at the concert.. I get back home at about 2AM and pass out.. I wake up and see she texted me saying “I know I shouldn’t be bothering you, but did you make It home safe?” I saw the text message but I continued to post on my Instagram story because I was riding high off the concert and I was genuinely feeling good and happy.. and what do you know she unfollows me so I called her and asked why did you do that? And she tells me It’s an accident………….. yeah okay. So I called her out on that and she doubles down and starts taking me off of social media…? We argue for an entire day about how It’s all my fault, and I’m a liar…? Apparently she thought I brought a girl with me I’m pretty sure so I sent her a picture of me and friend (seeing as I didn’t post any pictures of me and my guy friend because I was upset I was there without my girlfriend who Is now ex that I wanted to go with) I finally go to the point where I said listen I’m done with this.. you either come see me at my house and we fix this or you don’t and we’re done. I hate even having to give an ultimatum like that but I was at my limit.. can you guess what happened? She came over we talked and I asked pretty much did she want to be done and she said no, and I asked did she want to be friends and she said no, and I said okay do you want to be partners? And she said yes. We had a long embrace and then she left and we agreed to get coffee at the first place we met. We went to go meet that next weekend and talked a lot and she threw like a piece of bread at me like 3 times and said I was an asshole…? I was hugging on her and we were kissing and things felt okay.. like the road to recovery might happen.. I asked her too that if what I said about coexisting hurt her feelings? And she almost cried on spot and was like holding back her tears.. It was the most saddest thing I’ve seen and I have the mental Image In my head of how she was looking away and lips were open and quivering and her eyes darting with her arms crossed tat that coffee shop table. It hurt me so fucking bad and I know she was hurting so I was just trying to hug her and hold her and try to be there and I apologized too.  We agreed for her to come spend the night next weekend at my house.. we gave hugs and kisses then we both left: we also spoke about how we wouldn’t be texting as much now, which was so upsetting to me and completely sucks. But sure whatever.. well midweek It dawned on me that I don’t think I should let this person come over to my house and stay In my bed just yet. As I was still hurt about the entire situation and us breaking up. Or her dumping me. So I texted her and told her and she was upset. But I made sure to tell her why, and also explain that If we’re laying beside one another I don’t want to start kissing you and making you feel like I need or want sex from you. And I want to be comfortable with you being In my bed again. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to see you which I would love to. But she did not care. She told me “Would It be uncomfortable? Sure. We just broke up. But I was willing to take that step for you to get us back on track because I trust you. I’m so stupid” dude how the fuck am In the wrong? A couple conversations later (on my behalf, calling checking In on her) after she blocks me on Facebook and Instagram but not text. Saying things like “you broke me..?” …? 
“You were my safe space.. you kept pushing me away.” ?
“There’s no bridge left. Your actions through this break up have made It to what feels like there’s no return. You severed those ties.”
And I replied with “so you’re truly done?”
And she says “reread that.. you never care about what time really trying to tell you”
“Even If the bridge can be rebuilt we need time and we need to do this alone.” 
I wish I could type everything but we haven’t spoken since maybe two weeks now. And she exhibits a lot of avoidant attachment style. But like man.. what do I even do? Like Is It really done? Also one thing she said to me which I love Is “you need therapy” *gets therapy* “you’ve changed” well lol……. 
I’ve been strictly not reaching out as much as It hurts and focusing on myself. Gym, therapy, I’ve even been working on this anxious attachment journal that I’m already halfway done with. But any advice would help guys. I feel like I’m the crazy one honestly, maybe I am I don’t even know at this point  ",1,1749745688.0,BreakUps,4,0.99,False

Closest comparison would be to those PS3 games? You remember like Inversion, Binary Domain and Alpha Protocol? Except this game is somehow even more backwards in design. 

I sorta also finally get why the game tries to brand itself as a ""Faux Open World"" when there's a full on miles of sandbox to explore. It's because they barely try to program NPCs to behave like a human being. I remember the developers saying ""yes, the NPC will have animations that make them behaves like real people. Like in a coffee shop, you can see them managing orders."" Yeah, no Bro. It's even worse than Dead Rising NPCs, which would randomly get stuck. Apart from scripted cutscenes, NPC would literally don't know what to do even if you shoot them. 

The driving is actually good. It strikes a good balance of not being as arcady as GTA V, and is not as slippery or oversensitive with the steering like Watch Dogs. There's a momentum and weight to it. I actually drift a lot because it's so fun. But something about running over people is weird. You could nudge your car slowly at them and when they touch your bumper, they would literally flips and gets run over lmao. 

For the gameplay, it's interesting. They actually went out of their way to have more variety in missions. Like having stealth (it's pretty barebone), having tailing missions, using drones to fight enemies and having minigames. The minigame is ass though. Who thought it was a good idea to have a minigame about matching your controller L and R stick separately with the cursor in game and requiring you to do it perfectly? And using it for a shoveling? What? Or that one mission where you need to match a triangle except it needs to allign perfectly or you can't lock the position? 

Let's get back on track. The combat is serviceable. The lack of melee is fine because we can use our companion drone to stun an enemy, if you still have enough charge. But, the checkpoint in general is awful. I noticed it the first time in a chase sequence, where I literally was chasing this person for 5 minutes and I got stuck (because I didn't realize it was scripted and I tried to be smart) and I have to start over. The chase itself was brutally hard. 

The game's open world mostly serves as combat arena. You can hack robot, but only one at a time. And even then it barely works right. Sometimes the hacked robot would literally just stand there and do nothing. Or it immediately explode which I believe was scripted when there are no enemies left (except there are still enemies alive).


And the game itself is not challenging. It's really only hard when you are overwhelmed and got greedy trying to rush it. Which is hard not to do when the checkpoint would literally takes you back up to 5-7 minutes of your current combat encounters. You are not invincible, but you health regenarate if you wait. 

The cover is snappy, I like it. There's no blindfire from cover though. And I think there's a problem with the UI if I didn't even realize I have more weapons unlocked if I press the right Pad while in Weapon select. 

And yes, the shooting mechanic uses hitscan like GTA. Which means you can hide behind cover and still hit and enemy because the bullet's impact is at the reticle, not from your weapon. 

What else? The story is good. But I feel it doesn't properly explain a lot of what's going on. With the ending in particular feel underwhelming. I do like the set up for the later half of the game those. But the antagonist are not fleshed enough I feel. Set pieces are cool though. 

There's a lot of driving. Miles at times. I swear if they cut off driving, the game would probably be 7 hours at most. Not counting the bad checkpoints. 

For the glitches, maybe I'm lucky. But I don't really encounter any major bugs. Though I certainly doesn't try to break the game script. At most it's the enemy behaving weirdly. Or this one time when the protagonist was on the rocket and we have to use drone to scout the tracks, he somehow clipped through the railing and got stuck on the air. Or during a chase with a truck, the mission failed because the truck crashed and flipped (it somehow says my vehicle got stuck funny as hell).

It only crashed one time on my PC and the error says Exception Access Violation. 

On an RTX 3080, I was able to get a stable 80 FPS on a High preset with FSR Frame Generation at DLSS Balanced. Without it I get around 40-50 FPS at 4K.

Is it a good game? Yes. It's a no-brainer type game. 100% achievements is very easy. Combat can be hard, combined with bad checkpoints. 

Is it worth it? If you like PS3 era games and can tolerate the jank, sure. The open world is visually beautiful and pleasing to the eyes. The story is interesting, but I feel some characters are not fleshed out enough and the ending is underwhelming. And the emotional scenes actually hits.

Otherwise wait for discount. Believe it or not, the game is actually priced equivalent to $25 in my currency. That's why I don't mind buying this. But I would imagine it must hurts to pay for a game this unpolished for $60. So, tries to get a refund if you can.

For me this game is like a 6/10. 

I'm moving on to Stellar Blade now. ",3,1749745441.0,MindsEye,6,0.64,False

I have been with my person for 12 years, 2 kids 2 dogs. The works for being together this long.i work nights 12 hr shifts 8 days a week with random days off.early March something with her vibe just felt off, her voice, the way she answers me.stopped really looking at me.started making sure her emails were deleted. I start asking if anything's going on. Are you texting someone? I see little hints when I can gaze at her phone. Snapchat email confirmations. All while I'm being told I have nothing to worry about and that she loves me.she tells me she wants to feel better about her self and would like to. Buy something's for the bedroom.. (shawiiiing) new skirt, tops.. BP..dldo, she mentions this panty vibrator she can wear I can use on her while at work, OK! One afternoon I noticed she downloaded telegram so I download also and sync contacts. I see her on then off, on and then off on and off. All while I'm waiting for text responses or open Instagram videos or whatever.i kinda watch it for a few days and then one nights while at work I get tons of nudes from her. She never ever ever does that. I try to be cool about it but my anxiety grabs me and I call her out about being on telegram and I know what telegram is about and to screen shot me everything she's doing on there. She obviously denies and deletes everything and says she uses it for shopping.we're getting closer to Easter now and I felt so bad about it I decide I'm making her a Easter basket, nice blanket, new water bottle, favorite candy. New shoes I go all out for my apology. The card stated how I would do better at not assuming she was doing online infidelity. April 22nd..my d day.. my ground zero.. I wake up 1.5 hrs after closing my eyes from work to her doing something in the room.. she looks at me and says WHAT? I thought how weird of a way to respond. I go down stairs to get coffee and she's about out the door for work. Something just isn't sitting right I feel so off. She leaves and I start searching websites that she may be on. I find one called fetlife.. I'm sure most of you have heard of it. I make a profile and start searching usernames I would think she uses. Found her.. 25 pictures uploaded, 4 videos uploaded. Guys screen shotting them tributing. She has a ""dom"" on the site and his name is written across her chest she is his submissive. She joined the site in March. I screen shot as much as I can and I send it to her.. she calls off work and I'm breaking down on the phone .. you gaslit me for a month that it's in my head. You sat there and looked me in the eyes and said you love me and nothing is going on that you aren't doing anything.after the 5 hrs of phone calls and FaceTime she comes home. She's puking the whole time from her nerves from her shame and guilt. I'm digging for information. My anxiety craves details. She gives me the login for the email she used (new email) 663 notifications on fetlife..likes..messages.. about 30 notifications a day.. even on days I was off and I would go up and say goodnight and make sure she was put to sleep. She was up doing this.. after more talking she told me her dom had her make a second Snapchat.. now finding out there was cyber sex or whatever it's called.. in our bed she's video chatting these guys while I'm at work providing for our family. She's sending this guy pictures and videos through out the day everyday.. I never got that.. I never would get Goodmornings and she would usually always forget goodnight texts.. but they got all that.. she tells me as much as she can when ever I ask her anything. There's so many more questions I have but what will it do for me now? She may even just say she doesn't remember and it will still drive me crazy wondering if she's lying. I found numerous Reddit accounts of hers and she posted a NSFW photo 3 years ago... who is this women? I have been so messed up over all this.. checking her phone whenever I can. She plays a lot of warzone and it's on our sons PS5 so when friends are added I get a email about it.. I said why are you adding so many people you can't just play with randoms? I asked if they are people off of fetlife.. no no no they are randoms.. they were not randoms they were off of fetlife.. I don't know who this women was for that month.. she said she really got into smut books for awhile and got her curious. And she was looking into it and it got her going like a drug and then it made her feel like making a account and then the acknowledgement from everyone just kept her coming back for more and more.. all while I was asking her about our relationship everyday. Are we ok? Are you sure your not doing anything? She said she started to feel like there was cameras in our house becouse my timing and questions were so close. She felt so guilty.. but here I am. Almost 2 months post d day and I spiral.. I was leaving work early every day. I lost 36lbs in a week.. even just this morning we were talking about this issue. But now the more we go back into she is starting to get annoyed and upset that I'm not further along in my healing. I was seeing a therapist for 4 weeks and got no where with her. Just started a new one . And she is also doing solo therapy for herself and we will be doing couples therapy.. wow that was a lot. And the bad thing is I'm sure I left out some information. But I'm at work and I'm not even suppose to be on my phone.

Guess I'm looking for advice? Or just a place to vent since no one knows about this besides us. Thanks ",2,1749745298.0,BetrayalTrauma,0,1.0,False

Just curious, are there any cafés in this city that focus specifically on specialty coffee? I mean places that serve fresh brews from good beans, offer pour over or French press or something beyond the usual cappuccino and cold coffee.

I’ve seen a few cafés around but most seem more about food or ambiance than the actual coffee itself.

Also wondering,
- Would you like to see a place in the city that’s really focused on great coffee?
- What would you expect from such a café? (Ambience, pricing, menu, space for working or just chilling)
- What do you think it must have or should have?
- How much would you personally be okay paying for one visit?
- And if there was such a place, which area in the city would you love to see it in?

1l9qnu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l9qnu9/is_she_showing_red_flags/,Is she showing red flags?,"I've been dating a girl for over a year now. (37M/28F) We've had our ups and downs. I've been cheated on twice in my dating life, so I'm usually on heightened alert. However, I'm not controlling and know how to keep the insecurity at bay. However, I've been noticing things with my current girlfriend and trying to determine if these are major red flags or if I'm just over thinking things. 

-She's been friends with a guy since high school. He lives in a different state. When we started dating, she voluntarily told me that nothing ever happened between them. I never asked and never had a problem with it. One night during a fight, she randomly openly admitted that she slept with him when he came in town a month before we met. I was pretty upset that she lied to me when she voluntarily told me. I almost left that night since I felt like I lost some trust. 

-She's been friends with a guy that she met through mutual friends before we started dating. I thought they were more acquainted than close friends. Or atleast that's what she conveyed. One day we went to the restuarant he served at for brunch. He seemed really nice, but didn't serve us. He brought her a free coffee. When we walked outside she said, ""Hey stay here. I'm going to say bye to him."" He was serving outside on the patio and walked over by the patio. I thought that was weird. She disappeared for a few minutes, then came back all smiles. When we walked back to her place, she was giggity and talked about him. She voluntarily told me, ""We never did anything.""  Something seemed off. Her parents came in town over the holidays and wanted her parents to meet him and have brunch at his restuarant. It was weird. She really talked him up in front of her parents and her dad gave him a big tip. Her mom even said, ""Oh he's cute."" About 2 months ago we were going through a rough patch in our relationship and she got a little distant. One night on a date she started telling me that he was being unresponsive to her. I thought..""wait..how often do they talk?"" She was telling me they had some disagreements and he was being distant with her and said, ""I guess that's why I've been weird lately."" That set off alarm bells. I asked, ""How often do you guys talk."" ""Oh we talk often. We're pretty close."" I said, ""Oh...I didn't know that?"" She could tell I was bothered by it. ""Please don't be mad at me. I love you."" A couple of weeks passed and she would mention him here and there. One night during dinner she went on for about 20 minutes about her frustrations with him. She could tell I was getting a little annoyed and said, ""But it's okay..I have you."" I thought that comment was WEIRD. I looked at her and said, ""Um..that's a little weird."" My memory is fuzzy after that. Recently she told me that he hasn't been responsive at all towards her. She openly admitted that he tried to date her in the past, but wanted nothing more than just friends. I asked, ""Why didn't you tell me??"" ""I just didn't want you to get mad or worried. I'm sorry. You won..not the others."" I told her I wanted transparency. A few days ago we went to a festival and his restuarant had a tent. I said, ""Let's grab a sandwich."" The guy was working in the tent. She said, ""No...I don't want to talk to him.' Weird. Nothing has been said since. 

A few nights ago she showed me something on her phone. I grabbed her phone to look. Suddenly, a text from ""Blake"" popped up. I just smirked and thought, ""Oh boy here we go again."" I gave her phone back and she continued with the conversation and I heard ""Oh crap"" half way through as she continued. After she was done she asked, ""Are you okay?"" I said, ""Yeah I'm fine."" ""Are you sure?"" ""Yep I'm good."" I really didn't want to fight that night. The next day she told me that one of her friends from her home state recently got out of rehab and texted her. His name was ""Blake"". She went on about his history. ""He's still living at home since rehab and told him he should move to St. Louis."" I asked, ""Why St. Louis?""  ""Stuart just isn't a good place for him. He needs a fresh start."" I thought that was strange. This week, she's been slightly distant and not very responsive. 

I feel like things aren't adding up with her. On top of these issues, she has bad anxiety and depression that she's medicated for. I also feel like I'm not meeting her emotional needs from a guy and she's finding it in others. Am I overthinking things, or is she untrustworthy?",1,1749745211.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
