Created the account a minute ago due to my need to say this because I can't pretend to suppress my urge anymore. I searched ""lonely"" and this is what came out, here, on this subreddit. A few days ago I turned 20 years old, had no celebrations at all because I live alone at my family's other house that is closer to my university than where my family's (six hours away) every day I discover and don't discover something about myself. I'm not just feeling lonely. I'm feeling miserable due to loneliness and the lack of friends. While I appreciate having friends but I also somewhat hate to socialize. And I'm not an introvert. You don't understand how many times a day I think about giving up and suicide but I can't let my family see or know anything about it, so instead of that I hope from the bottom of my heart that there'll be ""an accident"" in which someone does it for me. In my early life I have been so religious so close to my religion but at the same time a very ignorant person. later I saw people and the world for it's uglyness and cold-heartedness and I had whish to never see it, at the same time grateful for it. Sometimes I think I'm a psychopathic person and my lack of identity to myself. Sure, people see me for, and I quote them"" kind and good person "" oh, I'm not so sure about it. In fact I don't think I  understand myself. I'm afraid to go to a therapist for two reasons. One being, what my family will think of me? . And two, will the therapist understand me? I don't know what my problem(s) are. But one thing I'm pretty sure about: i will never feel happy or wanted by anyone. There's so much that I can talk about, the people. Me. And other social issues that exists in this merciless I truly hope that what I'm going through is just a phase and eventually goes away. Man, I wonder if I'm a real person with real and valid emotions. I don't know. I just don't know how to express my thoughts in an orderly manner. You don't have to respond with the ""you matter! I love you"" blank and empty words. Reading this is enough for me. ",2,1730844369.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

I never believed in love at first sight. At 29, I was focused on my career, thinking love was for others, not me. But everything changed when I met her on a rainy Tuesday at my favorite coffee shop.

She came in, hair wet from the rain, looking for a seat. I invited her to join me, and we started talking. The silence was comfortable, and something about her felt magnetic.

Over the next few weeks, we met almost daily, sharing stories about our lives. She was 27, and our connection felt natural, as if we‚Äôd known each other forever.

One evening, as we left the coffee shop, she told me, ‚ÄúI never thought I could connect with someone like this.‚Äù It was a moment of clarity for both of us. I realized love isn‚Äôt about perfection; it‚Äôs about being seen and heard.

That night, we shared our first kiss‚Äîgentle and perfect. Our lives intertwined unexpectedly, and I found myself believing in love.

1gkikjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HydroHomies/comments/1gkikjv/schools_of_hydrothought_regarding_coffee_or_i/,"""Schools of hydro-thought regarding coffee"" or ""I would eat coffee if I could""","On the one hand coffee has water, which is good. But on the other hand, coffee contains things other than water, which pollutes it. In this coffee is similar to other drinks, like soda or juice, but I want to focus on the specific properties of coffee, so as to not broaden the topic too much.

The objective of coffee consumption is to absorb caffeine and enjoy its effects on wakefulness and energy. Whether this is good, or bad in the long-term is similarly out of scope, the question I pose is, assuming one does consume coffee, what are good and bad ways to consume it.

I posit thus the espresso theory, that consuming coffee as a generic thirst-quenching drink is bad, as it replaces water. A better way to drink coffee is to have both a coffee and a water container simultaneously, first drinking to satiate thirst, and then consuming caffeine only to the extent it is desired, not mixing the two desires or satisfactions. 

For this the espresso becomes objectively better, as its water content is less, as opposed to an Americano. The Latte or Flat white to a lesser extent, introduce a third item into the mix which is food, caloric nutrition, which brings it into the soda domain, especially if sugar is added, which is blasphemous.

The reduction in water in a substance improving our consumption of water is paradoxical, but again, our water intake is constant, we are merely transferring water consumption to a purer form.  
  
The next step in coffee purification and dehydration would be to eat coffee, whether in bean form, powdered form, or processed into some kind of pastry. However I personally have not seen many people consume coffee this way, which leads me to believe there might be some disadvantage to it. Even if we were to eat coffe like so, we would probably take some water to pass it down, and possibly not extract the caffeine as effectively, and potentially have even worse stomach issues.  
  
So the espresso is the best coffee for the hydro-literate.

*Memory Transcript: Elias Meier, General-Secretary of the United Nations, July 19, 2136*

I walk towards the podium, feeling anxious. Who wouldn't? I looked back at my notes. It was a simple speech, but I couldn't afford to mess this up.

My hands were sweating, as I felt the weight of the world itself bare down upon me. But I couldn't sit around and do, that isn't who I am. So I took my step into the conference room, hoping for the best.

As soon as my body came into view of the reporters, my eyes were hit with camera flashes. *I've had worse, can't let this stop me.*

I reach the stairs of the podium, walking up them in less than a few seconds. I didn't want to have to have to do this in a press room, but it was better to have all the world's major media corporations hear the news first, so information could spread faster throughout the world. I could deal with individual nations later.

I looked into the crowd of a hundred reporters. This would be the biggest moment of their lives,  the biggest moment of my life, and the biggest moment of everyone's life, perhaps the biggest moment in humanity‚Äôs history.

I collected myself, and took a deep breath of air.

‚ÄúA few days ago, rumors circulated that the *UNS Odyssey* returned much earlier than what was scheduled. I can confirm that, yes, those rumors are true.‚Äù I said as professionally and calmly as I could. Years of politics prevent me from breaking down and showing my emotions. I am a leader, I  can't fear now, I must lead by example!

Quickly, a hundred questions were asked, mostly including ‚Äòwhy‚Äô.

‚ÄúThey returned early because they found it. They found alien life.‚Äù This was the sentence that should've been the most important thing said for the rest of the press conference. And it would, but it wouldn't be the most pressing‚Ä¶

The room exploded in camera flashes and clicks and questions of all manner.

‚ÄúThey didn't find prokaryotic life. They didn't find eukaryotic life. They didn't even find complex, sentient life. They found sapient, space-faring life.‚Äù

Once again, the room exploded, hundreds of camera flashes hit my eye, each reporter trying to get the photo they would be known for.

I took a deep breath, calming my nerves down.

‚ÄúThis, however, isn't what matters. Noah Williams, Hal, and Sara Rosario found a galactic Federation. This Federation is hostile to human life. Their ideology is that all creatures that are capable of eating meat are ‚Äòpredatory‚Äô and must be destroyed. Unfortunately, this includes us.‚Äù

I could see the dark eyes of cameras recording me, millions of souls who dreamed of aliens were crushed behind each and every one of them. I grabbed and readjusted the microphone, because, despite everything, there still was some good news to say.

That doesn't mean all alien life is hostile.The crew first encountered a people who call themselves ‚ÄòVenlil‚Äô. These people are a race of aliens that are vaguely sheep-like. Governor Tarva, leader of the planet Venlil Prime helped them escape from the shuttle bay of Captain Sovlin, a Gojid, who is part of the Federation‚Äôs Fleet.

There is, however, another species humanity should know, is that they would undeniably accept humanity, but which humanity would not. They call themselves the Arxur. I, and my advisors, believe that a major reason that the Federation hates ‚Äòpredators‚Äô  is a race called the Arxur, who eat and enslave Federation species as cattle.‚Äù

The flashes pick up their pace. I took a glance at the reporters face‚Äôs, most of which were shocked and confused. A few were morphing into anger.

‚ÄúHumanity is in immense danger, and the fact that Governor Tarva took so much risk to help us buy time. Humanity has been discovered. We are in danger, and our actions in the next few months will be paramount to the continued survival of humanity itself.

If you wish for more information on this, Erin Kruemper from SETI is the place to go. SETI will house all information we have on Federation species.‚Äù

I quickly left the room, to avoid the hundreds of questions I would no doubt be inundated with. The questions would still come, but at least I wouldn't be the sole answerer.

I felt bad for throwing Erin under the bus, but she was giddy with the folders of information we had on aliens.

I had to plan ahead now.

[TIME SKIP: 4 DAYS, 3 HOURS, 48 MINUTES, 37 SECONDS]

*Memory Transcript: Elias Meier, General-Secretary of the United Nations, July 23, 2136*

The upgrades had finished much faster than I had expected. In hindsight, I should have expected it. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, even if they are my enemy. I suppose the threat of total human extinction tends to light a fire underneath even mortal enemies to work together.

The hangar storing the Odyssey was particularly dim, but not so much as to be impossible to navigate. More like reading light dim.

The shuttle itself was a dark gray, the exterior being smoother than a pool ball. The shape was like that of early stealth bombers, which given the time constraints, was a wise idea. Better to fall on old reliable than take gambles on the design.

I could only really hope that this would actually work, given that these were literally aliens, and who knows what sort of near-magic trick they could pull. Hopefully they didn't have the ‚ÄòThree Bodies Problem‚Äô level of technology, but I could only hope.

Jones and Zhao stood beside me, on my right and left respectively. Jones sported her signature sunglasses and casual stance and posture, while Zhao stood with perfect posture, a serious face and a perfect to regulation haircut.

‚ÄúIs everything in order?‚Äù I said as I took a sip from my coffee.

I already knew the answer, but I simply wanted confirmation, to silence any worries that were still persistent in my heart and mind.

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Zhao responded immediately.

‚ÄúWhat about what General Jones wanted added?‚Äù

She had wanted the craft to attempt to hack into the Internet of the Federation. Of course, this had many implications, such as ‚Äòdoes the Federation have an Internet system‚Äô and ‚Äòif so, does their Internet connect to each member state?‚Äô

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Jones responded casually, hands in her pockets, sunglasses adorned.

I was personally quite conflicted on the idea, as this would completely backfire and/or simply not work. Zhao himself was completely against the idea, as this could take more time to complete, thus wasting time. I have a feeling this was more out of national pride than anything, as while publicly the United States and China pledged to ‚Äòcooperate with all available resources to combat potential Federation aggression,‚Äô the rivalry between said nations had not gone away, but simply been tempered for now. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, after all.

‚ÄúWhen will the Odyssey take flight again?‚Äù I asked. I hadn't checked on the ship for one simple reason: work. I had spent so much time in the last few days working on plans to protect humanity, talking with leaders of nations and so much more. Coffee was the only thing that kept my heartbeat, along with a healthy dose and responsibility and fear.

Jones checked her watch, a brilliant Rolex, quite the contrast to Zhao‚Äôs Casio.

‚ÄúAt one, so in... 10 minutes,‚Äù she responded.

‚ÄúWhat about the Arks? When will they be ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe first Ark will be ready for testing in one month.‚Äù Zhao replied.

Too slow for my liking. I could work on that later.
Besides, I was about to be the third human to travel outside the solar system itself. 

My mission? To perform the best diplomacy that had ever been performed in the history of mankind.

I tugged at my tie, hoping that not even a blemish of dirt was on me. First impressions matter quite a bit, although I knew that deep down, the Venlil would see a ‚Äòscary predator‚Äô and not a diplomat.

‚ÄúZhao, you know what to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù he responded crisply.

Zhao was to be acting Secretary-General. He was a fine choice, all things considered, given how calm and collected he was. The only time I had seen him in any other emotion that wasn't intense stoicism was when a hot cup of coffee was spilled onto his favorite suit by an assistant. He wasn't angry, simply disappointed at the poor lady. Another perk was that he wasn't a wild card, unlike Jones.

‚ÄúGood luck, Meier,‚Äù Jones said.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

With goodbyes given, I walked down towards the Odyssey. Each step felt heavy, but I would not yield, not until I had done what needed to be done. I could see scientists and technicians all rushing around like ants, each doing their part, at the center of this mad rush to final checks was the crew out the Odyssey. The main cargo door was open, no doubt for me.

I reached the Odyssey, the technological marvel of our lifetimes, the discoverer of new frontiers. 

I took my first steps onto the ship. Then my next steps, and I continued until I reached the top.

The crew of the Odyssey stood up to greet me.

‚ÄúGood afternoon, Noah, Sara and Hal.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood afternoon Secretary-General,‚Äù the crew responded in sync, each providing a crisp salute.

‚ÄúNo need to be so professional with me. Anyways, is everyone ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù responded Hal, tapping away at a keyboard.

I noted that his pet rabbit was next to his seat, eating a piece of lettuce.

Inside the ship, I could see all the stuff the scientists hauled into the ship, including foodstuff items for cultural exchange. While I had no idea if aliens were gluttons or not, bribery by apples and oranges may actually work. Besides, glassing the planets that have the best sweets will be a massive deterrent if we can spread treats all the way up to at least the Federation leaders' children.

It was, of course, Jones who proposed this idea.

I walked to the fourth seat, right next to Hal and behind Sara. I set my suitcase, filled with information about Humanity. Our arts, our story and our plays, both on paper and on computer. I had basically all of Earth's known history on the computer, from the early formations of the planet itself up until about a few months ago. 

I didn't know how entrenched Federation citizens were in anti-predator hatred, or if I could get to Chief Nikonus, apparent leader of the Federation and of Afaa, but if I could somehow convince the population instead of the leaders or vice versa Humanity would stand a real chance. Although, preferably the population instead of the leaders.

I was shaken from my musing as I could feel the Odyssey lifting off slowly yet surely from the spaceport, my heart beating quickly. I didn't like the sensation.

Quickly though, the cameras to the outside of the new and quickly fastened hull showed the Earth, in its full, magnificent glory. A swirling hurricane, just in the beginning of its life, was forming in the Gulf of Mexico. I could see the beautiful blue and green hues of our blue marble, a pale blue dot in comparison to the universe, but this is all we have.

This is what hung on the balance, the weight on my shoulders. I could only hope that I could protect her with all my might.

**Devotional: United in His Love: Embracing the Power of Christian Fellowship**

**Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42-47 (NIV)**

*‚ÄúThey devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.‚Äù*

- - - - - -

**Reflection:**

In our journey of faith, one truth stands out brightly: we are called to be united in Christ‚Äôs love. The early church exemplified this beautifully, devoting themselves to teaching, fellowship, prayer, and sharing meals. Their lives intertwined, each believer contributing to the community in a beautiful display of love and support.

Christian fellowship is more than simply gathering; it‚Äôs an active relationship rooted in shared faith and love. It‚Äôs in these gatherings where we find strength, encouragement, and accountability‚Äîelements essential for spiritual growth. In a world that often promotes individualism, we are reminded that God designed us for community.

**Power in Fellowship:**

1. **Encouragement and Support:**  
  When we walk alongside fellow believers, we share in each other‚Äôs burdens and joys. Just as Paul wrote to the Romans, we are to ‚Äúrejoice with those who rejoice‚Äù and ‚Äúmourn with those who mourn‚Äù (Romans 12:15). This act of sharing fosters deeper connections and reflects the heart of God‚Äôs love.
2. **Strengthening Our Faith:**  
  Engaging with others in fellowship can reinforce our faith. Hearing testimonies, sharing struggles, and praying together can help us see God‚Äôs hand at work in our lives, bolstering our trust in Him.
3. **Being the Hands and Feet of Jesus:**  
  When we unite in love, we become conduits of God‚Äôs grace. Our collective efforts can meet practical needs, provide support for the hurting, and spread the good news of Jesus in tangible ways. The early church‚Äôs commitment to sharing and caring for one another serves as a model for us today.
4. **Shaping Our Character:**  
  Fellowship allows us to grow in wisdom and understanding. We learn from one another, encourage personal and spiritual development, and sharpen each other as iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17).

- - - - - -

**Prayer:**

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the gift of fellowship and for placing us in a community filled with love and grace. Help us to embrace the power of Christian fellowship in our lives. May we be a source of encouragement to one another, share our burdens, and rejoice in our victories together. Teach us to love unconditionally and to recognize the beauty in our differences as we unite in Your love. Guide us in using our gifts to serve one another and the world around us. Thank You for adding daily to our number and for allowing us to witness the wonders of Your love in community.

In Jesus‚Äô name, we pray,

Amen.

- - - - - -

**Action Step:**

This week, reach out to someone in your church or community. Invite them to coffee, pray with them, or offer assistance in a practical way. Engage actively in fellowship, and allow God‚Äôs love to flow through you, strengthening both your faith and the bonds you share. Let‚Äôs commit to being a haven of support and love, demonstrating Christ‚Äôs heart in our interactions.

I am a 16 year old introvert girl who despite everything loves interacting with others, but cant because of social anxiety. In my school, im good with everyone overall but only have one friend who i go to lunch with, go to coffee shops with, ramble about everything and anything to her, open up to her. Shes like a sister to me. I slept over at her house for days for the first time this year even though I couldn't before due to my strict parents. She was the one who encouraged me to study when i wouldn't (but really, i have had depression since 6th grade and it comes back after every minor inconvenience). 

But now? It sucks. We stopped hanging out. She basically kicked me out of my seat, told me to sit somewhere else (the first seats are available but I don't want to be close eye to eye with the professors), told me not to talk to her or hang out with her . Why? Why is all my mind keeps repeating in my head. I did nothing to her. Nothing. She knows I'm too sensitive and feel too bad to even think badly or say something bad about someone. I paid for her meals countless times and when we went to coffee shops I insisted on paying, because I truly loved her and didn't care if she had no money. I had some, and so if she is hungry she will eat. 

She sent me this message 2 days ago: 
""Hey
I need some space. Could i sit alone in my place for a while and you somewhere else? I am not stable at the moment and I would like to be alone, I told ____. please dont ask me what's wrong and approach me. When I'm ready, I'll tell you. I hope you understand me and that you will fulfill my wish.""

I honestly feel so hurt, just seeing her avoid me like the plague and having to control myself to not look at her or approach her. Our classmates all kept asking me these 2 days what's up with us. I'm sick of it. I'm so sick of it. Maybe me and her were never meant to be friends at all. She will never tell me, I bet. But I don't know what to do. At all. I'm crying over her and I hate that so much. This always happens to me. 

I have been so unstable since the start of high-school, but I never dared to distance myself away from my friends. I want to be there for them even if they don't know what goes through my mind. 

Please tell me what I should do. I need advice ",1,1730843224.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

So my mum is down from up country this weekend and is very assertive as to plans that should be accomplished whilst she is down. So my partner and I had plans just to go out this Saturday with my daughter completely forgetting my mum was meant to be down so we have now had to reschedule as too far for her dog to be left and started our call this evening stating she was disappointed and felt like she was being pushed out, I explained wasnt the case and I had just forgotten as I have had a lot going on but accepted I was in the wrong for forgetting so now plans will be changed. 

Long story short, there has been talk of going out with the rest of the family I barely have contact with I feel uncomfortable in their presence and is very much no contact apart from when my mum is down due to their lack of interest in anyone but themselves. I have tried to communicate my discomfort before as I normally get roped into going to theirs prior, a meal and then back for a coffee and by this point I have to take my child to their dads so I feel as though I have spent all my day rushing round focusing on everyone else that are barely a presence in my life. My partner has said he will speak to them for me but I know how this may come across and may cause even more of a backlash. Even more backstory my mum is my landlord so dont want to rock the boat too much just in case!

Once you are finished, pass it around to your family/anyone you‚Äôll travel with. When every family member is done, add up each family member rating to determine the state with the highest score. 

Once you are finished, have your family members/ anyone you‚Äôll travel with pick and write their rating of the state next to yours. When every family member is done, add up each family member rating to determine the state with the highest score. 

Whatever state with the greatest number is the state your family would most likely enjoy.

Here's what i generally prefer in taste profile. I like something more on the sweeter side. Chocolate, toffee...those kinds of tastes is what i prefer. Will be looking at a dark or medium dark roast to start with as i had read it's easier to dial in for beginners compared to light roasts. Any help or advice would be great!

I did a little bit of a research, I wrote a four page long letter dedicated to him in which I just let out my thoughts and talked to him deeply, all I could feel as I wrote was goosebumps and a strange burning feeling in my chest, like I had just drank liquor. When I got home, after buying a candle and some cinnamon flavored incense I set up a little altar dedicated to him, with little offerings like my custom Loki coffee cup, made in ceramic and carved out by a really talented artist, I tried to communicate through the candle light which was incredible, I made sure all the windows and door were closed, and that I wasn‚Äôt breathing on the flame.
The flame was very calm but flickered like crazy anytime ONLY when I asked some specific questions, like if he‚Äôs there, listening, if I was doing something wrong somehow. I couldn‚Äôt find my tarot cards (which I can‚Äôt even read yet) so I used dices to communicate.
Even numbers for positive answers and odd numbers for negative,
and the more they got specific the more it was incredible how the answers seemed to come actually by him, he would give me a one very often when the answer was negative and the craziest thing is that when I used two dices together, I asked him to give me an eight (which is his number) twice in two different times, and he gave me an eight first try both times, which he never gave me again for other questions.
I don‚Äôt know, I might be crazy, I don‚Äôt know what to believe, but the more time passes the more drawn to him I feel.
Can somebody help me, or teach me what to do when communicating with him? I seriously don‚Äôt know anything, not even how to seriously communicate with a deity. It‚Äôs my first time at everything and with this happening I feel like i‚Äôm going crazy or being delusional.
I don‚Äôt know why I did all this in the span of two days when it didn‚Äôt even cross my mind a few days ago, I felt the impulse to do it, to talk to Loki, am I doing the right thing?",4,1730841218.0,lokean,3,1.0,False

","*Warning* this is long, but I really need advice and opinions, and this is a very specific scenario. I have discussed this with my boyfriend at length. 

My boyfriend (27M) said he hasn't been sexually satisfied with me (25F), telling me to initiate and make sex exciting for him ""for the last year."" We started dating 7/14/2023. So almost a year and four months ago. I am currently 19 weeks pregnant with our son.

After some introspection, I can admit that I have not initiated sex with him as much as I could have, and that's fully on me. I have a mental block, stemming from insecurity I guess or fear of rejection, that just makes it hard for me to start things. I have reactive desire, so I have hardly ever turned him down. Except for in the last few weeks, when we have been arguing, because I have genuinely not wanted to have sex with him in those moments.

Three days ago he told me he won't continue being with me, having a ""boring, vanilla, mediocre"" sex life, because all I do is ""lay there"" and put in no effort. He said he's been asking me for a year to get better and nothing's changed.

What's hard for me to understand is this: one year ago, and for most of the first year we were together, we were drinking and doing cocaine a lot. For the first time in my life actually. I did A LOT with him sexually. We used to watch porn together, specifically have videos of girls in bikinis or in gym shorts, on the tv while we had sex, often for hours. I confided in him about dark intimate fantasies I had, that were honestly shameful to me when I was sober. He thought I was a
""cuckquean"" and would talk about fucking these girls in front of me. He wanted to have a threesome with me and ""let me"" kiss girls at the bar. He hit me during sex, spat in my mouth/face, used a whip on me, pissed on me, etc. All of this was consensual and I agreed to it, and I even prompted some aspects of it. But, most if not all of this occurred when I was drunk and on cocaine.

The issue was, I didn't like watching porn with him sober. I tried a few times, and I got in my head too much, and would feel insecure, because the porn we were watching wasn't straight porn, it was usually lesbian and/or just girls doing bikini try ons or stretching in leggings. There were times he would verbalize on and on about stuff during sex, how hot she is, how fat her ass is, etc etc that started to get in my head. Granted he would eat me out and make sure my needs were met at this time. But doing it sober, was not an option for me.
I could do rough sex sober, but that was it. We had many, many arguments about it, and he told me to just be consistent, watch porn fucked up and sober the same. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get into it sober, and my feelings would always get hurt. When I was drunk and high I could roll with the feeling of being degraded like that, when I was sober it was too difficult for me, and I preferred what was just ""regular sex"" to him. While I was drunk and high I would engage with his fantasies, I would actively watch and porn and comment on women with him, but as time went on, my feelings changed, and that has been incomprehensible to him. 

I didn't stop getting fucked up and watching porn and doing all of this with him until June of this year, but I slowly began to establish the boundary that I didn't like it as much anymore. I had never done it with anyone before. I didn't know that I was taking it too far until I was; I basically discovered my boundaries as I went. As our relationship became more serious too, and was way less causal, I became more possessive of him and less okay thinking about having our women in our relationship, even in fantasy. And there were times, that he actively disrespected my boundaries, that haunted me. One time in particular, because I had been up arguing with him about porn because I didn't want to put it on and we had ""spent money on drugs to have a good night,"" he repeatedly yelled at me ""what the fuck is wrong with you,"" over and over, while I was crying, told me to watch the porn he had on tv while I said ""no"" but he held my head back by my hair and forced me to watch it anyway while he fucked me, then pissed on me. I went to the shower and cried after and slept alone on the couch. It went beyond a BDSM scene or
""something we had done before"" because I said no and he didn't stop. That kind of broke something in me too, and I just stopped wanting to do that with him.

In this time in my life I was also slowly becoming very depressed. We lost both of our jobs. Literally because, we kept doing cocaine and watching porn all night, and calling into work. Life was so stressful. Money was tight. Time went by, we kept fighting and occasionally watching porn anyway, sometimes I got into it, sometimes not, but whenever I got into it I was high and drunk and felt confident in myself. When I was sober I did not have enough confidence to do it. That was my mistake too, that I kept doing it with him, even after I realized I should have stopped, and consistently ""not"" done it, and maybe gotten more into something else. But I felt like I had no choice but to continue that routine, and sometimes when I was fucked up I genuinely didn't mind it at all and was perfectly okay with it, as confusing as that is. Around this time I also made it clear to him that I thought we had a problem with cocaine and/or alcohol. He told me he did not, because he could handle himself. I was the one with the problem, because I couldn‚Äôt be consistently into porn and what we were doing sexually drunk and sober every single time, so I was the one causing strain in our relationship. I had to ‚Äúmake up my mind,‚Äù and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to watch porn anymore. Then somehow, days later, high and drunk, I would bring it up again. Genuinely I didn‚Äôt want to or mean to, it was just our routine, and I knew it made him happy, even though it hurt me. This only made things more confusing for both of us. But I still only ever brought it up when I was drunk and high. 

In July, I left him. We had a fight when we were drunk and high. He said I was ""too close"" to other guys at the bar. He hit me and broke a glass coffee table. That wasn't the first time, but the last time, and I was done forgiving him for it. So l packed all of my things and left. He begged and begged and begged for me to come back. Called me every day crying. Said he'd do anything, promised to get help for his behavior. Little did I know that I was pregnant at the time. When I found out I told him, I wasn't sure what to do, but he resolutely told me to keep the baby, he wanted the baby, he wanted me and the baby to come back because we were a family now. So I did. Also on me. Stupidly, I did love him very much, because sex with him was great for me even when it was just ""regular,"" and he was very funny, fun to be around, and lovable. And I wanted the baby. So I came back, moved back everything, and I mean everything, I had moved out of my apartment, and went back to him.

A huge reason ""why"" he gave me for treating me the way he did was that he was never sober, we never tried being sober, and cocaine and alcohol made him act violent toward me. I stopped completely as soon as I knew I was pregnant, and he told me he would cut back. We stopped watching porn while having sex. I was okay with this. Especially being pregnant, l'm hormonal, my body is changing, I didn't want to see and/or hear him talk about ""thick gym girls"" anymore. I wanted to feel special, I guess. To him though this translated to me becoming a ""bad sub."" Because I no longer wanted to do absolutely everything (I.e. watch porn, because I was still willing to have rough sex) he asked of me as a dom, I added nothing new and exciting to our sexual relationship, actually added nothing of value to our relationship at all, was boring, didn't take care of myself, didn't get dressed up for him, didn't brush my hair or put on makeup, didn't try. All things he said to me. In retrospect, I could have put more effort into doing that and I'm sad now I didn't. I was actually so, so depressed and overwhelmed and still am. My family wasn't happy with the pregnancy and didn't feel supportive of me, we still fought about sex, he had knee surgery and went out on disability and couldn't do anything around the house, we still took care of his two other children on the weekends, we didn't have money to go to the gym anymore, or money for food- it has been a terrible time in my life.
And his too. He's been depressed and crying in bed and I've laid there and told him everything would be okay. And I really hoped it would.

But this weekend, he told me sex was terrible, his needs weren't being met, he is an ""attractive man and I don't treat him like one or compliment him,"" some girl told him his ""confidence was sexy"" and that made him realize how ""little effort I put into our relationship,"" | ""neutered"" our sex life by not watching porn and not being a sub for him anymore, he's done cocaine plenty without me and he can masturbate to porn still and he does, I just told him he can do it in the other room, and he said that made him feel ""ashamed of his desires"" and like I was kink shaming him. And he didn't want to be with someone who didn't sexually satisfy him anymore. I ""gave him issues over everything and was never happy""‚Äî- because on Halloween we stayed out until 8am in the morning and I wasn't happy about it. I have felt so alone recently, because he retracts and plays video games for hours. But it's my fault I don't want to sit next to him and watch for more than 10 minutes, or learn how to play (and I have tried in the past, I just have no real desire to play fast paced shooter games, I'm sorry). He told me he
""stopped listening to me talk about my day"" or care because I stopped making sex enjoyable for him. I stopped ""chasing"" him and making him feel good about himself. Truthfully l've just been so overwhelmed by life and caught up in my head and worried about my pregnancy.

I've been so, so incredibly hurt by all of this. I understand I could have done more. I could have initiated more often. Cared more about myself, dressed up or whatever. Done something to boost my self confidence and his. But honestly I've been overwhelmed. Hormonal and tired since I found out I was pregnant. My sex drive has still been there. But l've been way more sensitive. I explained all of this to him. But it was no excuse, because he said he's been asking me to change
""for the last year"" and I ignored him, and this was his final straw in our relationship. If that's true, I asked him, why did he beg for me to come back when I physically left and you were free to move on? Why did he want the baby so bad then, only to tell me days ago I need to abort the baby now, 3 months later? I just started feeling the baby move. l've been attached. We picked out a name.
And now at 19 weeks in the second trimester he wants me to abort so we can break up.

I am so truly distraught and falling apart. I've considered su*cide. Ive thought about my life raising my son with no support and no father as he refuses to claim his son if I have the baby because he can't afford another child support payment. But I wanted my baby so much. I wanted to be with him too. I feel so blindsided by all of this, and I knew I could have initiated more, I told him that, I said I was sorry, I told him I would put more effort into myself and think of ways to make sex more exciting. But, just no more watching soft core porn of other ""hot girls"" anymore- it makes me uncomfortable, especially now that I'm pregnant. our current routine is basically me giving him head and riding him because he can't put weight on his knee since it's been healing. But I don't even ride him for long enough I guess. A week or so ago he ate me out for the first time in forever and sex was great because he never does that anymore. He said he stopped doing that when he realized I didn't care about his pleasure, even though I literally give him a blowjob almost every time we have sex. He said he had to tell me every thing to do in bed, every position to switch to, guide the whole thing. As a dom I have let him, that's true, and he never minded until I told him no to porn. because I can't be a good sub and not do everything he wants.

Am I allowed to have that boundary? Is that so wrong, for me to say I don't want to stare at another woman's ass while we have sex now that I'm pregnant and sober, even though it was okay while I was high and drunk before? I don't want to.
My feelings have been hurt over it. But he won't accept this, says I did it plenty with him and ""lied"" to him about what I could handle. I did, with him for the first time ever in my life, and I felt that he took that for granted and used me for it. And when I established my boundary at last with him, he hasn't been able to get over it or accept it. Is it wrong that I want to feel special to him and be resolutely the only woman in his life? I feel bad he said I don't make him feel special anymore, and I told him l'd put in more effort. I'd overcome all the stress and depression l've been going through.
Get new sexy outfits that fit, take better care of myself, whatever. Compliment him more. But even all that, with ""but no more porn,"" isn't enough.
I am so so sad. It would be one thing had he not misled me into keeping this pregnancy, telling everyone I was pregnant, being excited it was boy, telling his daughters I was pregnant, me becoming excited about myself now that I'm 5 months pregnant. Just to tell me 2 days ago, multiple times, get an abortion.

I don't know what to do. More than anything I just want to know, am I being unreasonable? Seriously.
Is this my fault for not initiating sex more when I could have? Is there a misunderstanding between us? Is he being unreasonable or just stating his feelings? I feel actually crazy right now and have been for days. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long. Thank you for reading.

I thought we really hit it off we were talking quite a bit on there and exchanged numbers after a few days. I asked her out and we went out less than a week after we initially matched. She actually came over first date, which I know is probably not usually wise, we just walked to get coffee then walked around a bit outside then talked at my place for like an hour. We did kiss before she left and I thought it went good. She texted me literally like 2 hours after she left saying she had a great time. I asked pretty quickly if she wanted to go out for dinner that week and we agreed on Wednesday we would. That was a Saturday when we first went out. She said the next day she was leaving for like a 1 day trip and would be driving most of the day so I figured we wouldn‚Äôt text much that Sunday. She sent me one text that Sunday it was just like a photo of her at her hotel saying she‚Äôd made it safely. she was going to a concert that night. I replied to that text and then didn‚Äôt hear from her until like end of the day the next day when she said she‚Äôd made it back home. 

That week was kinda weird I really didn‚Äôt hear from her much Monday or Tuesday we texted a few times her responses got really delayed and I‚Äôm not a double texter so the conversation kinda fizzled. Which was disappointing because the previous week we had talked a lot and the date went well. Anyway Wednesday rolls around and I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was even still interested in talking let alone going out again. So I texted her like 2 or 3 pm that day and asked if she still wanted to get dinner. She gets off work later than me by quite a bit and had mentioned her commute takes a long time and she‚Äôd had a really busy week at work so I offered to pick her up, meet her, or wtvr was easiest for her. She responded said she did still want to hangout again but asked if she could just come over and we get ice cream. She said she could only hangout for like an hour because she was so tired. So she came over we walked to get ice cream (I live in a walkable area if you can‚Äôt tell) then sat on my patio for about an hour. I walked her to her car we kissed she left. She texted me when she got home thanked me for the ice cream and we texted back and forth a few times. Thursday night we did talk actually back and forth over test for a couple hours which I wasn‚Äôt expecting cuz as I‚Äôve said the rest of that week we barely talked besides when she came over Wednesday. She said she was going on a trip with her family that weekend so I figured we wouldn‚Äôt talk much but I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to basically Ghost me. I didn‚Äôt hear from her Friday Saturday or Sunday. Monday came around I texted her like middle of the day and asked if she was alright and she replied said yes that she had a crazy busy last few days. I had been getting the feeling she was no longer interested obviously so i replied and just asked if she was still interested in seeing each other. She replied that she underestimated how much she has going on currently and it‚Äôs hard for her to have time to date right now. She also said she isn‚Äôt in a good place with herself and wants to get to a good place before dating anyone. So I was nice and just said I was disappointed but I understand and no worries.

Some other details that may be important. She just graduated college last year and she told me a few days into talking that she lives at home with her parents and has since she graduated. I had no issue with that and told her I did the same thing when I graduated I understand completely. Anyway, I know the whole thing didn‚Äôt last long as you can tell but I really thought we hit it off at first and the fact she wanted to go out a second time makes me think the first date must not have been that bad. Normally If  someone is repulsed by you they don‚Äôt want to go out again and don‚Äôt text you 2 hours after the first date saying what a good time they had lol. She was really into talking at the start she asked me a lot about myself, my family, job, etc. she was pretty flirty early on. I am not sure where I went wrong or if I did go wrong. I felt like there was a connection at first and it could‚Äôve gone some place. This was about 2 months ago and I‚Äôve been wanting to reach out to her just a casual text asking how she‚Äôs been. Based on this story and details do you think there‚Äôs any realistic chance she is interested and it truly just wasn‚Äôt good timing?

That‚Äôs a wild claim, so let‚Äôs do the math, and spoiler alert ‚Äì this level of phone work is basically superhero territory.

# 1. Number of Courses He‚Äôd Need to Sell

To hit that cool $5 million mark, here‚Äôs what Wes would need in terms of raw sales numbers:

* **Total Revenue Target:** $5,000,000
* **Course Price:** $3,000

**Courses Needed = Total Revenue / Course Price**  
Or, plugging in our numbers:  
5,000,000 / 3,000 ‚âà **1,667 courses per month**

**That‚Äôs 1,667 separate people** every month willing to shell out $3,000 to chat for an hour. Already, this starts to feel like some serious volume, but hey ‚Äì let‚Äôs keep going.

# 2. Time on the Phone: Can Wes Handle It?

Now, if he‚Äôs committing to **one hour on the phone per client** (and we‚Äôre not talking group calls or recorded Q&As here, just straight-up one-on-one), then he‚Äôs got to deliver 1,667 hours of his time every month. How does that stack up day-to-day?

# Let‚Äôs break it down:

* **Hours Needed per Month:** 1,667
* **Days in a Month:** 30

1,667 hours √∑ 30 days ‚âà **55.6 hours of phone time per day**

Yes, you read that right. **55.6 hours. Per. Day.** To put that into perspective, there are only **24 hours in a day**! So, to meet this quota, Wes would need about **2.3 of himself**, cloned, roided, and on the phone nonstop.

# 3. What About Sleep, Wes?

Now, let‚Äôs say he tries to scale it back to a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù workday, like 8 hours. Even if he talks solidly for 8 hours every day, with zero breaks for food, coffee, or, you know, **breathing**, he‚Äôd only be able to handle about **240 calls a month**. That‚Äôs just **14%** of his supposed total. At that rate, he‚Äôs not even close to pulling $5 million.

# So‚Ä¶ Is This Realistic?

Unless Wes Watson is secretly triplets, each pulling double shifts on the phone, it‚Äôs safe to say that the logistics here just don‚Äôt add up. It‚Äôs like trying to sprint a marathon while juggling flaming leaf blowers ‚Äì it sounds cool, but it‚Äôs not really possible without some serious bending of time and space.",16,1730840403.0,WesWatson,15,0.94,False

Wondering if I could replace the bent tube part with a longer one.

I have just completed the TMB this past season (2 Sep ‚Äì 8 Sep). So I thought I should write something to document my memory and am hoping it may help the community for future excursions. Any questions please feel free to ask.

Some background context:

I am a 32M based in Sydney Australia. I work full time 9-5 office job (i.e., not one of those super athletes who can run the UTMB, at least not yet). I would say I‚Äôm reasonably fit and my ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù hikes are 20km ‚Äì 25km ish with 1000 ‚Äì 1500m elevation gain. Normally I can conquer these within 4 ‚Äì 6 hours (i.e., I normally hike at 3.5-6km/h if the terrain is not particularly tricky). I‚Äôm reasonably good with ascends but not so much with descends (especially sloppy/wet rocks)
After a few attempts, I realise I don‚Äôt like (or hate) backpacking. I want my backpack to be as light as possible so it took me a while to dial it down. My philosophy of doing the TMB is also taking as little as possible as long as it won‚Äôt put me in serious risk. Additionally, I have never done serious hikes for more than 2 days.

My wife and I were going to the Europe for 2 months (after all this is a 20-hour one way flight + connection time) and she‚Äôs not a hiker so I had to do this myself. As such, I want to finish this asap so that we can embark our journal sooner (including spending some time in Courmayeur afterwards). Initially I planned a 6-day TMB itinerary including 2x 30km back-to-back hikes (day 2 from Auberge de la Balme to Maison Vieille and day 3 Maison Vieille to La Peule). Later on, I thought it might just be easier that we visit Courmayeur while I was doing the TMB (so that she took the bus to Courmayeur). On this basis, I booked an additional day at Refugio Bertone so that my 3rd day will be split into 1x 10km day (from Maison Vieille to Refugio Bertone) and 1x 23km day. I booked all these in Nov 2023 (i.e., 10 months before my attempt)

In February, my wife also decided to do the Courmayeur to Les Houches section with me. I had to cancel my La Peule booking and replaced with a hotel in Ferret because La Peule was fully booked. The planning was largely based on Jeff Pelletier fast packing video (it was a 4.5-day itinerary, so I dialled it down by 15% per day, knowing that I‚Äôm nowhere as competent as they are). My goal was to do around 8-10 hours of hiking per day plus 1-2 hours of rest time so that I can start around 6am and finish around 3-4 pm.

I have also planned the following variants:

Col de Tricot
Col des Fours
Col Sapin (didn‚Äôt do it due to the weather)
Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette
Les Grands
Lac Blanc

Of all these, Col des Fours, Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette and Les Grands are the ‚Äúnon-negotiables‚Äù as they can greatly shave off the distance. Others are ‚Äúnice to haves‚Äù.


Thoughts (overall):

It was indeed very challenging, especially given the distance I have to cover per day and my fitness level. I was hoping to give myself a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù challenging but it was indeed more than what I was hoping for. It would have been much easier if I can shave off 5 km per day. Additionally, because there aren‚Äôt a lot of tall mountains in Sydney, I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience by doing say 1000m non-stop up or down hikes. Most continuous climbing in Sydney is around 100 ‚Äì 300m (with very few exceptions of 600m but these are not close by where I live). Total elevation gains/losses are somewhat ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù as climbing one 1200m mountain then going down is very different from climbing 6x 200m mountains. This is my biggest take-away and like everyone else said ‚Äì know your capabilities.

Be responsible and keep being responsible ‚Äì I made a few decisions that almost put myself in danger, so it is very important to not making stupid decisions (including at the planning phase too).

The terrain (especially the variants) is somewhat challenging as well (more challenging than I thought). I knew Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette is challenging so that is not a surprise. However, most variants are very rocky (especially with loose slippery rocks). This was not something I‚Äôm accustomed to, so my speed was way lower than I was hoping for (I was hoping for 3.5km/hr but I was mostly doing 2.5km-3km/hr).

I don‚Äôt like the huts at all. They are inevitable as I don‚Äôt want to carry my camping gears. However, the whole experience was not enjoyable. The sleeping condition was shit (people really snore), the food was shit (it is bundled and mostly vegetarian), they are not flexible at all (you have to have your meal at the scheduled time. I don‚Äôt normally eat dinner but I don‚Äôt have any other choice. I want to start early but some huts won‚Äôt provide early breakfast).


Thoughts (gears)

As you can tell, I have carried the bare minimums and it works fine.

The Wilit sunhoodie is not a comfortable hoodie but it is cheap and got the work done just fine.

Patagonia Torrentshell is a trusty rain jacket that kept my main body dry during a 10-hour thunderstorm (the sleeves were wet out. I don‚Äôt know if it is because the waterproofing is gone or it leaked through somewhere).

Merrell AP5 is wonderful ‚Äì stayed intact for the whole hike including all my later hikes in the Europe (it has 1700km hiking/walking distance before I retired it).
Decathlon MT500 pants is amazing. The only issue is the pocket ‚Äì it developed a hole prematurely (I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a coincidence as both of my pairs have the same problem).

I used my merino buff as a towel as well ‚Äì not great but it gets things done.

I used my alpha direct 90 as an insulation piece for after hike cool down period as well as a base layer when I washed my sunhoodie. It kept me warm very sufficiently.

The battery pack was an emergency item that I didn‚Äôt really use apart from day 2 at Courmayeur.

The water bladder was also an emergency item that I only used in day 2 and day 5.

My day to day itinerary

Day 1 ‚Äì Les Houches to Refuge de la Balme via Col de Tricot (via the high route) 5:30am ‚Äì 3pm, 26km


Les Houches to Bellevue (2 hours): I stayed in Rockypop the day before (after cheering for the last round of UTMB finishers). Left the hotel around 5:30am. I was hoping today to be an 8/9 hour day with lunch at Les Contamines.


My intention is to complete the whole TMB journey on feet, no shortcut whatsoever. I know people could take the cable car up to Bellevue but clearly this is not something I have in mind. The climb to Bellevue was fairly easy on dirt road.

Bellevue to Col de Tricot (2 hours): The variant to Col de Tricot was also ok ‚Äì some steep climbs but nothing crazy. Took me about 2 hours. Still on schedule.


Col de Tricot to Refuge de Miage (1.5 hours). The going down bit kind of made me to reset my expectation. As I mentioned earlier, it has a lot of lossy rocks and it was a non-stop descend of 600m elevation loss. Although I can always have the refuge de miage in view, it seems I can never reach there. It took me 1.5 hours to get there and I was somewhat exhausted. As such, I decided to take a short break and had some blueberry pie and ice cream.


Refuge de Miage to Les Contamines (1.5 hours). The remaining journey to Les Contamines was ok ‚Äì still some climbs and lossy rocks but much more manageable. Got there around 12:30pm ‚Äì slightly slower than my goal but acceptable. Because I had an earlier break and I was not hungry, so I decided to push on without any stop (most restaurants are closed anyway).


Les Contamines to Refuge de la Balme (2.5 hours).The climb to Refuge de la Balme was somewhat tough ‚Äì the terrain was ok but I was just exhausted (mentally and physically). It took me another 2 hours to finish the day (not including the flat road section in Les Contamines).


I had to say that I had a panic attack after day 1 ‚Äì on paper this should be the easiest day but I didn‚Äôt find it easy. With day 2 (the hardest day) coming up. I seriously don‚Äôt know if I am still capable of completing the TMB.


Day 2 ‚ÄìRefuge de la Balme to Courmayeur (via Col des Fours) 4:00am ‚Äì 6:30pm 35km


I didn‚Äôt bring my earplug which turns out to be a very stupid mistake. I thought I‚Äôm a deep sleeper so it was ok but NO IT IS FUCKING NOT. It was literally a snoring symphony at night and because I was still panicking about day 2, I realise I couldn‚Äôt sleep anymore around 3:30am so I decided to hit the road early. After some early breakfast (sourdough) and I started my day 2 around 4am.


Refuge de la Balme to Col des Fours (3 hours) The climb up to Col des Fours was surprisingly easy. With that being said, I did get lost once during the dark and wasted around 15min to get back on trail. The view at Col des Fours was somewhat disappointing though (weather was overcast). However, I took it not for the view, but to shorten the distance. I made it around 7am.


Col des Fours to La Ville des Glaciers (2 hours) From Col des Fours to La Ville des Glaciers was relatively easy ‚Äì it was long but not to steep. I made it around 9am. With that being said, I was clearly behind track (5 hours over 11km). At this stage I was still worried about my schedule with another 20km to cover.


La Ville des Glaciers to Col de la Seigne (2 hours) The climb to Col de la Seigne was ridiculously hard (mentally and physically). From a terrain perspective, it is very easy, but I‚Äôd say at that point (also I couldn‚Äôt rest properly the day before) it was such a torture to make to the top, especially that it took me 7 hours to the half way point of the day.


Col de la Seigne to Refugio Elizabetta (1 hour) Once I made to the top, the rest of journey to Refugio was surprisingly easy ‚Äì the descend was not steep, the trail was wide. I could even trail run most of it to make up for time. Now that I was back on track (it was 12pm and I only had 10km left), I took a much needed rest with some food to enjoy the view (people, if you can, book this refugio, it is literally the refugio with the best view).


Refugio Elizabetta to Refugio Combal (30min). I don‚Äôt know if my misconception or what, but the Italian section of TMB is much more easier than the French side. At this point I kind of picked up my confidence again and even did an extra loop at Lago del Miage. At this stage, I have made the decision that I want to press on to Courmayeur (instead of staying at Maison Vieille).

Refugio Combal to Maison Vieille (2.5 hours). This section is also very easy with magnificent views. As it was only 2pm when I left Refugio Combal, I was not rushing so that I could enjoy the views.


Maison Vieille to Courmayeur (2 hours). The descend was not that hard but it was pretty tough for me after 12 hours of hiking. I made to Courmayeur at a very slow speed‚Ä¶ Later, turns out this decision to make it to Courmayeur was a smart move because I only paid 1 euro for the refuge deposit but if we don‚Äôt stay in the hotel it will be 130 euros wasted (the tunnel was closed and bus cancelled without any notice). As such, I enjoyed the room myself and had a big proper breakfast the next day (hot bread, salami, sausage and other meaty stuff I really want to eat after 2 days of intense hiking).


Day 3 Courmayeur to Refugio Bertone


Nothing much to say for today ‚Äì wondered around Courmayeur in the morning and hiked up to Refugio Bertone.


Day 4 Refugio Bertone to Ferret via Promplo 5:30am to 4pm 24km


Just as I was building up my confidence level, a thunderstorm kind of demolished it. 10 hours of hike in non-stop rain was absolutely brutal. I really should have brought a pair of waterproof gloves or even some plastic bags to protect my hands.


Refugio Bertone to Refugio Walter Bonati (2.5 hours) This section was fairly easy so that I can keep my leisure pace. It was raining hard so I stopped for some coffee to warm me up.


Refugio Walter Bonatti to Refugio Elena (2 hours) This section was not hard either (although it was slippery particularly due to the rain). I decided to stop again to warm up with some coffee and pie.


Refugio Elena to Grand Col Ferret (1 hour) This was the hardest hour of the day ‚Äì hard wind and rain to make me a suffering day. Again, I was really hoping for some weather protection item to protect my hands.


Grand Col Ferret to Ferret via Promplo (4 hours) Apart from slushy mud, this section is not hard. However, I made another stupid mistake by going to Ferret via Promplo (which I believe was the old TMB route?). It was too slippery and too steep that I almost fell a few times, plus there was not much to see. It extended the time by quite a while.


Day 5 Ferret to Relais d‚ÄôArpette (8am ‚Äì 3pm 20km)


Nothing much to say for this day ‚Äì easiest day of the TMB. Enjoyed the sun a lot after a hard day. The only day I had a ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù breakfast in a mountain hut (it was a disappointing one though, just some bread and instant coffee).



Day 6 Relais d‚ÄôArpette to Auberge la Boerne via Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette and Les Grands (5:30am to 8pm, 23km)



My wife has been training for the TMB over the past year but it proved that it was not enough‚Ä¶


Relais d‚ÄôArpette to Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette (4 hours) It was clearly the toughest section of the entire TMB, in fact too tough for my wife. We were already 1.5 hours behind schedule at this point.


Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette to Chalet du Glacier (4 hours) The descend was not easier of course. Too many loose rocks. We were 3 hours behind schedule. With another 14km and 1300m elevation change to cover. I know that none of us would make it if we hike together. As such, my wife headed to Trient to catch public transport while I continued on.


Chalet du Glacier to Refuge du Col de Balme (3.5 hours). Turns out after Fenetre d‚ÄôArpette I was already very exhausted especially I was hiking at my wife‚Äôs speed and Les Grands had quite a few tricky sections (for me). It took me 3.5 hours to cover 7km which was probably a new low‚Ä¶ The view was spectacular though.


Refuge du Col de Balme to Refuge La Boerne (3 hours). After Les Grands I was finally back on the main TMB track. It was fairly easy to Aiguillette des Posettes before the final 700m descends. Definitely the toughest day but with the best view (especially around Aiguillette des Posettes when it was the golden hour).


Day 7 ‚Äì Refuge la Boerne to Les Houches via Lac Blanc (5:30am ‚Äì 5:30pm 25km)


After such an exhausting day, I don‚Äôt know if I should still go via Lac Blanc or not. Then I thought fuck it, I don‚Äôt know I will have another opportunity of visiting Lac Blanc in the future so I‚Äôd just do it.


Refuge la Boerne to Lac Blanc (2 hours) Knowing it will be a hard day with a final 1500m descend to wrap it up, I thought I should start slow and steady. The climb to Lac Blanc was ok with mostly easy terrain (there are some ladders but nothing crazy). I was hoping to buy some food/water at Refuge du Lac Blanc but they said they don‚Äôt serve people until 9am so I thought I‚Äôll just move on.


Lac Blanc to Flegere (1.5 hours) This is not hard although with some rocky downhills. I was hoping to get at least some water but the restaurant was closed. I was also shocked that there is no water refill point given this is a ‚Äútouristy‚Äù section.


Flegere to Brevent (1 hour) I was running out of water and per Google maps the restaurant at Brevent is open, except it is NOT. I was seriously debating if I should walk to Le Brevent without water, then I decided to do it knowing it could be a possibly stupid decision.


Brevent to Le Brevent (2 hours) The climb to Le Brevent was ok with some interesting terrain. I‚Äôd say it is enjoyable if the weather is good. Unfortunately it was raining so the view was less than ideal.


Le Brevent to Les Houches (4 hours) This was way slower than I was hoping for. The section before Refuge de Bellachat was ok and flat-ish. Things got worse afterwards. Because of the rain, the rocks are very slippery and I had to struggle with most of my feet placement (especially after 170km and 6 days, my legs were very exhausted). Thankfully, knowing it is the final stretch, I had the mental strength to finish it.",1,1730839366.0,hiking,0,1.0,False

Lighter : Yes, it's super helpful to start a conversation with anyone in your campus I started carrying a zippo lighter after my 1st year as many smokers don't usually carry a lighter I seriously don't know why, met sooo many people and talked to people I genuinely never would, it almost takes an average person 5-10 mins to smoke a cig and 15-20 if they're drinking chai/coffee, it seriously breaks the awkward silence and imo you don't have to smoke with them just to talk to them, many people starts smoking when they can just carry a lighter.  
  
Watch: It can be a cheap 10$ casio f-91 or a Patek Phillipe, usually buy something that mostly people don't use like a octagonal watch (tissot prx) or a square watch (like cartier tank there are cheap alternatives) that can attract other's but not in a flashy way that looks awful or cringe.

Last friday was our 10 year friendship anniversary. I did something prior that day for which I understand why she is upset with me.¬†

Lately (for the past couple years), there has been a constant pattern of her flaking last minute for a variety of reasons. Here is the thing: I tend to plan things like concerts and other events ahead of time because that should allow both of us to get prepared since I work (finished school a while ago) and she is at school and works on the campus. So, whenever we make plans to which she agrees with an enthusiastic yes, she would inform me that she won‚Äôt be able to attend within hours of our plans‚Äô start time. I would touch base with her to ensure we‚Äôre still good to go to whatever thing we‚Äôre going to. She usually says ‚Äúyes, we‚Äôre still good‚Äù before she flakes almost at the last minute. If she got sick, that‚Äôs absolutely not an issue to me because sickness can get you in the worst time and health is always the priority. Other reasons included like she was busy with school/work and doesn‚Äôt have money. I can understand but at the same time, it‚Äôs the result of bad time management. I am not considering them invalid nor I‚Äôm expecting her to dump everything to go with me but I would prefer to have a heads-up at least the day before the event. In case you‚Äôre wondering how often she does - for the past 2 years, I would roughly say that out of 10 occasions on which we make plans, she flaked on 6 of them. It‚Äôs becoming frustrating not because she canceled the plans. It‚Äôs because of the timing and she usually informs me in less than 12 hours. As I spent money on tickets, there were several times when I purchased tickets for both of us. If I was informed much earlier, not on the same day, I would have time to figure out how I can re-sell a ticket/get a refund/find a replacement person. The whole time I‚Äôve been friends with her, I didn‚Äôt complain about her flaking as I didn‚Äôt want to make her feel guilty/invalidated. However, there were times in between those flaking incidents when I saw her stories/posts of her going out with her friends. I didn‚Äôt complain about it either. I believe that I was being¬†



Here what happens next - We plan to go to the Oliver Tree concert. I buy the tickets for both of us, and she later reimburses me for her ticket. Several days before the concert day - I‚Äôm sending her the reminder of the concert and to confirm that we‚Äôre still good for that day to which she says yes. The day of the concert - I am asking her how we‚Äôre going to meet up and all, she said that she‚Äôll let me know after her doctor‚Äôs appointment. I followed up after that, and both of us found out that the concert was going to be from 1 am until 2:30am, even though the ticket said the doors open at 10 pm and wtf the concert starts so late. Then she started to have concerns about how we‚Äôll get home. I suggested to have Uber to which she says she can‚Äôt afford it, which was understandable. Subway would close at 2:30 am but the night buses still run. So, I personally thought that we can figure out on the way. Eventually, she says that she won‚Äôt go as she ain‚Äôt sure how she‚Äôll get home and it‚Äôll be super late and suggested to go with my boyfriend instead. I ended up leaving her message on read because I honestly was disappointed. Not on mainly on cancelling the event but on how easily she gave up on that instead of finding a solution. Subway will be closed once the concert is done but the night bus still run. Another option was going to my place with me by uber (wouldn‚Äôt mind the only one paying), sleep over and go home in the morning. I know her for ages and I can say that she is one of those types of people who often acts on impulse and quickly feels overwhelmed by even minor inconveniences. So, I got upset, drank a beer and fell asleep and ended up missing the concert. I was being silent for a couple days because idk how to explain this. I simply have the tendency to distance myself as I kind needed to cool down.She figured that I was being upset, and we ended up having a heated discussion about that.¬†



Some of the points included that:



I should be more compassionate and understanding as she had a bad doctor‚Äôs visit with not good results and ‚ÄúI told you I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was sure that I‚Äôd be able to come‚Äù (none of these was brought up on the day of the concert ahead of time)



Yesterday, we had an extensive discussion which included a lot of things, including each other‚Äôs personal problems. I tried to explain myself on how I simply wasn‚Äôt sure if our Halloween outing would even happen as she mentioned that she was looking for a job as she barely had money for rent and she won‚Äôt get her salary until November and OSAP until January. That made think ‚ÄúOh crap. Halloween outing won‚Äôt happen‚Äù. I agreed to plans with other people based on my assumptions/biases on her not being to attend and my uncertainty if she would be able to get along with the group due to the differences in interests. All of these didn‚Äôt seem like a justification. Yes, I should have followed up and all but I failed to do so as it felt uneasy, especially after the argument we had in which I ended up confessing that I already made plans with some other people.¬†

She was obviously pissed and again, we had that heated argument, then again:

I am not being sympathetic and compassionate



‚ÄúHow come did you include me in the group you‚Äôre going with¬†



‚Äú31st of October is the most important date and you didn‚Äôt consider me to spend it with me‚Äù (because I said that I was under the impression that we would do on the weekend before the Halloween as Halloween falls on thursday)



The argument had to happen the day before her graduation ceremony which I still ended up attending. After the ceremony, another friend joined who also made plans for Halloween. without including her as they ended up not finalizing the plans. I told her that she can join with the group I was going to or do something on the Halloween weekend. She didn‚Äôt say anything in regards to that, then it followed by an awkward silence for days.



Then, Halloween happens - I went out and I posted stories that I hid from her because I felt that she would feel hurt from seeing it. . She claims that I am not being understanding and sympathetic enough with her as she was having a rough year - she had to deal with school/prep for thesis, work, volunteering and other commitments and that I barely checked on her. Another claim that I kept refusing to hang out with her whenever she asked, and I wouldn‚Äôt agree to hang out with her as I‚Äôd be ‚Äútired‚Äù while she was working her ass off.



All those claims but she missed out the followin:



I went to her campus after work to hang out several times for the past year. On those visits, she would vent about what was going at school, with her ex and etc, and I listen.



There were times when she asked me to hang out after I finished work and I was already on the bus heading home (I live far from work and I spend 1.5 hr on commuting, excluding walking). I would join if I knew a bit sooner. Again, it‚Äôs not because I didn‚Äôt want, it was the timing.



Few times I said that I had errands to do/I was already half way home.¬†



One time in which I didn‚Äôt hang out cuz I‚Äôm tired. Here is the thing - One day, I spent half of the day her, then she suggested to go to some party to which her ex and his friend would join. Maybe I didn‚Äôt spend time unloading sacks of potatoes for hours but I honestly felt sleepy and tired around like 7 or 8 pm. I told her that I felt tired and maybe we can do it another day, and I‚Äôd usually need time to get prepared for nightclub outings. She didn‚Äôt want to accept no and she said that it can be fixed by going to her place to get ready and drink coffee so I feel more awake. I tried to convince her to do it another time while she insisted all excitedly that I‚Äôll be fine once I drink some espresso beforehand. She seemed too excited mainly because her ex was going to be there. I pretty much accepted the fate of going to the party with her despite me feeling tired, then she figured by my appearance that I wasn‚Äôt fired up to go there and let me go home.



I feel shitty about the whole thing I did with the Halloween outing and IG stories. Indeed, I fucked up everything. I know it‚Äôs not justifiable but there is a quite consistent pattern of flaking which makes me think ‚Äúis there a point of making plans when there‚Äôs like 30% chance that she‚Äôll join?‚Äù As I mentioned, in between, she would still go out with friends to which she claimed that those were old pictures. I‚Äôm having trouble believing that and this led me to having concerns like ‚Äúis she getting bored of me or what?‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think she flakes on others. I might be wrong but it‚Äôs quite possible.



However, for ages, I was patient, understanding and accommodating, and I was there for her when she needed it. One day, she asked to go to some festival with her because her ex broke up with her on that very day (and I wasn‚Äôt even aware of him until that day). So I headed out, took the bus to the subway station. As I arrived at the subway station, she asked me to meet her in her place. Here is the thing - I live in the far eastern part of Toronto and her place is in the north. I explained her that it would take me a solid 1.5 hr to get to her place, and I told her if it would take time for her to get from her ex‚Äôs place and to get ready, I don‚Äôt mind waiting even it‚Äôs going to be an hour. She said she needed me to come to her place. I didn‚Äôt object to this and I headed out to her place. While I was like 2 subway stops away from her, she messaged me asking if I ended up not coming. I told her ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm almost there. I got only 2 stops‚Äù. She apparently felt guilty about it and told me just to go to the festival thing with my boyfriend (and we didn‚Äôt go to it as he already had plans with his family and we won‚Äôt be able to make it). I figured that she needed time and space to process her emotions.¬† Even though I wasted time on coming to her place as she asked, I didn‚Äôt feel bothered as I knew she was distressed and emotional with how things ended up between her and that dude.



I didn‚Äôt complain a single time about her flaking until the recent incident as I thought that it was done. In the past she complained that we don‚Äôt go out as often as we used to. As we are both adults with different schedules, the best thing to do is to plan ahead of time which should allow both of us to get prepared or save up. I know life can be unpredictable and I can be understanding. I don‚Äôt hold grudges. If I did, I possibly would make plans and cancel them at the last minute as revenge. For a long time, not just with her, but with a lot of people, I keep my feelings to myself because they‚Äôre just temporary and I move on.¬†

1. Filter Coffee - Bun Butter Jam
2. Masala Chai - Egg Puffs

My justifications:

* The 'spice'-spicy Masala Chai would complement well with the 'Heat'-spicy Egg puffs and also with soft boiled egg filling inside and flaky, buttery outer covering.
* Disclaimer - The coffee should have less sugar than usual (aka slightly bitter). This way, the spongy and sweet flavour of the bun pairs up really well. And unpopular weird opinion ahead, but I like dipping the bun into the coffee. I feel like the way the butter melts gradually when coming in contact with the warm coffee, and it just mixes with the jam flavour and melts in the mouth as a whole, that feeling is awesome.

We got inspiration for what to see and do through, among other things, Reddit, so thanks for that!

We did not book a table for dinner friday and had a hard time getting a table on the first two restaurants. As we were hungry and desperate for food, we went to AZUMA for sushi. Very good quality sushi and super affordable! The waitress had our bottle of white wine in the fridge to keep it cold and was paying good attention to our table. 

Saturday we had a fantastic breakfast at Madame - Brunch & Coffee. Delicious coffee, great pancakes, super yougurt with homemade granola. Cozy place!

Saturday drinks at Kiosque des Bastions. Super charming place in the middle of a park. The service was so and so, but good drinks and cozy place.

Saturday dinner was in the old town at La Favola and that is truly a hidden gem! Feels like being in a time pocket. Small intimate italian restaurant. Great wines, fantastic tasty dishes, best limoncello we have ever had and great service. 

But we also had a shitty breakfast sunday. White rabbit brunch and co. Do not reccommend! Good ratings online but it did not live up to expectations! Horrible ""insta freindly"" decor. Boring coffee, horrible yougurt with dry oats, and 4 berries. 

And I will wrap it up‚ú®

While many people focus on the snow devils memory  with the fight with the gun fiend... denji's memory of snow is his trip to Hokkaido with aki and power. This was the last most familial memory he had with both Aki and Power the last moment he had with both of them.

Not only that but the erasure of the bitterness devil hangs with two specific moments and correlations. The bitter taste and memory from the barf kiss and the coffee shop that reze worked at. You could also interpret bitterness specifically as the feeling as well such as how Denji didn't feel human after himeno's death and what occured to her as well as reze not returning to the shop.

Now  what i'm specifically saying is that this is a main theme that chainsaw man might be about specifically. In everything awful that occurs in the world and our own lives, we have to make due with the awfulness and learn to live and understand it. You can see this with how pochita asks makima about a world without shitty movies.

In a way even with bad memories related to something such as a cat or a parent diying, you still have the memories of it that occured moments that changed and made you who you are. In a cosmic way this is similar to a theme similar to Fire punch: finding your will to live and understanding that even with everything awful that occurs it makes you keep going since you always find something new to aim for even if you're in an aimless direction.

","Hello everyone, I started collecting fragrances in May of this year, I have mostly bought these from the Talib, Anirudh, and Khanna brothers.

**Please tell me if there is something I can add based on the current collection and out of all these I would say SNOI is my favorite perfume.**

**If I have to rank the top 6 then it would be something like:-**

1. AFNAN SNOI:- It starts with a blast of bergamot and then when it settles down the okmoss takes over. I have received the most compliments for SNOI and even before entering my room, my friends could smell this, the projection and longevity are also great for at least 8 hours.

2. CDNIM Urban Elixir:- This is a shower gel perfume that I do like as this is my daily driver, the start is with an alcohol blast but as soon as it settles down it feels fresh for at least 6 hours and the projection is also great. I think Afnan Modest une and Urban Elixir are close but I have felt that Urban Elixir was much for spicy than Modest Une.

3. Hugo Man:- I like this and I can smell a lot of green Apples throughout the day. This is refreshing and the sharp green apple note is prominent throughout the day.

4. Afnan 9 PM:- Starts with a lot of bubblegum sweet notes and then it settles down and you can smell the vanilla. Sometimes it feels too sweet but overall it is a nice perfume and I can smell it on my shirts even after 3 to 4 days.

5:- OUD for Glory:- This starts with pineapple and is basically how a cake shop or bakery will smell, this is more feminine in my opinion but I do not mind as it is pleasing overall. I lent it out to a female friend and she requested me to order one for her. If you want to smell like a Cake go for it and it's not that heavy on wallet.

6:- Star Men:- Well I don't like this one and I believe I would spray this half an hour before going out because the initial projection is really bad like medicine but as soon as it settles down I can smell roasted coffee and tonka beans which is nice overall.

If anyone has any questions about the remaining ones that I left out you can let me know and I will try to write whatever I can relate to the smell too, all of these are blind-bought based on research and reviews from Reddit and YouTube.

I have already ordered 2 perfumes which are **Dumont Nitro Red(I bought this instead of Hawas based on the information that it is a better choice due to the reformulation of Hawas)** and **Hugo Man(Because I need something for the office and I do not want to finish my SNOI bottle so soon.)**

I know a girl at university and I think I really like her and I‚Äôd like to date her or at least to get to know her a little better. But I really don‚Äôt know how to go about it because I‚Äôm really socially awkward and I‚Äôve been single for like 4 years so I don‚Äôt really know a lot about dating. I‚Äôve managed to ask her to have a coffee with me and I thought it went well but now it has been like two weeks and I‚Äôm not so sure anymore. We still speak like casually at uni but she didn‚Äôt initiate another date so idk if I should just ask her again or if I should wait for her because then I will know that she would also like to go out. 
Sorry for rambling and I hope someone can hive me some advice <3",2,1730837538.0,bisexual,1,1.0,False

**1. early bird breakfast eaters**

we are ""coffee and a granola bar"" breakfast eaters. in-laws are biscuits/gravy/eggs/most-important-meal-of-the-day.

its hard. takes a bunch of time. So instead of going to the gym before work, my time is consumed by making breakfast everyday. which sucks. because i want to go to the gym.

by 8-9am, breakfast is ready... but thats a big compromise already since they are early 5-6am risers who are used to eating much earlier.

**2. next, lunch**

SO and I are ""fend for yourself"" during these lunch too. Make a PBJ, eat leftovers, snack. We cook ONE main meal a day (unless its the weekend). we are busy working, and after cooking out a breakfast, we gotta turn around and get everyone lunch fed.

**3. WFH noise**

more people, add an extra dog, add a toddler, and its a lot more noise naturally. not rude, just natural. TV going for the toddler, multiple people talking, in meetings, dogs go INSANE when there is a UPS truck.

harder to focus. harder to have meetings.

I also enjoy... peace...quiet...silence at times.

**4. entertainment**

keeping everyone entertained is hard. for these few days, I can't just ""turn off"".

**5. its dinner time now**

after getting people fed earlier in the day, the big meal is upon. pause on work again. figuring out WHAT to eat is hard enough with just us two people.

**6. hard to work late if need be**

on top of it all, if I need to work late -- im busier this time of year unfortunately -- its harder. on top of being behind from the day to being with. all the above, plus dealing with: *""its 5 o'clock why are you still working? close that laptop!""*

**7. cleaning up**

they aren't messy. but it is a lot to clean up afterwards.

naturally, we clean throughout the week, but that gets put on pause with guests. then you gotta catch up after the fact. **8. after the holiday, you can't go back home to your house and decompress** because you still have guests.

# TLDR

our in-law guests are easier than most in-laws I imagine... but its still draining to have people visit for 4-5 days straight.",8,1730837502.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,1.0,False

I've been told that this weight is average but I am still deeply unhappy with how I look, I have fat in the worst places. Stomach fat, huge lovehandles, etc.

I've been trying to lose that fat for some time now but I am not making progress. 

I can't control what I eat (I live with my parents, have no income, have no car or bike, next supermarket is 2 hours away on foot). I've resorted to just reducing my food intake.

My food intake today was one slice of bread and half a small boiled potato (no salt). I've had two cups of black coffee (no milk, no sugar), half a glass of orange juice and 2 litres of water.

Last week I only had water and black coffee for five days.

I am largely sedentary. My workout routine is: 60 crunches (2x), 60 pushups (2x), 2.30 minute plank (stretched arms) (2x) and a 1.5 hour walk. Since I have no money for equipment or gym memberships I am limited to my own body.

Still, I have cut out all calories for days, have done my little workout (if you can even call it that) every day during that time and haven't made any progress. I believe I'm even getting fatter. There's definitely no progress here.

I am desperate. What am I doing wrong. Why am I not losing any weight? Am I cursed by genetics?
