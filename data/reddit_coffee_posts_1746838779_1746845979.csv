I am 38 weeks and know nothing,"I went to my 38 week appointment today. I haven’t had (or been offered) a cervical check or membrane sweep. I had my first ultrasound today since 20 weeks to make sure baby wasn’t breech and for amniotic fluid. I had my blood pressure taken 4x because each time it was over 130, yet it was brushed off because I had a coffee with me (I’ve always had low blood pressure and drank coffee my whole pregnancy and this is the first time I’ve had anything over 115). Nothing discussed about labor/delivery or possibility of induction. Was just told “I’ll see you next week” after the ultrasound. 

What should I do at this point?? I’m semi-concerned for preeclampsia because of the blood pressure. And I really don’t even know what’s happening regarding impending birth. ",0,1746845862.0,BabyBumps,1,0.5,False
1kj0b3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HatMan/comments/1kj0b3w/my_experiences_with_the_hatman/,My experiences with the Hatman.,"I am over 50yo now. I have had hundreds of sleep paralysis episodes,  most of it was when I was young.  I had crazy episodes, some otherworldly and more intense than real life, as well as the normal bad/annoying ones too.

My Hatman experiences were only at my sister house in PA for about two years when I used to stay at their house while they were away in Vermont back in 1987 till 89ish.  I had seen him while having sleep paralysis there about 3 different times, but nowhere else ever again. It's been over 35 years and still the most palpable paranormal event that I have had.  I also had the most consecutive sleep paralysis episodes at that house as well. But they were the typical flavors of SP I normally get. 

 In these days before the internet, I used to talk to my mom about this figure that I called the Marlboro man shadow and other weird stuff in the house. Hatman experiences were very short , but always came along with that sinking stomach dread like feeling you get when you know he is there.   Although he didn't do anything, his presence was powerful on the end of some spectrum. Enough to wake me up in a panic, hence the short experiences.  I was blown away when I found out on the internet this man is actually a ""thing"" and the whole description is pretty much solid with all the people who encountered and through sleep paralysis.

I have traveled many places in the world and the only thing I can add here with Hatman and particularly with unique and powerful sleep paralysis episodes as a whole, is LOCATION.  I think where you are going to sleep influences sleep paralysis for one,  and the experience itself.  Not sure why, maybe its a person, something in that house past, preset or future. Or maybe the land in general. 

   At certain times when I was alone at my sisters house, a sudden strong presence would be felt randomly day or night. That feeling also comes along with the feeling that time stopped, and something has silenced when the room was already quiet. One time it was so disorienting to know 100% something was right next to you that you cannot see,  I ran out of that house in the middle of the night terrified to go back in. There was something else going on there and my family knew it too. The Hatman paired with something unsettling in that house is why I am convinced that sleep paralysis is more than a medical condition. It's also some unbridled gift/curse to be frozen between two worlds and be able to view them both at the same time.

The Hatman gone from my life when my sister sold the house. I will add, I drank a lot of coffee when I stayed there.  The most delicious coffee from that time period ""Gevalia"". I think that made the SP episodes more prevalent,  but that Hatman was because of something with that house imo.

  
I get sleep paralysis still but only a few times a year at best now. If you do not know this, when you see or feel there is a shadow or darkness that is pulling you in SP, you can have power over it if you are confident in your power and of who you are to make them go away. As far as reclaiming your movement,  I'm pretty good at snapping out of them.  It requires a ton of will power till your out. Try and find your pinky finger and wiggle it just a little to snap right back.

  
Advice: If you are still seeing the Hatman, Investigate your surroundings and the people who live there, if you come up with nothing, then start investigating the history behind whats around you.  He might not be there for you or because of you. I feel that his presence signifies something is very wrong (known or unknown) within the environment where you had the episode.",1,1746845744.0,HatMan,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1: The Spark of Adventure**  
The sun was high, and the air buzzed with excitement as the Pete family gathered in their cozy living room. Lenny (Dad), ever the laid-back adventurer, leaned back in his chair, his feet propped up on the coffee table. Mariya (Mom), nurturing and endlessly curious, was flipping through a travel guide with a mischievous glint in her eye. Roman (Older Brother), Pete’s best friend and sometimes rival, was half-draped over the couch, scrolling through something on his phone while humming a tune. Pete, the lively puggle, sat at Mariya’s feet, wagging his tail furiously as he listened to the conversation with wide-eyed interest.

“Hey, Mariya,” Lenny said, breaking the silence. “What do you think about Seba Skate Park? It’s supposed to have the best waves around.”

Mariya looked up, her golden-brown eyes sparkling with curiosity. “Seba Skate Park? That place is legendary! It’s not just a skate park—it’s an adventure waiting to happen. Think of it as a cross between surfing and rollerboarding. But Pete,” she added, bending down to ruffle his ears, “you’ve been pretty quiet. What do you think?”

Pete tilted his head, his short white fur gleaming in the sunlight. His big brown eyes darted between Lenny and Mariya, unsure if he was in on a joke or not. “Seba Skate Park? It’s… um… fun, I guess?” he said hesitantly, his tail giving a little pulse of excitement.

Roman snorted, still half-angled on the couch. “Seba Skate Park is epic. You’ll be surfing like a pro in no time, Pete. Just don’t fall off and get any weird seaweed stuck on your fur.”

“Hey,” Lenny said, trying to keep things light. “We’re all here to support you, whether you’re riding the waves or not. Speaking of which, have you been practicing? I don’t want any of you getting hurt out there.”

Mariya chuckled, standing up to grab her bag. “Don’t worry, Lenny. Pete’s a quick learner. Plus, we’ve got friends who can keep us safe.”

“Friends?” Roman said with a smirk, still scrolling. “I’m your brother, and I’m telling you, Pete, you’re going to need all the help you can get if you’re scared of the water.”

Pete’s ears perked up at the mention of being scared. “I’m not scared,” he said defensively, his tail sticking out like a flag. “Just… cautious, okay? I don’t like the feel of water on my paws. It’s… weird.”

Mariya knelt down again, her voice soft but steady. “You don’t have to like it, Pete. But you do have to try, right? The world is out there waiting for you to explore. And we’re all here to help you every step of the way.”

Pete looked at her, his expression a mix of hesitation and determination. “Okay,” he said finally, nodding. “But only because you guys are coming with me.”

The room erupted in laughter as Lenny stood up, slapping his hands together. “Alright, team! Let’s pack our bags, grab some snacks, and hit the road. Seba Skate Park here we come!”

**Chapter 2: The Journey Begins**  
The Pete family piled into their trusty van, filled with excitement and a hint of nervous energy. Lenny navigated the winding roads with ease, while Mariya sat in the backseat, humming along to the radio. Roman had taken the passenger seat, his feet hanging out the window as he called out directions to himself, probably lost in whatever was on his phone.

Pete sat in the middle of the backseat, his little paws resting on Lenny’s shoulder. The scent of salt and sea air wafted through the windows, mingling with the faint smell of sunscreen and anticipation. He kept glancing at Mariya, who had taken out a notebook and was sketching something—probably a map or a plan.

“Are you drawing that again?” Roman asked, craning his neck to see over the driver’s seat.

Mariya smirked, tucking the notebook behind her back. “Just some ideas,” she said vaguely. “You never know when inspiration will strike.”

Lenny glanced in the rearview mirror, catching Pete’s wide eyes. “You alright, buddy? Looks like you’ve got that nervous excitement thing down pat.”

Pete nodded, but his tail was wrapped around Lenny’s seat belt as tightly as possible. “I’m fine,” he said, though his voice trembled slightly.

 Mariya reached back to ruffle Pete’s ears. “You’ve got this, Pete. And don’t forget—we’re here for you every step of the way.”

Just then, they passed a sign that read “Seba Skate Park: 10 Miles Ahead.” Lenny whooped, and the van filled with cheers as everyone pumped up their excitement levels.

**Chapter 3: The Big Day**  
The Pete family arrived at Seba Skate Park just as the sun was beginning to set. The air was warm, the sand soft under their paws, and the smell of the ocean filled the air. Skaters of all kinds were already out on the boards, their movements graceful and dynamic against the backdrop of the golden sky.

Lenny led the way, carrying a big cooler filled with snacks and water bottles. Roman was muttering to himself, clearly plotting something, while Mariya was busy taking pictures of everything they saw. Pete stayed close to Lenny, his paws Alternately stepping on the sand and looking around with wide eyes.

“Alright,” Lenny said, setting down the cooler. “Pete, ready? You’ve got this.”

Pete looked up at him, his heart in his eyes. “I think… I think I’m ready,” he said hesitantly. “But what if I fall?”

Mariya crouched down beside him, her voice encouraging. “You might fall, Pete. But that’s okay. We’ll be right here to catch you.”

Roman, ever the pragmatist, was already pulling on his own board. “Don’t worry, little dude. If you fall, I’ll be there to pick you up—and probably make a funny about it.”

Pete’s tail gave a nervous wag as he nodded, taking a deep breath. “Alright,” he said finally, stepping forward with as much confidence as he could muster.

The board was bigger than he’d expected, but Lenny was right beside him, holding onto the cooler as if it were a lifeline. The waves rolled in, gentle at first, then stronger, pushing Pete and Lenny further out into the water.

“Okay,” Lenny shouted over the sound of the surf. “Stay steady! You’ve got this!”

Pete closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating on the feel of the board beneath his paws. Then, with a little yelp of excitement, he pushed off, gliding through the water with a combination of fear and joy.

**Chapter 4: The Thrill and the Fall**  
The first wave hit Pete full force, sending him surfing for a bit before he managed to right himself. He looked back at Lenny, who was grinning from ear to ear, clearly proud. Mariya was on the shore, cheering loudly with Roman, who was doing some sort of dance that could only be described as “brotherly.”

“You’re killing it!” Lenny shouted, but Pete couldn’t hear him over the roar of the waves and his own excited yelps.

For every small victory—every wave he managed to ride a bit longer—the fear crept back in. But each time, Pete pushed through it, determined not to let his fear hold him back. The board became an extension of his body, and with Lenny’s guidance, he started to feel more and more at ease.

“Pete!” Mariya called out, holding up a towel as if to signal victory. “You’re doing amazing!”

The sun was setting by the time Pete felt confident enough to try standing on the board. It wasn’t easy—he wobbled for a bit, but with Lenny’s support and some carefully timed encouragement from Roman, he managed to stay upright.

“Look at you!” Lenny said, his voice filled with pride as he snapped a photo of Pete standing tall on the board. “You’ve got it!”

Pete barked in response, a mix of excitement and disbelief. He couldn’t help but glance back at the shore, where Mariya and Roman were both clapping and cheering.

**Chapter 5: The Journey Home**  
By the time the sun had set and the stars began to appear, Pete was exhausted but exhilarated. He climbed back into the van, collapsing onto the seat with a satisfied sigh.

Lenny handed him a granola bar, his eyes twinkling with amusement. “You did good out there,” he said. “Real good.”

Pete took a big bite of the bar, then looked up at Mariya, who was already in the driver’s seat, apparently planning their next adventure. “This was… this was fun,” he said, his tail thumping against the van floor.

Mariya smiled over her shoulder. “We’re not done yet, buddy. Next time, you’ll be surfing like a pro.”

Roman leaned forward from the passenger seat, grabbing a bottle of water and taking a long drink. “You know,” he said, wiping his mouth with his hand, “I think I might want to try this again. Maybe without so much screaming.”

Lenny chuckled as he started the engine, pulling out onto the road. “We’ll see. But next time, you’re driving.”

Roman groaned, but there was a playful smile on his face. “You’d better not count on it,” he said.

As the van drove back towards their home, Pete leaned his head against Lenny’s shoulder, still buzzing with the day’s events. Mariya had taken out her notebook again, probably planning their next trip, while Roman was probably already thinking of ways to make their adventure even more exciting.

And in that moment, Pete knew he’d found something truly special—not just surfing, but the joy of facing fears and discovering strengths he never knew he had. Together, they were unstoppable.

I know I could walk more and be more active while WFH, but working from coffee shops sucks (loud, sometimes not sitting by an outlet, Wi-Fi can be spotty, have to lock everything down just to go to the restroom). I tried the coworking space thing a few years ago and it solved the practical issues, but it was still alienating working remotely in rooms full of people also locked-in working remotely  and it cost $350/mo. 

A jog a few times a week isn't cutting it. I have remained 15 pounds above a healthy weight for a year, 30 above my dream weight.

Dunno the exact pay cut because I only got a verbal offer today. The high end of the pay range would be my break even point, but no one offers the high end of the range. The low end would be a 25% pay cut.

And now she doesn’t offer to pay anymore… because she thinks I’m fine.

I did it to stop feeling like a charity case, but now I feel guilty. I miss her generosity, not because of the free stuff, but because it made me feel cared for. And now I wonder if I pushed her away with my pride.

1kj04pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kj04pc/aitah_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_girlfriend/,AITAH for being uncomfortable with my girlfriend constantly hanging out with her guy best friend and feeling like it’s starting to damage our relationship?,"I (26M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for just under a year. At first, everything felt easy — we got along well, shared the same humor, and talked about everything. But lately, one thing has been bothering me, and it’s starting to weigh on our relationship more than I expected.

She has a guy best friend who she’s been close with for a long time. I met him a few times — he’s friendly, polite, nothing overtly sketchy. They don’t cross obvious lines. It’s not like she’s staying over at his house or posting flirty selfies. But it’s the *subtle* stuff that’s making me uncomfortable.

They hang out fairly often — coffee here, helping him with errands there, casual movie nights “to catch up.” She doesn’t always mention it unless I specifically ask what her plans are, and even then it sometimes feels like an afterthought. They text a lot, and I’ve seen her smile at her phone and quickly turn the screen away when I walk by. It’s nothing explicitly incriminating… just enough to plant doubt.

What really bothers me is that when I try to talk about how it makes me feel — not accusing her, just expressing discomfort — she gets defensive immediately. She’ll say things like, *“You’re being paranoid,”* or *“He’s been in my life way longer than you have.”* One time, she even said, *“Only insecure guys get jealous over this stuff.”*

I’ve never asked her to stop talking to him. All I’ve wanted is a little more transparency and reassurance — maybe a conversation about what boundaries we both feel comfortable with. But instead of hearing me out, she flips it on me and makes me feel like I’m being irrational or needy.

The thing is, I don’t *want* to be the jealous boyfriend. But when someone seems emotionally closer to a “friend” than they are to their own partner, how am I supposed to ignore that? Lately, I feel like I can’t be fully honest with her without starting an argument. It’s caused me to pull back emotionally, and the distance between us is getting bigger.

I’m not accusing her of cheating. I’m not trying to control who she talks to. I just want my feelings to be heard and taken seriously. Right now, I feel more like a problem she has to manage than someone she actually wants to reassure.

So AITA for feeling uncomfortable with this friendship and for asking to have an open conversation about it? Have any of you dealt with something like this, and how did you handle it?",1,1746845120.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1kj004r,https://i.redd.it/yj8qars1avze1.png,Sipping Through the Storm: Drinks and Periodic Paralysis,"For those with periodic paralysis, every sip is a calculated decision. What we drink isn't just about quenching thirst—it's a daily balancing act between symptom relief and potential triggers that varies dramatically by PP type. The right fluids can be lifelines during attacks, while the wrong ones might steal tomorrow's mobility. Our mugs and water bottles hold more than liquid; they contain tiny doses of control in an unpredictable condition.  

The PP Type Matters  

Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HyperKPP) and Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HypoKPP) require nearly opposite approaches to fluids. HyperKPP warriors live in fear of potassium-rich orange juice or coconut water—innocent morning drinks that could trigger full-body paralysis. For them, glucose-laden Gatorade becomes attack prevention, the sugar helping drive potassium into cells. Yet for their HypoKPP counterparts, that same sports drink might be emergency medicine during an episode when potassium levels plummet dangerously low.  

Andersen-Tawil Syndrome adds another layer of complexity, where maintaining precise calcium and magnesium levels through carefully formulated drinks can mean the difference between stability and cardiac concerns. The same glass of milk that stabilizes one PP type might send another into unpredictable spasms.  

Morning Routines Tell the Story  

That first conscious decision—whether it's salt-loaded water for HypoKPP sufferers or diluted apple juice for HyperKPP patients—sets the metabolic tone for the day. Potassium-conscious HyperKPP veterans become expert label readers, knowing which ""healthy"" smoothie ingredients hide danger. HypoKPP warriors prep emergency banana-spiked shakes like paramedics readying crash carts. The kitchen transforms into a biochemical laboratory where we mix homemade electrolyte solutions with the precision of pharmacists.  

Social Minefields in Liquid Form  

The coffee shop outing becomes a tactical exercise—HyperKPP patients might tolerate careful sips of dark roast (caffeine can help lower potassium), while HypoKPP friends know one latte could leave them weak for hours. Alcohol presents near-universal danger across all PP types, its dehydrating effects and metabolic disruption making even ""just one drink"" potentially catastrophic. We develop elaborate polite deflections while secretly craving bars that offer electrolyte cocktails alongside margaritas.  

Attack Drinks: Emergency Medicine  

When weakness strikes, PP types reach for their specific arsenal:  
- HypoKPP: Rapid potassium delivery via oral solutions or coconut water  
- HyperKPP: Sugar-packed juices to drive down potassium levels  
- Andersen-Tawil: Balanced electrolyte mixes with careful calcium/magnesium ratios  

These aren't preferences—they're medical protocols written in sips. The exact temperature matters (lukewarm for better absorption during attacks), the straw thickness (wide enough for weak lips), even the cup weight (light enough for trembling hands).  

Finding Joy in the Limitations  
Yet within these strict parameters, small victories emerge. The herbal tea blend that soothes without side effects. The homemade frozen electrolyte popsicles perfect for bad days. The shared understanding when a fellow PP friend hands you your ""attack drink"" without being asked—these moments transform necessity into connection.  

We become masters of mindful drinking, finding pleasure in safe indulgences—perhaps two sacred swallows of that forbidden cola on a stable day, savored like vintage champagne. The lesson isn't about deprivation, but about discovering new favorites that love us back: mint-infused waters, carefully balanced smoothies, or tart cherry juice that helps without harming.  

""Precision hydration."" ""Adaptive enjoyment.""  

Our cups runneth over—not with unlimited choices, but with hard-won wisdom about what truly nourishes us. In a world that often misunderstands our relationship with liquids, we've learned this profound truth: every safe sip is a small act of rebellion against our condition, a declaration that even within limits, we can still taste life's sweetness.

The burger while not very filling, taste like 
real food because of the meat.

The set comes with a hot drink of your choice, I picked Americano. Coffee is good, slight hazelnut taste. No bitter or sourness, no need to add any sugar or creamer. Liked it better than Mc Donald's. 

Environment wise this is currently a pretty sweet spot to chill in the morning, it's newly opened so everything is looking fresh and it's a fairly big restaurant with not much people around due to it limited breakfast menu. If you are not eating this burger you are eating fried chicken 10am in the morning. No judgement though. 

Also this place gets noisy with just a bit of people despite its size, get your eargear if you don't enjoy people chatter

TLDR: Good place to eat/drink a bit of something and chill in the morning, the coffee makes the 4.90sgd set worth it.

I’ve had her for 1 month now

She has gone to puppy pre-school(3 classes so far) and currently doing her first obedience class 
She currently knows:
Name, touch, sit, down, paw, come, drop

She does amazing in public places and is really well-behaved in restaurants/stores. I currently have 2 issues with her 

She likes to pull towards people and dogs. She is beyond social so I’m starting to implement touch boundaries so she learns it’s NOT okay to invade other’s spaces. When she does this she just goes into love bomb mode and licks peoples faces and even pees a bit 😅 for dogs it’s similar and she wants to play with them 

Now the bigger issue is I’ve noticed some reactivity at home and in the car. 
At home she seems to have become more alert to sounds and people. For example, she has started to bark when someone walks to the door but becomes docile up close. She occasionally barks at people that pass by when in the front yard. On car rides, she has started to occasionally bark at people (99% of the time she is either sleeping, playing with her toy or enjoying a snack) 

I do want to add I live in a neighborhood where not many people pass by the house nor do I get many visitors so I’ve been struggling in coming up with scenarios to practice this 

Does anyone have any tips on how to address this before they become a bigger issue? 
To add I really want to emphasize how amazing she does out in public. She does get excited at time but I’m able to feel her in with a fancy treat and always reward her calm behavior 

Currently: 
On Saturday’s she is going to puppy pre-school that focuses on safe play & adds desensitization activities 
Mondays obedience classes 

I take her with me almost everywhere right now such as coffee shops, walks and even shopping. I’ve emphasized doing 2-5 outings a week with her right now so she is exposed to different people, dogs and cats ",2,1746844510.0,reactivedogs,0,1.0,False

On the other side of Santa Maria del Mar, you'll find Bubo, a pastry shop known for its creative and imaginative treats. Their fruit-loaded coulants and award-winning chocolate croissants are a must-try. Bubo's ingredients and operations meet high standards, but it's a bit pricier than other shops.

If you're looking for a more traditional bakery experience, head to Hoffman. This internationally known bakery is a popular destination for tourists and is located off Passeig del Born. They offer a variety of traditional baked goods that are sure to please.

For breakfast, Funky Bakers is the spot. Try their borek, house bun with cream cheese, and desserts like chocolate chip cookies and chocolate Swiss rolls. It's the perfect place to grab a quick bite before 10 am. 🥐👍

Last but not least, Jon Cake is famous for its cheesecake, developed by an aerospace engineer. While it's pricey, the cheesecake is worth trying. Consider ordering a whole cake online to skip the long lines. 🍰👌

And if you're a cinnamon roll enthusiast, Demasie is a bonus pick worth trying. They specialize in cinnamon rolls with unique twists that will satisfy your cravings.

When visiting these pastry shops, be prepared for crowds, especially at Brunells and Jon Cake. But trust us, it's worth it! 😊 The Born neighborhood is a must-visit for pastry lovers, and with these top 5 recommendations, you'll be well on your way to a sweet adventure.

1kizx01,https://www.reddit.com/r/nationalguard/comments/1kizx01/battalion_commander_hitting_on_me/,Battalion Commander hitting on me??,"So I’m a 20M PFC SMP Cadet in the National Guard. I’m not a lifer… I’m in and out of drill, check the boxes, and go back to the civilian side where I try to shine. I’m not doing ROTC next year but I’m finishing the semester out. I’ve built some cool things, worked with execs, networked with generals and tech leaders. I’m kind of a known name in certain circles, even if I keep a low profile in uniform. E-4s to O-5s in my field think I’m going places, but outside the Army, not in it.

Enter her.

She’s a new LTC. Sharp. Intense. Early-40s, single, no kids, with that kind of “command presence” that makes senior NCOs shut up mid-joke. But she’s also kind of… hot? In that I-read-defense-whitepapers-for-fun kind of way. First drill weekend she clocks me immediately. Like a hawk. Maybe my weird dot rank that’s not common? Maybe because we’re already connected on LinkedIn? Not in a hostile way… more like someone taking inventory of her next move.

At our post-drill social (yes, we sometimes have those), she makes a beeline for me near the coffee. Starts asking about my civilian/student work… very detailed questions. Turns out she “looked into me.” Compliments me on my “ambition beyond your rank.” I say thanks, try to keep it neutral. Then she leans in and says:

“I like soldiers who are going places. You should come by my office next drill, we could talk about some… opportunities.”

Okay. Definitely not just small talk.

Next drill, during some downtime, she finds me again. Very casually hands me a slip of paper with her personal number. Says, “If you’re ever up late thinking about the future… text me. I don’t sleep much either.” Then walks away.

Uh. Alright?

But it gets weirder.

My mom’s car broke down and I didn’t want to Uber, so I called my team leader to ask for a ride to drill. I was at my parent’s house instead of my dorm (no car on campus). I expected my TL. Instead, guess who pulls up?

Her.

She said she was “already in the area” (apparently lives near my folks). She’s in good looking civvies, in a nice SUV, wearing makeup, and even comes in to talk with my dad. She’s hot. They chat for 20 minutes. My dad, by the way, never wakes up before 10… except that day. Couldn’t make this up. She said something to him like, “He’s got a future ahead of him. Just needs the right doors opened.”

Then on the drive to drill, it’s quiet, then she drops this:

“You know… I’d like to know you better. You’re not like the others.”

I just nodded and stuttered. What the hell else do you say? Then she dropped this :

“Most people want to be led. You don’t. That’s… rare. Dangerous, too. But I like rare.”

Now, let’s be real: I’ve had mentors before. Real ones. Execs, professors, even the occasional O-7 and O-9 who took an interest in my work. But this? This has that energy. That “I can make you or break you” energy. Strategic. Maybe flirty. Definitely power-loaded. She hasn’t crossed the line… but she’s dancing on it in heels.

The problem is this: she’s connected. Not just inside our state’s Guard, nationally. If I ghost her, word will get around. If I play along too much? UCMJ, career suicide, and my entire civilian trajectory could go up in smoke.",1,1746844399.0,nationalguard,15,0.55,False

Any outside opinions will help me to figure things out. My circle over the past few years has become extremely small, so differing perspectives may help me a bit. 

I met my boyfriend about little over a year ago, and pretty much instantly, everything had clicked. We both became so in love with each other, and I felt in my heart that I met the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. He is very handsome, incredibly smart, and always knows how to make me laugh and put a smile on my face. Even to this day, he can just take one look at me and I still feel the butterflies I felt on the day we met. 

Having said this, he is a bit rough around the edges, is from Chicago and has bit of a mouth on him. He definitely is a little bit more introverted, likes the quiet and time solo. Thinks with his head and not his heart. Physical affection (hand holding, kissing, hugging), has never really been his strong suit. He has worked several factory jobs and others within that industry.

This is pretty much the opposite of how I am. I have been told that the soft skills (empathy, emotional intelligence, communication) are my strong suit. I also really do enjoy physical touch, kind words, and I could stay up all night and talk over a good cup of coffee. I care so much for the people in my life that I would do anything for them.

He is definitely left brain and I am right brain, and most of the time, I feel like it works well for us. Opposites attract and at times compliment very well. 

Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, let me now explain why I’m posting in the AlAnon subreddit: 

2 weeks after we met, my boyfriend let me know that he would be spending a week in jail coming up within a couple of days. This was due to time he needed to serve for a DWAI. He let me know that he refused to blow when he got pulled over because he was scared, but he only had a couple of beers and then drove home from going to the bar. The judge was very tough on him, as she had lost her daughter to a drunk driving accident and has zero tolerance for it. But he swore up and down that it was a couple of beers, and that this was really just a mistake. His record was clean before this one incident (I checked). 

After being released from jail, he had to wear an ankle monitor for 10 months. So for the majority of our relationship, he was absolutely clean and sober, and he seemed unaffected by it. He got off his ankle monitor in November 2024. 

As we have moved along, we started to talk about life plans together (moving in, running away and getting married,etc.) Things were really really good. 

In January of 2025, I started getting really sick, and soon found out that I was expecting. I was about 6 weeks pregnant when I found out and I told him. I was scared and shocked, but I was happy. 

Shortly after finding out, he started to drink. A couple of beers to take the edge off quickly became an entire fifth of cinnamon whisky every evening. At first, I understood it a bit. This was a stressful time for us and if I could have drank I may have indulged in a couple of glasses of wine or two. But when he started to heavily drink, the alarm bells were going off, and I began to worry extremely.

(For a bit more context, I have generalized anxiety disorder, so I worry about quite a bit constantly, and this didn’t really help. I also have alcoholism that runs in my family and just lost my uncle in September of last year to it. So hopefully that helps to paint the picture of where my mind was at during this time). 

At 8 1/2 weeks, I miscarried. Initially I felt kind of relieved, physically for sure because of how sick I was, but also mentally, because I was scared of how this was all going to play out. I watched my uncle drink himself to death in my grandparents house during his last months, and leave behind my aunt and my two younger cousins. I will never forget that funeral, and it kept replaying over and over in my mind. 

After I miscarried, my boyfriend’s drinking became worse and worse. The last few months have been me trying to somehow pull him out of it, texting, calling, having him stay with me, somehow trying to tell him that he can just walk away. But it was all unsuccessful, and most likely enabling. And as he turned to the bottle, I turned to work as a distraction. We were both grieving, but not properly, and separately. Even though we were together on most weekends.

A few weeks ago, I drove him to the hospital to get checked out. He had two seizures on my watch in my apartment in the middle of a bender. It has been rough, and definitely not something that I am equipped to manage at any level. 

Ever since then, his sobriety and our relationship has been shaky. I have become extremely depressed, and don’t feel like I can go to him because I don’t want to stress him out. He has told me “When you’re stressed out, it makes me stressed out, because you’re a part of me, and I love you.” 
And because of how shaky his sobriety is, I’m not sure if bringing my emotions to him brings him anything but harm. Sober or not, he definitely doesn’t do well with the intricacies of emotion. He is a simple guy, likes to go to work, and come home. 

And I like that about him. His simplicity often eases my mind and makes me feel safe. That’s part of the reason I fell in love with him. He’s always calm, cool, and collected. And when I’m on a rollercoaster of emotion, it tends to center me. 

But now, I’m just a mess and I feel all over the place. I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been told by others because we’re not married or have children, I can walk away from this situation and do better for myself. But I don’t want to do that, he is my best friend and his been a light in the storm for me. 

But he has become a bit distant from me in the wake of all of this. My suspicion is because his is still drinking, a lot and heavily. And he knows that it hurts me. Tonight he said he doesn’t want to come over because he’s really tired, but all I can think about is if it’s because he wants to drink instead. 

I’m not sure what to do, and I never thought that I would find myself in this position. And it hurts, so bad. In all of this, grieving my miscarriage has been very difficult to. I’m in therapy, and I am planning on attending an Al Anon meeting soon. 

Any thoughts will be helpful and welcome, thank you..
My timeline may be a bit off as well, it’s has been a whirlwind of a year so far, so I’ll be happy to answer any questions or fill in any gaps.

1kizl7i,https://youtu.be/ilRAhxM_g-g,3 True and Frightening Summer Crime Horror Stories,"**""The Summer That Stole Sylvia"":**

It was the summer of 1965, and Indianapolis felt like it was holding its breath under a heavy, sticky heat. I was 14, a gangly kid with sunburned cheeks and a bike I rode up and down East New York Street until the streetlights flickered on. Our neighborhood was alive with the sounds of kids shouting, sprinklers hissing, and radios blaring from open windows. Next door, Mrs. Baniszewski’s house was the place to be. She was a wiry woman with sharp cheekbones and a voice that could cut through a crowd. Her place was always packed—her own kids, plus strays like me, drawn by the chaos and the fact that she didn’t care if we snuck her cigarettes or sipped flat beer from cans she left in the fridge. It felt like freedom, like we were untouchable. Then Sylvia and Jenny Likens moved in, and that summer turned into something I’ll never shake.Sylvia was 16, with long, wavy hair that shimmered in the sunlight and a smile that made you feel like you were in on a secret. She had this way of tilting her head when she laughed, like she was savoring every second. Jenny, a year younger, was quieter, her steps uneven from an old injury that left her with a brace on one leg. Their parents were carnival workers, always on the road, and they’d paid Mrs. Baniszewski to watch the girls while they traveled. At first, it was like they’d always been part of our crew. We’d sprawl on the patchy grass in her backyard, spitting watermelon seeds into the dirt, or pile onto bikes and race to the park, Sylvia’s laughter trailing behind us. She’d tell us stories about the carnival—bright lights, cotton candy, and rides that made your stomach flip. I thought she was the coolest girl I’d ever met.But by mid-July, something shifted. I started noticing Sylvia looking worn out, like she hadn’t slept. One day, I saw her rubbing her arm, where a bruise bloomed like a dark flower under her sleeve. We were sitting on the Baniszewskis’ sagging porch, the air thick with the smell of cut grass and gasoline from a neighbor’s lawnmower. “Sylvia, what’s with your arm?” I asked, keeping my voice low so the other kids wouldn’t hear. She tugged her sleeve down fast, her fingers trembling. “Oh, you know me, always tripping over my own feet,” she said, forcing a smile. But her eyes darted toward the house, and I saw fear there, quick and sharp. I wanted to ask more, but Mrs. Baniszewski’s shadow passed by the screen door, and Sylvia clammed up.Things got bad fast. One sweltering afternoon in early August, I was in the Baniszewskis’ kitchen, the linoleum sticky under my sneakers. Sylvia was at the sink, scrubbing dishes in water so hot it turned her hands pink. The radio was playing some twangy song, and a couple of kids were sprawled on the floor, flipping through comics. Mrs. Baniszewski burst in, her face red and twisted. She held up an empty coffee can, the kind she stashed loose change in. “You little thief!” she screamed at Sylvia. “You took my money, didn’t you?” Sylvia dropped a plate, and it clattered into the sink. “I didn’t, Mrs. Baniszewski, I swear!” she said, her voice high and desperate. “Don’t lie to me!” Mrs. Baniszewski grabbed Sylvia’s hair, yanking her head back so hard I flinched. She dragged her to the living room and shoved her into a corner. “Stand there and don’t move. Not a word, you hear me?”Sylvia stood like a statue, her shoulders hunched, for hours. The other kids avoided looking at her, and I felt my stomach churn. I wanted to say something, but Mrs. Baniszewski was pacing, muttering, her eyes wild. She scared me—scared all of us. That night, I heard shouting through my bedroom window, and the next day, Sylvia wasn’t at breakfast. I found Jenny in the backyard, picking at a dandelion. “Where’s Sylvia?” I asked. Jenny’s face went pale. “Gertrude locked her in the basement,” she whispered. “Said she’s gotta learn her lesson.” I peeked through the basement window later, just a slit at ground level, and saw Sylvia sitting on the concrete floor, her knees pulled up, staring into the dark. I felt like I was choking.The basement became Sylvia’s world. Mrs. Baniszewski said Sylvia was “trouble,” and we were too afraid to question her. One day, she gathered us in the kitchen, the air heavy with sweat and cigarette smoke. Sylvia stood in the middle, her arms shaking as she held a bulky radio above her head. Her face was pale, sweat dripping down her temples. “If she drops it, you hit her,” Mrs. Baniszewski said, passing out belts to me, Ricky, and a couple of her own kids. Ricky, my best friend, leaned close, his voice barely a breath. “This is messed up, man.” But when Sylvia’s arms buckled and the radio dipped, Mrs. Baniszewski snapped, “Now!” I swung the belt, the leather cracking against Sylvia’s thighs. She gasped, tears streaming down her face, but we kept going, each hit making me hate myself more. Mrs. Baniszewski stood there, arms crossed, a sick smile on her lips. Sylvia’s cries followed me home that night, and I threw up in my bathroom, the taste of bile burning my throat.By September, the house felt like it was rotting from the inside. The summer heat hadn’t let up, but the laughter was gone. Sylvia was rarely upstairs, and when I saw her, she was a ghost of herself—skinny, with red burns dotting her arms and legs, her hair matted. I heard whispers from other kids that Mrs. Baniszewski had burned her with cigarettes, saying it was “discipline.” Worse, they said she’d taken a hot needle and carved “I am a prostitute” into Sylvia’s stomach. I couldn’t bring myself to look, but one day, I saw Sylvia limping across the hall, clutching her side, her face twisted in pain. Jenny wasn’t spared either, though it was never as bad. I caught her alone by the fence one evening, the sky streaked with pink. “Jenny, why’s Gertrude doing this?” I asked, my voice shaking. She wiped her eyes, her brace creaking as she shifted. “It started ‘cause she thought Sylvia stole. But now? It’s like she enjoys it. She makes us watch, says it’s to teach us.” Her voice broke. “I’m scared she’ll kill her.”I talked to Ricky that night, sitting on my front steps, the air buzzing with crickets. “We gotta do something,” I said, my fists clenched. “Sylvia’s dying in there.” Ricky’s face was tight, his eyes on the ground. “I know, but Gertrude’s unhinged. You saw what she did to Sylvia for talking back. What if she turns on us? Or our moms?” I wanted to be the hero, to march in and save Sylvia, but fear was a weight on my chest. One night, I saw Sylvia try to escape, her thin frame slipping through the back door. She was so weak she could barely stand, her bare feet catching on the grass. Mrs. Baniszewski caught her before she reached the street, dragging her back by the arm. The screams that night were different—raw, like something breaking. I hid under my covers, my heart pounding so hard I thought it’d burst.October came, and Sylvia vanished from sight. Mrs. Baniszewski said she was “sick,” but her voice was flat, like she was reading a script. The house smelled wrong, like damp and decay, and I couldn’t shake the dread crawling up my spine. I had to know. One afternoon, when Mrs. Baniszewski was at the store, I snuck in through the back door, my sneakers silent on the creaky floor. Upstairs, in a cramped bedroom, I found Sylvia on a mattress stained with God-knows-what. She was barely human—her body skeletal, skin covered in sores, bruises, and burns. Her face was swollen, one eye nearly shut, her lips cracked and bleeding. “Sylvia?” I whispered, my voice catching. She stirred, her eyes fluttering open. “Help… please,” she rasped, so faint I barely heard it. I stumbled back, my chest tight, and ran home.I grabbed the phone, my hands shaking so bad I dropped the receiver twice. “Police, you gotta come,” I stammered when they answered. “Sylvia Likens is at the Baniszewski house, and she’s hurt real bad. I think she’s dying.” They told me to stay put, but I went back, hiding across the street until the cops pulled up. They carried Sylvia out, her body limp, and I knew before they said it—she was gone. She died in the ambulance, too broken to hold on.The neighborhood exploded. Police swarmed the house, and Mrs. Baniszewski was arrested, along with some of her kids and a few others, even kids I’d played tag with. The trial was like peeling back the skin of our street, showing the ugliness underneath. Three months of torture—beatings, burns, starvation, all because of a woman who turned her hate into a game. I had to stand in court, my voice shaking as I admitted I’d hit Sylvia, too scared to say no. Mrs. Baniszewski got life, though I heard she got out later. The kids got less time, being young, but it didn’t feel like justice.That summer is a scar I carry. I see Sylvia’s smile in my dreams, hear her cries when it’s quiet. I was just a kid, but I should’ve been braver, done more. Evil isn’t always loud or obvious—it can be a neighbor’s house, a place you thought was safe. I tell Sylvia’s story now, my voice still shaky, because she deserves to be remembered. Maybe it’ll make someone else speak up, stop something before it’s too late. That summer broke me, but it made me promise to never look away again.

I’m Sean, and the summer of 1985 was my first as a police officer in Kansas City. I was 23, fresh from training, and the city was like a furnace, the heat so thick it clung to your skin. The streets pulsed with danger—sirens, shouts, and shadows that hid trouble. I was paired with Joe, a veteran cop with a weathered face and a voice like gravel. That summer was a string of moments so terrifying they still creep into my thoughts, waking me at night. This is my story, real as it gets, no ghosts or magic—just the raw fear of the job.It started on June 10, my first day. The air was heavy, like breathing through a wet cloth, and my new uniform was already damp with sweat. At the station, Joe sized me up, his eyes sharp under his cap. “Ready for the real world, kid?” he asked, his grin half-teasing, half-serious. I nodded, my stomach churning like I’d swallowed a stone. I’d trained for this, but nothing prepares you for the real thing.Our first call came before noon—a fight at a house on Elm Street. The place was crumbling, its white paint flaking like dead skin, one window boarded, another cracked. Angry voices spilled out, sharp and loud. A woman answered our knock, her cheek swollen purple, her eyes darting like a trapped animal’s. “He’s in there,” she whispered, pointing down a dim hallway. Her hands shook as she hugged herself. Joe led the way, his hand resting on his holster, his steps sure. I followed, my pulse hammering in my ears.In the living room, a man loomed, broad-shouldered and red-faced, clutching a beer bottle. The room smelled of stale smoke and spilled liquor. “Who called you?” he bellowed, stepping closer. Joe stayed calm, his voice low but firm. “Sir, let’s take this outside and talk.” The man laughed, a harsh, ugly sound, and tossed the bottle onto a stained couch. “You got no business here,” he spat, moving toward us. I tensed, my hand twitching toward my gun, but Joe didn’t blink. “Outside, now,” he said, sharp enough to cut. The man glared, his jaw tight, but he shuffled out. We cuffed him on the porch as he muttered complaints, his breath sour. The woman stood in the doorway, tears streaking her face. “You okay, ma’am?” I asked, my voice softer than I meant. She nodded, barely, her eyes on the ground. I felt unsteady, like the world had tilted. Joe clapped my shoulder. “First one’s always rough, Sean. You’ll get the hang of it.”A few weeks later, in mid-July, we got a call about gunshots on Oak Avenue. It was past midnight, the heat still oppressive, streetlights casting weak yellow pools on the pavement. The radio crackled: “Man down, 2300 block. Suspect fled.” We raced over, sirens wailing, the city a blur of dark buildings. On the sidewalk, a young man lay sprawled, his white shirt dark with blood, his hands clutching his side. His eyes were wide, glassy with panic, darting between me and the sky. “Help me,” he gasped, his voice thin, his fingers grabbing my sleeve. Blood smeared my hand, warm and sticky. “They ran… that way,” he said, pointing to a black alley. Joe scanned it, his flashlight cutting through the dark, but it was empty, just trash and shadows. “Hold on, man,” I said, pressing my hands to his wound, my voice shaking. “Help’s coming.” His grip weakened, his breaths shallow. The ambulance arrived, paramedics rushing in, but his terrified face burned into my mind. We searched the alley later, finding only a dropped shoe, no shooter. I kept seeing his eyes, like he knew he might not make it.Early August brought a call that still turns my stomach. A neighbor reported a foul smell from a house on Maple Street. The air was so thick it felt like wading through syrup, the sun baking the cracked pavement. The house was a wreck—sagging roof, windows boarded with warped plywood, weeds choking the yard. The smell hit us at the door, a wall of rot so strong my eyes watered. Joe grimaced, pulling his collar over his nose. “This is bad, kid,” he said, his voice muffled.Inside, the house was a maze of clutter—stacked newspapers, broken furniture, and sticky floors that crunched underfoot. The air was stale, mixed with that awful smell, growing stronger as we moved. Flies buzzed, thick and lazy. The basement door was ajar, a black gap swallowing the light. My flashlight trembled as we descended narrow, creaking stairs. At the bottom, rats exploded into motion, their claws scraping concrete, their bodies a writhing mass in the shadows. I gagged, my throat tight. In the corner, lit by my shaky beam, was a body—shrunken, decayed, impossible to identify. Maggots crawled over it, white and pulsing, like the corpse was alive with them. The smell was a physical thing, coating my tongue. I stumbled back, but Joe grabbed my arm. “Focus, Sean. Call it in.” My hands fumbled with the radio, my voice cracking as I reported it. Later, we learned it was an old man, dead for weeks, forgotten by the world. I still smell that basement in my nightmares, feel the rats’ eyes watching me.Mid-August, we chased two guys who hit a gas station on 7th Street. It was dusk, the sky a deep red, the air still hot. The radio buzzed: “Armed robbery, suspects fleeing.” We spotted them darting into an alley, two figures in dark hoodies. “Police! Stop!” Joe shouted, his voice echoing off brick walls. They kept running, footsteps pounding. I sprinted, my lungs burning, the world narrowing to the guy in front of me. I tackled him, hitting the ground hard, gravel biting my knees. “Get off me!” he yelled, twisting under me. I cuffed him, my hands shaking, adrenaline buzzing. As we hauled him to the car, I glanced across the street. A man stood there, lean and still, watching us. His smile was slow, cold, like he was memorizing my face. My skin crawled. I blinked, and he was gone, melted into the crowd. “You see that guy?” I asked Joe. He frowned. “What guy?” That smile haunted me, like a warning I couldn’t read.Late August, a woman called, sobbing about her brother. The house was small, its yard a jungle of tall grass, the paint chipped to gray. She met us at the door, her face streaked with tears. “He’s in the basement, tied up!” she cried, clutching my arm. We followed her to a door, the air turning damp and sour. The basement was a pit—dark, with a smell like wet earth and rot. My flashlight caught rats, dozens of them, scurrying over crates and pipes, their eyes glinting red. In the far corner, a man was bound to a chair, duct tape over his mouth, his face pale and sweaty. His eyes locked on mine, wide with terror. Joe cut the ropes, his knife flashing, while I stood guard, gun drawn, watching the stairs. “You’re okay now,” I told the man, my voice thin. He nodded, trembling, unable to speak. The woman’s ex had done it, she said, out of spite. We arrested him later, but the memory of those rats, their claws clicking, and the man’s helpless eyes stayed with me.In September, the heat still lingering, we got a call about a guy on a bridge over the river. It was night, the water below catching glints of city lights. He was young, maybe my age, standing on the edge, his shoulders hunched, tears shining on his cheeks. Joe hung back, but I stepped closer, my boots loud on the pavement. “I’m Sean,” I said, keeping my voice gentle. “What’s your name?”“Mike,” he said, his voice breaking, hands gripping the rail. “I can’t do this anymore.”“I hear you,” I said, my heart racing. “It’s heavy, I know. But you’re not alone. Tell me what’s going on.” His eyes met mine, raw and searching. I talked—about the humid night, my long shift, a diner I liked—anything to keep him there. For 20 minutes, I kept going, my voice steady even as my hands shook. Slowly, he stepped back, his shoulders sagging. Joe moved in, guiding him down, and we got him to a hospital. I felt a rush of relief, but also fear. What if I’d said the wrong thing? That moment stayed with me, fragile and heavy.By summer’s end, I was different. Tougher, maybe, but fear was a constant shadow, trailing me on every call. Joe saw it. “You held up, kid,” he said one day, tossing me a cold soda from a corner store. “But it don’t leave you.” He was right. Every dark alley, every sudden radio call, felt like it could be the end.That summer taught me fear isn’t just a gun or a chase—it’s the weight of what you see, the faces you can’t forget. I still hear the rats’ claws, see that man’s creepy smile, feel Mike’s despair. I’m telling you this like I’m sitting across from you, because it happened, and it’s part of me.





**""Eyes in the Vent"":**

It was the summer of 1995, and I was ten years old, sprawled on the living room floor of our small suburban house. The air was heavy, so thick with heat it felt like breathing syrup. My T-shirt stuck to my back, and the old oscillating fan in the corner just pushed warm air around, its hum blending with the distant chirp of crickets outside. The windows were wide open, sheer curtains fluttering lazily, letting in the faint smell of cut grass and barbecue from somewhere down the street. My little sister, Sarah, seven years old, was curled up on the couch, her blonde pigtails messy, clutching her favorite Barbie doll. She was half-asleep, her eyelids fluttering as the TV played a rerun of some cartoon about talking dogs.Mom and Dad were out at the neighbors’ barbecue, just a few houses down. They’d left me in charge for the first time, which made me feel grown-up but also a little scared. “You’re a big girl, Emily,” Mom had said, tucking a strand of my brown hair behind my ear. “We’ll be back by nine. Call Mrs. Larson next door if you need anything, okay?” Dad had handed me the cordless phone, pointing at the emergency numbers taped to the fridge. I nodded, trying to look confident, but as their car pulled out of the driveway, the house felt too big, too quiet.I tried to focus on the TV, the colorful characters yapping away, but my eyes kept wandering around the room. The living room was cozy, with a worn plaid couch, a coffee table covered in Sarah’s crayon drawings, and Mom’s collection of ceramic figurines on a shelf. Above me, in the ceiling, was a big metal vent, part of the air system that ran through the attic. It was old, its slats rusted, and sometimes it rattled when the air conditioning kicked on. But the AC was off tonight—too expensive to run all the time, Dad said—so the vent was silent. Or it should’ve been.Around 7:30, as the sky outside turned a deep orange, I heard a sound—a faint scratching, like fingernails dragging across wood. It came from the ceiling, right above the vent. I sat up, my heart giving a little jump. “Probably a squirrel,” I muttered to myself. We’d had one get into the attic last spring, and Dad had to set traps. I glanced at Sarah, who was still dozing, her Barbie slipping from her hand. The scratching came again, sharper, like something bigger than a squirrel shifting around. I stood, brushing my hands on my shorts, and stared at the vent, squinting to see into the dark slats.“Sarah,” I whispered, nudging her shoulder. She groaned, rubbing her eyes with a fist. “Wake up. Do you hear that?”She blinked, sitting up slowly. “Hear what?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.“That noise. It’s coming from the ceiling.”We both tilted our heads back, staring at the vent. The scratching stopped, and for a moment, the only sound was the fan’s steady whir and the cartoon dog barking on TV. I let out a breath, thinking maybe I’d imagined it. Then I saw something that turned my insides to ice. In the vent’s slats, where the dim light from the living room lamp barely reached, there was a glint—like eyes catching the glow. My breath caught, and I stepped closer, my bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. I climbed onto the coffee table, careful not to knock over Sarah’s juice cup, and peered up.That’s when I saw them: a pair of human eyes, wide and unblinking, staring straight down at me. They were bloodshot, set in a pale face half-hidden by shadows. My scream ripped through the room, loud and sharp, and I stumbled off the table, landing hard on my knees. Sarah woke fully, her eyes wide with panic. “Emily, what’s wrong? What’s wrong?” she cried, clutching her doll to her chest.“There’s someone in the ceiling!” I gasped, my voice shaking so bad I could barely get the words out. My heart was pounding, like it wanted to burst out of my chest. I grabbed Sarah’s hand, yanking her off the couch, and we ran to the kitchen, my socks sliding on the floor. The kitchen was open to the living room, no door to close, but it felt safer somehow, farther from that vent. I snatched the cordless phone from the counter, my hands trembling so much I fumbled the buttons, misdialing twice before getting 911.“911, what’s your emergency?” a woman’s voice answered, calm and steady.“There’s a man in our house!” I blurted, tears burning my eyes. “He’s in the ceiling, in the vent, watching us! Please, you have to help!”“Okay, sweetheart, stay calm,” the operator said. “What’s your name?”“Emily,” I said, my voice cracking. Sarah was pressed against me, sobbing into my side, her Barbie dangling by one leg.“Alright, Emily, where are you right now?”“In the kitchen. My sister’s with me. Our parents aren’t home.”“Do you know your address?”I rattled off our street name and house number, my mind racing. I kept glancing at the living room, at the vent, expecting to see those eyes again—or worse, a face pushing through. “He’s in the attic,” I added. “I saw his eyes through the vent.”“You’re doing great, Emily,” the operator said. “I’m sending police to your house right now. Can you stay where you are? Is there a door you can lock?”“No,” I said, my throat tight. “The kitchen’s open. There’s no door.”“That’s okay. Just stay on the phone with me. Are you and your sister safe where you are?”“I think so,” I whispered, but I didn’t feel safe. Sarah was shaking, her breath hitching. “Is he gonna get us?” she whimpered, her big blue eyes searching my face.“No,” I said, squeezing her hand, trying to sound sure. “The police are coming. We’re gonna be okay.” But my stomach was twisting, and I couldn’t stop picturing those eyes.“Emily,” the operator said, “can you still see the man? Is he still in the vent?”“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m not in the living room anymore. But I saw him. He was looking right at me.”Before the operator could reply, a new sound made my blood run cold—a low, raspy voice, coming from the direction of the vent. “Emily,” it said, slow and deliberate. “It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you.”I dropped the phone, a scream catching in my throat. Sarah wailed, and I pulled her down behind the kitchen counter, my heart hammering so loud I could hear it in my ears. The phone skidded across the floor, the operator’s voice faint now. “Emily? Emily, are you there?”“He knows my name,” I whispered, my whole body trembling. How did he know my name? Had he been listening to us? Watching us for days? The thought made my skin crawl, like bugs were skittering over me. I grabbed Sarah tighter, her sobs muffled against my shoulder. “Shh, Sarah, we have to be quiet,” I whispered.I reached for the phone, my fingers shaking as I pulled it back. “He’s talking to me,” I told the operator, my voice barely audible. “He said my name. He said he’s not gonna hurt me.”“Stay hidden, Emily,” the operator said, her voice still calm but firmer now. “The police are almost at your street. They’ll be there any minute. Just hold on.”Those minutes felt like years. Sarah and I crouched behind the counter, the linoleum cold against my legs. I kept waiting for the vent to creak open, for footsteps to thud above us, for that voice to call my name again. The cartoon was still playing in the living room, the cheerful music so out of place it made everything feel like a bad dream. I clutched the phone, listening to the operator’s steady voice. “You’re doing so well, Emily. The police are pulling up now. You’ll see their lights soon.”Finally, I heard sirens, faint at first, then louder, cutting through the summer night. Red and blue lights flashed through the kitchen window, painting the walls with color. There was a loud knock at the front door. “Police! Open the door!” a man’s voice shouted.I scrambled to my feet, dragging Sarah with me, and ran to the door. My hands were so sweaty I could barely turn the lock. When I swung the door open, two officers stood there, their flashlights bright in the dusk. One was tall with a thick mustache, his badge glinting. The other was shorter, with kind eyes and a gentle voice. “Hi, Emily,” the shorter one said. “I’m Officer Davis. This is Officer Thompson. Can you tell us what happened?”“There’s a man in the ceiling,” I said, pointing toward the living room. “In the vent. He was watching us. He knew my name.”Officer Davis nodded, his face serious. “Okay, you and your sister stay here with Officer Thompson. I’m going inside to check it out.” He pulled out his flashlight and stepped into the house, his radio crackling as he called for backup.Officer Thompson knelt down, his mustache twitching as he smiled at Sarah. “You girls are safe now, alright? We’re here.” Sarah nodded, still clutching her Barbie, but she didn’t stop shaking.We stood on the porch, the warm night air wrapping around us, as more police cars pulled up. Neighbors were starting to peek out, their silhouettes dark against porch lights. I heard shouting inside, then a loud thud, like something heavy hitting the floor. My stomach twisted, and I gripped Sarah’s hand tighter. A few minutes later, Officer Davis came out, wiping sweat from his forehead. “We got him,” he said. “You’re safe now, Emily.”They brought out a man in handcuffs, and the sight of him made my breath catch. He was skinny, almost skeletal, with matted hair and a scruffy beard. His clothes were filthy, stained with dirt and sweat, and his eyes darted around, avoiding us. He looked like he hadn’t eaten or slept in weeks. The officers led him to a police car, his hands cuffed behind his back, and I heard one of them say, “Found him in the attic, hiding in the insulation.”Officer Davis knelt in front of me, his voice soft. “He was living up there, Emily. Looks like he’s been in your attic a few days. You did the right thing calling us. You’re really brave.”“How did he know my name?” I asked, my voice small. The question had been burning in my mind, making my skin prickle.Officer Davis sighed, glancing at the police car. “He probably heard you and your sister talking. Maybe heard your parents call your name. We’ll find out more when we question him, okay? But he’s not coming back here.”Mom and Dad got home minutes later, their car screeching into the driveway. Mom’s face was white as she ran to us, dropping her purse on the grass. “Emily! Sarah!” she cried, pulling us into a hug so tight it hurt. “Oh my God, are you okay?” Her voice was shaking, and I felt her tears on my cheek.Dad was talking to the police, his hands clenched into fists. “How did he get in?” he kept asking, his voice loud. Officer Davis explained they found a loose board in the attic access, hidden behind some boxes in the garage. The man had been sneaking in and out, using our attic as a hideout.Later, they told us more. The man was homeless, moving between houses in our neighborhood, crawling into attics to sleep and steal food. In our house, they found a tattered sleeping bag, empty soup cans, and a few of Sarah’s missing hair ties stashed in a corner of the attic. He’d been watching us through the vents, listening to our conversations, learning our names. The police said he’d done this in other houses too, but we were the first to catch him.That summer changed everything. Mom and Dad installed new locks and a security system, and Dad nailed the attic access shut, swearing he’d never let anyone in again. They didn’t leave us alone at night for a long time after that. But even with the locks and alarms, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I stopped sitting in the living room, avoided looking at the ceiling. At night, I’d lie in bed, staring at the vent in my bedroom, wondering if I’d see eyes again.For months, I had nightmares—those bloodshot eyes staring from the dark, that raspy voice saying my name. I’d wake up screaming, and Mom would rush in, holding me until I calmed down. Even now, years later, a strange noise in the house makes my heart race, and I’m ten years old again, standing on that coffee table, staring into the vent on a sticky summer night, realizing someone was staring back.

Her birthday is in a few months and I'd like to get her a new machine. One key thing I am searching for is a machine with a **good steamer** as this is her biggest gripe with her current machine.

In my research I've come across the Gaggia Classic Pro as a common low cost option. However, I have also heard reports of it having temperature control issues and not having the best steamer. What is the truth with those concerns? I've heard that modifications like a PID can help with the temperature control issues. While I am open to doing mods on a machine for her, it's not something I'd want to invest in immediately. If possible I'd like to find a machine that I wouldn't have to modify right away. I've also come across the Breville Bambino Plus as another option. What is there to know about this machine? 

If there are any other machines that you would recommend, I would love to hear it! Thank you!

**TLDR**

Searching for an espresso machine for experienced partner.

Budget is $500.

A good steamer is a must.

1kiz83n,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1kiz83n/lawn_people/,Lawn People,"Whoever invented SNOOZE should win a version of the Nobel Peace Prize that rewards diabolical genius. After losing my battle with the alarm clock, I zombie-walk into the kitchen.

Caffeine. I need it.

The coffee machine groans to life. I take a sip, shuffle to the window, and stop mid-slurp.

There’s a crowd of strangers standing on my lawn. Just… standing there. Not moving. Not speaking.

One holds a sign:
Don’t be alarmed. We’re just waiting.

What the actual fuck?

I throw on shoes and go outside.

It’s like I have a beacon that attracts weird. Last week, someone mailed me a jar of teeth. No note.

Now there’s a full cult meeting on my lawn.

I take a step closer, consider spraying them with the hose.

Every head turns in unison. All eyes on me.

“Alright,” I say, “this has been fun and all, but…”

I stop. They all shift their heads upward. Slowly. Together.

“Hey,” I stammer, “can you all go do your weird… whatever this is… somewhere else?”

Nothing. Just eyes on the sky.

I sigh. My mother always said curiosity would get me in trouble. I glance up just to prove her wrong.

So, we stand there. Looking up. Saying nothing.

What am I doing?

I turn toward the shed to get the hose, but one of them is suddenly in front of me.

No sound. No footsteps. Just… there.

“No. It’s not time yet.”

I blink. “My lawn is not a sacred gathering place for your little ‘club.’ Leave. Now.”

“Soon,” they say in unison.

A woman in a polka-dotted raincoat steps forward. Her voice doesn’t match her face—too deep. Too many voices.

“We’re here for the convergence.”

I blink. “You’re here for the what?”

She points to the overgrown patch by the mailbox.
“This is the last known location.”

I look. Just a rock, a plastic fork, and clover.

“…Of what?” I ask, because I hate peace.

She doesn’t answer.

One guy pulls out a chair. Another, a cooler. Someone starts passing out sandwiches. A kid produces a kazoo from his sleeve.

“I’m going to lose my mind,” I whisper. I hope there’s beer in that cooler.

Just as I decide to scream, throw something, or both, a sound rumbles overhead. Not thunder. Something older.

Every head tilts exactly twelve degrees to the left. They point.
At me.

“You’re early,” they say in unison.

“You’re tres-pass-ing,” I snap.

The kazoo makes a sad, broken squeak.

They begin to pack up. The chairs vanish. The cooler disappears.

Then one voice:

“Do you see?”

Another:

“Do you see?”

It becomes a chant. A chorus.

“Do you see? Do you see? Do you see?”

The sky cracks open.
The world goes black.

The kazoo?
It keeps playing.",3,1746842135.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

But honestly I have very little raw pharmacology knowledge and also very little time and energy I can invest in it, so I don’t know where to start.

I am a student and want to enhance my studies, plus I suffer from a mild to moderate depression and anxiety depending on the day. I have lots of commitments and am very busy + am a diagnosed inattentive adhd and asd lvl 1. The thing I hate about stimulant adhd medication the most is that it takes the joy out of the world and makes everything hyper logical. Hard to interact with people when they don’t make 101% sense and can’t just laugh and joke around. 

I want to experiment with the stuff on ec in the way it’s meant to be taken too.

1kiz6n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kiz6n6/he_wears_my_voice_pt1/,He wears my voice. Pt1,"“Daniel, you’re okay.
You’re okay.
Please—you’re okay.
This isn’t you. Your thoughts aren’t you.
Happy place. Happy place.
Bagels. Sweet potatoes. Garden.”

“This dirty, useless waste of space. What a failure. He has everything handed to him and he still messes it up. Mom should’ve shoved him back up. He makes me sick. Less than human garbage. I should just—“

“No.
What am I thinking?”

“I know I fucked up, Daniel,” Angel said breaking me free from thought. He was scratching at his arm like he wanted to peel himself open. “It won’t happen again. I just… I really needed it this time. You don’t understand how hard it is.”

I didn’t respond. I wasn’t listening. I’d heard it all before.

This wasn’t the first relapse. It wouldn’t be the last. Everyone—especially me—was exhausted by his apologies.

“You need to go before Cindy gets home from school. I don’t want her seeing you like this. Go to Unc’s.”
I shut the door before he could say another word.

I stood there, still. Processing. I could feel him standing on the other side of the door, too, like his shadow had seeped through the wood. Waiting. Hoping.

Eventually, he left. I felt it like a chill lifting.

I’ve always had these thoughts. Sudden, violent things that crash into my brain like a car through glass. Things no normal person should think. Hate that doesn’t feel like it belongs to me…

Sometimes I wonder if they come from somewhere else. Either way they’re never pleasant, and it’s very draining. 

I went back to sit down amid the mess in the living room.  I looked at all the papers scattered about and the broken glass from my new wine cups laying near my coffee table. Red stains covering my new carpet. 

“Great. more work. I’ll have to get this cleaned up quick.” I thought to myself. 

Cindy would be home in less than an hour. Ever since her mom left us I’ve tried my very best to give her a normal life, something I never had. And it gets increasingly harder when things like this happen. 

An hour later Cindy got home, she walked in cheerfully. “Hey dad” she quipped as she threw her bag on the couch and slouched down. “ hey sweetie, how was your day” I asked trying to seem normal. 

“It was okay, but like soooo boring. I can’t stand this new teacher. He’s like a goof fr.” 

“What new teacher?” I inquired

“Mr Johnson, he’s replacing Ms Steven’s our math teacher.” She said

“What happened to her? “

“Idk, quit probably. She was really going through it with the divorce and all”

“That’s rough baby—what do you want for dinner? “ I asked straying the conversation away from soemthing heavy. 

“Chicken Alfredooooooo” she sang out with a grin. 

“Of course baby”  
I walked into the kitchen and started cooking. We had a peaceful dinner and went to bed without a hitch. 

The next morning before I could get ready for work I got a call from my uncle. 

“Daniel you need to get over here right now.” 
“What happe-“

“NOW. You need to come NOW” his voice cracked like something inside him had already broken.

He hung up and I rushed to my car to drive over since he only lived 3 minutes away. I didn’t know what to expect, but not this. definitely not this. 

Uncle Joe’s front door was cracked open when I arrived. 

I pushed it wide and stepped into chaos. Furniture overturned, a lamp shattered on the floor. Glass smothering the middle of the living room. There was blood—just a little—on the tile. A thin red smear on the wall. 

“Joe?” I called out.

A grunt answered from the back room.

I found him slumped in his recliner, pale, holding a dish towel to his side. Blood soaked through it.

“What the hell happened?” I rushed to him.

“Your damn brother,” he wheezed, half-laughing, half-wincing. “Came in screaming, tore up the place. I tried to calm him down. He shoved me. I lost my balance and fell into the glass table.”

“Where is he?” My fists clenched before I could stop them.

Joe motioned toward the garage. “Out there. Said he needed air. Or to scream. One of the two.”

I made it halfway across the living room when I heard the garage door creak open.

Angel stepped in, shirtless, breathing hard, sweat glistening off his face. His pupils were blown wide.

“Danny,” he smiled. “Man, I didn’t think you’d come.” He said as if he were greeting me at a bar. 

“You hurt Joe.” I shouted

“He’s fine,” he said. “He’s tougher than he looks. You’re mad, I get it. But this—this ain’t all my fault.”

“You always say that.” My eyes beaming through him. 

He paced a bit, ran a hand through his hair. “You know what’s crazy? I came here trying to get clean again. I thought maybe I could fix things. But then he started preaching at me. Talking about Cindy  and Jeffie like they’re some sort of angels. She’s not. He’s not. None of us are.”

“Don’t you dare bring up my daughter.” 

“I was just saying,” Angel shrugged. “She’s gonna find out what the world’s really like someday. I mean, you did. Remember what dad used to do when you cried? You remember, right?”

My stomach dropped.

Angel stepped closer. “I always figured you buried it. But I didn’t. I remembered everything. I just… handled it differently.” His breath stank of liquor and sin. 

I stared at him. “What are you talking about?”

“That neighbor’s kid when I was thirteen—Peter?” His voice was calm now, but slightly slurred. “I did to him what dad did to me. Only once. I swear. But… it felt like balance. You know? Like I got to put it somewhere. Like it wasn’t just us anymore.” 

The room turned to static.

“I always thought maybe you’d get it one day. That you’d break, like me. Then maybe we’d finally be brothers again.” He said unnervingly 

I took a step forward. He didn’t move.

“I should’ve left you in that bathroom years ago,” I said through gritted teeth.

Then from behind us: a cough, a weak gasp.

We turned. Uncle Joe was leaning forward in the recliner, clutching his chest, eyes wide in panic.

“Joe?” I rushed over, dropped to my knees. “Unc? Hey. Look at me.”

He opened his mouth but no sound came out. His lips were blue.

Angel stood behind me, frozen. “He was just talking ten minutes ago…” he croaked softly

I felt for a pulse. Nothing.

“Call 911!” I snapped.

But I already knew. His skin was cooling. His eyes were glassy.

He was gone.

And the moment my brain accepted it, the voice came back.
Clearer this time. Not like a thought.

More like… a soft whisper in my ear.

“I knew it , I knew it , I knew it. I should just get rid of him. Good for nothing trash. You deserve to suffer. You deserve what dad did to you.  Everywhere you go you ruin everything. You’re poison. Unclean filth. I can’t stand you. I hate you. I hate you so much. You remind me of dad. You deserve what I’m going—“

“Do you want to follow the ambulance to the hospital sir? “  an Officer asked me as I stood by in a trance watching EMT load my uncle’s body bag. 

“I..uh yes.” I replied 

“I’m sorry about your loss son. You could probably use these.” The officer said warmly as he handed me a pamphlet full of resources to help with the passing of a loved one. 

“Thank you.” I said emptily. Crumpling the pamphlet. 


The next few days were chaotic and melancholic all the same. Angel ran before the cops came, but they caught him the next day. They brought him in for questioning and then let him go from inconclusive evidence. Go figure, this is what passes as justice these days. I had to take over the arrangements for the funeral and informing the rest of the family about it. The funeral came and went as if it was just another day for everyone. I tried to stay grounded as my thoughts were running a thousand miles a minute. Cindy was what kept me from going insane. Her cute reassuring smile could disarm a crazed gunman. 

A week went by before I saw Angel again. By that time I sent Cindy to stay with her cousins for a while to get her mind off things. And I had already filed a restraining order against Angel. 

He looked at me with eyes that hadn’t seen sleep as he littered my doorway. “Can you buy me a -“
I shut the door in his face. I wasn’t in the mood for his bs. I felt his shadow lingering for over an hour after that. Even when I went back out to make sure he was gone. I still felt like he was here. After the second time I looked around I let that feeling dissolve and went on about my day. 

My therapist suggested I try meditation to help deal with the stress. I laid out a mat and sat down and started to meditate. I figured I’d try counting first to keep a steady focus.

What is th—

A long drawn out scratch at my living room window interrupted me. 
I wiped my eye as I glanced at it. Then I noticed my hand. Black liquid. All over my face.

 “What the hell?” 

I rushed to my bathroom and Washed it all off. It looked like a bit of it got into my right eye, I might have to go to the doctor. I leaned down to rinse my eye. When I got back up, I froze.

My reflection was grinning—I wasn’t . 
I checked my face with my hand. I definitely wasn’t. And my reflection hadn’t moved an inch. 

“What’s wrong Danny ? “
My reflection whispered, its eyes grew completely black and void. 

I just stared. Unable to move. Unable to speak and my lungs screaming. 

“It’s time Danny, you’ve waited too long
We’ve waited too long.
Do it. 
Do it Danny . “

he raised a long jagged blade and his grin grew more wicked. 

Thud. 

I opened my eyes. I was still in the living room. I got up quickly. I dropped the knife in my hand. 

Thud. Thud. Thud. 

I went to the door. Angel, once again. 
Before the door was fully open he began. “ hey man I really need help this time. I’ll go clean I promise.” Words I’ve heard one too many times before. 

“Do it Danny.
Do it 
    Do
  It”

“Please Daniel, I promise for real this time.” Angel pleaded to deaf ears. 


“Liar “
“Dancing with me”

So lost in thought I tuned Angel out. 
I smiled and said “alright man come on in.” 

Angel walked in. My grin widened. 

“He deserves it. You know. We know it. 
You’d be doing him a favor . He can’t live with himself. He’s weak. Too weak. “

Not even 5 minutes went by and Angel was snoring on the couch. 
Passed out from whatever drugs he was on. 

“Look at him. Pathetic. “

“He’ll never amount to anything. All he does is bring you trouble. Pain, and sorrow. That’s all he’s good for. “

I gripped the handle tight. I felt it pulsing, like it had a heartbeat of its own. 

“He’s a burden. A parasite . A roach”

My thoughts growing louder and louder in my head. Screaming. Begging to escape. 

“It’s his fault Danny. It’s all his fault. 
His fault Danny 
All his fault.”

The thoughts weren’t just in my head anymore. They were all around me. Inside the walls. Echoing in the vents. 

“All his fault”
“All his fault”
“ALL MY FAULT DANNY”
Angel shrieked suddenly. Sitting bolt upright, his eyes as black as void. 

The knife was stuck too deep by the time I realized what I was doing. 

Angel started laughing. Wet and guttural. Like the sound came from his stomach. 
“Hehehehehe….
Im so proud of you Danny.”
 
It wasn’t my brother’s voice anymore. Angel sounded like the voice in my head. The voice that’s haunted my thoughts and taken me to darkest corners of humanity. It was its voice. 


His mouth kept moving but the voice was booming from every direction. 

“Dannyy”
“Now I’m free—from you“

I stumbled back, crashing onto the cold hard floor, breath ragged. I was shirtless. 

Angel stood. Grinding his teeth. 

“I’ll see you soon”

and then sprinted straight through a window with inhuman speed. 

Glass exploded outward—but I didn’t hear it. 

Half a second later every mirror and window in the house shattered . They cracked like bones all at once. 

The whispers left my head that day, but the wind didn’t carry them far. ",3,1746842002.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I gave birth 3 months ago and have since lost almost 20kg. When I gave birth I was 95kg and now I’m sitting at 77kg. 
I’m on a big calorie deficit. As I don’t have time to go gym or anything. I do try to work out a bit at home in the morning and cleaning is also a workout I guess. 
My diet literally just consists of a black coffee in the morning and then “the lady shake” for lunch and that’s it. If I’m super starving then I get something small like a few grapes or some salami and cheese or something. Haven’t had bread in 3 months and trying to keep it that way. 
If I do have a cheat day or something comes up (like Easter did for example) I then take the extreme strength slim tea to essentially get it all out the next day on the toilet. 
I can’t get under 77kg I’ve been stuck on this for about a month. 
I talked to a lady at the health food shop yesterday and she mtnioned that my body is possibly in starvation mode and is storing / holding onto the fat. 

So my question is…
 1) how do I get myself out of this starvation mode without gaining weight back? 
2) how can I keep going?

The boy’s mother had told him to be patient with the old man. “He’s been through a lot,” she said, holding up his chin and brushing the hair from his eyes. “Just read slow-and be kind.” 
“Momma,  I know,” the young boy replied, rolling his eyes, “He’s probably just another one of them grumpy old guys who thinks he's better than everyone else.” He grabbed the old, worn-out book and shuffled out the door. 
“That kid’s got a lot to learn,” mumbled the mother as she cleaned the dusty, paint-chipped table.
Living by the sea, the boy had seen many extravagant houses, some of which had to cost millions of dollars, but as he arrived at the old man’s house, he was awestruck.
It looked like a castle. Not like the ones he had seen in the cheesy fairy tale books he used to read, but one he’d seen in one of his mother’s magazines. He faced a magnificent fountain, centered in a giant courtyard, the size of a soccer field he had played on once. Behind it rose stairs to the main entrance, flanked by two tall marble columns, and beyond them, the door, a large brown door with an angry-looking gargoyle set with a door knocker. At the top, the front door waited, dark as tree bark, with an angry-looking gargoyle clinging to the center like it was guarding the house. The boy swallowed. The book in his hand felt heavier now. He climbed the steps slowly, suddenly more afraid of the man behind the door than he cared to admit.

The boy knocked twice. Seconds later, the sound of tappy footsteps grew louder, his heart was now rapidly beating, making his face bright red. “Hello?” The door was answered by a tall, lengthy man wearing white gloves and an expensive-looking tuxedo. “Can I help you?” 
“Yes,” the boy replied, “I’m here to read to a. "" He shuffled to find his community service sheet, “Mr. Walters.” 
“Oh!” the man exclaimed, “He’s been waiting for you to arrive; he doesn’t get much company around here anymore.” The boy entered and immediately was chilled. The room was dark except for a window of light illuminating a few small tiles. 
“Excuse the mess,” the man said. Yet the room was empty, with no furniture, no stairs, and just a blanket on the floor scrunched in a pile. “Let me get that,” he went over and folded the blanket precisely, and laid it on the floor. “Right this way, please.” The boy followed the man through the halls of the unsettling mansion. On the walls, he noticed there were no family portraits, not even pretty paintings like the one of a flower that his mother had hanging in the kitchen. The boy was met with a feeling of darkness, it seemed to have crept into his heart, and his face was no longer red. The man led the boy to the dining room. Inside was a long, incredible table that was fit for a king. It was centered on the ceiling, and above was the greatest chandelier he’d ever seen. ‘It must have a million lights,’ he thought. At the end of the table, he saw the old man with a cane beside him. “May I get you two anything to drink?” the lengthy man asked. 
“Water, please,” the young boy replied.
“I’ll have a coffee, no cream or sugar.” The old man replied to the lengthy man, yet he glared into the boy’s eyes. 
“I will have that to you both immediately.” The lengthy man replied.

The butler returned, balancing a tray with two drinks. “Thank you,” the boy said politely. “I asked for it black,” the old man snapped, his face tightening. “I didn’t hire you just to screw up my coffee.” The butler stiffened, staring fearfully into the old man’s eyes. “I’m terribly sorry, sir. I’ll have it fixed at once.” The old man nodded, grimacing, and looked down at his hands. They shook subtly. On his right hand, a gold ring studded with bright diamonds; on his left, a pinky finger wrapped clumsily in a Band-Aid. “Nice to meet you, Mister…” the boy said, sticking out his hand. The old man didn’t look up. Instead, he muttered, “Are you going to read?” The boy swallowed hard and sank deeper into the cushioned chair. He opened the book, cleared his throat, and began, “A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green.” Before he could finish the sentence, the old man interrupted. “Now where is that damn butler?” Grabbing the armrest of his red-cushioned antique sofa, the old man pulled himself up with a groan. He cleared his throat and barked down the hall, “Where the hell is my coffee?” Tappy footsteps echoed louder and faster. The butler appeared, panting, swinging the door open. 
“Sir, I—”
“Just give me it!”
“Yes, sir.” The butler bowed slightly and handed it over. The boy watched, wide-eyed, his palms starting to sweat. He had never read to a man with such a temper before. 
“Well?” the old man snapped, now glaring at him. “What are you waiting for?”
“Sorry, Mister.” The boy fumbled through the pages to find his place again and continued, voice trembling at first, “Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world.” The old man turned his face toward the window, coffee cup in hand. Outside, the sky was brilliant and blue, the ocean stretched like glass, and a large cruise ship rested quietly on the horizon. The butler, broom in hand, quietly swept the old wooden floor. When he finished and left the room, silence settled thick and heavy between the boy and the old man, broken only by the boy’s soft, innocent voice, reading without a single stutter. The old man looked down into his coffee. He caught the reflection of the chandelier above—massive, glittering, priceless—and sipped. It was a fine coffee indeed, brewed with the world’s rarest beans, prepared with a gold-plated espresso machine fit for a king. Still, it tasted dull. Tasteless. Not because of the machine or the coffee, but because of something hollow deep inside of him. He stared back out the window.
“Crappy day out, isn’t it?” he muttered.
The boy stopped reading. “What?”
“The sun isn’t hot enough. I’m cold.”
“Mister, it’s nearly eighty degrees,” the boy said, wiping sweat from his forehead.
“Cold, isn’t it?” the old man repeated, voice low and faraway.
The boy laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke.
The old man didn’t laugh back.
The boy’s smile faded. He leaned back over his book and tried to pick up where he left off. But just as he read the first word, the old man spoke again. “Do you know why cruise ships skip deck thirteen? Because of superstition.” 
The boy went silent. He wasn’t sure what to say. His palms - now trembling - went back to turning the page. 
Suddenly, he felt the old man’s cold hand tightly grip his small, bony arm, and he stopped reading, “Mister,” his voice shaking, “Please let go of my arm.” 
“Let me tell you a story, boy,” the old man replied. “B-but, I thought I was s-s’posed to read to you.”
“Don’t be scared, boy, I won’t hurt ya.” he broke eye contact with the boy and stared out the window again, still holding a firm grip around the boy’s arm. 
The boy swallowed and rested back into his chair. “‘Bout what?” The boy asked. 
“About what I’ve been through,” the old man, still staring out the window, “About who I’ve become.” The young boy sniffled, and a small tear rolled slowly down his cheek. He began to speak, “I thought-,” but the old man quickly glared back at him and interrupted, “Ah! From now on, I do the talking and you do the listening.” The young boy slouched down and placed the book to the side. “Sit up, boy!” The old man exclaimed, “You kids these days have no manners.” The boy sprouted up. The old man let go of his arm and grabbed the armrest. “I was your age once,” he began, “I was just as immature, but you could always count on me having manners.” 

The sun was starting to set. The boy could tell because now a bright orange light was shining through one of the ceiling windows.
“Sets in the west, rises in the east,” the boy said.
The old man did not respond.
“Mister?” Again, no answer. “When will you tell me your story?”
The old man looked away from the window, back at the boy, and then out the window again, fidgeting with his fingers.
“I’m thinking.”
“’ Bout what?” the boy asked.
The old man didn’t reply.
“Don’t worry, Mister. I don’t care where you start. I’ll listen.”
The old man stopped fidgeting.
“I always loved a good story, and old folks are usually good at tellin’ ‘em.”
The boy was smiling now—no fear remained in his eyes. Yet somehow, the fear seemed to have shifted to the old man. His fingers twitched again, his tightly fitted collar now loose around his neck, and his right foot tapped slowly: up and down, up and down.
The old man opened his mouth to speak. “When—” But he stopped and shook his head.
The boy, still patiently waiting, rolled the old pages of his book with his thumb.
Then the old man started again.
“Have you ever been to London?”
“No,” the boy replied.
“Me neither.” The old man stared silently at his hands, dry and cracked. “How about Tokyo?”
“No,” the boy said again.
“Me neither.” The old man picked up his coffee, stirred it with a small steel spoon, and set it back down.
“Would you like to go to those places?”
“I guess?” the boy answered, confused.
“I would’ve. I’ve been to many places. Just… not those.”
“But, Mister, if you've been to so many places, why do you care about them so much?”
“I just want to see them,” the old man said, his lips starting to quiver.
“The only place I really care about is home. Those other places don’t really mean jack to me.”
“Well, you haven’t really traveled yet, haven’t felt the joy of seeing new places. Haven’t been… dissatisfied.” He chuckled dryly. “You’ll grow up. Don’t worry.”
“Yeah, I know. Momma’s always sayin’ somethin’ like that. She’s always sayin’, ‘Oh, you’ll grow up and eventually see all the things this beautiful world has to offer.’” The boy started laughing.
“Your mother sounds like a smart woman,” the old man said, seriously.
He grabbed his cane and stared out the window again.
“Yeah, she is,” the boy said, his laughter fading.
“Do you love your Momma, boy?” the old man asked quietly.
“Why yes, of course I do, Mister. With all my heart. And she tells me she loves me every day.” The boy answered like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
The old man slowly rose from his sofa and picked up an expensive-looking brown vase, intricately carved.
He studied it for a moment.
“You see this vase?” he asked. “It holds no true value.”
Suddenly, he dropped it.
The vase shattered into hundreds of pieces.
The boy stared, frozen.
A salty tear rolled down the old man’s cheek.
He picked up a lamp, “Money’s only material.” It fell and broke.
He was laughing now—wildly—as tears poured from his eyes.
“Mister, please stop!” the boy pleaded.
But the old man didn’t hear him.
He kept going—smashing, breaking, tearing—until nothing was left.
Shards of glass covered the priceless silk carpet.
Finally, the old man crawled into the corner of the room and sat, hands bloodied, cupping his face. He sobbed uncontrollably.
The boy could only watch in horror.
It was like watching a man fall apart in slow motion.
The door burst open.
The butler came barreling in.
“What in God’s holy name is going on in here!” he shouted.
Then he saw the old man crumpled in the corner.
“Sir!” The butler ran over and grasped the old man’s wrists. “Sir, are you okay?”
He lifted the old man’s hands away from his face, pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the blood.
Then the butler’s eyes snapped toward the boy.
“Did you do this to him? Did you?”
The boy backed away from his chair.
“No! I didn’t do anything, I swear!”
“You better not be lyin’ to me, son!”
“I’m not!”
The boy shut his eyes, plugged his ears, and started rocking back and forth.
‘Why’d you make me come here, Momma?
I don’t wanna be here. Please, please Momma.’
The boy opened his eyes and looked around the room. It was spotless.
The hundreds of tiny glass shards were gone, as if no one had ever stepped foot on the silky smooth carpet.
The vases, once obliterated, had been replaced with small statues — fierce lions carved out of stone.
But one picture still hung cracked on the wall.
It wasn’t even something he had tried to destroy.
A gold frame surrounded what looked like a family photo, but the boy couldn’t tell for sure.
He turned his eyes to the old man, who stared calmly out the window.
Red-stained bandages wrapped his hands like vines around two broken weapons.
The only sound in the room was the delicate tapping of his right leather shoe.
The cruise ship remained out on the sea.
“Hasn’t moved in a while,” the old man said quietly. “Wonder if they’ll stay the night.”
The boy stayed silent, still trying to comprehend what he had just witnessed.
The old people he usually read to would eventually fall asleep — that was his cue to leave.
“Sorry I lashed out like that,” the old man said, pulling his gaze from the window to his hands. “I have my episodes.”
No response.
Instead, the boy’s ears caught something else — a ticking clock, slow and rhythmic.
His leg started to bounce.
Each bounce fueled the urge to speak, but he stayed frozen in complete consternation.
“Hey, boy, are you gonna keep reading that book of yours?” the old man asked, voice light. “I was enjoying it.”
Still no answer.
“Son. I’m talking to you.”
“Sorry, Mister. I was just thinking ‘bout something.”
The boy opened his book and continued reading from where he left off.

The clock’s ticking grew heavier, like a slow drumbeat echoing through the boy’s chest. The book shook lightly in his hands, the words blurring, but he forced himself to keep reading: “A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who the guy is, long’s he’s with you. I tell ya, a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets sick.” The boy’s voice cracked. He lowered the book, his heart hammering. Across the room, the old man was watching him — not angry, not afraid—just waiting, as if he knew something the boy didn’t. The boy turned to the window. At first, he thought he had imagined it. But no, someone was standing at the shoreline. A figure, unmoving, axe in hand. Its face wasn’t a face at all, but a swirling canvas of blurred colors — pale, dark, golden, bruised — a thousand identities melted into one. Behind it, the sky had started to bleed. The blue sagged like watercolor running down a canvas, clouds tearing apart into brushstrokes. The cruise ship bobbed unsteadily, its once-perfect windows now hollow squares, its bow twisting sharply downward. The boy blinked hard. The figure was gone. The ticking quickened. It filled his head until he thought his skull might crack open. A hand closed softly around his arm — not tight this time, just enough to hold him still. The old man leaned close, his voice a low murmur:
“Son, I wish you had been wiser than I. I wish you had loved yourself enough to stay. I wish you had seen that you were always enough.”
The boy wrenched free.
“Get away from me!” he cried.
He rushed to the window. The figure was back — This time pointing. The boy followed its gesture. The sea split open. A monstrous black shape surged from the depths, devouring the cruise ship whole. Tiny passengers, barely more than flecks of paint, scrambled uselessly as the vessel vanished beneath the waves. The boy reached for them, but when he looked down, his own arm was unraveling into dust, blown away by a wind he couldn’t feel. He stumbled back and saw the room collapsing. The chandelier dissolved into drifting ash. The walls peeled back into fog. The floor cracked like thin ice, falling away into darkness. The old man, smiling faintly, sat calmly as his body faded into the air like smoke from a dying fire. The ticking slowed.
One beat.
A long pause.
Another.
Then — a final, booming tick.
Everything shattered. 
And the boy fell into silence.

The boy woke up. A cold drop of sweat slid down his forehead and onto his itchy cheeks. He looked around. The room was dark, except for a small lamp casting a pool of light on the table beside his bed. An IV tugged at his arm. He could feel the opening of a hospital gown at his back. On the table next to him, he found a remote and pressed the first button his fingers touched. A dim overhead light buzzed to life. He stretched his legs — they reached the end of the bed — but when he went to move them, they didn’t budge. Panicked, he hit his legs with his fists. No feeling. The heart monitor beside him quickened, its beeping rapid and frantic. His body flushed with heat. He lay back against the pillow, staring blankly at the ceiling light. Then the phone on the table started to ring. And ring. And ring. He ignored it. The ringing stopped, and a voicemail played. 
“Hey man, it's me again. I know I keep sending these, and you’re probably still asleep, but I’m gonna keep sending them just in case. Before the accident, you always seemed so dissatisfied. Whether it was work or money, or even your relationship with your wife, you always wanted more. And then what you did with my wife, honestly, dude, I hated you. And now it does come off as harsh, but frankly, it was true. I never wanted to fire you because we were always so close, and in my eyes, you weren’t just my brother, but my best friend in the whole world. And I’m sorry. I’m sorry if I ever made you feel as if you stood in my shadow throughout our childhood together,” the man speaking started to cry, “But you were always the most important, most incredible, and most inspirational person I could ever have in my life. I want you to know that, and I want you to know that you were always enough, not for me, not for Mom and Dad, but for yourself.” He stopped for a moment and sniffled, “Alright, well, I have to be going now, the old guy we always used to see at the bar is waiting for me. He’s actually not as weird as we thought; he’s honestly--” he paused, “--pretty interesting. Anyways, though, I’ll catch you later, man, bye.” 
The phone clicked.
A tear rolled down the boy’s cheek. The light overhead grew brighter and brighter, until the entire room was swallowed in blinding white. And then — darkness. He woke up again. This time, he was standing in the old backyard where he used to play as a child. The air was warm, but his body felt weightless, almost absent. Ahead of him, two young boys — versions of himself and his brother — were laughing and tossing a ball back and forth. He watched silently. After a few moments, the same blinding light appeared again, and darkness returned. Scene after scene played before him: Moments from his life, stitched together like fading photographs. Each memory showing two boys. Each one ending in the same consuming darkness. Until finally, the memories stopped. And darkness was all that remained.

The End.

Hey! I’m a 30-year-old guy in Michigan who’s ready to meet someone genuine. I’m someone who finds happiness in the simple things—quiet mornings with coffee, getting lost in a good book, cooking a new recipe, or spending time outdoors (hiking, walking trails, or just soaking in nature). I’m also a proud cat dad, so bonus points if you’re an animal lover too.

I value honesty, kindness, and a good sense of humor. I’m looking to meet a woman 30+ who’s emotionally mature and looking for a real connection. Long-distance is fine to start if we vibe—what matters is the connection.

Maybe it was removed? I was heavily criticized that my diet wouldn’t work and its not sustainable but the fact remains that it works and im not at all sick of it or feeling hungry basically ever.. and other then walking around at work Im not exercising. My plan is to lose 100 in a year and then begin hitting the gym and getting actively fit and im more motivated then ever to continue this.

So Im a 35 year old male just under 6 feet. I reached a shocking 331 pounds at a doctors appt on January 6th of this year. It immediately opened my eyes. The next day I begin a diet that has not changed in 4 months. Im feeling so much better and so proud of myself despite so many saying my plan wouldn’t work. So here’s what I’ve been doing.

Water and coffee is all I drink. Turkey sandwiches are my main meal. I’ll eat 3 of them in a sitting, twice daily with low-fat bread, lettuce and mustard. Occasionally changing turkey brands and toppings to change it up such as onions, tomatoes or jalapeños. Ive averaged each meal at about 450 calories (900 in total daily). The game changer is my snack. Fat free fudge bars. 70 calories a pop. Im addicted to these things and probably eat about 6-8 a day. (420-560 calories). Occasionally I’ll eat eggs, have salads with small amounts of fat free dressing and vegetables like corn and spinach and fruit like blueberries and apples to substitute things. Every 2 weeks i have a horrible meal like pizza and wings. This has resulted in losing an average of 12.5 pounds a month over the last 4 months. My average calorie intake is about 1500-1600 a day and im not starving myself. Didnt think it could be this easy. Any advice or good, filling low-fat foods would be welcomed. Preferably cheaper options as Im on a budget. I honestly didn’t think I’d be able to pull this off but it’s truly been so much easier than I could have ever expected as a food addict who eats his feelings. Nothing will stop me from fulfilling my goal and then crushing the goal I’ll make once Im completed with this. If I can do this then anybody can.",3,1746840943.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.8,False
1kiyv6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1kiyv6c/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1kiys2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/1kiys2v/horoscopes_for_the_scorpio_full_moon_on_may_12th/,"Horoscopes for the Scorpio Full Moon on May 12th, 2025 - All 12 Rising Signs","The horoscopes are written by looking at the impacts of the current astrological placements and how they affect your houses based on the Whole Sign House system. Though reading your sun and moon sign may offer some additional insight due to derivative astrology, reading your rising sign should give you the most clarity, validation, and/or insight. (The reference to the full moon energy lasts about a day. Most of the other energy last for about a week, unless otherwise stated.) 

**Aries Rising:** Okay Aries, you need to watch your money as well as your mouth when it comes to finances. The full moon will highlight your 8th house, so pay close attention to what you value, your shared resources, and most of all, your investments. Be cautious of overconfidence or overstating what you actually have. Be honest, especially with any financial advisor. And though you may be tempted to buy a round of drinks for all your friends, make sure your own expenses are covered first. I’m not saying there are financial problems, but there could be something unusual going on that you need to check into to make sure everything is copacetic.

Lately, you’ve been feeling a push-pull between having fun in your community and needing quiet time for spiritual reflection. The good news is that this phase is ending, and you’re likely to feel much more energized and ready to enjoy local festivities. Say yes to invitations, go to the farmers market, and get out into your neighborhood.

If you haven’t explored a new look for yourself, now might be the time. You could be changing your hair color, going for a dramatic cut, or reembracing a style you’ve never worn before. It’s almost as if your physical dreams are coming to life and you’re stepping into a version of yourself you’ve always wanted to embody.

You may be feeling creative and a little amorous. If you’re in a romantic relationship, you may spend more time reconnecting on a playful, physical level. If you're single, this could be a great time to meet someone. Be flirty and pay attention to who’s looking your way. With Mars in Leo in your fifth house, come up with a great icebreaker and ask something unexpected. It’s a fun and exciting time for you to date and express yourself.

Aside from romance, this is also a great time for creative pursuits, especially those tied to your appearance or anything you want to share with others.

Don’t be surprised if, during the full moon, something you’ve kept hidden from yourself is revealed. If not about you, it could be something about a family member—like finding out Uncle Joe dated your mom before marrying her sister. These little family stories may bubble to the surface. Whatever comes up is likely tied to a sense of possession, either of a person or property.

**Taurus Rising:** There may be a big reveal within your relationships. It could be as simple as someone confessing romantic feelings, or it may be your partner surprising you with a secret getaway. Whatever it is, there’s a strong chance it comes to light around the full moon.

However, when it comes to your relationships, be careful not to become overly fixated on making your point in a way that alienates someone you care about. Mercury square Pluto can also show up in your work environment. Yes, your boss may be difficult. Yes, the demands may be unrealistic. But this isn’t the time to butt heads, as your words could make things worse. Instead, take a step back and consider the bigger picture. Businesses are scrambling right now to adjust to changes in trade and economic pressure. Your perspective may be valid, but it may not fully address the deeper tension in the moment.

Lately, your dreams may have felt more vivid, as if they’re trying to tell you something. Pay attention to the symbols—you’re tapping into your higher self in your sleep.

You may feel newly inspired to take on home projects. If you’re not actively redecorating or renovating, you’ve likely been thinking about it. Now’s the time to put your ideas about beauty and comfort into your space.

That said, don’t overspend. The Saturn-Jupiter square can help curb excess but may also spark rebellious urges. With Jupiter in your second house, money has been coming in easily, but it’s going out just as fast. Repurposing or reusing things can help you stretch your income. Saturn encourages you to see the value in what you already have—it may just need a refresh rather than a replacement.

When all is said and done, spend time with those closest to you. Share your hopes and dreams, and let them see the parts of your soul you usually keep hidden. Let others witness the depth of your love and make the most of the Scorpio Full Moon.

**Gemini Rising:** The theme for you with this full moon is service. Who are you in service to? Is it yourself? Your work? Or something greater? This can be a powerful spiritual moment, and you may receive a deep insight about what it truly means to be human and live with purpose on this planet.

With Pluto adding tension and weight to Mercury, you could stumble upon your life path and gain clarity about the lessons you’re here to learn. The Scorpio full moon can be profound, helping you shift from passive observer to active participant.

Socially, you’re likely feeling drawn to connect. Whether it’s a local pub, coffee shop, or neighborhood event, you’re craving time with others. That passion for conversation and community may even lead you to support a cause, especially one focused on collective healing or lifting up marginalized voices.

Work has brought heavy responsibility over the past few years. Now, you may feel restless about your current role and start thinking seriously about a change. If you use this energy wisely, and take time to document your achievements from the last two years, you’ll be well-positioned to negotiate for a better position or salary. But timing and delivery are key.

Pluto’s square to Mercury suggests that your words could come off as too intense or overwhelming. Don’t undermine your progress by trying to make a point that others aren’t ready to hear. Play the long game. Schedule a one-on-one with your supervisor to go over your accomplishments and goals. Then, listen. Take in what’s said. Resist the urge to fill the silence. The feedback you receive now could help you make smart moves later.

As you move through your routines during this full moon, give yourself time to connect inward. Meditate, reflect, and allow messages from your higher self to surface. This is your chance to stop collecting information for the sake of it and start weaving it together into something meaningful. Once you see the deeper thread running through your experience, you’ll gain the clarity and momentum to move toward the life you want.



**Cancer Rising:** Where did your abundant creativity go? That might be the question circling your mind during this full moon. If I had to guess, you haven’t spent much time with friends lately. You’ve been so focused on your spiritual life that relaxing and letting loose hasn’t been part of the plan. But it’s time to reconnect. Yes, you’re busy, but being around people and sharing your ideas in real time, not just behind a keyboard, lifts your energy. It helps reignite the creative spark that fuels your soul.

Spiritually, you may be feeling restless. You’ve absorbed a lot of information over the past year, and now you’re wondering what to do with it. If you’ve been using your intuitive gifts to help others, you’re probably on the right path. But if you’ve been keeping those gifts to yourself, or avoiding conversations about what you’ve learned, you may be stuck in a feedback loop. Saturn is asking you to gain clarity and distill your experiences into something useful and lasting.

Your career may have taken a positive turn recently, and you could be in a role that feels aligned with your values. The work you’re doing is starting to pay off, even if you’ve had to make adjustments, especially if you're self-employed. Despite economic uncertainty, you’re seeing opportunities because you’ve stayed true to your principles.

It’s not just your values that are fueling your success, but also the skills you’ve honed over time. Your intuition is one of them, and it has real-world application, even in business. Quietly, you may also be engaging in collective spiritual work, like visualizing healing or lifting the planet’s vibration. Even if no one sees it, it still matters.

Just be mindful of your tone in conversations. If your communication leans toward “you should” instead of “you could,” it might turn people off. Not everyone is on the same page or moving at your pace. Speak from a grounded place, and avoid pushing too hard to be understood.

Let the full moon guide you out into the world. Say yes to an invitation, have some fun, laugh with others. Being present with people helps bring your creativity and joy back to the surface.



**Leo Rising:** Home is where your heart is, and this full moon lands right there. You may be feeling emotional about your family, your past, or childhood memories. Even if there’s tension with loved ones, this lunation can bring a fresh perspective. You may find yourself appreciating people’s uniqueness, even if you don’t fully agree with them.

Let yourself feel what might be missing in your personal life. This moon gives you the chance to see where emotional space needs to be filled, and how love and presence can help restore it.

It’s also a great time to shake off the weight of responsibilities and reconnect with joy. When was the last time you flirted, went out for a romantic meal, or did something spontaneous just for fun? Even if work and home life have been heavy, you still deserve to live in the moment. This full moon could inspire a getaway near water or warmer weather.

If you're single, plan something fun with friends. Yes, there might be tension within the group, but it likely stems from collective restlessness. You don’t have to go all out, either. Even if you prefer luxury, you can find middle ground, maybe glamping or sharing a nice rental with others. These friends have helped make recent years easier, and their presence can lift your spirits now.

Work has been a whirlwind over the past six years. Don’t let Pluto square Mercury pull you into unnecessary conflict. If you’re feeling reactive, hold off. Save difficult conversations until after the 21st. Right now, your insights may seem off-topic or be poorly received.

Use this full moon to reflect on the deeper threads connecting your home, family, partnerships, and work. How can you make your home a safe retreat while honoring the people you care about? Once you get clear on that, you’ll feel lighter and more focused on what truly matters.



**Virgo Rising:** This full moon might bring a surge of energy focused on your neighborhood or familiar routines. You may feel a pull to visit local spots you’ve been meaning to check out or revisit memories from your childhood. You could find yourself feeling sentimental, thinking about old friends, siblings, or the simple joys of the past. It’s as if you need to look back in order to move forward.

Your relationship with ancestry may have evolved over the last six years. While family ties remain strong, you’ve learned that your chosen soul tribe can be just as meaningful.

In your personal relationships, it’s time to step up. Your adaptable nature makes you easy to be around, but it can also stop you from taking emotional risks. If there’s someone you care about, make your feelings known. Just because you pick up on subtle cues doesn’t mean others do.

With Venus in your eighth house, this is a good time to deepen a close relationship. There could be a strong karmic element at play, a soul contract agreed upon long before this lifetime. You’re here to grow, and that means allowing yourself to be vulnerable. Don’t let ego get in the way.

In academic or cultural circles, speak your truth but resist the urge to push your ideas too hard. Even if your intentions are noble or your causes are just, people may not be ready to receive them all at once. Present your thoughts gradually. A more relaxed approach will help others warm up to what you have to say.

Work is still demanding, but in about a month, that intensity will start to ease. You’re feeling antsy and ready for a change. Just remember that your focus will shift toward friendships soon, so you’ll want to leave your current environment on good terms.

This full moon invites you to pause and reflect. Spend a quiet evening moongazing with a neighbor or roommate. Let the beauty of the sky remind you of the bigger picture and the importance of heartfelt connection.

**Libra Rising:** Hopefully by now, someone has reminded you how important your personal values are and how essential it is to spend time with the people you care about. This full moon wants you to focus on yourself. What makes you happy? What brings you joy?

If you’ve taken time off and stepped away from work, good for you. That will make this full moon feel lighter. If you actually turned off your phone and truly connected with friends and family, you’re likely starting to feel rejuvenated. This full moon reminds you that it’s the simple pleasures of life that bring the most peace, joy, and harmony.

Work should have slowed down a bit, so take this opportunity to rest. A month from now, Jupiter will move into your 10th house, launching a year-long period of career focus and growth. It's perfectly okay to take several breaks now. Pick up the phone or send a message to your friends; plan a party or casual get-together.

You’re also feeling more connected to your romantic partner. After all those eclipses, you're relieved to have weathered the storm and emerged with a stronger foundation. Things may feel dreamy right now, as that romantic spark returns. Even your platonic relationships feel softer and more enjoyable. Overall, you’re feeling grateful for the people in your life.

There is, however, one area that might need attention: contracts or finances. Review important documents carefully. You may need to have conversations about joint holdings or shared assets. If you’re stuck on hold for long periods, remember it’s not the fault of the person on the other end. This could be a good time to make a power move with your investments, but only after consulting with a professional.

You may also be feeling pressure around daily responsibilities. Hopefully, over the past few years, you’ve found ways to automate or delegate time-consuming tasks. If not, now is the time to simplify. Another busy cycle is approaching, and you’ll want to be prepared.

Spend this full moon soaking up the simple pleasures. Let this be your pause from the rat race.

**Scorpio Rising:** This full moon is all about you, Scorpio. It’s illuminating your identity, your needs, and your desires. Take the time to dig deep into your soul and ask yourself: What do you want? A relationship? A new look? A creative outlet? If your life isn’t fulfilling, this is the moment to look inward and claim that spark of personal enlightenment.

You’re being called to strike a balance between the old and the new. Look to the past to find the way forward. If you work in a creative field and feel uninspired, consider teaching what you’ve already mastered. You may discover new methods or insights in the process.

You may have had some lucky breaks involving shared resources, investments, or real estate. Still, there’s a restlessness that makes you feel like you should be doing more, or like more is expected of you.

You could also be experiencing a flirtation with someone at work, and the chemistry may be undeniable. But tread lightly. They may not be as available as they seem. Make sure they’re actually single. And if you’re already in a relationship, ask yourself if this is really a fire you want to play with. Let’s be honest, Scorpio, you’re drawn to danger. Just make sure it doesn't end up burning you.

There may also be tension in communication with a best friend or romantic partner. Don’t manipulate the conversation to come out looking like the good guy, or to cast the other person as the victim. If you want true intimacy, you have to drop the power plays. Your close relationships have already seen enough drama over the past six years. Don’t add fuel to the fire.

You know this about yourself: when you’re unfocused, you can be your own worst enemy. Let this full moon spotlight what needs to be transformed. It’s okay to prioritize your own needs.

**Sagittarius Rising:** This full moon pulls you into a dreamy, otherworldly space. Your intuition is heightened, and you may feel like you’re receiving guidance beyond the usual channels.

Your daily routine could be disrupted, and tasks may not go as planned. If you have young children in school, expect delays or last-minute assignments that throw your schedule off. If that happens, try not to take it out on teachers or administrators. Most school systems are dealing with budget cuts and curriculum stress. These issues are systemic, and it’s more effective to bring concerns to the school board than to individuals doing their best.

The good news is that you’re feeling especially creative. Fresh ideas are swirling around, and you have the energy to bring them to life. If you’re naturally creative, this could be a prolific week. Even if you’re not, you might feel the urge to add sparkle to your surroundings or your daily tasks.

In your romantic life, a bit of restlessness may arise. If you’re partnered, you might need to shake things up. If you’re single, channel that jittery energy into putting yourself out there. Attend a cultural event with friends or take a class in something that genuinely interests you. You never know who you’ll meet.

Overall, things are going well for you. This is a great time to take steps toward educational goals or reconnect with spiritual or religious communities.

Just don’t neglect the small things around the house. Take care of what needs your attention now, because if you don’t, it could snowball later.

**Capricorn Rising:** You’re in your feelings when it comes to your friends under this full moon. You may feel a wave of gratitude, especially toward those who have stayed close during the upheavals of the past six years.

Your mind is buzzing with creative thought, but be careful not to take credit for ideas that aren’t yours or manipulate situations for personal gain. Stay aligned with your values and let the energy move through you. And if you do get inspired by someone else's work, be sure to give credit where it’s due.

You might also be in the process of beautifying your home or creating your ideal living space. Stay open-minded; you may find unique items at thrift stores or estate sales that spark your imagination. Just because something was once a lamp doesn’t mean you have to use it that way. Repurposing can turn overlooked objects into treasures.

You’ve likely taken on a lot of projects lately, and that can make you feel restless. This energy can be productive or overwhelming depending on how you manage it. As long as you prioritize and don’t stretch yourself too thin, you can get a lot done. Just make sure you’re not burning the midnight oil every night on things that could wait until tomorrow.

Even though you prefer to do things your way, it would serve you well to get your partner or a friend involved. Yes, you may have more expertise, but you don’t have endless time. Collaboration could actually help things run more smoothly.

Just be mindful not to boss others around because it’s your idea or your home. Watch how you communicate and be genuinely appreciative of anyone who helps.

No project is worth sacrificing a friendship or someone’s dignity.



**Aquarius Rising:** This full moon lights up your 10th house of career. You may be wrapping up a major project or finally getting the recognition you deserve for your contributions.

The past six years have brought a lot of change on the home front, whether through moves, shifting family dynamics, or even your home's appearance. Now, your attention turns toward your values and how they shape your home life. It’s okay to acknowledge the stress you’ve been under and to tell the people in your life how much you appreciate and love them.

Just be sure your words are sincere. If you’re expressing appreciation, make it meaningful, not just a tactic to keep things running your way.

You may also be thinking about how to create change in your local environment, particularly around education or local government. This could be a great time to get involved or even consider running for a position.

Romantically, this week has the potential to reignite intimacy. The energy is supportive of bedroom connection, but make sure your partner knows it’s about more than just the physical side. Let them know how much they mean to you and that you see and value who they are. This isn’t just about your needs, mutuality matters.

Creatively, you may have hit a wall after a long streak of productivity. The energy is jittery, but you can channel it. Try thinking in fresh ways within tighter constraints. For example, if you’re a painter known for bright colors, try working in black and white. Even if you’re not in the arts, giving yourself a challenge within limits could open a new path of expression.



**Pisces Rising:** The Scorpio full moon lands in your ninth house, and don’t be surprised if departed loved ones leave subtle clues of their presence. Even if they don’t, you might find yourself reflecting on your ancestry and cultural roots, especially as they relate to current world events.

You may feel called to make changes in your life or take on new responsibilities, particularly those that involve helping others or supporting humanitarian causes in unique ways. Insight may come around the full moon, showing you how to make an impact in your community through unconventional channels.

Pay close attention to your dreams and intuitive nudges. They can be powerful and transformative. Just don’t rush to force one idea into reality without allowing it to fully develop. Your guides are showing you multiple paths to make change, not just for yourself, but also for underserved and unprotected groups.

All of this ties back to your core values. You won’t take action that compromises your autonomy. Instead, you’re being guided toward something that’s both meaningful and aligned. You understand that real strength comes from love, and that acting from the heart can be one of the most powerful things we do in uncertain times.

You may also feel restless at home, especially if you're facing a final identity shift about where and how you belong in the world. Do you want to be front and center, helping others through physical action? Or are you meant to raise the collective vibration through spiritual work? This full moon will illuminate which path fits you best and help you see how to remain true to yourself while continuing your work as a spiritual warrior.

Her house appeared fairly clean but once I startled cleaning it was clear things have been left and I’m not sure how to go about it. 

The house is 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, large sunroom, 2 living rooms, basement, and large kitchen. The basics she wants done every two weeks is both bathrooms, bed made up, all surfaces wiped like table, kitchen countertops, coffee tables, etc., and floors. This I can do in 4 hours, no problem. 

The extra things she wants done are windows/windowsills including the 15 massive windows in her sunroom, dusting everything (they have a lot of shelves), walls wiped, cabinets wiped, doors cleaned, and glass railing cleaned. After agreeing and doing the first clean I realized the basics are taking up the 4 hours. They are picky people and talked about how the last cleaner didn’t wipe the picture frames so they weren’t happy with them and fired them. I want to keep these clients as they are close to my house and are close to my other client that has the same day as them every 2 weeks so it’s a good day for me financially but feeling stressed about the amount of work.

The first clean I did I did the basics listed above, plus each bedroom window, dusting, countertops, some kitchen cabinet doors, floors, bathrooms, and making up her bed. There was a lot of cobwebs and a lot of dust and got probably 90% of it but really was running out of time and I didn’t even stop for a sip of water because I was trying to get it done.

I’ve been on and off the apps since then, going to social events and clubs, but nothing has come of it. I’ve had a lot of internal reflection about how to get into a relationship and there is one thing that might be holding me back; 

My ego. I’ve been told by a lot of people I’m pretty, I’m smart, I’m this and I’m that. I never had this type of attention when I was a teenager and I think it’s got to my head a little bit. I’m no Beauty Queen, but every time a guy has tried to approach me to show interest or even just to flirt with me I am disappointed in how unattractive they are.

Like, major props to them for having the courage to strike a conversation or ask for my number, especially in today’s world where those interactions are few and far between. I’m very shy by nature around people I find attractive/interesting so you would never catch me doing it.

But I just get so disappointed when the only guys taking that step are ones I don’t find the least bit attractive. I tried to open my options with someone from work who asked me out to coffee, but I didn’t find him very attractive but he was nice and we had a good time going out to coffee and just talking. I just couldn’t find anything about him physically attractive and I felt that he was better off being my coworker/friend. Besides, my previous relationship was someone from work and I gave him a chance that ended in disaster and awkwardness between mutual friends/coworkers and I’d rather not go through that again.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? I don’t believe in love at first sight, but I do think it’s important to at least be attracted to your partner beyond your intellectual interactions. I don’t want to date someone out of pity or because they are the only ones offering themselves to me. To be transparent, I don’t want someone who’s jaw dropping-ly gorgeous, I have a very average/above average taste in men. It just seems that none of them feel the same way about me (off the apps anyway/real life interactions).",1,1746840361.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

So I've been chatting with someone I met online. Conversation was normal at first - travel, hobbit houses (seriously), the usual. Then, naturally, we pivoted to crypto because OF COURSE.

We even talked on the phone a few times – three calls! Initially, they resisted, classic ""my sister is in the room!"" excuse. But I pushed, and eventually, they called. Sounded like a genuine girl, even sang me a couple of songs in Chinese. Seemed pretty real, honestly.

My gut was screaming ""SCAM"" at 95% volume when they started pushing this random ""decentralized exchange"" called ""highcoin.top"" (sounds legit, right? 😂). But I figured, hey, a $100 CAD investment is a cheap price for a life lesson in getting ripped off. So I sent my Benjamin to their sketchy platform.

Then ""Xin"" (the scammer, I'm 95% sure) starts ""guiding"" me through trades. ""Click this, click that, bullish, 60 seconds, set 30!"" I'm just blindly following along thinking ""Yup, this is where my $100 goes.""

BUT THEN.

Every trade hits. My balance on the fake platform goes UP. Xin is celebrating, talking about how much *they* made (50 thousand, naturally). The day after I made my initial small 'profits,' they started PUSHING for me to add $500, $1k, even $2k for the ""higher profits.""

This is where my inner cheapskate (and lingering 95% scam certainty) kicked in harder than ever. ""Uh, sorry, literally tapped out after that initial hundo. Working two jobs, no spare cash, can't even afford a decent clothes right now.""

They kept pushing, I made up an excuse about a friend needing help, and bailed from the chat for a bit.

Anyway, before I dipped, I actually *withdrew* the balance from the scam platform back to my legit one (minus a hilarious 15 USDC fee for the privilege).

Original investment: $100 CAD. Amount withdrawn: What started as 100 USDC turned into 171 USDC after the 'trades'. Conversion back to CAD (approx): \~$175 CAD.

Net profit from a suspected scam attempt: **$75 CAD.**

Xin is still messaging me, waiting for me to send more funds to ""make more profit, dear."" Meanwhile, I'm over here enjoying a coffee with my ill-gotten gains, slightly confused about how I ended up winning a small amount from a scenario designed for me to lose everything. (PS: i still have a date with her 2 days from now)

So yeah. Went looking for a life lesson in getting scammed, accidentally became the accidental scammer (of a scammer?). My weakness? Probably engaging as long as I did, and maybe getting them to sing. My strength? Apparently, making $75 from thin air and knowing when to bail.

Feeling 95% certain this was a scam, 100% certain I'm up $75 and slightly bewildered.

Anyone else accidentally profit from a scam attempt?",10,1746840345.0,CryptoScams,18,0.86,False

About: The regret of not appreciating what has been given to you in life
Themes: Finding Identity, Regret, Self-Reflection


Chapter 1:

The boy’s mother had told him to be patient with the old man. “He’s been through a lot,” she said, holding up his chin and brushing the hair from his eyes. “Just read slow-and be kind.” 
“Momma,  I know,” the young boy replied, rolling his eyes, “He’s probably just another one of them grumpy old guys who thinks he's better than everyone else.” He grabbed the old, worn-out book and shuffled out the door. 
“That kid’s got a lot to learn,” mumbled the mother as she cleaned the dusty, paint-chipped table.

Living by the sea, the boy had seen many extravagant houses, some of which had to cost millions of dollars, but as he arrived at the old man’s house, he was awestruck.
It looked like a castle. Not like the ones he had seen in the cheesy fairy tale books he used to read, but one he’d seen in one of his mother’s magazines. He faced a magnificent fountain, centered in a giant courtyard, the size of a soccer field he had played on once. Behind it rose stairs to the main entrance, flanked by two tall marble columns, and beyond them, the door, a large brown door with an angry-looking gargoyle set with a door knocker. At the top, the front door waited, dark as tree bark, with an angry-looking gargoyle clinging to the center like it was guarding the house. The boy swallowed. The book in his hand felt heavier now. He climbed the steps slowly, suddenly more afraid of the man behind the door than he cared to admit.








Chapter 2.

The boy knocked twice. Seconds later, the sound of tappy footsteps grew louder, his heart was now rapidly beating, making his face bright red. “Hello?” The door was answered by a tall, lengthy man wearing white gloves and an expensive-looking tuxedo. “Can I help you?” 
“Yes,” the boy replied, “I’m here to read to a. "" He shuffled to find his community service sheet, “Mr. Walters.” 
“Oh!” the man exclaimed, “He’s been waiting for you to arrive; he doesn’t get much company around here anymore.” The boy entered and immediately was chilled. The room was dark except for a window of light illuminating a few small tiles. 
“Excuse the mess,” the man said. Yet the room was empty, with no furniture, no stairs, and just a blanket on the floor scrunched in a pile. “Let me get that,” he went over and folded the blanket precisely, and laid it on the floor. “Right this way, please.” The boy followed the man through the halls of the unsettling mansion. On the walls, he noticed there were no family portraits, not even pretty paintings like the one of a flower that his mother had hanging in the kitchen. The boy was met with a feeling of darkness, it seemed to have crept into his heart, and his face was no longer red. The man led the boy to the dining room. Inside was a long, incredible table that was fit for a king. It was centered on the ceiling, and above was the greatest chandelier he’d ever seen. ‘It must have a million lights,’ he thought. At the end of the table, he saw the old man with a cane beside him. “May I get you two anything to drink?” the lengthy man asked. 
“Water, please,” the young boy replied.
“I’ll have a coffee, no cream or sugar.” The old man replied to the lengthy man, yet he glared into the boy’s eyes. 
“I will have that to you both immediately.” The lengthy man replied.



Chapter 3. 

The butler returned, balancing a tray with two drinks. “Thank you,” the boy said politely. “I asked for it black,” the old man snapped, his face tightening. “I didn’t hire you just to screw up my coffee.” The butler stiffened, staring fearfully into the old man’s eyes. “I’m terribly sorry, sir. I’ll have it fixed at once.” The old man nodded, grimacing, and looked down at his hands. They shook subtly. On his right hand, a gold ring studded with bright diamonds; on his left, a pinky finger wrapped clumsily in a Band-Aid. “Nice to meet you, Mister…” the boy said, sticking out his hand. The old man didn’t look up. Instead, he muttered, “Are you going to read?” The boy swallowed hard and sank deeper into the cushioned chair. He opened the book, cleared his throat, and began, “A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green.” Before he could finish the sentence, the old man interrupted. “Now where is that damn butler?” Grabbing the armrest of his red-cushioned antique sofa, the old man pulled himself up with a groan. He cleared his throat and barked down the hall, “Where the hell is my coffee?” Tappy footsteps echoed louder and faster. The butler appeared, panting, swinging the door open. 
“Sir, I—”
“Just give me it!”
“Yes, sir.” The butler bowed slightly and handed it over. The boy watched, wide-eyed, his palms starting to sweat. He had never read to a man with such a temper before. 
“Well?” the old man snapped, now glaring at him. “What are you waiting for?”
“Sorry, Mister.” The boy fumbled through the pages to find his place again and continued, voice trembling at first, “Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world.” The old man turned his face toward the window, coffee cup in hand. Outside, the sky was brilliant and blue, the ocean stretched like glass, and a large cruise ship rested quietly on the horizon. The butler, broom in hand, quietly swept the old wooden floor. When he finished and left the room, silence settled thick and heavy between the boy and the old man, broken only by the boy’s soft, innocent voice, reading without a single stutter. The old man looked down into his coffee. He caught the reflection of the chandelier above—massive, glittering, priceless—and sipped. It was a fine coffee indeed, brewed with the world’s rarest beans, prepared with a gold-plated espresso machine fit for a king. Still, it tasted dull. Tasteless. Not because of the machine or the coffee, but because of something hollow deep inside of him. He stared back out the window.
“Crappy day out, isn’t it?” he muttered.
The boy stopped reading. “What?”
“The sun isn’t hot enough. I’m cold.”
“Mister, it’s nearly eighty degrees,” the boy said, wiping sweat from his forehead.
“Cold, isn’t it?” the old man repeated, voice low and faraway.
The boy laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke.
The old man didn’t laugh back.
The boy’s smile faded. He leaned back over his book and tried to pick up where he left off. But just as he read the first word, the old man spoke again. “Do you know why cruise ships skip deck thirteen? Because of superstition.” 
The boy went silent. He wasn’t sure what to say. His palms - now trembling - went back to turning the page. 
Suddenly, he felt the old man’s cold hand tightly grip his small, bony arm, and he stopped reading, “Mister,” his voice shaking, “Please let go of my arm.” 
“Let me tell you a story, boy,” the old man replied. “B-but, I thought I was s-s’posed to read to you.”
“Don’t be scared, boy, I won’t hurt ya.” he broke eye contact with the boy and stared out the window again, still holding a firm grip around the boy’s arm. 
The boy swallowed and rested back into his chair. “‘Bout what?” The boy asked. 
“About what I’ve been through,” the old man, still staring out the window, “About who I’ve become.” The young boy sniffled, and a small tear rolled slowly down his cheek. He began to speak, “I thought-,” but the old man quickly glared back at him and interrupted, “Ah! From now on, I do the talking and you do the listening.” The young boy slouched down and placed the book to the side. “Sit up, boy!” The old man exclaimed, “You kids these days have no manners.” The boy sprouted up. The old man let go of his arm and grabbed the armrest. “I was your age once,” he began, “I was just as immature, but you could always count on me having manners.” 










Chapter 4. 
The sun was starting to set. The boy could tell because now a bright orange light was shining through one of the ceiling windows.
“Sets in the west, rises in the east,” the boy said.
The old man did not respond.
“Mister?” Again, no answer. “When will you tell me your story?”
The old man looked away from the window, back at the boy, and then out the window again, fidgeting with his fingers.
“I’m thinking.”
“’ Bout what?” the boy asked.
The old man didn’t reply.
“Don’t worry, Mister. I don’t care where you start. I’ll listen.”
The old man stopped fidgeting.
“I always loved a good story, and old folks are usually good at tellin’ ‘em.”
The boy was smiling now—no fear remained in his eyes. Yet somehow, the fear seemed to have shifted to the old man. His fingers twitched again, his tightly fitted collar now loose around his neck, and his right foot tapped slowly: up and down, up and down.
The old man opened his mouth to speak. “When—” But he stopped and shook his head.
The boy, still patiently waiting, rolled the old pages of his book with his thumb.
Then the old man started again.
“Have you ever been to London?”
“No,” the boy replied.
“Me neither.” The old man stared silently at his hands, dry and cracked. “How about Tokyo?”
“No,” the boy said again.
“Me neither.” The old man picked up his coffee, stirred it with a small steel spoon, and set it back down.
“Would you like to go to those places?”
“I guess?” the boy answered, confused.
“I would’ve. I’ve been to many places. Just… not those.”
“But, Mister, if you've been to so many places, why do you care about them so much?”
“I just want to see them,” the old man said, his lips starting to quiver.
“The only place I really care about is home. Those other places don’t really mean jack to me.”
“Well, you haven’t really traveled yet, haven’t felt the joy of seeing new places. Haven’t been… dissatisfied.” He chuckled dryly. “You’ll grow up. Don’t worry.”
“Yeah, I know. Momma’s always sayin’ somethin’ like that. She’s always sayin’, ‘Oh, you’ll grow up and eventually see all the things this beautiful world has to offer.’” The boy started laughing.
“Your mother sounds like a smart woman,” the old man said, seriously.
He grabbed his cane and stared out the window again.
“Yeah, she is,” the boy said, his laughter fading.
“Do you love your Momma, boy?” the old man asked quietly.
“Why yes, of course I do, Mister. With all my heart. And she tells me she loves me every day.” The boy answered like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
The old man slowly rose from his sofa and picked up an expensive-looking brown vase, intricately carved.
He studied it for a moment.
“You see this vase?” he asked. “It holds no true value.”
Suddenly, he dropped it.
The vase shattered into hundreds of pieces.
The boy stared, frozen.
A salty tear rolled down the old man’s cheek.
He picked up a lamp, “Money’s only material.” It fell and broke.
He was laughing now—wildly—as tears poured from his eyes.
“Mister, please stop!” the boy pleaded.
But the old man didn’t hear him.
He kept going—smashing, breaking, tearing—until nothing was left.
Shards of glass covered the priceless silk carpet.
Finally, the old man crawled into the corner of the room and sat, hands bloodied, cupping his face. He sobbed uncontrollably.
The boy could only watch in horror.
It was like watching a man fall apart in slow motion.
The door burst open.
The butler came barreling in.
“What in God’s holy name is going on in here!” he shouted.
Then he saw the old man crumpled in the corner.
“Sir!” The butler ran over and grasped the old man’s wrists. “Sir, are you okay?”
He lifted the old man’s hands away from his face, pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the blood.
Then the butler’s eyes snapped toward the boy.
“Did you do this to him? Did you?”
The boy backed away from his chair.
“No! I didn’t do anything, I swear!”
“You better not be lyin’ to me, son!”
“I’m not!”
The boy shut his eyes, plugged his ears, and started rocking back and forth.
Why’d you make me come here, Momma?
I don’t wanna be here. Please, please, Momma.

















Chapter 5:
The boy opened his eyes and looked around the room. It was spotless.
The hundreds of tiny glass shards were gone, as if no one had ever stepped foot on the silky smooth carpet.
The vases, once obliterated, had been replaced with small statues — fierce lions carved out of stone.
But one picture still hung cracked on the wall.
It wasn’t even something he had tried to destroy.
A gold frame surrounded what looked like a family photo, but the boy couldn’t tell for sure.
He turned his eyes to the old man, who stared calmly out the window.
Red-stained bandages wrapped his hands like vines around two broken weapons.
The only sound in the room was the delicate tapping of his right leather shoe.
The cruise ship remained out on the sea.
“Hasn’t moved in a while,” the old man said quietly. “Wonder if they’ll stay the night.”
The boy stayed silent, still trying to comprehend what he had just witnessed.
The old people he usually read to would eventually fall asleep — that was his cue to leave.
“Sorry I lashed out like that,” the old man said, pulling his gaze from the window to his hands. “I have my episodes.”
No response.
Instead, the boy’s ears caught something else — a ticking clock, slow and rhythmic.
His leg started to bounce.
Each bounce fueled the urge to speak, but he stayed frozen in complete consternation.
“Hey, boy, are you gonna keep reading that book of yours?” the old man asked, voice light. “I was enjoying it.”
Still no answer.
“Son. I’m talking to you.”
“Sorry, Mister. I was just thinking ‘bout something.”
The boy opened his book and continued reading from where he left off.









Chapter 6:
The clock’s ticking grew heavier, like a slow drumbeat echoing through the boy’s chest. The book shook lightly in his hands, the words blurring, but he forced himself to keep reading: “A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who the guy is, long’s he’s with you. I tell ya, a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets sick.” The boy’s voice cracked. He lowered the book, his heart hammering. Across the room, the old man was watching him — not angry, not afraid—just waiting, as if he knew something the boy didn’t. The boy turned to the window. At first, he thought he had imagined it. But no, someone was standing at the shoreline. A figure, unmoving, axe in hand. Its face wasn’t a face at all, but a swirling canvas of blurred colors — pale, dark, golden, bruised — a thousand identities melted into one. Behind it, the sky had started to bleed. The blue sagged like watercolor running down a canvas, clouds tearing apart into brushstrokes. The cruise ship bobbed unsteadily, its once-perfect windows now hollow squares, its bow twisting sharply downward. The boy blinked hard. The figure was gone. The ticking quickened. It filled his head until he thought his skull might crack open. A hand closed softly around his arm — not tight this time, just enough to hold him still. The old man leaned close, his voice a low murmur:
“Son, I wish you had been wiser than I. I wish you had loved yourself enough to stay. I wish you had seen that you were always enough.”
The boy wrenched free.
“Get away from me!” he cried.
He rushed to the window. The figure was back — This time pointing. The boy followed its gesture. The sea split open. A monstrous black shape surged from the depths, devouring the cruise ship whole. Tiny passengers, barely more than flecks of paint, scrambled uselessly as the vessel vanished beneath the waves. The boy reached for them, but when he looked down, his own arm was unraveling into dust, blown away by a wind he couldn’t feel. He stumbled back and saw the room collapsing. The chandelier dissolved into drifting ash. The walls peeled back into fog. The floor cracked like thin ice, falling away into darkness. The old man, smiling faintly, sat calmly as his body faded into the air like smoke from a dying fire. The ticking slowed.
One beat.
A long pause.
Another.
Then — a final, booming tick.
Everything shattered. 
And the boy fell into silence.













Chapter 7:
The boy woke up. A cold drop of sweat slid down his forehead and onto his itchy cheeks. He looked around. The room was dark, except for a small lamp casting a pool of light on the table beside his bed. An IV tugged at his arm. He could feel the opening of a hospital gown at his back. On the table next to him, he found a remote and pressed the first button his fingers touched. A dim overhead light buzzed to life. He stretched his legs — they reached the end of the bed — but when he went to move them, they didn’t budge. Panicked, he hit his legs with his fists. No feeling. The heart monitor beside him quickened, its beeping rapid and frantic. His body flushed with heat. He lay back against the pillow, staring blankly at the ceiling light. Then the phone on the table started to ring. And ring. And ring. He ignored it. The ringing stopped, and a voicemail played. 
“Hey man, it's me again. I know I keep sending these, and you’re probably still asleep, but I’m gonna keep sending them just in case. Before the accident, you always seemed so dissatisfied. Whether it was work or money, or even your relationship with your wife, you always wanted more. And then what you did with my wife, honestly, dude, I hated you. And now it does come off as harsh, but frankly, it was true. I never wanted to fire you because we were always so close, and in my eyes, you weren’t just my brother, but my best friend in the whole world. And I’m sorry. I’m sorry if I ever made you feel as if you stood in my shadow throughout our childhood together,” the man speaking started to cry, “But you were always the most important, most incredible, and most inspirational person I could ever have in my life. I want you to know that, and I want you to know that you were always enough, not for me, not for Mom and Dad, but for yourself.” He stopped for a moment and sniffled, “Alright, well, I have to be going now, the old guy we always used to see at the bar is waiting for me. He’s actually not as weird as we thought; he’s honestly--” he paused, “--pretty interesting. Anyways, though, I’ll catch you later, man, bye.” 
The phone clicked.
A tear rolled down the boy’s cheek. The light overhead grew brighter and brighter, until the entire room was swallowed in blinding white. And then — darkness. He woke up again. This time, he was standing in the old backyard where he used to play as a child. The air was warm, but his body felt weightless, almost absent. Ahead of him, two young boys — versions of himself and his brother — were laughing and tossing a ball back and forth. He watched silently. After a few moments, the same blinding light appeared again, and darkness returned. Scene after scene played before him: Moments from his life, stitched together like fading photographs. Each memory showing two boys. Each one ending in the same consuming darkness. Until finally, the memories stopped. And darkness was all that remained.

The End.

Instead they came and bashed my front door down, and beat me up, and abused my human rights, they stepped on me with their steel toe boots and put red in my black paints, and they broke my glasses.

All this was done while they bodyslammed me to the ground and one of them used his knee tp hold down my back; while he tried to kiss me, and then took my hand and said: ""see this beautifuk hand; it wont be beautiful anymore, and then he gave me a bleeding gash from carpet burning my hand and then he took my neck and pushed it into the ground. 

I have photos of the bruises, and open wounds.

Then they pushed handcuffs on me as tight as possible, then they forced me to walk outside on the sharp gravel in my socks; they refused to let me get shoes.

They then ransacked mine and my roommates house and stole so many things; most of which they never made a note of.

Including documents, a page of my US passport, and all our electronics, and my phone. 

Then they abused me out the front of my own house while threatening to ""end me"" if i told anyone.

They refused to let me call someone to let them know like you have a right to do upon being arrested.

This was all in front of the smiling constable who instigated all of this.

Then they made me walk on the sharp gravel in my socks and put the tightest possible handcuffs on  me, and then forced me in the back of the police van in front of my stunned roommate who had by then been called at WORK?! we still don't know how they knew where he works & called him there to tell him.

They then took all the dirt roads and swerved and laughed in the front as i banged around in the back like a rag doll.

Then at the jail house they made me wait without air for over 15 mins in the back and it was hot and airless, and the person supervising thought it was all SO FUNNY 

He was like ""yeshaya you are being impatient cause we could've just ended you back at the house, and your still here, so please!""

Then they let me out into hte registry area.

Then they asked me if i had any gold teeth even though it wasn't on the questions they needed to ask.

Then they told me that i am just a number now and then all 3 of them laughed together.

I was freezing the entire time, and they refused to give me anything aside from a tiny cot topper and the weakest coffee possible if i was too cold.

Then in the interoggation room i had to agree to speak to lawyer later if i wanted to leave that day; cause if i stayed the night they might ""end me"" and i ""might not see tomorrow"" 

Also if i wanted to speak to a lawyer tomorrow it had to be in front of him which is against the humans rights; cause you get to have privacy to speak to a lawyer that is the law, they refuseed to give me that right.

Then they were supposed to finger print me and the same constable forced me to let him touch my hands while doing it, and he kept messing it up, so eventually he got ""frustrated"" and decided we ""didn't need to do that anymore""

Then they gave me my clothing and a lighter from my pockets and degraded me and threatened to end me and incarcerate me cause ""no one was coming to get me"" even though my roommate kept calling them constantly to find out what was going. 

Then the constable who instigated and oversaw this entire bullshit operation told me and my roommate different places to meet up once they let me out of a side door.

The entire thing was a dodge power play cause i am an artist.

They damaged 1/3 of my art collection.

Pieces since when i was a kid are now damaged.

I am gonna go to court and get this all taken care of, and ensure that it cannot happen to anyone else!

Cause this is scary af that one constable could make up a bunch of bullshit about you and now you are being charged with 3 crimes you did not commit.

Pictured is the unfinished performance artwork that the constable stole as ""evidence"" 

Plus a collage using affinity photo of the artwork of mine that praises police upside down; cause this entire situation is upside down.

So this is all logical.

They need to make change asap with how much power one law enforcement officer holds.

Cause they lied and all this happened.

I make this artwork for documentation purposes; cause the world need to know what happened to one fo their favorite people.

Selling prints of this manipulated work to help raise money to help me pay for unusual expenses that came up throught this entire situation.

I am also selling manipulated prints to signify how this one dude manipulated this entire situation to make me from the victim of a sexual assault to now being the villian; cause their department refuses to investigate my sexual assault so they did this instead.

He was really hard to read super polite and kind, but gave almost no signals that he was attracted to me. We started with coffee, and since the place was about to close, I suggested we find another spot. Instead, he ended up inviting me to dinner and insisted on paying.

I couldn’t quite tell if it was a great date or just a decent one. We didn’t exactly share the same sense of humor, but the conversation flowed nonstop. After we parted ways at the train station, he texted me right away with a cute message teasing me about getting home before I did. He wished me a great weekend, and I joked about his “lazy Sunday” plans (he was just going to clean his apartment). He liked the message and that was the last I heard from him.

Later, when my friend asked for a photo of him, I went to check the app and realized he had unmatched me. That kind of stung. We still have each other’s numbers, but it’s a bit confusing. I guess I’m just a little disappointed he was really cute and sweet. He did mention that he’s very reserved and shy, which probably explains why he was so hard to read. But I suppose unmatching me was his quiet way of saying he’s not interested.

He doesn't stay over.....saying he has dogs to take care of. 
He's sent pictures of himself at his house, or in his yard....but never talks about having me over.
He's said things like I'm one of the few 'good girls' left, and if we ever move in together I will want for nothing, has sent pics of rings, or upcoming events he says we should check out......but we never do. It feels like he's dangling a carrot to keep me invested, but he's not fully invested himself.

I’m barely holding on. I’ve been holding on these past 8 months and I’ve been hurting myself and crying and I feel so alone and sometimes the pain would be too much but I started having hope and then this last week I’ve lose everything and I don’t think I can do this anymore I can’t keep doing this I feel so alone

I worked at a coffee shop last year and initially I liked working there, I hadn’t made any friends in this new town but I was enjoying going to school for the first time and finally having hope for my future and I enjoyed talking to the people I worked with. I thought a couple of them were my friends, I don’t have many and I get lonely sometimes so those friendships meant a lot to me.

I talked to one of the girls who I thought was my friends, whom i opened up to and joked around with and asked her about the way she was acting towards me. I don’t understand why but afterwards she hated me and started treating me horribly. At first it really hurt my feelings because I thought we were friends but then I just wanted to be left alone.

She would yell at me, spread lies about me, make mean comments towards me, steal my tip money, I didn’t want any confrontation, I just wanted her to stop so I kept my head down and hoped she would eventually stop or someone would help me but no one cared. I never did any of these things to her, I never talked poorly about her or her friends I just came to work kept quiet but she kept making the mean comments and yelling at me and i really struggle with depression and she made me think I was doing something wrong that there was something wrong with me so I started hurting myself.

I didn’t want to hurt myself but she made me think there was something wrong with me and I thought she was my friend and it really hurt me. Eventually I had to make a complaint with hr, I waited months to do that because I didn’t want to but I couldn’t take it anymore. She got other people there to start being mean to me and all these people I was nothing but nice to the entire time I worked there. I would go home and cry and hurt myself and my mental health got really bad.

Eventually I had to quit my job. I really needed that job to pay my bills. I could hardly pay bills and my parents couldn’t pay their bills either so I had no one to help me. I was frustrated and hurt after so I made a post on Snapchat about the situation. I said I had a bad time working there and this girl was mean to me. It was only 2 paragraphs and I just needed to vent after being treated that way for so long and losing my job.

After this girl filed a restraining order against me. She said i followed her because I made a video of myself singing outside the store but I did that everyday and she knew that and at the time i didn’t even know that she still worked there, I thought she moved away but even if she did I just made the videos for fun it had nothing to do with anyone it was just a way to distract myself so I wouldn’t get lonely and seeing people watch my videos made me feel less alone.

She said I was dangerous just so she could get the order approved but I’ve never hurt anyone in my life, I’ve never even pushed someone, my old roommate once got made and came home and tried to fight me and I refused and talked him down not because I was scared but because I don’t believe in violence, I think guns should be illegal and I’m going to school for nursing because I want to work somewhere where I can help people. Helping people makes me happy I like doing nice things for others 

She lied on the order just to get back at me but it messed up a probation I was on and really messed up my life after I spent years working so hard and being called dangerous only made my depression worse. I was already really hurt and sad after all the bullying but this was too much. My depression got really bad and I spiraled and started making videos of myself hurting myself because it was all just too much. Most people don’t understand just how bad depression can get for certain people and I was so hurt and in so much pain. I didn’t understand why I had been treated this way, why this person did all of this to me, why they didn’t care about how much I was hurting I would’ve never wanted them to feel this way

I found a couple of jobs where the people were really nice but one was seasonal, another I didn’t get enough hours at and another I became manager but the owner was mean to everyone but me and I didn’t like that so I left. Sometimes I would feel ok but the depression would always come back I wanted to move on from all of this but when you get bullied that badly, when someone hurts you that badly and spreads lies about you it’s so hard to move on I couldn’t get the depression to get better. I had one coworker I made friends with and she was really nice to me and got me but they told her bad things lies about me and she blocked me and it hurt me so much I felt so alone

I’ve been barely able to pay my bills and afford food. The depression was so bad I kept falling behind in school. I couldn’t do my homework because I would go home and cry and hurt myself and I had to drop most of my classes. Last week I hurt myself really badly but I started feeling a little better over the weekend. I got this job at this place I always wanted to work at and I thought maybe I could be happy again.

Last Sunday I went to the coffee shop in the morning and read my book and after I went to this store where I used to work and got some bread and Red Bull and then went home and watched my tv show. After I had a cop come to my house looking for me wanting to arrest me and I called them and they told me I violated the restraining order by going to this store because this girl worked there and it said on the order I wasn’t supposed to go there.

I was so shocked when I heard this because I had read the order multiple times and never saw it say that but the cop said she was looking right at it and it said that. I didnt know this girl still worked there, it had been 9 months since the order was filed and her school was so far away I figured she quit and got a job closer or wasn’t working. I told my therapist I had been wanting to shop there again and she said it wouldn’t be an issue and even if she worked there and I bumped into her or saw her i would just have to leave the store. I still stayed away because I get really bad anxiety and I was anxious one of those girls who bullied me would yell at me or come up to me but I finally decided to go but I was really anxious so I was in and out. I just wanted to be able to shop there again.

The cop said she was going to arrest me, I was so scared, because of my past charge I thought they were going to lock me up for months. I ran away to my friends in another city and stayed with him for a few days. I thought my life was over I was so scared and sad when all I did was buy some bread and Red Bull and now my life was over I didn’t hurt or bother anybody I’m just trying to get by. Eventually I found out the cop had the wrong info and I was right and I was allowed to go there. 

Because of all of this I missed the first day at this job I was excited for and they terminated me. I already hadn’t paid my rent but now I have no way to. I couldn’t go to my final day in my art class and wasn’t able to turn in my final so I failed the class after spending 5 months spending hours every week working on these art project just to fail now. It was the only class I had left that I didn’t drop because of the depression.

I got an email today a final warning to pay rent but I have no money and my family has no money. I had to go to the school pantry this week and the food bank to get free food because I can’t afford any. Things were finally starting to get better but now they took everything from me when I was barely holding on. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I don’t understand why all of this is happening to me. I don’t know what to do. I didn’t bother anyone by buying some groceries they did this just to punish me to hurt me. I don’t understand why they have such good easy lives they have nice family’s that provide for them they’re happy and not sad like me why would they do all of this to me when I was already barley holding on. I could’ve went to jail I didn’t do anything to deserve that and after they bullied me for months and lied about me and now this

I don’t understand why all of this is happening to me. I don’t know what to do. I’m gonna lose my apartment and I can’t go to school anymore with my depression like this. I feel so alone I’m all alone I’m all alone why do people treat me like this I thought this girl was my friend I don’t understand why she did all of this to me. I was happy when I moved here I was gonna go to school and make new friend and start a new job but I’ve been so sad and hurting myself and in so much pain I just want to be happy again but I never will be this will never go away I’ve lost everything I don’t understand why they did this I don’t know what to do anymore I feel so alone ",1,1746839385.0,bullying,1,1.0,False
