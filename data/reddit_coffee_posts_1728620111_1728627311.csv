TL;DR My bf’s mom kind of lost her shit, told me not to vote, broke a vase, and is apparently scheming to reunite him with his ex-wife. Life’s a beach 🙃

Background: My boyfriend’s mom is a wealthy, widowed, Republican NY boomerette. Her son, my BF, is also Republican, but their beliefs couldn’t be more different. His reasons are much more fiscal whereas hers are definitely social. He’s a never-Trumper, and I know she’s pro-Trump but we have not ever discussed it outright. I’ve met her maybe 4 or 5 times so far and her abject horror at her son dating me (black, first generation, child of immigrants among other transgressions I’m sure) is only thinly veiled at best. She’s made comments about my accent (I speak in a sort of mixed accent as I was born here but my diplomat parents had us all over Europe and for a bit in South Africa while I was growing up, and I got my Bachelor’s degree in Canada. I think I sound a bit transatlantic but I code switch a lot with strangers) - she whispered to him to make sure I wasn’t a spy (ffs) the first time I met her, and when he asked why, she said “oh Ben*, don’t pretend you can’t hear it”, whatever that means. She’s asked me severally if I have my ‘papers’. She’s asked me why I don’t celebrate Thanksgiving in a fairly accusatory tone; I am not against Thanksgiving at all, I just never really celebrated it growing up, so I attend Friendsgiving dinners usually since my parents don’t do a big turkey thing at home. It’s also eternally amazing to her that I can be an attorney in the US even though I am “not from here”. Of course, the usual dog whistles about little things pertaining to my blackness (“I hope you don’t have Ben listening to that rap racket” is a personal favourite).
Also, Ben has had to issue an embargo on political talk as her other son has gone no-contact for five months now, as her comments about his homosexuality and various other lifestyle choices were way out of control on Mothers Day - I was not in attendance.

What happened: we went over to her home on Park yesterday (10/11) for her birthday; she’s usually in NJ but comes into the city for hers and her sons’ birthdays, holidays and things like that. My bf ‘baked’ her a cake - I did it out of a Betty Crocker thing and he bought a candle lol - and we got her a beautiful vase of preserved flowers. He separately got her some stones as she collects loose gems. We arrive around 6pm, and she comes to the door on the phone, opens it and waves us in. She kisses Ben on the cheek as he goes in before me, and waves me along before she shuts the door. She stays on the phone while we kind of arrange ourselves in her sitting room. She was pretty upset about something (we will get to this in a sec) but it’s clear she’s speaking to her sister in Florida. Ben makes me a cuppa and I finish it, this is how long she stayed on the phone. Anyway, she gets off the phone eventually, sighs dramatically, and literally goes,

“You know, Jen, you really can’t keep being a Democrat. They’re awful people.” (Mind you, I’m not a registered anything, I’m pretty centrist, though I lean liberal. She believes I’m a democrat because I loooooove 44 and had the Becoming journal on me one time in her presence. She asked me on that occasion whether Mike’s book was any good. 😡)

I’m taken aback, because… what? In short, apparently Democrats are over the moon about the death and destruction going on in Florida from these hurricanes, because they are happy that Red voters are being wiped out. I just couldn’t even speak after she said this, so Ben comes to the rescue with 

“I’m sure nobody is actually celebrating that, Ma.”

She rounds on him and goes on and on and on about how he’s a “rhino” - he eventually explained to me that she meant RINO - Republican In Name Only, and how his father would be so ashamed of him “running around with this… this…” pointing at me. She wanted to call me a slur, I’m sure, but couldn’t. She then suddenly breaks down into tears and starts basically sobbing her way through a “where did we go wrong with you boys” soliloquy - essentially how she can’t believe how they turned out.
She quiets down, and we sit in silence for maybe 5 minutes. I text Ben to say we should just present her gifts and leave. He says OK, and as soon as he says “Ok Ma, we just -“ she immediately lifts her head and looks right at me and says “Don’t vote, Jen.” 

Like… what.

I say nothing, and she says “Don’t vote. You are not American and you don’t know what this election means to us.” 

I am beyond speaking at this point because I can be pretty scathing when I am angry but I don’t want to escalate things because… well, it’s his mom, you know? I look at Ben and he gets up, picks the flower arrangement up from the coffee table (lol) and says to me “Let’s go”. His mom goes into a weird frenzy kind of holding him back physically like you would if you were trying to get a man to abandon a fight (so weird and misplaced for the circumstances), yelling all manner of “please don’t do this to me” sort of things. I go straight to the hall and get my coat on, he eventually wrangles out of her grip, I guess, gets there, and hands me the arrangement so he can get his own coat on. She follows him, wrenches the arrangement from me - it comes in a ceramic vase - and literally throws it to the floor while actually screaming, whereupon the vase breaks. She’s like out of breath, kind of heaving. It was so surreal to me. She turns around and essentially storms towards the stairs, so Ben opens the door. She then finishes with “THANK YOU FOR A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY” as we leave 😮‍💨

In the car to my place, she called Ben, he picked up 😒, and she reveals that she’s been in touch with his ex-MIL and they are willing to “get you two back together” - the ex-wife is in a new relationship of her own btw. 👀👀👀 She says “you know what you’re doing is wrong, and I won’t keep pretending about it”. He hung up on her. She’s sent him several texts reiterating the same sentiments.

I’m so shaken and furious about this whole thing, I can’t sleep. She usually at least pretends to be “above it all” even with her little jabs. I think definitely her sister and brother in law, who are Trump-signs-in-the-yard Floridians, have maybe pushed her over the edge, but… my goodness. That was A LOT. I’m also very frustrated that he won’t sort of stand up to her and is happy to disengage or ignore, rather than “HEY, DON’T SAY THAT”. You know?

P.s. We are obviously not actually named Ben and Jen lol",1,1728626931.0,BoomersBeingFools,1,1.0,False

1g135px,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacificDrive/comments/1g135px/lore_theory_oppy_sang_the_song_train_song_by/,"Lore Theory: Oppy sang the song ""Train Song"" by Ilene Dracott","Warning: Post contains significant spoilers for parts of the game's lore that get brought up in-game. Also, there is a TL;DR at the end since this post is quite long

I theorize that the song ""Train Song"" by Ilene Dracott is supposed to have been sung by Oppy in the Pacific Drive world. From the first time I really gave it a good listen I got this feeling that it fit with the Pacific Drive world in a really odd way that most of the other songs didnt (although some others certainly do too), almost as if someone living in this world was the one to make it. I've heard that some of the songs in the game's soundtrack were commissioned specifically for this game, so the idea has a bit of credibility on the surface but there's some more things that I believe give this theory solid plausibility.

Before the rest of this post, here's a link to the song for you to give it a listen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSnRRtfBIIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSnRRtfBIIc)

I wasn't able to find the lyrics for this song *anywhere*, so here's my attempt at transcribing it. I know there's some errors with it, but I tried my best: *The train is pulling out the station. The wind is blowing us away somebody. Stop, this, forced, on me. I have a fear about the future, cuz when you're bitten something new you never know, what the cost will be. But we'll just wait, till it's too late. I got caught up in a dream can someone tell me what it means to live and forgive and let love and let go. Somehow it stopped making sense, living between the distress, I'm making a life but I also am takin a home. The tracks are jumping on their own now, the rain is asking if I know how much it hurts, when the Earth angry. But we can't know what could have grown. The rain don't fall, the wind will blow na na na, the tracks will pull us down below na na na, they may control the money's flow na na na, my aching soul is terrible na na na, my aching soul is terrible. My aching soul is terrible, my aching soul is terrible, my aching soul is terrible...*

  
First off, this song was released on February 20 2024, and published on Spotify on February 22 2024. The game was released on Steam on February 21 2024, so this song was released right around when the game was, so it seems to me quite likely this is one of the songs that was made specifically for Pacific Drive. Given that, if we start looking for the song's possible meaning, this song seems full to the brim with meaning. First off, there seems to be a pretty consistent sad theme going on here: a train pulling away, wind blowing us away, being bitten by something new, everything stopping making sense, my aching soul? This sounds to me like the words of someone living through the Olympic Peninsula's stuff, and how nonsensical and chaotic it all is. 

Thinking about who could potentially have sung it, think about it, who has gone through a lot in this game's lore? Oppy sure has. In particular, the repeated ""My aching soul is terrible"" at the end really gives me the impression that whoever wrote this was really hurt whenever they wrote this. This would make sense if say, Oppy wrote it, especially if it were shortly after her husband Allen died in 1961 to a gamma ray surge. She wouldve been immensely distraught due to this occurrence, and it makes sense that it might lead her to trying to find an outlet for her emotions. Writing a song about how you feel could definitely be such an outlet, so it makes sense that given what happened to Oppy, she mightve written a song about it to help handle her own feelings.

As for why I think Train Song specifically is that song, if you look at it from the lens of the idea that Oppy wrote it after Allen died, a lot of the lyrics come together really well. The start of the song seems to be the sort of thing Oppy wouldve been going through before Allen died. Dealing with the Olympic Peninsula's nonsense, wind blowing us away and never knowing the cost of being bitten (the various anomalies are all sorts of hazards). 

Next, ""But we'll just wait, till it's too late"" is a direct reference to the fact Oppy and Allen planned to leave the zone and have a family, but Oppy was too focused on trying to solve the mess she made and eventually lost Allen because of it. They waited, until it was too late, and Allen lost his life in the zone. This is immediately followed by Oppy talking about getting caught up in a dream, and wondering how to live and forgive and let love and let go. This could be a direct reference to the mass hallucination that happened right after the gamma ray surge and Allen's death, in which Oppy ""hallucinated"" Allen at her lab, bringing her a coffee and Oppy touching him and smelling his cologne. Since Oppy wasnt sure if this was reality, she mightve tried to push it aside as just a dream. 

The lyrics about what it means to live and forgive and let love and let go are her in the aftermath of this event asking how to move on. How does she live without Allen, how does she forgive herself for this happening (it wouldnt have if they'd left sooner, so she likely wouldve felt responsible for his death), how does she let her love herself again, and how does she let go of this part of her past? These are very plausible questions Oppy mightve been asking herself after Allen's death. Her then going on to say that everything stopped making sense living between the distress sounds like a description of how she couldve felt while suffering from the emotional distress of Allen's death. She mightve felt lost, and like nothing in her life made sense anymore, after all this was the death of her husband whom she loved very dearly. Tracks jumping on their own, rain asking her if she knows how much something else hurts, as if trying to belittle her own pain, this sounds like more of the sort of stuff someone coping with the loss of a loved one would feel and perceive. 

""But we can't know what could have grown"" sounds like her feeling regretful for what couldve been if her and Allen had just left earlier, and gone on to live the life they both planned to. She wishes she couldve gotten to see that future. However, it does also seem to allude to how his death caused Oppy to dive even harder into her work, desperate for answers as to what happened with the mass hallucination, and with Allen. This tracks with the more upbeat tone of the next few lines, each of them ending with na na na. I think the line about ""them"" controlling the money's flow specifically refers to ARDA's control over the entire program and perhaps that Oppy was forced to get back to her work, or else funding would be rerouted from her work to somewhere else, or someone else who could actually get work done. However, ultimately, she is still extremely upset about it, and goes on to repeatedly mention how much her soul aches and how terrible it is, hence ""My aching soul is terrible"" repeated 5 times in a row, and being the end of the song.

All in all, to me it seems that to me this song is a perfect representation of how Oppy felt about and after Allen's death, and it makes me very strongly inclined to think that she's the one who wrote it, specifically not long after his death, so probably near the end of 1961. So many of the lines just make sense if you think about them being written from the POV of a very distraught Oppy, and in the context of her life more generally at that point in time. If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading, this is all just a theory I came up with on a whim and spent the last hour and a half putting to text. However, I do think it holds some serious water. If nothing else, it seems a really good theory. 



TL;DR: I think it's supposed to be the case that Oppy wrote Train Song around the end of 1961, in the aftermath of her husband Allen's death, as an outlet for her pain from losing him. The entire song, which already seems like it fits in with Pacific Drive's world oddly well, makes so much sense if you think about it as being written from her POV at that point in time, and the entire song seems full of meaning and references to specific events and circumstances.

I had just left the Jazz Record Mart and picked up a nice stack of jazz records (the good 'ol days when a $20 bill could get you a big stack of records and all in nice shape, before records became popular again).

I noticed him right away, but didn't want to bother him, so as he walked past the two-topper table I was sitting at, I just said ""Hey, Ernie"" with a quick wave. He smiled and said ""Hello!"" back to me as he went to find a seat, but then he stopped, took a few steps back, and looked at the record I was holding. It was No Room For Squares by Hank Mobley. He said ""Hey, that's a great album!"" I said ""Yeah, I can't wait to put it on my turntable and give it a listen when I get home! I have Soul Station by Mobley and really love that album!"" He actually sat down in the other seat to look at the other ones I had bought. I don't remember all of them, because there were around 15 or so in the stack, but some of the ones I do remember were All Mornin' Long by Red Garland, Bohemia After Dark by Kenny Clarke, Boss Tenors: Straight Ahead From Chicago by Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt, Sweets by Harry Edison, and Soulville by Ben Webster.

Sure the initial spark and NRE was fun, but if I’m being honest I much prefer the comfortability and routine we have now. 

I love waking up and sending our “good morning” and “how are you today” texts. I love my meta and I sending each other updates on our respective gardens. I love cozy mornings at their shared home when I sleep over and our hinge making us pancakes while me and meta have our coffee together. I love that me and meta are both early risers and have at least an hour together to talk and bond before our hinge even thinks about waking up. 

I love that when I told our hinge that I had something on my mind lately and would tell him soon but not yet, he immediately clocked me as wanting to start T and get top surgery, and had the absolutely most heartwarming and supportive reaction I could have ever received. So much so that I told him the next day that he was right. I love that when I finally started T and was having trouble getting shot supplies, him and my meta set me up with a bundle of theirs bc they had just restocked. 

I love meeting his friends and having him meet mine and sharing in the fact that we all love him, and feeling very strongly that they all love me. I love my friends all always asking how him and my meta are doing because they know how important they are to me. 

I love long drives with my meta and hearing them open up and be vulnerable, because they’re for sure the most reserved out of the three of us and they don’t always say what they’re thinking. 

I love drunk Taco Bell when our hinge sleeps at mine after a night out, because meta doesn’t like crowds or loud spaces but I do so when one of us wants to go to an event, the other is usually more than happy to have a night out, and meta is happy to have a quiet night at home. 

I love decorating Christmas cookies and exchanging gifts and having a cute Christmas as a trio, and I love that they’re excited to meet my other connections at my birthday party next week. 

I love that our hinge keeps a notes app in his phone to remember things about me and meta because his memory is terrible. I love him somehow actually remembering little things that I mentioned I was looking for, and making an effort to find them for me. 

I love so much that even though they live together and there is a clear hierarchy, I have never been made to feel “less than” or like I’m his second choice. I love that we’ve spent the past three years choosing each other and watching each other all grow and change, and how we all choose to readjust ourselves to fit around each other again. 

This is by far the most secure and supported  I have ever felt in any relationship! It gets better every day, and I hope I get to love them both forever in whatever form that may take. Every day I feel so lucky to be on this journey with such cool and genuinely caring people. ",1,1728625938.0,polyamory,3,1.0,False
1g12zbk,https://i.redd.it/9pd7d4zdg2ud1.jpeg,Do you offer revisions if I'm not satisfied with the animation?,"""Do You Offer Revisions If I'm Not Satisfied with the Animation?""

Ah, the classic “Do you offer revisions?” question. It's like asking if you can send back your latte because they forgot the almond milk. Spoiler alert: the answer is YES! But let’s have a little fun with it.


---

1. The First Draft: It’s Like Pizza—Good, But Could Use More Toppings

Listen, the first draft of an animation is kind of like ordering pizza. You know it’s gonna be good, but maybe you want to add a little something. Extra cheese? Pepperoni? How about a smoother transition or a splash of color? Revisions are our way of sprinkling in those toppings, so you get the perfect slice of animation magic.


---

2. Your Vision, Our Animation: Let’s Make Sure They Match

We totally get it. Sometimes what’s in your head doesn’t exactly show up on the screen, and you’re like, “Wait, what happened here?” Think of it like online shopping. You expect that jacket to look just like the picture, but then it arrives, and… nope. So, if the animation isn’t quite what you imagined, we go back to the drawing board (literally) until it matches your vision—without the buyer’s remorse.


---

3. Revisions: The Goldilocks Effect—Let’s Get It Just Right

Animation isn’t a “one and done” deal. We want it to be just right. Not too fast, not too slow, but that perfect sweet spot where you’re sitting back like, “Ah, this is the one.” You know, like Goldilocks finding that perfect bowl of porridge—except with fewer bears and more creative flair.


---

4. The Drama-Free Revision Process: No Tears, Just Tweaks

Let’s be honest—revisions can sound stressful, like a bad breakup conversation: “It’s not you, it’s me. Can we change this?” But fear not! Our revision process is as smooth as your morning cup of coffee. No drama, no hard feelings—just tweaks to make sure your animation looks as awesome as you imagined. Think of us as your creative therapists, here to listen and fix what needs fixing.


---

5. Revision Roulette: The More the Merrier? Not Quite!

Now, hold on—before you get revision-happy and request changes until your logo is doing the Macarena, remember, revisions are meant to refine, not reinvent. We love making adjustments, but we’re not looking to turn your logo into a Marvel movie with 17 rewrites. Let’s keep it balanced and focused. After all, too many chefs in the kitchen and suddenly your soup tastes like everything except what you ordered.


---

6. The Big Finale: When You’re Grinning, We’re Winning

At the end of the day, we don’t stop until you feel proud to show off your new animation like it’s your latest TikTok dance. You’ll know it’s right when you’re smiling from ear to ear, ready to share it with the world. And hey, if we need to do a couple of revisions to get there, that’s what we’re here for.


---

So, yes, we offer revisions. It’s all about teamwork, tweaking the little things, and making sure your animation is exactly what you want—without the headache. Let’s just skip the Macarena, alright? 😄

1g12z2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1g12z2s/kendu_inu_understand_everything_in_4_minutes_1010/,KENDU INU: Understand Everything in 4 Minutes! (10/10 update),"Since its launch on February 21, 2024, a lot has been added to make Kendu an exceptional crypto project.

To help you understand the value and potential of Kendu in just a few minutes, here is a (non-exhaustive) list of concrete facts about KENDU INU.

The points covered are enough to show that this project is a true social movement, even a cult, and that it will undoubtedly reach several billion dollars in market capitalization because there is a well-thought-out strategy behind it all.



I. THE COMMUNITY

1. Constant Growth: The Kendu community continues to grow and has reached 14,350 token holders on-chain (excluding exchanges) after nearly 8 months.

2. Work Culture: The predominant mentality within the community is focused on mutual support, hard work, self-improvement, and the real-life development of the project.

3. Continuous Engagement: The Telegram group is active 24/7, offering a positive and supportive atmosphere with an almost complete absence of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).

4. Top-Level Expertise: Prominent figures, such as a Hollywood producer, coding experts, crypto pioneers, artists, and many other professionals, are actively involved in the project.

5. Overflowing Creativity: The community produces memes, GIFs, music, and videos daily, each crazier than the last, to promote Kendu Inu.

6. Multichannel Presence: Platforms such as YouTube, Reddit, Spotify, and various social media accounts are actively used to expand the reach of Kendu Inu (X, TikTok, Instagram, Stocktwits, etc.).

7. Specialized Communities: Specific communities are developing for languages other than English, thereby enhancing the diversity and inclusivity of the community. Francophone, Brazilian, German, Hungarian, and other communities are emerging.

8. Real People: Many community members have revealed their faces in original videos made in real life for Kendu. The community no longer hides behind pseudonyms and has decided to conquer the real world.

9. Fun Activities: The community regularly organizes games and challenges among themselves, such as poker nights, a challenge to complete 100k push-ups before the end of the year, Photoshop contests, and more. The group is thriving!

II. THE DEV : MIAZAKI

1. Enigmatic Visionary: Miazaki, the lead developer, is recognized for his leadership qualities and in-depth knowledge of the crypto ecosystem.

2. History of Success: Having previously led several successful projects (kept secret until now), Kendu Inu represents his ultimate masterpiece.

3. Connection to Shiba: His friendship with Shytoshi, the lead developer of Shiba, demonstrates his pedigree and strong network within the industry.

4. ""Chad"" Mentality: Miazaki advocates for a culture of hard work, emphasizing the importance of earning success in the crypto universe.

5. Intriguing Speculations: Clues suggest that Miazaki could be the mysterious Ryoshi, the original developer of Shiba.

https://preview.redd.it/vt6dv2ujf2ud1.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=5087c7e1e7e137224750663653cb3dfea514359f



III. THE PROJECT

1. Solid Foundations: Kendu Inu is exclusively based on the Ethereum blockchain, a platform renowned for long-term and high-cap projects.

2. Transparency and Security: The contract has been renounced, and liquidity has been burned, ensuring the absence of fraud or manipulation risks.

3. Meme Ecosystem: Officially classified as a ""memecoin,"" Kendu Inu is developing a complete ecosystem, such as Kenduchads, which has already launched.

4. Organic Growth: The project is growing naturally, without relying on paid influencers, thus ensuring healthy and sustainable growth.

5. Thoughtful Strategy: Drawing inspiration from Shiba's success, Kendu Inu focuses on building a strong community before fully revealing its value proposition.

6. Listing on Major Exchanges: Kendu Inu is already listed on 14 major exchanges: MEXC, BingX, Lbank, Bitmart, Azbit, ProBit, FameEX, BigOne, Poloniex, Biconomy, GroveX, SuperEx, CoinEx, and Bilaxy.

https://preview.redd.it/5v9mryvlf2ud1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab474ae456dcb3886e71115607a174931e3455d2

  


1. ***First Revelation of the Ecosystem: Kenduchads***

Kenduchads consists of two things: a NFT exchange platform and a collection of 10,000 NFTs.

The NFT collection has been fully minted and represents the largest minting of the last two years in terms of financial value. That’s no small feat!

The appeal of this NFT collection is that 2.5% (potentially 5% later) of the volume generated on the exchange platform will be returned to the holders of the Chad NFTs in the form of ETH. This is exactly the same concept as a company’s stock with its dividends. The potential for passive income is immense (see table)!

https://preview.redd.it/hsvtae8of2ud1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=d773080242999f5dc04b8729239247c1962865c3

This completed minting has allowed for the unveiling of the NFT platform version 1, which enables the buying and selling of Chad NFTs. The V2 of this platform will be revealed very soon and will allow for the buying and selling of all existing NFTs. Exclusive partnerships are already secured, and others are in talks with artists and projects for the NFT platform. The ambitions are high!

https://preview.redd.it/rnwqb4epf2ud1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=4821082c74bfbc2c624c63fc4f83d86d82f53d07

  


IV. SOME METRICS

1. Consolidation Phase: With a current market capitalization around $50 million, the redistribution is extremely healthy for the longevity of the token. There are 8k more holders than at the ATH, significantly fewer large wallets can dump the chart, and a substantial portion of the tokens is now in the wallets of people who sincerely believe in the project. This consolidation phase is essential for reaching new heights, as Shiba did.

2. Balanced Distribution: The percentages of tokens held by the major holders demonstrate a balanced and healthy distribution.

3. Goals: Kendu Inu officially announces its ambition to be the first memecoin to reach a $100 billion market capitalization. Let’s be honest! This is entirely feasible thanks to the established cult, the development strategy, and the ecosystem being developed. Shiba reached $40 billion with a less capitalized crypto market in 2021, and with an ecosystem that is less promising than Kendu’s. Moreover, Kendu may have Ryoshi as a developer, bringing the experience needed to achieve even greater success.

  


V. IMPORTANT FACTS

1. Shytoshi has been following Kendu's X account for exactly 1 million mc, as requested by Miazaki. He also came into Kendu's main Telegram to announce that they would be discussing Kendu in an upcoming Shib magazine.

2. Article in Shib Mag: The article was published on June 5, 2024 (link here). This article proves that the ambitions for Kendu are very real and that the means to realize them are powerful.

3. Kendu has already stepped out of the virtual world: It sponsored a chic and exclusive evening at one of the largest nightclubs in Sydney. It has been displayed on billboards in Times Square in New York and in Las Vegas. It is also featured in the most popular nightclub in Thailand, among others. Additionally, there are actual pendants with the Kendu logo and bracelets.

4. Community members have launched their own businesses developing products under the Kendu brand: energy drinks, coffee, protein products, and an event management company in India!

https://preview.redd.it/2haphic5g2ud1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ee81e00c3f3743cc66b868f4d4cbc1ac4d5028

5. A documentary is planned, produced by this famous Hollywood producer. The idea is to follow the behind-the-scenes process of creating a crypto project from scratch to reach billions of dollars.

6. Coinbase highlighted ""KENDU"" at the center of its advertising video for its Coinbase wallet. At these levels, this is not by chance, considering that Kendu is the only memecoin with a ""small"" market cap featured in their advertisement.

7. Miazaki announced that an important person will join the Kendu project at the end of 2024. At the same time, Shytoshi announced that he would be leaving the Shiba project at the end of 2024. Are these two announcements related?

8. Eleven people have already goten Kendu tatoos, which is exceptional for a project at this level of development. We even have a member who tatooed his penis, and it was filmed! This shows just how passionate the community is!

https://preview.redd.it/b291als7g2ud1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=422ed6a9901a7f4cf5bb676504ac9f4c06de29f9

9. Several people were warned (either before the launch or at the very beginning) that this project was going to be huge! Important figures in the crypto space have never been so excited about a project!

  


With these elements, you understand why Kendu Inu is much more than just a crypto project. It is a dedicated community, a promising ecosystem, and a strategic investment for the future of decentralized finance.

Instead, it could all be part of a super-advanced computer simulation created by a civilization far more advanced than ours. Sounds like a plot straight out of \*The Matrix\*, right? But what if I told you that this idea, known as Simulation Theory, is being seriously discussed by some of the greatest minds today, including tech figures like Elon Musk? This isn't just some fringe theory anymore; it's become a modern philosophical debate that blurs the line between science fiction and reality.**

 

[Brain in Simulation](https://preview.redd.it/zprcdx8md2ud1.png?width=6222&format=png&auto=webp&s=1286982003bcb8507a82e37999d1b47fb06bc119)

# So, what is Simulation Theory? 

Simulation Theory suggests that the reality we experience, including everything from the natural world to our deepest emotions, could be artificially generated. In essence, it proposes that we might be living inside a computer program so advanced that it perfectly mimics the world we perceive as ""real."" Consider the progression of video game technology, where graphics, artificial intelligence, and environments are becoming increasingly realistic. Now, envision this progress continuing for thousands or even millions of years into the future. Could it be possible for a highly advanced civilization to create a virtual world that is indistinguishable from reality?

This is the fundamental concept behind Simulation Theory: rather than being the first civilization, we are actually characters in a detailed simulation created by a far more advanced civilization. Philosopher Nick Bostrom brought this idea into the academic spotlight in 2003, presenting a compelling argument: if it's possible for future civilizations to create highly realistic simulations, then statistically, it's far more likely that we're living in one of those simulations rather than being part of the ""original"" base reality.

# Elon Musk and the 1-in-billions odds

If this idea still seems too hard to believe, let's take a moment to think about why people like Elon Musk are so convinced. Musk famously stated that the chances of us \*not\* living in a simulation are ""one in billions."" He based his reasoning on the rapid advancement of technology. Just consider how much progress we've made in a short period of time—from simple video games like Pong to immersive VR experiences, to AI models that can hold human-like conversations (similar to what you're reading now). Musk believes that if technological progress continues at its current rate, it's inevitable that future societies will create simulations so advanced that the inhabitants won't even realize they're in one.

# But wait, how would this even work?

Consider our technological advancements. Today, we are capable of creating simulations such as video games, VR environments, and AI systems that imitate human interactions. These can be seen as basic versions of what Simulation Theory proposes. With the rapid growth of AI and computing power, we may eventually reach a point where virtual worlds are indistinguishable from reality.

Envision a future where we can transfer human consciousness into a digital realm. In this scenario, entire virtual universes could be constructed, inhabited by beings unaware that they are part of a simulation. Similar to characters in a video game, these ""people"" would have their own thoughts, experiences, and realities. Now, imagine an advanced civilization doing the same thing to us. If they possessed the computing power to simulate entire universes, what would prevent them from creating countless simulated realities? How would we ever discern whether we are in one?

# The ""Ancestor Simulation"" Theory

One intriguing concept within Simulation Theory is the idea of ""ancestor simulations."" This theory proposes that future civilizations may seek to understand their history by simulating their ancestors—us. Essentially, they would create intricate virtual worlds with simulated people (representing us) to explore the evolution of societies, politics, technology, and even consciousness.

In this theory, everything in our world is considered to be just data running in an advanced supercomputer. The ""sun"" we see is merely a programmed light source, and our ""memories"" could be fabricated background stories designed to fill in the gaps. The relationships we cherish might be pre-programmed interactions in the simulation. This concept may sound mind-blowing, but it's not entirely different from how we create characters in video games, complete with backstories and personality traits. The main difference is that the simulation would be so intricate that we'd never know it wasn't real.

 

# Is there any proof of this?

What evidence do we have that suggests we might be living in a simulation? Honestly, nothing concrete. Yet, there are some intriguing arguments that keep the theory alive. For instance, some scientists point to the mathematical structure of the universe. The laws of physics, the constants that govern everything from gravity to the speed of light, are oddly precise—almost as if they were programmed that way.

Additionally, there's the fact that quantum mechanics, which deals with the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, seems to suggest that reality only ""solidifies"" when observed, much like how video game environments only load when a player moves into a new area. Could it be that reality itself only manifests when we are conscious of it, just like in a simulation?

There's also something called the ""Fermi Paradox,"" which questions why, if the universe is so vast and old, we haven't yet encountered advanced extraterrestrial life. One possible explanation is that we're in a simulation, and those ""aliens"" don't exist because they were never programmed into our reality.

# The philosophical implications

If we are living in a simulation, it raises some mind-boggling questions. For starters, what does this mean for free will? If our actions and thoughts are just lines of code in some cosmic computer program, are we really making decisions, or is everything predetermined? And what about the nature of existence itself? If reality is simulated, does it matter whether it's ""real"" or not? After all, if we can feel pain, experience joy, and live out our lives with meaning, isn't that good enough?

It also makes you wonder: What happens when the simulation ends? Could the ""end of the world"" just be a scenario where the programmers decide to pull the plug? Or maybe we'll never even notice if they tweak the simulation, like updating a video game with a new patch.

 

**Are we just getting carried away?**

Of course, there's also the possibility that Simulation Theory is just an elaborate form of modern existentialism—a way for people to grapple with the rapid advancements in AI, virtual reality, and technology. It taps into our growing discomfort with the digital age, where lines between reality and artificiality are becoming more blurred by the day. In a world where deepfake videos, AI-generated art, and digital interactions dominate our lives, maybe it's only natural that we start to question the very nature of reality itself.

**So, what do you think?**

Simulation Theory forces us to ask some pretty deep questions about life, existence, and the nature of reality. It's a mind-bending concept that makes you reconsider everything you take for granted. But whether we're living in a base reality or a highly advanced computer simulation, it seems like we're still going to wake up tomorrow, drink our coffee, and go about our daily lives.

Still, it makes you wonder: What if everything you know is just lines of code? What if your entire reality, your memories, and your experiences are part of a massive simulation? Would you want to know, or are you content just living your life, whether it's real or not?

1g12p4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g12p4h/ro_the_journey_of_us_chapter_13_and_chapter_14/,[RO] The Journey Of Us Chapter 13 And Chapter 14,"  Next day I saw Max wearing the same shirt which Josh had purchased. I was sure that Josh was dating Max. Chris went to warned Max that Josh is not  good.

  She didn't listen to him and said, “You should stay away from us. We are opponents. Josh and I teamed up to defeat you so you should worry about yourself.”

  It was the new plan. Josh was trying to let Chris out of the competition. Max was just a bait. He had brainwashed Max. She was trying to get Chris out of the competition. 

  Chris was sad. He said, “Maybe Josh will win this time too.” I tried to console him by saying, “Don't worry. You are good at studies. We just need to tell everyone that you can be a great class president.” 

  Julia said, “Maybe you should make a list.” I asked her, “What list?” Julia answered, “A list where Chris will do everything that will be in the list.” 

  Chris replied, “For instance, making a new court for basketball as it is old.” I said, “Nice start.” Chris and I went towards the sports stadium.  He was making the list. I went into the canteen to buy a coffee for him. When I returned back I saw Josh arguing with Chris. 

  I heard Chris saying, “Do what you can do?” Josh turned back and went away. He didn't notice that I was behind him. I asked Chris, “What did I miss?” 

  He said, “Josh happened. Max told her that I told her to stay away from him. And also that he is not a good person.” I said, “Don't worry. He will not win.” 

  I didn't know what to do. I mean Josh does not have a heart of stone like he shows it to everyone. He has a soft side too. He apologised to me even though I didn't want to see him. He made efforts and took care of me when I was hurt. 

  He saw the minute details of me such as when I was hurt which I didn't even notice. He didn't have a heart of stone. Was he really a heart-breaker?

I was at school when Josh called me. I didn't look at him and tried to avoid him. He came towards me and said, “Are you avoiding me? Did I do something wrong again?” 

  I looked at him and walked forward. He came in front of me and said, “Did I do something wrong? Why aren’t you talking?” I said, “I thought you changed but you are the same old Josh.” 

  He said, “What do you mean?” I said, “I saw you arguing with Chris. He’s my friend.” He said, “I don't know what he said but I didn’t break anyone’s heart.” I said, “Don't lie to me. I heard you when we were talking to your friend.” 

  He was quiet for some time and then moved away. I attended my Maths lecture. Josh had not attended any lecture. I helped Chris with his speech. 

  The class ended. Josh came towards me and requested, “Can we talk for a second?” I accepted and we went to a place where we can be alone.

  He said, “I know you think that I am a bad person. Please give me a chance to explain myself.” “Alright. Explain yourself.” I said. He spoke in a low voice, “I didn't want to break their breaks but I wanted to be class president. This was my only option.”

  I said, “There are many other options. You ruined many lives. You can't change that.” He said, “I know but I have changed. And I think I love you.” 

  I said loudly, “What?” He said, “I love you. I don't know when it started. I guess the first time when we met and you punched me. I tried different ways to meet you. I took you to a restaurant so that you can forgive me.” 

  I said, “You really think you can buy me with money. I don't want your money. And stay away from me.” I tried to walk away when he held my hand and pushed me towards him and said, “Please believe me. I have changed.”

  I pulled my hand from him and said, “I don't think so. You are still the old Josh I can think of. I don't think I can love you after knowing all this.” I walked away.

  Max saw us from far away. She got jealous. I returned back home from school. I was devastated. I didn't knew what to do.

I’m in my 20s 5’7 and started at 227 lbs. I’ve gone on a pretty restrictive diet of 8oz of chicken a day split into 2 meals , and allot of broccoli and then an apple with each meal. I’ve been on this diet for about 8 days with counting all my calories into my fitness pal down to the last spice. This averages to around 400-700 calories. At first I felt really hungry and had cravings. But now I’m barely hungry and don’t crave anything. I had one cheat meal at the 7 day mark. I lost 11lbs in 7 days. But have seemed to plateau at 216lbs. Also on day 5 I did a 24 hour fast. I’m curious on seeing if my weight loss continues to be rapid, or if stuck at this weight which seems unlikely. During this diet im allowing diet sodas and truvia sweetener for my coffee. I’m restricting any oils and fatty meats, and absolutely no processed foods. I’m also supplementing with MCT oil and magnesium, D3, and fish oil. I’m also not doing any weight lifting due to the low calorie intake and wanting to reduce any inflammation. But I have been a frequent power lifter for about a year I’m not worried about lost gains because the main goal is to get lean. I’ll be posting weekly updates if I remember so tune in to see what happens. My goal weight is 150-160",0,1728624431.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.5,False

1g12kck,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1g12kck/my_husband_thinks_i_wasted_my_maternity_leave/,My husband thinks I wasted my maternity leave,"I'm on week 10 of my 12 week leave. Tonight my husband told me he's disappointed I didn't make more of my time. I told him the first 3-4 weeks I was bleeding and in pain while being just a little overwhelmed learning how to take care of a newborn. Then this week I had to have a revision to my stitches from labor, which has set me back to bleeding and being in serious discomfort.

I will admit l've watched tv and scrolled more than I normally would, but I have also done all kinds of activities with and without baby. I've had plenty of girls nights, gone to baby showers and birthday parties, gone to a few concerts, taken the baby on two weekend trips to see family, watched the baby solo for a few days while my husband has been out of town twice (once for fun, once for work), yoga class, gone on coffee and lunch dates with girlfriends, taken baby for walks, crafts, the usual trips to Costco/target/grocery shopping...the list goes on.

He feels that l've been lazy and not productive with my time and I will look back and regret not maximizing doing activities with the baby that I won't be able to do when I'm back to work. He says when the baby starts daycare and we only have a few hours together every evening that I will wish I had done more activities. I was completely shocked by this for a few reasons. 1. I've absolutely loved my maternity leave. Sure, I haven't been as productive as usual but l've been loving sitting on the couch holding my baby whenever possible 2. I feel like I have done a ton of activities. Potentially more than the average mom on leave 3. I thought I was doing a great job adjusting to motherhood and doing the things I felt up for physically and emotionally. Now I feel like he thinks I'm failing.

I have explained until I'm blue in the face that this is one of the few times in life I have every excuse to sit back and do absolutely nothing other than take care of and bond with the baby. Unfortunately, he is a busy body who can't sit still and just doesn't see it that way. He starts two months of leave when I go back to work and he keeps telling me he's going to have a routine every day of walks, set amounts of tummy time, activities for baby, etc.

I don't even know where I'm going with this post. After him confronting me tonight I just feel the need to scream into the void. I’m devastated that he thinks so poorly of me when I feel like I have been doing everything I can for baby. Maybe he will understand where l'm coming from after his leave??? Has anyone else experienced this with their partner?",26,1728624187.0,beyondthebump,45,0.96,False
1g12k7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/chefRPG/comments/1g12k7z/save_breaking_bug/,Save Breaking Bug,"So I decided to upgrade my restaurant before triggering the critic. After upgrading and setting my furniture, I realize my decor score is really low so I decide to hold off on the event until I can raise the decor. The critic event description says open 10am-6pm to start. So I figure I’ll just wait until after 6pm and then I can still earn some money at night. 

When I open the restaurant the event still triggers anyway and so I exit the game so that I can reload my save. 

The game autosaved right away and when I load into the save my restaurant is empty and none of my furniture is in my inventory in build mode. Everything I had on the restaurant floor is GONE.

Freaking out, I decide to load the save from the morning before I triggered the event and even before I even bought the restaurant upgrade. Surely it should be back to normal.

Load up and walk in to see my Restaurant is normal sized and I got my money back…..but ALL MY SHIT IS STILL GONE.

The I load the third and last save option which is from the last story quest completion, this is like 3 days in the before I made the mistake and I crossed my fingers… and stilllll …in all three of my saves …all my furniture is gone.

Star Stable Online was my childhood when I first discovered the game in 2013 as a boy. 

I love it, its atmosphere, characters and character customization. I was quite active in the fandom back then when I joined a popular Facebook group about this game (I was even marked by a moderator as one of the most active members in his post once). I met a lot of people there, watched the clubs grow and new horses were added like Morgans and Shires. I also remember my first horse I bought was the oldest Jorvik pony.

It was in the summer during the beach festival (or whatever it was called) in 2014 or 2015. I wanted to buy a new shirt for the character as soon as possible because I decided that without it I wouldn't go to the party on my new horse.

I also remember waiting with my internet friends in Fort Pinta for the bus, and when it finally arrived we all went to a coffee shop and discussed various things there. Those were great times. I was the only kid in the neighborhood interested in horses, and this game fulfilled something I didn't have in real life.

Unfortunately the last time I had fun with the game was probably in 2018 or 2019. I think everything changed after that.

They changed the design of the soul riders - and I started to dislike the new ones and it seemed to me that they lost all personality. I couldn't get used to the new environment. But I kept playing, trying to adapt.
I currently don't play the game anymore, I can't bring myself to. Even if I make new accounts or become active on this subreddit it's not the same.

I realized that there is no need to force myself. The game is just not to my taste. I am very happy to see people playing this game and having a refreshing adventure like I did when I was younger. 

It's nice to see the game developing and the fandom growing. I'll probably still check in every now and then for news or other players' opinions. I managed to find a few old videos on YouTube that show the old version of the game.

I wrote this post because I simply wanted to thank the community for these beautiful moments. Even if you don't like the things I wrote here - please understand that I simply have a different taste. I don't want anyone to misunderstand the intentions of my post! I don't mind that someone loves the new version of the game, new soul riders or more realistic horses. Everyone has their own taste and that's beautiful

Just, thank you.

Edit.

The game in 2014 wasn't perfect, there were always people calling each other names in the chat or scaring others in the game. I remember when I was younger and I was playing with a friend in Fort Pinta. Suddenly two girls drove up to us and started calling us names. When we tried to get away from them they started chasing us and laughing at us (we could have just taken a trasnport, but we were just kids, who would blame us for being stupid). 


Such things have always happened. But I think that despite everything the community was more cohesive back then and it was much easier to find someone to play with. Also nowadays I am a bit scared by the ""breeding roleplay"" that I often saw in the global chat even on the smallest server (I recently decided to go to the game for a while on a new account to look around for a while).

In any case, this is nothing new. Weird roleplays have always been there. In the past, you simply deleted the game files and that's how wild horses were created.

1g12b3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1g12b3y/finished_my_first_fast_community_center_run/,Finished my first fast Community Center run,"I saw someone post a Fall 20 Community Center, so that inspired me to try and finish before that. Managed to do it by Fall 9 of year 1! I probably could be done by Fall 4th, but I didn't really invest too hard moneywise and ended up not being able to buy an Eggplant and Crocus, forcing me to plant those even with the crazy luck on Pumpkin + Nautilus + Snow Yam + Rabbits Foot (Calico + Jas).

Here's some thoughts I had as a retrospective.

The main blockers for the run in order were Red Cabbage, Nautilus Shell, Snow Yam and Crocus. Red and Nautilus are almost entirely Travelling Cart luck, Snow and Crocus can be done with Winter Seeds, but there's a small chance you can travelling cart them. If you do, that saves like 5 days.

I thought for the first 15 days, I would need to rush fishing to try and get the bus fixed in time. I managed to do that, and picked up cloth and Rabbits Foot. That was huge, because then I didn't have to invest in Rabbits at all, which meant I could skip essentially 52k on trying to spam out a rabbit's foot. Did it, and got insanely lucky with a Jas pickup.

After this I threw a great run pretty hard. Crocus came to the cart, Eggplant came to the Cart and I just didn't buy it because I didn't put two and two together. I could have sold a lot of junk Friday/Saturday, but I wasn't thinking very hard at that phase. I also spent a lot of time farming Kale, and looking back on it, I think going fast chickens would have probably been a LOT better money + farm xp wise. I'd have to check to be sure tbh. I wanted to go Silo before Coop, but this was honestly a huge loss of time. I should've paid for Hay and just let the chickens eat grass until I got it out.

End of Spring I bought the apple tree a few days late and began building things aggressively. That's when I realized I would probably need to have rain totem and Tiller to be able to cut a few days for the final stretch. Sometime around Summer 15, I had finished making all the required buys for the run, and money stopped mattering essentially overnight. I started floating enough to make buy coffee, way of wind, etc. A Pumpkin + Nautilus appeared on the same day one week before Fall, and Snow Yam on the following Sunday. This is when I started beating myself up for not getting that Crocus + Eggplant earlier on. 

Biggest Changes I would do if I went again?

Bat Cave --> Mushrooms. I cannot stress how hard I shot myself in my own foot not getting that free dehydrator and 42 forage xp every two days... My thinking was a lucky draw could knock out artisan fast, but ultimately I had bad luck. So I lost out on XP and a fast keg. I did manage to avoid buying a pomegranate for the enchanter's bundle, but honestly I think I would have the money if I went Mushroom instead.

Rush Chickens --> I think you should probably be getting the Chicken farm asap. I'm not 100% sure, but I think its possible to get one even going Bus, you just have to be more aggressive about selling things.

Stop hording --> I found a ton of items I thought would be important just kept taking up inventory space all the way to the end.

Don't buy Coffee, or coffee beans ever, the tech is just WAY too late to take advantage of.

IF the opportunity comes up with Emily in the Calico festival, you can get fast Cloth. I sat on this. Instead, you should save Rice for this, and buy a windmill. The Windmill essentially doubles Wheat output, and triples rice output. Rice becomes a no-water crop with decent value if you can get it. This would have trivialized the run, but I didn't realize that until I started milling late Summer and suddenly I had more money then I knew what to do with.

I heard Georgi on a podcast and the things he was saying completely blew my mind. Sugar is good???? I dove in head first. 

Anyway we’re 17 months into “peating” and we look and feel fantastic despite the fact that our youngest rarely sleeps more than 2 hours stretches at night… My wife basically hasn’t slept in 2 years.

We’ve lived in areas that are prone to tornadoes and hurricanes our whole lives so I’ve always been a prepper in my mind but until now I’ve been limited to a small suburban home on a small lot. So we just keep enough coconut oil, sugar, coffee, water (to make coffee), dried goats milk, gelatin, and flour on hand for if/when the power goes out for 5-10 days. 

BUT.

We finally found a big ‘ol’ plot (11 acres) with a turn of the century farm house that we can afford. We’re moving there in February.

Ever since I found Ray’s work I’ve thought of him as a badass prepper. At its heart prepping is just about being self sufficient. Homesteading might as well be synonymous. People think you have to be paranoid and anxious to prepare for the grid going down but in my mind the grid is just a fun luxury we’ve all gotten really used to. People in the 1850’s weren’t all paranoid & anxious because they had no rug that could get swept out from under them. (Kind of) And funnily enough they were all eating pretty much what Ray was eating in the 2000s. 

The point is I think the world of r/preppers could use an intro to Ray because I think his ideas make prepping a) easier and b) more fun. Imagine the grid goes down and you still feel guilty for pouring sugar in your coffee and slathering butter on your potatoes?? That sucks. 

Obviously if you want to be self reliant for months or years you need food. Here are the Peaty things I plan on stocking up on next year:

Condensed milk 
Homemade orange marmalade 
A whole lot of sugar
Potatoes
Carrots
Any jams & jellies we can find
Jars & jars of honey

Also can’t wait to start r/beekeeking, dig into r/homesteading & r/offgrid life with some r/diysolar. What else should we get into?

What do y’all think? Does the RP lens make self sufficiency easier/more fun? 

I’m working on a thesis that if everyone had access to Ray’s work the world would be a better place and I think the same goes for self sufficiency. Life would be better if we all still grew at least some of our own food. Tell me what you think! ",2,1728622993.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

Then HE walked into the coffee shop in which Lily would drink coffee. Lily liked coffee, but in a ""I like coffee, but I'm not a fan of coffee"" way. She was just different like that. She was always different... A white American man, scoff, another one? She thought about how stupid his accent probably sounds. She mocked the American accent in her head: ""I would like to buy a coffee with my American Express card"", she thought to herself, in her head. 

""Hola, me gustaría una café.""-What?! Fluent Spanish?? From an American?! Who is this guy??! His accent was perfect. More native than native. It was a mixture between Vicente Fernandez and Ben Affleck, with a hint of Kendrick Lamar on Collard Greens. Mexican, but with a hint of typical Americana, and a hint of consciousness of the black struggle that only Kendrick could have. 

He sits next to Lily, coffee in hand. ""Hola, puedo sentarme?"" Once again, with an accent better than a native. ""Sí"", Lily responds. ""How long have you been learning Spanish?"" She asks him. He tells her that he's been studying it for 3 weeks now. ""Right."" She says with a hint of sarcasm. She doesn't believe him so she's using sarcasm to show him that she doesn't believe him because that's how you use sarcasm. 

Then bullets start flying and everyone but Lily and Xiaomanyc dies because of the bullets. Xiaomanyc gets up from his seat and smirks. ""Wow, you found me already?"" It was former president Ronald Regan (Southern Stuff by Anthony Hamilton starts playing in the background). “You ain't shit but a bus boy, Xiao. Shii, I been speaking Spanish with a hint of Kendrick Lamar that indicates that I understand black struggle.""

Xiao turns to Lily, ""I haven't told you my name yet."" Lily remembers, he didn't tell her his name at all yet. ""It's Xiao... Xiaomanyc!

But the problem was that we had to get married without my parents present because I kept begging them to give him a chance but they wouldn't because I come from an Arab household and he's a Chinese revert. I told them that it was forbidden to prohibit their child from marrying someone they love but they didn't care so I took my life into my own hands and married the guy I love. But with my mother still thinking im single, she told me a friend of hers is coming to talk to us about something and I just knew it was going to be a proposal and it was. The lady tells me she has a son and whatever and as soon as she leaves, I immediately shut down the idea to my mom and she kept insisting to at least meet him for coffee with her present because saying ""no"" without trying to get to know someone is apparently unethical. I kept rejecting the idea but my dad ""ordered"" me to go so I couldn't really do anything. I tell my husband this and he is fine with it. After I meet this guy I tell my mom ""no"" again and she's asking for reasons and then calls me ""shallow"" because I called him unattractive.

I ended things with the guy right after to not lead him on or give him false hope because after all, I'm married. But my husband doesn't it see it like that, he thinks I enjoyed texting the guy and that I wanted to choose a random man over my own husband. But that's entirely not true.

For example, a single slice of cheese pizza can be around 700 calories—and that’s just a plain cheese pizza! Add toppings, and it shoots up even more.

Even things we think of as “healthy” can be deceiving. A salad with dressing (We love our ranch here in America) can easily be over 500 calories. Fast food meals? Some of those are easily over 1000 calories without even realizing it.

Bagel with cream cheese: Over 500 calories, depending on size. Do 2 bagels and you’re at 1000 Calories already. Add a cup of coffee with some coffee creamer or half and half and good luck, you’re at 1200 and it’s just 9am. I used to do this almost daily at work (free bagels at work lol can’t resist)…

A typical burger from a fast-food joint: Easily 700-900 calories.

Granola bars or “healthy” snacks: Some pack 200+ calories in just one bar! And Granola cereal is just as bad.

I’ve also always heard how some of the ingredients used in American foods are actually banned in other countries, which just makes it even crazier. It’s definitely opened my eyes to what I’m putting into my body and why paying attention to what we eat is so important.

However, I really haven’t talked to anyone meaningfully since May, and I can tell it’s starting to affect me emotionally a bit. As right now, no matter what I’ve done during the day, my nights look/feel the same.

1g11nrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/centurylink/comments/1g11nrz/centurylink_to_quantum_warning/,CenturyLink to quantum warning,"Today has been a nightmare. Will skip details.

What you need to know is that CenturyLink will schedule an automatic disconnect of your service on the day that Quantum should be installed. You will be without any internet and no recourse until the Quantum tech is able to install their things. 

This is especially important to note if CenturyLink no longer services your area. 


Storytime for those interested:
Tech was suppose to be here at 8am, normal text notification, reply saying call me so I can unlock complex doors for them. An hour after the service window I get notification that they are on their way. 30 seconds later am told they are delayed. Call customer service (CS). They tell me they couldn’t contact them but left a message that they should contact me. Great.

CenturyLink shuts off service. Now zero internet. (See previous post that I’ve been surviving on 9mb for a week now)

2 hours later. Call again, am told the tech was called to an emergency call at 11:30. (This would not have been an issue if they were here during the service window) also; let me know if there are service calls before 8am or this PoS didn’t get out of bed. 

Call and ask where tech is since I’ve been provided zero communication. They call tech and no answer and leave additional voicemail. Attempt #1 to escalate. They file elevated ticket and I’m still feeling like they are doing their best. Tell me CenturyLink cannon reconnect service but I don’t follow up since I still have faith in tech showing up.

An hour later. Call, repeat most of above, no contact. Tech tracking system now says “couldn’t find parking” there is ALWAYS parking here. Suspicions of lazy PoS increasing. Frustrated.

Call an hour later, talk to CenturyLink, nothing they can do. Internet has been near unusable for over a week since 9mbps and that’s when you are forced to learn how much apple and Microsoft and every other app are constantly communicating without any user input. Very nice woman at CL calls and connects me with Quantum. He asks for more details, does some things, then is going to call tech and put me on hold. 20 minute on hold and I hang up. Call again. It’s now 6pm.

Same pattern of basic steps to get to “I’ll call the tech” no answer. “I called him 5 times then left a voicemail.” The ticket tracking says he “surveyed” the site and needs a circuit board. 

Should I have been notified that he was on the way? Does there need to be any changes since century to Q is a “rebrand?” This complex has hundreds of people and the law of probabilities rules that at least one other person should have Q. 

Still no call or contact from tech. Is this man still alive? I’d feel bad if there was something tragic but currently without communication I’m just REALLY pissed. 

Will they be here tomorrow? Now that Internet is turned off what do I do to work from home next week if they can’t come out? Bring dog to the coffee shop and crash at friends is possible. But why was my service disconnected before new service was confirmed? Unbelievably poor experience.

Important to note that I’ve had zero issues up until now. So “technically” a 97% up time. But infuriating that CS doesn’t let me talk to any tech and figure out what is actually going on. Why didn’t this guy answer his phone for the entire day and this would be so much easier to plan and adjust for if I had a single detail of ETA. ",5,1728620640.0,centurylink,0,0.86,False

During one of the lowest points in my life—dealing with an abusive relationship, financial struggles, family issues, and the stress of attending an Ivy League school—she invited me to her 30th birthday in Aspen. I didn’t have much money but bought a ticket from NYC to Denver, counting on her for a ride from Denver to Aspen. Last minute, she changed her plans and flew directly into Aspen with her boyfriend, leaving me stranded in Denver. When I finally arrived, I overdrank one night and cried in front of her friends. I apologized, but later, she told me her friends thought I was “weird” and dropped me as a bridesmaid for her wedding. I was hurt but accepted it, though it made me feel rejected when I needed her the most. After that, I felt afraid to be vulnerable around her.

I went to her wedding as a guest, and she later moved to San Diego. I spent three years working as a corporate transplant and eventually settled in Minneapolis. She and her husband bought a house and had a child with a genetic disease that caused blindness and deafness. I flew to San Diego to visit her, spending $2,000, including a hotel since she couldn’t host me. When I arrived, she initially said we wouldn’t have time to meet, but later changed her plans and invited me over. I brought $250 worth of gifts and thought things were fine. The next day, I was at the hotel pool when someone offered me cocaine, and I partook. That night, at dinner with her and her mom, I wasn’t hungry and was a bit “off” from the mix of cocaine and alcohol. She left early for a work event, and when I joined later, I was too chatty and sloppy. I apparently even offered her mom a marijuana edible, which I don’t remember. The next morning, her brother brought me Advil, and I apologized, but my friend was furious and told me I had embarrassed her.

That set the tone for the rest of the weekend. She was cold and judgmental, and I could tell she had spoken poorly about me to her friend. At a barbecue later, she told me she didn’t want me talking about one of my other friends, which felt controlling. I left early, feeling offended. The next day, we met for coffee, where she told me that my behavior would isolate me from others and that she thought I was unstable. She implied I needed to change my ways to have a stable life. I explained that I wasn’t getting married, having kids, or settling down and that I was waiting for a visa to move to London. She found this strange and further proof of my “instability.”

She also mentioned again that her other friends did think I was weird, which felt like triangulation. I didn’t care about their opinions; my friendship was with her. She told me she cared about me but that my behavior stressed her out, and she was losing respect for me. She cried, saying it was too much to handle, given the stress of her life as a new mom. I told her I felt our friendship was one-sided—I’d spent time and money to visit her, and I didn’t think she’d do the same for me. I also brought up how she’d ditched me in Aspen when I needed support. I felt like she prioritized her partner over our friendship, which she couldn’t understand since she’s never been single. By the end of the conversation, I was relieved to leave.

The weekend was tense and toxic. I was having a great few weeks before visiting her, but my time with her in San Diego drained me. I would have preferred a relaxed weekend with her, but it felt like I was constantly overwhelmed by her judgment and engagements.",1,1728620521.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

This is my first haul post and comes super late, but my order took longer than usual to arrive (forwarder's fault, not Alkemia's), and I only received it around three weeks ago. But it was worth the wait!

After letting the stash rest for a couple of weeks, I started sampling them last week, and here are some initial thoughts:

✿ **Offering**

*Fir & resinous woods, offertory fruits, spiced ale, beeswax candles, a whisper of ritual incense, and freshly baked cakes dripping with wild honey.*

This is the first one I tried and I found it just ok. For me, it's mostly smoldering incense and glowing beeswax candles, with a resinous feel. I don't seem to get much more than that or maybe I just need to sample it more.

✿ [**Les Mystères**](https://alkemiaperfumes.com/products/les-mysteres-perfume-oil-black-fig-frankincense-amber-and-russian-tea)

*A resinous opulence of black figs, aged frankincense, labdanum, dark amber, and Russian tea.*

Oooh, this one took me by surprise! At first, I got piquant tea, clean and bare, becoming a little resinous with frankincense in the following minutes. I was a bit disappointed, thinking that that was it, but then the fig slowly emerged, at first a tad savory but becoming sweeter and milkier. And oh, at this point, I really loved it! Different from my usual scents so it comes as a refreshing change. Not at all what I imagined from its name. (Possibly FB-worthy.)

✿ [**Love Unforeseen**](https://alkemiaperfumes.com/products/love-unforeseen-perfume-white-musk-persian-lily-night-jasmine-honeysuckle-tonka-white-amber-soft-aquatics) (free sample)

*A romance of white musk, Persian chandelier lily accord, night blooming jasmine, laleh, honeysuckle, tonka bean, bergamot, white pepper, white amber, china clay, and the silvery aquatics of melting snow.*

Slightly soapy floral, clean yet inviting, pure and sweet. Not my typical scent but I appreciate it very much. I'll be using this sample up.

✿ [**Prairie 66**](https://alkemiaperfumes.com/products/prairie-66-perfume-linden-blossoms-citrus-aldehydes-flowering-sage-concrete) (free sample)

*The smell of an old cement-paved road in the desert just before dawn when the cement is cold and almost, but not quite damp. Flowering desert sage, aldehydes, grapefruit, Linden blossoms, bergamot, saffron, gray amber, yucca, yuzu, and cool concrete.*

Citrus, green, herbal, fresh. It must be the aldehydes that smell like a wide open space. Bright and invigorating. Again, not my typical scent, but refreshing to use on occasion.

✿ [**Come to My Silken Tent**](https://alkemiaperfumes.com/products/come-to-my-silken-tent)

*An accidental encounter of two our cult favorite perfumes - Come to Me and Silken Tent.*

Let me start by saying I've never smelled either Come to Me or Silken Tent, so I couldn't compare. And I can't even begin to describe it but I instantly fell in love with the opening. It reminds me of something that I couldn't put my finger on. Cool and smooth and silky. The strongest note I get is iris or orris root. Soft and buttery, like clean skin. Sweetness emerges as the fragrance settles. I'm partial to these cosmetic smells so this appeals to me very much. I'll give it a try again, but from my first use, I'd say it's FB-worthy for me -- if it's still available when I finally have the budget!

✿ **Misdeeds After Midnight**

*A hedonistic adventure of late night coffee liqueur, white rum, and a splash of creme de bergamot; Black Forest raspberries dipped in salted caramel; and Arabian rosewater infused with vetiver root tumbling wantonly together into a seductive bed of vanilla musk and golden amber.*

A rich, almost sticky fragrance, though not really cloying. I get a coffee liqueur sweetened with salted caramel and spiked with rum. Definitely a coffee scent first and foremost. This one was slightly disappointing because I'd read a rave review and figured it would be just my cup of... coffee. It's actually pretty good but not as wonderful as I'd hoped, especially since I didn't get any of those raspberries or rosewater. But I'll put this away for now and give it another try later on.

✿ **Coconut Alchemy** (gift with purchase)

*Coconut Alchemy, a summer tropical blend of fresh white coconut, sugarcane, baby bananas, tuberose, and gingerflower.*

And finally, Coconut Alchemy, which I'd been wearing since the other day. Due to an obsession earlier in my perfume journey, I already have several (mainstream) coconut-themed perfumes, especially of sunscreen variety. I'd moved on from that obsession and thought this might be redundant or too coconut-heavy (because, the name). Well, boy, am I glad I got this free with my order! It absolutely delighted me from the first sniff!

It isn't just basic coconut. Those other notes also come into play. The coconut is fresh and not dry or heavy. I think it's the sugarcane and bananas that make it smell so deliciously drinkable when I sniff it from the bottle. I don't get much of the floral notes, but maybe they just balance the gourmand quality later on. Overall, it smells like a refreshing poolside drink with just the right amount of sweetness. LOVE!

✿✿✿

I've still to try:

* **Madam X** - *An homage to unsettling, eccentric, irresistible beauty - bergamot, mandarin, dark violet, Italian iris, black orchid, Japanese incense, orris root, sueded musk, white sandalwood, Tahitian vanilla, and pale patchouli.*
* **Gingerbread Alchemy** - *A warm and spicy embrace of gingerbread smouldering with nutmeg, Ceylon cinnamon, star anise, green cardamom pods, and cloves interwoven with sweet threads of black treacle, crystalized ginger, creamy butter toffees, and caramelized vanilla. At the center, a burning heart of golden frankincense and Bdellium myrrh incense rises to welcome the return of the light.*
* **Eggnog Noel** - *A luscious blend of delectably creamy eggnog with nutmeg, cinnamon, and a splash of dark Caribbean rum.*

Sorry for the increasingly long-winded thoughts! I'm not the best at reviewing fragrances and often unsure of what exactly I'm smelling, so these are just my impressions.

I'll try to keep it short bc I'm so frustrated right now. And want to also vent. 

I know the title sounds already messed up but I've really have had it. My bf has brought in 3 stray cats and the first two were bad. They're no longer at my bfs and I know you can't change a cats personality. I've mentioned to him how they're pretry bad and thay if he's going to bring stray cats and have them here chilling for weeks/months he should at least do the basic needs which is clipping their nails, bathe them try to get as many fleas out of them, give them their shots and maybe even spay/neuter them. He did none of that. 

Fast towards a couple months ago he brought in another cat, he asked if he should bring it in and I said idk I can't tell you want to do but you already know how I feel about it. He brought the cat in and I told him the same thing I told him about the other strays and he hasn't done none. 

I am not living with him ATM but will soon and told him I dont want three cats at the place. I have my own cat and he has his own cat as well and on top the stray cat. Reason mainly  why is bc I'm allergic to cats, it's hard to breath at times so I've tried my best to keep place clean and have an air purifier. Two cats is already enough for a small place. 

He says my cat is bad af and yes i know that but I do the basic needs when taking care of my cat. It was difficult getting rid of the fleas she had and when she was finally flea free she got them again bc of the stray cat. I didn't like that, my cat ended up getting sick from the fleas. His cat also has fleas too. 

Now that I'm going to move in with him I told him that and he said okay I'll find someone to take him or something. I said okay, but I keep bothering him about it bc he doesn't seem to want to act on it and do it. Now I'm fed up bc I'm taking care of his cat and the stray and I know my cat doesn't go up on my desk. And his also doesn't of its cluttered. At the moment I have it pretry messy and was studying amd doing my hw having my electronic stuff on my desk and had a coffee also. I didn't think much about it and went to the kitchen and came back and coffee was spilled all over. I was so mad but also glad it didn't get on my electronics. I put him on time out and told him about it and he just seemed unfazed about it. 
I also was going off on him bc I tell him about it and how all the plugs I  have got wet and how my work stuff could've been ruined. I don't have the kind of money to replace stuff easily.

1g11jv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomstories/comments/1g11jv8/haunted_clock/,Haunted clock,"About 5 years ago, my wife and I moved from a small apartment to a large house, and I started buying used furniture on Craigslist and frequenting estate sales to fill our empty rooms on the cheap. 

Before we even moved I found this amazing coffee table on Craigslist. It’s a little over 3 feet square with a very unique design. 

Maybe two years later I went to an estate sale and saw a matching clock. When I say matching, I literally mean that it comes from the same manufacturer, same series, same accents and color scheme, etc. 

Clock came from a huge estate. In my way home I was talking to my wife, who informed me that the reason the clock was for sale is that the previous owners had died in a murder/suicide. 

So we have referred to it as our haunted clock ever since. Last night I was up late in our loft on my computer. The clock chimed 11 times at 11 pm, just like it’s supposed to. But then it chimed 11 times again at 11:20. 

Usually we’re on the second floor or in the basement that time of night so we would not necessarily hear (or notice) if the clock went off at an odd time. 

So now I’m sitting here watching the clock at 11:15 pm to see if it will go off at an odd time again. ",1,1728620235.0,randomstories,0,1.0,False

**The Offer / Reservation Experience**

I received this deal via an email campaign. It came up a couple times in my inbox, and after awhile, it happened to work out with the timing of another trip I was making in the NY area. 

The deal offered a discount (something like $285 total, including tax) for a 3 days / 2 nights stay in NYC. 

The tradeoff? Attend a 2-hour sales presentation on ""Hilton Grand Vacations."" I did some quick googling and decided I was fine with the trade off in order to extend my original trip length.

I received a confirmation email instructing me to call to confirm my reservation dates. I was able to get the dates I wanted to align with my trip dates. 

7 days before my reservation dates, I got another email with a confirmation number and check-in and check out dates. It also shared my sales tour presentation start time and where to go for the presentation. Conveniently, it was located within the hotel (the New York Hilton Midtown).

  
**Checking In**

A few days before, I started feeling inexplicable unease about the reservation. It bothered me that all the confirmation emails I had received thus far seemed to come from Hilton Grand Vacations and not the hotel itself. 

There was nowhere I could look online to confirm the reservation details, except the emails I had already received. The only other option seemed to be to call. The day of, I realized I would be checking in late so I called the hotel in the morning. 

Lo and behold, they couldn't find my reservation. 

The front desk rep I spoke to seemed used to this when I mentioned it was booked through Hilton Grand Vacations however. 

She put me on hold 3 times while she first tried to find it in their system and then talked to her colleagues for help. Finally, she was able to confirm the reservation and add a note that I would be arriving late for check-in. I arrived after 10 PM that day. I had to wait a bit in line, but otherwise had no issues checking in.

  
**The Room**

Given this was a Grand Vacations tour stay, I was hoping they might put in a nice room to help with the overall sales pitch, but I definitely didn't expect the complete opposite - to be treated like an afterthought. 

I stayed on the 13th floor. I get there expecting a clean room and basic amenities that I had gotten at similar rooms in the same class across different hospitality brands including Hilton. Things like a mini fridge, snacks/water (paid or free), room slippers, a welcome brochure and breakdown of hotel amenities.

Instead, I walk into a room that felt like it was barely just cleaned and might even be in the middle of ""refreshing,"" by which I mean:

* There was a notable lack of mini fridge with only a stray cord where something might have been plugged in earlier. 
* The headboard above the bed was ratty and tattered. 
* There was nothing to welcome me to the room. No bottled water, no coffee, no kettle, nothing. (Forget the little above-and-beyond touches I've gotten at other places like little chocolates or a welcome card.)
* The shower tiles felt grimey and the toilet was hard to flush. At least there were towels. 
* The thermostat seemed broken as well.

I felt like I was staying at 2 or 3 star motel instead of a 4-star hotel. 

The only positive of the room is that the bed was decently comfortable. 

  
**Getting To The ""Hilton Sales Club""**

The next morning, I make my way over to sales presentation location. The confirmation email mentioned it would be on the 45th floor. I expected I would simply have to go the elevator and press the 45th floor button.

Turns out, the elevators only have buttons until the 44th floor. From there you need to turn right and walk over to a ""secret"" elevator that takes you to the 45th floor. 

I only find this out because I happen to overhear a hotel staff(?) member enthusiastically talking to a woman also looking to go to the 45th floor for the sales presentation. When he finally pauses enough in his flirting with *(so what do you do for work? oh you work in TV? I just started watching XYZ, have you seen it?)* and leering at her (I am not kidding. The staff at this hotel certainly know how to leave an impression), I ask him for directions and he barely glances at me before letting me in the elevator to the 45th floor as well.



**The Presentation**

I check in with the Sales Club front desk receptionist, who asks for my name and ID. She reminds me to check out later to pick up my gift, then directs me to an area with some refreshments (water, coffee, bars, etc), telling me a salesperson would be with me shortly.

I grab an granola bar and water and sit down on a free couch in the corner.

The salesperson assigned to me walks over and immediately quips about me ""hiding over here in a corner"" with my ""little snack"" - which is breakfast for me, unfortunately. He then introduces himself and leads me upstairs to his desk.

The presentation starts off generally well otherwise. As salespeople are, he has a friendly and outgoing attitude. After a bit small talk about what brings me to NYC, he promises this would take no more than 90 minutes and that they aren't pushy - If I wasn't interested, all I had to do was say no. 

I didn't know it at the time, but this was the beginning of the lies. After some discussion about my travel habits and goals, he tried to get a feel about my pre-existing knowledge and any preconceptions about what he wanted to sell to me. 

Unfortunately for this guy, I know something about sales, psychology and negotiation tactics, and this is a pretty big red flag. As I expected, he asked me to keep an open mind: ""So, <my name>, can you do that for me?""

After putting in noticeable effort to get me to verbally confirm that I would keep an open mind and even asking me to shake on it, he asked me if I trusted to Hilton brand and also stated that Hilton doesn't negotiate; the prices he would share with me during the tour are only valid today. The comment about 'negotiation' struck me as odd, but I simply made a mental note and let him continue. 

Again, these are all common persuasion and sales tactics:

* Salespeople are **trained to build rapport and trust** in various ways, from finding commonalities through small talk and exchanging personal information to using your name and engaging in physically friendly interactions like handshakes
* By **asking me to verbally confirm** various ""statements"" from ""promising to keep an open mind"" to ""trusting the Hilton brand"" he was trying to **set up a foundation for his arguments** that he could use to make me feel **cognitive dissonance** if I later brought out any objections
* By stating that Hilton doesn't negotiate and that prices he would share are only valid today, he was trying to create a **sense of scarcity and urgency** that would act as mental pressure towards his own goals.

Next, he went hard on buttering me up on the benefits of ""buying-in"" - he showed glamorous pictures of travel destinations and locations I could stay at using points. 

He told me a story about a girl named Addison *(who I strongly suspect is not real, or I at least hope is not real... it sickens me to think about this man pressuring a fresh college graduate to buy into this program.)* that used the ""bonus points"" they offered as an incentive to travel  for 6 weeks post-graduation to all sorts of beautiful destinations, describing how her friends were all in awe asking how she was able to do that. 

He also told me about how his dad - who he described as initially a skeptic - had also bought into the program just recently. 

In psychology, this is called **social proof**, *i.e. these people (including someone I personally know and care about) did it, are enjoying the benefits, and you can too!*

Next, he showed me a ROI calculator and tried to use strawman logic to show me how much money I would be saving if I bought into this program... i.e. ""If you travel X days per year with a typical room rate of Y and with room fees of Z, how much does that add up to? Now what if I told you I could cut this in half for you?"" 

Of course, only later did he add in the information about the HOA fees, exchange fees, and roll-over fees for unused points. 

He also tried to tell me I could even earn enough to cover the HOA fees by offering to send friends to travel and charging them at a lower price than other places. My man, my idea of a gift to my friends is not asking them to pay me.

As the presentation went on, he became more aggressive in trying to ""work"" me.

I had been still trying to keep things friendly and polite since I know this guy is just doing his job - then he asked me, **""You got to stay in this hotel at a great deal, when do you think Hilton would want a return on that investment?""** Then he answered his own question: ""Like yesterday!""

I almost thought I didn't hear him correctly. Here was a man not much older than I am, who believes I am a fresh college graduate (an assumption he made I didn't bother to correct), and after asking if I had any college loan debt, tried to guilt me into buying what he was selling*.* Sir, it's your job to make the company money, not mine. I paid the fair price for a promotion that the Hilton brand decided to offer. In what world do you think it's the customer's responsibility to make it worth it for the company to have run the promotion?

At this point the 90-minute mark had gone and passed, and I already have refused the two initial quote sheets my salesperson showed me. So then, he said it was not an issue, and to sit tight while he would get me checked out and on my way. 

He did not get me ""checked out."" 

Instead, he brought over his boss. An older white male. As time went on, their efforts to strong-arm and harass me into giving them money became more and more transparent.

Throughout the presentation, I had made it clear that while I thought the program was interesting (keeping an open mind), **as a rule, I do not make significant decisions on the same day.** 

So at first, his boss tried to ask me how much time I would need to think about it. Depends on the numbers, I said. Then, unable to get a specific answer from me, he moved on to showing me a new quote sheet, with much lower numbers than the first two quote sheets I was shown. He cheekily called it the ""Think About It"" package. 

Remember, when a salesperson uses your own words and language against you, it's just another sales tactic. He stressed how affordable this plan was as a way to ""get your foot into the door."" Then he went into the incentives he could offer me, like 10,000 bonus points, and how I could use those points to travel all these places for fun.

The first time I mentioned my rule to this man, he immediately disparaged it by saying ""*that in itself is a decision.*"" His tone was mostly light and friendly, so I took it half as a joke, though I understand his point. 

However, he missed mine: sure, a rule can be considered a premade decision. And whether you call it a rule, a principle, a decision, or something else, we all have certain things we choose to live by. 

**My rule reflects an intention to be thoughtful with things I consider to be a significant decision.** Whether he failed to understand this or was attempting to pressure me (albeit in a way that backfired on him), after I refused the quote sheet for the third time by repeating my rule, he made the same comment, but this time with a blatantly dismissive and condescending tone. 

I honestly don't know what he was trying to do there - perhaps he thought if he made me feel foolish and illogical, I would reconsider. Perhaps he was simply resentful I did not bow to his pressure.

Regardless, that old man's disrespect towards me left me with a bad taste in my mouth that didn't just reflect poorly on my impression of the Hilton brand and the NY Hilton Midtown hotel, but also ensured I would not be buying anything from him, now or in the future :)

As his boss walked away, my salesperson looked at the quote sheet and whistled. ""Wow, I've never see him give so much before."" I supposed this was a last ditch attempt to make me feel regret, as if I was missing out on something great. Again, sense of scarcity (or FOMO, in colloquial terms). Seeing I still had no interest, he led me back to the couch he found me on originally and told me someone would be over to ""check me out."" (For real this time.)

So as I sat waiting to be ""checked out"", I watched my salesperson lead his next ""guest"" up the stairs to his desk in that open office layout. Funnily enough, I had a feeling come over that I was watching sheep being led into a slaughterhouse. These people were just wolves hoping for a fat dinner. If you weren't willing to pad their wallets with a nice commission, they turned their nose up at you and treated you no better than the dirt underneath their shoes. But I didn't have time to process this further as yet another man entered my view.

Yes, this was the last-chance offer. He said he would just take 2 minutes. He talked about how he, a single dad with a kid, had refused multiple times himself and this offer that he was about to introduce was for people like him that wanted more time to think about it. 

The offer would let me buy enough points for a ""trial run"" with no HOA fees.

It would be good for 18 months.

I said no. 

Finally, I was led to the Sales Club check-in receptionist and handed a ""gift"" of a $100 visa prepaid card.

I think ""bribe"" would be a better word for it.

**Conclusion / Recap**

Since I ultimately did not purchase, I can't comment on the true value of this program, but I can confirm that anyone staying at New York Hilton Midtown should be careful about the sales team there, specifically these two men. They intentionally used dishonorable sales tactics and repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect and care for another individual's life and values.

My salesperson made the assumption that I was a fresh out of college student, and not correcting him, I was appalled to find that he and his boss *(a man old enough to be my grandpa and may have children have his own - but clearly, since I do not look white, he had no issue with essentially trying to give me bad financial advice)* would tell me that I could ""finance this investment with a low monthly payment"" as if they genuinely thought it was a reasonable recommendation to make. 

It's possible for a certain person, this program may be worth it... if you have so much free time, or you are 100% committed to traveling at least X days every year. Compared to a ""typical"" timeshare, this is probably the better deal. Whether that really says much is for you to decide. 

* The program essentially allows you to buy a ""deed"" in the program that translates to a pre-allotted number of points (like a budget) that replenishes yearly or every other year. For example, 25K points every year.
* Supposedly these points have a ""great"" conversion value that saves you money compared to simply spending dollars on hotel rooms each year and are ""inflation proof."" (My salesperson made a point of saying, ""Name one other system that's inflation proof... you can't!)
* You can spend the points to book out vacation dates at various Hilton and partner properties. They will show you a chart that describes point values per night to book rooms based on things like room size (studio vs 1 bedroom) and seasonality (peak vs off season).
* Buying into the program allows you access to an online portal to make these reservations.
* To book with partners, you need to convert the points to the partner currency, which comes with a conversion fee.
* Moreover, after your initial investment to ""buy your points"", you will be on the hook for yearly HOA fees (ranging up to $3-4K on one quote sheet I was shown) for the ""maintenance"" of the properties you now have a deed for.
* There are additional restrictions on when you can book and cancellations, which I honestly do not remember the details of; however, if everything else I have shared doesn't bother you, then you will probably be fine with these restrictions as I remember it being not too unreasonable to work with.
* If you do not use all your points in a given year, they will expire. However, I was told you can pay a small fee to ""roll them over"" to next year. You can also ""borrow"" points from future years at no cost.
* *Disclaimer*: The above information is from memory and was only conveyed verbally. I saw no terms and conditions or legal paperwork. Just quote sheets.

So, I can't comment on how much value you are really getting. Their numbers do not feel transparent (their ""quote sheets"" were pretty laughable - simply a list of bullet points descriptions and numbers, like Closing Fee: $X,XXX) and failed to clearly itemize what you were expected to pay ""today"" as well as how much you were expected to invest overall. 

In my experience, nothing legitimate relies so heavily on tactics that preys on how the mind works. Somewhat ironically, my salesperson also commented that they used to give people ""time to think about it"" and found too many people never got in touch with them again, so now they changed *their rules* and they found ""sales went up like 30%!"" Well, well, you don't say? Now, I wonder why that is...

To be clear, I personally have nothing against sales as a field and have known some pretty decent people who work in sales. The tactics I have described here are not necessarily nefarious in themselves, either. Knowing how to build rapport and trust can be an important skill - even lifesaving in some situations. (Think ""Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz""). However, knowledge is power and recognizing when those tactics are in play will only help you protect your interests. You can always tell whether a salesperson is out to get you strictly for their own benefit, or has basic morals and is looking to create a win-win situation for their customer while making a living.

The salespeople I had the displeasure of talking to at the New York Hilton Midtown were not that.

**TL;DR**

* Be careful about the sales team at the NY Hilton Midtown. **They** ***will*** **lie to you.** On the spectrum of salespeople, this definitely skewed towards used car salesman vibes. In my experience, while they claim not to be pushy, they are some of the worst salespeople I've ever encountered in this regard. They will be doing everything they can to turn your own mind against you.
* Treat and prepare for it like a negotiation (or a game, whatever you prefer). There will be certain ""checkpoints"" throughout the whole process. Decide (1) whether you are going to buy, and (2) under what circumstances before the presentation. **Absolutely** **do not do it during the presentation**. You will be in their 'home court' and at a disadvantage in all aspects.
* I can't personally recommend this as I have not seen any legitimate paperwork (beyond some frankly laughable 'quote sheets'). Still, if you are genuinely interested in this program, would suggest talking to other owners and considering secondhand buying instead.",1,1728620146.0,Hilton,0,0.6,False
