We've discussed a wide array of things like Joe Rogan, mushroom coffee, fitness, diet, etc. 

The session before this last one, I had another attendant who was very rough on me 😂. My chest looked like I had gotten 40 lashes. Anyways, after that session, I ended up having to reschedule this most recent one (which i just went through). What went from a visit every 8-12 weeks turned into over 6 months.

During this most recent visit, I felt abnormally comfortable speaking to her. I felt connected. Like a soul connection. I wouldn't say I'm drooling, but she's the most beautiful soul I've ever met. She's interesting. She seems really smart. And now I'm a session closer to never seeing her again (i live 2hours away).

It's all I can think about and it makes me excited and sad at the same time. On the other hand, it is a customer service business... so im probably over analyzing it... Help 🤣",1,1744340160.0,missouri,0,1.0,False

Very happy with it until 2 days ago when I came home and found water all over my coffee cart and the next morning no water was moving through the machine. 
I dreaded dealing with a perceived hassle of going to some authorized repair place and not having my coffee maker for weeks. 
I called Breville support yesterday morning at 6 am PST and got through fairly quickly, they had me do a video chat to show them what was wrong and very quickly they agreed to send a replacement. I agreed to the option of having a $400 hold placed on my credit card until my unit was returned so they could ship it immediately. 
The replacement is scheduled to be delivered tomorrow morning by UPS. I just find that really amazing and thought it worthwhile to share such a positive customer service experience. 
I could say that it’s the kind of support one should expect for a $1500 product, but that is certainly not always the case.

We are the only company in India that has built a Vision AI foundational model for identifying people and tracking people. Our inference model was built by a team of 2 people. Our total team size is of 3 people.
Our global competitor Amazon GO charges $200K for setup of such a store while we can do it for just $7500(fraction of what it costs).
Yet we lost because we are based in India and Indian VCs are so scared of funding innovation that we will most likely be forgotten.
Some statements made by VCs when we approached them(we have met with almost all of the VCs in India)
1. VC: Indians dont need such stores, qcommerce hai hamare paas.(we have qcommerce)
Us: But sir, costing dekhiye. We can setup small stores across localities and make them a fulfillment centers for qcommerce companies as well without any manpower while also serving walk-in customers who dont wish to pay extra for the convenience.
2. VC: Get $100k to $200k ARR then we can talk.
They are a seed stage VC and talk about backing early founders.
Also we are building in AI with no outside team how do we scale upto there without any backing?
No one has the answers.
3. VC: Dont go for innovation, yaha pe koi paisa nai dega(no one will give you money for this)
Find some service industry and work in that sector. Just drop this.

Our VC sector is built around funding delivery, gashion or makeup, coffee, drinks, shirts, dashboards based services or AI companies which actually work on Chatgpt.
So yeah sorry to say this but Indian startups will never be innovative due to this.
Unfortunately, once we are completely dead Indian companies will tie up with some foreign company(Amazon GO), pay them 10X and say that we are innovating in India.

I don’t expect anything. This isn’t a ploy to win you back or guilt-trip you. This is just me, finally being honest with myself. And maybe, by writing this here, somewhere you’ll probably never see, I can let go of the weight I’ve carried for months.

Green hydrogen hubs, promoted by the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, can facilitate decarbonisation of industrial processes and provide a zero‑emission alternative to natural gas . Carbon capture, storage, and utilisation (CCUS) technologies are being piloted under the European Green Deal to reduce emissions from hard‑to‑abate sectors such as steel and cement .

Additionally, the Biden administration recently extended clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to include marine energy, nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, and waste‑energy recovery, broadening the scope of eligible transitional energy sources . This builds on the Act’s US $369 billion climate investment, which has driven over US $115 billion in clean energy projects and created more than 90,000 jobs in just two years .


---

2. Scaling Renewable Energy
The European Union is projected to install a record 89 GW of new renewable capacity in 2025—70 GW of solar and 19 GW of wind—crucial for meeting its 2030 climate targets and reducing reliance on imported fossil gas . In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has catalysed over US $115 billion in clean energy investments in two years, demonstrating how targeted fiscal incentives can rapidly scale renewables .


---

3. Enhancing Energy Efficiency
The European Green Deal prioritises energy efficiency through updated building codes, retrofit grants, and stricter appliance standards, aiming to cut energy consumption and emissions across the bloc . Likewise, the Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for energy‑saving home improvements and rooftop solar installations, lowering barriers for households and small businesses to upgrade their energy performance .


---

4. Sustainable Agriculture & Land Use
Regenerative agriculture—promoted by the FAO’s Sustainable Food and Agriculture framework—uses practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage, and agroforestry to boost soil health, sequester carbon, and improve resilience to climate extremes . The Rainforest Alliance has launched a US $20 million resilience fund to help farmers adopt these practices, targeting certification of 100 million farmers by 2030 and strengthening livelihoods in key commodities like cocoa and coffee .


---

5. Circular Economy & Waste Reduction
The EU Clean Industrial Deal includes a Circular Economy Act to lower feedstock costs, promote recycling, and decouple growth from resource consumption . Corporate extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes—where manufacturers fund and manage product end‑of‑life—are also scaling globally, reducing plastic and packaging waste while spurring design innovations for reuse and recyclability .


---

6. Policy & Financial Instruments
The EU’s Just Transition Mechanism will mobilise at least €100 billion by 2027 to support workers and communities in fossil‑dependent regions, ensuring a socially inclusive shift to a low‑carbon economy . Meanwhile, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities and the InvestEU programme are directing public and private capital toward projects aligned with net‑zero objectives, with InvestEU’s Sustainability Guarantee de‑risking green investments through EU budget-backed guarantees .


---

7. Community‑Level & Social Initiatives
The Gila River Indian Community has pioneered “solar canal” projects—installing photovoltaic panels over irrigation canals to generate clean power and reduce water evaporation—backed by US $5.65 million in IRA funding . Similarly, Invenergy’s Reactivate program, launched under the IRA, has deployed community solar installations that lower participating families’ electricity bills by at least 20 percent .


---

8. Supporting Eco‑friendly Technologies & Innovation
The IRA’s clean hydrogen production tax credits are spurring development of green hydrogen hubs for heavy‑industry and transport decarbonisation . Public‑private partnerships like the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance—established under the EU Strategy for Energy System Integration—are also mobilising investments in grid‑scale storage and digitalised smart‑grid solutions to integrate variable renewables and bolster system resilience .

By combining these transitional solutions—spanning energy, agriculture, industry, and finance—we can “buy time” to curb environmental damage now, while laying the groundwork for the permanent, systemic changes needed to achieve deep decarbonisation and sustainable development.

1jwfmby,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianstartups/comments/1jwfmby/harsh_truth_about_innovation_in_india_by_an_ai/,Harsh truth about innovation in India by an AI Founder,"Hi, I am a Co-Founder of an Indian Startup which is working on building autonomous stores using Vision AI and Sensor Fusion for 24x7 retail.
We are the only company in India that has built a Vision AI foundational model for identifying people and tracking people. Our inference model was built by a team of 2 people. Our total team size is of 3 people.
Our global competitor Amazon GO charges $200K for setup of such a store while we can do it for just $7500(fraction of what it costs).
Yet we lost because we are based in India and Indian VCs are so scared of funding innovation that we will most likely be forgotten.
Some statements made by VCs when we approached them(we have met with almost all of the VCs in India)
1. VC: Indians dont need such stores, qcommerce hai hamare paas.(we have qcommerce)
Us: But sir, costing dekhiye. We can setup small stores across localities and make them a fulfillment centers for qcommerce companies as well without any manpower while also serving walk-in customers who dont wish to pay extra for the convenience.
2. VC: Get $100k to $200k ARR then we can talk.
They are a seed stage VC and talk about backing early founders.
Also we are building in AI with no outside team how do we scale upto there without any backing?
No one has the answers.
3. VC: Dont go for innovation, yaha pe koi paisa nai dega(no one will give you money for this)
Find some service industry and work in that sector. Just drop this.

Our VC sector is built around funding coffee, drinks, shirts, dashboars based services or AI companies which actually work on Chatgpt.
So yeah sorry to say this but Indian startups will never be innovative due to this.
Unfortunately, once we are completely dead Indian companies will tie up with some foreign company(Amazon GO), pay them 10X and say that we are innovating in India.

I've tried to research how to do this, but I haven't found anything helpful. So what I'm trying to do just for now is input a string parameter into the website, run it through one of the methods in the classes and return it on the webpage, just for now at least. So how would I do this? 

See code below:

1jwfliy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_txt6789/comments/1jwfliy/need_help_should_i_report_my_teacher/,Need help should I report my teacher?,"So today I wrote a math test on polynomials, more specifically factoring and the test had standard of excellence questions which made it 10x harder than our quiz we did a week before. We started writing and the first part was pretty simple it had a couple of questions on multiplying polynomials and a word problem about if someone made a mistake in their solution. Then we come to the factoring part we had 8 questions just straight up factoring and then we had a word problem with surface area and one with one where we had to list all the possible factors for 3 different equations for example find all the factors for a which is an interger (3x + ax + 18) I'm not sure if this one is factorable I made it up just now. Then we move onto our last question the one worth the most marks 6. It was very stupid like calculating the volume of Bob's coffee mug if the dimensions were .... so I noticed a lot of people may have skipped questions and gone to this one. So we were all struggling and then with 15 min left of class my teacher goes to the front and was like actually this is not factorable well it is but you get a very ugly number one that you would get in uni math so he then changes all the numbers in the questions with 7 min left! he then tells us there is 5 min left half of the class is begging for more time because we had to restart but he wouldn't so he took our tests. In the afternoon, I went to complain and say it was unfair that you changed the question with so little time left and said how it was also unfair that you would not give us more time. I also said if people spent 20 min before on that question and got exhausted and frustrated, its not fair that you change it and make it so everyone gets all nervous and stressed with 7 min left. He stated ""I will not remove it or excluded it because the change made the question easier""!

do you think this is fair and if not what should I do?

I've had 2 milk disasters in my car: A fresh milk boba exploded everywhere one time and the other was when my son somehow spilled a travel mug of already curdled milky coffee.

And I'm happy to report that the car smells just fine now.

Here's what we did, after a bunch of research:

1- Soak up as much milk as you can with a towel or whatever.
2 - Spray enzyme cleaner over the whole thing.
3 - Spread a pretty thick layer of baking soda over everything and leave for a day.
4 -Vacuum up the baking soda and start the process over from step 2
5 - repeat as many cycles as necessary, but for us we went through about 4 cycles of this before the smell was totally gone.

I was bringing it over to the coffee table it was very hot and our toddler’s toys were all over the table so I accidentally set it down on a toy and it spilled. It wasn’t such a big deal but he quickly said he could save it and then when he realized he couldn’t he started cleaning it up. I kinda just watched bc it was whatever and I would have just like scooped it up off the table w a pita chip and ate it if it was up to me. He then loudly goes “so are you gonna help me clean it up or not!?” I was like no..? it’s not a big mess, anyway that really pissed him off and he stopped cleaning it and took the baby and stormed upstairs while telling me how pathetic I was and that i could clean it up myself then. 

This also normally happens when he’s putting the dishes away after dinner and i’m sitting on the couch, even tho i made the dinner. He’ll be like “if you’re just gonna sit there go upstairs I don’t wanna see you sitting there while i’m cleaning up”. 

So AITA for not helping my husband clean up and relaxing instead? Any ideas on how to resolve this moving forward? Like the mess will get cleaned up eventually I just don’t wanna do it exactly when he wants it done. ",4,1744338697.0,AmItheAsshole,10,1.0,False

1jwfdun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paramedics/comments/1jwfdun/stroke_call_life_flight_or_not/,Stroke call life flight or not,"69 year old female daughter called the house this morning and did not get a response. Arrived to the house to find her mom on the floor between the couch and coffee table. Sitting up leaning heavily to the left. Slurred speech, unable to lift left arm or squeeze left hand, no movement at all on that side, left sided facial droop. Only sporadically following commands. Last time daughter is sure she was fine was yesterday morning during the phone call. Pt just got out of the hospital 2 days ago for pneumonia. 

So BP 140/95, P 72, R 22, BGL 105, SpO2 96 room air. 

Primary stroke center 20 minutes away (can give thrombolytics)
Stroke center capable of thrombectomy 1.5hours away or 45min to one hour if I call life flight. 

So my question is would it have been better to get her flown to the higher level of care since it was to late for the tPA?
Or is getting her to the CT scan faster worth going to the primary stroke center?

1jwfdpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RawVegan/comments/1jwfdpi/blood_test_revealed_low_potassium_anemia_and_low/,"Blood test revealed low potassium, anemia and low heart rate","Hi all! I have tried off and on to do a raw vegan primarily fruitarian diet and cant hang on for long. Honestly I am really frustrated and confused what I’m doing wrong. I eat a variety of fruit mostly bananas, pineapple, orange and orange juice, and mixed berries. 3-4 days a week I’ll have something like a sweet potato or chickpeas for dinner. Also, I have been self administering intramuscular b12 injections monthly for about 1.5 years now. I keep my sodium under 200mg usually because I don’t see the logic in eating rocks. I was highly encouraged to get a blood test done which revealed low potassium and anemia to my surprise. Also, lately my heart rate is trash when I’m training on my road bike (bad for me is something like 105-120bpm when 138-155 would actually be normal).

I love the way I feel eating this way but I feel deficient so in desperation I’ll eat at the cafeteria where I work and eat a salty meal with some kind of meat, usually red meat like beef, which almost immediately remediates my poor heart rate and I just feel more energetic. 

I sweat a lot, run about 18-24 miles a week on average and roughly 200 miles a week on my road bike and I’m very conscious of how my body is doing. I drink one cup of coffee a day. I would say I feel a little unhealthy at the moment due to these factors but seem to do well for a few days after introducing some meat which I would really rather not be doing from an ethical and health standpoint. I’m assuming that I have iron deficient anemia and the low potassium is tied to low sodium since those two electrolytes keep each other balanced. The heart rate thing seems very tied into this as well.

I’m really frustrated and need some advice from people in this community. I don’t feel like I can ask for advice from my peers or other athletes because I know they would say to eat more meat and more sodium, but I feel like there’s got to be a better way more aligned with non cruelty and a more natural way of eating.

Recently I've decided to go through and listen to various classic pop-punk albums artist by artist. I decided to start with FTSK as they only have three studio albums, so I figured they'd be pretty manageable. I've heard a few songs from their self-titled and J.A.C.K., and thought they were pretty good, so I have high hopes for this album. My review is below:

1. Woah Oh (Me Vs. Everyone) - 5/10. A weak opener, but not terrible by any means

2. Hey Brittany - 7/10. A massive improvement from the last song. Starts strong and ends strong, but that atrocious fucking bridge means I can't rank this higher than a 7. I don't mind heavy autotune (I love Future), but the way it's used here is annoying and hard to listen to.

3. My Worst Nightmare - 2/10. Jesus Christ, what the hell did I just listen to? This was one of the most painful songs of all time. It sounded like if Etienne Sin didn't say the n-word.  This is like Hot Chelle Rae, but missing what makes their music good, and what makes it work.

4. Believe Me, I'm Lying - 8/10. Actually a really enjoyable song. The aggressive autotune actually worked here, and improved the track. Good, but not great. Hopefully the last song was the low point of this album.

5. The Way She Moves - 9/10. A genuinely great song. I've noticed that FTSK always has really strong choruses, even if their verses tend to fall flat. But this one was all around really good. These songs keep getting better and better!

6. She's A Lady - 6.5/10 - pretty okay, I guess. Definitely the easiest song on this record to consume. I can understand why this was the big single from the album.

7. Uh Huh - 3/10. Dammit, I really thought this album was improving, and then this song came on. It had a catchy hook, but that's all the good it offers. This is shaping up to be a very hit or miss album.

8. Phone Call - 4/10. Damn, two misses in a row. This wasn't abysmal, I quite liked the chorus once again, but everything else about this song is just pathetic. This final stretch better be good.

9. Breakdown - 2.5/10. Wow… that was really bad. At this point, not even the good hooks can save these songs from being so unbelievably bad.

10. That For Me - 10/10. This was a REALLY good song. I loved every second of this. The chorus was as good as always, the verses were solid, and the acoustic guitars were finally mixed well. Of course, that probably means the next song will be a 0.

11. Coffee Break - 10/10. Well shit, that was amazing… I honestly have no notes. This song was beautiful and I have no words to describe it

12. Catastrophe - 5.5/10. *Honk shoo, mimimimimimimi… Honk shoo, mimimimimimimi…*

Overall rating: 5/10

Favorites: Coffee Break, That For Me, and The Way She Moves

Least favorites: My Worst Nightmare, Uh Huh, and Breakdown

Final thoughts: While this album had some highlights, I didn't enjoy listening to it. There are only 4 songs on here I'd ever revisit, and my bottom 5 for this album are all atrocious. Hopefully their next two albums are an improvement.",2,1744338351.0,poppunkers,2,1.0,False

1jwfcd7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwfcd7,"[Megapost] The Humanoid Revolution Is Here: 2025’s Top 8 Robots Ranked by Power, Speed, Intelligence, and Market Readiness","It’s 2025, and the future looks like… us.
Humanoid robots have finally stepped out of science fiction and into our factories, warehouses, and—soon—our homes.

We’re not talking about concept art or lab-only demos. These are full-on, production-ready machines walking, running, flipping, and (in some cases) making your coffee. Each of these bots represents years of engineering, billions in investment, and a new race: not just for robotic supremacy, but for the future of work, home life, and automation itself.

Let’s break down the leaders in this high-stakes humanoid arms race and see how they compare across speed, strength, dexterity, intelligence, and commercial viability. Spoiler: this ain’t just a Boston Dynamics flex-fest anymore.

⸻

1. Boston Dynamics Atlas – The Apex Predator

Boston Dynamics just dropped the fully electric version of Atlas, and it’s an absolute beast. No more hydraulics—just smooth, humanlike movement powered by reinforcement learning and Nvidia Jetson Thor AI chips. It’s doing backflips, cartwheels, sorting car parts, and basically showing off.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’8”, 165 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Unreal agility + industrial utility
	•	Use Case: Car part sequencing at Hyundai factories
	•	Bottom Line: Still the most technically impressive humanoid on Earth. Period.

⸻

2. Tesla Optimus Gen 3 – The Mass Production King

Elon’s not just bluffing. Optimus is rolling off production lines, and Tesla plans to ship 5,000–12,000 units this year, with 50k in 2026. The latest version is lightweight, smart, and features 22 degrees of freedom in its hands, making it surprisingly dexterous.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’11”, 103 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Scale + Tesla’s AI infrastructure
	•	Use Case: Factory automation (for now)
	•	Bottom Line: Not the flashiest, but probably the most available humanoid in 2025.

⸻

3. Unitree H1 – The Track Star

China’s Unitree H1 holds the world record for fastest humanoid at over 3.3 m/s (possibly up to 4.3 m/s). It flips, sprints, and ships to customers in 6–8 weeks. If you want a robot that runs like an athlete and ships like an Amazon order—this is it.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’11”, 104 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Speed + availability
	•	Use Case: R&D, commercial testing
	•	Bottom Line: It’s fast, nimble, and you can actually buy one.

⸻

4. Sanctuary AI Phoenix – The Dexterity God

Phoenix may not be flipping off walls, but its robotic hands rival human dexterity with 20 degrees of freedom and actual touch sensitivity. Controlled by the Carbon™ AI system, it can translate normal speech into complex physical actions.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’7”, 155 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Haptic hands + language AI
	•	Use Case: Precision tasks, research
	•	Bottom Line: If hands win the future, Phoenix is already there.

⸻

5. Apptronik Apollo – The Factory Workhorse

Backed by a $350M round led by Google, Apollo isn’t trying to do backflips—it’s designed to do work. It’s being mass-produced by Jabil and deployed in logistics, kitting, inspection, and delivery.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’8”, 160 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Mass production-ready + commercial partnerships
	•	Use Case: Logistics and light manufacturing
	•	Bottom Line: Not flashy, but efficient. The Toyota Camry of humanoids.

⸻

6. Agility Robotics Digit – The Warehouse Specialist

Digit is the first humanoid actually being trialed in U.S. warehouses right now. It has solid battery life, auto-docking, and plays nice with wheeled AMRs. If you’re an Amazon-type operation, this is your guy.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’8”, 143 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Real-world trials + AMR collaboration
	•	Use Case: Warehousing and logistics
	•	Bottom Line: The first humanoid earning a paycheck.

⸻

7. Figure O2 – The AI Whisperer

Partnered with OpenAI, the Figure O2 takes verbal commands and performs tasks on the fly. It’s sleek, redesigned for production, and set to begin alpha home testing in late 2025 with its in-house Helix VLA model.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’6”, 154 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Real-time speech interaction
	•	Use Case: Soon… home and commercial
	•	Bottom Line: AI brain? Check. Muscles? Still developing.

⸻

8. 1X Neo Gamma – The Homebody

Norway’s 1X is playing the long game—building a friendly, lightweight humanoid for domestic use. Neo Gamma isn’t tossing car parts; it’s making coffee, folding laundry, and looking harmless enough to not freak out grandma.

	•	Height/Weight: 5’6”, 66 lbs
	•	Key Strength: Safety + aesthetic + OpenAI backing
	•	Use Case: Home assistant
	•	Bottom Line: A bold bet on humanoids in your living room. Just don’t trip over it.

⸻

Key Takeaways: Where We’re Headed Next

	•	Tesla is winning on volume.
	•	Boston Dynamics is winning on tech.
	•	Unitree is already shipping.
	•	Sanctuary and Figure are bringing the brains.
	•	Apollo and Digit are the blue-collar bots.
	•	Neo Gamma wants to be your roommate.

By the end of 2025, we could see tens of thousands of humanoids in operation—some hauling boxes, some opening doors, and others just quietly vacuuming your floors.

The humanoid revolution isn’t coming. It’s here.

What do you think Reddit?
Would you buy a humanoid robot for your home?
Do you trust Elon to build your butler?
Will humanoids replace workers—or become our coworkers?

1jwfau3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jwfau3/update_i_found_something_i_shouldnt_have_part_4/,[UPDATE] I found something I shouldn't have... (Part 4 FINALE),"I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.



It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.



She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.



I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025



Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least. 



///



February 21st, 2025



My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.



The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

February 22nd, 2025



My dreams were haunted by shadows. Figures I felt like I knew but couldn’t see. They all watched me. Staring. Studying. i woke up in a cold sweat. We were all woken up at the crack of dawn and the entire crew was in the dining area. Nobody mentioned on Captain’s list was there. The weather had calmed and I could hear a helicopter whirring overhead. It sounded close and then I could hear an engine powering down. Within minutes the General who had given us our initial briefing walked in, followed by Captain Downes. Nobody stood up. “You are all here because you can be trusted. The situation that unfolded here is to be referred to as a research study that yielded no results. No more details are to be given. To anyone. Ever.” He said firmly. “You will all be compensated generously for your assistance in this endeavor. As of this moment, this vessel as well as all equipment on it is property of the United States military. Go back to your quarters. Those of you with held equipment will find it returned upon your arrival. You have 1 hour to gather yourselves and report to the helicopter on deck.”



Nobody had time to raise their hand before they both exited the room. On the way back to my quarters, I took a detour outside. I examined the lower deck of the port side. Where I saw Captain last night. A guard was strolling a post up and down the length of the side. I crouched behind a container and moved quickly across the way to the railing of the ship, covered by a staircase. I traced the railing down as far as I could, but found nothing. While turning back around I heard a small clank at my foot. I moved my shoe aside and found a 9mm shell casing. I looked down the length of the deck and behind me and found two more that rolled up against the bottom of the staircase. That was enough to confirm my theory. The curfew. The list. That was the time they executed those who they didn’t think would be able to keep this under wraps. Innocent people who were here a week ago on their own. Researchers. Genuine researchers. Studying the world. Not whatever the hell they got dragged into.



I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be. I’ll figure the rest out when I get back to land. 



………



Same day but last entry. I’m in the lifeboat now. Once I left my room I made my way to the monitoring room. I plugged the drive in and began waiting. It was moving slow. Each increase in completion percentage feeling like hours. Thats when it happened. A guard walked in. The one that barked at us last night on dec to get back inside. “You’re not supposed to be in here!” He said assertively, raising his rifle at me. I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.",2,1744338134.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1jwfasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jwfasy/update_i_found_something_i_shouldnt_have_part_4/,[UPDATE] I found something I shouldn't have... (Part 4 FINALE),"I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.



It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.



She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.



I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025



Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least.

February 21st, 2025



My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.





The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

February 22nd, 2025



My dreams were haunted by shadows. Figures I felt like I knew but couldn’t see. They all watched me. Staring. Studying. i woke up in a cold sweat. We were all woken up at the crack of dawn and the entire crew was in the dining area. Nobody mentioned on Captain’s list was there. The weather had calmed and I could hear a helicopter whirring overhead. It sounded close and then I could hear an engine powering down. Within minutes the General who had given us our initial briefing walked in, followed by Captain Downes. Nobody stood up. “You are all here because you can be trusted. The situation that unfolded here is to be referred to as a research study that yielded no results. No more details are to be given. To anyone. Ever.” He said firmly. “You will all be compensated generously for your assistance in this endeavor. As of this moment, this vessel as well as all equipment on it is property of the United States military. Go back to your quarters. Those of you with held equipment will find it returned upon your arrival. You have 1 hour to gather yourselves and report to the helicopter on deck.”



Nobody had time to raise their hand before they both exited the room. On the way back to my quarters, I took a detour outside. I examined the lower deck of the port side. Where I saw Captain last night. A guard was strolling a post up and down the length of the side. I crouched behind a container and moved quickly across the way to the railing of the ship, covered by a staircase. I traced the railing down as far as I could, but found nothing. While turning back around I heard a small clank at my foot. I moved my shoe aside and found a 9mm shell casing. I looked down the length of the deck and behind me and found two more that rolled up against the bottom of the staircase. That was enough to confirm my theory. The curfew. The list. That was the time they executed those who they didn’t think would be able to keep this under wraps. Innocent people who were here a week ago on their own. Researchers. Genuine researchers. Studying the world. Not whatever the hell they got dragged into.



I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be. I’ll figure the rest out when I get back to land. 



………



Same day but last entry. I’m in the lifeboat now. Once I left my room I made my way to the monitoring room. I plugged the drive in and began waiting. It was moving slow. Each increase in completion percentage feeling like hours. Thats when it happened. A guard walked in. The one that barked at us last night on dec to get back inside. “You’re not supposed to be in here!” He said assertively, raising his rifle at me. I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.",3,1744338131.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jwfarh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jwfarh/update_i_found_something_i_shouldnt_have_part_4/,[UPDATE] I found something I shouldn't have... (Part 4 FINALE),"I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.

It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.

She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.

I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025

Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least.

February 21st, 2025

My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.



The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be.

I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.",2,1744338128.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’ve been working a lot and planning how I divide up my money till summer to pay for this vacation, one with my cousin, and tuition in the fall all while paying off my student loans. 

Now, for a while my mom (56 F) has been supporting me and along the way and I help her with some things too like, buying things online, or suggest what coffee maker to buy, I was also helping her learn more about opening a TFSA. 

Fast forward, my mom’s been trying to put $500 into her TFSA for a while or to open one up. This guy was sus at the bank and wouldn’t take her to a financial advisor and said he could set it up, so she decided not to open it up. 

Moving onto today, April 10th, I just got home, I did my dailies on Infinity Nikki, ate some dinner, showered, and I’ve been exhausted so I took a nap. My mom wakes me up from my nap and says “sorry I didn’t know you were sleeping.” And I say “it’s okay I was just taking a nap.” Not a minute later my mom walks out and I try to go back to sleep and wait for my alarm. 

4 minutes pass, not even my mom comes into my room and hands me a few bills of cash, being groggy, my eyes were shot when I noticed it was 5, $100 bills. 

My mom starts off saying “This is for you, you work so hard, it’s an early birthday present and some money for your trip, this is just from me. I wish I could give you more. You are doing so many things and I’m proud of you. I wish I was as independent as you.” My dad was away for a retirement party. I was chocked up, I manage to say “this is more than ever thought.” 

She gets sentimental and hides her tears but I can tell when she sniffled. My dad just walks in the front doors and my mom was quick to turn her head away from me. When she leaves my room and closes the door I hold the cash still in my hands and I start crying. I knew it was the money that she’s been trying to deposit in her TFSA because it’s the exact amount she’s been holding onto. 

She gets a $40 allowance if my dad been remembers to give it to her a week. More than three months of money saved up, that she wanted to put into her future, her retirement she had given to me. I kept crying because the amount is as much as I get in a paycheque. 

I know my mom really wants to learn and she’s trying her best to learn the things she’s been sheltered from I started crying again thinking about how she wished she was as independent as me. My mom hardly sees me, I’m always at work, with my boyfriend, or at school or planning something with my friends. I haven’t had time before my trip to spend time with her. 

With the money she gave me it can go towards the funds for my trip with my cousin, or I could pay it forward and open a TFSA and give it back to her one day to help my mom retire since she’s been working as a nurse for 25+ years. 

What should I do?

TLDR: My mom gave me $500, I pay my tuition plus still have loans and have two vacations planned for this year. My mom wants to retire, would’ve used the money to open a savings account? Do I put it in a savings account for her to give when she retires or use it for the expenses I have?",1,1744337918.0,family,3,1.0,False

I (27F) have been with my fiancé (27M) for almost two years, our anniversary is in August, and we got engaged last November. I met him after clawing my way out of a deeply toxic, on-and-off relationship that started when I was just 13 years old. That narcissistic relationship nearly killed me. I kept going back, even when he destroyed me, emotionally, mentally, physically. I didn’t think I’d ever survive it, let alone thrive again. But I did.

That relationship wasn’t just emotionally abusive, it consumed me. I supported him in every way imaginable. I worked full-time, went to school full-time, juggled an internship, and still paid *all* the bills because he couldn’t hold down a job due to his “issues with authority.” I got him into college, did his homework, helped him apply for jobs, even got him one at the restaurant I managed at, he ended up getting fired from there too. I didn’t just love him, I *fixed* him. Or tried to.

Then, in 2023, my dad, my best friend, the one person who always understood me, died. I was the one who found him. Two days later, that same ex cheated on me *in our bed* and kicked me out. I spiraled hard. I developed a serious drinking problem and ended up in treatment for mental health, self-harm, and alcohol abuse.

But rehab changed me. I came out stronger. Sober. Clear-headed. For the first time ever, I was proud of myself. I had my own apartment, my own car, my independence. I had friends. I loved my body. I *loved* being alone. I wasn’t chasing anyone’s love. I was finally whole. I managed to stay single for four months without any romantic contact with anyone for the first time since I was fifteen years old. 

And that’s when I met my fiancé.

We met in a post rehab therapy group. He was kind. Grounded. Respectful. He never pushed for anything physical. He made me feel safe in a way I hadn’t felt in years. I'll never forget the way he made me feel just standing next to him... it was like the barrier I had on my heart came off, and I experienced a feeling of safety I had never experienced before.  He brought a steady, calming energy into my life. When he moved in (after months of me asking), it was because he *wanted* to build a life with me, not because he needed saving. He wouldn't even have sex for months because he wanted to build on love instead of lust. 

He came to Georgia from Alabama for rehab, and I helped him get settled. I helped him navigate his legal issues, get back on his feet, feel good about himself again. I never saw him as broken. Just someone worthy of love and a second chance, just like I was.

When he opened up about childhood trauma involving a dog being taken away, we decided to get a dog together, a Frenchie/Boston Terrier mix that would be *his.* We already had my chihuahua, who we both adored. But if I’m being honest… I hate his dog. I know how that sounds, especially since I’ve always loved animals. But that dog has destroyed my peace, literally and emotionally. He’s peed on my furniture, chewed up irreplaceable things, and taken over the one space that used to feel safe. I raised him mostly alone while working from home. Now that he’s older and bonded with my fiancé, I just feel disconnected. When I see them cuddling or playing, I feel resentment I don’t fully understand. But when he does those things with our chihuahua, my heart melts. I hate that I feel this way. Why do I feel this way about *his* dog?

Now we’re getting ready to move to Alabama, *his* hometown. And I’m terrified.

Everything is in *my* name. The lease. The bills. My car, a 2024 Hyundai Elantra, my dream car that I always wanted. He legally can’t be on anything due to his record or we'd be denied. And while I understand that, it’s hard not to feel the pressure of carrying it all. Again.

I’ve done this before.

I’ve moved away from my family before. I’ve isolated myself for someone else before. I’ve given everything, only to lose myself completely. That’s what happened with my ex, who isolated me, cheated on me, abused me, and convinced me that *he* was the only one who cared, while slowly erasing every part of who I was. And now? I’m scared I’m doing it all over again, just with someone kinder.

Right now, my fiancé has been using my car almost every day to get to a warehouse job an hour and a half away. I work from home, so technically I “don’t need” the car, but it was always my one escape. My one piece of freedom. To grab a coffee, meet a friend, clear my head. And now, I can’t even do that. It doesn’t feel like *my* car anymore. And once we move… how will this work? In Georgia, his business partner picked him up every day, so I still had access to my life. But in Alabama? Is the plan really for him to just keep using my car every day while I sit alone, isolated, again?

I don’t want to sound ungrateful. He’s not like my ex. He’s not controlling. He’s not abusive. He listens to me. He encourages me to reconnect with the things I love. He works hard. He’s taken a massive pay cut just to help us with this transition. And he’s *been there* for me in ways that truly matter. He’s held me through breakdowns, through moments of self-harm, through nights where I didn’t think I wanted to be alive anymore. He’s seen the darkest parts of me and stayed. He tells me I’m beautiful when I feel disgusting. He’s patient. He loves me.

But still… I feel lost.

I’m not sober anymore. I’ve gotten into harder substances. And that scares me more than I can even admit out loud. I don’t recognize myself in the mirror. I’ve gained weight. We haven’t had sex in months. I feel numb. Disconnected. I miss the version of me that was vibrant and full of life. I miss the early days of our relationship, when things felt easy and full of laughter and love and passion. I miss *us*.

I don’t even know what I’m asking for. I just know that I’m scared. I’m scared I’m repeating the same pattern... taking on more than I should, fixing, supporting, giving everything while slowly falling apart. I don’t want to wake up a year from now with no car, no friends, no sense of self… just a whole lot of love I don’t recognize anymore.

I love him. I do.

But I’m scared. And I just want to feel okay again.",1,1744337626.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

“I don't even remember what was before. Day after day, always the same. Only thing I remember is the taste of them boiled leaves. This pungent sweet taste, everywhere. Them was good times. Before all... this.”

*\~ Rhodey Charl, sky crane operator, Gaia City*



The air was… uncomfortably cold. Arthur couldn't explain it, not logically at least- the Hab Zone on Persephone was tropical, hot, with sweat bleeding off skin. And yet… it was cold. The street was filled with garbage, old, used hab-tubes with rotten rations, per-rats scurrying around, looking for food. Nasty little creatures they were- hard to describe,  as if a cursed hybrid of a rat and a bat from Earth. They generally left you alone, unless you threatened their food sources. Arthur saw more than enough people with their eyes peeled out because of a per-rat. It was… nasty. But it was also real. This wasn't Earth. There were no force walls with advanced AI guardians that shot down any sign of life that dared come near. Here, local life and the colonists were one and the same- tired, scurrying around, trying to survive on this thin piece of land surrounded by ice and fire.



Arthur turned around as he felt someone grab his arm. It was one of the street kids- disheveled, dirty, his feet burned with greenish cracks- he probably wandered into an  acid spillage somewhere. ‘Poor thing’, Arthur thought, and handed him a ration token. It would only get him a leaf stew, but food was better than none. It would only last him half a day. But here, every hour lived was worth fighting for. Or so he told himself. The kid ran away with the token, and Arthur sighed. He despised the stew, they all did. It was unsettlingly bland, yet so pungently sweet, almost like sugar and water. But… different. Alien.



Arthur walked through the street, clenching a card in his hand, pressing it against his palm. The pain helped ground him, focus his thoughts. He waved to a vendor close by. It was Agitha, an old lady who dealt with trinkets and random tech pieces, most of them fried before use. She… wasn't right often, mumbling to herself often about her daughter who was left on Earth.



‘Oi, Arthur. How’s ye kid?’ She’d ask in a thick accent



‘Little brat’s not listening to his pap as usual, you know how he is’ He said, chuckling



‘Aye, I know. I heard they took power out yesterday in Hab 4, damn bureaus. Ye want yer usual?’ She gave him a cup of coffee. Well, it was hard to call it that, it was a combination of leaves, roots and probably a nasty acid, but it worked. Coffee was no longer a thing. Not here. She smirked.



‘And give ‘em hell’ She said, knowing well where Arthur was heading. He gave her some metal shavings for the cup, and nodded. He knew she knew.

The road was slowly getting cleaner, the air brighter, until he walked to the Council Building. It was so… suffocatingly bright. The marble was so white it could almost be made out of Glist. The veins migrating in it like rivers of gold and crimson, screaming wealth and purity. It even smelled wrong, the air vents giving off this pure, tasteful smell with a hint of chemicals. It wasn't right, it never was. But he went in all the same.



Segwerth noticed Councilor Arthur Telmane enter the Council chamber, and noted it on the datapad. It was still before noon, but the Council chamber was already mostly filled, except for the few corporate representatives who were always late regardless. He looked up from his stenograph, feeling someone’s eyes on him.‘I hope them old idiots treating you well?’ Arthur ask, looking at Segwerth.



‘Oh yes sir, can't complain, doing my best. Though between you and me, Kant could cut it a little’ he chuckled. Arthur pushed Aldiwa to make Segwerth one of the Council stenographers. It wasn't the Academy, but the kid was brilliant, he deserved better than the streets.



Arthur looked at the young stenographer appreciably before turning to the Council table. The chairs were unmarked, but he clearly knew who took which- Gaia Corp, Nuclear Org, Kant, the Academy, security, and… him. ‘The People’, he was supposed to be the voice for… who the very same were starving in a queue waiting for jungle leafs. Before he could sit down, a voice came from behind him. Deep, pretentious, charismatic. Of course it was Behelath Kant.



‘Ah, Telmane, good to see you! Didnt get eaten by the rats yet?’ He asked, smirking



‘Kant’. Arthur looked the man up and down. Tailored black suit, white gloves. Almost like he wanted to scream ‘villain’. ‘I see you didn’t get chugged outta an airlock’



Kant kept his smirk, if something seemed to change in his demeanor.



‘Gentlemen, if you’re done exchanging pleasantries, we have business to attend to’. That was Georgia Aldiwa, the Nuclear Organisation Corporation CEO, and chair for the meeting. She was an old woman, nearing the end of her sixth decade. Unlike Kant, Arthur had a degree of respect for her, making her way up from a security grunt to one of the most powerful people on the planet… Earth, that is.



The gavel banged, and Aldiwa’s voice boomed above others, amplified by a holospeaker.



‘The Council is called to order. Councilors will take their seats’. The table filled in shortly, Aldiwa taking the elevated chair. To her left was Director Chirana from the academy- a younger woman with a spark in her eyes, the only reliable ally on the council that Arthur could (mostly) count on. Next to her was Kant, smug as always. Then Rathan, the security rep- always quiet and reserved, rarely spoke unless it came to security matters. And finally, between Rathan and Arthur, Cecilia Yornes, CEO of the Gaia Corp. Dressed in her usual vibrant green, she could as well be an aposematic frog. She would side with Kant as usual.



The gavel banged, with the shades lowering over arched windows, covering the hall in almost complete darkness. The holograms flickered, showing the day’s agenda in front of each councillor. Aldiwa’s voice boomed slightly, dominating the room.



‘The Council is called to order. I am opening the hundred and first session of the Council. The agenda for this session has been provided to members with earlier notice. Without objections, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing none, the agenda is hereby adopted.’ The gavel banged again.



‘Hundred and first… and we’re still behaving like its day one on Earth’ Arthur murmured to himself, too low for anyone to hear.



‘We will begin with item one, submitted by the Academy- ‘Resolution G/101/753/4 titled ‘Reconsideration of Viability of Continued Operations of Sky Infrastructure New Berlin, Pluto City and Amara City. As provided by the Academy in its proposal- The three Special Sky Infrastructure Projects, commonly called Sky Cities. These projects now consume twenty-three point four percent of our energy reserves, and necessitates constant retention of over two hundred and fifty workers to maintain them. Only yesterday, Habitat 4 was denied its energy allocation quota for most of the day to power the transfer of New Berlin from Chahara Peaks to the Northern Falls, serving no purpose but to change scenery while depriving almost 500 people of basic energy necessities. Given this state of affairs, the Academy proposes to reconsider the viability of said infrastructure and to consider scaling down of its operations or, if necessary, planned shut down. End quote. The floor is now open for statements.



Kant rose first. ‘Madam Chair, I’d believe it… short-sighted to even consider this proposal. Have we forgotten where we come from? We did not grow on this earth, ladies and gentlemen. No, we *descended* on it. From the skies, from which we came as saviours and heralds of civilisation. And those cities? They are not just the reminder of our power, but of our resilience, and our true home’. His tone seemed stoic, if the hint of surety and snarkiness was easily detectable. One of his hands remained buried behind his back, while the other supported itself on the table- a classic sight of megacorp meetings, silently saying ‘I’m in charge, and you’ll listen’.



‘Did we move New Berlin? Yes. But it was not merely for ‘scenery’, as our good Director claims. Its for the soul. For art, the mind, for new perspectives. Would you have us stifle that? Be emotionless ground-pounders with no ounce of self respect or deeper purpose? We cannot have that. The sky must keep high, lest we forget we came from them. And then, we'd be no better than apes, and two and a half thousand millennia of civilisation would crumble to jungle leaf and ceramite ash’



Kant straightened, locking eyes with Arthur for a moment. ‘Kant group moves to table this resolution and refer it to a subcommittee before it can be reviewed properly taking all actors into account.’



Aldiwa rolled her eyes quietly. The procedure was possible from a legal angle, but no committees existed since the Fire. If the vote succeeded, the bill would fall into the legislative freezer for… who knows however long.



‘Kant Group called for the tabling of Resolution 753/4. Councillors will kindly signify their votes on the holo screens.’ Aldiwa announced, pressing the voting button, and screens changed to grey. One by one, the screens filled up- Academy’s was red, as was Arthur’s, Kant’s in bright green. Almost reluctantly, NOC and Security’s screens filled yellow, and finally Gaia’s, also in lemon. 



‘The voting ends with one vote in favour, two against, and three abstentions. Therefore, the motion fails. G/101/753/4 remains on the floor. Counsellors may produce their statements.’



Arthur rose from his seat, nodding to the Chair. His hand disappeared behind his back before producing a small, red paper book, not much larger than a palm of his weathered hands. He let it drop on the table, the quiet *thump* echoing across the chamber. He licked his index finger, opening the book at a marked page. That it opened without crumbling into dust was an accomplishment in itself; Arthur took a deep breath, locking eyes with Kant sitting across the table.



‘Power exists in a vacuum, only insofar as those subject to that power continue believing in it. From the moment that belief dies or is suspended, the power-wielder finds themselves at the mercy of their subjects... all too often too late to realise so. Letters from Kuala Lumpur, 2099. None of my colleagues, I assume, are aware of the author. Well, neither am I, because they died under a hail of smart bullets in the Malaysian Intervention. You see, Counsellor Kant, but you don't have smart bullets. Or immersion chips, or battlecruisers. You have… you. You and your band of deluded corporatists who still pretend it's 2300. But no, Counsellor Kant. Its 2326. Let me say it right here, right now, in plain words-



 Earth. Is. Gone’Kant seemed slightly uncomfortable, his eyes still locked with the old man’s, but a barely perceptible, fearful twinkle behind those bright emerald orbs betraying him. Kant shifted in his seat slightly, his eyes darting to the stenographer for a brief moment. Arthur continued.



‘There’s no more corporations. No more benefit packages, conscription lotteries, NDAs signed under a gun’s barrel or Corporate Exclusionary Zones. There is just… us. You, me, and every person in this room and on this damned planet.



Arthur was becoming visibly agitated, stumbling over words occasionally



‘You cling to reality that no longer exists. You moved an entire fucking city for ‘the soul’? Guess what, Kant. The soul doesn't feed, art doesn’t maintain power grids, and shareholder meetings no longer dictate the future. You fuckers get clean air and ravioli. We get them boiled jungle leaves. But you know what? You no longer have corpo security. If we stop, your skies fall. And I think no one wants that…’



Silence filled the room, each of the six faces illuminated only by the dim light of the holoscreens. Kant raised a finger, hanging it above the holospeaker button, disappearing again under the desk. The entire room seemed eerie, if not for the slight nod of approval from Rathan, which Arthur almost missed. Yornes was suddenly very interested in the gems of her brooch, while Chirana seemed to simply stare into nothing. Arthur sat down with his weight on the chair, almost throwing himself on it, a vessel empty of emotion which just hit his corporate counterpart. An uncomfortably long second passed before Aldiwa took back initiative, banging the gavel three times.



‘The session is suspended. We will reconvene tomorrow at 1100 hours. Her eyes gave away a combination of exasperation and quiet approval, but also seemed to tell Arthur ‘please, don’t do that again’.



Before the curtains rose, Arthur was out of the building, the familiar sickly sweet smell of boiled leaf stew hitting his nostrils.

Sudden extreme emotional unavailability

Hiya there!

So this might be somewhat of a long one, but I need to share, because I'm having slight trouble sleeping and sometimes focusing on things.  


So a couple months ago I started a new job, part-time, at a beautiful location, as a gardening-helper. I was coming out on top of a long depression, feeling better than a looong time. After working there for a couple weeks, this woman(32) started coming my way to talk, asking for help etc. I thought nothing more than ""Man, what a kind soul she is!"" in friendly terms. I'm 29 and don't think all too highly of myself, so the thought of her having any romantic interest didn't hit me then.  


As time went on, she became more and more interested in me and in sharing everything about herself, all the deep stuff about her past, her family issues, her diagnoses (ADHD, Emotional Dysregulation, some ASD), and we related on so many levels, views, values, feeling very sensitive etc.  
So then she asked me out on a walk (We live in the same city), and I was still under the impression this was just friendliness. We had an extraordinary chemistry, and we both agreed there. Nothing fancy happened here, although I started feeling kinda sparkly aswell at this point.  


She then invited me out again, on another walk, another place. Same story, everything was amazing, we had coffee, sat on a bench(not for long since, she told me, she felt so excited she couldn't stay still for long, which I adored♥), and had some very long lasting eye contact, with which she told me many times she has issues in general. After this walk, she texted me that ""You know, I'm very open to this turning into something more sometime, have you had those thoughts at all?""  
I was completely baffled.  
I told her ""Of course I've had the thought, it's impossible not to when you're that kind, and as beautiful as you are"" but explained how I've been single for the past couple years, and kinda scared of dating because of being in a bad place. She was totally okay with all the details of my bumpy road of a life, extremely accepting and always trying to positively compare her story with my own, assuring me that it's completely fine and that she'd take it slow if that's what I needed.  


A couple days later, she invited me to her place(she lives alone with her cat), - We'd come to the conclusion that she had to do the invites, since she often has a hard time with overstimulation, and I was all fine with that - we had coffee, sat on her couch, getting closer, until I couldn't hold my growing feelings in and blurted it all out. Something like ""I've fallen flat for you, and regardless if you feel the same, I just needed to tell you""  
She reciprocated and got very emotional, saying ""I feel the exact same way"", and started crying slightly, happy tears. We started making out, talked feelings, got our fears out in the open(for example that she really wanted to go further but was afraid this would end like all her other relations), just cuddling and being all kinds of cheery. Classic.  


We went to her place, went for walks and were like this for a couple more times, just had a warm, nice time together, connecting more each day. She would occationally need alone time to recharge, of course, and I met that with understanding, respect and a wish to learn more. We both agreed that neither of us want kids, we both wanna live alone, and not seeing eachother every day is all good. We also shared eachothers wishes for this relation, and we both wanted to enter a relationship together, but with solid boundaries for alone time on both sides.  


 She's told me she has a deep rooted sense of feeling ""unwanted"", reason being all her previous relations were ""sex relations"" where the guy would have zero feelings, but she did, and then she felt like she had to have sex with them to make them get feelings for her too. All these relations she ended herself. I've told her several times I really like her and already care about her as a friend, and feel at home in her company, and she told me she felt/feels the same.  


Here comes the tricky part - she had a 2 week travel-vacation coming, going alone with a group of strangers her age, and back when she booked it, she was as single as can be, and hoped to find love on that road. She began feeling worried that she couldn't enjoy that travel if she got too committed to ""us"" this early, but said she absolutely wanted to see eachother in the future, going as far as making a ton of plans(cinemas, walks, ziplining, small travels etc).  
She told me she had to feel ""free"" on that travel, or she would hyperfocus on ""us"" when away, not being able to be present on the travel, and wanted to cut contact a bit, the days before traveling. We limited contact a bit for the next days, but then she told me she missed me too much and invited me over again, saying she felt overwhelmed by the thought of traveling regardless if we saw eachother or not.  


A couple days after this, she (what seemed to be out of the blue) wrote a long text, saying ""Sorry for my avoidant behavior, you deserve better / I feel trapped in this / I can't handle the situation we're in now, I feel overwhelmed / I want to go back to the two of us being just colleagues / I wish you the best, and don't let this hold you back!""  


I was confused, sad, frustrated and all that. She's traveling today, and she wants to be left alone, but wants to talk about the possibility of being friends when she gets home. I've said that I'm sorry she feels like that, I never wanted her to feel trapped, I really care about her as a person, and respect her decision,, I'm here if she wants to talk when she's back, and wishing her a fantastic holiday. That's the last we talked ( a couple days ago), and I've since left her alone, social media, messages and all, and she unfollowed me there aswell.


I've been through this hurdle before, so I know to focus and work on me, try and let the situation be, respect her choice and just live my best in general, as I normally do., though I still can't help but think of it all, and feel a slight sadness about having to let all of it just be.  


I know it's dumb to theorize things, and I hate myself for it, but I can't help thinking she broke up as a last resort means to force herself to feel free and stop hyperfocusing on/getting overwhelmed by ""us"", while traveling.  


If she wants to talk, I'll let her come to me at her own pace. I wont bother her or ask her to explain anything. If she doesn't wanna talk at all, I won't force it.  


What's happening here, is she completely serious about wanting to go back to being just colleagues after the amazing connection we both agreed we had? Did she actually just lose interest suddenly ( I know focus and interest is a lot different with ADHD and understand that this could be part of it )  


If you got this far, mercy on your soul, you are a patient individual. ♥  
Answers are severely appreciated! But also I just needed to get this written and out of my system :D  


Just for the record, I'm diagnosed ADD myself.",0,1744337329.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

# WeatherGuard Floor Mats (2025): best Options Compared & Reviewed For Commercial Use!

Protecting the floors of your commercial vehicles is an essential investment, whether you manage a large fleet, operate as a contractor, or run a transportation company. The right weatherguard floor mats can significantly extend the life of your vehicles' interiors, reduce cleaning time, and even contribute to a safer working habitat. In this thorough guide, we'll delve into the best weatherguard floor mats available in 2025, focusing on options specifically designed for commercial use. We’ll consider the needs of fleet managers, contractors, transportation companies, and government agencies, ensuring you find the perfect solution for your unique requirements.

## Understanding the Importance of High-Quality Commercial Floor Mats

Before diving into specific brands and models, letS discuss why investing in high-quality commercial floor mats is crucial. For businesses, vehicles are more than just transportation; they're tools that contribute directly to revenue generation. Think of the daily wear and tear they endure:

   **Exposure to the Elements:** Rain, snow, mud, and road salt can all wreak havoc on your vehicle's flooring. All weather floor mats are designed to trap these elements, preventing them from seeping into the carpet and causing damage.
   **Heavy foot Traffic:** Commercial vehicles often experience significantly more foot traffic than personal vehicles. This constant wear can quickly degrade the carpet, leading to unsightly stains and even structural damage.
   **Spills and Accidents:** From coffee spills to accidental leaks of oil or chemicals,commercial vehicles are prone to various mishaps.Waterproof floor mats protect against these incidents, preventing permanent stains and odors.
   **Resale Value:** Maintaining the interior of your vehicle is crucial for maximizing its resale value. By investing in durable floor protection, you're preserving the vehicle's condition and ensuring a higher return on investment when it's time to upgrade.

   **Material:** Rubber floor mats are known for their durability and resistance to water and chemicals. TPE mats offer a good balance of durability, flexibility, and affordability.

   **Ease of Cleaning:** Opt for easy clean floor mats that can be quickly wiped down or hosed off. This is especially important for vehicles that are frequently exposed to dirt, mud, or other debris.
   **Price:** Floor mat prices can vary significantly depending on the brand, material, and features. Consider your budget and prioritize the features that are most important to your business.
   **Commercial Search Intent:** For commercial buyers, several things will be considered suchs as bulk purchases, durability, long-term cost savings, heavy-duty protection, easy cleaning, resistance to specific materials (oil, chemicals),waterproof and moisture protection, custom fit or semi custom options, compliance with regulations, competitive pricing, high durability, anti-slip properties, resistance to staining disposable floor mats, low cost, high quantity.## Top WeatherGuard Floor Mat options for Commercial Use in 2025

   **Contract-Specific Floor Mats:** Some manufacturers offer floor mats specifically designed for government contracts. These mats may meet specific requirements for materials, durability, and safety.

### Factors in Specific Scenarios for Commercial Vehicle Owners/Operators

Commercial Vehicle Owners who operate in specific scenarios such as a construction site, may want to opt for heavy duty floor mats while those operating more in ""office-like"" environments such as airport transport, may want to look into all-weather floor mats.
The goal here is to protect the floor from liquids, damage and dirt. this would require looking into floor liners, all season floor mats, and stain resistant floor mats.

## Installation and Maintenance Tips

Proper installation and maintenance are essential for maximizing the lifespan of your weatherguard floor mats. here are a few tips:

   **Installation:** Before installing your new floor mats, thoroughly clean the vehicle's floor. Remove any existing floor mats or debris. If you're installing custom fit floor mats, carefully align them with the contours of the floor and press down firmly to ensure a secure fit. For universal fit floor mats, trim them carefully to achieve the desired fit. Search for floor mat installation guides for the vehicles/floor mat types.
   **Cleaning:** Regularly clean your floor mats to remove dirt, mud, and other debris. For rubber floor mats, simply hose them off with water and use a mild detergent. For carpeted floor mats, vacuum them regularly and use a carpet cleaner to remove stains. Always allow the mats to dry entirely before reinstalling them in the vehicle.
   **Inspection:** Periodically inspect your floor mats for signs of wear and tear. Replace any mats that are damaged or worn to prevent further damage to the vehicle's floor.

## conclusion: Investing in the Right WeatherGuard Floor Mats

1jwez2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1jwez2c/list_of_things_i_like/,List of things I like,"This is just a list of things I like. I'm doing this primarily as a way of getting to connect both with myself and people better. If you have anything you like, feel free to share it with us in the comments. 

Here are some of the things I like, limited to 10 per category: 

Food/drink: 

-Turkish coffee. Making it makes me feel like Walter white. 

-Tea. Black tea, Earl Grey specifically is my favorite, but I like it in most forms. Not a fan of bags though, pot brewed supremacy. 

- Pomegranate paste/sauce. Preferably with the seeds also mixed in. 


-Warheads. Sometimes, just sometimes. 

-Most nuts, as long as they aren't sweet. 


-Nectarines. 

-Pomegranates. 

-Feta cheese with olive oil and maybe tahini. 

- Stupid awful tasting licorice 

- Carrots 

Smells: 

-The smell of a hotel room you just checked into. 

-The stuff they use to make soap smell like watermelons 

-Rain 

- The smell of cold moisture from my AC 

- Magnolias

- Those wallets I found at a bookstore once that smelled heavenly for some reason, could not identify what the scent was. 

- Warm bread

-Cooked rice. 

-My Dad's cologne 

- The smell of liquid nitrogen on your bags after you get them back from the baggage claim at an airport. 

Textures/sensations: 

- The way 5-o-clock shadows feel on the tip of my nose 

- When you give someone one of those perfect smacky handshakes 

- Very lightly pinching soft squishy things - like the skin on someone's cheek. 


- When you relax your body and your buttcheeks and tummy sorta get tingly 


- Feeling your eyeballs and teeth vibrate as you say ""mmmmm"" with your mouth closed. 

-Mechanical things I can play around with

-The tingles you get in your body when the plane you are on suddenly drops altitude 

- fistbumps 

- I had this one friend that was hella good at cracking your back - that feeling when you feel like 10 of them pop. 

- Feeling the frozen cream bits from certain types of ice cream melt in your mouth. 

Experiences/emotions: 

-Hugs. Could also count in the previous category. 

-That feeling you get when you see someone with glasses for the first time. 

-Making a joke that lands juuuust right. 

-When you make someone happy anough that they cry. 

- Having a teatime with this one friend of mine. I'd bring tea with me and we'd poor his coffee powder into our cups of tea like the dumbasses we were and still are. 

-Long ass 10 hour flights when you're going on vacation and you can watch like 4 movies on the plane. 

- Being able to look at someone in the eye and not having to worry about being too intense. 

- Not giving a sh*t. Sometimes. Just sometimes. 

- When you investigate and correctly conclude something you weren't told about. If someone makes a mistake that gives you info, as long as you don't abuse what information you've gathered, it's your call on how deep you wanna go. 

- When you sorta freak out about something and it kinda just sorts itself out. 

Here's one thing I don't like: 

- Always being too afraid to get to mutually know someone well enough so that I can tell them all of these things. 


Thank you. 
Ta-ta.

1jwewdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jwewdq/coffee/,Coffee!!,"Coffee has been my great escape from junk food, and i’m so grateful. i just recently came off of seven months worth of a diet, successfully dropping 45 pounds, but I came to an abrupt stop when life started lifing and things became a little stressful with me being in between a career change and a few unfortunate deaths surrounding me and my partners lives.. I found myself going a whole month without maintaining my diet and gained back 10 pounds. now, it most likely is water weight and most likely has to do with me skipping the gym for a month , but due to those factors, i’ve had a very hard time readjusting and getting back on track..on top of that, i now work a late shift at my job (getting off at 1 am..), making it a LOT harder not to eat past 8 pm and not binge/snack every two seconds.. i felt miserable and was scared i’d go back to the way i used to be.. but i had this sudden idea to start drinking coffee as a substitute for snacking on junk. I get one large black coffee and add half-and-half with Splenda or whatever 0 cal sugars are available. thankfully it’s been helping me suppress my appetite. I know some people aren’t too keen on coffee because they don’t enjoy the taste, but there are so many different ways of flavoring it without making it unhealthy. so far it’s been helping me for a good two weeks! I’m back to staying within my calorie limits and I’m still involving a lot of water intake so it’s honestly been a life saver. i hope this helps someone struggling with binging/eating as a distraction🙏🏼

## Key Features Analysis

The most crucial aspects of⁢ a power bank with an AC outlet are its capacity, power output, portability, and safety features. Below is a ‌breakdown of ⁢these key features.

**Battery Capacity:** A power bank's ⁣capacity, measured in ‌Watt-hours (Wh) or milliampere-hours (mAh), determines ⁢how many times it can charge your devices. Larger capacities allow multiple charges or sustained power for devices like laptops.
Choosing the⁢ right capacity depends on your needs. ⁣Do you primarily need to charge your smartphone multiple times, or do you need to power a laptop for ⁢several hours? Look for power banks with a considerable Watt-hour (Wh) rating to ensure sufficient ‍power for your devices. Power banks exceeding​ 100Wh⁣ may have restrictions on airline travel, so ⁣consider this factor if you ⁤frequently fly.

**AC output Power:** The AC output power ‍determines ‌which devices the power bank can effectively power. Measured in Watts, this specification indicates⁣ the maximum power that the power bank can‌ deliver through⁣ its⁢ AC outlet.
Laptops, as a ⁤notable example, typically require between 45W and 90W, while smaller electronics like cameras might ⁢only need a few Watts. verify that the power bank's AC output is sufficient for the devices you intend to use with it. Exceeding the power bank's AC output can lead to damage ​or malfunction. Surge protection is also important to consider, as some devices may draw a higher initial power surge when starting up.

**Portability and Size:** While high capacity ⁢and power output are desirable,portability is crucial for a power bank you intend to carry around. Consider the size and weight of the power bank, especially if you plan to use it during⁤ travel or ‌outdoor ‌activities.
Opt for a power bank that‍ strikes a balance between capacity and portability. Some models are designed to be​ compact and lightweight, ‌making them easy ​to slip⁢ into a backpack or briefcase. However, keep in mind that larger battery capacities generally translate to larger and heavier power⁣ banks.

**Charging Ports‌ and speed:** In addition to ⁣the AC outlet, most power banks ⁣offer USB-A and⁤ USB-C ports for charging smaller devices like smartphones and tablets. the charging speed of these ports can vary, so look for⁣ power banks that ‍support fast charging technologies⁤ like Power Delivery (PD) and Swift Charge (QC).
These technologies can significantly reduce the charging time for compatible devices. The number and type of USB ports are also important considerations. Ensure the power⁣ bank has enough ports to charge ⁤all your devices together. Some power banks ‌also offer wireless charging capabilities, adding another layer of convenience.

**Safety Features:** safety is paramount when dealing with ​lithium-ion batteries.Look for power banks that incorporate various safety features,‍ such as overcharge protection, over-discharge protection, short circuit protection, ‌and temperature control.These features help prevent ⁢damage to both the power bank and your devices, ensuring safe and reliable operation. reputable brands typically include these ​safety features,which are often certified‍ by ⁤third-party ‌testing organizations. A power bank that ⁤lacks proper‌ safety features could pose a fire hazard or damage your electronic equipment.**Display and Indicators:** A clear display and⁣ indicators can ⁢greatly enhance the user experience. Look for power banks that feature an LCD screen or LED indicators that show the remaining battery capacity, input/output power, and charging status.
This details allows you to monitor the⁣ power bank's performance ​and plan your charging accordingly. Some power banks also provide alerts for error⁢ conditions, such as overheating or overcurrent. A well-designed display makes it easier to manage your power and ⁤avoid unexpected depletion.

1jwevu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1jwevu8/unfriendly_pastors/,Unfriendly Pastors,"What are your thoughts on Christian Leaders being unfriendly in public settings?   Occasionally I’ve noticed those in Ministry at coffee shops, the mall, and at their children’s soccers games seemingly closed off, off in a corner, hardly engaging with anyone, on their phones, and seemingly disinterested with anyone there.  This has severely impacted my faith.  I too have my stressors in life(as we all do)but if I run into someone I will always behave friendly towards them even on my bad days.  I strive to be present and leave someone better off than when I leave them.  Just a simple, “Hi! How are you? What have you guys been up to? Well it was great seeing you!” I’d think would be sufficient.  I’m referring to times when there is not an immediate time crunch.

I find it confusing when I hear a charismatic pastor asking us to be the hands and feet of Jesus, evangelize, love your neighbor, get to know people, love like Jesus, and then when I see a local pastor in town watching his child’s soccer game 50 feet away from everyone else, not engaging with anyone…not the other parents ect… it’s seems off putting.  There’s more examples but I’ll leave it there.  I don’t expect anyone to be 100 percent perfect 24/7 but I’ve seemed to notice a pattern more often than not.  Saying one thing on stage but then observing them day to day being very closed off and unfriendly is very troublesome to my faith walk and understanding of the scriptures.",1,1744336826.0,Christianity,6,1.0,False

A lot of paperwork.

Ethan Wells, Earth’s designated liaison, found himself in **Intergalactic Licensing Office 42B**, surrounded by creatures that looked like sentient ferns, floating jellyfish, and something suspiciously similar to a disgruntled stapler.

""Please take a number,"" a glowing orb buzzed. A small slip popped out: **#9,872,303**.

""How long is the wait?"" Ethan asked.

The orb blinked. “About three lunar cycles. Or two if you have the correct forms in triplicate.”

“I brought everything!” Ethan declared, triumphantly holding up a stack of documents as tall as a giraffe in heels.

The orb scanned the papers. “You’re missing Form ZQ-9001-A: Declaration of Non-Violent Intentions from All Sapient Rodents on Your Planet.”

“...Rats?” Ethan blinked.

“Yes,” the orb said. “We had… an incident on Planet Bloop. Long story.”

Three hours, two coffees, and one negotiation with a raccoon later, Ethan returned with the required form (signed by the Rat Ambassador of New York City). He was ushered into the main licensing chamber, where a crab-like official greeted him without looking up from its twelve monitors.

“Species?”

“Human.”

“Known for?”

“War, memes, and pizza.”

“Standard. Now—” the crab sighed—“you’ll need to pass the Galactic Driver’s Test to get official planetary mobility clearance.”

“I’m… sorry, what?”

The crab slid over a steering wheel and a tiny asteroid.

“You need to parallel park this between those two space whales.”

Ethan stared. “That’s not possible.”

The crab raised an eyestalk. “Neither is skipping the test.”

Three failed attempts, one whale politely flipping him off, and a small existential crisis later, Ethan passed—barely.

The crab stamped his form. “Congratulations. Earth is now officially part of the Galactic Federation. You'll receive your Welcome Basket within 6–8 warp cycles.”

“What's in the basket?”

“Coupons. Mostly for laser hair removal and asteroid insurance.”

Ethan exhaled. “Well, at least we’re in.”

“Of course,” the crab nodded. “But if you want *voting rights*, you’ll need to fill out Form 88X-Pluto-9 and schedule a psychometric empathy scan.”

now, she says she won’t let any of us know where she works.. but because she just cannot keep her mouth shut and HAS to brag about being able to attend music festivals “for free”, she dropped little nuggets of information here and there, forgetting that nashville isn’t a big place in the grand scheme of things?? did she forget that a lot of the people who despise her are people who live within the same vicinity as her?? not only that, but dana’s got a pretty recognisable face/build.. unfortunate, but recognisable regardless. 

to add in the cherry on the cake, she’s wearing a shirt that says ‘wiener’ on it - poor dana, who cries at every opportunity because she ‘doesn’t have a dick’ having to cut about in a shirt that most likely has her trigger word on it all day. 

finally: to post on your story that your whole body aches after a full day of work?? welcome to the real world. this is what hard grind actually is, too bad you won’t be able to record yourself slinging hot dogs at the stand to be able to make “money” whilst doing work. what a shame.

Loud hipster setting. 

STALKER (V.O.)
You met me at a low point in my life, Rabbit. I was drowning, adrift, until that first awkward glance. Our eyes locked for a heartbeat in that café on Elm Street, and I swear I’d known you forever. It wasn’t enough, though. 

INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

STALKER (V.O.)
Seeing you wasn’t something that happened often—not every day, not yet. So I made it happen. We didn’t have any classes together, so I changed my routine, woke up earlier, carved out time for the little things—like watching you walk through the world, oblivious to me. I had to get closer. The more I saw you, the sooner I’d find the courage to speak to you. That’s what I told myself.

EXT./INT. COLLEGE GYM/COFFEE BAR - MORNING

STALKER (V.O.)
I’ve always been good at watching. It’s a quiet art—patience, a steady eye, a heart that doesn’t flinch. You didn’t know I was there at first, with your chestnut hair spilling over your shoulders like a river I could drown in. Every morning at 7:12, you’d arrive to campus, sneakers scuffing the pavement as you jogged to the gym. By 7:45, you’d be at that café, lips brushing the coffee cup in a way that made my chest ache. I learned your rhythm, your pulse. It was ours, even if you didn’t feel it yet.

INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

STALKER (V.O.)
I’d sit across from you—hidden behind a newspaper, a phone screen—mapping your life. Mondays, you worked late at the library, fingers brushing dusty books I’d never read. Fridays, you laughed with… him—too close—at that dive bar, the neon sign flickering over your gin and tonic. Then fate handed me your name. You dropped your debit card one day, and I picked it up-

STALKER
(to himself)
—Emily…

STALKER (V.O.)
A sign we were meant to be. 

EXT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT/DAY

STALKER (V.O.)
I found you online—Facebook, Instagram—every post a window into your soul. I learned your address. I hid in your bushes, close enough to hear you hum off-key in the shower, to see you chew your lip when you read. I wasn’t a stranger—I knew you.
I left gifts. A rose on your doorstep, your lost debit card wedged in your door, a note under your windshield wiper—“You’re beautiful when you run.” You’d frown, glance around, but you never saw me. I was a shadow, a breath on the wind. I thought you’d feel the pull I did, that you’d understand. The longer I watched you, the more I wanted to be you—be inside you—feel you all over me—use you to fill the hollow ache I’d carried for too long. I wanted you to imagine us together—happy, married, two kids, maybe three, a dog, a suburban house with a perfect lawn. Exactly as I’d imagined it. Picture-perfect. You’d see it too, I was sure.

INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

STALKER (V.O.)
Last night, I couldn’t wait anymore. Seeing you let another guy into your apartment, and the sheer thought of anyone but me having your heart, lit a fire within me that burned hotter than Hell itself. My heart hammered as I knocked on your door. You opened it, eyes wide, that perfect mouth parting in surprise. 

EMILY
Hello? Who are—?

STALKER 
Emily…

STALKER (V.O.)
—I said, my voice steady despite the storm inside me.

STALKER
I’ve been watching you. I love you.

STALKER (V.O.)
I told you about our future—the house, the dog, the mornings we’d share. I thought you’d see it. But you didn’t. You stepped back, your face twisting into something ugly—fear, disgust. 

EMILY
Get out! I knew someone was watching me! 

STALKER (V.O.)
—you said, sharp and cold.

EMILY
I don’t even know you!

STALKER (V.O.)
You tried to shut the door, but I was faster. I pushed inside, hands trembling. 

STALKER
You don’t mean that. You just don’t see it yet.

INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

STALKER (V.O.)
You screamed, clawed at me, and then I saw him—your guy friend. 

The GUY FRIEND storms out from the living room, alerted. 

GUY FRIEND
Is this him?

EMILY
Yes!

The guy friend tries to tackle him but is quickly overpowered. 

STALKER (V.O.)
He was easy—a quick crack to the skull with the lamp, and he was gone. The hard part was making you shut up and listen. 
He binds her arms and legs, and tapes her mouth shut. 

CUT TO

He‘s got her in the bathtub, talking down to her as she lays there, trembling. 

STALKER
But if this is the type of ungrateful behavior I’m to expect from you, then I don’t think this is going to work out. But… I’m sure you’ll come around. I’m not letting you go that easily.
(smiling)
Okay, now you can talk.

He rips the duct tape from her mouth. 

EMILY
(trembling)
Please, let me go. I won’t tell anyone.

STALKER
(laughing)
Don’t be silly, Rabbit. You and I both know that won’t happen.
Trust me, I wish I could just take you in the living room, watch some white noise together but it can’t happen. If I let you live too long, you’ll think of other men you’d leave me for and… well, women aren’t exactly known for being the best at resisting temptation, even if all they’ll ever need is right in their faces.

EMILY
Please, don’t kill me.

STALKER (V.O.)
But you didn’t understand. You never would. 
I grabbed your throat, squeezed until your eyes softened and went still. The knife was sharp—I’d bought it for you, in a way. The first cut was hard, but then it flowed. Blood bloomed like roses, warm and thick, pooling around you. I worked carefully, separating you into pieces I could hold, pieces I could keep. You were mine now, truly mine.
I stripped down, stepped into the tub with you. The blood was slick, warm against my skin. I ran my hands over my arms, my chest, painting myself in you. It was beautiful—our union, our forever. I closed my eyes and saw you smiling, the way you were supposed to. No more rejection, no more distance. Just us, bound in red.
I’ll clean up later. For now, I sit here, breathing you in, gargling you in my mouth. My Rabbit, my Emily. You’re quiet now, the way I always dreamed you’d be.

He quietly caresses Emily’s severed head which lays on his chest, casually landing peck kisses on her forehead. Her eyes lifelessly stare at nothing…

There is a bunch of things I just don't want to say to your face, especially in relation to the whole quitting smoking thing which you call ""a pause"" cause you don't believe smokers can ever quit completely. As you've said, you've seen the same things oh so many times and I just don't want to give you an unnecessary mindf... with how busy you've been lately.

It seemed to me at some point for a moment that you're distancing yourself from me. And then I see the smile on your stunningly beautiful face, the sparks in your kind eyes, feel your gentle and ridiculously good kiss on my lips and hear you say the kindest things I've ever been told. I even got you to tell me that you love me outside of the bedroom. In all honesty you don't even have to tell me that at all ever. Just please don't let me think you're going somewhere. I was so worried my birthday might go to all crap because I believed you want to distance yourself, and then... And then you do all those things, show so much care and say things like ""you saying that you feel happy this morning was so good to hear"" and I want to cry tears of joy. Yes ljubavi moja. And that's all because of you. And I know I am overreliant on you when it comes to me feeling happy. As I told you before, you're the only part of my life that doesn't suck in one way or another. I need to find other sources of happiness and fulfillment but I don't know where, yet. I will do my best though.

I have just turned 25. I am fairly convinced by this point that I was not genuinely loved by anyone before you. You accepted me the way I am, with all of my issues and quirks, you also read me like an open book and that scares the f... out of me, but you do not use that against me. One thing you accepted me with is my 10 years of heavy smoking. You come from a smoking folk and a smoking family while having asthma you don't even treat (please put that goddamn inhaler in your backpack already). You even got me an ashtray for when I hang out at your balcony. You never told me my smoking was an issue.

Then you noticed my smoker's cough. Then I got sick and you noticed a really weird wheeze while you were resting on my chest. You looked very concerned. Then I got a little tipsy and told you I'm going to quit around my birthday. You brought that up as a dare soon after. I am a woman of my word, so I accepted the dare.

I had my last cigarette over three days ago. I am very unsure if I will be able to commit to the whole quitting endeavour or if you'll turn out to be right about the pause thing.

But. You have an incredible ability to scratch my soul bleeding. When I announced that I quit, the comments you made... The whole narrative of yours in that regard became one of...pain. You are frustrated that you've been exposed to smoke since you were a child and that you have a lot of anger for smokers. You literally said you hate smoking (even though most people you love are, in fact, smokers). You expressed enjoyment when I offered to go inside as opposed to outside for us to have our coffee on a windy day since I don't have a cigarette with my coffee anymore. You noted how unusual it is to hang out with me not smoking a single tab. All of it... Well, I actually told you that part -- ""I want to provide you with a comfortable and safe space you have nothing to hate about. And it's beneficial for me as well"".

What I didn't tell you is that it literally pierces me through hearing how much pain you have in relation to people around you smoking. I am so, so sorry. And something else that makes me look like a loser right now is -- that is my main motivation to not pick up a cigarette so far. Look, I like smoking. It helps me think, it helps me function, I just like the process as well. I know it harms me but I could not care less and you know very well why. The initial dare from you and your subsequent reactions are the reason why I am not smoking. It is bloody tedious to fight the cravings and to gasp gasp gasp for air as I talk to my trainees or whatever at work. I know it is extremely unhealthy to pin my motivation on whomever else but myself but I can't help it. Basically I am trying to quit 85% because of your pain. The strongest thought that stops me from the craving is one of you, the one that reminds me just how much I love you. I just keep telling myself, ""I love her. I love her like nobody else ever. I want her to feel better around me"". The worst part is, there was never a different person in the world about whom a similar thought would've worked. I don't care about people enough. I just happen to care about you a stupid lot for no reason.

I know I am completely and utterly screwed. If it crashes and burns, and it probably eventually will because of us being a major mesalliance in the eyes of the local society (and us being two chicks, on top of that. chicks... you're not a chick, you're the najbolja žena u svijetu) -- I will of course survive but this is going to be bad. I need to find ways to not pin so much on you without you even being aware.

There is something I need to confess, but will never tell to your face.

You are my literal reason to wake up and not think how much I hate myself and my life and how much I just want to die. (Thank God you don't stalk my Reddit.) You make my life worth living.

And yes. You are the love of my life. With the ridiculously low odds of us even meeting, then you somehow liking me at all... You are a gift I never deserved.

I will see you soon.

Canadian IMP Menu 15, 2020 Vintage!

This was great!!!! No, I did not use the Tobasco.

1st of all you have to set your expectations properly. Crispy fries? Nope. Cheese curds? Absolutely! Chicken? Plenty! Yummy gravy? As you can see, totally!

This thing is loaded with unprocessed chicken. The cheese curds are absolutely present and distinguishable from the other components. They have plenty of spring as well. The potatos are perfect, soft, with great texture. The gravy is savory and chicken flavored obviously. Was it salty? Yes. But not so much you won't enjoy it.

Tortillas went to my doggo Reesey (see pic 7), who seems to really like ration tortillas for some reason. 

PB and Mars bar were eaten by my son...PB on the Mars bar of course (try a KitKat with PB on it, life changing...lol).

Pro tip, put the Nescafe Sweet and Creamy (for those that do not know, Nescafe Sweet and Creamy is freeze-dried coffee that has creamer and sugar already added, commonly referred to as a 3 in 1 coffee, it contains, I believe, about 75 kcal) into the Vanilla Drink Mix, add water, and mix the living shenanigans out of it.  Just shake it well in the bag. When I have these kinds of drinks, even from US rations, I make the day before and mix several times throughout the evening.

The coffee with the vanilla just makes such a great combination! 

The sliced pears were great! All the IMP wet pack fruit is great. It's refreshing to have real fruit and the ability to drink the juice as well. I am sure soldiers love that aspect. 

The peanut mix was fantastic! Sweet and salty, perfectly crunchy. A very hearty snack for sure, and the portion is great at 270 kcal.

The raspberry jam was actually eaten on some Czech Republic crisp bread; it was great too and made in Stone Mountain Georgia....not sure why we make jams for Canadian IMPs, but that jam is worthy of praise regardless of where it comes from. 

Fruit punch was reserved for a later date.

I can confidently assess this ration was, in fact, not poopoo; it was great and I recommend!

Demented fans are buying religious kitsch depicting the accused assassin (WSJ) by Faith Bottum",">Luigi Mangione is a saint, according to his fans: “Saint Luigi, Patron Saint of Healthcare Access for All” their posts read. The 26-year-old accused killer is depicted online with a green mantle, a red Sacred Heart, a gold halo and his hand raised in benediction.

>Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Mr. Mangione’s “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination” of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson in New York in December—even as a supporter writes, “I hope Luigi doesn’t have to die for us to receive free healthcare like Jesus had to die for us to receive forgiveness.”

>You can buy devotional candles bearing Mr. Mangione’s image and a “Prayer of Saint Luigi” on the back. A Saint Luigi “Sherpa Fleece Blanket” for $69.99. A coffee mug for $12. A necklace for $45. A “Patron Saint of Capitalism’s Victims” T-shirt or a “Luigi Mangione Our Patriot Saint Of Healthcare” T-shirt, both for $22.99. St. Luigi Christmas ornaments for $16.99.

>An account on GiveSendGo, a Christian crowd-funding site, has raised more than $836,000 for Mr. Mangione’s legal defense. A donor there writes, “I cried on my knees to God as a mother to keep you safe and mentally calm.” Another describes Mr. Mangione as “a father to millions.” The website offers three options to help Mr. Mangione: give, share, pray.

>Street art depicting the supposed religious hero has spread, with “God Bless Luigi Mangione” stickers appearing on ATMs. A digital mobile billboard in New York depicts him as a saint, with the image projected on a lower Manhattan building. Murals have sprung up in London and Seattle. Stickers depicting Mr. Mangione as a Christ figure can be found in cities from Paris to West Dundee, Ill. In San Francisco, they show him holding a modified Bible.

>Mr. Mangione’s family is Catholic. His grandmother, Mary Mangione, helped Loyola University Maryland in Baltimore acquire an expensive Bible and was memorialized by the school in 2023 as a woman who believed “passionately in the value of Catholic Jesuit education.” His family has contributed millions of dollars to Catholic organizations.

>It’s hard to know what Mr. Mangione thinks of his new fans and their iconography. In an old post on [X.com](http://X.com), he recommended users look at an article lamenting that “Christianity’s decline has unleashed terrible new gods.” The elevation to sainthood of an accused assassin seems a clear example of how terrible those new gods are.

>Mr. Mangione’s fans—the ones wearing the T-shirts and buying pious Luigi keychains—will only get louder, proclaiming him a martyr. More than 40% of Americans age 18-29 think the shooting of the healthcare CEO was acceptable or somewhat acceptable, according to a Dec. 17 Emerson poll. The sanctimonious fervor won’t stop anytime soon.

>It’s blasphemy, of course, the idea of saints as glorified killers. And probably few proclaiming his sanctity are actually religious. What all this kitsch shows is an unserious nation that wants a folk hero. Mr. Mangione shouldn’t be it.",46,1744335408.0,FreeLuigi,26,0.88,False

The idea is to generate all possible pages, combining both <services> with <locations> to create location based SEO services.

For service + location pages try your best to create a modular (you can use svg icons to make this work) set up, with at least 5-7 different vertical unique blocks that add to the overall value of the page - this is important, because these are the pages we are truly trying to rank, and if they don’t have enough good unique information on them, they won’t rank. Ensure they are as varied as possible by using templates

Ensure the pages are split by service, so no two service landing page should look the same (even if the service + location page do look the same)

Make sure the colors are contrasting and not white on white or black on black at any point

The content of those pages should be landing pages for the service itself, created from a template that you have built, using the images, and the other information you know or can interpret from what you’ve been given.

Have a good looking contact us page with the <contact\_details> on it

# Cuisinart Grind & Brew 2025: Best Models Compared & Reviewed (Is It Worth It?)

For the discerning coffee lover, nothing beats the aroma and taste of freshly ground beans brewed to perfection. The Cuisinart coffee grind and brew line promises exactly that: a seamless, automated experience from whole bean to flavorful cup. But with various models on the market, how do you choose the right one? This comprehensive guide will delve into the world of Cuisinart grind and brew automatic coffee makers, comparing popular models, exploring their features, and ultimately answering the question: is a Cuisinart grind and brew really worth the investment?

[[Explore Top rated cuisinart coffee grind and brew on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=cuisinart coffee grind and brew)
## The Allure of Freshly Ground Coffee

Before we dive into specific models, let's address the fundamental appeal of a coffee maker with built in grinder. Pre-ground coffee loses its flavor and aroma relatively quickly. The moment coffee beans are ground, they begin to oxidize, diminishing the vibrant taste that coffee enthusiasts crave.A Cuisinart coffee maker with grinder allows you to enjoy the freshest possible coffee, grinding the beans just moments before brewing.This considerably enhances the flavor profile, resulting in a richer, smoother, and more aromatic cup.

For the busy homeowner or renter seeking convenience, combining the grinding and brewing process into one appliance is a game-changer. Instead of needing a separate grinder and coffee maker, a Cuisinart grind and brew offers an all-in-one solution, saving counter space and simplifying the morning routine.

## Understanding the Cuisinart Grind & brew Lineup

Cuisinart offers a range of grind and brew models, each with its own set of features and functionalities. Navigating this landscape can be overwhelming, so let's break down some of the most popular options and highlight their key differences:

*   **Cuisinart DGB-900BC:** Frequently enough considered a flagship model, the DGB-900BC is renowned for its reliability and performance. This Cuisinart supreme grind and brew features a burr grinder, known for its consistent grind size and ability to preserve the coffee's flavor. it boasts a large 12-cup capacity, programmable features, and a bold setting for those who prefer a stronger brew. Many consider it one of the best Cuisinart grind and brew options available.

*   **Cuisinart DGB-800:** As referenced in official sources, the DGB-800 is a close relative of the DGB-900BC. It also utilizes a burr grinder and offers a 12-cup capacity. Key distinctions may include subtle design differences or slightly varied programming options. A comparison of the Cuisinart DGB 800 vs 900 often comes down to personal preference and minor feature variations.

*   **Cuisinart DGB-650BC:** This model offers a balance of features and affordability.While it might not have all the bells and whistles of the higher-end models, the cuisinart DGB 650BC still delivers fresh-ground coffee convenience at a more accessible price point. It typically features a blade grinder,which,while not as consistent as a burr grinder,still offers a significant upgrade over pre-ground coffee.

*   **Cuisinart Coffee Center grind and Brew Plus (SS-GB1):** This model integrates a 12-cup automatic drip coffee maker with grinder functionalities with a single-serve brewing option, providing ultimate versatility. Referenced on Amazon, the Coffee Center allows users to brew a full carafe or a single cup using either fresh coffee beans or coffee pods. It has a built-in coffee grinder for whole beans, and charcoal water filter.

*   **Cuisinart DGB-2 Single-Serve Grind & Brew coffee Maker:** The DGB-2 referenced on Cuisinart's official site focuses on single-serve brewing, offering a compact solution for individuals who prefer smaller batches. It features a built-in conical burr grinder, enabling fresh bean grinding for each cup.This design is ideal for those with limited counter space or those who primarily brew single cups of coffee.

When making your choice, consider your brewing needs, budget, and desired features. Do you prioritize a burr grinder for optimal flavor? Do you need a large capacity for entertaining? Or are you looking for a compact, single-serve solution? Answering these questions will help you narrow down your options.

## Burr Grinder vs. Blade Grinder: Understanding the Difference

One of the most crucial distinctions between Cuisinart grind and brew models is the type of grinder they employ: burr or blade.

*   **Burr Grinders:** These grinders use two revolving abrasive surfaces (burrs) to crush coffee beans into uniformly sized particles. This consistent grind size is crucial for optimal extraction and flavor. Burr grinders produce less heat than blade grinders,which helps to preserve the coffee's delicate aromas and oils. Models like the DGB-900BC and DGB-800 feature burr grinders. Conical burr grinder coffee maker offers a premium grinding experience.

*   **Blade Grinders:** Blade grinders use a spinning blade to chop the coffee beans. While faster and more affordable, blade grinders tend to produce an uneven grind, with some particles being too coarse and others too fine. This inconsistency can lead to bitter or sour tasting coffee. The Cuisinart DGB-650BC typically uses a blade grinder. Consumers prioritize burr grinders for a superior and controlled grind.

If you're a serious coffee aficionado who values flavor above all else, a cuisinart grind and brew with a burr grinder is the way to go. However, if you're on a budget or prioritize convenience over absolute perfection, a blade grinder model can still provide a significant improvement over pre-ground coffee.[[Explore Top Rated cuisinart coffee grind and brew on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=cuisinart coffee grind and brew)
## Key Features to Consider

Beyond the type of grinder, several other features can influence your satisfaction with a Cuisinart grind and brew:

*   **Programmability:** Most models offer programmable features, allowing you to set a brew time in advance. This is perfect for waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Look for models with adjustable auto-off settings and brew strength control.

*   **Capacity:** consider how much coffee you typically brew. Cuisinart grind and brew models typically offer a 12-cup capacity, but single-serve options are also available.

*   **Filter Type:** cuisinart coffee makers often come with a gold tone filter, which is reusable and helps to preserve the coffee's natural oils. Paper filters can also be used for a cleaner, less sediment-filled brew. Also consider the Cuisinart water filter, which helps remove chlorine and other impurities from your water for better-tasting coffee.

*   **Carafe Type:** Glass carafes are common, but some models may offer thermal carafes that keep coffee hot for longer without burning.

*   **Cleaning and Maintenance:** Look for models with removable parts that are easy to clean. The Cuisinart dgb cleaning process shoudl be straightforward. Some models also have an auto-rinse feature that helps to keep the grinder clean.

*   **Warranty and Customer Service:** A good warranty and responsive Cuisinart customer service can provide peace of mind in case of any issues. Always review the warranty terms before making a purchase.

## Addressing Common Issues and Troubleshooting

While Cuisinart grind and brew models are generally reliable, occasional issues may arise. Here are some common problems and potential solutions:

*   **Coffee Maker Not Grinding:** Check to ensure the bean hopper is properly seated and contains coffee beans. Also, make sure there are no obstructions in the grinder.

*   **Coffee Maker Not Brewing:** ensure the water reservoir is filled and the filter basket is properly inserted. Also, check the power cord and outlet.

*   **Coffee Tastes Bitter:** This could be due to over-extraction, which can be caused by using too fine of a grind or brewing for too long. Adjust the grind size or brewing time accordingly.*   **Coffee Tastes Weak:** This could be due to under-extraction, which can be caused by using too coarse of a grind or not using enough coffee. Adjust the grind size or coffee-to-water ratio.

If you're unable to resolve an issue yourself, consult the Cuisinart coffee maker grind and brew manual or contact Cuisinart customer service for assistance.

My 6yo daughter, Maya (not her real name), asked for a strawberry donut, and I nodded. A woman, likely in her 30's, whom we'll call Karen (not her real name), cut in front of me and my daughter as the line started to move. I explained to her that she cut us, as politely as possible, and she lost it. She went on to shout that ""strawberry donuts are gross"", and Maya began to cry. I explained, in a whisper so Maya wouldn't hear, that strawberry was her mom's favorite flavor. Unfortunately, Maya's Mom, the love of my life, passed away a year ago from breast cancer. Karen then seemed to show some sympathy. She crouched down to meet Maya eye-to-eye, and asked,"" strawberry was your moms favorite?"" Maya nodded. After a moment of silence, Karen said,"" she was an idiot. You should be happy she's dead."" Maya started screaming and wailing. My papa bear instincts kicked in and I gripped Karen's shoulder and pulled her away from Maya. I then yelled,""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?"" She then asked,"" what's wrong with you? You must've been a terrible husband for your wife to let the cancer win."" I have a bad history of anger issues, and she had just crossed the line. However, I couldn't let Maya see me like that. I just closed my eyes, took a deep breathe, and left with Maya. I watched Karen pull into the parking lot, so I knew which car was hers. As we walked past her car, I stuck my Air tag to her car. As Maya and I drove away, I called my sister and asked her to watched Maya, claiming there was an emergency at the office. After that, I tracked the air tag and found out where Karen lived. Before I met my wife, I worked for a 3-lettered government department that could make it seem like you never existed. I pulled out my laptop, and, via a backdoor into her wifi, I was able to connect to the entirety of her house. TVs, game consoles, computers, but most of all, her security system. Cameras, mics and speakers were mine to control. I drove home with my newly acquired reality television show, and started writing a program. The one I developed made it to where each speaker played a quick, random sound every few minutes. After a couple of hours. Kare started tearing her house apart to find the crickets, kittens, dropped pens, and, my personal favorite, smoke detectors in need of new batteries. After that, I decided to go a little further. I connected an AI narrator to the speakers and told her, ""The cops are on the way. A warrant for your arrest has been issued. Controlled substances, unregistered weapons, murder. All charges the you are being accused of."" This notification played over and over again, accompanied by a blaring siren. After Karen screamed, packed some clothes and jewelry, she left. I haven't seen her on the cameras for the past 3 hours. I know it's a bit too far, and I do kinda feel bad. However, I'll be damned if I let someone disrespect my late wife and our daughter.

I use different versions of Windows and kinects and power supplies from different manufacturers.  None of that matters.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I install a Kinect, I can expect anywhere from an hour to several days to get it working. 

None of the steps you hear about online will work. If they do, its just by coincidence I believe, and the person reporting the fix didn't realize that it was something else that got things to work.  So forget about microphone permissions and power management settings its a waste of time.

Similar you'll have people suggest you have a bad power supply, but when this happens I can swap with known working power supplies and Kinects and the problem remains, proving its windows settings and/or driver related.

In one of my computers I might be running the new Kinect driver, on another it's 1409, again there is no real rhyme or reason to that.   So what does work? I'll tell you now but you aren't going to like it.

The truth is that there are NO reliable instructions to get them working.  You're going into battle, so put on a pot of coffee and get ready for a long day.  The only person who really knows why they are power cycling when you install them are the retired Kinect developers, and those F'ers are too lazy to take a moment of their time to log into one of these forums and put us out of our misery with some helpful advice.  

What you have to do is completely uninstall any trace of Kinect on your system: Unplug your kinect.  Stop running kinect tasks, stop running Kinect services, remove Kinect programs from add/remove programs, and in device manager enable show hidden devices and find all references to XBOX or Kinect and uninstall).  Then reboot.  Then install your new driver, take your pick but start with the latest, and then plug the Kinect in to the fastest USB port you have.  After that it might work, you can verify in Kinect v2 Configuration verifier tool (even if you don't install the SDK, just keep the configurationVerifier tool folder somewhere and you can use it with any version of the drivers.  Then watch the 'kinect connected' either stay green, or cycle every 8 seconds between connected and  not (red X).  If that happens, you have to DO THE ALL AGAIN FROM SCRATCH.  Every time you try, change either the version of the Kinect driver or the USB port.  Eventually after the 9th attempt you might get lucky and it works.

When you finally get it working, and you've got to really believe it will because it always does when it wants to, create a SYSTEM RESTORE POINT named OMG KINECT WORKS so that when Windows does an update in the future and breaks everything, you'll want to roll back.

And speaking of Windows updates, I actually turn off the wifi in my business on computers where I use Kinects, and unplug the LAN cable and warn staff not to plug them in under any circumstances. Because when you connect to the internet Windows gets super excited and immediately installs the latest updates and Kinect often breaks again.

Another thing I should point out is that if your audio is toggling on and off along with the kinect (doesn't always happen), and you see a little X next to your speaker/audio symbol on your desktop, thats fairly good news. Because in those cases you just have to download the latest RealTek audio drivers for your computer and Kinect will start working again. But only when the audio cycles with the Kinect.  And always remember to make a restore point when its working.

My anxiety is probably 2x worse than before and the intrusive thoughts are killing me. And with the low mood, I don't think I can stand this anymore. Sorry folks, this forum helped me a lot but I don't think I can continue. I plan to ramp back my caffeine intake starting tomorrow. Sorry....",4,1744333869.0,decaf,9,0.83,False

This job has been so fulfilling. It means a lot to me. I don't have a family or support system, and federal service has been my rock.

This is a warning...protect your peace. Hold the line. These are not mutually exclusive. Unionize. Call your coworkers and onboarding buddies. Keep your head down and focus. They want to break you.

I am doing much better now, with the help of my partner, support system, and good exercise. We're going to get through this. We all need to focus on inner balance and peace...not just ""holding the line"".  I decided to come out and share this because I KNOW other people have been going through very similar experiences.

## Understanding Your Espresso Machine Needs: A Tailored Approach

Before diving into specific models, let's address the diverse needs of our target audience. The ""best"" espresso machine is subjective and depends entirely on the context.

**For the Home Barista:** Forget ""commercial"" for a moment. While you might crave that barista-quality experience at home, features like programmable settings and precise temperature control are key. The best espresso machine for you provides the ability to fine-tune brewing parameters and consistently deliver exceptional espresso quality. You likely appreciate semi-automatic espresso machines where you control the extraction or even a manual espresso machine if you love the hands-on approach. Brands like breville,profitec,and ECM offer excellent options known for thier quality portafilters and temperature stability. Consider models with a powerful steam wand for creating latte art. focus on durability and readily available maintainance resources.

**For Coffee Shop Owners:** Efficiency, speed, and reliability are paramount. A cafe needs a commercial grade espresso machine capable of handling high volumes without compromising quality. Seek multi group machines, ideally double group or even multi group ones, that allow your baristas to work efficiently during peak hours.Consider automatic or super-automatic espresso machines to consistent shot volumes. Brands like Nuova Simonelli and La Marzocco are renowned for their robust build and reliable performance. Don't overlook warranty and service options, as downtime can be costly. Look at espresso machine financing options to manage the initial investment.

**For Restaurant Owners:** Versatility and space efficiency are critical. You need an espresso machine that can handle more than just espresso; consider cappuccino machine and latte machine capabilities. Look for models that are easy to use and clean, fitting seamlessly into your existing workflow. A compact,but powerful,machine is ideal. Consider reputable brands known for their reliability, such as Rancilio, that offer smaller, but still capable, commercial espresso machine options. Ensure training and support are available to your staff. The machine's aesthetics should also align with your restaurant's decor.

**For Office Managers:** Ease of use, minimal maintenance, and affordability are top priorities. Employees want convenience and variety. Super-automatic espresso machines are generally the best choice, offering push-button operation and a range of drink options. Look for models with large water tanks and hoppers to minimize refills. De'Longhi is a popular brand for office environments, offering cost-effective solutions that deliver decent coffee quality. Value reliability and durability to minimize downtime.

**For Hotel Purchasers:** Consistency,ease of use for diverse staff,and reliability are essential. Consider different sizes and configurations depending on the location within the hotel – a high-volume machine in the lobby, a compact machine for suites. Programmable options ensure repeatably good results. The aesthetics of the espresso machine are also vrey meaningful.Look for long warranties and good service contracts.

What’s the big deal about going on a date that we both like? As someone who doesn’t drink alcohol I would much rather get to know you over a cold brew rather than whiskey. The fact that it’s more socially acceptable to go to bars rather than a coffee shop is completely mind blowing. And if you ask someone (we all know the type) WHY they don’t like coffee dates then I guarantee you that the answer would be insane. It’s frustrating to date in this day and age because no moral setting is acceptable and nothing is good enough. There are so many bizarre rules that people focus more on “what can they do for me,” or “what are the signs that they like me,” that they neglect simply being present with a person or taking time to foster a genuine connection with them. It’s not just coffee. Restaurants are also an issue. You have to go all out to impress the person on the first date so you have to find something that isn’t cheese cake factory but also isn’t McDonalds. The whole dating structure is insane. The downside to all of this is that even though you’re likely to pay because you’re expected to, tip and gas included, there is a high chance that THEY’RE NOT EVEN INTO YOU!

1jwdvr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jwdvr7/my_ex_of_25_years_f20_has_reached_out_to_me_again/,"My ex of 2.5 years (F20), has reached out to me again (M21), 3 years later after breakup. I am not desperate for her but would love to start over with her again. She seems to be testing me again. How do i move forward?","Before I explain everything, I hope you can get into my mind and understand my perspective.

I am also looking for advice or if anyone could read what is going on and explain to me a little bit what they can observe. For the most part, I can look at the situation objectively now, with all emotions aside, but I’d love any other input and advice on how to move forward.

Context: Meeting to first dating: back in early 2020, Right before quarantine, I was a sophomore in high school. I met this girl who would end up changing my life. I was 16 (M) and she was 15 (F) at the time. We were in the same grade because I had been held back. I first dmed this girl on instagram in late December and met up with her for the first time on New Year’s Eve. She was interested in me from the start and I became her first kiss that night. She was the most innocent girl and I was surprised to find out she had never even kissed anyone before. Objectively looking back on it now, I think she lacked attention and also was a very dedicated Christian, but still wanted to have a boyfriend or “find someone”. The next two months we went on dates, and I played a card of some high value dude that also had the ability to Pull other girls, i'd leave her on delivered all day because I would be at my sport’s practice. Next thing you know, she asks me when I am gonna ask her out because I was getting in her head. In this stage, I was kinda playing games and got her attached and made her want to lock me down. So I ask her out in February 2020 and we start dating.

Quarantine days, how the relationship dynamic was:

Covid 19 goes into full effect and all I would end up seeing was her every single day. I loved being with her and she was so in love with me but I let her do all the chasing. I’d be with her 7 days a week and didn’t go a day without talking to her. But she would always be the one to ask me to hangout for the most part and I would show up as myself. She would always post me and gave the most wonderful meaningful gifts throughout our relationship such as a scrapbook of all of our memories with a caption in her writing describing the photo. Letters, picture frames, she would gift me all these things that have sentimental value that would later kill me inside after the real breakup. Now going back to quarantine in 2020, we have sex for the first time between 3-4 months into the relationship. She started crying that night and regretted it after because we were both saving ourselves for marriage and ended up doing it. She said she wanted God to be the center of our relationship and said that we compromised that and we shouldn’t have done it. She breaks up with me. in the next 5 days, she had been house sitting and told me that she was crying every second of the day because she loves me so much and doesn’t want to lose me. I tell her that I miss her too and that we can change that moving forward. We end up getting back together and date again. Didn’t have sex for about a month and than it was pretty much every day we would for the remainder of the relationship. She felt safe with me and thought we would get married. She would always want to read the Bible and go to church and I would sometimes get annoyed because it was too much. As a Christian personally, I believe that my own personal relationship with God is the most important. For her, she always wanted to read the Bible every single night and go to church every possible day it was offered. Having different philosophies about how we go about our religion was something that made me really annoyed and I ended up becoming a prick about it. You’d be able to hear it in my tone that I was getting annoyed. This annoyed tone started to translate to just being with her in general and I started to take her for granted. During the rest of the relationship, we broke up 3 or 4 more times over stupid things (arguing or some other minor things) because I was immature and didn’t know how to act in a relationship as a man. We would get back together each time within a week. In april of 2022 was the last time that happened. She had came over and it was such a small argument but I think she just got sick of having these small arguments and she asked me if I even wanted to be with her anymore. I decided to be a tough guy and tell her “no, not really”. And she left my house that day and we went no contact for about few days.

Post breakup: During the relationship I had gotten very pudgy. I am 5’11, 155 lb normally (before the relationship). During the relationship, I got comfortable and gained weight, then being 195lb at my heaviest. I don’t remember why but towards the end of the relationship I did start to get back into shape a little bit. Anyways, about a week goes by and I realize that this game of getting back together after a week didn’t happen this time. I started to get nervous and than I started to freak out on my own time because she was serious this time. She ended up texting me but this time she said she misses me, and than I said “I miss you too” and than she would say “we can’t get back together right now.” This repeats over a whole year and a half for what felt like over 100 times. Sometimes it would take longer for her to reach out but she never let me go into no contact. She loved me and still cared about me but did not want to get back together. She just wanted to know I was still there. I knew what was happening and I knew that I should go no contact, but when i did, she would break it with no intent of getting back together. Then I would go no contact again, then again she would continually reach out to check on me, and i would always respond. She than got what she wanted, which was to be validated by the fact that I am still there, that i didn't find a girlfriend yet or something. She would give me false sense of hope and absolutely destroy my mind unintentionally. I would be fine one day and she would be so sweet and genuine like she always has been. Then a few times, I had enough of her doing that and broke character, I would turn it into talking about “I can change”, old memories, crying, begging. Then again, she would say “we shouldn’t be doing this”. I basically scared her because it wasn’t what she wanted anymore. She also never wanted to let go but it was easier for her because she was the one in power now. I had gotten a taste of my own medicine. During this time, she would be in my head 24/7 nonstop. I would think of every possible way to fix it and all it did was hurt me because when I made up a solution in my head, it didn’t go as planned and it killed me. For the most part, I would cry every single day, I’d get so mad but channeled my anger and sadness into becoming the best version of myself. I worked out 7 days a week and got shredded as possible. I took the cut too far and went down to 140 and was shredded. I also had been at community college for a year grinding to get into my dream school which was USC. So after a year and a half, right before I went to USC in the fall, I saw her again and I was driving my nice car, shredded, and at my dream school. I really did create value. But by the time I happened, her attraction to me was so low because I begged and pleaded and didn’t represent a man anymore (this happened about a year and a half later after the breakup,  Summer 2023). I will say, I always had worked out and stuff and always planned to go to usc. But about 75% of the motivation was thanks to her. In the end I thought I became a better person whether or not the reason of motivation didn’t come from within and was based on someone else. I felt like a whole new person after that, I looked at life so differently. And what makes me feel somewhat sad is that she never dated, never drank, or did anything during that time. she kept all her values of being a sweet Christian girl, repurifying for marriage, going to work and even became a more hardcore Christian during that time. She went on a mission trip to Africa and just had such good intentions. She gives everything to God which is how it should be for me. All While I was sitting there crying, getting with a lot of girls over that time period, getting jacked, making money, going to my dream school. I was glad all that happened, but it made me respect her so much more because she had a purpose in her life. When I was with her, I also got closer to God and slowly drifted away after. She than got a boyfriend about a year and a half after the breakup (Summer 2023), this is right before I actually went to usc on campus and I had a final breakdown crying. At that point I had already been somewhat over it but when she got a boyfriend it forced the final tears out of me one last time because there was no more of her testing me and checking on me for a while. I asked her if they had sex yet and she said no because she’s saving herself again, and that hurt more than if she just did. She just never did wrong somehow.

Time at usc: Now this is August 2023, I pledge a frat and end up dropping towards the end. I made a lot of friends now and my life would consist of going to class, drinking 4 days a week and going to my friends frats because I am a very social guy and still knew a lot of people. At this point I was genuinely over her and wanted the best for her anyways. While it wasn’t as frequent I would still get contacted by her and she starts asking me random questions all the time like “she needs help with a class”, “did you have sex after we broke up”, “do you want a pet for your apartment”, etc. I responded to her still but not out of a place of need or desperateness. A month of two would go by in between each and I never questioned it. I would just answer and move on. While I still did get random thoughts of her and would occasionally check her instagram and whatever I followed her on. I wouldn’t feel the emotions I used to feel. But I still do get those thoughts today to check on her occasionally but only like once or twice a month. Anyways, at usc, I proceed to get distracted my first year and end getting with 30+ girls over the span of a year. I had some ability to do that and also make girls extremely obsessed with me. And I felt bad for doing it because I just don’t feel the same way about them. Girls would cry to me, write about me and share what they wrote. They just can’t understand me supposedly. I would just never commit to anything because of this first love theory. I didn’t believe if until I experienced it, but every girl I talk to I always relate back to my ex. And when they did something that my ex wouldn’t do, it became unattractive to me. It’s not even that I wanted my ex anymore, it’s just that she set the standard. While some of these girls were dimes, I still didn’t care, I couldn’t see myself with them seriously. But yes, my ex would still check on me without saying anything like “I miss you”. She would no caller ID me and call me and then tell me it wasn’t her even though I thought it was because, only she would do that back in the day. Long story short, I maintained a similar lifestyle present day, only more calm and focused on my career now

Present day: almost three years later. A year and a half being broken up, and about a year and a couple months of her dating that guy. I am now 21 and she is now 20

Ironically a week or two before our anniversary in February 2025. She breaks no contact of about 6 months of no talking by having her friend ask me a question about some random topic. I found it strange because I haven’t talked to her friend (F20) since high school, so i instantly found it suspicious. After talking to her friend, she says nothing about my ex. She was Just asking for advice. Later that day I see on the friends story that they were together. Than I just thought it was funny because I know my ex set that up or wanted to hear my voice indirectly. Again I move on. She  then starts ramping up on the no caller ids and then text me she needs help with finance or whatever she would come up with. All things she could easily search up. She once asked me what NPV was through text. Then we slowly start talking, no romantic feelings involved. After all the time she seemed to have gained respect again. We end up talking on phone because I was helping her with homework and never once brought anything of the past or anything. Caught her up on my life and listened to her (She still does not know I have been with any girls or what I have become, I told her pretty much the truth in my own way that paints a good picture of myself because I have changed now, I’d rather just keep that past to myself). Didn’t even know if she still had a bf. Just being a friend. Well she also never mentioned anything of the past, not her boyfriend,or anything about us in the past. Next thing you know, I find out that her and her bf broke up. I was kinda surprised because the dude was a good dude but I guess he dmed another girl and she broke up with him. Also, I used to see that they were planning wedding Pinterest boards, so I assumed it was really serious. Anyways, we end up meeting up for coffee. We Catch up in person, we had good genuine conversations and she told me all about church, going to the gym, whatever. No mention of past from either of us and then she also told me all those no caller ids were her and she was laughing. we met up for around two hours wasn’t awkward at all and I said I had to leave. If I had to describe how she was in the interaction, I would say that she was just also meeting up with me and curious, no flirty behavior. She’s not a very flirty person in general. She wasn’t overly excited to see me, it was just like a normal interaction between friends. I kinda teased her a few times but nothing crazy. After the meetup, I didn’t think much of it. I have completely rid of all neediness because I had my own life and goals now. She ended up contacting me in the past month, probably about once or twice a week, asking me for help on other things, homework or whatever. And most recently she had a project where she needed to interview a specific ethnicity of people and asked if I knew anyone and I said yeah and connected them. And now she said that her group is gonna give gift cards to the people who participated in the survey and that she wants to give them to me to give to my friends. That’s where it’s at today and she actually just texted me as I’m writing this that she might need one more because her group can’t find one more person lol. But anyways, I don’t feel needy towards it. I don’t really know what’s happening. I do know that I probably would say yes to getting back with in the future, but as if it is something completely new. I also don’t mind if it doesn’t work out either because I also want the best for her, I’m not really looking into it to much honestly. But objectively, I can see that it is kinda the same thing that happened in the past, except I just don’t have a negative reaction towards it. I have been positive and fun to be around again. Not stressful or needy. I still am confused why she always chooses to ask me for help, but I don’t react. 

With that information, I still would prefer to be with her in the future and I feel like it could work out but idk how to pursuit it from here. This is why I need advice and for people to tell me what they can observe. Right now my plan is to keep going on about my life, being happy, and working towards my goals, and if she decides to show romantic interest again, we’ll take it from there and create something new. Who knows maybe I end up not being interested. The only reason I’d consider any of this is because she never did any wrong or hurt me. I don’t believe she ever hurt me before, I hurt myself by getting complacent and being needy. Describing her interest level is kinda tough though. It’s in the middle of what it’s been in the past, meaning she’s not obsessed, she’s not thinking of me as a suck up, she’s just kinda there, testing again, seeking validation again maybe? The reason I think it could work also is because her social life involves church and work mostly, she commutes to school and isn’t very involved and doesn’t go out. While it is possible she could be using me for strictly validation again, I doubt it. Even if that’s the case, I don’t think I would be too affected by it. I hope it’s not that because It would be nice to start over with her again. But I do understand that she is not the only girl in the world and there could be someone better. I just don't want to dive in and start asking her to see her more if she is just seeking validation. I don't want to make the same mistake as before. In my head, i believe that she will come back with enough test of hers. but i'm not sure. 

# TLDR:

**We started dating in early 2020, when I was 16 and she was 15. Our relationship went through multiple breakups and reconciliations, for silly reasons. After our final breakup in April 2022, I worked on improving myself, getting in shape, and achieving personal goals. She kept playing me for 1.5 years after breakup. she gets a bf for another 1.5 years. during and after her new relationship, she started reaching out intermittently, asking for help with schoolwork and random questions. We met up once, but there was no mention of the past, and the interaction felt like a normal, friendly catch-up. Now, she’s been texting me occasionally, but I’m unsure if she’s still interested romantically or just seeking validation. I’m not desperate to get back with her, but I would consider it if the opportunity arose, as I respect her and believe we could start fresh.** 

**Questions:**

**What can you observe from her behavior in the present day that would allow me to figure out whether to pursuit or not?**

 **what are some patterns  you can see from me or her that would suggest that there is a chance or not a chance?** 

**If there are good signs, how can I take this relationship from barely talking once or twice a week, to going on a date again without moving too fast? keep in mind that she has still not showed any flirty or romantic behavior, just simply keeps coming back.**

Yesterday the brew head wasn't heating up and red light kept flashing. Turns out the thermal switch had tripped, and resetting it helped keep it running again

This morning all worked great. Brewed my coffee and back to usual. However even after having it switched off for an hour +, the brew pressure guage is still showing 2.5-3 bars

As we moved down the street, it was calm, it felt like we walked for miles, just chatting and enjoying the sights and sounds of life, we moved back through the park, the sun was starting to come down, settling itself in for the evening. 

She had a calm demeanor about her, I don’t think I had ever seen that happy or content. It was good to see, When she was around him, she seemed stressed, I never approached her while they were together out of respect, but I could feel the energy and it felt like she didn’t really want to be with him. I guess maybe I was over thinking a bit, sprinkled with a bit of wishful thinking. 

But she was calm, like she could take on the world again, knowing someone was there right behind her. Maybe that was peace of mind enough. I couldn’t say. I didn’t want to pry, I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and push her worries off to the side, if even it was only briefly. 

“So I know you want to do this dinner thing, and I’m still down for it, but I was gonna run home, shower quick, and take care of laundry at my place, week is about to start and I wanna have my Ts crossed and I’s dotted.” 

“Wow, are you in my head? I was thinking the same thing. How about that ☺️” 

“Possibly, but not really, did you have any pressing issues before tonight?” 

“Nope, my laundry is done and I’m ready for the week.” 

“Okay awesome, then will you do a favor for me quick? Do you mind? If it’s too much, no worries I’ll take care of it.” 

“What’s up?” 

“Here take my debit card, do you want to run to the store and pick up some groceries? Stuff for tonight?”

She gave me a look of confusion..

“Are you sure? That’s a lot.”

“Yea I trust ya, figured we could kill two birds with one stone type deal, if you’re not comfortable with it, that’s fine, I’m fairly quick, so I can make the trip while laundry is going.” 

“No it’s okay I got it, but wow.” 

“Hehe” I couldn’t help but giggle, but I trusted her at this point. However I wasn’t trying to just barge my way into her life, or make any expectations of her, given everything else going on, it might have been a little much. 

“What’s the pin?” She said as she reached her hand out to me.

“0000, I know creative right?” 

“I wasn’t going to say anything but that feels like a you thing to do 😂” 

“Yea I like to keep it simple.” 

“Same” she gave a smile and a wink. “So what time were you thinking?” 

“Well it’s 5:30 now, how about 8? Gives us both some time apart, but not for long.” 

“I like that idea, don’t get me wrong, I enjoy your company, but space is always good too”

“Exactly!” I said in a relieved manner. 

“Get what you want, it’s on me.” 

“Are you sure? I’m not gonna owe you anything after am I?” 

“Well maybe a kiss, but you got kids, I wouldn’t want to just expect you to shell out of your pocket, especially when little ones are involved.” 

“Well what about you?” She asked? 

“My kids are fine, they got lots to choose from, if I was worried I wouldn’t have offered.” 

At this point I’m not sure if she wanted to hug me, break down and cry or what, but her energy shifted, I felt it. 

“You’re nuts you know that right?” 

“I wouldn’t say nuts, just empathetic and understanding, As I said always at your pace” 

“You keep saying that, I know what you mean, but why?” 

“Because I would never put you in a position to make you uncomfortable, and if I do, let me know so I can change it, I am terrible at hint’s plus I’m kinda traditional in some ways when it comes to.. what ever this is. I pay for food, etc. yea a little old school but it has its place I think.” 

“Do you want anything specific while I’m out? 

“Not that I can think of, get what ya want, I gotta run and take care of some stuff, see ya in a while?” 

“Yea.. a while😘” 

I made sure to get her back to her place, giving her a kiss as I left, she had a look of longing and wonder in her eyes as I walked back home. 

I hurried back as quick as I could, plans were set and I got to work, I stripped, got into the shower and cleaned up quick, making sure to trim myself up in the process. Scratchy face isn’t much fun, especially for the opposite sex, no matter where you’re kissing. 

Once I hopped out of the shower, I got a text from her, “hey I’m at the store do you want any kind of coffee for the morning?”

“Ohh yea, will you grab some hazelnut coffee and creamer, I have a thing for it. Lol”

“Sure thing, anything else?” 

“Naa, can’t think of anything, thank you!” 

“You’re welcome. See you soon.” 

I quickly got my laundry in the washer, did a few chores around the house and basically waited for a little while, there was little more I could do, I’ll have to admit I felt bad thinking about it, she was out shopping and I was sitting down doing the “hurry up and wait” game. 

I had about another hour and a half to go. Things were running smooth. The only thing I could do was be patient. 

With that I put on the TV, waiting on laundry and for 8 to get here sooner rather than later.. ",1,1744333416.0,u_Firm_Project7756,0,1.0,False

1jwds7i,https://i.redd.it/mrpjsrthu3ue1.jpeg,Would you want to live on The Lane?,"This is my comfort show for many reasons and I have always thought that Fairview would be such an idyllic place to live, even thought there's those bad things that happen there too. All these families moved there for a reason and, despite everything, still loved to live there. I think that says something. 

I love the feeling of calling your neighbors your friends. They could depend on eachother and created such a strong sense of community. 

I also feel strongly connected to Fairview because I live about 20 minutes away from the Universal Studios Lot! 😆 Yes, I've done the studio tour of Wisteria Lane, but more than that, I drive past many of there ""hangouts"" pretty regularly: 
1.  The Coffee Cup coffee shop (Priscilla's Coffee). you can even see Bob's Big Boy across the street in one of the episodes if you really look for it. 
2. the antique shop Orson visits trying to find the brooch (Victorian Rose Antiques) now closed. 
3. the mall that Gaby models the car on display and ditches Juanita in the dressing room (Fashion Square).
4. the diner Linette gets mad at Kayla in and ditches her sister and mother (Tallyrand).
5. the banquet hall Susan's mom has the wedding rehearsal in (the old Sportman's Lodge on Ventura).
6. the restaurant Susan does her karaoke ( the Smokehouse).
7. the restaurant Bree almost kills Rex in and where Susan rides the mechanical bull (Saddle Ranch).

I feel very fortunate to live this close to Fairview and it just makes me feel like it could really be a real city that neighbor's mine. And sometimes that's a really good escape I crave, like ""let me drive over and play some poker with the girls today.""
