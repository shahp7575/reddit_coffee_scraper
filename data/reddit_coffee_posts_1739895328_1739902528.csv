Hello, I'm planning on re-doing my small living room with new decor and furniture. The house was built in the 1950s and later renovated so the room is set up a bit awkwardly, with the 2 doors at one corner and the hallway entrance on the opposite wall. The dimensions of the room are 13.5 feet by 12.5 feet. I cannot move my gas heater but pretty much everything else is fair game. 

I wanted to go for a more mid-century/maximalist look, with warmer wood tones, thrifted furniture/wall decor and pops of color to contrast with the millennial gray carpet and walls the house was renovated with. I was planning on getting a new TV stand, bookcase, coffee table and possibly a couch. For the TV stand I was going to get a warmer toned wood, mount the TV, put my speakers on either side of the TV stand and use the stand to house my stereo equipment. I want to get some ceiling-to-floor curtains for the window but was unsure on the style and color. I had a big Persian rug in mind for the floor to go under the couch

I'd welcome any feedback or recommendations for curtains, how to space the furniture so the room doesn't feel cramped, wall decor or anything else really. Thank y'all in advance.",1,1739902320.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Rally to support public post secondary education in Ontario

* Wednesday, February 19th, noon to 1:30pm
* Mohawk College Fennell Campus, in front of the EA building on Fennell Avenue

Join Mohawk faculty, support staff and students to call out the Ford government's underfunding and privatization of Ontario's public colleges. Under Ford, Ontario continues to have the lowest level of per-student post-secondary funding in Canada. In addition, colleges rely on a growing number of part-time faculty and support staff, which hurts the quality of education and reduces student services. 

In the face of a financial crisis caused by reduced international student enrollment, Ford is leaving colleges to cut programs and lay off hundreds of faculty and support-staff province-wide. Important programs are being lost, and public colleges are moving further away from their mandate to support local communities and economies and to make post-secondary education widely accessible.

Speakers at the rally will include OPSEU-SEFPO President J.P. Hornick, Mohawk college faculty, support staff, and students, local politicians, and community partners.

Coffee, hot chocolate and snacks will be served. It will be a cold day, so dress warm!

Let's make supporting Ontario's public colleges an election issue!",0,1739902306.0,mohawkcollege,0,0.5,False

I traded a kitchen scale to this bagail that was on sale on Amazon, by experience you need a coffee scale, way more precise and consistent. I’m so happy i tried this bomber puck screen because i was reading its almost 60/40 people that loves them vs people doesn’t see any difference. I’m with the 60 % because i saw the difference right away (water distribution which increases the taste, dryer puck and clean head). The puck screen always sticks the the ground puck but i saw someone that had a good idea to use a magnet so I’ll be trying that soon. Tried my new pesado kit for the first time this morning wich the new bottomless portafilter with the high efficiency 18-20g basket and the wdt that matches. They’re not cheap but honestly worth it. I feel the quality of the products, very sturdy and i love the look. To use the h/e basket i had to go finer again so I’m at the finer settings of this machine 1 and 1. I know apparently it’s not ideal to max it out but it’s the only way i get my grind fine enough to get my 1:2 ratio. This coffee came out so good, i felt i was sitting at a cafe in Italy watching the fountains in a piaza. I have limited space as you can see, when my kids get older I’ll trade-in their play kitchen for a nice coffee counter shelving unit. This breville barista pro is my first semi-automatic machine wich i love! The thermo-jet feature is incredible! It only takes 3 seconds for you water to be hot! So you dont need to wait when you start up the machine. The only con i find is the grinder. When I’ll have my space I’ll definitely go for a eureka mignon or something similar.

My girlfriend (30f) loves coffee, and I (34m) usually make it for her in the evening on Fridays after work since I get home earlier. 


I had a PUBG Battlegrounds night planned with my friends on Discord- for once we actually had a full 4 person team. But I knew as soon as we got a game going she was going to want to spend time together and talk about her day, and we were probably not going to get a chance to dominate in ranked quads. 


So, instead of the usual routine, I swapped her regular coffee with decaf, and added a heavy scoop of CBD plus some melatonin supplements.  I kept saying I would be down after this game for like 3 games and then she was out like a light and we absolutely crushed as a team.

Basically, what I planned to do was volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary that's also a hostel and let's you stay there. It said when I booked it that they give you 3 meals a day as well, and a welcome package with a few gifts 

I'm here now 
I felt pretty horrible about it all before I left the UK, and when I was on my flight to San Jose, I was told really last minute that the hostel was overbooked even though I'd booked a place months ago. A driver took me to the hotel, and when I got there, it was not in good shape. The coffee machine is absolutely dirty with hairs in it and it's sticky to pick up, the drawers on the wardrobe are hanging off, 3 out of 9 lights in the room will actually work, there's not any hot water, and there's actually been tons of insects in the bed, like where I'm supposed to lie down and sleep. More about the bed, there's not a duvet, so I covered myself with a blanket to sleep. I was freezing and there isn't any heating in my room. There is a bath in the room, that also has no got water, and I actually found it with pubes on it.

Also, because I was told there'd be 3 meals a day, I haven't been given any breakfast, any dinner at all. 

Outside the hotel room, while I'm walking outside, people on motorbikes have been rude and held their fingers up at me and staring a lot while I'm just minding my own business. 

And there's this feeling in me that I don't know how to describe but I want to leave. I feel absolutely sick to my stomach being here, and I miss my routine back where I live
It probably sounds really stupid but at home I have a routine where I look after my mental health and try really hard to show myself kindness and look after my body, and coming here I'm not really able to stay in my routine and I think that's part of what's making me feel awful

I feel dreadful in my stomach and want to go back where I actually feel a bit welcome
I also didn't see that welcome package 

I don't even feel like I'm up for eating anything anyway, and can barely work myself up to leave the room

My cashback strategy for groceries:
I obviously use receipt hog and receipt jar and checkout 51. I earned about $40 last year from these apps alone.
 However I also want to add in one called coin miles. I have just recently started using it within the last couple of weeks but already got $5 cashback. They have essentially partnered with businesses to give you cashback for purchasing gift cards through the app. It gives you about 2% cashback at walmart and a ton of other places. However I think this is for canadians only unfortunately. 

Gift cards/ other free stuff
I use the bing rewards app daily to try and redeem them for gift cards. Currently saving up for the boston pizza gift card at the moment and halfway there. 
I also want to note if you have more than 2 services with Telus you pay for, you can redeem them for gift cards or other free items. I recently redeemed a $50 gift card for a restaurant just for paying my telus bill every month. 

Crypto stuff:
I currently collect coin marketcap diamonds everyday, coin gecko candy everyday, and crypto rank rockets everyday. You can redeem them for discounts on items like vpn services, and various other items. 
Crypto.com app has a daily missions checker where you earn one diamond everyday for logging into the app and you can then use those diamonds once you get 25 of them to open up a mystery box that gives you cro tokens (crypto coms native token)  it's not much but gives me a couple of extra dollars a month. 
Shakepay shake sats, I do not currently do this but I see plenty of canadians love this services and it's something I'm looking to add to. 

Miscellaneous canadian apps:
Blossom social app: You connect your investment account to the app, and then they give you lessons you can complete for money. I have earned $20 so far this year and have improved my knowledge on investing. 
I also farm a ton of crypto airdrops but I will not be sharing any specific ones as it's hard to know which ones will be profitable or not. 
Genius cash: They essentially give you cashback and a significant amount for signing up for exchanges or bank accounts. They offer up to $60 I've seen just for say opening up an investment account like quest trade and depositing money there. It is a great solution to get extra money for just signing up for various accounts. 
Tim hortons pick your players: you essentially pick what players you think are going to score a goal in the nhl that day and if you get 7 days correct in a row you get free coffee for a week. 
Safeway app: pick  what NHL teams you think will win games that week and you will get rewarded special discounts or deals at safeway for getting them right. 
Ama app: I highly recommend every Canadian get this. I  save about 5 times as much as the cost of the membership every year. You get discounts on so many restaurants, mechanic shops, hotel rooms, retail stores, shell gas stations and so much more. Not to mention the free tows you get every year it is honestly a no brainer for me to renew every year. 

I did not post any referral links for a reason. I do not want your money I simply want to help people get extra money. I made this post because I enjoy helping people with their finance and nothing more. If i missed anything you feel I should add or do everyday let me know in the comments below.

Guys, I (25 yo woman) started working out regularly again starting January 2025 (after 6 months break). I was working out regularly from March to June 2024. Throughout January 2025, I did regular Pilates and although it made my body sore at times, I did not feel that fatigued. However, I have been doing gym (strength training) from Feb 1st and I feel so so tired and sleepy after gym. Here is what my day looks like these days: 

Currently, I am preparing for a test so I have more flexibility with my daily routine

7:30 to 8:00 am = Wake up  
8:00 to 8:30 am = Get ready for gym + Coffee  


**9:00 to 12:00 = Fasted workout**  
I work out with my cousin and we stretch, take breaks, learn new workouts so it takes time and I do about 8 different exercises per workout day (Sun-Sat: pull, push, legs, pull, push, legs, rest), abs on alternate days.   
  
12:00 to 1:00 pm = Lunch (pretty big and filling)  
1:00 to 3:30  pm  = Nap (2-3 hr of nap). I feel so sleepy and tired that I have to take a nap.   
4:00 to 1:00 am.  = Study (7- 8 hrs of studying)  
(quick dinner around 8:00)  


1:00 to 8:00 = Sleep (\~7 hrs of sleep)  
  
Wake up at 7:30/8:00...Repeat...

I feel like I am getting enough sleep.   
I am definitely eating enough and healthy for the most part (home cooked meals)  
I am also drinking enough water.   
I don't think I am training too hard either. Just right. Pushing myself but going extreme.

  
**My problem: Why do I feel like crashing after gym/lunch? Even after I take a nap, although I feel quite awake, my energy level seems a bit low. I am not as productive/energetic while studying as I would like to be... or as I was during the 6 months break when I was NOT working out.** *What do you think I am doing wrong? What do I need to change?* 

My hypothesis: 

1. Fasted workout is affecting me? However, even on days when I did have oatmeal or something before working out, I still wanted to crash post-workout?

2. Although I am sleeping enough hours, my quality of sleep has not been great?

3. Since I am doing strength training after a long time, my body is adjusting/recovering and feeling more fatigued/tired/sleepy?

4. My cousin I work out with, for some reason, is always low in energy and I wonder if that is affecting me as well. She always has that stressed out/low energy look on her face and body language and I wonder if that is affecting me too. 

5. Mental and physical demands. 7-8 hrs of studying + strength training 5 days a week are mentally/physically taxing and energy-consuming so my body feels fatigued.  

Please do let me know if you relate and have done anything that has helped you.

He had sent out invites to the party yesterday, reminding campers that despite Capture the Flag, they could still party with him. He figured that people had something different on their mind with the quest and Hugo’s death - Danny was the same, word of mouth was that his godly dad had visited camp - but he still hoped people would make time for him.

He deserved that.

The cabin doors were wide open, music blaring from the common room. The party was lavish, with almost every popular snack or drink available. A matcha-flavored cake sat atop the coffee table.

Has the whole world gone crazy?. I see people being aggressively pushed aside everywhere I look in the name of some nebulous greater good. It’s not okay. Yes, we abide; we try to find peace in these chaotic times. It’s not enough.  It's not enough to abide when others are suffering at the hands of Nihilists and Fascists. We need to act. We need to stand up and tell these rug-pissers that their aggression will not stand, man. This unchecked aggression throwing so many people out of jobs, making my special lady friend’s job exponentially more dangerous, and scaring the shit out of the little dudes in my classroom. They’re over the line and not just a little slip; they are so far fucking over the line that I feel like something drastic needs to get done. 

Maybe they should discover what happens when they find a stranger in the Alps. (best tv censored line ever).   

When I look and see the Donnies around me who are totally out of their element, hurting and scared waiting to see where all this leads. I know that someone needs to do something to try and help, something to let them know someone sees them and actually cares. 

I want to help. I want to do something meaningful not just toss a bag with my dirty undies. It’s a struggle for sure. It makes me want to scream, hit someone with a bowling ball, and bust up a Corvette. 

I just have to keep telling myself that some days you’re the Dude, some days Donnie, and some days, like today, I’m Walter.  I just hope when I’m out of my element someone is there to fight for me.

1isiz5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/seizures/comments/1isiz5j/did_ginseng_provoke_my_seizure/,Did ginseng provoke my seizure?,"I am a thirty-five year old male, have never had a seizure before (or since) and had a full, blackout, tonic clonic seizure out of the blue two weeks ago. Fell so badly in the process that I fractured my shoulder. In the hospital afterwards I had a clear CT scan, heart ECG, and blood tests (I don't know what they tested for) and the doctor mentioned no issues with any of them. I am still waiting to hear back from the follow up with the neurologist.

I was trying to think about what I did the day of the seizure that could've been different. I drank a lot of caffeine (four coffees plus one tea), but that's fairly typical for me. I also ate quite a lot of sugar (sweets) and skipped lunch- not entirely typical but not very rare for me either. I drank alcohol at the weekend (maybe 7 pints on Saturday and 2 on Sunday), but the seizure happened on a Tuesday afternoon, so I'm not sure if that could've been a trigger? I drink most weekends and don't drink through the week.

Then I remembered one thing I'd done that was completely out of the ordinary: I took ginseng supplements for the very first time. I took 150mg on Monday evening then another 150mg on Tuesday morning, and had the seizure on Tuesday afternoon. This means I had 300mg in the 24 hours before the seizure. I also remembered that I'd felt quite hot/slightly fevery on the first night when I took the ginseng, then slept it off, thought nothing of it and took some more. Could this have been a seixure trigger in someone who's never had a seizure before?

Or is it more likely just a random, unprovoked seizure?

1isiyn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/premedcanada/comments/1isiyn8/things_i_have_noticed_since_joining_just_my_two/,"Things I have noticed since joining, just my two cents.","**Hey, all future healthcare providers!!**

I am new to Reddit/PreMedCan. I'm a mature student who returned to school later in life. Not to date myself too much, but I have been working in acute medicine for nearly 15 years. I have always wanted to study medicine, but life took over. I finally finished my UGE and am in the process of applying to medicine and other related programs.

Like I said, I am likely older than most of you—probably old enough to be your parent. Before discovering this forum, I thoroughly reviewed schools of interest—so much so that I have almost all of them memorized. If there’s one thing medicine has taught me over the years, it's to always be prepared and ready to go, especially in unpredictable environments.

 Medicine has developed a lot of my skills over the years, such as punctuality, responsibility, accountability, teamwork, organization, resiliency, perseverance, and conflict management (believe me, conflict resolution is key).

Medicine can be unforgiving, daunting, exhausting, and intimidating, but there are also many wonderful aspects. Personally, I love interacting with patients and families and the continuous, lifelong learning.

Anyways, like the title says, here are some things I have noticed since joining this forum—and among some of my peers in UGE: 

# 1) Find the answers: There are so many posts asking questions that are clearly answered on school websites. It’s amazing how many students ask about critical application info, like deadlines. Maybe it's the age gap or growing up in a different era, but if you’re not thoroughly combing through the school's website, you are not prepared to apply. Med schools have zero tolerance for incomplete applications or errors.

Deadlines and being prepared are a big part of medicine. If you’re asking obvious questions, you probably need to improve your organization and accountability skills. Take the time to find the answers for yourself, or keep scrolling—someone has definitely asked the same question before.

# 2) “What are my chances?” It’s incredible how often this gets posted. While I understand that medicine is something you’ve always wanted to pursue—and maybe you hit a speed bump along the way—that’s part of life and being a student.

It’s great that students rally together to provide feedback (some of it is great), but a lot of it is negative and toxic. After scanning a few of these posts, I decided never to open them again.

Medicine will test you. It will pull and stretch you beyond your limits sometimes, and you need to be able to weather the storm, develop resiliency, and persevere. Medicine can be unforgiving, and if you don’t develop self-regulation skills, you’re going to have a difficult time.

Although medicine has changed a lot over the years, it still holds onto a ""toughen up"" mentality. If you bombed your first semester, do your homework by talking to your university and getting answers from the source. You need to be able to find solutions in medicine—turning to toxic and negative feedback will only keep your head below water.

# 3) Resiliency and perseverance: I come from an era where there was very little sympathy for whining and meltdowns, maybe it was a cultural thing, I don't know. During UG, I could not believe how many students had breakdowns in hallways, bathrooms, and common areas—or had outbursts toward professors and other students.

It was shocking to see how little emotional regulation some people have. Again, medicine is unforgiving. There is no room for meltdowns or outbursts, and this kind of behaviour will make it incredibly difficult to not only succeed in medicine but also build relationships with co-workers.

It’s one thing to have an emotional moment with your patients, families, or co-workers; it’s another to be immature and entitled. It’s not too late to develop resilience—there are books, professional help, and excellent resources online.

It’s not your fault—it’s your parents! (Haha.) Kid has a meltdown at a grocery store? Give them the iPad. That eventually leads to teenage meltdowns with zero regulation skills. But you can develop these skills if you work at them and take accountability. You are stronger than you think!

# 4) Life experience: I understand that working during UG is tough, especially if you’re chasing that coveted 4.0 GPA. But, there are significant benefits to working on your life skills before entering medicine.

Whether you work in retail, as a summer camp counsellor, or at Booster Juice, you are developing wonderful skills! It also looks great on your application, especially if you come across situations at work that are relatable to medicine, like teamwork.

**""What ECs should I have?""**—another classic post I’ve seen. One thing I’ve noticed from med school admissions sites is that they’re looking for individuals who are unique and stand out.

I have sat through med school interviews. It’s incredible how many students are ""box checkers."" It’s like reading the same paragraph over and over—which leads to a big yawn, followed by a nap.

If your GPA isn’t perfect, work on other aspects of your application that show you are unique and committed to activities outside of the library. Medicine is changing, admissions are changing, and there is no perfect formula. Work on your resume, challenge yourself, take on difficult roles, and develop your character and life experience.

# 5) Know what you’re getting into: Volunteering in hospitals, shadowing a healthcare provider, and volunteering in a senior home are great experiences. But I would argue that they don’t always give you the full picture of what medicine is like.

Working as an orderly, for example, is a great way to see behind the scenes—where you interact with patients, staff, doctors, and families. You haven’t experienced true medicine until all your senses are hit—including all those wonderful smells.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard preceptors tell med/nursing students to find another profession.

It’s okay to be afraid of working in medicine—you should be afraid. It can be incredibly intimidating, and making mistakes is a fear that most healthcare providers share.

Work days, evenings, and the occasional night shift. Get your hands dirty. You may find that medicine isn’t for you. But if you can survive the worst days, the foul smells, bodily fluids, dynamic personalities, and the fast-paced environment, you might just make it.

Med schools will likely value an applicant who rolled up their sleeves and got their hands dirty!

Lastly, being a physician is a calling. The perception of elitism can often be misleading. Behind the scenes, there’s burnout, financial difficulties, political conflicts, and time management struggles. Nothing wrong with working at Booster Juice before applying to medicine—but absolutely know what’s going on behind the scenes. It’s often not as glorious as the shiny Mercedes-Benz in the parking lot.

# 6) There are other professions: If you’ve been rejected from medicine, are struggling with grades, or are deciding between schools (Canadian or international), there are other professions worth considering.

Nursing, NP, PA, and RT are all wonderful careers with a fraction of the baggage.

I’m not trying to sway anyone from applying to med, but it’s not the end of the world if you don’t get in. A lot of students on here openly vent about admissions. Some take it personally, and worse—some feel entitled to a spot because they have perfect stats and can’t understand why they weren’t chosen. (Refer back to #3.)

If you want it bad enough, do what you need to do. But if you’re looking for a rewarding profession that contributes significantly to patient care, there are options. If you value this feedback and advice, great, if you don't, that's okay too. I'm not claiming to know all the answers, but when you rub shoulders with med students, residents, doctors and allied healthcare providers, it's amazing what you can learn from asking about their own experiences. Coffee break chats can be super entertaining and educational. Just my take from the inside. 

Good luck to everyone, I am sure you will all find your place in medicine, one way or another. ",14,1739901555.0,premedcanada,2,0.89,False

1isiuu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1isiuu3/me_or_him/,Me or him?,"Hi, 

  I have been lurking on an incognito tab with this reddit group for almost two weeks. I have tried to go through symptoms of a Narc with Google. I am confused and worried because my brain says my husband (Who I love more than myself and I am not saying he is a horrible person but I am just trying to see if I am not seeing it or maybe I am seeing it differently ) is the narc or me because recently he says it is me that is the narc. And upon seeing the signs  I see a couple points that say I have one or two of the signs of narc disorder. And they say a Narc will deny that it is them or not feel in their mind like it is them. so can I ask here ? If not I will delete this post immediately. I am not trying to gather anyone on my side I am just genuinely wondering if its me.

Also I want to add real quick that he is disabled somewhat and he has eye sight issues  in both eyes ,so its the reason why I feel or have felt like I need to do a lot of the errands and etc . 

  
Me-

\*I do have visions of grandiose success and achievements- I day dream about getting an awesome job and making a lot of money or even being popular in whatever field I day dream about and making a lot of money and getting a house and having so much money we never have to worry about it ever again.

\*I do look in the mirror some- but then I end up picking out my flaws rather than actually liking myself in the mirror

\*I have a collection of clothes and shoes and stuff and I say I am always going to wear them but I never do because sometimes I feel like they wouldn't look good when I wear them.

\* He wants me to workout and get back in to shape and also to wear makeup (for him) every day to show I care ( Because I used to have a job where I would have to wear makeup Every day. I used to be a go go dancer) and he thinks that I don't care about him because I forget to wear make up most of the time and I also forget to workout. -- BUT in my defense - we have kids together and I drive them to school , I pick them up , I go out and do any errands that need doing . I have A.D.D and my brain is always everywhere- I even forget to take my medicine a lot of the time. ---Anyways I forget to do this a lot and he says its because I don't care about him.

\* He has also requested Lingerie-- but again I forget not because I don't care but because I forget. Some nights I am just tired and I have no energy . But I see a lot of relationship therapists say - if they wanted to they would but I just feel so exhausted and tired a lot of the time. Am I still being unreasonable?

\* He is angry with me because I don't have a job in the field I have been studying for. -- There were times I should have been studying but honestly I am either doing all the errands or some days I feel the need to zone out and I will admit it I don't do what I should be doing.  But when he gets angry about this I feel like it is an uncalled for feeling because I am trying the best I can.

  
\* He wants to go out on dates and stuff to be more together -- but I don't have a full time job so he blames me once again for this and says I do not listen to his feelings because he wants to be closer and do things that will make us closer and I must not care because I am not trying my best to get a job so we have money to do these things together.

  
\* I take naps once in awhile because I have depression and he says that I am being lazy like my drug addicted parents and that if I don't try to get a job I will just end up like them. 

  
\* I forget his appointments and medicine  and he says that because I forget his appointments/ Medicine I am selfish and I only care about myself and that I don't even try to do things for him. or try to remember things he needs . 

\* He says I never let him have an opinion or let him make decisions. I do tend to try to do a lot of stuff myself and I try my best to do things to do his way but sometimes it doesn't work out like the way he wants  or expects and then he says its because I don't listen to him. I do procrastinate a lot and I put stuff off because I get anxiety or a fear of failure or sometimes just don't feel like I can.  But he is Adamant and says that I PURPOSLY do not listen to him because I don't care about his opinion.

\* Says I don't care about him because I don't push him to workout or help him remember to do things. He says that he always remembers to tell me to workout or to do things but I never remember to make him workout and if I cared I would make him workout- Yet when I have tried to nicely push him he will reject my idea and say why should he when I don't care - or why should he if I am not going to be doing xyz thing that for some reason depends on his will to workout.

  
\* He says I control the finances and I am trapping him . --- I technically do control the finances but only because I have to pay the bills , go to the stores, get the gas for the car , go out and do my commission job so I can get what ever we need and still we struggle.  So I hold the credit card and the food card so if I am ever out and I need to get something I can get the stuff. I also am the one that pays the bills and I sometimes forget to mention what I have paid or how much money we have (cause sometimes it is 0$ and I don't want him to stress) but I don't withhold it purposely or with malice. At least I don't feel like its purposely.

\*He says the reason he gained so much weight is because I fed him too much and didn't care or notice when he gained weight- I did notice but I felt bad saying anything or bringing it up too often because I felt like it would have been a sensitive subject for him and so I never mentioned it or made it a point to bring up until he asked me if I wanted him to change anything about himself when we had a discussion about how he feels in our relationship. I said I wanted him to be a healthier weight - I never asked for him to have washboard abs or be as skinny as he thinks I want him to be. 

\* If he does something nice for me I sometimes will admit I do not notice or I forget to say thank you. Or even sometimes I do not know what kind of reaction he hopes for but it seems like it is the wrong reaction no matter what. 

\* He says all I do is think about myself-- I don't feel like I do. I wake up get him and I coffee, I take kids to school, I come back and will be either making him food or studying or just sitting next to him spending time with him. I make appointments when I remember, I then will sometimes workout , then I go to pick up the kids and then I come back and I am sitting with him again normally unless I have to go to the store after I pick the kids up. or I will be on the computer doing whatever I can remember or have the energy to do, I also try to clean at least one thing or area if I can or have the mental energy. He never wants to go out with me anywhere yet will be angry when store trips for something take hours.

  
\* lately out of mental breakdown episodes- I have broken some things - I have broken dishes and thrown things as well. I also yelled and screamed and felt at my lowest point but I have broken things too and I know it wasn't right. I even said things to my kids that I would not have said normally If I hadn't felt like I did and I know that was wrong too and I apologize after because I feel bad but I know later they probably will hold it against me. 

\*Sometimes I will admit I feel like I am not interested in intimacy because for most of our relationship it has been a center piece of our arguments. That and his accusations of cheating. I just don't feel sexy after an argument but when we ""make up "" I think he feels like I am the one apologizing so things should go back to normal. and that includes our sexual relationship. And tbh I am normally the one that caves when it comes to arguments.

Husband-

\* argues with me every other day it seems - sometimes for days on end .

\* throws and breaks anything that he wants to get a reaction out of me. A lot of the times its things that I forget to use - like makeup or the clothes he wants me to wear. He has also broken jewelry because I don't wear it everyday. He has broken multiple T.V's that I have had to replace.

  
\* calls me stupid , lazy ,fat (I'm 4'10 and 112 lbs.) . calls me a whore . Accuses me constantly of cheating and has even kept arguments about the cheating he thinks is happening - going on and on until I break and let him have his way and then he never lets it go ever. He seems to even find creative insults. or will insult me but then say he is only trying to help me and that he is only being ""truthful"" and that autistic people are just more blunt and truthful.

  
\* baits me constantly over text if we are arguing - If the argument becomes too much I will admit I ignore him or stone wall him - then he escalates it to me hating him and me not caring about him so he isn't going to do xyz or whatever . 

\* When I threaten to leave he says he will off himself or he says mean things that will get my attention. ( I will admit I have said I was going to off myself also , but for me it honestly was to get him to stop acting how he was acting or arguing with me, sometimes I feel like I can't take it anymore but it's not a good reason either).

\* He blames his outburst and anger issues on having Autism. Before that it was Anxiety and before that it was just him acting like a ""man"" so he wouldn't look like a weak person. 

\* For all of our relationship - the accusations of cheating have been there and mainly because he believes I am not attracted to him and he thinks its either looks or his member or whatever else he thinks is the reason I don't want sex from him and I do want sex but for me its been a constant reason for our arguments from the beginning. So when we argue I am exhausted - or if I have a full day , by 9pm I am exhausted and tired.  Sometimes I feel like I am walking on eggshells wondering if we are going to have an argument that day - and its all focused about sex and lack of. 

 \* On the note of him doing something nice-- sometimes I feel he is nice or does something nice because he expects stuff in return and yet he won't say what reaction or favor he is expecting in return. He sometimes will say he is not expecting anything but at the end of the day when it is night time , If I don't Initiate or start stuff he will get upset and say he is mad that he got or did the thing he did for me and that I don't appreciate him or what he does and he regrets doing it.

  
I don't know if this is too much or what but I felt I could ask here because if I ask my therapist I worry she might be more apt to take my side rather then being truthful on whether I am the narc . I worry maybe because I am in my own head , I don't see it and he is just emotionally reacting?? I love him , I really do and I feel like I am being horrible by wanting to know if its me or him? I just don't know who to ask or where to go. I have been with this man for most of my life. He has a lot of moments where he isn't like this and I feel like we can be normal and happy and make things better once we have the right amount of money, or house or whatever he wants. I just want to figure out if I need to change and be better or idk. I just need some kind of information or direction or something. I won't leave him, and I don't want him to leave me . I can't that literally would tear me apart. But maybe if its me I can fix myself or work to become better emotionally or whatever and maybe he would be less angry about our relationship.

Now, 44 days ago I forced myself to start drinking it black and unsweetened, in an effort to make it less “fun” if you will.  Initially, because I loved light cream in my coffee (and other things depending on availability: maple syrup, hot cocoa mix, ect), I was sleeping better and not consuming as much caffeine, just because I was forcing myself to drink it black.  But, then I quickly acquired the taste for this black coffee and…well, here I am.  Going to the Keurig is like a ritual.

Anyway, just looking for support.  I stumbled upon a YouTube video (don’t even remember which one, likely about a month ago) where the guy suggested getting low dose caffeine pills and not drinking *any* hot beverages at all.  Like, having the cup in my hand is definitely like a security blanket to me, so it made sense to kind of go “cold turkey” on this.  And by taking the caffeine pills and slowly titration down, I should know exactly how much caffeine I’m taking in, rather than guessing.

I just took 4 (25mg each) with my breakfast.  Have ice water to sip throughout the day.  I will take the bottle with me to work.  It’s going to be very very hard.

I’ve had some wins since the new year.  For instance, I would be getting iced coffees from Dunkin’ 1-2 times per day, or being at Starbucks.  I haven’t, made myself stick to the Keurig.  (For the record, I would still hit the Keurig coffee later in the day).  I also haven’t had any coffee in the car, a big one for me, as I loved to sip it in traffic.

This ministry has helped many people reverse Type II Diabetes by switching to a Low Glycemic Edible Whole Food Plant Based Diet full of Low Glycemic Fruits, Vegetables, Beans, Berries, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Root Tubers, NonHallucinagenic Legal Mushrooms, Nuts and Seeds. Google Low Glycemic Fruits and Vegetables. (Genesis 1:29, Daniel Chapter One, Daniel Chapter Ten). Many people make great progress by starting to walk an hour a day. Intermittent Fasting is also helpful, where people Fast 16 hours and only eat in an 8 hour window. Some people have found success only eating One Meal a day.

1isis3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/1isis3k/the_cats_are_gone_i_love_you_daddy/,The cats are gone. I love you daddy.,"My father (63M) was diagnosed with stage 4 pancan in April 2024. Like many mentions from the posts in this sub, life was never the same after diagnosis, no matter how much we tried to hold on and make it stay the same. We opted for natural remedies for reasons I will not elaborate - daddy decided what he thought was best for him and we supported him. I wish there was a different ending to this, but daddy passed a week ago and I miss him so much. As I sit by his favourite chair mourning, I want to channel part of my grief into words by sharing our experience. I want to give back to this community and hopefully provide some solace to other patients/caregivers like how this sub was for me throughout this challenging period.
Shoutout to all of you brave soldiers!

Starting from the diagnosis, it was very unexpected, as with most pancan diagnosis. He was sent to the ER for stomach pain. Xray showed what looked like an indication on the pancreas but the film wasnt clear that the doctor needed a second opinion from an oncologist. However, there was no time, he needed an emergency surgery because his stomach was fully bloated like a balloon about to pop. During the surgery, surgeon did not find anything abnormal on his pancreas or the surrounding organs, only that his appendix had ruptured. Doctor ruled it as appendicitis and had it removed. Daddy recovered quickly and got better, everything went back to normal. Weeks later, the hospital called for follow up. apparently the doctors took his appendix for post mortem and found presence of cancer cells. CA19-9 of about 3000. Endo showed clear, no masses. Xray could not conclude as well, but the report still states stage 4 pancan mets to appendix. I try not to but blame the doctors here for the lack of clarity and advice. There was no definite explanation that daddy had cancer at all. We were all confused for so long even after seeing different doctors.. until he became unwell again.

By unwell, I am referring to all the vomiting. Large volumes of vomit multiple times a day. However he appeared normal. No jaundice, no weight loss, no pain, which confused the doctors I guess. Then came another rush to the ER where they had to perform another emergency surgery. This time they opened up to a slew of polyps covering around his small intestines. They had to bypass 3 sections of his intestines since they were severely blocked and installed a stent. After the procedure, we was able to swallow food again without vomiting. 

 We started the natural remedy protocols immediately after. He was mostly alright with the same symptom (stomachache) but again that was it, which the hospital prescribed Gaviscon for, and did help soothe the pain. Months later, the large volume vomiting started again. On top of that, he had diarrhoea several times a day. Daddy's weight plummeted here on. He went from eating rice congee three meals a day with cold pressed juice to absolutely nothing at all. Not even water. We thought the end is near. Someone said as rule of thumb to estimating a person's remaining life ""if you see changes in months, they have months left; if you see changes in days, they have days left."" This is very true.

We saw changes every month how daddy's eating habits changed, then came every week how his energy levels changed. Fast forward to the period when daddy's condition deteriorated daily, I believe many who experienced would agree that it is one of, if not the most traumatising. One that etched in my mind was when he started vomiting non stop in the wee hours of the morning. Black/brown vomit with mixture of coffee grounds all over the mattress and the floor. Again and again, never ending. His eyes turned white for a second and when they turned back he started screaming. My mother holding his frail body in her arms panic and trying her best to comfort him while I called the ambulance. Amidst the crying and screaming, my heart went numb. Needless to say, It was the last time daddy was home. Mummy went to with the ambulance first while we cleaned up the home and following after. When he reached the ER, his blood pressure was low and he was begging me to bring him home. I told him that I could only bring him home after he has stabilised. He was shivering despite having multiple blankets on. He told me not to have the doctors experiment on him, I nodded and waited with him. At this point, he could no longer walk nor was he eating anymore. He had three small sips of water a day and refused anything else.

Daddy wasn't the easiest to take care of. He got pretty mean the next two days at the hospital and was extremely rebellious. He was actively removing all his tubes, getting incredibly restless and aggressive, like a different person altogether. All our relatives came to see him. On the first day he could still form cohesive sentences. Everyday his vocabulary seems to shrink. Words turn to rambles and mixture of yelling. He got quieter in the evening and on the last day he just stopped making sounds altogether. Along the days, he's also eventually stopped asking for water, issues with excretion, started vomiting again despite anti vomit meds, reduced awareness of surroundings, stopped recognising us - all these changes in a span of 5 days. One shocking observation was that after he died, his back was entirely purple when we flipped him over for cleansing.

Anyway, that was a quick writeup on the progression of this cruel disease. Before I end this post, i'd like to just explain the title, which was based on a very interesting observation. Towards the last few months, we had several cats visiting the house. Most were strays, and one had a collar. They don't ask for food or actively seek us. They just happen to exist. Earlier in the night when daddy was rushed to the ER the cats sat outside our main door and peeking through the glass panels by the door. When i walked towards the glass, they just calmly walked towards me first before walking away. Today, these cats no longer come over anymore. 

I am grateful that daddy is no longer suffering. He left peacefully without any struggle and complains of pain. My thoughts and prayers to all of you going through this right now. It is not easy, and I hope yours turn out better. Be strong, take care and stay safe.

Fear ruled over every aspect of my life. I avoided public spaces because people would stare at my son. I was convinced everyone hated me and I was completely and totally withdrawn from society. I refused to go to grocery stores, go outside, order coffee for myself. 
My therapist taught me to be more compassionate towards myself and that changed everything. I learned it was okay to have awkward interactions, not be perfect, and that failure was okay. 
Over time, the fear that once ruled over my life became much more subtle. I learned to accept realities I have no control over. And I ended the cycle of self blame around my SA. 
Five years of therapy, not only gave me tools to cope with life struggles it helped me become a better human.

I’ve really been at the lowest of lows. I know this is long, I’m sorry. I just need to vent I guess. 

I don’t understand why I miss him. I’m truly grieving the worst I ever have. I have enrolled in therapy and have had two sessions, and will continue to have more. I’m just in a really dark place. I’ve had 3 long term relationships since 2016. 1st one in my teens, I moved across the country in with ex no. 1 and he was cheating the entire time. So I left him and moved home in 2020. Second relationship my ex no. 2 was physically abusive and went to jail for it, and was an alcoholic. This ended January 2023. Now onto my ex fiancé. We met in October of 2023. 

(26 F) my ex fiancé (33 M) proposed to me in December on a trip he paid for to the Bahamas for us. We were dating only 1 year. My mom is a hoarder, and I couldn’t hide this from him. So he was unable to ever come inside the house. When he found out, he offered me to move in with him within the first 2 months. 

I was appealed by him owning his own trucking small business, having a house, not being an alcoholic, a cheater, or abusive. he told me all he wanted was “the 3 Fs. feed me, f*ck me, and be faithful”. All of the things I was happily doing. And he never had complaints with. I felt like I finally found a good hardworking man. My last two exes couldn’t even hold jobs. 

Back to the proposal: he proposed about 1 year 1 month after we met. It was last minute, rushed, & he didn’t have a ring. He also confessed to me the day before proposing when he was drunk that he had a crippling 🌽 addiction, which was why he didn’t propose to me on the Bahamas trip yet. He felt he needed to tell me that. I was hurt. But I told him even though I set a boundary at the beginning of our relationship with that, we’d work through it and I’d support him. And I was proud of him as he was honest & vulnerable. The very next day he proposed and told me he was going to an hour beforehand. It was not a surprise at all. He paid $1,000 for photos and everything and told this big story to everyone about how he was running around frantically trying to make this happen. But we never told anyone that it wasn’t a surprise to me. 

When we got home from our trip, we started arguing right away pretty bad. We had some big arguments leading up to the trip as well, but it got out of control after we returned. Here is a list things that were new issues and also a few ongoing over the course of our relationship: 

- He had his mom give me her 10 yr anniversary ring that didn’t fit and was dirty. Please know money was not an issue. His mom has overstepped boundaries many times and was very hot and cold with me. She suggested this ring being given to me. I was supposed to receive an heirloom from his grandmother but she is not on talking terms with his mom. So this ring was the second choice. apparently she told him “she didn’t like it at first but it grew on her”. 
- His mom insisted he take her and his dad’s wedding vows for our wedding ???? Another example of overstepping.
- He called me materialistic and selfish for asking him if I could buy my own daily moissanite ring to wear, and wear his moms on occasions. Bc this ring wasn’t my style and was bulky. He took the ring from me and gave it back to her bc I asked about this (she was the one who suggested wearing it on occasion!)
- Refused to help take HIS dog out that he got before being with me. Refused to take her on walks. Ignored her on a daily basis. She regularly had accidents if I didn’t take her out for him. In his defense he did work a lot and was busy, but he is slow 4 months out of the year and even then sat and played video games and ignored taking her out so I almost always did it. 
- I asked him if he could help take his dog out at night. I did all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, lunches, etc. bc I moved in with him rent free. But I was in school full time and working remotely full time. I have a crippling fear of the dark, and the rural area we lived in a lot of homeless people are around. He told me I needed to get over my fear and “why did I move to the woods with him if I’m afraid of the dark”. Instead of helping me take her out when he was home, he got me a flashlight so I could see better and take her out for him. While he plays video games or sits on his phone. 
- Left his dirty laundry for me to pick up for him, with c*m stains all over his underwear after he went and ran errands. On CHRISTMAS EVE. Meaning he did that in PUBLIC somewhere in his truck 
- I told him in the middle of an argument that it hurt my feelings he didn’t plan anything for my birthday last year but I planned a surprise party for him. Not mature of me to bring that up in an argument. But I was really upset. He then reluctantly planned 2 hours at top golf with our friends. After planning this, he canceled the plans because I wanted to spend the day after with him, too, which caused an argument (the day after was my ACTUAL birthday). Why? Bc he wanted to go to a fishing show with his parents on my actual birthday. I supported him going, even though I did say I was a little disappointed. But I asked him if he could go earlier with his parents, so he could make my bday dinner with my family. He said “his mom sleeps in on Sundays she told him that already, and they won’t be working around my schedule. He doesn’t need to go”. So I told him he puts her feelings above mine. This led to him calling her, screaming at me on the phone, her agreeing with him, and both of them telling me I had to leave that night with my important stuff. He refused to let me stay even a few days. He said I could get the rest of my things on my birthday, and had to have everything out within 5 days. This is illegal in my state, I lived with him and received mail. But I did leave right away that night bc I was afraid. This was a few weeks ago. 
- Doesn’t brush his teeth, had a tooth rotting in his mouth I had to beg him to brush and he still wouldn’t do it! Not exaggerating he had brushed his teeth less than 10 times our entire relationship 
- Doesn’t like to go out of the house much, which is fine. And I understood that from the beginning. I am not a party girl, I like being at home. But it was difficult to get him to even go to friend get togethers, weddings, he would often cancel last minute bc he didn’t feel like going, after telling me we had plans that weekend. Which I looked forward to, to get out of the house and be around people. So I felt disappointed a lot, and isolated. 
- “Accidentally” went to a bikini barista stand with a friend of his and told me months later. Thought I’d “be mad”. I didn’t get upset but this did build some resentment for me 
- Gives silent treatment after every argument. I would still cook for him, do his laundry, make his bed, lay his clothes out, make his lunches REGARDLESS of any argument. But he would come in the room and ask me to stop “he doesn’t need anyone to do that for him. He did it himself for 33 years”. 
- I would make dinner after arguments like normal, and he would refuse to eat it. And I’d say alrighty then. And then when I’d leave the room he would get a plate of food. 
-  Would call his friends and badmouth me every single argument. I found this out later from a friends wife. She said before our trip after an argument where I could see him looking at women on his phone, I stormed off and went into the bathroom and cried. This reaction of mine he told his friend made him “question proposing” and told his friend he was not going to anymore. His action wasn’t the issue, it was of course me crying and storming off. This was the beginning of him deflecting every single issue we had onto me. 
- Regularly threatened to cancel the Bahamas trip he paid for. It was $9k total for two of us. He owns his own business so he had some extra money from a work accident to afford this trip. Every argument I was threatened, even a few days before we left 
-  I paid for our groceries, which were expensive as he was picky and only wanted organic meat and veggies. $500 / month I was spending on two for food, hygiene products for him, toilet paper, and random cleaning supplies, etc. I also would often buy us coffee or breakfast. He did too, but more often than not I would insist. And he wanted lots of variety in meals, snacks, he was very picky. Wanted me to cut the stems off his spinach, broccoli, would give criticism over my cooking, how cheese was melted on his eggs, etc 
- Told me he wished I had a bigger butt, and would compliment me every time I lost weight. Mind you I’m 5’4 140 lbs, hourglass 
- Encouraged me to withdraw from school, didn’t support me when I asked him if he could help me with some house work so I could accelerate my degree. I offered to cut my work hours, still pay the groceries but help him with his paperwork in my spare time to make up for anything I fall short on so I could finish my degree in 6 months. That’s all I wanted. 6 months. And I’d keep cleaning, cooking, everything if he would help me through that time. After talking to his mom about it, he decided that “it doesn’t make sense for me to be in school if I want to be a mom one day”. He wanted kids, wanted them homeschooled, and refused to even consider private schooling. He wanted me to do it all
- Told me I’d never have access to his bank acct, he would give me an allowance once were married. His business and personal account is all in one, that was his reasoning 
- He said if he ever got divorced even if we just fell out of love, he wouldn’t give me a penny because I was a stay at home mom and homeschool mom, I didn’t work so I didn’t deserve anything
- Said he would kick his kids out as soon as they turn 18
- Says men are “simple creatures without expectations of women” and that women are all materialistic and have unrealistic expectations of men
- We had two hobbies—snowboarding and video games. Snowboarding was fine as we are both beginners. But video games he would wine and accuse me of stealing loot the entire game. And then intentionally do it to me to antagonize me. This is a small issue but it did cause pathetically big arguments 
- Would brag about how he had slept with “hundreds” of women over the years and how easy single moms were. And how he could ignore their stretch marks but he wouldn’t lie to them and pretend they’re beautiful when they’re not. Like what’s the point of even saying that…???
- Wouldn’t let me drink unless he was drinking. Would control how much I could (1 to 2 seltzers max, one mixed drink max). I respected this but felt frustrated I could only drink when he was okay with it. I could never make that decision myself. On my birthday the year before I got pretty drunk with his friend’s girlfriend, both my ex and her bf took us bar hopping. My ex was pissed and held this over my head for months. Mind you, I didn’t act a fool, messy, throw up, nothing. We were just having a good time, laughing and talking. That’s it; nothing bad happened. He was mad I drank in general. But I felt horrible about this, and I didn’t mean to drink too much. It was my birthday and everyone was buying me shots. I had to apologize to him for months for this. Because the DAY before my birthday 2024, a mutual of his passed away from a gastric bypass surgery related issue. But, he was also an alcoholic. So my ex decided ON my birthday the day after his mutual died, he didn’t want to drink at all anymore. And expected me to do the same, on my birthday. 
- Wouldn’t allow me to drink red bull, would shame me when I’d eat ice cream or have soda on occasion (again I am a healthy weight).
- I was diagnosed with ADHD, he told me that “it takes months of appointments to get diagnosed with that” and my diagnosis wasn’t real. He told me he didn’t want me to take my antidepressant my psychiatrist prescribed. He sat me down, wrote a list of things he wanted me to do first (go to the gym every day, cut out caffeine, etc). So I dropped it. I started going to the gym for him and mind you, the gym was a 30 minute drive one way! 

Now here are the pros. And the things I’m ashamed to admit I miss.

- We did everything together. He was happy being at home with me and spending time with me doing nothing 
- He didn’t have a lock on his phone 
- He was very blessed in the 🍆 department. However, he was having issues on and off keeping it up. Maybe 2-3 times a month? And he would get frustrated and upset during intimacy when this happened. I never made him feel bad about this but it did alarm me. 
- He was fun to be around when he was in a good mood. 
- He would sometimes clean my car just to be nice. He did enjoy detailing so it made me happy he would think to do that for me
- He bought an additional Xbox so we could play video games together. Obviously this was his, but it was sweet he did that. But when we’d argue I wouldn’t be allowed to use it 
- He is a small business owner. Although he didn’t treat employees the best and ran through like 20 last year (he currently has 1 employee with 4 total trucks. He is an owner operator so he drives as well), he works hard and cared about his business. I wouldn’t have had to worry about him finding work 
- He always included me in the things he was invited to, even if we didn’t go he would invite me with him
- He was affectionate at home. Not so much verbally, but he would hug and kiss me every morning and night
- Would post me on FB, make sweet posts. But he did not say those things to my face 
- 100% faithful besides the 🌽 . I was willing to look past it…he said he was going to try to stop on his own bc it was giving him mental issues.  So that made me have a lot of faith in him 

I’m just having a really hard time. Even with the long list of cons, those pros man. I truly loved him and I felt safe. He left me at my lowest. I filed bankruptcy (I had credit card debt and I didn’t want him to take on that burden when we got married, so I did it to have a clean slate). I surrendered my car bc he said he was going to buy a family car for me to use, since he “didn’t want his future kids in my car”. I made so many sacrifices because I trusted him. 

He promised he wouldn’t leave me and would always try to make things work together. But then the situation with the ring, us arguing about venues…it just all fell apart. I feel like the biggest loser ever and i have no purpose anymore. I’ve lost most of my friends because of him telling everyone. Two of my friends have boyfriends who are his friends and it feels like I’ve been alienated. I’m back home with my parents and I feel like the most useless person ever. I am enrolling in school again and trying to get my life back on track. But I’m still so depressed and hopeless. I feel like I’ll never find anyone “good” again.

The below information is provided by UnitedWeDream.(Disclaimer: I am merely a student on campus and the information posted here does not equate to legal advice, I am not a lawyer or otherwise a professional in law or immigration)

# If Immigration Agents Approach you in Public-

# Prepare Yourself

* Fill out your preparedness plan and put it in a folder labeled “Privilege & Confidential” and give it to a person you trust.
* Create a plan in advance with your family and friends. Assign who will be in charge of your case and who will support at different capacities.
* Make sure your photos and videos are being synced to the cloud (e.g. iCloud or Google photos) in case you record an interaction with ICE so that other people can access it.
* Join a local pro immigrant rights group.
* Don’t carry a passport. A passport is a travel document and if you have it on you while detained, it can help ICE deport you faster.
* Don’t provide a foreign ID, this includes your consulate card, foreign driver’s license, foreign voting card, etc. A foreign ID reveals to the ICE agent that you were born in another country that is not the U.S.

# Defend Yourself

* Ask them to identify themselves.
* Provide your name only.
* Remain silent – if you choose to speak, remember to not lie.
* Ask for a warrant and check to see if your name is on it and spelled correctly.
* Record and report the incident.
* Stay calm and don’t run.
* Don’t share your personal or loved one’s information (name, address, etc).
* Don’t take ICE to your house to pick up your ID.
* Do not sign anything. Do not consent to being searched.
* ICE Lies: Do not agree to what ICE asks. For example, do not follow them to their office, to immigration offices like USCIS, or to meet them for coffee.

While asserting your rights does not guarantee the stop of an arrest at the moment, it is important to exercise our rights to facilitate our defense. You are not alone.

1isilhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1isilhn/revised_the_end_for_now/,revised: The End (for now),"In a distant future, above a small cafe, in the streets of a small mountain town, there is an apartment. The air smells of paint, ink, and roasted beans. Danielle stretches, as the gentle sun caresses her face. She rolls over to the window and watches the people below, going about their day: there are children climbing snow piles, pedestrians losing balance on the icy sidewalk, lovers brushing shoulders as they giggle and whisper to each other, greetings are shared by passers-by. 

Everyone knows everyone in this little town. There is full transparency amongst the residents. Your past and future simply do not exist here; there is only the now. At first it was hard to gain trust. There were not a lot of newcomers in this town and she was very careful with sharing her past. But over time, with patience and consistency, as well as the start of her writing career, she has built a reputation here. As her writing gained recognition, people began to piece together parts of her past and seemed to respect her for her perseverance and courage. Most people know how she ended up here, her past is respected and rarely spoken about. Every now and then, someone asks about the person she used to be after reading one of her books, but she doesn’t mind—it’s a consequence of honesty she has learned to accept. Curiosity came with kindness, rather than judgement. She once feared being seen through the lens of her mistakes, but enjoys helping people in similar situations. She was living proof that things get better—that change wasn’t just possible, but real. If her words could be the turning point for someone else, every question was worth it.

Her cafe is a safe space for a lot of people and a great place for a huge variety of quality coffee and baking. There is a small communal library by the fire pit, surrounded by worn-in couches. Her paintings and drawings cover the walls of the cafe, framed. She knows the name of everyone that walks in, and knows the order of each of them. She treats everyone with kindness. She comes off as bubbly but caring, and gentle but charismatic.

There was a time she was someone that wouldn’t be able to relate to the kind of person she was now. She never knew this kind of peace and contentment was achievable, especially for someone like her. She remembers a time when every silence was too loud, every stillness a threat. It used to feel as if everyone was out to get her. She was alone and holding on by a string. But here, in this little pocket of the world, surrounded by snowy giants, she built something steady, something safe, and kind. The cafe is hers. Every chipped saucer, every worn out page of different and unique recipes she created herself, even the beaten up oven that needs maintenance every week, were all a testament to her patience. She built this place, brick by brick, and no one would dare take that away.

The middle shelf of the communal library is filled with her poetry and short stories. There are a few published books but she prints out some of her rough drafts for review. A mug sits on top of the shelf, holding writing utensils for those that want to make corrections and give constructive criticisms on her drafts. She runs a book club and has made great acquaintances with the writers and artists of this town. They share and comment on each other’s works; positive reinforcements and suggestions are shared every sunday afternoon.

Her email inbox and her P.O. box are filled with letters and mail from strangers, thanking her for making them feel less alone with her writing. Sometimes there are foreign snacks, drawings of her fictional characters, stickers, pictures of the readers, or sometimes even short stories inspired by her own. She writes back with gratitude to each and every one, thanking them for spending the time to read her works, for their kind words, and their generosity. She prints out each email, and collects the physical ones mailed to her. She dates them and tucks them in with the rest in a box beneath her bed. The letter she wrote to herself years ago, from a place she barely remembers, with memories she still cherishes, rests at the very bottom of the box. She dares not read it when she is in a particular mood but she is grateful for the person that wrote it. It now exists as a reminder of a past self who would have never believed in this kind of fairy tale ending for herself.

—

It is just another Sunday afternoon. People gather by the fireplace, moving chairs and couches around to set up seats for the book club. We are no ordinary book club. Sometimes we are, but other times are dedicated for sharing our creations. There is a newcomer today. She is young but her eyes seem as though she’s lived through a war.

Today is poetry night. We give the newcomer a quick introduction. She had seen the flyer we had posted up on main street. She is on a solo vacation to escape her life. She started this journey to gain life experience and find inspiration for her writing.

We each take turns reading a new poem we had written. There is no judgement here. All forms are welcome. Most of them are free-form as none of us are focused on poetry as a medium. The topics vary, from morning routines, to a one night stand, stanzas written of a dream someone had or an awkward encounter from the other day. The newcomer is quiet but attentive. Soon enough it is the her turn. Nervous, she starts with a tremble in her voice:

“This one is called ‘go get her’.”

With every line her voice gets steadier. You can tell this poem represents her as a whole. It paints a picture of a girl, insecure, dissatisfied with her life and her place in it. She stares into the abyss and captures the pain with lines fed generously to rage. She paints a portrait of a girl I recognize. 

The girl that I pictured, would’ve found her poem to be grossly dramatic and a little arrogant. My past self would’ve been annoyed that she was wallowing in her own despair. She would’ve looked down upon her and made a condescending comment. But, she has changed. She is moved by every word as it tugs on her heart strings. She realizes how far she has come, not in a way that belittles the newcomer but with empathy. There was a time she would’ve written those exact words. She realizes she is no longer alone. She is no longer hopeless or afraid.

“It’s unclear whether or not she’s even here. All she wants is to disappear,” she finishes and looks up cautiously to the group. There is applause and comments on how touching it was. I don’t feel as though anyone has praised her enough. The gathering continues into the night, and soon each person makes their way out. 

The newcomer looks through the shelf of books and picks up my book of poetry. She reads through them with great concentration. Soon, there is only the two of us and I make my way over and sit on the couch next to her. As she flips the page, I say quietly:

“I wrote that, you know?”

She turns to me in shock. She looks at me and then down at the book. When she looks back up at me I tell her,

“You can have that copy if you want. I have a feeling you would have more use for it than I do.”

“No, I couldn’t. This is for the cafe isnt it?” she responds, hesitantly.

“Well, I own this cafe and I have multiple copies sitting just upstairs,” I say with a smile. “You remind me of when I was younger. Before I was a published author.”

“Really? Do you think I could someday publish a book of poems of my own?” she asks, excitedly.

“Of course. Here, let me show you something I wrote when I was around your age.” I say as I make my way upstairs. 

Once upstairs, I pull out the box of letters and pull out the letter I had written to myself, long ago. With the letter in one hand, I grab a fresh copy of the book she was reading and make my way back downstairs. I skim through the letter and start to feel emotional, as a sense of pride and relief takes over. I’ve come a long way.

“This is a letter I wrote to myself when I was just as confused and afraid as you probably are now,” I hesitantly hand over the letter. She takes it gently and starts to read.

As she is reading, I take a pen and open up the book. I write a message for her, one of hope and encouragement, followed by a signature. I hand her the book as she hands me the letter back, teary eyed.

“That was beautiful. It really captures an internal conflict that I can definitely relate to,” she says as she looks away, trying to hide her tears.

I notice she had brought a huge bag with her:

“Do you have a place to stay tonight?” I ask her, concerned.

“Well, not really. I was going to start hitchhiking down south once this meeting was over…” she trails off as she notices how dark it is outside.

“If you’d like, you can sleep on the couch upstairs in my apartment for the night and head out in the morning?” I ask, hoping she would accept.

“That is too kind of you. I have nothing to offer…” she looks down in shame.

“You don’t owe me anything. Think of this as a token of kindness for sharing your poem and contributing to my little club tonight. It was very courageous of you to open up to us. I resonated with your words and I want to thank you for taking me back to my past for a moment.” I say to her with a smile. “Follow me, let me show you my apartment. I hope you’re not allergic to cats!” I say enthusiastically as I make my way up again. She follows quietly.

We walk around the apartment and she pets the cats, her face bright.

You can put your stuff here and sleep on this couch. I’ll bring out some blankets and pillows for you.” I notice her admiring my art supplies and antique typewriter. “Feel free to use any of my art supplies or try typing on the typewriter. I’m a heavy sleeper so don’t worry about me.”

“I don’t even know how to thank you, wow. This is my dream set-up. You are so cool,” her eyes sparkle as she looks up at me from the couch.

I chuckle, “Well, make yourself at home. I’m going to go clean up downstairs quickly and I’ll be right back!”

—

The next morning, I find her in the middle of painting me asleep:

“I’m sorry, that’s probably a little creepy, huh? You just looked so pretty and comfy.”

“Don’t even apologize. It looks amazing,” I reassure her with a smile. “So, you heading out soon?”

“I guess I should be making my way out. I don’t want to be intruding in your space,” she responds in disappointment

“You don’t have to leave, you know? You can stay here as long as you please. I could use some company and some help at the cafe?” I look at her in hopes she will stay.

“If you don’t mind, I would love to stay a little longer. I will help out downstairs for sure.” she responds cautiously.

“Then we have a deal. I have extra toothbrushes in the medicine cabinet. Come downstairs when you’re ready and we’ll open up shop for the day!” I say to her with excitement.

—

It’s been a year since Sophie stumbled her way into my life.

“I need a double shot latte with a teaspoon of brown sugar for Leslie,” I say to her as I ring the customer in.

“Comin up boss!” 

Sophie has been a huge help around here. Not only is she efficient, her customer service is excellent and she keeps the place tidy. She is an amazing roommate and an even better companion. She is extremely caring and kind, and full of amazing ideas. She is a talented artist and her creations never fail to exceed my expectations.

She had stayed with me for a week before venturing south a year ago, but she soon realized there was nothing for her out there. She knew where she really wanted to be. She knew where she belonged. She returned home and packed her things, discreetly,  to stay with me indefinitely. Her parents would never approve, but then again her parents never approved of anything. She had technically run away from home when she first met her. They were loving but  strict. Sophie was not allowed any autonomy. Her feelings were invalidated and her dreams were crushed. There was no future for her back home. They didn’t believe in art or mental health and it had felt like a prison, rather than a home.

I cleared out the extra room I had that I had used for storage to make a room for Sophie. Having a roommate has given me an opportunity to travel, as she looks after the cafe and the cats. She was the piece I was missing for my happy ending.

Most nights we stay up drinking tea on my bed, sharing stories from our lives. She is like a sister I never had and a person I love more than even myself. Although she is younger than me, I look up to her. Over the months of her staying here, she has definitely brightened up. She writes now, of her hopes and dreams. She writes of finding peace, and coming to terms with her identity. 

She thanks me every once in a while for providing her a safe space to heal and grow. She tells me that I saved her life. I don’t think I deserve that compliment but I accept it nonetheless. She doesn’t know that, as much as I helped her heal, she has helped me the same, if not more. I cherish our friendship and I love her more than anything.

—

Love is no longer something she has to earn, chase, or reshape herself to receive. It exists, simply because she exists. She no longer chases external  validation. This love doesn't hurt her or scare her. She is not scared or disappointed by her flaws or her past, and there are no expectations.  She simply hears her every word, and sees and accepts her every paint stroke, every scar on her body. She is heard and seen. She is loved.

The cafe opens late today, so they decide to go for breakfast together. A new place had opened where the old library once was. Sophie goes to her room to change as Danielle  goes to the bathroom to freshen up.

Her hair is a mess, and her eyes are crusty but her face is bright. She’s glowing. Vulnerable in safe hands. Once upon a time, it was painful to look in the mirror, it was a reminder of everything she hated. When she looked at her reflection she saw a coward and a mess. The reflection was always distorted, repulsive. She saw a girl, desperate for love but not deserving of any, the girl made mistakes and caused pain to those that did not deserve it. She didn’t think she would ever be forgiven, she didn’t believe she was redeemable.

 She had wished for this kind of life. She had hoped I would be seen and embraced for who she was. The issue was, she wanted that from someone else. All along, the approval she really needed was from herself.

Danielle looks at her reflection. “I see you,” she thinks to herself. “I see you as you are. You look beautiful.”

1isil6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/leblanccabo/comments/1isil6z/resort_review/,Resort Review,"As a Palace Resorts member, I’ve stayed at a few of their properties, but Le Blanc Los Cabos has my heart. I’ve been lucky enough to visit twice, once for a romantic week-long getaway with my partner and another time for a mother-daughter weekend, and both trips were absolutely incredible in their own unique ways.

The first time, my partner and I stayed for a full week, and wow, Le Blanc really knows how to set the mood for romance. From the second we walked in, everything felt luxurious but not stuffy. We spent our days lounging by the infinity pools with drinks in hand (the poolside service is on point) and our evenings having amazing dinners. Lumière was definitely our favorite with its multi-course tasting menu. Plus, our butler hooked us up with bubble baths and even unpacked for us (we were spoiled, I won’t lie). The couples massage at Blanc Spa was next level, probably the best we’ve ever had. Overall, it was just pure relaxation and romance all week.

The second time, I went back for a weekend with my mom, and it was just as magical, but in a totally different way. We had an oceanfront room and spent our mornings on the balcony, sipping coffee and watching whales breach, literally from our room! Such a cool experience. We did yoga together, hit the hydrotherapy circuit at the spa (which is included, btw—don’t skip it!), and just enjoyed some serious bonding time. At night, we had a delicious dinner at Bella with homemade pasta and wine while watching the sunset. It felt like such a special trip, and my mom is still talking about it.

As a Palace Resorts member, I felt super taken care of both times. They gave us priority for dinner reservations and kept our room stocked with top-shelf drinks. The staff even remembered me from my first visit, which was such a nice touch.

Whether you’re going for a romantic escape or a family trip (minus the kids), Le Blanc Los Cabos is pure perfection. It’s peaceful, gorgeous, and the service is truly next level. I already can’t wait for my next visit!

The last year of our relationship was filled with uncertainty and lack of excitement/intimacy which we both took responsibility for. After an incident, she made the decision to break up with me and we both moved out of our apartment together.  We have been apart 8 months now but not without interaction and bread crumbing along the way. I will do my best to articulate everything which is what I am struggling with the most.                              1. For the msot part we had a really strong relationship, filled with adventure, love similar hobbies and good conversation.  We went to 20+ of our best friends weddings and shared incredible experiences.  We had similar goals in life and were raised from rather similar socioeconomic families.  One thing I will say is that this woman mentioned to me she grew up in a household where love wasn't necessarily verbalized often but that she ""knew they cared"".  I say this because I believe this person to be an extreme avoidant in the situation. 2. She broke up with me 8 months ago and we would occasionally see each other but for the most part I kept my distance.  It is hard to do this because we live within a mile in the same city, she works by where I live, we go to the same athletic club and we have so many of the same friends.  During the time apart, she started reaching out a bit towards the 5/6 month mark.  Texting me over holiday break that she had been thinking about me.  We decided to go for coffee one day and kept it causal and cool. We then decided on going to dinner and ten another dinner and then another dinner. During the 3rd dinner, she was asking questions like ""Are you seeing anyone who would be upset you're with your ex?"" and then proceeded to tell me she wasn;t either (unprompted).  She said, ""I thought I would eventually get over you and it just hasn;t happened"" ""I would love to keep doing this with you and appreciate you taking it slowly."" That last evening I walked her home and she initiated a goodbye make out with me. Fast forward two weeks and it seems she had been getting a bit more distant in texts/communication. The next time we saw each other out I brought it up and was faced with the response, ""I am not ready to get back into any sort of relationship with you and am unsure why you thought that was going to be the end result of this."" You can undestand why I was so shocked and hurt by this but ultimately I said okay and walked away.  I ended up reaching out the next day via phone and we talked a bit and she seemed to have the same mindset and said she doesn't think she is in love with me....right now."" I went into no contact, took a solo trip by myself and have continued to work but I think about her every single day.  I can't understand someone who would do all those things and then rip out the rug. It's been a month of no contact and I recently heard someone flew her out to another area to go on a date after they had been talking a bit online.  I write all this to try and understand. I feel there were issues with each of us individually but the relationship itself was great.

I called in to customer service and get the runaround.  The only thing that happens is they retroactively go back in and make a change to the shipping status (I took a screenshot before calling them). Now 3 days later there is no progress. 

Items I ordered several days later have arrived. 

When I called back in do you think they would admit the item is lost?  No it’s call back in 4 more days and if there still is no progress maybe we’ll refund your purchase. 

“Luckily” Amazon has said they will refund tomorrow.

Meta has made a huge downgrade with Q3 but most of us don't know about it.","Grab a coffee and get ready to read this long post,



TLDR: There is a thing I found out about yesterday, it's called binocular overlap, and it's the reason why Q3 isn't impressive for some people. Q3 binocular overlap is very low. binocular overlap is one of the key points to get immersed in VR. 

\--  
The long version:  
  
What is binocular overlap?  
The area seen by both eyes simultaneously, allowing for depth perception. A larger overlap improves 3D vision, while a smaller one reduces depth cues  
  
How to simulate low binocular overlap?  
In normal life, your brain takes the data from your eyes with little processing, but once there is a blackspot, your brain will try to fill the gap, you won't see a black spot, but the image won't be real. your perception will change, you will know something is wrong, but you just can't point your finger at the problem.  
  
How to simulate low binocular overlap? Try placing your hand vertically in front of your nose, perpendicular to your face, to separate both of your eyes. You can still see the world in front of you, but now your brain is struggling to merge both images from your eyes, causing eye strain, a loss of depth, and a diminished sense of reality.

\--

For the past few months, I noticed I'm not getting impressed in VR, instead of being inside the scene, it feels like I'm just looking at the scene in stereoscopic 3d, the depth is there but it just can't trick my mind that I'm actually there inside the vr scene. 

So here the story begins:  
Yesterday I thought I should check my old Oculus Go and see if it's still working, I had the Jurassic World demo installed, and when I played it, my mind was blown away, I was inside the scene again, it was so easy for me to look around, my eyes were so comfortable even with lower FOV, but that low FOV didn't distract me from being inside the scene unlike Q3. it was so easy to look at near objects too (less than 2 meter/6 feet). with Q3 I try to squint to look at near objects which gives me eye strain. 

I thought wait a minute, this can't be right, this device has no IPD at all, how can this be true? maybe my mind is just playing tricks on me? so I went back to my Q3 and installed the same demo, and repeated the test with my Q3, and yep, I can't trick my mind to be inside the scene. 

I have a low IPD 60°, I tried putting Q3 to a higher or lower IPD, but that didn't help. with lower I get better depth but my eyes hurt, I just couldn't get the same feeling as Oculus Go.

So after this test, I googled and found multiple posts mentioning the issue, I was losing my mind and I thought It's just me, but looks like this is a big issue that affects some people not all, but most doesn't even realize it, I'm a game dev since 2017, I never knew about this issue, I just thought my mind got used to VR, and I'm not going to get the same old days again when I jump scare from a small scene inside VR, for some people it's a major issue and they even see a black line between two eyes, and others like me it's a minor issue they lose the impressive of being inside the VR scene.

Now I'm a bit sad and happy, I know the problem isn't in my eyes anymore (partially), and there are headsets that could fix this issue I'm having (maybe Q3s)? I don't own that headset yet, but at the same time, I'm really sad since Q3 lens is so awesome and clear, it's a superb headset. there is nothing like it in the market.  


My research didn't stop here, I went back and brought some of my headsets from the closet. I wanted to see when did Meta messed up without us realizing it?   
  
I found out that Q2 has a better binocular overlap, unlike Q3.   
I went back to Q1, and this headset still has better binocular overlap than Q3.   
But none had the same feeling as Oculus Go, How can this be right?  
  
Then I thought I should check my Pico 4 ultra, and wow, this headset was the only one that gave me the same feeling as Oculus Go, I'm inside the VR scene again, and my mind believes what I see. but this headset isn't perfect, the air flows inside the champer, which gives you a really bad dry eye.  


So now what? we can't fix this issue, it's a hardware flaw, people need to raise this issue to the Meta team so we can get it fixed with their next headset, binocular overlap value got worse with each headset. and VR reviews on youtube need to raise this issue too. there is no point looking at 4K clear image if you are not feeling it.   


Going to rank the best headset I've tried that makes you feel inside the VR scene to the worset:  
1- Oculus Go (couldn't find it, but I'm sure its high > 100).  
2- Pico 4 [104.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/PICO4_Native_R90_top.dmx.png) (going to assume it's the same for Pico 4 Ultra).  


  
3- Q1 [84.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/Quest_Native_R72_top.dmx.png) (not sure why this value is low here, I'm going to assume its not accurate. or some other reasons)  
  
As for the below headsets, the head has the worst feeling of being immersed.   
4- Q2 [90.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/Quest2_Native_R72_top.dmx.png)  
5- Q3 [80.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/MetaQuest3_Native_R72_top.dmx.png)   
  
I'm just hoping Meta will release a headset with a pancake lens and a higher binocular overlap. 

Some will say Meta had to sacrifice binocular overlap to get a bigger FOV, but that's not true at all, Pico has [122.16°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/PICO4_Native_R90_over.dmx.png) FOV and a great [104.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/PICO4_Native_R90_top.dmx.png) binocular overlap. so this is something we can get if we ask for.   


If you never had an issue with this, then good for you, this is for people who are having issue with, some get eye strain after a few hours without realizing why? then this is probably one of the the reasons, I had to put eye drops every single time I use VR. but not anymore.  
Or probably you never owned a headset with a higher binocular overlap, so you have no idea what you are missing.   


My advice here for people who get eye strain, or feel the VR isn't impressed, get Q3s instead of Q3, at least that one has a similar binocular overlap to Q2.   
Other related posts: [1](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/Binocular-Overlap-Quest-3/m-p/1294592/highlight/true#M356712) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/177seyr/tips_on_how_to_reduce_binocular_overlap/)   
  
If I had to guess, How does it look like inside the headets?  with Oculus Go you are looking through a square window from your room,  
As for and Pico, you are looking through a circular window from your room,  
As for Q2 and Q3, it feels different, like looking through a binoculars.

A little background:
Me (24m) and my ex (23f) started dating in high school, and were together for a little over 4 years.

We had a good relationship. It started badky but grew and improved with time.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just before we started dating, which affected the relationship at times.

Towards the end of the relationship i was in a very bad place mentally, and felt the relationship was causing me distress rather than helping due to a few factors, so i decided to break up with her because I felt i needed to get better and work on myself alone.

We went no contact, but ofc we broke it a few times. About 5 months after the break up we started talking again and we kinda unofficial for 2 months before she said it was too early and too hard for her, and cut contact once again. 

After that, I spent a lot of time and effort to better myself physically and mentally. I (and my family and friends) feel i have improved significantly, and I feel I know more how to navigate my feelings  and that i know how i want a relationship to look like.

During this time i did try to date, but wasn't too into it. I did ask her at one stage if she wanted to meet up for coffee, which she initially agreed, but later said she wasn'tup for it, which I respected. I then decided to completely delete anything related to her i could find, and that I'm completely over her.

About two months ago I met someone. And for the first time I felt in love, which enforced my thoughts that i am over my ex. Unfortunately it didn't work out with her but it's whatever. Just that it made me believe that i truly am ready to love someone else.

I just got back from a trip overseas where i did a lot of self reflection, and my ex came to mind. Just thinking about how things would be now and how I'd react to seeing her and all that. And i have noticed that i can't really stop thinking about her, wanting to talk snd see her.

I guess I am just not sure if these thoughts and feelings are some hyper fixation or are these feeling real and i should reach out again.

Ive cleaned things like hotels, closing shifts at restaurants and coffee shops, deep cleaned my own home and my families homes. I would consider myself moderately experienced in cleaning definitely not an expert. I posted i was looking for work in my home town, i get someone thats interested its an older man, his daughter reached out says they have a mouse issue and are having exterminator come out to get rid of them, i go okay ill come look and see what id charge to clean the house up. I go look take some photos, i should have REALLY LOOKED at this place before even considering as i just kind of popped in and out. This place was SO bad i underquoted severely. Me and my husband ended up working 5 hrs removing five contractor bags of food and garbage. I found 20+ live mice in the pantry. I pushed through although i considered leaving many times, i finished all of it but the floor im talking i scrubbed everything, cabinets, oven, sink, bathroom, fridge. My husband cleaned the cobwebs, i mean the guy was basically living in spider valley, like HUGE spiders everywhere thankfully my husband has no issues with bugs. He is disabled so he had urinal jugs all over i did not touch them, and there was feces on the side of the toilet. Honestly the house is completely hazardous. We should have worn suits but we had gloves glasses and masks on. I asked the gentleman for $400 (thats half down) before i started. Three days later and I honestly cant get it out of my mind i still feel disgusting.. i have to wait to deposit this check to see if it clears before i go finish this job but i don’t think i can do it. I don’t think i can go back into this house it’s so bad. I got myself wayyyy in over my head with this one.. Any advice? ",1,1739899751.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False
1isi61e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1isi61e/thinking_about_putting_in_offer_on_my_first_home/,Thinking about putting in offer on my first home but am unsure. need some advice,"Me and my husband went to view a 3 bed, 2 bath victorian terraced house, with a loft conversion. We feel like it's the perfect house for us but just in the wrong location and overpriced because of it. 

It's in the Tuebrook area in Liverpool and just off a busy main road. The seller is asking for £190. In that same area, a few other 3 bed houses are going from £125 to £160, there is only one other 4 bed house asking for £180. 

The house is very well maintained, with modern decor, a new kitchen that will come with cooker, new boiler and lots of built in storage space. It has double glazed windows and a wood burning heater in the living room which I've heard is for saving energy and also helps with getting rid of moisture in the house. 

There are a few downsides, we've noticed that upstairs, the sockets were located in the skirting boards which would indicate old wiring and with it being a victorian house there's only on-street parking, which was pretty full the day we visited, and a small back yard, granted it has an outhouse with washing machine fitted. But the biggest downside for us is still the location.

We currently rent an apartment in the city center, which is great because we are within walking distance to our favorite grocery shops, my husbands work, gp practice 5 min walk, the cinema that we go to about once a week and coffee shops, etc. I have great transport links out of town to my work, but I only go there twice a month, and husband only goes into the office 3 times a week. 

If we bought this property, that would put me at 1h30 commute from my work and my husband at 30min to his. He currently has mobility issues due to some health problems, so I would most likely have to get a car to take him into town for work and also to do the weekly grocery shopping.

We were thinking of putting in an offer of £160, but I fear it may be too low for what the owner is asking. The owner was the one who showed us the house, he really took pride in it and all the renovations he had done. He was showing the house on the same day to 6 other people, it has been two days and the house is still up, doesn't say it's under offer. I definitely feel it's overpriced but I fear we will regret it if the house goes and we didn't put in an offer. 

I'm wondering if you guys think £160 would be an insult or if it's a fair price? This would be the first time we would put in an offer for a house, and I'm just second-guessing myself.",1,1739899661.0,HousingUK,1,1.0,False

I've reset my personal router, which is wired to AT&T's router.","TL;DR My home wifi setup is uncommon. What settings do I investigate to unblock Keycloak? Everything else I do on the internet works fine, and other users at my company use Keycloak fine.

Setup 1: AT&T fiber internet -> AT&T router -> AT&T wifi extender -> Development laptop  
Setup 2: AT&T fiber internet -> AT&T router -> 150' ethernet cable -> Asus RT-AC68U router -> Development laptop  
  
Context:  
  
I'm an application developer within the company I work for, who has configured Keycloak to secure our cloud software (Jira, Gitlab, etc).  
  
I was able to authenticate through Keycloak on this laptop with no issues at my previous residence, using Xfinity's fiber router.  
  
My new residence is one of two units on the property, where the landlord shares one internet connection between the units. They're 100' apart, so he ran a hardwired ethernet cable and terminated it into an Asus wifi router. In addition, the other unit has an AT&T wifi extender (connected to its AT&T router). The ethernet wire is connected to the AT&T router in 1 of the 4 ports.

I've factory reset the Asus router and the issue still exists. Upon connecting to the freshly-reset router, a window popped up (similar to hotel / coffee shop wifi login screens) with the message:  
  
You failed to access the web page that you want to view.  
\- Reason for failed connection: IP conflict detected  
\- We suggest you: (Need account and password of administrator.)  
\- Click next to have the router automatically get a new IP address. The new IP address is: [192.168.2.1](http://192.168.2.1)  
\- Please ensure that you configure each services, such as Port Forwarding or DMZ, to use the new IP address

Upon clicking Next, a loading bar appeared with the message ""Changing the local subnet...""  
\- The IP address is being renewed.   
\- If this process takes more than two minutes, please follow these three steps to renew the IP manually: - (1) unplug the network cable; (2) wait for about 10 seconds; and (3) plug it back again to get a new IP address.  
  
When I try to load our Jira / Gitlab / etc, I'm redirected to a Keycloak-prefixed url, asking me to sign in.  
  
I chose the only authentication method available to me, which attempts to redirect to another Keycloak-prefixed url.  
  
Unfortunately, the request times out and Chrome displays:  
This site can’t be reached. <server FQDN>’s server IP address could not be found.  
  
The Developer Tool's network tab shows the request status as:  
(failed) net::ERR\_NAME\_NOT\_RESOLVED

I can definitely get the tenants of the other unit to factory-reset the AT&T router if needed. To their knowledge, though, only the password has been changed.

I had requested that they repair the shower which had a leaky head in June of 2024. After several visits by a few plumbing contractors it was revealed the issue was with some valves in the wall rather than the head.

A plumber came out to resolve the issue on October 3rd and in the course of the repair destroyed the glass panel the shower fittings were affixed to, thereby rendering the shower useless and leaving dry wall with mold all over it exposed in the en suite. I have been trying to get this resolved and due to issues with the maintenance team turn over and the owner arguing with the plumbing company on who was responsible still have a useless shower. I have other showers in the flat so I think they don't view not having use of my main en suite as a cause for concern. What recourse do I have to the letting agency still having no estimate for when this can be repaired and when I will have the full use of my rental?

Repairs at this flat have been a constant issue, and most requested items have just been decided to not repair by the owner, like a built in coffee machine, a wine fridge, etc. I am paying over 4k/month for this nonsense.

1ishy72,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1ishy72/a_small_guide_for_longer_responses_and_more/,A small guide for longer responses and more interesting chats!,"I’ve noticed that a lot of the complaints on this subreddit seem to come from people under the age of 18. While, sure, some issues are definitely the app’s fault, a lot of them actually come down to how users interact with it.

So, I’ve put together a little guide on how I personally get better responses! Hopefully, it'll help some of you out.

1. Avoid using OOC (Out of Character)

We’ve all seen those posts where people put things in parentheses or use OOC phrases. I get it, sometimes it’s tempting to throw in an aside, but here’s the thing: everything you say to the bot trains it in some way (or so I’ve been told). If you put something in parentheses, the bot tends respond —often in OOC, too. If you tell the bot to go back and remember something, it's not really going to do it, that's not how it works. I’ll admit, I occasionally ask how old the bot is meant to be in OOC, but I always edit my message after I get the answer to avoid messing with the bot’s responses other.

2. Make your first message count!

One thing I've noticed over my time of using [C.AI](http://C.AI) (I’ve been around since the early days), is that a lot of complaints are about receiving short responses. If you want long replies, you need to make your first message longer than two sentences. If the bot's intro is just “I am \[blank\],” the bot isn’t going to magically come up with deep replies further into the story. You're not off the hook either,  your writing needs to be long as well. A little effort goes a long way. Even a few extra details, like “She had long pink hair, typically pinned back out of her face,” can make a difference.

3. Describe, describe, describe!

How is the bot supposed to know what your character looks like if you don’t describe them properly? If you’re using the persona feature, and it works, great, but I find it’s unreliable as you move forward in your story. So, instead of running to the subreddit to complain, just keep adding those details into your roleplay as you continue. If your character has pink hair, keep mentioning it as you go along! Don't let it slip, even if the bot doesn’t seem to remember it at first.

4. Keep the messages flowing

So, you want your story to be longer? You can’t just slack off after the first message. Keep the pace going with long replies. If you feel like you’re running out of things to say, you can always repeat part of what the bot said or describe the environment. For example, “He glanced away, looking at the reds and oranges of the setting sun, before returning his gaze to \[blank\].” Simple, but it adds length and depth.

5. Try third-person writing

Speaking from experience, using third-person for both your character and the bot makes everything clearer. I used to write in the first person, referring to my character as ""I"" and the bot as ""you,"" but that got confusing fast. Using your character’s name in sentences can really help. For example, instead of saying “I looked at you,” say “\[Character’s name\] looked over to \[blank\], watching as \[blank\] washed the dishes.” It keeps things straight, especially when both characters are the same gender or if one of them uses they/them pronouns.

6. Some examples

Here’s a little comparison of my messages with a bot’s responses.

Longer messages:

\-Bot's starting message: 337 words, 2,013 characters.

\-My starting message: 219 words, 1189 characters. (On the low side for me)

\-Bot's response: 99 words, 569 characters (The message cut off, I believe there's a 570-ish character limit for the bots...)

\-My response: 139 words, 715 characters

\-Bot's response: 90 words, 530 characters

\-My response: 144 words, 792 characters

\-Bot's response: 97 words, 546 characters

Shorter messages:

\-Bot's starting message: 337 words, 2,013 characters.

\-My starting message: 19 words, 109 characters

\-Bot's response: 65 words, 353 characters

\-My response: 22 words, 110 characters

\-Bot's response: 51 words, 308 characters

\-My response: 14 words, 76 characters

\-Bot's response: 46 words, 247 characters

Notice the pattern? When my responses are shorter, the bot’s responses follow suit.

(Here's the word meow 50 times with 249 characters for reference: meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow)

7. Keep the story moving

Messages are like a conversation. Don’t get stuck in repetitive actions like “I continue walking.” That’s not adding anything to your story. If the bot’s not doing anything interesting, describe something in your surroundings. Point out a flower, mention a dog you walk past, or maybe stop at a cafe for coffee. There are tons of things to do—get creative!

And don’t be afraid to drive the action forward! You can even start a crazy storyline if things are getting too dull. Why not start an apocalypse? Remember, the bot is following and reacting to what YOU do.

That’s all for now!

I've been eyeing up Porsche Caymans/Caymen? and Maserati Gran Turismos while fabulous they'd be financially ruinous but Porsche and Italian V8. 

I'm trying to decide as the values on non Performance DS3s have fallen out of the ass and I would have lost £6K since I bought it and I've only put 30k miles on it which stings, and stings even more as I've just spent the £650 on getting it fixed. keeping it means I don't have to face that depreciation but will need to do more work as it'll need a service, MOT, tyres, alignment, a small oil leak fixing, and water pump pulley doing soonish but all that would cost the same as a service on a Porsche or Maserati.  

I want to keep it as it could be a fun little cheap to run ""GT"" that I could take to France, Germany and Italy and for coffee runs and being Euro6 it's exempt from a lot of the ULEZ zones also 30-45MPG while having fun is hard to ignore. 

Taking it for the drive this afternoon has made it harder as while it was covered in 3 months of winter crud I hated it but now it's clean and driving top down has reminded me of why I picked it in the first place.

My face is broken out with tons of pimples, and if you didn’t know me, I swear you would think I was trailer park trash the way I look. 

He eats out because of this job (they sometimes pay him back) but I’m stuck at home with whatever is here, which is usually just the items I get through wic. And once those run out, I’m eating rice to save the protein we do pay for, for dinner. That I have to cook every night. 

And now that baby is not a potato, I’m expected to keep the house clean. When he comes home he plays his video games to unwind and contributes nothing to the baby or the household. His last attempt at help when o asked, he basically shifted around the laundry and then when I called him out for it, deflected it back at me like I was asking too much. 

He will occasionally give our child a bath, but not because it’s the right thing to do, but because he wants to make sure his bond with the baby stays stronger than mine— he relishes in the fact that the baby sees him as fun time (because his interactions are scarce and the only time he interacts with him is to play, whereas I’m doing all the domestic labor). The fact that I have zero reward for my work other than the occasional “you’re killing it!” When I beg for some recognition, is also ruining my relationship with my son. I love him but i start getting mad that he loves his dad more than me despite me doing all this work for absolutely nothing— I can’t even order coffee! 

And when I ask for coffee beans it’s a “you don’t need it” from my husband. I still do it of course but now it feels like work. Like I’m a slave to both my husband and my son. The only thing I’m doing for myself is going to school— and I know that once I graduate and get a job, he’s going to be demanding I give him the money because it’s “our money” (even though I have to ask permission and beg just to get something as small as a coffee).

And he tells me to “wait” and that I should just believe that he will make enough to support us. I don’t think so. He’s a car guy. He makes too many jokes about buying expensive cars and playing like “oh the dealership just gave it away” when he tries to explain how they got in the garage (in other words, not talking about major purchases with “our money”) but when I say fine, I’ll just fill my closet with clothes (by the way, the closest is 98% his clothes. Not joking) or buy whatever I want, he makes a sour face because it’s just unacceptable for me to spend money the way I want when we have it b it it’s completely acceptable for him too.

Needed to get that off my chest. Because my feelings are making me feel like a terrible mom for beginning to hate taking care of my own son.  More often than not I’m throwing him in his crib and walking away.",34,1739898551.0,Mommit,147,0.76,False

Could this be a hyper fixation that i should let burn out or is it true love?","Hi all!
A little background:
Me (24m) and my ex (23f) started dating in high school, and were together for a little over 4 years.

We had a good relationship. It started badky but grew and improved with time.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just before we started dating, which affected the relationship at times.

Towards the end of the relationship i was in a very bad place mentally, and felt the relationship was causing me distress rather than helping due to a few factors, so i decided to break up with her because I felt i needed to get better and work on myself alone.

We went no contact, but ofc we broke it a few times. About 5 months after the break up we started talking again and we kinda unofficial for 2 months before she said it was too early and too hard for her, and cut contact once again. 

After that, I spent a lot of time and effort to better myself physically and mentally. I (and my family and friends) feel i have improved significantly, and I feel I know more how to navigate my feelings  and that i know how i want a relationship to look like.

During this time i did try to date, but wasn't too into it. I did ask her at one stage if she wanted to meet up for coffee, which she initially agreed, but later said she wasn'tup for it, which I respected. I then decided to completely delete anything related to her i could find, and that I'm completely over her.

About two months ago I met someone. And for the first time I felt in love, which enforced my thoughts that i am over my ex. Unfortunately it didn't work out with her but it's whatever. Just that it made me believe that i truly am ready to love someone else.

I just got back from a trip overseas where i did a lot of self reflection, and my ex came to mind. Just thinking about how things would be now and how I'd react to seeing her and all that. And i have noticed that i can't really stop thinking about her, wanting to talk snd see her.

I guess I am just not sure if these thoughts and feelings are some hyper fixation or are these feeling real and i should reach out again.

4. After sufficiently draining the liquor from the ingredients, add them to the 150ml of water and bring to a boil, simmer for 5-7 minutes, and turn off. Allow these herbs and spices to sit overnight to steep and cool.
5. Strain the tea/water into the sweetener.
6. Finally, add the strained alcohol and sugary tea together, and strain through a cheesecloth or coffee filter several times to remove all the fine bits.

I enjoy immersing myself in local culture, food/drink (coffee and wine), sometimes nature and architecture -- favoring authentic and less touristy areas, but also being open to visiting must-see/iconic areas that may be more touristy due to their allure. 

I know for instance that Gaudi's work dominate much of my first day in Barca, and while I'm not an architecture buff, I feel I will be able to appreciate the dedication and detail. Also, not so much into the partying scene.

1ishklt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ishklt/does_my_ex_gf_20f_really_want_to_be_friends/,does my ex gf (20f) really want to be friends?,"long story short my ex gf broke up with me around 4 weeks ago and about 2 weeks ago I asked her to block me bc I couldn’t stop trying to reconcile the relationship. I had been texting her even while blocked as a therapeutic way to just get out whatever it was I wanted to say to her, usually random questions or letting her know how my day had been. None of these went through of course. So, this morning I texted asking about a protein bar I wanted to try and if she’d tried it, and holy fuck it went through. 

Why she unblocked me I don’t know but that scared the fuck out of me. I went into panic and quickly unsent it and then sent an apology message for how I behaved prior to the blocking and asked if she’d still like to be friends, even if just online playing video games for now. I had planned to send this message in a few weeks but panic sent it now. I was asking to be friends bc the day we broke up she said that i was her best friend and she wanted things to remain that way, and I realize now just how ‘best’ of a friend she really was to me as well. 

She said yes she’d like to be friends but she doesn’t have her console at school so it’d have to be over the summer. 

I had hoped we could play games or phone call and eventually get to a point where we could meet for coffee and do some of the things we used to do together but as friends during this spring. I do miss her company.

She lives a few states away and is transferring closer to home in the fall so my chances to see her in person as friends are limited almost exclusively to the spring sadly, and I think I may have ruined the chances of that happening by trying to reconcile a few weeks ago.

It’s only been 4 weeks since the breakup but I’m not sure if things will improve, her texting this morning was very dry and emotionless, not really showing interest in the conversation whatsoever or sharing anything about how she has been doing even when I asked. Very closed off. We used to discuss our emotions on a daily basis, for her to not even say something as simple as ‘I’m doing well’ is so odd to me :/ But still saying that she definitely wanted to be friends, so I’m just confused.

I guess my question is do you think it’s a defense mechanism on her part (stoic for now until trust is rebuilt) or she is just saying she wants to be friends to be nice and really has no interest in talking with me further?",1,1739898256.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

To quantify speculation I’ve been using total non commercial positions / total open interest extracted from COT reports using to cot_reports Python library. 

I have fetched data from Wheat - Chicago Board of Trade COT reports but the reports only run from 1986-2013. From 2013 - Present they are differentiated between Wheat-SRW (Soft Red Winter) and Wheat-HRW (Hard Red Winter). 

Is anyone familiar with CBOT wheat futures and knows if SRW was the primary wheat contract before 2013? I can’t find anything definitive online and don’t trust ChatGPT for this.

1ishfkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ishfkp/super_long_taper_to_combat_crazy_withdrawals/,Super long taper to combat crazy withdrawals?,"**TLDR** \- My withdrawals are crazy (even on a super long taper), and I'm curious if anyone has advice or has had a similar experience. I plan to talk with my doctor about my case specifically, but I'm posting here in the hopes that people like me will find this post in the future and have some resources to help them.



**Quitting experience:** I've been trying to quit coffee on and off for a couple years now, and every time I've tried to quit my withdrawals are so extreme that it interferes with my ability to work and I have to get back on caffeine. The first time I tried to quit I tapered down by having 50% less coffee every day (20g, 10g, 5g, etc), but the withdrawals got bad so I had to get back on my full dosage. Then I tried tapering over the course of a few months, decreasing my dose by about 10% every week, and again had to get back on because withdrawals got bad (although not as bad as the quick taper). 

This most recent time, I tried switching to caffeine pills equal to my estimated full intake from coffee (200 mg). After a few days it felt like that was not as much caffeine as I was used to, so I bumped to 260 mg but still felt bad, which made me wonder if there are other compounds in the coffee that are causing these withdrawals? I've seen people mention stuff about MAOIs and other compounds in coffee that could be causing issues, but it seemed like (at best) there needs to be more research into the actual impacts of those compounds before I feel like I can confidently blame my issues on them.

**Withdrawal symptoms:** Extreme fatigue (needing hours of naps a day and still being tired), extreme anxiety/panic attacks, dizziness, brain fog, inability to focus on anything, memory difficulty, irritability. I usually feel GREAT the first day without no/less caffeine, but then starting the 2nd or 3rd day I start to feel really bad. 

In my past attempts, my withdrawals got so bad I was unable to do my job. 

**Caffeine intake**: One homemade pour over per day (20g of high quality beans, 320g of water at 200 deg F). I drink the first half of the cup an hour after I wake up and the other half \~4 hours later around 11:00 am (this helps me avoid a crash and get more sustained energy).

Given this amount and brew method, I'm assuming that I'm getting an average of about 200 mg of caffeine a day (probably give or take 50 mg depending on how strong a particular bag of coffee is). If this mg estimate seems way off to anyone, please let me know! On rare occasions (maybe 4 times a year) I'll have a second coffee and it always makes me feel way over-caffeinated and anxious.

**Other drugs I take**: Levothyroxine (for hypothyroid), Adderall (for ADHD and narcolepsy without cataplexy), propranolol (beta blocker for anxiety, as needed)

**Medical/personal context**: I'm 30 years old, male. I exercise regularly (climbing, running, dance, volleyball; almost every day). I eat pretty clean, I basically don't drink alcohol, I have less sugar than the average person. I'm really good about keeping my sleep schedule in order, and I get much higher quality sleep than most narcoleptics. I live at latitude 40° N, so its winter right now and I'm not getting as much sun as would be ideal (though where I live is sunny 200+ days a year), but between hobbies and walking the dog I do manage to get sun (including morning sun) most of the time. I live in a car dependent area and work a desk job, so outside of my hobbies/fitness regiment I'm fairly sedentary.

I have a hypothyroid condition, fairly mild narcolepsy (without cataplexy), ADHD, and maybe an autism spectrum situation (diagnosis in the works). I also struggle with anxiety/depression, which both fluctuate between being ""basically in remission"" to ""quite challenging, but livable under normal circumstances"".

My thyroid is managed very well on my medication, and my levels haven't fluctuated at all in over a decade on the medicine. My narcolepsy is pretty much a background concern so long as I'm sleeping well, exercising, etc. My ADHD is certainly a challenge for me, but under normal circumstances I'm able to function with a manageable level of discomfort.

**---**

  
I want to find a way to taper off without having crazy withdrawal symptoms. My narcolepsy and anxiety have been debilitating with the protocols I've followed before, but I still think quitting will be good for me in the long term. Caffeine makes me anxious, restless, unable to have steady/controlled focus, and makes me tired and sad when I crash. 

Does anyone have advice on pursuing a super long taper? I'm thinking about decreasing my 20g of coffee beans by a half gram a week (putting me at totally clean roughly 10 months from now). 

Thanks for reading my beast of a post. Let me know if y'all have any advice or thoughts on my situation. Hopefully someone out there finds it useful!

Godspeed, everyone!

1ishfeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ishfeh/how_do_people_deal_with_upset_stomach_from_anxiety/,How do people deal with upset stomach from anxiety.,"I’m 24, I’ve had anxiety since I gained consciousness and I could start remembering things. 

I remember starting kindergarten and my stomach would be in absolute knots in the morning. I’d feel like I’m either going to be sick, or have to use the bathroom. It was something every week, but my parents just assumed I was lying because I didn’t want to go. 

It never really stopped, I just stopped telling them about it. And it did change, it went from getting nauseous or getting sick to something else. 

The anxiety shits. 

Every goddamn morning before school, at school, at the worst possible time - the anxiety shits. 

How can I tell the difference between normal going to the bathroom and the anxiety being the cause? Urgency. The anxiety I’d be feeling at that moment. When you know, you know. 

I thought surely, this will end at some point. I’ll get used to it, and I won’t be stuck in the bathroom every time I experience some anxiety. Here I am, 24 years old, dealing with the same *anxiety shits* I got when I was in high school. All because I have to sign for a package my husband ordered. 

I swear, my anxiety goes straight to my stomach. I thought maybe if I stopped all caffeine consumption, I’d feel better. Maybe if I cut out some things in my diet, I’ll feel better. No. Instead I was anxious and miserable. No will to live without my morning Celsius water packet or coffee, and still just as anxious. I’m sure for some people, caffeine makes it worse. I have never noticed a difference. It doesn’t make it better if I cut it out, it doesn’t make it worse if I continue consuming it. 

I know I’m not the only one that has this happen. I’m trying to see a psychiatrist, soon, hopefully. I might get an appointment in at some point in my lifetime. 

Will anxiety medication help with this? Am I stuck with this problem, forever? Do I bring up this problem, specifically, or can I just describe the anxiety/answer their questions and have some sort of dignity without explaining I have the anxiety shits. I can anonymously admit I have the problem, but face to face? Just kill me instead. ",1,1739897932.0,Anxiety,4,0.67,False

1ishavj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/1ishavj/not_sure_if_im_having_my_period_or_bleeding/,Not sure if I'm having my period or bleeding heavily for the hell of it.,"My stupid landlord didn't fix the glass shower panel after I asked her many times (she just threatens to evict me if I ask for repairs) and it fell onto me on Sunday, hitting my left hip and lower back, where my surgeon hit my aterty last year in surgery and I now have a nerve injury. I got my ex to check over my back and front  (he's a doctor) and it all seems good. I didn't feel unwell, just sore as hell. 

It was day 19 of my cycle I got hit by the panel, I ovulated on day 12, so I was not expecting to start spotting so soon, as my cycle is normally 24-26 days, although the last one before was 33 days, and the one before that 21 days, but I've had some weight loss and nerve pain flares recently so I think my body just gave up having a cycle. I have no cramps. No PMS symptoms. I had a weird ovulation this month however, with black stool, fever like symptoms and halluncioations. So I think at this point my body is screwed. 

This morning i woke up, got in the bath and was shocked to find clots just floating in the tub. I felt super dizzy and my hands were shaking. I thought maybe it was the morning coffee lol. But then all day I've been bleeding heavily after 2 days of spotting with no other period symptoms. Went to the gym for physio, and by the time I got home I was fighting major fatigue and starting to feel nauseous. Had another bath (salt bath to help with nerve injury after exercise) and more clots in the tub. My MRI in July showed no endo regrowth from my surgery (a consulation prize after leaving me disabled with chronic nerve pain I guess). Ultrasounds all looked good with a fairly average follicle count (I have dimished ovarian reserve too, so this is a big one for me) I've got no appetite, going hot and cold, and just feel like crap, no nerve pain too ATM though, so that's a plus. 

I don't know if I should just say this is basically my period at this point. I was supposed to have hormone testing done this month on my blood work, but my suprise period kind of messed that up. I just feel so horrible and weak. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm not sure if it's time to send an email to my gyno team, but I had an MRI done 2 weeks ago and I'm interested to know what the results where of that first. I also had an early chemical in September, but my periods went back to normal after that 😭",1,1739897629.0,Endo,3,0.67,False

They sat across from us, eyes wide with curiosity, trying to make sense of what was in front of them.

She had a textbook open on the table, half-highlighted, with deadlines scribbled in the margins.

He wore a highschool ID lanyard, twirling it mindlessly between his fingers, and drumsticks shoved in his bag.

We ordered drinks—black for him, an iced matcha for me.

They both raised their brows, surprised.

""When did we start liking those?"" she asked.

""When life got busier, I guess,"" I said with a smile.

""So...how did this happen?"" he asked, glancing devilishly between us.

""You never spoke. Not once in high school nor in college."" my AP chimed in.

We laughed at the absurdity of it.

""We didn’t,"" I said, ""...not until years later. After life had already drawn the lines we were never supposed to cross.""

""But you did,"" she said, more statement than question, and with heavy judgement.

We exchanged a look.

""Yeah,"" he answered softly.
""We did.""

The younger versions of us sat back in their chairs, trying to grasp the story.

""Was it worth it?"" she asked, voice small.

""Would you do it again, knowing what you know now?""

I felt his hand brush against mine beneath the table.

""Every time,"" I said.

He nodded, squeezing my fingers.
""No question.""

She sighed, shaking her head.
""I thought we'd have it all figured out by now.""

""We never do,"" I replied. ""But we found something better. Something rare.""

We stood to leave, tossing a glance back at the table. 

They were still there, still wondering, still unsure. Eyes still clouded with questions. We stood to leave, knowing they'd only understand once life unfolded in its own unpredictable way.

""Three lifetimes huh?,"" she whispered as we disappeared through the door.

""Took us long enough,"" he added with a grin.

I’ve struggled with anxiety in the past but feel I’m well on my way to beating it. If you’re dealing with anxiety too, maybe we can be a source of support for each other, and if you’re looking for someone to go for walks or hikes with, or just coffee, then I’d especially love to hear from you!!

Anyways around late November he said he had to make a trip to the town I was in and he wanted to come see me,(mind you this man lived 3 1/2 hours away)  I was terrified but not in a bad way. we met of course it was awkward but I mean that's what happens when you meet someone online and your talking to them only online for so long...right? we went out for coffee for almost 2 hours it was nice and he came back to my dorm room. we tried to watch a movie but he wanted to talk instead so we did he made casual compliments and we were sitting up against each other, it started getting late and I mentioned how late it was and the travel for him back home would be late so we called it a night. We continued talking and I started really liking him while I could tell he really liked me before I did. we talked so much I got so attached to my phone. around December I went back home from uni and we kept talking back and fourth and I love it I really wanted to call him mine but I wanted him to be the one to ask that question. it was one night where he shared something about himself that I felt brought us closer and he mentioned he wanted to tell me that incase we decide to talk further. a few days go by and I notice it was me texting him goodmornign and goodnight first and asking him about his day, and trying to get conversation out form him. I started to notice he was pulling me back it hurt so bad I would constantly be telling my friends and I had a feeling in my head that this wouldn't work but I was in denial. I later that night messaged him after both saying goodnight that if he had time to call for a minute so we can actually talk that would be nice... he replied in the morning with ""idk. what if we don't work out"" and that was all I needed to hear in the moment so I said bye and unaided him. part me felt so free and empowered but I realised quickly I missed him so much...... I never blocked him on any social media only unaided him on snap I left the door closed but not locked for him to reach out to me just incase. fast forward to a couple nights ago I was telling my friend how I wanted closure I just wanted to know if it was something about me that made him change his mind. so I added him back and he added me back right away and messaged me he was dry but still talked to me I later found out from asking the most in depth questions to him to get something from him about why he just became dry, he explained to me that he told his brothers about me and they then threatened to tell his parents about me because I wasn't from where he was from, I lived to far away, and I wasn Mennonite, and apparently because where I am form I wouldn't support the farming career. I was and am so hurt that he wasn't going to say goodbye he was going to let me just stay there until I got to tired of reaching out, his parents were going to kick him out if he kept talking to me, and I understand the situation but I just feel like I deserved a goodbye and a reason instead of me re-reaching out.

Years ago when I didn’t have steady work, I decided to move 4 hours away and work and live with my aunt and work at her mom n pop restaurant. It was a small place with about 10 tables. It was often very busy and I often worked 10-13 hour days with little to no break. As a us army veteran, I was trained to be unselfish and that mission always came first. So I treated the restaurant like my unit and pushed myself hard every day for my aunts place. Unfortunately unlike the army, some co workers didn’t rally behind me. In fact, they sought to take advantage of my willingness to work hard. 

My cousin (aunts son) also worked there as a server like me. I worked on a consistent schedule and only took Fridays off. My cousin on the other hand, was a bit more free form and would come into work and take days off at random with little to no warning. He’d often show up hours late and leave early. The only exception to this was Fridays when he knew I wasn’t scheduled to come in. It would be Fridays that he’d actually show up on time and stay until closing because he didn’t want to be hounded by his mom. Of course, he’d do whatever he wanted whenever I was at work cause his mom wouldn’t hound him. Why? Cause I was busting my ass doing the jobs of 2-3 people at times. This went on for several years and I started to grow tired of my cousins constant random work shifts. 

My cousin is a closeted shopaholic and loves to go shopping. Obviously for the many years I was working at the restaurant this meant he couldn’t go out on Black Friday since I was always scheduled off. However, during one particularly busy Thanksgiving weekend, my aunt asked me if I would forgo my one day off and come in on Friday as we were already short staffed. Remembering how busy Thursday was with it just being me, I decide to do the unselfish thing and agree to come in on a Friday. We already had a stacked schedule for Friday with tons of catering orders and a full dining room so I wanted to be a team player. 

Friday morning rolls around and I head into work. My cousin isn’t there yet but about 30 minutes in, I see him pull into the parking lot in his car. As I’m taking the order from a nearby table, I see him walk towards the restaurant, open the door, spots me, stops dead in his tracks, turns around and walks away. I catch this all as I’m taking the tables order. I figured he forgot something out of his car. But a moment later, I see the car leave. Again I figured he forgot something or wants to get a coffee first. 

Well an hour later and he doesn’t come back. And by then the restaurant is at full capacity. I’m frantically running around taking orders, bussing tables, answering phones, running the register, cleaning spills, and preparing drinks all while wondering where he ran off to. 5 hours into my shift and I assume he’s not coming back. I’m wondering if he suddenly got ill. We close at 9 pm and I’m a total wreck. Completely exhausted and sitting down to my first real break of the day. As I’m mopping the floor, who comes in now but my cousin. He brings in tons of bags from different stores and starts bringing out all the crap he bought while out Black Friday shopping. 

“Man there were so many great sales today!” He says as he pulls out a random shirt from H&M. His mom comes out and I think expected her to give him a tongue lashing for not showing up on such a busy day. But instead she starts going through the bags of merchandise and starts to comment on it. I felt so dejected. I didn’t take a day off because I was asked to come in to help the very same cousin who was scheduled to work alone. But instead, he saw me at work unexpectedly and decided to take advantage and take the day off. Of course, his mom didn’t complain cause I busted my ass and didn’t take a piss all day to cover his lazy ass. 

I felt angry. But I also felt sad. I felt like I was worthless. I felt like I was only on this earth to make life easier for other people. I felt like I didn’t matter. I had no friends in the area. All I was a server. Someone that people saw when they were hungry. To some, I wasn’t even human. I was a servant. I was scum. I hated this situation and I had enough. I wanted to show my cousin and aunt exactly how they drove me to this with their selfish behavior. So I sent a mass text to 3 friends telling them I was going to k*ll myself. I looked for some bleach in the janitors closet and thought it might be painless if I mixed it with lemonade. I was in tears at home staring at the bottle of bleach and gallon of lemonade I was planning to mix it with. That’s when my friend Deena called me. 

She spent the next 2 hours talking to me and she eventually convinced me to not k*ll myself. Deena also lived about an hour away and said she would personally drive there that night to make sure I didn’t do anything crazy. To this day, I’m thankful for her for saving me that night. 

For the next several months, I started to take better care of myself. I asked for a second day off on my schedule which my cousin naturally hated. He started to complain that I was getting lazy but I also was secretly planning to quit and move back home closer to my mom and sister. One day, I told both my aunt and cousin that I was moving back home but I’d stay on for 2 more months so I can help train a replacement. My cousin, being more pissed that his ticket to an easy job was leaving, told me “why fuckin wait 2 months. If you don’t want to be here, then leave. We don’t need your ass so get the fuck out!”

With that, I packed my bags and moved back home. At first my aunt thought this was just temporary and I was just bowing off some steam. She said I can return to work whenever I’m ready but I took a chance and applied for an engineering job, which was my major in college. I got hired and I’ve been happily working as an engineer now for years. I’m making far more than I ever did at my aunts restaurant and I have way more time off. My cousin had the “you’ll come crawling back attitude” but the restaurant actually closed 2 years ago. My aunt said it was cause she wanted to retire but several regular customers whom I kept in touch with say it was more likely due to business going down after I left as once word got out how poorly they treated me, most people didn’t want to give them their business. 

So here I am today. I haven’t spoken with my cousin since he told me to leave and I don’t know what he does now but I do know that night he ditched work to go Black Friday shopping was a dark time for me but I’m glad I managed to turn it into a positive. If this has taught me anything, it’s that no amount of money is worth your mental health. Yes in the army, we were asked to do some crazy things but the army was a team and I shouldn’t expect civilians to have the same mindset as me. 

I’d love to hear some thoughts and comments about my story and again if anyone is ever having thoughts of “unaliving” themselves then to please seek help. I’m pretty sure at least one person out there cares.

We are thinking of planning the following itinerary for a 5 day trip we have coming up between March 12 and March 17. Would appreciate any advice or call outs on aspects we may be overlooking (logistics, accomodation locations, driving times, events, must-dos, etc.).

We plan on visiting again in the future so have semi-decided to skip over Vieques/Culebra this trip after much debate, as we want some epic West Coast sunsets, but we are open to adding it back in. We also decided against the bioluminescent bay this time around (full moon and also don't want to kayak in the dark), though maybe worth it one night swimming in La Parguera while on the West Coast? Not sure if this could work logistically.

This trip is for a 30th birthday celebration (on the 15th), so would appreciate any advice or suggestions to make that day or overall unforgettable. We really want to a blend of casual and relaxing fun, and gorgeous swimmable beaches.

We really aren't thrilled about the idea of having to jump around different accomodations every night but also want to experience a decent amount of the island. So any advice on locations/places to stay to are appreciated! I've bolded areas that I need to figure out still, and the food choices aren't set in stone. \[I used ChatGPT to help refine my itinerary.\]

TLTR: we matched 1x on Tinder and 2x on Bumble and he basically ghosted me each time, but we've never met. I know I should count my ""losses"" but I am still really curious about meeting this guy at least once 😂 I think he's quite cute, lives right in my area and we're both into martial arts (he has his own gym). His profile says he's looking for something serious. I know if he was really interested he wouldn't ghost me but have the slight hope if we met at least once things could go somewhere 😅 also I'm quite forgiving until the first date but wouldn't tolerate this behavior if we had more contact.
In the meantime I matched with other guys and went on a date with someone, but I'm still curious about this guy 😅 

I already triple-texted him, so I should know better but I'm thinking about trying to match again to get things rolling a last time 😂 i know he's been active on Bumble because his location changed. 


Long Version:
I matched with this guy the first time on Tinder right in the beginning of January and after the exchange of two messages (he wrote hey, I asked if he had a good start into the new year) he didn't answer for a week until I deleted the app and switched to Bumble. Well, after a few days he also created a Bumble profile and we matched again. I wrote the first message and asked him jokingly if we should try again here on Bumble 😂 he answered ""yes, most gladly"" but then proceeded to ghost me again after I answered his ice breaker option 👻😂

After another week I unmatched. 2 weeks later on a Tuesday (end of January) he probably deleted his account and created a new one because his profile showed up again as ""new"" 😂 As curious as I am I swiped left again and a few hours later we got our third match 😂 I shot the first message immediately and finally a conversation formed something along the lines:
Me:""😂😂😂😂 I'm crying right now 😂""
Him: ""why? Haha""
Me: ""because you already ghosted me twice""
Him: ""why do you swipe left on me then? Haha Sorry I'm bad at texting""
Me: ""because it's an experiment for me now and I've got nothing to lose. But why are YOU swiping left if you don't text back anyway?""
Him: ""because I think you're pretty, what am I supposed to do?""
Then he asked if I want to meet up for a glass of wine. But since it would have been pretty late until he was done with teaching his classes, he asked if I would want to come over to his place at 9:30 PM 🙄🚩 Obviously I declined.  He then asked if I would want to come over to his gym which would have been okay for me. But after I asked for the address he didn't reply. At 1AM he apologized and said his phone died followed by a ""good night 😘"".

The following days we exchanged some short messages but his texts were reallllyyy dryyyy asf, but he tried to initiate. Then he asked me on a Saturday if I would like to go to the thermal spa with him 🙄🚩🚩🚩 I declined again and told him I prefer a more ""neutral"" setting for a first date (either he's a typical F-boy or just really oblivious thinking this would be good options for a first date?!). No more answer.
Obviously I shouldn't try again, he's probably just a F-boy. But 2 days later on Monday I asked if everything's alright and made a light hearted 30 sec voice message how his suggestions for a first date are not suitable for me since I'm looking for a serious relationship (and thought he would, too) but I'm still open to meet up for some drinks or coffee. Still no answer.
On Thursday I went on a date with another guy but it didn't click for me and didn't want to pursue this further.

Obviously nobody with a working brain would send a third message now. But I wanted to give it a final try 😂 on Friday (6 days after he asked about going to the spa and his last message) I asked again if he was still interested to meet up and if he would want to grab a coffee on the weekend. Guess what? 🥁 No answer 😂 But he seemed quite active in Bumble since his location changed multiple times. Our chat is now archived, he didn't unmatch neither did I. My Last message was almost 2 weeks ago.


I KNOW he's obviously not that interested but since I'm about to delete Bumble and want to quit online dating for a while, should I try one last time to get a date? 😂 Or just delete the app and if he's still on there in a few months try again then? 
As you may already see I don't care about embarrassing myself but I would have higher standards once we met up.",0,1739896464.0,Bumble,23,0.42,False

1isgrzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1isgrzx/the_power_of_small_gestures/,The Power of Small Gestures,"Never Stop Doing Little Things for Others**

In a world that often feels dominated by grand gestures and ostentatious displays of kindness, it is essential to remember the profound impact of small acts of kindness. These seemingly insignificant actions frequently occupy the biggest part of our hearts and can create ripples of positivity that extend far beyond their immediate context. The act of doing little things for others fosters connections, nurtures relationships, and cultivates a culture of empathy and compassion.

### The Importance of Little Acts

Little acts of kindness may include something as simple as a smile, holding the door for someone, or sending a thoughtful text to check on a friend. While these gestures may appear trivial, they carry the profound ability to uplift spirits, brighten someone’s day, and instill a sense of belonging. Research has shown that acts of kindness, even when small or spontaneous, can trigger the release of oxytocin, a hormone that enhances feelings of connection and happiness. This biochemical response highlights why such gestures can resonate deeply with both the giver and the receiver.

### The Accumulative Effect

Over time, these little acts accumulate and weave a fabric of support, compassion, and love within our communities. Consider the impact of consistently being kind; a simple coffee bought for a colleague, a compliment offered to a stranger, or taking a moment to listen to a friend in need can set off a chain reaction. When people experience kindness, they are more likely to pay it forward, creating an ever-expanding network of goodwill. 

Moreover, engaging in little acts of kindness contributes to our mental well-being. Studies indicate that people who prioritize kindness and compassion experience lower rates of depression and anxiety. This is not just about the recipients; the giver reaps rewards, fostering a sense of purpose and community. 

### Cultivating a Kind Mindset

Embracing a mindset centered around kindness begins with conscious awareness. Here are some practical steps to incorporate little acts of kindness into your daily routine:

1. **Practice Gratitude**: Acknowledging the small joys in life can inspire you to extend gratitude to those around you and recognize opportunities for kindness.

2. **Be Attentive**: Pay attention to the needs and feelings of others. Sometimes, a simple gesture can be the highlight of someone's day when they feel seen and heard.

3. **Set Kindness Goals**: Challenge yourself to perform a certain number of small acts each week. It could be as simple as complimenting a stranger or helping a neighbor.

4. **Engage with Your Community**: Participate in community service or volunteer work. Helping others in tangible ways strengthens your social ties and fosters goodwill.

5. **Share Your Kindness**: Use social media platforms or local community boards to celebrate random acts of kindness, inspiring others to join in.

### The Lasting Impact

The beauty of these little acts is that they often create lasting memories. A heartfelt thank-you note can brighten someone’s week, while making a meal for a friend might remind them that they aren’t alone during tough times. These small gestures demonstrate that we care, that we are thinking of others, and that we are willing to put in the effort to create a supportive environment.

Moreover, little acts of kindness carry an inherent universality; kindness transcends cultural, social, and economic barriers. In times of crisis, it reminds us of our shared humanity and the importance of standing together. 

### Conclusion: A Call to Action

In conclusion, never underestimate the power of little things. They may take but a moment's thought and effort yet can occupy the biggest part of someone's heart. As we navigate our daily lives, let's remain committed to performing these small acts of kindness. By doing so, we enrich not only the lives of others but also our own. In a world rife with challenges, let us choose kindness and carry on the ripple effect of compassion, one little act at a time.

Remember, as Aesop once said, “No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.” Let's keep doing little things for others—because, in the grand tapestry of life, these threads of kindness matter the most.

1isgrt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1isgrt3/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 18/02/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

So when my laptop started & we were working, she suddenly sat close to me that her breasts were squeezing around my shoulder, I was shocked for a second that something spongey is touching my shoulder, what's that? While my attention was in work, then I noticed after maybe 7-8 seconds, so i slowly took my hand far from her(so she wouldn't notice if something wrong was happening), but whenever any aruguable point arised in design, she would come more closer again to point out my mistake in design, and THAT thing would happen again....

This scenario was repeated atleast for 8-10 minutes while we were working on laptop for maybe 20-25 minutes, there were only possibilities were there: 

1. either she was giving me hints or flirting with me (not possible at all, I don't think this would happen at all, 0.0001% chances)

2. She had trust on me as friend so much that, she wasn't caring about this scenario happening while we were working...

So according to 2nd possibility, i was happy that someone trust on me this much, i became a trustworthy ig(+200 aura)....

Second scenario happened when I was eating burger at some mid-restuarant while I was with my THAT friend in earlier incident & Her other female friend, which wanted to meet me & this meeting was suggested by my THAT bestie & my other male friend which slided in for meeting....

So while I was eating burger, whole chunk of my patty(of burger) dropped on table and it looked like mess🥲, and then my male friend & HER gave that look(😒) which was scolding me & starred straightly deep into my soul like ""yaar tuje dhang se ak burger khana bi nahi aata, muskil se is larki ko pata k layi thi tere liye, ab ise lagega is gavaar ko burger khana bi nahi aata, kitta niche gir gya sab, ab muje maat bolna Girlfriend banva de"" type... (I am too much clumsy type)...

Then in top of that, my paper staw of cold coffee got almost dissolved, so I took it out & placed in other empty glass(from my POV), plot twist: it was not empty, it was that new girl's mocktail glass which still contained significant mocktail at end which she saved to drink at later... So thing was I had put full coffee wali wet half dissolved straw in her glass, so mocktail me coffee gir gayi thori straw se jisse mocktail kharab ho gya....(FULL ON CHOMUGIRI KARDI: -200 Aura)

*   **e.l.f. Satin Lipstick:** Striking the perfect balance between matte and ⁣glossy, e.l.f. satin lipstick ⁢delivers⁢ a‌ pleasant, creamy texture ⁣with​ a subtle sheen. These lipsticks offer a polished, everyday look, providing ⁢ample hydration and color⁤ payoff without⁤ feeling heavy or drying. The e.l.f. O FACE Satin Lipstick is a particularly popular choice.

*   **e.l.f. Hydrating Lipstick:** If your ⁢lips are prone to dryness, e.l.f. hydrating lipstick is⁣ a must-have.‌ These⁢ formulas are infused with nourishing ingredients like ‌shea butter, jojoba oil, or ​vitamin E‍ to​ keep your lips soft, smooth, and moisturized throughout the day.

2.  ⁤**e.l.f. SRSLY Satin Lipstick:** another amazing contender in the satin category, the e.l.f.

1isgj6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1isgj6z/100_days_since_my_last_cigarette_heres_what_ive/,100 Days Since My Last Cigarette. Here's What I've Learned So Far,"100 days. It's wild to think I’ve made it this far, and there's still a long way to go, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I wanted to share some of the  things I’ve learned in the last three months. If you're trying to quit or considering it, I hope this helps and maybe gives you some insight.

**1. The cravings still happen, but they’re manageable now.**  
At first, cravings were intense. I’d find myself reaching for a cigarette out of habit, especially in certain situations—like after meals, with coffee, or while driving. At Day 100, cravings are rare and don’t hit nearly as hard. When they do come, I’ve learned to distract myself—go for a walk, chew gum, or just breathe deeply. I’ve also noticed that cravings are more mental than physical now, and I can power through them in minutes. It’s been a huge win.

**2. I don’t need cigarettes to handle stress anymore.**  
One of the biggest things I didn’t expect was how much smoking was my way of managing stress. I used to grab a cigarette anytime I felt overwhelmed, anxious, or irritated. Now, I’ve had to relearn how to handle those feelings. What has also helped a ton has been listening to calming piano music when I'm feeling stressed instead of having a smoke. This playlist has helped me through some rough times over the past few months: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sRYWF8QV9nHjma4DLrRkB?si=83550bc6d65a497d](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sRYWF8QV9nHjma4DLrRkB?si=83550bc6d65a497d)

**3. My sense of smell and taste is so much better.**  
I can’t believe how much I missed out on before. Food tastes richer, and I can actually smell things again! It’s crazy to think that I used to eat bland meals because I couldn’t taste much. Also, the scent of flowers, coffee, and even fresh air? So much more vivid.

**4. My skin is clearer and my lungs feel better.**  
This is one of the things I didn’t expect to notice so soon, but my skin looks noticeably clearer. I’ve had fewer breakouts, and I just feel like my skin is more vibrant. I also used to wake up in the morning feeling congested, and that’s gone. It’s incredible to realize just how much smoking was impacting my body in ways I didn’t even realize.

**5. I still have moments where I think about smoking.**  
Even at Day 100, there are still moments when I feel like lighting up—especially when I’m in social situations where people are smoking. It’s a reminder that quitting is a process, not an event. But I’ve learned that I don’t have to give in. I’ve learned to sit with the discomfort for a few minutes, and it always passes. 

**6. I’ve gained a lot more self-respect.**  
The best part about being smoke-free for 100 days isn’t the physical changes or the money I’m saving—it’s the way I see myself now. I don’t feel controlled by nicotine anymore. I’m finally doing something that’s good for me, and that feels empowering. I don’t need cigarettes to define me. Every day I choose not to smoke is a small act of self-respect. And that’s something I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

Hope this helps any of you who are thinking about quitting. It's hard, but it's been the best decision I've ever made",15,1739895730.0,stopsmoking,3,1.0,False

1isgdqk,https://i.redd.it/0j6f9ui7axje1.png,Stained Filling After Less Than 1 year,"- I don't smoke cigarettes, occasionally marijuana 
- I don't drink coffee or dark tea 
- have massively reduced sugar intake 
- I oil pull, floss daily, and brush 2-3 times using remineralizing toothpaste 
- genetic history of not great teeth, used to suffer from eating disorder and alcohol addiction but have been sober from both for years. 

Last year I got my front fillings done, which I was already extremely anxious about because the decay was becoming very obvious and I was nervous it would come out bad. 
When I first got it done, it looked fine. I was happy with it. I noticed that the edges around the front tooth filling were extremely rough, and my floss would snag/rip on it though. The dentist also seemed to have accidentally left some filling between my teeth that hardened and would tear my floss. I got that fixed at my next appointment. It also didn't perfectly match my tooth color, but I can get over that easily. 
I noticed the dark staining around the filling maybe 5-6 months after getting the filling. I am baffled and really embarrassed by it, because the stained filling is now more obvious than the original decay on the tooth was. The edges around the front filling are also still quite raised and bumpy. 

I've made an appointment to talk to my dentist and hopefully get it re-done, but my enamel looks so thin I'm scared it will destroy my tooth more. I also am worried that they will make me pay for it and I am quite low income. The dentist who did my fillings has seemingly moved offices now and I only saw her the 2 appointments when she did my fillings. 
I guess my question for dentists is:

Is this level of staining normal for less than one year of a filling? 
Would you make a patient pay to get this re-done? ",2,1739895364.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
