I feel like the Reactin is making me super fatigued.  I couldn’t even open my eyes this morning and my body is so heavy. I’ve also quit coffee and am not eating much at all (for about 2.5 weeks).

I’m used to making simple espressos in a basic machine (with pre-ground Bustello) but I’ve never really tried making anything more than that. I realize this machine makes it for me but I’m curious to hear tips and what ingredient choices make the drinks even better. 

For example what kind of “milk” goes in the container for making cappuccinos etc? We usually have store bought flavored creamer (chobani) and whole milk in the fridge. 

Also, I plan on getting some whole bean coffees, does the kind of beans used matter other than for flavor? I realize the flavor profile of a light roast vs dark roast is supposed to be different. But is there a specific type of bean to use for espresso v cappuccino vs other milk+coffee drinks?

1pp0mro,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1pp0mro/were_losing_money_on_everyday_food_and_nobody/,We’re losing money on everyday food and nobody seems to care!!!,"Random thought that’s been bugging me.

Everyone keeps talking about the impact of GST on cars, phones, ACs etc. Fair. Big money.

But why is nobody talking about food especially when GST actually reduced taxes on many everyday food items. Which should’ve meant either lower prices or more quantity for us. Instead, the change was so small - a few paise, a few grams that most of us didn’t even notice. 

This is exactly why consumer awareness matters, and why we actually need to read labels and question what we’re paying for, and take responsibility for our money. 

But that’s exactly how this flies under the radar.

Let me put it simply.

If I buy a biscuit pack that says ₹4.50 MRP, but the shopkeeper sells it to me for ₹5 (because who carries 50 paise change?) - I just paid extra.

Now scale it.

Parle-G sells around 1 billion biscuits every month of which \~70% would be small value packs – 700 million

Their small packs are often priced at ₹4.45/₹4.50 MRP.

But be honest, how many of us actually pay ₹4.45 at a kirana?

Most shops charge ₹5, because:

No one has 55 paise change

No one argues over ₹0.55

So what happens?

Consumer pays: ₹5

Printed value: ₹4.45

Extra paid: ₹0.55 

Which technically also means that I’m paying the same money for a reduced quantity

Now do the math:

₹0.55 × 700,000,000, biscuits = ₹38.5 crore EXTRA paid every month!!!

That’s ₹462 crore a year from consumers!!! 

Not as tax. Straight into retailer margins.

And from a consumer point of view, that money is gone, no matter who pockets it.

And this is only for ₹5 packs for ONE brand. Now think about what a ₹1 difference on a ₹10 pack and for several brands mean!!!

That’s the part nobody talks about. GST benefits are supposed to be passed on to consumers, but at this level, that benefit clearly isn’t reaching us.

People say “arre ₹1 hi toh hai”.

But at scale, ₹1 is never ₹1. It’s school fees, groceries, fuel, savings… Quietly leaking out because everyday food feels too cheap to question.

And this is just one biscuit brand. Now imagine snacks, chocolates, tea & coffee sachets…

This isn’t a pricing glitch. It’s a systemic everyday loss that consumers have just normalised.

This makes me wonder if we are okay paying full price for less product just because it’s “only” ₹5 or ₹10? Or is this one of those things we’ve accepted because it happens too quietly, too often?

Genuinely curious what others think, because once you start noticing it… it’s everywhere. 

Do you think this is just practical reality, or something consumers should actually start pushing back on?",1,1765988172.0,AskIndia,1,1.0,False

Hey Maximizers! 👋

Feeling like you're just going through the motions sometimes? Like there's a dial on your happiness that could be turned up, but you're not quite sure how? I get it. We're all here striving for more, for *better*, and sometimes that ""better"" feels just out of reach.

Today, I wanted to share a few little shifts that have made a *huge* difference in my own daily optimization and, more importantly, in boosting that genuine, everyday happiness. These aren't grand, life-altering pronouncements, but small, actionable tweaks that can compound over time.

Let's dive in:

*   **Morning Micro-Wins:** Forget the pressure of an hour-long workout and meditation session the second you wake up. Start small. Maybe it's 5 minutes of stretching, a few deep breaths, or even just writing down *one* thing you're grateful for. These tiny victories set a positive tone for the rest of your day. It's about building momentum, not perfection.

*   **The ""Power of Three"" Approach:** Instead of a never-ending to-do list, pick *three* non-negotiable tasks for the day. These are the things that will move the needle forward, the tasks that, if completed, will make you feel accomplished. Focus your energy on these, and anything else is a bonus. It combats overwhelm and brings clarity.

*   **Scheduled ""Joy Sprints"":** We get so caught up in productivity that we forget to schedule in what actually makes us *feel good*. This could be listening to your favorite podcast on your commute, calling a friend for a quick chat, stepping outside for 10 minutes of sunshine, or even just enjoying a really good cup of coffee without distractions. These ""joy sprints"" are crucial for emotional refueling.

*   **Mindful Transitions:** The space *between* tasks is where a lot of our mental clutter can accumulate. Instead of rushing from one thing to the next, take a breath. Acknowledge what you just finished, and then consciously shift your focus to what's next. This simple practice can prevent that feeling of being scattered.

*   **Digital Decluttering, Daily:** Our screens are constant sources of input. Try a quick digital declutter before bed or first thing in the morning. Unfollow accounts that drain your energy, unsubscribe from unnecessary emails, and clear your desktop. A cleaner digital space often leads to a clearer mind.

It's a journey, right? Some days these tips will flow effortlessly, and other days... well, we'll try again tomorrow. And that's okay!

If you ever find yourself feeling overwhelmed or struggling to navigate these emotional ups and downs, please remember you're not alone. Sometimes, having a dedicated space and support system can make all the difference.

1pp0jcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1pp0jcm/i_stopped_trying_to_quit_my_phone_and_just/,"I stopped trying to ""quit"" my phone and just changed what I fed it. The mental quiet is surprising.","A few months ago, I was at a pretty low point. My brain felt like a browser with 100 tabs open that I couldn't close.

I would wake up, grab my phone, and immediately flood my system with news, emails, and other people's lives. By the time I actually got out of bed, I felt exhausted. I tried the whole ""put the phone in another room"" thing, but I always relapsed because, honestly, I rely on my phone for alarms and work.

I realized the problem wasn't the phone itself; it was the **volume** of input.

So I tried a ""Single Input"" rule. I decided that for the first hour of the day, I was allowed to look at my screen, but I was only allowed to consume **one single piece of information**.

I started using a minimal app called [Harmoni](https://getharmoni.app/app).

It’s designed to be anti-scroll. It just gives you one quote or thought for the day. I read it, sit with it for 30 seconds while the coffee brews, and that’s it.

It’s strange how much this tiny switch changed my pacing. Instead of my brain racing to catch up with a feed, it slows down to digest one thing. It feels like the difference between chugging an energy drink and sipping tea.

I know using an app to live simply sounds contradictory, but for me, it acted as a filter. It turned my phone from a firehose into a faucet.

Denji can be dense sometimes but he can also be rather perceptive and clever, you'd think one of the first thoughts would be: ""Makima wanted me to be as miserable as possible, wanted Pochita at any cost, and was controlling my whole life. Wtf happened to Reze? Is Makima why she never showed up?""

At this point Kishibe might have been too preoccupied with other matters or lacked the knowledge or resources to know himself, but I still find it rather odd that Denji never asks or thinks about Reze. I can get Denji maybe missing Reze the 2 other times they fought because it was Pochita and the Pochita drone doing the fighting, but this feels like one of the few plot holes and hiccups in part 1 which is otherwise so tightly and amazingly written.

As painful as it is, I can respect the storytelling weight of Reze dying in the alley, and being that lingering curse for Denji and us, but with her still being alive in the verse at times it feels like the plot and characters bend around in contrived angles to maintain that curse.   
  
Closest explanation/excuse I can come to is Denji maybe just being so traumatized that he avoids even the most basic memories and thoughts of those he lost. It does take a lot of time deep into part 2 and Pochita triggering memories with coffee and snow to get Denji finally thinking on part 1 folk.

Digital Twins)

AI avatars, also called digital twins, are photorealistic digital replicas of real people created using artificial intelligence. These avatars can look, sound, and even behave like their human counterparts, capable of speaking multiple languages, appearing in videos, and conducting conversations, all without requiring the original person to be present.

**Why Business Owners Should Care:**

Think of AI avatars as your digital spokesperson that never sleeps, never gets sick, and can be in multiple places at once. Here’s what makes them powerful:

* **24/7 availability**: Your avatar can host meetings, create content, or engage customers while you sleep
* **Scalability**: One recording session creates an avatar that can produce unlimited content
* **Multilingual reach**: Speak to global audiences in their native languages even if you don’t speak it
* **Time savings**: CEOs report spending 72% of their time in meetings, avatars can handle some of these

**Real-World Impact:**

* Zoom’s CEO Eric Yuan used his AI avatar to deliver quarterly earnings call comments
* Klarna’s CEO sent his digital twin to speak during financial updates
* H&M created digital twins of 30 models for marketing campaigns, with models retaining full ownership rights
* Malaysian creator Bella Khann (1.4M TikTok followers) uses her avatar for 24/7 live commerce streams

**The Bottom Line:** AI avatars aren’t about replacing humans—they’re about extending your reach and reclaiming your time. While you focus on strategy and relationship-building, your digital twin handles the repetitive tasks.

1pp0fzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1pp0fzc/how_much_salt_in_coffee/,How much salt in coffee?,"This might be a stupid question, but i wanna ask it here because the responses in another subreddit were so rude lol.

How much added salt is needed for a cup of coffee to match the salt on our tastebuds? Does it naturally have enough? If not, is there a detailed reason we don’t add salt to our coffee like we add salt to our eggs?

I hope this is a safe space I’m new to the chemistry of cooking 😭

1pp0fqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1pp0fqu/opened_our_relationship_and_the_first_encounter/,Opened our relationship and the first encounter was handled badly - am I overreacting/ what do I do?,"My partner and I of almost four years just started non-mono a couple months back, agreeing we are each other’s nesting partner and we can have our fun (we both agree that sex with others doesn’t constitute cheating) and it’s been really exciting for us both in fantasy and in planning our own erotic lives outside of our relationship. BUT I think they’ve handled their first sexual encounter terribly and I’m not sure she’s the right person to being doing non-monogomy with. I’d really just love some feedback on this to see if I’m missing anything or advice on how to repair this situation…

I always expected the first of us to sleep with someone else would trigger some initial discomfort that would take some skilled communication of reassurance and repair. But I think this has triggered discomfort and a level of inappropriateness that goes beyond what is reasonable to expect here…

Basically she done foreplay with her flatmate after he entered her room post flirty movie time! (I think it all sounded very sexy and am still totally into this). It was similtaniously nerve wracking, exciting and totally arousing. But the discomfort reached new levels when:

A) she told me this while we sat at the bar in the cafe my mum works in, totally out of the blue with no preparation – despite just having spent the night together – all the while my mum is in front of us on the other side of the bar occupied with making coffee. This felt like THE MOST inappropriate place to bring this up and I felt totally overwhelmed and caught so off-guard.

B) She actually had been sitting on telling me despite her being with me for the last week for a couple days at a stretch, which (she admitted) would have been to opportune time to tell me and she didn’t! (We have sexy non-mono chat fairly frequently over those days and had lots of 1:1 hangout time).

C) And – is the part where I hit new levels of discomfort – she got with this flatmate both knowing that he had a long-distance relationship that is monog. I just really think this on top of B) and A) is the peak of the shady execution in communicating and conducting all of this!

I have always been the better communicator among us and thought we had a really good understanding of honesty and trust, to the point where I thought we’d be solid in going into non-mono and figuring it out. But the summary of this that: A) there was totally inappropriate context of disclosure that felt really thoughtless and careless; B) the delayed disclosure felt really unnecessary; and C) our values are not attuned in terms of doing this when everyone involved is knowingly consented (viz, the flatmates girlfriend).

I still think we can figure this out and learn from this and it’s just a tough initial hick up that was – for no good reason as far as I can tell – handled really badly. But right now, I feel quite weird about the way she has gone about this and just wonder if I’m being naive and how to move forward together from here!

Any advice and thoughts would be massively appreciated cause I’m still trying to process this! Thank you all!",0,1765987717.0,nonmonogamy,1,0.5,False

*I saw him running through our field one day. It was dead o’ winter, and he weren’t wearin' nothin' but a big tarp around hisself. I 'membered we had just logged out that area a bit ago so there was still lots of tracks from skidders and what not. Would get real muddy out there everytime it rained or snow melted. He went through there chasin' a racoon. He followed it all the ways up to our porch and cornered it in my trash can. Made such an awful racket. Kept hearin’ a loud thumpin’ sound like he was beatin’ that thing to death on my steps. My husband went out with the his gun and started hollerin’ at that man, tellin' him get off the porch, get off our land. I heard him shoot, but I’m sure it was just at the sky. I couldn’t imagine Bill shootin' nobody. I don’t recall ever seeing that man again, but about once or twice a week my trash can on the porch would be all upset. Stuff would be throwed out all over the place. One time I had a casserole get pushed to the back of the fridge for a couple months. I didn’t see it and forgot about it until it started to stink. It got so bad I just threw the whole dish out. I put the lid on it good and tight, but one mornin’ when them trash cans had been stirred up, I saw the lid had been ripped off of that dish and that whole casserole was gone. I can’t imagine anyone, man or varmit, would have ever ate that. Bill told me it was just them racoons. I guess it coulda been. But that don’t account for when I hear someone breathin' real hard outside the window.*



Denver sits down in the tree line at the edge of a field. The heat from his face fogs up the thick lenses of his glasses. The cold air rushes through the holes in his jeans and t-shirt. He pulls the dingy green sockhat from his back pocket and stuffs his hands into it. He waits in frigid air for some meat to come into his view. 



For the last couple years, he has made do with rabbits and squirrels from his traps, but occasionally he finds himself a bit of a deer carcass here and there. Sometimes it’s leftover from a predator, sometimes it’s what's left behind when some hunters take the horns or backstraps and leave the rest. Denver always detested this kind of waste. But, on the other hand, someone else’s sin meant a blessing for him. 



About a week ago, Denver came upon a dead hunter who had apparently had a heart attack in the woods. He was out checking his traps when he saw the man bent over the edge of a tree stand. Denver hid at first, but seeing the man remain motionless for several minutes, told him he had no eyes from which to hide. 



He approached the hunter. He was old. Denver found his hunting rifle, a lever-action 30-30, lying next to the tree with a rope tied around it, meant to hoist it up after the hunter had climbed into his perch. Denver checked the gun. It was loaded. He looked around at the silent forest and back up at the hunter. He climbed the tree stand and checked the man’s pockets for spare ammo. He found five extra rounds in the breast pocket of the man’s coat. When he returned to the ground, he picked up the rifle, looked about the forest one last time, and then carried on with his new treasure. 



It was with the same rifle he now seeks to kill his own fresh deer. He breathes into his bare hands, rubs the moist air between his palms, and stuffs them back into the hat. The scratches on his glasses make it hard to see, but he believes he spots a deer coming from the tree line opposite him. He picks up his rifle, puts bead on it, and fires. The smack of the bullet against flesh makes him smile. His excitement is diluted when the deer runs into the leafless trees, indicating a long time tracking. 



He finds the blood trail. Luckily, it’s easy to follow, but it’s a long time walking before he finds his bounty. The trail leads him winding through the woods, down hollers, over fallen trees. He finally finds the deer in a new field, one he has never visited. The deer lays in the tall dead grass. The hole in its side stands out like a red badge against the dull brown of the fur. He approaches the animal with his pocket knife drawn. He stoops to field dress the animal when he hears the click of a gun’s hammer at the side of his head. 



Above him stands a tall man, layered in warm camo and a bright orange vest. 



M: Just what do you think you’re doing?

D: This is my deer.

M: You ain't got no deer out here, son. 

D: I shot him out yonder. I tracked him here. 

M: I shot this deer. You get on. 



Denver slowly stood up with his hands raised. He pivoted to look the man in the eye and realized he knew him.



D: That you, Paul Thompson?

P: Don’t use my name when I don’t know yours.

D: It’s Denver.

P: I don’t know no Denver.

D: Sure you do. You taught me in eighth grade.

P: If that’s true, then it’s Mr. Thompson to you.

D: Mr. Thompson.



Mr. Thompson lowers his rifle. He looks over Denver as if either trying to remember or decide something. 



P: I don’t know you. Get off my property. 

D: Sure. Can I take my deer?

P: I told you you ain't got no deer out here. 

D: What you gonna do with it?

P: None of your business. I done told you to leave. I’ve been nice cause you said you was a student, you understand?

D: Yessir.

P: Now get. What I do with my deer is my business. 

D: Yessir.



Denver looks down at the deer for a moment. When Mr. Thompson lets out a long sigh, he turns and goes back the way he came, using the blood trail as a guide. A lot of work done for no gain. Denver returns to his camp empty-handed.  



It’s night when he reaches his camp. A fallen tree bridges the two banks of a wet-weather creek bed.  A blue tarp with some holes is draped over the trunk, making a triangular tunnel. Its edges are held down with sandstones. Sticks and leaves are woven together at one end for a makeshift wall. The other end is left open for now. He hopes to find another tarp or blanket to use as a door eventually. 



Denver stirs up the coals in his fire pit and revives the flame with some fresh tender of dead leaves. He adds wood scavenged from fallen tree limbs. He cuts them to size with the dull axe he found discarded by the road some months back. 



Over the fire, he cooks a single squirrel leg. As a side, he eats potato chips he stole from the gas station in town.  He drinks water from an old milk jug. He eats his meal without fuss or thought and crawls back into his blue fortress. 



Inside, he pulls a small tin from under his blanket. The tin holds bits of newspaper and single pages from books. He reads his favorite, a single leaf from Animal Farm, by the light of a bic lighter. He remembers most of the story from his time in eighth grade. His parents were just divorced when his class started reading the book. Mr. Thompson had made a big deal about the book being an observation on the corruptibility of man. Denver never really got all that. He just liked Boxer, the horse who gets sent off to the glue factory when he becomes of no use to the pigs. 



With the flame from the lighter extinguished, Denver settles down on his cot of leaves and covers himself with his only blanket. He lays the rifle at his side and falls asleep with his hand on the stock. His mind fuller than his belly.

*I saw him go across our backyard one day with this big ole poke over his shoulder. He was singin' something, or humming- mighta been a whistlin'. Anyway, he was carrying this big ole poke over his shoulder. I got to lookin and realized it was sittin’ funny. Like it was too heavy. It wasn't full, but what was in it was heavy. Kinda pulled it all tight towards the bottom. Anyway, he was a movin' pretty good, but labored in his steps. One point I saw him set ‘er down for a spell and catch his breath. He stopped out there by my ole flood light. Just barely in the light of it anyway. I told Cindy to get the phone handy, just in case we needed to dial for the sheriff. He sat out there for a while. Just looking around, catching his breath. He stared at my shed for a long time. Like he was thinking about doing something with it. I reckon he rested up enough cause he stood up to leave, picked up that sack, but it broke when he hauled it up on his shoulder. Couldn’t make out what was falling out of it from the window, but he sure scrambled to try and get it put back in. Something big. Seemed like he had a hard time fixing it and handling it all loose like that. He set the bag down again and started walking up to the back door. He knocked. I looked at Cindy. She shook her head no. I figured he wasn’t gonna leave, so I answered the door, but I only cracked it. He asked if he could bum a trash bag off us. I said yeah and had Cindy fetch one from the kitchen. After I gave it to him, he went back and moved his load into the new bag, stuffed the old one in it, and carried on. I never called anyone at the time because I wasn't sure what was in the bag. Seeing what I know now, I wished I had. I reckon I know what he was packing then.* 



Behind the laundromat, Denver warms his hands by the exhaust vent for the dryers. He remembers when he made his camp here a year ago and was promptly run off by the owner and two cops. They didn’t like him sleeping there, but didn’t seem to mind the occasional visit around back. 



Two boys approach, both in their early twenties. One of them is carrying a fast food bag, the other a phone, obviously ready to record. The boy with the bag approaches Denver. 

B: Hey, man. Whatcha doin' out here?



Denver doesn’t answer. He stares at the boys, confused. The lead boy tries again. 



B: So like, what’s your story, man?



Denver is again silent. 



B: Hey guys, we are here with our friend Greg- can I call you Greg?

D: What is this?

B: So Greg has been living on the streets for years, man. He’s out here just trying to survive, and nobody seems to give a rip. But you know what? Today is your lucky day, Greg.

D: My name's Denver.

B: Bro, what? Why didn’t you say that when I asked? Hey Tim, cut and start over, we gotta do it again.

T: Bruh… whatever. 



The boy starts his routine over, this time putting his arm around Denver, much to his discomfort. 



B: Alright, so check it out guys. We are out here with Denver. Bro has been living on the streets for like-

D: I don’t live on the streets. 

B: You do if you want this food, Bum. Tim, cut that part. Anyway, Denver has been living on the street for like a long time. Nobody seems to give a rip about him, but today is his lucky day. I got some food for ya, Den. Couple of burgers and some fries. We even got you some soda to wash it down with. But before I give this to ya, let’s hear about your story, man. 



Denver looks at the bag of food. The smell of the lukewarm contents drifts passively into his nostrils. The emptiness of his belly snarls at his resistant pride. 



D: Whatcha wanna know?

B: Well, let’s start with how you got here. What happened?



Denver thinks of something good to say.



D: I’m a veteran.

B: Bro, really? That’s crazy. Guys, how can we treat our heroes this way? Sad, man, for real. Where did you fight?

D: I was in Desert Storm. 

B: Man, thank you for your service. What happened when you came back?

D: I uh… my landlord split, and I didn’t have a place to stay. 

B: What about your mental health, bro? You come back with PTSD or somthin'?

D: Uh, yeah. I watched a friend of mine get blown off from the waste down.

B: Bro, no way.

D: Yeah, it was bad.

B: So, how long you been using?

D: What?

B: You know, how long you been on drugs, man?

D: I’m not on drugs.

B: Yeah, you ain't no vet neither, but you told that one real straight. 



Denver snatches the bag from the boy and furrows his brow. He does his best to be intimidating, but the boy laughs. He and his friend round the corner of the laundromat. Denver opens the bag. It’s the biggest meal he has seen in months. 

  
  


Back at home under the protection of his tarp, Denver takes his pocket knife and splits the burgers into rations for four meals, rewrapping each portion in paper. The fries he eats for today’s meal. 



Denver chews slowly on his fries, thinking about the real story of his past. The note he penned. He wondered if they ever read it. He looks at the rifle at his side. He takes out his page from Animal Farm and finds the name Boxer on it. Producing his pocket knife, he carves the letters carefully into the wooden stock of the gun. He examines his work, running his finger over each letter. Turning over, he settles down for sleep. He puts the rifle at his side, rests his hand on the stock, and closes his eyes. While he awaits sleep, his thumb moves back and forth over the newly carved name. He whispers it to himself. 



D: Boxer.

*There was a family moved down the road here a few months back. They moved since all this, probably because of them woods. When they moved in, I took 'em a pie as like a little housewarmin' present. When the woman opened the door, their dog shot out of there and started running round the front yard, yella lab, I think. We chit-chatted for a bit, but she noticed I kept lookin' at her dog. It kept sniffin' toward the tree line and looking in the woods. She assured me he was harmless. I said, “Yeah… just make sure he stays in the fence. Especially keep him out the woods.” She told me he wouldn’t hurt nobody, but I told her that wasn’t what I was worried about. We have pets go missin' around here all the time. Usually, it only happens with animals that go poking through the woods. She asked if it was coyotes. Told her we weren’t sure, but to keep her dog out of the woods if she wanted to keep it. She thanked me, and I went back over to the house. My Momma was visitin’ that day, so she was sittin’ at the table when I come in. She mentioned she saw that dog and asked if I told 'em about the woods. Said I did, but only as much as they needed. Momma just nodded and sipped her coffee. We don’t really know for sure what happens with them dogs and cats when they go missin', but we do know that there’s always smoke comin' up over the trees the next day or two. Well, that lab of theirs went explorin' the woods one day and didn’t come back. I saw her out there hollerin' for it, but there was already smoke going up. Dog was well fed. Saw smoke for a couple days.* 



Denver is awoken by the sound and feeling of his tarp being ripped down. He reaches for his rifle, but it isn’t there. His head whips around to a man in a flannel and overalls. He is holding a pistol and Denver’s rifle. Denver freezes, save for the rapid rising and falling of his chest. 



M: Whatcha doin' out here, boy?

D: I’m sorry. 

M: I ain't ask if you was sorry, I asked what you was doin'.

D: I just passing through. 



The man looks at the fire pit and scattered belongings. One thing he doesn’t see is a bag to carry it all. 



M: Don’t look much like passin’. 

D: I’m sorry.

M: You think you on government land or somethin'?

D: I wasn’t sure. 

M: Well, you ain't. You on my land. I don’t like trespassers, but I hate squatters more. 

D: I understand.

M: Gotta name?

D: Yessir. 

M: Say it.

D: Why?



The man steps to Denver, kneels, and puts a finger in his face. 



M: I find you livin' on my land, I ask whatever questions I want, and you answer. Name.



Denver hesitates.



M: Boxer?

D: Huh?

M: Your name, boy. It Boxer?



Denver glances at the rifle still in the man’s hand. The fresh carving of the letters stands starkly against the dark brown of the stock.  



D: Yessir. 

M: I figured as much. You get outta here 'for I call the sheriff. 

B: Yessir. Can I have my rifle?

M: Why? So you can’t shoot me?

B: No, sir. 

M: Then what?

B: So I can hunt.

M: You been huntin' on my land too?

B: No, sir. 

M: Where you been huntin’ then?

B: Other people’s land.



The man laughs into the air, the sound bounces off the quiet trunks of the forest and lands on Boxer’s ears. 



M: You got some nerve, boy. Tell ya what, Boxer. I’m gonna come up here same time tomorrow. You be gone, or I call the law. Anything you leave here is getting burned in that fire pit of yours. You get me?

B: Yessir. 



The man took the rifle and unloaded all the shells. He put them into his breast pocket on his overalls and handed the empty rifle back to Boxer. 



M: I’m gonna hang on to these. You gonna have to find some more to do your huntin with. 

B: Yessir.

M: Like I said, same time tomorrow. You and your stuff be gone. 

B: Yessir. 



The man turns and walks out of the dry creek bed. He crests the hill and disappears. Boxer looks about his home and begins to devise how he will move. He needs bags. 

  
  


In town, Boxer walks into a dollar store. The rifle shoved down his pant leg and covered by his t-shirt forces him to walk with a strange gait. He plays it as a limp. He is greeted with a nod from the cashier, who otherwise seems indifferent. He walks to the back and looks for trash bags. All the boxes seem too big to fit under his shirt. He elects to open up the box and grabs as many bags as he can stuff into his pants without making them appear too puffed. He adjusts their placement to ensure that none of the black plastic material can be spotted through any rips and holes in his jeans. 



He leaves the store with another nod from the indifferent cashier. He continues walking in his broken gait down the street to a hardware store. He walks to the back where the ammo and firearm counter is. He spots the 30-30 ammo in a locked case. An attendant approaches from behind. 



A: Somethin I can help you with, sir?

B: Uh, yeah. How much is that box of 30-30 ammo? 



The attendant goes behind the counter, unlocks the case and sets one box of the ammo down on the counter in front of Boxer.



A: Will be thirty dollars. 

B: Alright, I’ll take it. Do I pay for it up front?

A: Yessir. I’ll walk you up there. 

B: Walk me up there?

A: Yessir, we do it with all ammo sales. Some people try to run off with a box, put it under their shirt, or something.

B: That’s awful.

A: Yessir. Sad world we live in.

B: Well, I promise I won’t steal it.

A: Don’t have to promise nothin'. I’ll walk ya up. 



Boxer looks at the box and then around the store. He sighs heavy. 



B: Um, on second thought, I think I’ll have to come back some other time.

A: Why is that, sir?

B: Forgot my wallet.

A: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. We could put it on a tab for ya.

B: Yeah?

A: Yeah. You got one with us?

B: Um. I’m not sure.

A: What’s the name?

B: Thompson.

A: Thompson… Paul?

B: Yeah.



The attendant looked at him strangely.



A: Coulda swore Paul was an older feller. 

B: You’re thinking of my dad. I’m a junior.

A: Must be it. 

B: Yeah.

A: Well, I can put it on your tab. Just need some ID.

B: I told ya I don’t got my wallet. 

A: Oh, right. That’s a shame… Doesn’t look like I can do anything for ya, son. 



Boxer nods, defeated. He turns to walk away, and the attendant spots his awkward steps. 



A: What’s wrong with your leg?

B: It’s uh, an old injury. 

A: From what?



Boxer thinks for a moment. He sees the American flag pen on the man’s shirt.



B: Desert Storm.

A: Veteran?

B: Yeah. 

A: Well, here. 



The attendant holds out the box of ammo to Boxer. With some hesitation and feigned flattery, he takes the box. 



A: I’ll still walk you up, but to the door. I’ll cover it for ya. Just come back to us with your wallet next time. 

B: I really appreciate it, sir. 

A: Don’t mention it. 



The two walk to the front of the store, Boxer with his broken steps. The attendant opens the door for him. As he crosses the threshold, a security alarm buzzes. Boxer looks back, eyes wide.



A: Don’t you worry about that. It’ll go off in a second. You take care now. Come back and see us. 

B: Thank you. I will.

  
  


All of Denver’s belongings fit into one trash bag, even the tarp and extra bags. The bag is light, which is both a relief and a depressing reminder. He throws the bag over his shoulder. He looks around at the familiar scenery, much like one does when saying a reluctant goodbye. He sighs, turns, and walks deeper into the woods. 



For a while, he follows the old creekbed until he loses its shape in the leaves. He decides on a path with less brush and follows it. The deeper he goes, the denser the forest gets. Briers and thorns begin clinging to his tattered clothes. Some holes and tears in his jeans are torn further and expose more of his skin to the cold air setting in for the night. He eventually comes upon a small overhang. A large piece of limestone protrudes from the side of a hill, sheltering a small patch of ground. It’s just big enough for him to crawl into to lay down.  



He wraps himself in his blanket and pulls the tarp over himself and his trash bag. He reaches into the bag to check and make sure his tin of papers is still there. It is. He cradles the rifle in his arms and falls asleep.



Some hours later in the dark, Boxer is awoken by the sound of leaves crunching. He lies frozen. His eyes are wide open, though he cannot see anything. He hears the steps come close to his makeshift camp and stop. He hears nothing for what feels like several minutes. Then, he hears the slow, heavy steps walk up and over the hill above his limestone ceiling. 



Eventually, sleep takes Denver, and he hears nothing else the rest of the night. 

  


IV



*We were called to what is usually a pretty routine situation. Couple of kids out backroadin on a gravel road ended up hittin a tree. Ole Terry Caldwell put the call in that got us down there. When we got to the scene, the car was still runnin' headlights on. I went up to the passenger side and saw the girl. She was awake, but banged up a bit. Nothin' too bad, but roughed up well enough. She was sorta dazed, had obviously been knocked out for a bit. Smelled like liquor in the car. I asked her if she was alright. She just said her head hurt. I had already called in a 10-52, so I told her there would be help soon. I shined my light over to the driver’s seat. It was empty. My first thought was that the driver was thrown. I asked her who was drivin'. She said her boyfriend. Ambulance came, and another unit came in so I started looking for the boy. I checked the road, the woods, the rest of the car. Nothing. I had Benton help me look again. We checked everywhere we could think. Never found the boy. I went back to the car to check the driver’s seat. Tried to find a wallet, ID, anything to help. That’s when I noticed something funny. The seatbelt had been cut. The buckle had been latched, but the actual strap had been cut. We checked that area several more times over the next couple days. Did it in good light with more help. Only thing we ever found was a shoe that the family said looked like his. To this day, I don’t know what happened to that boy. The only thing the girl could remember from the accident was the driver screaming and swerving to miss something. She never got a good look at what he saw.* 



Denver makes his way through the woods for several more days. Each night he settles down for rest, he braces himself for another encounter with whatever had made those steps before. He sleeps fitfully, often waking up to just listen. He always clutches the rifle for comfort and protection. He always expects to hear the steps again. They never come. 



He opens his trash bag. He digs through to find the brown sack he used to store the rationed burgers. He finds nothing except a single fry, small and soggy. He eats this parcel for breakfast before packing up to move yet again. He could make a home here or any other place he had slept the last few days, but the feeling of being watched lingers here. A Home cannot be made in the presence of such disquietness. 



Denver treks through hill and holler for most of the cold day. The need for a coat is begging to make itself impossible to put off any longer. It begins to snow as he tries to crest the tallest hill of this day’s travels. When he does, he spots his gift lying peacefully below him, a deer. The doe is facing away from him, looking to the hill opposite. She does not see, smell, or hear him. Denver gently sets down the trash bag. The muscles in his arms are taught with restraint as he silently lowers it onto the dry leaves of the forest floor. 



Denver hoists his rifle to his eye and takes a rest against a tree in front of him. He tries to steady the bead on her when a stick breaks in the distance. He holds his breath as she stands alert. Even this proves to be in his favor as she is now standing broadside to his perch. Denver smiles weakly, draws aim just behind her foreleg, and fires.



The reassuring sound of lead meeting flesh confirms his kill, but she runs into the woods, beckoning him to follow. He leaves his bag where it lays and pursues her, rifle in hand. He finds her trail easily and follows it. She runs over two hills before he finds her, laying on her side, an arrow flagging her plainly, a man with a bow squatting over her. Denver approaches, not trying to conceal his presence. The hunter stands and turns to meet his gaze. 



H: Afternoon, sir.

D: Afternoon. 

H: You huntin these woods as well?

D: Yessir.

H: Where’s your orange? Suppossed to have orange if you’re huntin'. Dangerous not to. 

D: I don’t have any orange. 

H: Well, I got an extra vest if ya want it.

D: I don’t want no vest. I want my deer.

H: You trackin'? Where’s your trail? I’ll help you. 

D: Don’t need any help, that’s her there. 

H: This one? Nah, I shot her just a moment ago. Dropped her where she stood. She came runnin' over that hill-

D: Yeah.

H:-she stopped for a second, and I let fly-

D: She was running cause I shot her back that way.

H: You sure? I didn’t see no bullet wound on her.

D: I’m sure.

H: Well, let’s see. 



The hunter checks the deer as Denver watches. In a truly bizarre fashion, the Hunter had managed to send his arrow through the same hole Denver’s bullet had made.



H: Well, I’m sorry, sir, but I think this one’s mine. Only one hole, ya see.

D: That’s my deer. I tracked her here. I’m sure that’s the one I hit.

H: Well, I don’t see how that could be.

D: You shot her in the same spot I did.

H: Same spot?

D: Same spot.

H: Same hole?

D: Same hole.



The hunter eyes Denver strangely.



H: Well, that would really be somethin', huh?

D: You think I’m lyin'? 

H: Didn’t say that. 

D: You don’t believe me.

H: Well, can ya blame me? Seems hard to believe, doesn't it?

D: I tell ya, she’s mine. 



The hunter turns back to the deer, pulling something from his coat pocket. 



D: What are you doin'?

H: I’m taggin' my doe.

D: She ain't your doe.

H: I don’t know where your doe is, but this one here is mine. 



Boxer’s eyes furrow as the hunter prepares to tag and dress the animal. Boxer looks at the man’s bow, then down to the rifle at his side. Boxer levels the muzzle at the man’s body. He pulls the hammer back. The hunter freezes. He turns to Boxer.



B: I said, that’s my doe.

H: Now, son-

B: Stand up.

H: Okay.

B: Stand over there.

H: Yessir. 

B: You got a name?

H: Yessir. 

B: Say it.

H: Martin. Friends call me Mart.

B: Then I’ll call you Martin.

M: Yessir.

B: What food you got on ya?

M: Just some jerky.

B: Any water?

M: Got some tea in that jug. 

B: Get it.

M: The tea?

B: Both.

M: Yessir.



Martin slowly unzips his coat. Keeping on hand raised, he reaches into the interior pocket of his coat and pulls out a half-eaten bag of jerky. He tosses it over to Boxer and raises his hand back up with the other. 



B: Now the tea.

M: Yessir.



Martin slowly and deliberately walks to where he set his thermos down when he came to the deer. He keeps his body facing Boxer. Very cautiously, he stoops down and picks up the thermos. He walks slowly toward Boxer and hands it to him. Boxer keeps the rifle trained on Martin with one hand and takes the thermos with the other. 



B: You got a four-wheeler or somethin'?

M: Got a truck up that path aways. 

B: Get in the truck and leave. I’ll stay here and watch you.

M: Yessir.

B: Wait. Your coat.

M: My coat?

B: Yes, give it here.

M: Mister-

B: I said coat.



Martin unzipped his coat and threw it over to Boxer. 



B: Now turn around, get in that truck, and leave.

M: I need my keys. 

B: Okay?

M: They’re in my coat.

B: Get 'em.



Martin walked toward Boxer. He stooped down at the coat, rummaged in one of the pockets, and pulled out his keys. He held them up and walked backwards a couple steps. 



B: Now go. I’ll watch you leave. Don’t turn around. Don’t look at me, or I’ll shoot. 

M: Yessir.

B: Now get.



Martin does as instructed. Boxer does as he promised. He keeps the rifle aimed on Martin until he dissapears into the woods.



Denver stoops down and begins to dress the deer. Once finished, he drags it back over the hills and hollers to where his bag still lay, untouched. Denver decides to make camp here for the night and butcher some of the deer. What he doesn’t finish, he puts into one of the spare trash bags. He makes a fire and cooks himself some of the backstrap meat. It’s tender in his mouth, and he eats his fill.

I cannot remember if it was a TV show, a movie, or just an animation project. I did watch it somewhere online.

What I remember:

The setting is the American West and relatively modern times. The protagonists are a boy/girl duo. The girl has the big sister personality type, though I don't think the two of them are related. The girl's mother owns a diner where the girl worked. The mother has a coffee set that she's been hunting for the last piece of, the creamer dish. It's a recurring joke for characters to refer to the creamer as ""quite rare."" The boy gets into shenanigans that the girl gets dragged into.

I also think I remember a junk yard being another plot setting.

In some way, small portals being opened were a part of the story as the characters worked to understand how to control the portals.

I cannot remember anything else, but I reference the ""quite rare"" joke often, so I'd like to figure out what it is I'm quoting.",1,1765987567.0,tipofmytongue,1,1.0,False

So Mac and I have a LOT of mutuals. He reached out to me once and I kinda didn't talk to him until after 3 months later because I saw some of his work and some of my friends had mentioned him. I ask him to grab coffee because I thought he could help me with some creative projects I had and he starts pursuing me, we did have a lot of things in common and very compatible. Fast forward to us seeing each-other for a couple weeks I tell him im only interested in long term dating. He says he wants to take his time but he sees us in a relationship. I was ok with waiting some more but I was getting iffy because he was the one who initially pursued me, I kinda didn't like him that much. I eventually get close to his 3 best friends and one random day one of them tells me they want to talk to me about Mac. We can call her Lia, she tells me that Mac had a history of being an fboy and dating multiple people at the same time and not telling them. I was surprised she would tell me this as they have been friends for years but she said they were all frustrated with Mac's behavior and I was the only person that seemed to be mature and he would listen to. I talk to Mac about this and he tells me about his history, he actually was dating 6-8 people at the same time without telling any of them and leading them all on. He said he hadn't seen anyone while he started seeing me because he actually had feelings for me and was begging me to help him and stay in his life. I told him I wouldn't see him romantically anymore and we agreed to be friends. Mac suddenly started being nicer to me, doing romantic gestures, inviting me out etc. I was very confused by this because he had said he didn't think he could be in a relationship. Fast forward a couple days and his friend Lia calls me randomly and tells me that Mac had been facetiming this other person the whole time he was seeing me (2 ish months). I am angry and so I call him and we agree to talk, he tells me he did lie to me because he was scared of what was going to happen and so I call him out, because not only did he betray his best friends and me but he betrayed his work partner (me).

I ask him why he would continue seeing me even though I explicitly told him what I was looking for and he keeps saying he cares about me and can't lose me. Also for some reason he kept asking me what my feelings toward him were. I never really had strong feelings for him (compared to him) but this was just a waste of my time. I talked to his friends and a lot of us concluded that he might not be aware of his manipulation (or maybe he is idk) and someone told me that he was probably trying to get me to fall in love with him for his own validation (which is what he did with the previous people). And I did realize he started trying harder when I told him I had no feelings for him. I wasn't really affected by his manipulation because I have a degree in psychology and Mac and I are very similar so I saw right through him.

  
I guess I just want to say that sometimes people can manipulate in very small ways to try to get with you and if even their friends are warning you about their behavior I think its best to not continue pursuing them. I find it funny how at the end, Mac had the audacity to ask whether I would be ok with him seeing other people and bringing them to our work events. I honestly think this man has ISSUES.

  
**TL;DR:** I briefly dated a guy who pursued me, claimed he wanted a relationship, then lied about seeing other people while subtly manipulating me for validation—something even his own friends warned me about.

I have that shit pretty onlock right now.

Been keeping my groceries really stacked and it makes all the difference. Haven’t ordered door dash in like a week or more. And I bought popoeyes as a treat after a terrible therapy that session. Not just that, door dash hasn’t been replaced by eating at restaurants either.

Some big big changes:

1. I love milk so there’s always milk in my fridge.

2. Bought some frozen microwave meals as a last resort if needed.

3. Always have cooked rice and pasta available since it gives me a few eating options.

4. Yesterday I made a big salad for lunch. Not a salad kit. An actual fucking salad. Lettuce, Arugala, ranch, croutons, grilled chicken and feta. Not from a restaurant or a packet. I made that.

5. This weekend my roommate and I made some steak dinner and split ingredient costs. Steak was amazing (made by him). I handled the mashed potatoes and creamed cauliflower. I made a bunch of mashed potatoes and have a lot of left overs for later. Will be using that to make patties, some stuffed greenpeppers or just having it as is. Plannjng to do a “potatoes three ways” dinner tomorrow night for me and his girlfriend when she comes over tomorrow. (Roommate on a low carb diet so he can’t have it).

6. Recently made a smoothie with ice cream, yogurt and bananas that I’m really liking.

7. Snacky? There’s fig preserves in the fridge. Use it. Made some toast and smeared that bad boy on.

8. Was hungry and craving fried rice. So just made a couple of portions cause I had eggs and soy sauce anyhow.

9. I have celery and carrots. So I can snack on celery/carrots plus ranch whenever I need it.

10. Quick food? Just microwave pasta with some store bought Marinara.

11. Fruits? There’s a dozen apples and I’ve been eating them.

12. Salt cravings? Bought a bunch of pickle spears at Trader Joes. Also have a bag of chips if needed.

13. Sweet cravings? There’s a bunch of Reeses cups around.

14. I have tortillas and refried beans if I am in the mood for burritos. Still have salsa from earlier and a bunch of hot sauces in my fridge.

15. Bought some tinned campbell’s soups/chilis that I can have with rice.

16. On the move? Carry two protein bars. Make coffee. Fill it up with milk. That’s food.

Im realizing that instead of thinking of food as “I specifically want this one exact thing that I will doordash” instead I can stock my fridge up with options. And there will always be something close to what I’m craving.

I’ve also reorganized my fridge and pantry. So now, I know where everything I need is. With glance value. I had my roommate quiz me and I was able to point out all my food options in a heartbeat.

Im hungry now and am on the clock. So I’ll probably make a dense smoothie and drink it while working.

1pp0ayw,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1pp0ayw/my_wifes_expectations_im_never_good_enough/,My Wife's Expectations. I'm Never Good Enough.,"I'm really struggling currently and I don't necessarily know how to handle it.

My wife and I have 3 kids under the age of four, two of which are twins. I feel I can never meet my wife's expectations and everything I do (or am doing) is either wrong or ""not good enough"".

I have been trying very hard to take as heavy a load as I can. Four mornings out of the week I am handling the entire morning routine; I get all the kids up, dressed for daycare, give them breakfast, make their lunches and snacks for the day and do the drop-offs .. then I grab a cup of coffee, come home and start my workday by either going to the office or working from home.

I pick up the kids 3 days out of the 5 during the week, trying to be flexible with my wife's work routine if she needs to stay late or get stuff done in the office. Two of those days we have nanny's for help, but I'll make sure the kids are set-up for dinner, etc.

I try to stay on top of other household stuff as best as I can, but truthfully sometimes I miss things ... because I'm  human and have a lot going on ... but I try. 

If I see dishes in the sink, I try to do make sure they get done. I try to stay on top of doing the cat litter daily, taking out the garbage daily, decluttering as much as I can. Sometimes those things get missed, because I'm human, but if they do it IMMEDIATELY gets brought up to me about how I'm dropping the ball.

I'm doing all of this while running my own business and dealing with my own shit.

I feel like none of what i do is ever good enough. I'm told I'm ""constantly disappointing"".

If I put away laundry I might be told I ""didn't sort things the right way"" ... yet if I leave it for her to do, I'm ""expecting her to do it"".

Sometimes the lunches I pack for the kids ""aren't right"", because they don't have the exact things she would want in them; yet if I ask what she wants me to pack for lunch, I'm ""putting it on her mental plate"".

I constantly get told I ""don't do as much as her"" because she ""carries the mental load"", yet if I ask her to tell me things to do to relieve that load I'm ""expecting her to give me instructions"" and ""managing me is another thing on her plate"".

If I bring up what I do around the house, to counter-act her telling me I don't contribute, I get told sarcastically ""Oh so we should throw you a parade? Nobody throws a parade for me with all I do"".

God forbid I take time for myself, like to sit on the couch to watch a movie or go out with friends, I'm ""being lazy"" ... and to be clear she NEVER gives herself time to do that, even though I push her to.

I feel there's no winning here, outside of me somehow getting inside of her head and doing EXACTLY what she wants when she wants it.

I'm constantly told I'm not being ""pro-active"" to take care of things, but I'm not doing it intentionally ... I just don't notice the same things she does, and if I ask for her to point things out it's ""putting it on her"".

For example, I could have a few empty Amazon boxes on the kitchen counter for a week without it bugging me. It would just be background noise, it wouldn't bother me but eventually I'd take it out to the recycling ... yet something like that will be brought up to me, pointing out how I'm ""ignoring things"" and ""being lazy"".

It's not laziness, it's just not something that registers with me the same way.

Big deals to her are ""big deals"", and if I don't treat them with the same level of anxiety and immediacy that she feels I'm ""dismissive"" and ""don't care about things"".

Also - if I do proactively make decisions they get criticized. I proactively bought new spatulas and kitchen shears last month because ours were breaking. I was critiqued because they ""weren't what she wanted"", yet if I went to her, asking her to let me know what to get, I'd be told I'm ""relying on her to tell me what to do again"".

I don't think I'm a terrible husband or a bad Father, but it's never good enough and I don't know what to do. It's beating me down emotionally and making me feel worthless.

Maybe I'm just venting, but it's beating the hell out of me at this point.",4,1765987414.0,daddit,7,0.83,False

   “The Vasilios Estate appeared in our atmosphere approximately thirty minutes after the Platinum Future sent their transmission,” they said. “We’ve attempted to hail it, but as of yet have had no response. Our scans indicate that something is happening with the reactor though.”

   “If there really is a weapon on board that ship, are we authorized to just shoot it down?” asked one of the men in her office, Captain Alan Paul. Paul was the head of security for Altumare. Hardly a decorated general, but the closest thing Altumare could get. He looked to Olivia for support. She seemed to hesitate.

   “You’re suggesting we just blow up the Vasilios Estate?” Olivia asked. “Do we even know who might be on it? We can’t afford to be reckless here. The last thing we need to do is to kill any member of the Vasilios family.”

   “The message from the Platinum Future indicated that the Estate had been detached without the authorization of the Vasilios family,” Paul said.

   “Which doesn’t mean none of them are on it! We need more information!” Olivia argued. She rubbed her temples.

She’d taken the position as the planetary administrator of Altumare was supposed to be easy. This frozen world wasn’t fit to be colonized, and with the presence of a God, it would likely be too dangerous anyways. But the vast freshwater ocean that spanned the planet beneath the ice was still a valuable resource. Vasilios had wanted the fish and the water to export to their colonies. All she was supposed to do was make sure the fishermen and the factories met their quotas, and all would be fine. She wasn’t equipped to deal with whatever the hell this was supposed to be.

   “With all due respect, Miss Patrick, there are over five thousand workers on this planet who could be at risk if we don’t act,” Paul warned. “We were told to disable the ship at any cost. This achieves that goal.”

Olivia shook her head.

   “Call them back,” she said to the technician. “We’re not blowing up the Vasilios Estate without a damn good reason!”

Paul’s brow furrowed. He opened his mouth to argue, when the Technicians Tac Band beeped with a notification. They looked down to check it.

   “A shuttle has been launched from the Vasilios Estate,” they said.

   “Destination?” Olivia asked. The technician sent off a quick message.

   “Going by the current trajectory… they’re heading out to the Temple of the Sea.”

Paul and Olivia traded a look.

   “The Temple?” Paul asked. “What the hell would be down there?”

   “It doesn’t matter. Scramble your men to intercept. I want them right on top of it the moment it lands. But don’t start shooting until we know who’s on it, but if they’re not a member of the Vasilios family, you have my permission to engage.”

Paul gave a nod and quickly departed. Olivia looked back at the technician.

   “Keep all facilities and outposts on high alert until this is dealt with. Keep an open line with the Platinum Future. Send all communications directly to my office.”

The Technician nodded and quietly left. Olivia sighed as soon as they were gone.

Whatever was going on here, she hadn’t signed up for this.



\*\*\*



The frozen tundra of Altumare stretched on forever. Snow danced in the wind. The storm was not as severe out here. It was almost peaceful.

The shuttle descended from the cloudy skies, coming in for a landing near the mouth of a massive cavern. In the cockpit, Jean Devereaux stared out at it. She felt a quiet anxiety in her chest.

She had been waiting for this moment for so long… she hadn’t expected to be the one standing there at the mouth of the cavern to finish the work, but in a way she was almost glad she was. This had been her endeavor. It was only right that she would be the one to finish it.

She stepped out of the cockpit of the shuttle. The private shuttles of the Vasilios family were far more luxurious than Victor’s had been and were outfitted with all sorts of other luxuries. A small bar, plush cots to sleep in and various personal armaments for their private security.

Jean went straight for the bar and poured herself a drink. Whisky on ice. She swallowed it down and exhaled before closing her eyes.

Almost done. She was almost done…

She reached into her pocket, taking out a set of rings. Eight in total.

One by one she slipped them onto her fingers. She tightened the Tac Band around her wrist. She could feel Freya’s droneblade on her belt, ready to finish its work.

Her work.

   “*You know, I could end it all, if I wanted to…” Estrella had said.*

*She and Jean had been seated in the kitchen of the Vasilios Estate at the time, talking over coffee. She’d kept inviting her over and Jean hadn’t been entirely sure why. Perhaps it was because she seemed like a friendly face? She knew how to put on a winning smile for her customers and of course she’d been more than happy to do the same for Estrella. Being on good terms with the Chairwoman of the Vasilios Corporation was good for business… although that woman seemed to see their relationship as more than just professional. Jean hadn’t been entirely sure how she’d felt about that.*

*Estrella seemed pleasant enough… melancholy, which was understandable given her circumstances, but never more than a client. Nevertheless, she’d indulged her. Why not? What harm could come from it?*

   “*I could end it all tomorrow…” Estrella had said. Jean had paused, looking up from her coffee.*

   “*Don’t go thinking like that,” She’d replied. “I get it. It’s rough right now. But give it time. Things will get better.”*

   “*Will they?” Estrella asked. “I’ve got nothing, Jean. My children are gone… all that’s left is a copy. And Maria… she… the things she said. Talking about the way the Galaxy suffers. The soullessness of it all. The meaninglessness. I can’t stop thinking about it. Its all I can see now. I brought it up with the board but… they won’t listen to me. They don’t care. Why should they, I suppose? We’re the ones at the top of the system, what does it matter what becomes of everyone else?”*

*Jean’s eyes had narrowed as Estrella spoke.*

   “*How’s that make you feel?” She asked.*

   “*Sick... have I really been living in blissful ignorance all this time? Ignoring it because it’s convenient…”*

   “*You say that like you already know the answer,” Jean said, a hint of accusation in her voice. Estrella had paused. She was silent for a few moments, before looking up at Jean.*

   “*You… you grew up out there, right? Is it really that bad?” She almost sounded like she was pleading for her to say no. She almost did.*

   “*It can be worse, actually,” She’d said. “Worse than you can possibly imagine. But that’s life, I suppose.”*

*Estrella went silent. A look flickered in her eyes. Horror. True, genuine horror.*

   “*It shouldn’t be…” She said quietly.*

   “*It is. That’s just the state of the galaxy we live in,” Jean shrugged. “If it’s any consolation, it’s not just Vasilios that’s the problem. The whole system is broken. From everything I’ve read it’s been that way since before the old world collapsed. History paints a picture all too similar to the one we see now. Goliaths on the backs of laymen gnawing at each others throats. And look how it ended for them? When the Earth fell, the Corporations just filled the void left behind by the old Governments. All of this? It’s just human nature. It's cyclical. It repeats. How do you figure it will end this time?”*

   “*That’s… that’s quite a cynical perspective,” Estrella said, a little uneasy. Jean paused, realizing she may have said too much.*

   “*But I suppose I can’t deny your logic…” The Chairwoman continued. “From what I’ve read about Earth, their systems weren't actually much better.”*

   “*Well if they were, then the planet would still be habitable,” Jean replied.*

*Estrella had nodded, a faraway look in her eyes.*

   “*Maybe I should end it all…” She said. Jean raised an eyebrow.*

   “*I don’t think suicide would be-”*

   “*Not suicide… everything,” Estrella said. “I remember that one of our science teams was working on a wormhole project. Nothing that productive, but they had supposedly torn a hole in reality itself. I remember that during the briefing, Dr. Campbell mentioned that left uncontrolled, such a tear could wipe everything out. Just... rip it all apart... maybe that’s what we deserve?”*

*A memory crossed Jean’s mind. A wormhole project… she’d seen something similar, a long time ago. She stared down at her coffee, pensive, thinking about screams in the darkness from years past. She looked up at Estrella, lost in her own thoughts. Looking into her eyes, she knew that what the Chairwoman was saying was little more than a dark passing though. This was a woman in pain and pain could send the mind to some dark places. Jean knew that. She doubted Estrella would actually have it in her to do what she’d just suggested.*

*But perhaps it still needed to be done… perhaps it was necessary. The thought had crossed her mind before. Just an idle thought. But to induce it... to make it happen... she'd never considered the possibility before.*

   “*It is what we deserve,” She finally said. Estrella had looked over at her. “I mean… think about it. We’re far past salvation, aren’t we? I’d argue it’s a more merciful ending. Just have the Universe suddenly end. No more pain… ever again.”*

*She saw a look in Estrella’s eyes. She knew exactly what she was thinking about.*

   “*We could think of it as a gentle euthanasia…”Jean said. “I mean… that’s what it is, isn’t it?”*

   “*Yes…” Estrella said quietly. “Yes, it would be…”*



*\*\*\**



   “***Alert Miss Devereaux. There is an incoming hail from Altumare Planetary Security,”*** chirped the drone on her shuttle.

Jean looked up, distracted from her thoughts for a moment.

   “We can go ahead and ignore that, Samara,” She replied.

  “***Hail declined. Warning, Vasilios Security ships inbound.”***

She chuckled to herself. She wasn’t surprised. She’d expected them to come for her. She poured herself another shot, downed it quickly then rolled her neck. Then she opened the shuttle door, and stepped out into the snow.

The ships were coming fast. Jean counted three of them. Two dropships escorted by three fighters. Not much of a welcome wagon… but Altumare wasn’t exactly a high priority target for the other Corporations. Aside from the Goddess, the only thing here was water and fish.

She stood in the snow, staring up at the oncoming ships. She undid her coat, before making a subtle upward gesture with her hands, rolling her wrists toward her body. Eight plasma cutter drones rose from her coat. She splayed her fingers and the blades came to life.

She raised her left hand, outstretching three fingers toward the oncoming ships. Three of her cutter drones took off, flying toward the advancing force. She focused on the escorting fighters first, letting her plasma cutters soar toward their wings. They raked across them, cutting through them like little more than wet paper, ripping one wing apiece away from each fighter.

The fighters lost control. Down a wing, none of them could remain in the air and Jean watched as they spiraled down into the ice. Watching their escort go down, the dropships tried to evade. Jean curled in her extended fingers to recall her loosed cutter drones, but the dropships were too fast for them.

No matter. Jean ran her thumb along the bottom of the rings on the index and middle fingers of her right hand. She felt the center parts of the rings rotate, until she felt a familiar click. Two of her cutter drones blades extinguished as they shifted into their assault mode. She made a makeshift pistol with her fingers, aiming her index and middle finger at one of the dropships. Then she mimed shooting.

At her command, two of the cutter drones hovering at her side fired a concentrated beam, clipping one of the dropships. It rocked violently in the air, before one of its engines caught fire. It swayed unevenly, struggling not to crash. The two plasma cutters that had just fired went out, smoke rising from their emitters.

The second dropship soared past its crashing sister. Jean watched it for a moment, before making a sweeping gesture with both hands, sending her remaining three cutter drones after it. As the dropship closed in, the three plasma cutters intercepted it. One tore through the cockpit. The other two clipped the engines. The dropship swerved violently before crashing into the ice, just a few hundred feet away from Jean.

With a gesture, she recalled all of her wayward blades back to her. From the corner of her eye, she saw her drone emerge from her shuttle.

   “*Miss Devereaux, are you alright? Is your weapons system in need of repairs?”*

   “It’s fine, Samara,” Jean said. “Stand by.”

   “*Understood. Please be advised that I have detected an abrupt shift in the weather patterns. I believe there is a storm coming - a very severe one. Please return to the shuttle as soon as possible.”*

   “In a moment,” Jean said. “Let’s deal with the stragglers first.”  
The two plasma cutters that had been fired reignited, and with a quiet sense of purpose, Jean advanced toward the fallen ships to deal with the survivors. With her thumb, she set the rings on both of her little and ring fingers into defense mode, and at her request, four of her cutter drones began to circle around her.



\*\*\*



It had all happened so fast. One moment they’d been approaching the shuttle, the next the fighters had gone down. His dropship had been next, and the other dropship had followed moments later. He wasn’t even entirely sure what had hit them… only that whatever it was, it’d hit them hard.

They’d been lucky. There’d been no casualties in their crash. The other dropship hadn’t been so fortunate. He could hear the chatter over his Tac Band. Frantic. Scared.

   “*Pilot is down. I repeat, Pilot is KIA!”*

   “*We have wounded on board!”*

   “*Captain! Hostile approaching! Requesting immediate support!”*

He could already hear the gunfire… he could already hear the screams. Paul looked up at the other 9 men aboard his crashed dropship. His heart was racing faster than it ever had.

   “Move out!” He ordered, shambling over to the rear of the dropship to open the doors. His men obeyed without question and followed him out into the cold.

He could see the other crashed dropship just up ahead. He could see the flashes of gunfire as men tried to get a shot off on the figure moving around them, several levitating plasma cutter drones orbiting them at nearly blinding speed to prevent anyone from getting close. Four additional plasma cutters hovered around her, responding to every little gesture of her hands and ripping the survivors limb from limb.

Paul could smell burning flesh. He saw one of his men trying to get to cover, but the platinum blonde woman at the center of the storm of plasma cutters spied him from the corner of her eye. With a flick of her wrist, she sent one of her cutter drones after him. He barely had time to react. Before he could even open his mouth to scream, most of his head was severed cleanly from his body. She’d cut just above his jaw, leaving the lower jaw hanging there, as the rest of his skull hit the ground, followed by the rest of him.

Paul froze up as the woman’s eyes shifted to him and his men. Two of the plasma cutters that had been defensively encircling the woman broke off and were launched at his men. One of them fell immediately as his head was struck from his body. The others tried to flee, but the woman seemed to have been expecting that. She raised her hands, forming her fingers into pistols. Two of her cutter drones responded immediately, their blades extinguishing as they took aim at his men. Then they fired, bathing Paul’s men in flame, melting the flesh from their bones. The woman moved quickly, racing for cover behind the fallen dropship as some of his men tried to return fire. Though she was in cover, her cutter drones remained out in the open and launched themselves at his men.

They never stood a chance.

Paul had fallen behind, watching in quiet horror as his men were slaughtered. He didn’t know what to do… he didn’t know what he*could*do as his paltry fighting force was dismantled. The cutter drones tore through their bodies like butter, and in mere moments the twenty men he had brought with him were little more than scattered limbs in the snow. Paul had stopped. He was frozen, breathing heavily… terrified.

The woman stepped out from behind the crashed dropship, her gait slow, calm, almost detached. She stared down at her handiwork before looking over at Paul, who stood rooted to the spot, helpless and afraid. He tired to raise his gun, but one of the cutter drones tore through it before he could even squeeze the trigger.

The woman approached him, slowly, deliberately. The eight cutter drones hovered around her. Paul watched them, a growing dread in his guts.

   “W-who the fuck are you?” he asked weakly.

   “Just a concerned citizen,” The woman replied dismissively. “You’re the commander, right? You look like it. Do you have backup incoming?”

Paul struggled to answer. There wasn’t much backup to call! Altumare didn’t have that big of a security force. It didn’t need one! There were only about ten fighters on the planet and he’d sent the rest of them to investigate the Vasilios Estate. Of the less than eighty men under his command, he’d taken every available one to investigate the shuttle. There was no backup! There was no calvary!

   “An army…” Paul lied. “I…I don’t know what you sought to accomplish by coming here, but you won’t get it!”

She studied him for a moment before chuckling.

   “An army, huh?” She asked. “You’re a terrible liar.”

Paul gritted his teeth. He went for the pistol in his belt. He already knew how it was going to end, but he refused to die a coward.

   “Whatever the hell you’re here for, I’ll die before I let you-”

His voice suddenly died in his throat. With just a simple gesture of her finger, one of the woman's plasma cutter drones tore through him, cutting up from between his legs, to the top of his head in one broad stroke. There was no pain. Paul felt nothing.

   “Sold,” She said. Paul’s legs buckled under him as he collapsed into the snow… both halves of him.

The woman stared down at his corpse, smoke rising from his charred bisected remains. Then she turned and walked away, back towards the cavern. Around her, the wind howled as the storm grew more intense, before all disappeared beneath a haze of white.",1,1765987344.0,HeadOfSpectre,0,1.0,False

Chapter One of the novel (Detective Rose Anthony),"In early January 1940, New York City was drowned in a nocturnal calm and stillness that seemed to carry beautiful dreams. Suddenly, this silence was shattered by an urgent call to the police station. The voice coming over the phone was tense, breathless, and sharply brief:
​Unknown Caller: ""Hello... Police?!""
Police: ""Yes, what happened?""
Unknown Caller: ""Count Arison Dusty has been killed... The address is on Washington Street. Please hurry.""
​Before the officer could ask for details, the line suddenly cut off with a cold dial tone.
​Police Officer (stunned): ""Wait... who is this?! Damn... he hung up!""
Other Officer (pulling on his coat): ""Let’s go, men, we have a mission.""
​By Wednesday morning, newspapers had filled the sidewalks with a shocking headline: ""Count Arison Commits Suicide in His Room!"" The news seemed illogical to everyone who knew him; the Count was full of joy and a love for life, with no dark tendencies.
​The news reached Britain, capturing the attention of one of its most prominent detectives, Frederick Dunn. Frederick had been planning a quiet vacation in New York, but this summons turned the trip into an urgent mission. He sighed as he entered the New York Police Department, trying to process the loss of his dream vacation. He approached a man busy taking notes:
​Detective Frederick: ""Hello... are you the head of the department? Or the person who received the anonymous call?""
Officer: ""No, I’m not the chief. And who are you?""
Frederick: ""Oh... excuse me. I should have introduced myself first. My name is Frederick Dunn, the British detective.""
Officer (impressed): ""The promising detective from Britain! And what brings you here, Mr. Frederick?""
Frederick (with a sigh): ""I was planning a vacation... but, since the Count is of British origin and was spending his holiday here, it was my right to intervene. This is recognized by the British police, isn’t it?""
Officer (laughing): ""Yes, that’s right... the Chief is in the bathroom, suffering from... a sudden health condition.""
​As laughter slipped between them, an assistant stepped in from behind them and spoke in a low voice:
Assistant: ""Maybe we should ask the private investigator for help... she would solve the case quickly.""
Officer: ""Enough! If the Chief heard you, you might be accused of the Count's murder!""
Frederick (curiously): ""And who is this investigator?""
Officer: ""Rose Anthony. A bit crazy, young, but she respects no one... and I advise you not to underestimate her.""
​In the Den of Detective Rose
​Frederick headed curiously to ""Fifth Avenue,"" where Rose's headquarters was located. He knocked on the door, and was met by a young woman with messy red hair and dark eyes clouded by exhaustion.
​Rose: ""Who are you? If you aren't here for something useful, leave now. I don't have time to play with the British.""
Frederick (surprised): ""How did you know I was British?""
​She slammed the door in his face, but he knocked again loudly and shouted:
Frederick: ""Wait! I have a case for you!""
​Rose opened the door again, with a wide and sudden smile:
Rose: ""Finally, fate wanted me to suffer a little!""
​Frederick entered her chaotic office, where a black cat sat yawning lazily. She handed him a cup of cold coffee and sat down, playing with her cat:
Rose: ""What is the case?""
Frederick: ""Count Arison committed suicide in a strange way in the reading room.. there are no signs of violence as the police claimed, but the room was locked and the windows too...""
​A short silence followed, then Rose stood up sharply and said: ""Let’s go, then!""
​The Crime Scene: The Scent of Wine and Suspicion
​When they arrived at the crime scene, Rose clashed with the police officers who hated her, especially the Chief who tried to kick her out, if not for Frederick’s presence which gave her legal cover.
​The room was suspiciously tidy, but Rose noticed something: a strong smell of wine in a certain spot, and glass scattered lightly, gleaming on the floor with difficulty. There were two glasses of drink, one with a faint trace of lipstick. As for the Count, he was leaning under the chair, his skin pale, with a quilt wrapped around his neck extending up to the chandelier.
​Rose approached the body, lifted the quilt from the neck, and furrowed her brows: there was no mark of the body's weight on the neck as usually happens in hangings. She lifted the victim's head, and suddenly a drop of blood fell on her dress. She turned the Count's head to discover a deep wound from the back; the trace of a blow with a solid object with glass remains stuck in it.
​Rose (in a decisive tone): ""Now.. this is a murder.""
​With Frederick’s authority, the police were forced to move. While the servants were calming the Count's collapsed wife, Rose sat on the floor in the room, rearranging thoughts in her mind (Internal Dialogue):
(This case is strange.. how is someone killed like this? All possibilities are weak.. even if he really hanged himself, the quilt wouldn't support his weight and would tear anyway. Secondly, where is the mark of weight on his neck? It’s not there. That blood.. someone hit him on the head.. how? Well... let’s see if there is any evidence in his desk).
​She stood up suddenly and said:
Rose: ""Frederick, go and get information from the Count's wife. Find out about his last work; perhaps we can understand something or catch a thread.""
Frederick: ""Alright.""
​Confrontation and Eliciting the Truth
​While the ""narcissistic"" wife tried to evade, Frederick tried gently:
Frederick: ""Please, Madam, tell me about the Count's last work. This will help us understand what happened to him, believe me!""
Count’s Wife: ""Why am I being interrogated? Do you suspect me? Huh?!!""
Frederick: ""It's just a routine procedure, Madam.""
Count’s Wife: ""I'm not interested, I won't say anything.""
​At that moment, Rose interrupted:
Rose: ""Are you really not going to say that your husband made a contract with an orphanage, huh?""
Count’s Wife (nervously): ""How did you know?""
Rose (panting with excitement): ""I found this picture under the desk.. Look, this is the logo of an orphanage here in this area. It's an old orphanage. And look at the Count standing lovingly with a lady other than you!""
Count’s Wife: ""Ha ha.. and do you think this proves there was a contract?""
Rose (with a provocative smile): ""Yes, right here.."" (Rose turned the picture over to reveal writing on the back): ""My dear Sally, soon I will buy the orphanage for you as you wanted, this is my dream as it is yours"".
​Wife (trembling): ""I.. I’m not...""
Frederick: ""So the wife is the killer!""
Rose: ""No.. it's not the wife.""
Frederick: ""Then who? And how is it not her?!""
Rose: ""From what I see, the wife is pregnant. Didn't you see how she walks with difficulty in this wide dress? For a wealthy lady, she wouldn't wear this and walk with such difficulty.. and given you are in your early forties, is this your first time pregnant?""
​The wife burst into tears, while Frederick asked in confusion:
Frederick: ""What does this have to do with that?""
Rose: ""Because the crime was a blow to the head with a solid object, which was the wine bottle. And from what we saw, there were two glasses of wine and both were drunk. There is a light trace of lipstick on the other glass. The killer is a woman, but not the late Count's wife; she is ruled out.""
Frederick: ""Then who? Is it Sally?""
Rose: ""Most likely.""
​Rose turned to the wife sharply: ""Madam, tell me, who was here last night?""
Count’s Wife: ""I don't know.. I had argued with my husband. I went to shower and he went back to the reading room. I remember hearing someone enter, but since I had argued with him, my pride prevented me from going back to the bedroom. I went and slept alone in the guest room.. it’s far from the reading room, don't forget the Count's house is large.""
Rose: ""So who knows about the unknown guest, Madam?""
Count’s Wife: ""It's the guard.""
​The Sudden Encounter
​The guard was trembling as he watched the police, when Rose suddenly popped up in front of him like a ghost:
Rose: ""Hey.. why are you so nervous?""
Guard (in shock): ""Who are you???""
Rose: ""Listen, I want to know about the guest who came at night, tell me!""
​Rose was persistent and the guard was drowning in his fear, when suddenly, a girl standing at the outer gate interrupted the scene and said calmly:
The Girl: ""Dear Norman, how are you?""
​Rose turned around and froze in shock; it was the woman in the picture! It was Sally. But the guard took a sigh of relief and said in a trembling voice:
Guard: ""Martha... you scared me!""",1,1765987301.0,KeepWriting,1,1.0,False

This drama is very much about the relationship building of the two main characters.  The story lines... his job/her dad... were just incidentals so WYL and ZXX can get from Point A to The End... and I'm perfectly fine with this.

She's a much better communicator than he is, but his job hamstrings him so he gets a pass. This makes her come across much more mature than him. He's conflicted and emotionally tortured.  There is more, but this is as far as I going into the deep end analysis of this drama and CShorts in general. \#ShallowEnd👸🏻 \#EntertainmentNotPsychoanalysis

Yes, there were resolutions to the various storylines but one point was kinda fluffed over with a very abrupt transition which makes me wonder if one episode was left out accidentally/on purpose. Wouldn't be the first or last time for these CShorts. \#SoIrritating.  It was probably the only blatant thing that threw me out.

There is no whizbang action as such, physical altercations are started on-screen but finished out-of-sight.

The few moments of smokin' hot passion were few and far between.  Really few.  Hot-bod flashes... not nearly enough but I'm reassured that he is still working out.

• 💕• 

The Deep-er Thoughts:  I previously [commented about WYL's detachment recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/s/DmxCOBep28) as perceived by moi. I feel that he was much more present in this drama... and I was more engaged as a viewer. This counts as a *win/win* in my book!

**My#1Boyfriend-Wang Yi Lei** has begun his \#RedemptionArc for this fan.  I hope it continues.  As long as he is not paired with a very, very select few actresses (as in two at the moment), he's back on solid ground with me.  And I'm a happy-er fan! 🥳

I dated in highschool but during my 20s I got really sick and pretty much spent the 20s in and out of hospitals for 10ish years. Dated in my 30s for about a year and some but my mental health was really on the low end and we parted ways because of it. 

I have had many jobs in my life and knew limitations from my health would cause work issues later on with life but recently my doctor told me with my illness that caused nerve damage in my limbs, stomach and issues with heart and kidneys that I would be better off on disability instead of working. 

It was a punch in the stomach because I want to work, I want to do activities but when you can't hold a coffee cup sometimes or a knife or screw driver or get floppy duck feet from walking (you can laugh at this because it's the only way I can explain it) I can see why work places pass on me.

I'm trying to put myself out there. I go to mental health and weekly appointments for my diabetes and health, lost weight and got out more as well try to do more for myself to ""self love""  but I think I will never be able to date because I am a person with disability and don't have a actual job. 

When I am talking with someone and ""work"" gets brought up and I am honest I get ghosted or I can see their look totally flip on the convo. I even tried to do provincial programs to start my own business but with how the price of things are I had to put it on the back burner.

Joe is a *very* extroverted person. They are always energetic and energized *(mostly due to them literally being coffee)*. They try to socialize with *as many* people as possible and this *mostly* annoys Mug because they're *way more* introverted than Joe. Joe is also often times a people pleaser.

She's super sweet (artificially so, I have to add,) but I feel like she takes things a little too personally sometimes. 

I invited her over the other day and suggested watching this new animated show on Breadflix, and she agreed, albeit a bit reluctantly. I didn't think much of it and put on the first episode. For context, the main character is a high school girl (human) and in the episode, she is running late on her first day.

My friend immediately became upset and told me she didn't want to continue watching. I was confused and asked what the problem was, and she explained how she didn't appreciate the way toast was depicted in the show. I didn't even pay much attention to it, so it took me a while to realise what she meant, but she explained that the way the main character carelessly ran with bread dangling from her mouth was offensive and disrespectful.

I pointed out that it was just a show, and not that deep, but she then got mad at ME and said that I was being ignorant and ""breadist,"" which isn't true, because I have plenty of bread friends of all kinds. She then asked how I felt about the way coffee was depicted in mainstream media, to which I said that it wasn't the same thing at all.

The mood was spoiled after the fact and she soon left without even saying a proper goodbye. I'm at a loss. She hasn't spoken to me in a few days and all our mutual friends have become distant. AITA?",5,1765987112.0,brekafats,1,1.0,False

He speaks up on mic and says he is friendly, just cold. He then asks me what the candleberries look like as he is trying to find some. As I am trying to be helpful and describe the new plant, he shoots me point blank with a ferro and pulls out his raider tool to finish me off. I reacted too late and he was just too close to me for me to get away. He laughs and asks ""what do they look like again?"" then finishes me off.

Once there, they needed to buy food, goods and supplies, which San Francisco’s merchants were all too willing to provide—for a cost. 

Stuck in a remote region, far from home, many prospectors coughed up most of their hard-earned money for the most basic supplies. At the height of the boom in 1849, prospectors could expect prices sure to cause sticker shock: A single egg could cost the equivalent of $25 in today’s money, coffee went for more than $100 per pound and replacing a pair of worn out boots could set you back more than $2,500.

Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

I’m suffering from postpartum depression, postpartum anxiety, postpartum rage, and ocd. I am getting help for it however but it’s still hard. I grew up in a house where I was always yelled at. Even if I spilled something on accident I was spanked with a belt and given the silent treatment. 

Now I’m a mom and I’m trying to break the cycle. I have never put my hands on my kids but I do find myself getting very angry and frustrated a lot. I try to not let my anger show but sometimes it does and it breaks my heart. Sometimes I feel like I’m just like my mom and I don’t ever want to be that. My two year old daughter is going through a very defiant stage, which I know is normal. It’s just been hard because I’m caring for a 4 month old baby while my daughter is constantly doing something to get my attention in a bad way, I know she’s just having a hard time with her new sibling. 

At around 7am morning, I was sitting on the couch, pumping, and feeding my baby a bottle. My daughter was watching her cartoons and I guessed she figured out I was busy and can’t really play with her at the moment. She obviously didn’t like that and started to throw stuff on the coffee table. I kinda ignored this behavior but I told her to stop after she almost knocked down my water bottle (my very last water until I could go to the grocery store later that day). She started to do spins and spun into my water bottle after I sat it back down on the table. It spilled everywhere. 

Man. The rage that I felt come over my body was insane. I looked at her and saw tears filling in her eyes because I think she genuinely felt bad (she’s a very intelligent girl) and I think she kinda feared me which broke my heart. Suddenly my brain told me “she’s just a child, she didn’t mean to” and I instantly calmed down and told her “it’s okay baby, it was an accident, mommy loves you” and she calmed down immediately and gave me a hug. She’s not really an affectionate girl so that meant a lot to me.

All the rage and anger melted away when I saw that look in her eyes. I wanted to yell so bad because I no longer had water for that morning, but instead I calmed down because I saw me in her at that moment.

I know he’s a homies type of guy and I always wonder if he’s annoyed that I’m a girl in the way because he sometimes looks or talks like he’s slightly annoyed. Idk if it’s just the way he is. He sent me memes and liked my status on the first day of winter break, but hasn’t done anything since. I wonder if he’s just being nice by doing this because I’ve heard he’s bought a girl friend coffee  before just cuz he’s a “very nice guy” or is he texting me occasionally cuz he actually wants to talk. I’m wondering if I should reach out or if he’ll think I’m annoying for bothering him, especially since we have a slight language barrier and I make a few mistakes when speaking to him in his language. Then again, the delusional side of me is afraid that he does actually like me, but he’s losing interest over break.

1pozzzg,https://i.redd.it/8h246uy5ds7g1.png,Adobe just made AI video creation way more practical (and unlimited until Jan 15),"Adobe just announced major improvements to Firefly, their AI tool for creating images and videos. Here's what matters:

**The Big Problem They Solved:**

You know how AI video generation is like rolling dice? You'd create a video of a coffee shop, and it's *almost* perfect except there's a random cup on a table. Before, you'd have to regenerate everything and hope you get lucky again.

Not anymore. Now you can just tell Firefly to ""remove the cup"" or ""change the background"" or ""make the sky cloudy"" and it fixes just that part. Think of it like having an editor who follows your instructions instead of hoping the AI randomly gets it right.

**Other Cool Stuff:**

* **Better camera control:** Upload a video showing how you want the camera to move, and Firefly copies that motion
* **Video upscaling:** Turn low-quality or old footage into sharp 1080p or 4K video
* **Browser-based video editor:** Combine your AI-generated clips with regular footage, add music, and edit everything in your browser
* **Better image quality:** New partner tools create more photorealistic images

**Limited-Time Bonus:**

If you have a Firefly Pro or Premium plan, you get **unlimited** image and video generations until January 15. Usually you have credit limits, but they're removing those temporarily so people can experiment.

**Bottom Line:**

Adobe is making AI video creation less of a gambling game and more of an actual creative tool where you control what happens. Instead of generating 50 versions hoping one works, you generate once and refine it with simple text commands.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

I have no idea how the books got to 243.5 on this matchup. The Bulls have put less than 105 points on the board in 4 of their last 5 outings, so unless they think Cleveland is putting up 140, I don’t see a ridiculously high score coming to pass. Now granted, the Over has cashed in the last 4 straight meetings between these two squads, but based on the way each team has been playing over the last couple weeks, the Under is far more likely. The Cavaliers put a mere 111 points on the board in their last outing against the Charlotte Hornets in a game that went into OT – my brain is screaming, “243.5 is tall order”. I’m on the Under to hit here.

Otherwise, a prominent chin because he seems to have inherited it from his dad in post-covid appearance. No hair shown because Craig seems to keep his hair combed, as seen from his appearances without a hat.

**Tweek:** Looks ""ill"" & have eyebags because he is canonically a chronic insomniac. And... let's just say the coffee he drinks is a little more special. Green-ish blue eye colour, matching Tweek's eyes from said Tweek x Craig ultimate.

**Tolkien:** Fresh line-up because he could afford one daily. I don't like the way his shirt's T is positioned, maybe could be bigger or have more flair.

**Clyde:** Could be chubbier (if what Butters say is true), but I'm happy with how he looks here (the hair especially, very accurate). Brown eyes because that's how most fans draw him.

**Jimmy:** Even harder than generating Cartman, as AI keeps mistaking his exotropia for esotropia (his eye condition). Brown eyes because my hunch tells me he is based off Jimmy Fallon, who do have brown eyes.

**\[Honorary Member\] Timmy:** Took a lot of fixing (first result had him looking like a fetus lol), and this is as far as I could get. Green eyes because, I don't know tbh, I just associate his strawberry-blonde hair with green eyes.

1pozsdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dad/comments/1pozsdt/fatherhood_in_three_timelines/,"Fatherhood, In Three Timelines","I wrote this piece at three different times: 2 weeks after becoming a father, then after 5 months, and finally 19 months. I just wanted to remember and share what it was like at that point in time. 

Two weeks of Fatherhood:

I just woke up from a 45-minute afternoon napuccino. It's when you take a coffee before a nap. By the time the caffeine kicks in, your nap is over, and you wake up fresh; none of that post-nap grogginess.

This is one of the longest naps I’ve had in the last two weeks. Most days it’s 15–25 minutes. And more often than not, I wake up feeling recharged to power through the rest of the day (or night). It’s like plugging in your phone at 18% on power-saving mode - twenty minutes later, it’s good to go.

I have always been a good napper. But having a baby, it feels like I have levelled up my napping game.

I can now sleep anywhere, anytime. Twenty minutes till my wife finishes feeding the baby, and it’s my turn to burp and change him? I nap. Earlier, I would’ve spent that time on my phone, which only made falling asleep harder.

The first two weeks of fatherhood have forced me to be present all the time. There’s just one thought running in the background: keep the newborn alive and well; no drifting into an immovable past or an unrealised future.

So there’s no boredom. No craving for instant gratification. No revenge procrastination. Just sleep after long, tiring days.

I’m always moving. Diapers to change. Utensils to wash. Cats to attend to - like right now, as I hear Pippin meowing upstairs after his nap. I give him his due attention. Then it’s time to feed the baby again.

Has it been overwhelming? At times, yes.

Is it rewarding? The baby is alive, healthy, a peeing-pooping machine who hasn't yet developed ways to reciprocate affection. But I don't think I've thought about any reward. Even when I pause to look for it, nothing comes to mind.

Maybe that’s the lesson. Being fully present in the action. That itself is the reward.



5 months of Fatherhood:

It’s 2.30 pm. 

I’ve just returned from the hospital. The baby hadn’t peed in about twelve hours - a sign of dehydration and a cause for serious worry. Fortunately, he peed in the paediatrician’s office. I guess he didn’t want to spend a second longer in the hospital than necessary.

I came home and sterilised his teethers. Made coffee - my second shot of caffeine today. I placed him in his bouncer, right next to my work desk.

This isn’t normal. I haven’t really used my work desk much in the last five months.

Nobody told me parenthood would be this tough. Some people did allude to it. I just didn’t think it would be this exhausting.

It does have its rewards.

I now know all my baby’s tickle points. All the funny faces that make him smile. All the tiny cues that tell me what he needs — or what he definitely doesn’t. We go for morning walks - I carry him in a baby carrier. We meet pet dogs, neighbours, and stray cats. It's quite nice. 



19 months of Fatherhood:

We have a nanny now. My son is playing downstairs with her. I can occasionally hear his cries and screams and 'nahin' - that's his favourite word. He's a boy after all - he makes his presence felt. 

His dependency on me has reduced. I still bathe him every day. He still relies on me for aggressive play - I’m told toddler boys need that. I’m more than happy to oblige.

I still work from home. I take frequent breaks to go see him, to play.

Today, he pulled out a small tub, sat in it, and asked me to push him around the house. And then: 'again.' That’s his second-favourite word.

We don’t go on morning walks much anymore. Sometimes I take him to the playground in the evenings. He talks now. Copies everything I say. Has learned how to say “lub you.”

Fatherhood is as exhausting as you want it to be. Or maybe as exhausting as you allow it to be. I’ve been focusing more on work lately. So I've started delegating more around the house, letting my wife take on more of the heavy lifting.

I have no idea how it's going to be in the future. But I’m here for all of it.",1,1765986243.0,dad,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New Hampshire Wildcats vs. Stonehill Skyhawks: A Tale of Three-Pointers and Turnover Troubles**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a matchup that’s about as balanced as a toddler on a unicycle! The New Hampshire Wildcats (3-7) host the Stonehill Skyhawks (3-7) on Wednesday, December 17, 2025, in a game that’s less “March Madness” and more “January Mishaps.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a coach’s whiteboard and the humor of a player explaining why they missed that open three.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The numbers scream “New Hampshire,” louder than a ref’s whistle at a high school free-throw. The Wildcats are installed as **3.5- to 4-point favorites** across most books, with moneyline odds hovering around **-156 to -163** (implied probability: \~61-63%). The total is set at **136.5-137 points**, with “Under” getting slight love, which makes sense given New Hampshire’s suffocating defense (71.5 PPG allowed) and Stonehill’s leaky road performance (70.7 PPG scored).

Key stat to note: **New Hampshire makes 6.5 threes per game (151st nationally)**, while Stonehill’s defense lets in 5.7. It’s like a coffee addict (New Hampshire) facing a barista (Stonehill) who’s out of espresso. The Wildcats need their shots to fall, and the Skyhawks need to stop coughing up the ball—*a lot*.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Rivalries, and Turnover Troubles

**New Hampshire**: Fresh off a **94-43 shellacking by Louisville**, the Wildcats are averaging a palatable 60.5 PPG but getting drilled by 40 points per game. Their defense? Still America East’s fourth-best, holding opponents to 43.5% shooting. Key players like **Raymond Espinal-Guzman** (44.6% from deep) and **Hermann Koffi** (42% on threes) are their offensive lifelines. Coach? Probably muttering, “Just don’t turn the ball over… again.”

**Stonehill**: The Skyhawks are 0-6 on the road, which is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine. They *do* win when they dominate turnovers (1-0), but they average \*\*13

I’m at the beginning of my anorexia recovery and have been using a two-day out of town family vacation as an opportunity to go “all in”. I won’t eat like this every day, but I wanted to allow myself to feast on everything I’ve been deprived of, because I’m tired of living in fear and sometimes you have to go nuclear.

Yesterday, I ate several fear foods I’ve been avoiding for the better part of a year. Things that you could not have paid me enough to eat even two months ago. In fact, every single thing I ate yesterday was high calorie and mentally difficult for me to challenge, but since I’m on vacation, need to gain weight and I’m surrounded by delicious food, why not? 

So I ate eggs benedict, fried potatoes, pizza, cheese sticks, a giant gingerbread scone with cream cheese frosting, half of a brownie, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple bites here and there of what my family was eating (this included pancakes, breakfast quesadillas, and bakery cookies) ALL yesterday. Literally 5x the intake I was eating before, and I woke up and I was fine. In fact, I’m exactly the same, except now I feel FREE. This is the first time in I don’t know how long where I truly feel in my bones like recovery is worth it. 

And when I was out enjoying this food with my family, I noticed something. Inevitably, there was diet talk in a lot of the places I went, as the food was “indulgent”. People on group trips in this amazing city I’ve been in (that is known for its food) who were fretting and worrying about their diets and talking about what they could and couldn’t have while in line or at nearby tables. And I saw myself in them and realized, these people are absolutely MISERABLE. I know how I feel physically and mentally when I’m restricting, I’m familiar with the constant anxiety and the guilt and the shame spiral and the food noise. Watching everyone around you partake in these experiences, eating and socializing, while you’re practically just a bystander at that table. Watching life and the pleasant things it has to offer pass you by.

I realized I in fact do not want to be like the older woman who I saw in the pizzeria eating a salad without dressing while the men she was with ate deep dish pizza, or the people in line at the bakery trying to be “good” when it’s basically a landmark known for its phenomenal pastries (and they’re on vacation). The people I see who pass me on the street who don’t look so different from me, despite my doctor telling me my BMI is in a critically dangerous place. And when I do see those thin bodies pass me by, there is this familiar sense of exhaustion. Of self-denial, of eyes that linger too long on the stack of pancakes next to their bowl of oatmeal and black coffee. 

Is this discipline? Refusal to engage in culture, to enjoy delicacies, to sit at a family meal replaying the exact calories you’re consuming in your head ad infinitum? To deprive yourself until you become a shell? To attain a malnourished body there is no joy in maintaining? Is that really how you want to live every single day for the rest of your entire life? Is it what you’d do if today was your last day?

Being rail thin, especially the kind being pushed in our culture at the moment, has a cost—not only a physical and mental cost, but a social one, too. There are a lot of experiences to be had that will be missed entirely due to restriction, obsession, and rumination. I know what it takes to sustain the unsustainable, and that is not a life worth living. ",5,1765985763.0,EDAnonymous,0,0.78,False

1pozjes,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1pozjes/i_just_want_to_make_a_post_showing_love_for_ember/,I just want to make a post showing love for Ember Coffee cups. Because I thought it was stupid and overpriced when I got one.,"IDK if this is the right sub for this but whatever, maybe someone could use a last minute gift idea. I was gifted an Ember coffee mug 2 years ago. At the time they were like $85-$100 or something like that. MSRP now shows them to be like $120 or something. I was very tempted to tell the person that got it for me to return it because it honestly is ridiculous that a coffee cup would be so expensive. 

Since then I have used this cup almost every day, it works VERY well, and I liked it so well I got one for my wife after a few months and we've both been using them daily. We make it a point to have a few minutes to sit and drink coffee every morning and I honestly feel like I've abandoned all my other mugs that I like because I end up using this. 

If you're on this sub then you're probably like me and want to spend money on things you use frequently. Well, if you drink tea or coffee frequently then I can promise you this is worth the money, especially if you take your time and it's always getting cold. 

Just get the mug, If you put it in an insulated thermos to go then don't bother, A good one can keep it hot most of the day with no power required.",1,1765985681.0,BuyItForLife,1,0.6,False

1pozii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1pozii6/coffee_table_books/,Coffee Table Books,"Between my husband and I, and what we've inherited from our parents, we have a nice little collection of books. Many different topics ranging from art to science to vintage instructionals. We've always had them stacked in neat piles, with the intention to pick them up at random for a quick peruse. But you know how that goes...stuff gets overlooked, collects dust, becomes another thing to clean.

This last year, I started rotating selections for our living room coffee table, 2 or 3 at a time. Now people actually see and read them! The other day, my husband was doing some stretching and I heard from the other room, ""Huh. *The Complete Drawings of Hieronymus Bosh*?!"", and he started flipping through it.  Next to that one I had Dr. Seuss's *Theres a Wocket in my Pocket* and a large picture book that seems to be the quiet authority on garden nomes. 

They don't have to be expensive or fancy or even new to be fun and intriguing. Just something different than what was there before. The older ones and the children's books are probably my favorite, like inviting an old friend to come and sit a while.

If you’re looking to make some easy side money, I’ve been using AttaPoll for a while now. It’s basically an app where you earn by doing small surveys, simple tasks and even some games. Nothing fancy, but it’s legit and payouts are real.

I usually do a few surveys when I’m free or just bored, and it adds up slowly. Not a get-rich thing obviously, but good for coffee money or small expenses.

If anyone wants to try it, you can use my referral link here (helps me and you too - will get 10% extra):

Totally optional, but thought I’d share since there are a lot of scams out there and this one is actually trusted.

1pozfje,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1pozfje/the_3second_trust_test_for_your_store/,The 3-second trust test for your store,"Your visitor just landed on your product page. In three seconds, they’ll decide if you’re legit or sketchy.

Whether you have made a store with Shopify, Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace or any e-commerce platform and then you see there are no sales even with steady traffic or having many abandoned carts - then you’re facing a serious conversion problem. 

Here’s what kills trust instantly and the dead-simple fixes that actually convert:

1. Your Product Photos Look Like Stock Images.
The problem: Perfect white backgrounds, generic angles, zero personality. 
The fix: Add ONE photo that’s clearly yours. Show the product in your hands, on your desk, next to your coffee mug. Imperfect is authentic. Authenticity converts.

2. You’re Hiding Your Face.
The problem: No about page, no photos, just “we” and “our team.” You sound like a corporation. Or worse - a scam.
The fix: Put a real photo of yourself somewhere visible. Even better? A 10-second video saying “Hey, I’m Sarah, I started this because…” People buy from people, not websites.

3. Your “Benefits” Are Just Features in Disguise.
The problem: “Made with premium stainless steel!” Cool. Why should I care?
The fix: Translate every feature into what it MEANS for them.
> Not “Stainless steel” instead “Won’t rust, even if you leave it in the sink for three days”

> Not “1080p camera” instead “Your Zoom calls won’t look like a potato”

> Not “Organic cotton” instead “Soft enough to sleep in, tough enough to actually wear”

4. You’re Blind to Your Own Trust Gaps.
The problem: You’ve stared at your site for so long, you can’t see what’s missing. No security badges? Broken links on mobile? Generic footer that screams “template”? These trust signals are invisible to you but glaring to customers.
The fix: Run your site through audit tools like Pagespeed and ScanCX. They scan your entire store website and points out exactly which trust signals and features are missing - the ones making visitors bounce before they buy. Think of it as a conversion audit that takes less than 60 seconds instead of hiring a consultant for $5,000.

5. Your Urgency Tactics Are Obvious Lies.
The problem: “Only 2 left!” (Refreshes page) “Only 2 left!” (Again tomorrow) “Only 2 left!”
The fix: Real urgency or none at all. If you have 50 units, just say “Low stock on this color.” Or skip the countdown entirely and focus on why they should buy NOW - not because fake scarcity, but because it solves their problem today.

6. Your Checkout Has Surprise Costs.
The problem: Product shows $29. Cart shows $29. Checkout suddenly shows $47 with shipping and “handling fees”
The fix: Show total cost EARLY. “Free shipping over $50” on every page. Or bake shipping into your price. Cart abandonment drops when there are zero surprises.

The Difference-Maker:
Conversion isn’t about growth hacks. It’s about removing friction and adding trust.

Pick ONE thing from this list. Fix it today. Not tomorrow, today. Your conversion rate is just the percentage of people who believe you’re worth the risk. Make it less risky.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1765985420.0,ecommerce,0,0.75,False

Our game, The Corner Cafe, is a cozy cafe simulator set in a Mythical version of Ireland in 2160.

The goal of the game is to create an oasis of community in a dystopia.

You'll get to make and serve coffees and different types of food (chicken fillet rolls to start...), you'll get to customize your cafe and you'll get to change your outfits to better suit your own style!

You'll also get to explore the city and meet all it's strange inhabitants (like Fomorians, Tuatha Dé Danann, Banshees). If you help them you'll be able to unlock new upgrades and customization options for your cafe.

We have been hard at work on this for a long time now, we're a two person team (but just one developer) so it can be fairly overwhelming, but the support we've gotten so far from folks has been absolutely amazing!

If any of this sounds good to you, please consider wishlisting!

1pozdve,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pozdve,Sharing some art from our game Deep Pixel Melancholy. It’s a visual novel about being stuck in a time loop,"The story follows *Egor*, whose life feels like a stuck VHS tape. Utility bills, the same trolleybus to the office, endless paperwork, 3 in 1 instant coffee, and constant exhaustion. His routine breaks when he realizes he’s stuck in a time loop.

We’re making the game mostly as a duo with a friend, with help from other friends too, so the game will have great sound and should ship without bugs =) Even though it’s a visual novel, we want it to be something you actually play, not just read.

What makes it different is that it’s not a typical time loop story. It’s about an ordinary person, how he deals with being stuck, and what goes through his head. The setting is the *Far North* and everything is soaked in *early 2000s vibes*.

This is a dream project for us, so we’d really love to hear what you think and see your comments.

Our game, The Corner Cafe, is a cozy cafe simulator set in a Mythical version of Ireland in 2160.

The goal of the game is to create an oasis of community in a dystopia.

You'll get to make and serve coffees and different types of food (chicken fillet rolls to start...), you'll get to customize your cafe and you'll get to change your outfits to better suit your own style!

You'll also get to explore the city and meet all it's strange inhabitants (like Fomorians, Tuatha Dé Danann, Banshees). If you help them you'll be able to unlock new upgrades and customization options for your cafe.

We have been hard at work on this for a long time now, we're a two person team so it can be fairly overwhelming, but the support we've gotten so far from folks has been absolutely amazing!

If any of this sounds good to you, please consider wishlisting!

Slán!

1pozan3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1pozan3/cold_emailing_for_1l_summer_jobs_what_the_first/,Cold Emailing for 1L Summer Jobs: What the First Email Is Actually For And How To Structure the Strategy,"**Hiya recruits!**

This question comes up a lot, and it’s a good one—because most people misunderstand the purpose of a cold email in BigLaw recruiting.

*“I know I shouldn’t ask for a job upfront. So what* ***is*** *the goal of the first cold email? And who should I be emailing?”*

So to answer that question, here's a couple things I usually think about that I hope might be helpful to you too. 

# 1. The Goal of Your First Cold Email (Spoiler: It’s Not a Job)

The goal of the **first** cold email is **not**:

* to ask for an internship
* to ask for a referral
* to ask for an interview
* to give your resume/app materials and ask for things

The real goal is much smaller (and more achievable and a lot less awkward/transactional-feeling):

**Get a conversation.**

That’s it. Seriously. Just... talking. 

Specifically, you want:

* a short call/zoom (or if you prefer, a coffee chat)
* information about their practice, office, or path
* context you can later reference credibly in interviews and cover letters when you inevitably want to name drop them to show you did your diligence on the firm.

If your first email succeeds, you’ve created optionality:

* They may later flag your name to recruiting
* They may offer to connect you with someone else
* They may tell you procedure on how the firm actually hires 1Ls (i.e. any changes in timing the firm might not have advertised yet, specific groups that expect to hire a ton, etc.)

All of that only happens *after* the conversation.

# 2. What a Strong First Cold Email Actually Communicates

Even if you don’t say this explicitly, a good cold email signals:

* **You’re curious, not transactional**
* **You’ve done at least some of your homework** (office, practice, background)
* **You respect their time**
* **You are not asking them to “get you a job”**

If someone reads your email and thinks:

“This is reasonable and low-pressure curious person just trying to learn,” then you’ve done it right.

# 3. Who You Should Be Targeting (and Who You Shouldn’t)

**A good rule of thumb I personally like (but everyone has their own process, so this isn't gospel), is that you should reach out to at least three to five people at each firm you are interested in:** 

1 junior associate (generally years 1-3 at the firm), 

1 to 3 mid-level associates (years 4-6), 

and 1 senior associate (years 7+). 

It's usually fair to assume that 2-3 out of every 4 people will simply ignore your email because they are just busy/don't want to talk to you/etc. But this system should get you at least 1 person to talk to at every firm.  
  
**Note**, we don’t generally recommend cold emailing partners unless you have another person who first recommended that you reach out to that partner. It's not bad, they're just often not super likely to respond.

That said, a cold email to a partner can work if you have a connection through school, social groups, or otherwise have some sort of connection to them.    
  
**How many cold emails should I send each week?**  
  
I recommend sending three to five cold emails out every week to folks at various firms starting in the Fall semester of your 1L year. This will ensure that by the time pre-OCI and OCI roll around, you will have spoken one-on-one to at least one person (if not more) at each firm you are interested in.  

In particular, I recommend targeting people who ideally hit one or more of these factors: 

1. **People who are practicing in areas of law at a firm you are interested in**
   1. If you’re just starting out and don’t have a firm you’re interested in (or they all just look the same to you), I recommend going through a list of all firms and start with the firms that have practice areas you think you might be interested in (even if just remotely). 
   2. If you’re just starting out and you don’t have a practice area you’re interested in, think about your prior experiences and why you came to law school to come up with a few practice areas that you *might* be interested in. Your interests will of course change as you go through law school and/or talk to more practicing attorneys, but it is good to have a starting point as you target who to network with at firms.  
2. **People who know someone you know**
   1. This is a **key point** in networking. If you can add a line to your cold email that says “I spoke with \[NAME\], and they recommended I contact you to learn more about \[PRACTICE AREA/FIRM\],” then you suddenly have *social validation* with this new contact. This person is now much more likely to respond to your cold email. This is specifically a great way to get people with higher power levels to talk to you. 
3. **People who graduated from your school**
   1. Alumni are usually happy to speak to current students
   2. Additionally, career services at your school should have a list of alumni who have consented to getting calls from current students prior to OCI. Note that at some schools you may have to proactively ask career services for access to this list.
4. **People who are part of similar affinity or minority groups as you**
   1. For example, LGBTQ+ attorneys, First Generation attorneys, African American attorneys, etc.
   2. You can either directly ask questions such as “What does \[FIRM\] do to support attorneys who identify as \[AFFINITY/MINORITY GROUP\]?” or you can subtly ask questions that help you figure out if the firm is actually as committed to diversity as they say they are. If diversity is something that matters to you, you will want to speak to diverse people at each firm you are interested in to learn more about what it actually feels like to be a diverse attorney at that firm. 

**Generally avoid (at first):**

* Partners you have no connection to
* Recruiting inboxes for “informational chats”
* People with zero overlap (nothing in school, geography, practice, background--not that this is bad, they're just less likely to be helpful/responsive)

This isn’t about hierarchy—it’s about likelihood of response.

# 4. What You Should Not Ask in the First Email

Avoid:

* “Are you hiring 1Ls?”
* “Can you pass my resume along?”
* “What are my chances?”
* “Can you recommend me?”

Those questions come later, if at all—and often they’re offered without you asking.

# 5. How This Connects to Actual Offers

Cold emailing works when it’s part of a sequence:

1. Short, thoughtful cold email
2. Low-pressure conversation
3. Thank-you + follow-up
4. Later update when you apply or get an interview

At that point, you’re (hopefully) no longer going to be a random name in a pile.

◈◈◈

*Phew\~ Finally done!*

  
Jin set down the last of the weathered documents and rubbed his temples, pressing hard enough to feel bone beneath skin. His eyes burned from almost an hour of just scanning cryptic text as the Narrator parsed meanings hidden in layers of cult bullshit. His skill was running analysis nonstop, but even a super amazing skill had its costs.

His head felt stuffed with cotton soaked in acid.

*I need an actual active healing skill… Let’s hope the rings we would be cracking next would have some skill imprint cores.*

  
Reyana looked up from her neatly organized piles of documents, each stack categorized by content and threat level. Exhaustion showed in the way her shoulders sagged forward and the dark circles beneath her eyes that hadn't been there yesterday.

""That the last of them?"" Her voice was hoarse from too little sleep.

""Yup,"" Jin said. He leaned back in the creaking chair, let his head tip backward until he was staring at the safe house basement ceiling. ""My skill is still compiling everything, but we're almost done.""

Reyana made a noise somewhere between acknowledgment and complaint. She straightened a few more scrolls into alignment, then muttered under her breath, ""Find me a skill like that, okay? Speed-reading encoded cult bullshit sounds real useful right about now.""

Jin lowered his head enough to look at her sidelong, one corner of his mouth lifting. ""You'd need a couple of free marked slots to get started with something similar. Maybe three or four, depending on how you build it. And the mental strain isn't exactly fun.""

""I have all but one free slot, Tch."" Reyana clicked her tongue, rolling her eyes. ""One. And I'm saving it for something that won't get me killed.""

""That’s a pity,"" Jin said, smirk widening into something more genuine. ""Though if you die from boredom reading this crap, does it count?""

""Shut up."" But there was no heat in it. Reyana stood, stretched with her arms over her head until her spine popped audibly. “I’ll be back in a minute.”

“Got it! Maybe get Joe here as well. We need to get started with the crackdown on the cultist rings.”

“Hmm, will do.” Reyana nodded as she stepped out of the room.

“Okay… she got all the docs nicely stacked… and all sorted.” Jin could see the organizational logic in how she'd arranged everything—logistics separate from ritual components, personnel records away from encoded communications.

Jin yawned.

*Even after being knocked unconscious for almost 15 hours… I’m still sleepy.*  


*«* ***Compilation complete.*** *»*

  
The Narrator's presence pulsed once in his awareness, signaling completion. Information flooded into his mind in organized packets, categorized and cross-referenced automatically.

« ***Analysis summary:*** »

  
The Narrator's voice manifested as usual, cold and clinical. Jin had gotten used to it somewhat, but sometimes the sheer inhumanity of it still unsettled him. It was like having a supercomputer sharing headspace with his consciousness, running calculations and drawing conclusions without ever caring about the results.

*I wonder if there comes a scenario where it deems me to be not important…*

  
Jin shivered at the thought, shaking his head and focusing on the result.

« ***Seventy-three percent of recovered documents contain logistical data. Supply chain records, patrol schedules, cult hierarchy rosters. Standard operational intelligence. Moderate practical value.*** »

*«* ***Twelve percent consists of ritual procedures, alchemical blueprints, and instructional materials. Low to mid-complexity procedures. One-verse sorcery tomes, alchemical potion recipes, essence refinement protocols. High practical value for resource acquisition and skill development.*** *»*

*«* ***Fifteen percent flagged as high-priority intelligence. Breakdown follows:*** *»*  


Jin straightened in his chair, attention sharpening. This was the important part. He focused on the mental readout as the Narrator parsed through encoded fragments and reconstructed meanings from partial data.

◈◈◈

**Decoded Fragment - Outpost Network:**

*""Fourteen pillars stand watch over the city's veins. Each marks a node where the blood flows deepest. When the Convergence aligns, the pillars will channel the flow upward, feeding the Grand Working. Vienna is not the battlefield—it is the altar.""*

◈◈◈

The Narrator's analysis overlaid the cryptic text with its assessment:

*«* ***Fourteen cult outposts mapped to ritualistic locations throughout Vienna. Geographic positioning suggests ley line convergence points. Purpose: Essence siphoning network designed to fuel large-scale working. Current status: Thirteen active outposts remaining after recent operations. One’s core structure was partially destroyed by Salvatore.*** *»*

***« Cult will prioritize rebuilding and setting up that outpost back up. »***  


“Okay, that’s a good start. The more time I get, the more my little virus would gain access.”

 

◈◈◈

**Decoded Fragment - Force Composition:**

*""Fourteen of the Blood Mother's Favored walk Vienna's streets. Each carries their blessings, each wields authority over the lesser swarm. Among them, two stand highest—Hands of divine will, architects of the final symphony.""*

◈◈◈

*«* ***Fourteen ORDER IV cultists confirmed within the enemy’s forces. Designation: 'Favored.' Blessed by their deities. Two ORDER V operatives identified as 'Hands'—proxies with divine authority. »***

Jin's stomach went cold. “Holy… that’s some serious power. And are those monsters like Velakin and that blessed abomination are also there, no?”

*«* ***Yes*** *»*

  
*Hufff… Fuck…*

  
◈◈◈

**Decoded Fragment - Hierarchy Structure:**

*""The Chosen One sits above all, touched by the gaze of those Beyond. Beneath him, the Hierarch guides the faithful. Below the Hierarch, the Hands extend reach into flesh and shadow. The Favored serve as fingers upon those hands, and the Blessed are the tools they wield.""*

◈◈◈

*«* ***Cult hierarchy pyramid structure:*** *»*

*«* ***Apex: Chosen One. Designation unknown. Presumed ORDER VI minimum classification. Direct contact with extra-dimensional entities confirmed through contextual references.*** *»*

*«* ***Command: Hierarch. ORDER ???. Primary operational authority.*** *»*

*«* ***Executive: Two Hands. ORDER V each. Names: Hand Vella (cult designation: The Fleshcrafter), Hand unknown (references suggest shadow or stealth specialization). Direct implementation of strategic objectives.*** *»*

*«* ***Operations: Fourteen Favored. ORDER IV each. Field commanders and elite combatants. One confirmed dead, Salvatore killed one.*** *»*  


*Hmm? When? Did he mention?*  


« ***Negative, there's an ORDER IV, underlord ranker corpse in the corpse ring.***»

*In the what? Corpse ring!*  


*«* ***Yes. Your teammates, at your request, filled one of the rings with all the corpses.*** *»*  


Jin just chuckled, too stunned to say anything on the topic.

*«* ***Estimated three hundred Blessed operatives. ORDER II through ORDER III. Standard combat forces and ritual specialists.*** *»*

*«* ***Support: Unknown number of rank-and-file cultists. Non-combatants, logistics personnel, and corrupted civilians. Minimal individual threat but numerically significant.*** *»*

 

◈◈◈

**Decoded Fragment—The Bleeding Threshold**

*"" We are not a place, but passage. Not door, but wound. When Vienna's essence flows deep enough, the wound opens. What lies beyond will step through, and the city will become the first dominion of the New Order.""*

*— Direct words of the Hierarch*

◈◈◈

Jin's breath caught. He read the passage again, then a third time, each word landing heavier than the last.

*Fuck, that’s Sangvath Anor… that’s their motto, I remember that from the last volumes.*

  
*«* ***Updated****. »*

*« ""****Sangvath Anor"" is identified as the main enemy designation for the dimensional breach event. Purpose: Facilitate entity incursion from external plane into material reality. Vienna designated as primary anchor point for breach. Estimated timeline for sufficient essence accumulation: twenty-four days. After the breach threshold is reached, invasion commences.*** *»*  


*Around three weeks then…*  


◈◈◈

**Decoded Fragment, a journal entry regarding The Chosen One:**

*""I have seen them. Stood in their presence. The Chosen One has many shapes and forms. Their existence scares me more than eternal doom. He is not one of us. He never was. We are simply the hands that build his throne.""*

◈◈◈

*A shapeshifter?*  


***« Among other things, yes. »***

  
Reyana's voice cut through the fog in his head as she appeared with a steaming mug. ""Here.""

Jin blinked up at her, brain still processing information overload. The smell hit him first—actual coffee, not the instant garbage they'd been surviving on. ""That coffee?""

""Yup."" She set it down in front of him.

""Nice. You're a lifesaver."" Jin grabbed the mug with both hands, brought it to his lips without checking the temperature first because exhaustion made people stupid, and immediately regretted it. ""Shit—"" He stuck his tongue out, fanning his mouth.

Reyana snorted. ""Smooth.""

""Shut up."" Jin set the mug down, still grimacing. His tongue felt scalded but functional. Worth it for caffeine. He'd drink lava if it kept him conscious at this point.

Reyana settled into the chair across from him, her own mug in hand. She looked as tired as he felt—dark circles, hair pulled back in a messy ponytail. ""Joe said he'd be down in a minute. So..."" She blew on her coffee, took a careful sip. ""What did we get?""

""A lot."" Jin's voice came out rougher than he intended. He cleared his throat, tried again. ""Most of it's useless logistics crap, but there's important stuff buried in there.""

""How important?"" Reyana leaned forward, exhaustion falling away as curiosity bloomed.

""Fairly important."" Jin met her eyes. “Gimme a second to figure out how to say it without sounding insane.""

Jin ran a hand through his hair, buying himself a second. ""So here’s all the important info: We have at least fourteen ORDER IV cultists confirmed. Two ORDER V called Hands. Something at the top that's at least ORDER VI and maybe higher.""

""Order V? That’s a Lord ranker…"" Reyana repeated, voice flat. ""Oh, shit.""

""Yeah."" Jin's jaw worked. ""I figure we leave those for Joe and Salvatore. That's their weight class, not ours.""

Reyana was silent for several long seconds, then nodded. ""Yeah. Probably for the best."" She set her mug down, leaned back. ""Still leaves a lot of Underlords running around, though.""

""Yeah, it does."" Jin rubbed his temple. ""I'm gonna need to hit ORDER III fast if I want any chance of fighting ORDER IV entities without getting flattened. Hell, I barely made it through Vellakin, and that was with backup and favorable terrain.""

""Jin."" Reyana exhaled slowly through her nose, studied him with an expression he couldn't quite read. ""You know… you're scary.""

Jin blinked at her. ""Heh? I’m what? I’m fairly handsome, I can bet on that, dunno about this scary part.""

“Seriously… Anyway, my dad told me something once. Said to always keep an eye on people who step away from the known paths and blaze their own trail. Those are the dangerous ones."" She gestured at him with her mug. ""You went from ORDER zero to ORDER II in what, a couple of days? With enough achievements, have a mantle manifestation already. That's not normal. That's... yeah. Scary.""

Jin felt heat creep up his neck. Compliments always made him awkward, especially when they came from people whose opinions he actually cared about. And Reyana is just anyone, but she is Salvatore’s daughter, a possible Order VI entity. ""I'm just... surviving. Doing what needs doing.""

""Don't sell yourself short, okay?"" Reyana's voice softened. ""I still need you around to keep harvesting death essence for me, after all.""

""Right."" Jin snorted, tension breaking. ""Just when I thought you were so pure… You turn out to be materialistic.""

""I'm a girl."" Reyana shrugged, grinning. ""We're allowed to be practical about these things.""

They both laughed, the sound genuine and needed after hours of grim work.

“That was a good one, can’t argue with that.” Jin nodded with a smile.

“I know, right? Where’s Joe? I’ll go get him,” Reyana said, pushing back her chair and rising to her feet.

*Time for the rings and havest?*

  
Jin’s eyes drifted to the spatial ring sitting on the table corner—the one which Salvatore had filled with corpses during the raid. Bodies waiting to be processed. Power waiting to be harvested.

""There's one more thing,"" Jin said before Reyana could leave. She paused, hand on the doorframe. ""I think I can transfer the information directly to you. Like the full information packet.""

Reyana turned back, eyebrow raised. ""Transfer how?""

""Harvest."" Jin stood, moving around the table toward her. ""I think it's possible to use my chains as a transmission medium. Dump the whole intelligence package straight into your head so you've got the same information I do.""

""That sounds deeply uncomfortable.""

""Probably will be.” Jin stopped a few feet away, giving her space to decide. ""But it'll be fast, and then you can brief the others with full context.""

Reyana considered for maybe three seconds, then shrugged and held out her hand. ""Don't bite.""

Jin scoffed. ""Wasn't planning on it.""

The Harvest chains manifested around him as thin tendrils of silver. They wrapped around Reyana's outstretched hand, gentle despite their nature, cool against her skin but not painful.

""Ready?"" Jin asked.

""Do it.""

*Narrator?*

« ***Initiating transfer. Compressing data packet. Transmission in three... two... one...*** »

  
The chains pulsed once, bright and sudden. Jin felt the information flow through them like electricity. He saw her eyes go wide, her hand tightened around his wrist hard enough to hurt.

  
*Everything going well?*

  
« ***Yes*****.** »

  
The transfer lasted maybe five seconds, and the chains withdrew, dissipating back into nothing.

Reyana gasped and pulled back, both hands flying to her head. ""Fuck. That... that hurt.""

""Yeah, sorry about that. It’s my first time doing this."" Jin watched her carefully, ready to catch her if she stumbled. ""You okay?""

""Give me a second."" Reyana stayed bent over. After maybe ten seconds, she straightened, still pale but looking much better. ""I've got it. It’s a mess, but the important bits are there."" She looked at Jin, ""We're so screwed.""

""We’ll manage."" Jin couldn't disagree with that assessment. ""But at least now we know one more way to use my mantle effectively… I need to do some tests and figure out the extent of this transfer. Like, can I pass on my techniques? experience?""

Reyana nodded thoughtfully. ""Yeah, that would be a game changer. And again, don’t overexert yourself. You need rest.”

""I know."" Then she was gone, footsteps echoing up the stairs.

“Phew, that went well.” Jin stood alone, surrounded by piles of cult documents and stacks of looted spatial rings. Overhead, he heard muffled voices as Reyana found Joe and Salvatore.

“Yup, gonna leave the ‘briefing others’ part to her.”

Jin sighed and picked up one of the cultist spatial rings. These things were locked, sealed with essence-keyed enchantments that required either the original owner's signature or enough skill to crack the protections. He set the ring back down and headed for the stairs just as Joe's voice called down from above.

""Heard we've got a pile of locked cultist rings!"" Joe's head appeared over the railing, grinning like this was fun instead of work. ""Want help cracking them?""

""Yeah,"" Jin called back. ""There are like twenty-something of them. Gonna take forever to break manually.""

“I’m leaving the rings here. I’ll be in the next room.”

“Okay!”

  
◈◈◈

  
Jin picked up the corpse-filled spatial ring, hefted its weight, and moved to a cleared section of the basement away from the document piles. The concrete floor was stained and cracked, but clean enough. He set the ring down, stepped back, and took a breath to center himself.

The Eternal Sovereign breathing pattern came automatically now, refined through constant practice.

Essence flowed through channels in his body with the rhythm of his breath, cold and steady, priming his system for what came next.

*Alright, narrator, let’s do this!*

  
Jin channeled essence into the spatial ring. The first corpse manifested on the concrete floor in front of him—a cultist, Order II, judging by the residual corruption burns still glowing faintly on exposed skin. Dead for hours, but essence signatures hadn't fully dissipated yet. The body was in bad shape, torn apart by what looked like Salvatore's work, probably.

The chains coiled closer, sensing prey. Jin could feel their anticipation through his connection to them, that alien hunger that was part of the Harvest skill's nature. He exhaled slowly, focused his will, and gave the mental command.

""Let the ***Harvest*** begin!""

A/N: The ways in which Jin can use his mantle just expanded! What crazy stuff do you guys think his mantle should be able to do? Within reasonable bounds, of course!

Small but exciting milestone from building [**Imejis.io**](http://Imejis.io) 🚀

I just shipped an **AI Design Assistant** that lets me create *and edit* designs by simply **describing what I want in plain English**.

No dragging layers.  
No digging through side panels.  
Just: *“Do this.”*

Examples I literally type 👇

* “Create a social post for a coffee shop sale”
* “Make the background blue and center the text”
* “Increase the image size and bold the heading”
* “Turn this into a business card with my contact info”

The AI understands the **current canvas**, applies changes intelligently, and updates the design in seconds.

**Why I built this:**  
Most design tools are powerful—but slow. The real time sink isn’t creativity, it’s micro-adjustments and repetitive clicks. I wanted a workflow that feels more like **thinking out loud** than using software.

**What makes this different (so far):**

* 🧠 Context-aware (it knows what’s already on the design)
* ✍️ Works for both *creating* and *editing*
* ⚡ Perfect for templates, iterations, and experiments
* 🧪 Makes A/B testing feel almost effortless

I’m already using it to spin up variants, refresh old designs, and prototype ideas way faster than before.

Still early, still learning—but this feels like a real step toward **“design at the speed of thought.”**

If you’re an indie hacker or building with AI:

1poz23r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1poz23r/i_get_frustrated_way_too_easily_and_i_have/,I get frustrated way too easily and I have basically no self worth,"I just want to chase my dream of developing an indie game, my plan was to get a CS degree and learn a lot of things about programming and computers in the process, with me being gifted it should be a breeze right? The problem is that I have to be social to get through it. I always had a hard time interacting with people who aren't my mother or people I know I can trust or can have an important conversation with but don't need to be close (like a study coach or therapist, I'm still afraid of them not liking me tho) and with presentations (being the center of attention as the ""weird kid"") Otherwise I have problems with interacting with people and don't have the courage and avoid it as much as possible, including with classmates.

The thing is I am from a Chinese immigrant family and not only did I grow up in a different cultural environment (you know the horror stories right) and not only that, my mom especially would scold me over the littlest things so I always frowned upon immature classmates who do things like swearing in every sentence and drawing dicks, which is like 90% of the dudes at school (might be an exaggeration but you know what I mean) I lag behind a lot with my life, I lost motivation during middle and high school a lot so it took me way too long, I'm currently 24 and haven't even been able to finish year 1 of college but I don't just wanna drop out and waste my potential either. Aside from that due to my autism and giftedness I just think differently I guess, I just don't want to subject other people to my idiocracy, I don't want to be stuck in class with people who hate me. It happened before, I had embarassing autistic outbursts in middle and high school and I'm still afraid of it happening again. It's not like I got help for it until recently bc my parents are stubborn, old-fashioned and also cheapskates. Maybe university would fit me more than college (it would also fit my giftedness better), but apparently it doesn't really make a difference in how much you have to deal with group work, at least not for computer science. It's probably gonna put a lot of pressure on me too and I don't think i can handle it really.

So I got extremely nervous when I had to work in a group in college. Suddenly I had to interact with people I wanted nothing to do with. They're probably on an entirely different page than I am, they might drag me down or I might drag them down bc of my disabilities. It's not like the college was aiding me either, all they did for me was give me extra time for tests, my study coach was very critical of me bc I got so nervous with the group work (which is like over half of the time in college, which I didn't know beforehand) and was basically looking for an excuse to get rid of me. Eventually he got that excuse, when I had a crashout bc I got so frustrated at my work and slammed the table once, not directed at anyone in particular. Apparently that upset my study coach so badly he banned me from all future group work. This makes it impossible for me to get the degree, I don't even get to TRY, I protested multiple times saying this is BS but he just doesn't budge. It's not like it's easy for me to switch to a different study, it's complicated but what I really wanted is a normal college where I could maybe not feel alone anymore and where I don't have to sit in a bus for hours a day.

So the reason this happened may be bc I just get frustrated so easily. I just have the tendency to raise my voice of even have an angry outburst when something doesn't go like I hoped. There are probably multiple causes behind this but maybe it's bc I saw this kind of behavior a lot on tv as a kid, maybe it's bc I feel ashamed and useless compared to the people around me or I'm even jealous of them (I lack life skills bc my parents either neglect me, don't have faith in me or are just busy with other things and my disabilities will probably just get in the way or leave me vulnerable to being picked on), maybe it's bc my family often insulted and badmouted me and screamed at me, maybe it's bc I slept badly and have a headache, maybe it's bc I don't have ANY friends or trustworthy social contact besides my mother, maybe it's bc the people around me are noisy, maybe I should just drink coffee (I don't like the taste tho) I just have a tendency to get frustrated when things don't go as predicted.

I am going through therapy but it feels like it's still in the beginning stages and I need to be able to resume college ASAP. I feel like my self worth has gotten so bad it might actually be irrepairable, the only thing that might increase it and get the ball rolling is proving myself and earning study credit at college, I really need that sense of accomplishment, but my study coach is depriving me from that, so I made pretty much no progress since he blocked me from participating in group projects. The only thing I'm really decent at is gaming, but that won't help me get by. Idk where to even begin at this point, I barely have the courage to do anything anymore, college just comes first and THEN I can do other things like start development on my dream indie game. Maybe when my self worth isn't at rock bottom people will actually start liking me and I might become less socially awkward, might find people with mutual interests irl and have the courage to befriend them. I know I am capable of great things but I feel like the whole world is against me.",3,1765984521.0,Gifted,6,1.0,False
1poz1nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1poz1nk/aita_for_being_strict_about_my_boundaries_if_bfs/,AITA for being ‘strict’ about my boundaries if bf’s mom wanted to go see her daughter with us and she refused?,"This is my first time ever posting. So sorry if it’s long winded. 

I (43f) have been with my s/o (43m) for a little over 2 years but we’ve been in each others lives since we were 18. We weren’t super close, but there was always  chemistry when we were around each other. 

Fast forward to a little over 2 years ago and timing finally allowed us to be together. After about 6 months, s/o and I had some time off of work, so I thought it would be nice for us to take a road trip so I could meet his oldest sister (S) who I’ve since become really close with. I had my car serviced because it was a 5.5 hour drive one way. I got new tires, brakes, rotors, had a full service work up done, all in preparation for this trip. I spent over 500 dollars not including the price of the tires. Now granted, the car needed it, but that’s not the point. 

He told his mom we were going and asked if she wanted to come along. Now I have never had a problem with his mom before so I was fine with that. But then the trip that he and I were planning turned into the trip she was planning. At first we had planned to leave early in the morning, she didn’t want to do that. We were going to stay in an air bnb 15 minutes away, she didn’t want to do that. Like I said before, we were going to take my car, she didn’t want to do that. We didn’t leave until almost 4, so we lost all of Friday with them, we ended up staying in a hotel 45 minutes away, and of course, we took her car. 

I was still optimistic though, I really wanted to meet this part of his family as they were who he was closest with and always talked about. I was still excited. 

We get settled in in our hotel room. The next morning I wake up before them (very common as I am always awake before everyone) and went to get breakfast. The hotel at least had the complementary breakfast. Around noon we all leave to go finally see S. That day was fine. I met his sister, bro in law, nephews, and great nephews. It was all in all a good time. The next morning his mom and I went to breakfast with some of the family. S/o is very NOT a morning person so he didn’t go. We finished and went back to the hotel. By that time s/o was awake. 

His mom wanted to take a nap, but he wanted to go back out and see his nephews. So that’s what we did. Had a nice time. But when we got back to the hotel, s/o noticed that the cars tires were bald and showing wire. He was now very worried that they would not last the drive home. Guess what’s not open on Sunday’s in illinois(at least where we were)? If you guessed any place that sells tires for her car (they were some kind of special tire, I don’t know), you get a cookie. 

So not only did we now have to rely on his family for a way around, we had to wait til Monday to get her tires, which caused me to have to pay for another nights stay. 

I was pretty f’n mad at this point. This lady was costing me more money because she wanted to take her car. Her car that needed fixed while we were there. They had to fix what was ALREADY BRAND NEW ON MY CAR!!!! Did I mention my then 17 year old was watching my then 15 and 10 year old so I could go. He was doing his last year remotely. 

Ok, so trip is over. Everything goes back to normal. Early toward beginning of the year I was invited to go on a girls vaca set for this past July. It was supposed to be me, his mom (she paid for the air bnb) his 2 sisters, and the girls his nephews were dating. It ended up being me, his mom, 2 sisters and his middle sisters (K) son. Whatever. I was just happy to get to go on an actual vacation for the first time without kids in over 20 years. 

We were supposed to meet at his mom’s Sunday and leave early Monday as we were driving from Kentucky to Alabama. Roughly 11 hour drive. They decided to leave that night right after I got there. I worked a 12 hour shift that day and then drove 2 hours to get to her house. They knew I was going to be sleeping the whole way if we left that night. They were cool with that and that’s what happened. I slept almost the whole way down. 

We get checked into the air bnb and we head to the beach. We went to the souvenir shop up the road. We went to a couple different places and generally had a good time that first day. 

Day 2, I’m up before everyone as per usual. I get dressed, have some coffee and breakfast and head over to the beach to just relax. Go back a couple hours later and and everyone is awake and dressed except S. But it’s vacation. She’s awake, just not necessarily motivated yet. And then we sat and did nothing for the next 3 hours while THEY decided what WE were going to do that day. We went back to the beach. Ok fine, we have a whole week. 

Day 3, repeat my morning. When I get back (around 8) everyone is awake except K. She was asleep for the next 4 hours. Mother took a nap in this time as well. And then there was me, bored out of my mind cuz no one wanted to go anywhere. S was not ready to deal with peopling yet. I already knew she wouldn’t be ready to do anything til early afternoon at least. 

Around 2pm, everyone is awake and dressed. Mother then says, ‘Now that K is awake she can drive us to the thrift stores I wanted to go to today.’ S speaks up and asks why she didn’t want me to take her? I’d been up since like 6 waiting for something to do. She says because I wanted K to. Alright. Taken aback a little but whatever. 

Now I love thrift stores. Thrift stores, yard sales, flea markets, I could walk around for hours. We went to 2 and when she found 2 books for her to read, she was done and wanted to go back. Really? So we went back. But S and me still wanted to do stuff. We started naming things we all could do. Everything got shut down. Mother didn’t want to go back out and neither did K. So S and I went out and did stuff. And had a really fun time together. 

When we got back (around 8 or so) mother was mad and refused to talk to us. Are we 5? And literally refused to talk to us unless she absolutely had to the whole rest of the trip. 

I literally ended up spending half of the rest of my vacation alone and the other half with S doing things and bonding all while being ignored by mother. The last night we were there, S and I stayed out til 2am and came back with a pretty new tattoo each. That REALLY upset mother as ‘tattoos look trashy’. I had 6 before I got this one and her daughter and son in law are covered in tattoos. Her precious baby boy (my s/o) has two. But now they are trashy. Ok! 

I ended up driving 8 out of the 11 hours back. I didn’t mind since I didn’t drive on the way down. Mother said 1 sentence to me. ‘Can you pull off the next exit so I can use the bathroom?’ That’s it. For 11 hours. Now my s/o is getting daily/hourly updates. He knows everything that’s been going on. His on my side saying my feelings are very valid. 

Not only did this woman ruin the first time I met the most important people to my s/o, but she ruined the first real vacation I had in a long time without children and only my second time meeting S. This did bring me and S closer together, but I didn’t want it to be at the cost of my relationship with his mother. 

Now for the possible aholeiness. 

This past October for his birthday I planned another trip to go see S. Obviously I had to tell him so he could take the time off work too. I told him that if he wanted to invite his mom it was fine. But I set clear and concise boundaries as this woman had already screwed up my last two ‘vacations’. 

1. I’m taking my car. If she wanted to ride with us, fine, but I’m taking my car. Or she can drive herself.

2. We’re staying in the air bnb 15 minutes from your sister. There’s 2 bedrooms and 4 beds so she can stay with us if she wants. Or she can get her own lodging. 

3. You and I are setting the itinerary. She can voice what she wants to do, and if it aligns with what we want, fine, but I’m going to do what I want, when I want. If she doesn’t want to, she can stay at the air bnb or her room and do what she wants when she wants without us. 

4. We are leaving no later than 8am to start up there. No if’s ands or buts. We will pack the car the day before an be ready to leave early. I was prepared for him to sleep the whole way there anyway, so leaving early was not that big a deal. I just had to get him up and into the car. 

5. I would not under any circumstances listen to his mother ridicule or belittle me in any way. While on vacation or not. 

The reason 5 was a stipulation is because while we were on our way home from Alabama all I heard was her ridicule her son and nephew (who lives with her) about being lazy. The only reason my s/o was there was so someone would be there with the dog while her nephew was at work. My s/o cut the grass and kept everything clean while he was there and her nephew worked 10 to 12 hours a day. She was having another room added to her house and K’s bf was helping with it, but was telling K a bunch of bs about the guys. Who then in turn told mother. So not only was he a narc but he was a shit spreader too. Instant dislike! 

I’ve only been back to his moms once since vacation and she was very cold towards me. She didn’t speak to me the whole time I was there. We were there over night. 

I know this was long, but I thought it was all relevant. So, AITA for setting boundaries with his mom causing her to refuse to go see her daughter with us?",0,1765984492.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.5,False

We have multiple mutual friends who know us both well. Anyway, he sent me a friend request on Facebook about a month after we met. We would officially exchange short messages related to work or our profession in general and we have the same political leanings so we’d occasionally laugh react to each other’s funny political memes and posts. 

Randomly, one day last week, he messaged me and asked if I would like to go to dinner this week. I told him sure and that I’d check my schedule. It took me 2 days to actually get back to him. He didn’t pressure me at all within those 2 days. However, once I gave him 3 different availability dates to choose from, it’s like a switch flipped and he has honestly scared the crap out of me. Which makes me think he was quietly lurking and honing in on me while I had no clue. 

First of all, when I gave him 3 dates of availability, he immediately tried to fill up all of those dates. Dinner, movies, and visiting my place to watch Hulu or Netflix. I was as like no, only one date and we will see how it goes from there. I said we needed to see how we vibed on an official date before we go making future plans. 

Then he started sending me long, convoluted texts that were hard to follow. I didn’t respond quick enough I guess because he randomly followed up with if I “don’t behave” then he’s going to “take me to iHop instead of a nice restaurant” for our first date. I responded with, ok, I guess dinner is off then because I don’t take jokes about someone being patronizing and punishing me for not responding to weird communication well. He came back with insisting that it was a joke and reiterated that we would still go to a nice restaurant for our first date. Again I didn’t respond. 

Next, I just drop the convo and a couple of hours later, I post an updated picture of myself and my kids on Facebook. Several people complimented it in completely normal ways. This guy comments “DIBS!” on the picture then proceeds to send me a message on messenger saying “We need to take some pictures together and go public so some of these other men will leave you alone.” I immediately was completely freaked out. I asked him why he was being territorial when we hadn’t even made it to the first date and he said he wasn’t, went on a rant about how awful men are, and how he’s not like most men and that if most men were like him, there wouldn’t be so many lonely men on Christmas.” I didn’t respond and then he randomly messaged me “sorry I went to get a coffee.” I just left him on read. 

It gets even worse. 

Later that night, he moved from messenger back to text and told me that a requirement for dating him is “conserving water by showering together.” I didn’t respond within 5 minutes and he follows up with “you need to start thinking about how you’re going to conserve water with me.” I told him to explain to me exactly what he means because I’m tired of him talking in riddles and I take the “conserving water” BS as a sexual advance or a really terrible joke.” It took him 5 hours but he finally replied saying that “I just meant that if you were to ask me to shower with you, I’d happily oblige and grab some towels.” Again, just wtf. I’m not even the type of person who would shower with someone. Just not my jam, not my personality. He then follows up explaining how he moves slow with the dating process and he’s different than other men and he’s going to move much slower than what I’m used to.” 

Meanwhile, I’m not responding to him and I did some research. A mutual friend told me that he was really socially awkward, that he’s a combat veteran, and that he has a history of more than one self unaliving attempt and couldn’t work for a while because of it. 

Needless to say, his bizarre behavior coupled with finding out about his mental health history, this guy seems extremely scary and dangerous to me. We were supposed to go to dinner tonight but it’s NOT happening. I’m way too freaked out and offended. 

My options are: 

1) Blocking him on all platforms including email and phone number without explanation 

2) Trying to find a way to gently explain that I’m uncomfortable and no longer interested in a way that keeps me safe. 

Not sure what to do or what to say. I’ve never in my life had an interaction like this in any way. ",6,1765984448.0,dating_advice,21,1.0,False
1poz0jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1poz0jy/from_being_locked_in_to_feeling_done_with/,From Being Locked In to Feeling Done With Manifestation. Has Anyone Been Here?,"Background: 

- Was with my SP for 5 years
- Broke up in 2023 → depression, financial issues, failed exams, loss of direction
- Mid-2024: SP told me he liked someone else → started Law of Assumption

Early on, I realized my self-concept was weak. So I stopped focusing on my SP and worked intensely on myself. That led me to unpack years of trauma, insecurities, and conditioning. 

In 2025, I immersed myself in Neville Goddard, the Bhagavad Gita, non-duality and just ego vs awareness.

As my self-concept improved, my SP’s behavior shifted too. 

Feb 2025: Hot and cold. I eventually blocked him and firmly decided: I am treated with respect. I am valued. I affirmed this and neglected 3d. Also listened to few Neville's lectures daily after my work.

By July 2025, he broke NC and he became kinder and even expressed that he still cares. He admitted he stays away from me despite being 3p because he knows he still has feelings for me and it will ruin everything. 

July-October 2025: My 3d changed a lot in these months.  
- I moved countries
- Changed my university major mid-way
- committed to weight loss and joined gym, lost 15 kgs.
- Returned to my life, and slowly started enjoying life again.
- Met old friends, and made newer ones.

In October, he told me he was officially with a 3P while being engaged in knowing more about me. saying he still cares about me, gets emotional for me, cried when we talks, he wishes things were easier between us. I am special to him etc etc. 

This made me lock in. And stop wavering.

Nov 2025: I “locked in” hard again: heavy affirming, constant Neville, living in assumption, subliminals, Manifestation Videos.

Manifestation “Proofs"":

- Free Coffee
- Specific compliments
- Obscure objects and gifts
- Very specific things (e.g., a cat with two eyes)
- Multiple successes with thought transmission
- Clear evidence my assumptions affect my reality and many more.

But now, December 2025: 

I crashed. I got physically sick, exhausted, overstimulated. At the same time, my self-concept has improved but so has my self respect and anger towards sp, 3p and several aspects of 3d when they misalign with my Imaginal life.

I don’t want to affirm anymore. I don’t want to watch manifestation or spirituality content. I just want to live. Yet there’s this weirdness and confusion underneatham I giving up? Am I failing? Or am I just exhausted?

I’m not asking what to do. 
I’m asking what is happening. 

Why does someone go from being completely locked in to feeling repelled by manifestation itself? Is this detachment, burnout, integration, or something Neville spoke about?",8,1765984418.0,lawofassumption,4,1.0,False
1poz040,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1poz040/unspoken_office_culture_rules/,Unspoken office culture rules…,"…are driving me CRAZY. I’ve largely worked in hospitality (ie with a lot of neurodivergent people) or freelance/wfh roles and now I’m in a proper big office and this is a great thing for me in many ways but the weird unspoken rules are making me feel less confident than I ever have in a job. 

Generally, I’m great at jobs — not at staying in them for a long time (because of the boredom, the need for ""new"") or enjoying them, but ask anyone I’ve ever worked for and they’d have amazing things to say (about everything except for my ability to stay in one place). 

New office job and my superior made a comment about me not coming in as early as the department manager would like. I was already coming in 10-20 min before start time (and only ~half of the team would already be there then), always have my coffee and notes ready before the day starts. He suggested aiming to come in somewhere around NINETY MINUTES before start time just to be on the safe side. 

Now, I’ll be there at 5am if that’s what’s being asked — but if that’s the case, please just *ask* it (and tbh, pay for it too, lol). All of this having to read between the lines business is turning me into an anxious mess. 

At 5pm, meanwhile — when I’m used to wrapping things up, letting things come to a natural end — everyone is RUSHING for the exit like the building is on fire. 

It’s not just the start and end time. I haven’t been given any clear directives, just told to generally ""do my thing"" and I’m freaking out. Tell me *exactly* what you want and I can guarantee I’ll do it better than it’s ever been done before, but all of this guessing is making me feel burnt out before I’ve even properly started. 

Anyone dealt with this before and have any advice? I know I should just ask my superiors to be more direct, but I don’t even know how to phrase it or what to ask for since it’s not just one thing, and I’m afraid (especially with the stuff that relates to my actual work) that their take away will be that I’m not a self starter/can’t take initiative.

I did the Twint Spin and Win, and I got a 110CHF voucher off a CoffeeB globe machine that is only 149CHF in total, so it's a pretty good win.

But seeing as I already have a Sage barista coffee machine, I don't need a second coffee machine. So I was wondering if its possible just to give someone the voucher code and it will work for them?

And if so, if there are any struggling students here on Reddit that would like that code to get this coffee machine?

1poyylc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1poyylc/hr_afterlife_death/,[HR] Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1765984288.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Some flavor combinations just make sense. Chocolate and hazelnut? That's coffee magic waiting to happen. [www.coffeeduke.com](http://www.coffeeduke.com) 

When rich, buttery hazelnut meets deep, luscious chocolate in your morning cup, something extraordinary occurs. Your regular coffee routine transforms into a dessert-like experience that feels both indulgent and comforting.

# Why This Flavor Pairing Works So Well

The science behind chocolate hazelnut coffee is simple. Hazelnuts bring natural oils and a subtle sweetness that complements coffee's inherent bitterness. Add chocolate's rich depth, and you've got a flavor profile that hits every taste note.

Think Nutella in liquid form. But better.

The combination creates:  
• Smooth, creamy texture without adding dairy  
• Natural sweetness that reduces need for sugar  
• Rich aroma that fills your entire kitchen  
• Dessert-like satisfaction in every sip

# Coffee Duke's Chocolate Hazelnut: Crafted for Perfection

🌟 **Shop Now and Experience the Difference!**

Coffee Duke's Chocolate Hazelnut isn't just another flavored coffee. It's a carefully crafted medium roast that starts with specialty single origin beans.

**The Process:**  
• Single origin, premium coffee beans  
• Small batch roasting in the USA  
• Flavored while warm for maximum absorption  
• Medium roast preserves natural coffee notes

This method ensures the chocolate and hazelnut flavors penetrate each bean completely. No artificial aftertaste. No overwhelming sweetness. Just perfectly balanced flavor in every cup.

The medium roast provides the ideal foundation. Light enough to let the flavoring shine. Dark enough to maintain coffee's natural richness.

# Morning Indulgence Made Simple

Chocolate Hazelnut Coffee works any time of day:

**Morning Ritual:**  
Transform your wake-up routine into something special. The dessert-like flavor makes early mornings feel less like work.

**Afternoon Pick-Me-Up:**  
Skip the candy bar. This coffee satisfies sweet cravings while providing caffeine energy.

**Evening Dessert:**  
Pair with a small pastry for a guilt-free dessert experience.

# Brewing Tips for Maximum Flavor

**Water Temperature:** 195-205°F for optimal extraction  
**Grind Size:** Match your brewing method  
**Ratio:** 2 tablespoons per 6 oz water  
**Timing:** Don't over-extract; 4-6 minutes max

The flavoring in Coffee Duke's beans is designed to bloom properly with correct brewing techniques. Too hot, and you'll burn the delicate chocolate notes. Too cool, and the hazelnut won't fully develop.

# Versatile Grind Options for Every Brewer

🎯 **Perfect for Your Setup!**

Coffee Duke offers multiple grind options:  
• Whole bean for maximum freshness  
• Medium grind for drip coffee makers  
• Fine grind for espresso machines  
• Coarse grind for French press

Each grind size is optimized to extract the best flavor from the chocolate hazelnut combination. The beans are ground to order, ensuring peak freshness when it reaches your door.

# Single-Serve Convenience Options

Modern life requires flexibility. Coffee Duke's Chocolate Hazelnut comes in convenient single-serve capsules compatible with:  
• Keurig machines  
• Most single-serve brewers  
• Office coffee stations  
• Travel brewing systems

Single-serve options maintain the same quality as whole bean versions. Each capsule contains the perfect amount for one rich, flavorful cup.

# Size Options for Every Coffee Lover

**2 lb Bag:** Ideal for regular drinkers

# Recipe Ideas to Elevate Your Experience

**Iced Chocolate Hazelnut Latte:**  
• Brew double strength  
• Pour over ice  
• Add splash of milk  
• Optional: whipped cream topping

**Hot Chocolate Hazelnut Mocha:**  
• Add 1 tbsp cocoa powder to grounds  
• Brew normally  
• Stir in small amount of cream  
• Dust with cinnamon

**Chocolate Hazelnut Cold Brew:**  
• Coarse grind, 12-hour steep  
• Strain thoroughly  
• Serve over ice  
• Natural sweetness shines through

# The Coffee Duke Difference

Small batch roasting makes a difference you can taste. Large commercial roasters process thousands of pounds at once. Flavors get lost. Quality suffers.

Coffee Duke roasts in small batches. Each batch receives individual attention. Flavor development is monitored carefully. Beans are flavored at the optimal moment when they're still warm and receptive.

This attention to detail creates superior flavor absorption. The chocolate and hazelnut become part of the coffee, not just coating on the surface.

# Perfect for Gifting

Chocolate Hazelnut Coffee makes an excellent gift:  
• Appeals to most coffee drinkers  
• Familiar, comforting flavors  
• Premium quality without premium price  
• Beautiful packaging ready for gifting

Whether for holidays, birthdays, or corporate gifts, this flavor combination rarely disappoints.

# Customer Satisfaction Guarantee

Coffee Duke stands behind every bag. If you're not completely satisfied with your Chocolate Hazelnut Coffee, they'll make it right.

No complicated return process. No restocking fees. Just simple customer service focused on your satisfaction.

————————————-

I write between things.

Meetings. Coffee.Relations. Overthinking.

Some messages arrive.Most don’t and that is fine.

I file that under people having lives.I am learning not to take attendance.

Still, when something does arrive,I read it slowly like it might evaporate if rushed.

The heart is like glass, they say apparently.fragile and just transparent enoughto notice when someone looks past it instead of in.

We learn gentleness that way and stop forcing depth, but we don’t stop offering it where it’s welcome.

There’s an almost something I deliberately leave unexamined. The moment you poke it,magic asks for logic and quietly leaves.Digging turns sparks into chores just like chemistry experiments into paperwork.

If it mattered, it wouldn’t need persuading and it would’ve stayed curious on its own.

I know most don’t care but that is not a complaint but just weather forecast.And slowly, kindly, I am also learning to care less too.

Maybe it’s karma, circling back gently,teaching me how waiting feels without entitlement.

I carry small regrets like choosing the wrong perfume for a moment that needed something quieter. Not every connection wants a future but some just want to be felt for the length of a breath and I have stopped rushing past that.

Not romance. Just life. Misjudged rooms, misread timing, versions of myself that almost fit and lingered longer than they should have.

Some impressions stay, not because they were right, but because life rarely tells you when to leave the room.

There are no pink or purple skies here.No cinematic timing. Just ordinary hours where things either happen or they do not and both are allowed.

If this feels distant, it just isn’t.It is careful. Careful things last longer.

Reply if you want. Scroll if you’re done.

Either way, I will still be here writing like I am detached, feeling just enough to keep it gentle.

If you are still reading, thank you. That counts more than you think.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

I am coming up to Ohio for the holidays and need a place to hang out one evening while my bf goes to a Cavs game. We will be meeting up afterwards with his friends so I need to stay walking distance or within a 5-10 minute drive of the arena. 

Ideally, I’m looking for a spot with comfy seats and not super loud music so I can try to make a dent in this monster book I’m reading. Comfy seats aren’t a deal breaker but definitely no crazy loud music

Breweries are fine so long as I can sit for a few hours (6:30-9:30pm ish) You know how some breweries are more like restaurants and they want you to eat and leave and it’s super busy? I’m not looking for those ones. I was looking at Bookhouse since I saw it recommended under a similar post

Coffee shops are ideal but I didn’t see many open later in the evening other than Ebreeq and it looks a little….sterile? Coffee shop bars are even better!

1poyx4c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1poyx4c,Upgraded Jade Terra: 7800X3D/NH-L12S and 5070 Ti Gaming SFFPC,"Two years ago, I built a Terra 7800X3D/4070 gaming PC that has served me well. Link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/181g0ez/yet\_another\_jade\_terra\_7800x3dnhl12s\_and\_4070/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/181g0ez/yet_another_jade_terra_7800x3dnhl12s_and_4070/)

However, since the 5070 Ti represents a roughly 50% improvement in graphics performance, one of my kids was interested in buying the 4070 from me, and the 5070 Ti came down to MSRP... upgrade time.

I went with the ASUS Prime 5070 Ti and had a custom cable made by DreamBig by Ray, which fit really well. The ""Coffee"" silicone wires worked well with my Noctua theme the original PSlates Customs cables had. I used the 90 degree connector, but did had to cut off a tab to keep it from interfering with with the ASUS Prime heatsink. One snip and no big deal.

Below is the old build with new components:

7800X3D: Excellent gaming performance and low power draw

NH-L12S: Barely fits the B650E-I, set to intake

Corsair SF750 (old): Build’s wattage of \~500W sits in this PSU sweet spot, PSU fan barely turns

ASUS B650E-I: Had all the features I was looking for

G.Skill Ripsaw S5 DDR5 6000: Intel, not AMD version, but does work at 6000

Samsung 990PRO 2TB: Seems fast :-)

ASUS Prime 5070 Ti - 3 fan cooler, runs quietly, fits Terra, no RGB

Fractal Design Terra Jade: Beautiful and good to build in

Custom cables from PSlate: Really helped with excess cable length

Custom GPU cable from DreamBig by Ray

NF-A12x15: Case fan under PSU, set to exhaust

NA-FG1-12: Grill for 120mm fan

I have the case spine set to about “2.5” and there is 5 mm of clearance between the side panel GPU cooler. I have the NH-12S CPU cooler touching the side panel to give as much room to the GPU cooler fan to panel spacing as possible. I have no unpleasant sounds with this combination.

The build went smoothly, this case is stoutly built. I assembled all the critical items outside the case and powered them on first, then stuffed into the case. Thought I don’t have a drive of this type, I did route a SATA cable in with the rest of the cables. I offset the PSU by 10 mm to provide a cooling channel.

The NH-12S perfectly fits the B650E-I but when the combination is installed, the only airflow direction that isn’t seriously choked off is down. So I set up the case as intakes on the sides and exhaust down. My earlier build had a 90 mm case exhaust fan mounted with some custom brackets above the PSU/GPU area, but I removed it for this iteration. The system is running fine as it is.

The 7800X3D pulls at most 87W that I’ve seen, though I have an all core undervolt of -25 in the AMD PBO section of the BIOS with ""motherboard limits"" applied. My undervolting guide is linked below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/18f68b4/simple\_precision\_boost\_overdrive\_undervolting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/18f68b4/simple_precision_boost_overdrive_undervolting/)

I have further tweaked the BIOS with a 102 BCLK, the iGPU disabled, and memory running at 6120 with one of the tweaked settings. (I'll try and find some time to document this stuff like my PBO guide).

I did have a pretty aggressive undervolt running on the 5070 Ti that worked great for benchmarks but crashed Doom: The Dark Ages reliably, so right now I'm just running the GPU with stock settings.

Temperatures while gaming are fine, mid 60's for both the GPU and CPU. The fans aren't working hard at all and the SF750 (old) fan only slowly turns when it turns at all.",14,1765984194.0,PcBuild,11,0.9,False

As I write this, sipping on a hot cup of coffee, I’ve been thinking about what I want this page to be about. I see so many people in the health, wellness, and fitness space doing a lot of the same thing: “Eat this, not that” or “the ingredient in the product does more harm to your kids.” Then, on the other side, I see the polar opposite of influencers debunking the myths/ fear tactics. It becomes dizzying and almost unwatchable for me, especially when what is being said is a lie. 

I am not an expert in every single aspect of health, and I will never claim to be. My experience over the last 14 years working with individuals in health and fitness institutions has given me a love of helping people. This venture is an extension of that love of helping people. 

Our culture has become so indulged in our health, to the point that Pop-Tarts is offering a “High Protein” option. This is why I have decided to put my hat in the ring. My experience has allowed me to sniff out the good, the bad, and the ugly in what is being pushed to us. 

What can be expected in this page is simple: a no-nonsense look at what is and isn’t true in products, workout tips, recipes, and just a look at life.

Our game, The Corner Cafe, is a cozy cafe simulator set in a Mythical version of Ireland in 2160.

The goal of the game is to create an oasis of community in a dystopia.

You'll get to make and serve coffees and different types of food (chicken fillet rolls to start...), you'll get to customize your cafe and you'll get to change your outfits to better suit your own style!

You'll also get to explore the city and meet all it's strange inhabitants (like Fomorians, Tuatha Dé Danann, Banshees). If you help them you'll be able to unlock new upgrades and customization options for your cafe.

We have been hard at work on this for a long time now, we're a two person team (development is all done by one person, the other handles marketing) so it can be fairly overwhelming, but the support we've gotten so far from folks has been absolutely amazing!

I wake up, go to work, come home, repeat. Same routines, same environment, same thoughts. I don’t really have a friendship circle, and I don’t have much family support either. Most days, the thing that genuinely keeps me going is coffee.

I do work out, but only in phases. I’ll be consistent for a while, then drop off. Same with eating healthy. Nothing excites me anymore. Outside of work, I mostly just consume social media, binge-watch YouTube, and play video games to pass the time. Weekends are even more unbearable because of this. I just end up stuck in my own head, doing the same things over and over.

Emotionally, I feel numb. Not sad exactly , just flat. Like I’m watching my life instead of living it. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, what’s the point of all this? When do I actually get to be happy?

I keep coming back to the idea that maybe the key is relationships that have real connections, good people. But I honestly don’t know how to find them anymore, or why it feels so hard at this stage of life.

I’m not in crisis, but I also don’t feel alive. Just stuck in a loop, waiting for something to change.

If anyone else has felt like this or found a way out of it, I’d really like to hear how you handled it.",4,1765983711.0,Healthygamergg,4,1.0,False
1poypu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1poypu4/aita_for_posting_a_cuddling_photo_with_my_ex_on/,AITA for posting a cuddling photo with my ex on Instagram and coming home to find my husband had emptied our entire house?,"I posted a picture of me cuddling with my ex on Instagram and my husband emptied our entire house while I was sleeping.

So my ex and I dated for four years in college. We broke up seven years ago because he moved across the country for work and I wasn't ready to follow. We stayed friends. Not close friends but we'd text on birthdays and comment on each other's posts. My husband knew about him. I was always honest about our history.

Three weeks ago my ex messaged me saying he was in town for a work conference. Asked if we could grab coffee. I said sure and told my husband about it. He just said ""okay"" and went back to his laptop. Didn't ask questions or anything.

The coffee thing was fine. We talked about work and his life in Seattle. He mentioned he'd been single for a year. That his last relationship ended badly. He seemed lonely. I felt bad for him honestly.

Then last week my husband had to fly to Chicago for four days for some big client presentation. The night before he left my ex texted asking if I wanted to get dinner since he was still in town for the conference. I said yes. My husband was packing and I told him. He stopped folding his shirt and looked at me for a second then just said ""have fun"" in this flat voice.

Dinner was at this Italian place downtown. My ex brought a bottle of wine. We split it. Then we ordered another bottle. By the time we left I was pretty drunk. He offered to drive me home and I said yes because I couldn't drive.

When we got to my place he helped me inside. I was stumbling a little. He asked if I was okay and I said I just needed to sit down. So we sat on the couch. We were talking about old memories from college. He put his arm around me. It felt comfortable. Familiar. Like old times.

I don't know whose idea it was but we ended up lying down on the couch together. Not doing anything. Just cuddling while we talked. He was playing with my hair like he used to. I took a picture of us because it felt like this sweet moment between old friends. You could see his arm around me and my head on his chest. I posted it to my Instagram story with the caption ""Some connections never die"" and a bunch of mutual friends from college would see it and think it was nice.

Except then I started thinking about how it might look. My husband follows me on Instagram. I was drunk and probably not thinking straight. So after like twenty minutes I deleted the story. My ex fell asleep on the couch. I went to bed in my room.

The next morning he was still there. I made coffee. We had breakfast. He said thanks for letting him crash and left around nine. I texted my husband ""hope your presentation goes well"" but he didn't respond. He usually responds within an hour. But I figured he was busy.

He didn't respond that whole day. Or the next day. On the third day I tried calling. It went straight to voicemail. I started to feel sick. Like something was really wrong.

He was supposed to come home Friday night. I got home from work around six and the door was unlocked. That was the first weird thing. I walked inside and everything was gone.

Not like robbed. But everything that was his. His clothes. His PlayStation. His desk from the spare bedroom. The TV we bought together. The couch. The dining table. The bed. The dresser. All the artwork he picked out. Kitchen stuff. Everything.

The only things left were my clothes, my car, and my old furniture from before we got married that was in the garage. There was a note on the kitchen counter where the table used to be.

""I saw the post before you deleted it. I screenshot it. I tried to call you that night but you didn't answer. I was on the hotel room floor having a panic attack while you were cuddling your ex in our house on our couch. I'm done. My lawyer will contact you. Don't call me. Don't come to my parents house. I've already told them everything. The forwarding address for any mail is 2847 Berkshire Road unit 304. That's my new place. You won't be welcome there.""

I tried calling him fifty times. He blocked me. I drove to his parents house. His mom answered the door and said ""You have a lot of nerve showing up here"" and closed the door in my face.

I called my best friend crying. She said ""What did you expect? You cuddled with your ex and posted it online while your husband was out of town."" I tried to explain it wasn't like that. We were just friends. Nothing happened. She said it didn't matter what happened. It mattered what it looked like and what it meant.

I went to his new apartment. The building has a security door. I buzzed his unit like fifteen times. He never answered. I sat in my car outside for three hours until a neighbor threatened to call the cops on me.

That was five days ago. Yesterday I got an email from a lawyer. Divorce papers. He's citing ""irretrievable breakdown of marriage"" and he's not asking for anything except to split our savings account 50/50 and keep whatever belongs to him. Which he already took.

I've been sleeping on an air mattress in an empty house. All our photos together are gone. He must have taken them. His family won't talk to me. Our mutual friends have stopped responding to my messages. One of them told me he showed everyone the screenshot and told them the whole story.

My mom says I was stupid but it was just a mistake and he's overreacting. My sister says I emotionally cheated even if nothing physical happened. My dad won't talk to me about it at all.

I keep looking at that screenshot. I can see why it looked bad. My head is on his chest. His arm is around me. We look like a couple. The caption sounds romantic. But we were just friends. I was drunk. I wasn't thinking.

I didn't cheat. I didn't kiss him. I didn't sleep with him. We just fell asleep on the couch. Was that really worth throwing away five years of marriage? AITAH?

Our game, The Corner Cafe, is a cozy cafe simulator set in a Mythical version of Ireland in 2160.

The goal of the game is to create an oasis of community in a dystopia.

You'll get to make and serve coffees and different types of food (chicken fillet rolls to start...), you'll get to customize your cafe and you'll get to change your outfits to better suit your own style! 

You'll also get to explore the city and meet all it's strange inhabitants (like Fomorians, Tuatha Dé Danann, Banshees). If you help them you'll be able to unlock new upgrades and customization options for your cafe. 

We have been hard at work on this for a long time now, we're a two person team (but just one developer) so it can be fairly overwhelming, but the support we've gotten so far from folks has been absolutely amazing!

If any of this sounds good to you, pleaase consider wishlisting!

P.s. Charlotte 👑, I love you.

This happened last week and my friend and I hadn't talked since then when we usually text if not every, then every other day and we see eachother 2-3 times a week or even more, so this disconnection is quite odd and seems deliberate to me.
 
I (30F) and my friend (also 30F) recently became single. Me by choice, while she got dumped by an idiot - don't know if it's relevant. So the supreme court (us) decided we deserve a girls only sleepover at my place. I got the food, she got the wine, we watched Bridgerton and got tipsy, cried, binged all the food, sang karaoke, cussed men and stalked her ex's profile from my page, lol.

When it was time to go to bed she told me she didn't bring any pajamas or comfortable clothes for sleeping, hoping I would give her some of mine. Aaaand here comes the problem. I'm against body shaming and I think she is hot af, but our bodies are very different sizes. I'm 50kg and wear mostly xs and s, I train hard and I like to wear tight fitted clothes. Think like sports leggings, crop tops, etc. I hate the feeling of oversized baggy clothes on me. My friend is around 75-80kg and although her weight is awesomely distributed, it would be impossible for her to fit in my clothes, or if she somehow did fit, she would damage them or be very uncomfortable and no one wants to be suffocated in their sleep. She likes to wear baggy clothes, often a size bigger than needed for her, as she doesn't like it when clothes are tight on her body, even if they are elastic. So although she's a size L her wardrobe is mostly XLs and oversized shirts.

When she suggested I give her something mine, I was puzzled and due to our shared sense of humour, I thought she was joking so I laughed. Her face then changed and I immediately knew I screwed up. I told her I don't think I have anything that would be comfortable for her. I specifically tried not to use the word ""fit"" as I thought it would be even more offensive. I explained to her that everything I have is very tight. What confuses me is that she KNOWS my wardrobe and she often comments when I show her my new clothes how she's weirded out by how tight they fit me. So for her to suddenly decide she wants to put on my clothes is a strange request. 

She asked me if I think she won't fit in my stuff as if looking for an argument. We never argue like that. The answer was obvious, I thought. But I didn't want to say it. It was like she was trying to rip an insult out of me, when I honestly have no issue with her body. Fortunately she quickly dropped it and decided to sleep in her underwear. 

The morning after we both had work and we only got to drink coffee in a half awaken state for a short time and none of us touched the subject. That was 6 days ago and I don't know if she's busy or mad at me, and this hurts me as I value our friendship a lot. It would suck for it to end over a stupid ""argument"" about clothes.

P.s. She has never shared having any issue with her body or weight, or anything like that so I don't think it's a complex of any kind. For all I know, she has all the confidence a person needs and then some more, as she should! While I train for muscle and have a gym girl body, her extra weight goes in curves no exercise will fill in for me 🤷‍♀️ I honestly think my weight is not sustainable for her body type and won't look good on her.

I'm thinking of approaching the issue by the end of the week, but I'm not sure how yet. Any advice would help and if you guys decide ITA, then I guess an apology would be the starter of the conversation.",4,1765983571.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,0.83,False

TODAY'S 🎙SHOW: In this episode of Monero Talk, David Burkett, creator of Litecoin's MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) and developer of Grin++, discusses cryptocurrency privacy technologies with host Douglas Tuman. He shares his journey from early Bitcoin interest to becoming more coin-agnostic due to Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy limitations. Burkett explains how MWEB provides basic privacy features, such as hidden transaction amounts and no address reuse, but clarifies that it doesn’t offer the same unlinkability as Monero. He also discusses MWEB’s extension block structure, adoption challenges, and the future of privacy coins, including potential atomic swaps between MWEB and Monero.

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

1poyg82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1poyg82/aitah_for_expecting_my_husband_to_rinse_out_lunch/,AITAH for expecting my husband to rinse out lunch containers?,"I feel like this is a common sense adult thing to do?

Background: I'm not working right now because of significant medical issues where I struggle to have the energy to do anything. He is the only one working, however, the majority of the income we have been living on for the last year is my savings from working 5 jobs at once prior to getting sick.

I have been the only one taking care of raising the kids, feeding everyone, cleaning up after everyone, doing all of the chores inside the house and outside of the house, I handle all the finances, and I handle literally everything. He goes to work, comes home and relaxes, occasionally mows or shovels snow while grumbling about it while our teenager actually does most of the work. I ask that he takes the trash out to the curb because he wakes up before me so I don't have to get up and get dressed early to go take it out. (He still forgets regularly so I am left to handle the subsequent consequences.)

I also make his lunch every single day the night before, along with 2 custom drinks that resemble the tea/water and coffee combo people buy at specialty shops. His lunches are not simple sandwiches, these are legitimate multi-step meals I cook special for his lunch and I make a second smaller item for him to eat during his second break. Usually I pack these lunches in bento boxes or plastic storage containers.

He works at a job where they have a lunch room with multiple microwaves, refrigerators, plastic silverware, and sinks at his disposal. My only request has been that he rinses his containers out after he eats at work so he doesn't shut them and leave them to sit for several hours before he brings them home and puts them in the sink. He says no one does that at work and it is weird for him to rinse out his dishes. I've explained that when I go to open the containers after they have been sitting all day with food residue on them they stink like rotting food and that smell is going to get in the plastic. 

He used to rinse his dishes out occasionally but ever since I explained that it's really gross to open an airtight container that has been sitting all day he now waits until he gets home to do it very poorly with food residue still on the containers. (He also puts out the nonverbal cues that he is angry with this task via being loud, slamming things, or groaning while doing it.)

Last night I found another bento box container that was sitting all day and he put sealed into the sink yesterday for me to find last night and having to wash it out before making his lunch. The container still had his plastic silverware from work and parts of uneaten food in it. I'm getting to my wits end. 

Another thing that may be important: my medical issues are GI in nature and nausea is a very real part of this. I also have been on extremely restricted diets where I cannot eat the types of foods I cook for the family yet I crave them. So not only am I eating a plain restricted hospital level diet a lot of the times, wishing I could eat a lot of this stuff I'm making him... I'm also already very sensitive to food related smells with nausea and vomiting just being a routine part of my life now even with rx strength anti nausea medications. So opening containers like this just sucks, and maybe I'm just being too sensitive about it. 

So realistically am I the one being unreasonable by asking him to just rinse out the dishes before he even comes home? Is it that weird of an ask? I used to rinse out my own containers every day when I was working, it takes less than a minute when the food is fresh because nothing has dried onto the surface of the dish.  And that smell sitting all day in your lunch box and containers is just gross to me. But he says people look at him weird at work when he rinses out his dishes, no one else does it, and people say I'm being too demanding. Although, he also frequently mentions other people are jealous of his meals and most people get plain sandwiches and a bag of chips so maybe other people don't have dishes? I don't know. 

I want him to feel taken care of and that I care which is why I do all of this. But I feel like this is disrespectful and that he is not appreciative of the extra half hour to hour of work I'm doing every night to do this for him. It just all feels like a slap in the face.

I cut down on coffee pretty much completely after I started taking the meds as I read that the combo of two stimulants is not good for your cardiac health long term. 

I do drink some tea every now and then just because I need that caffeine fix every now and then. I’m wondering though - would it be bad if I drank a cup of tea every day?

I went to community college, worked myself to the bone, and got into a Top 40 university. Grinded for 2 years and graduated with honors, minimal debt. Finally got a decent job 8 months after graduation at a nonprofit. After 3 years there, I got laid off in February. As a short term solution, I got a job as a barista (what I did part-time in college) and spent every non-working hour applying to jobs, collecting certifications, and networking. 

In 10 months, I’ve had one lead. After making it past the first 2 rounds they gave me a project to complete, and I’m kind of embarrassed to say I put my whole ass into it. I felt I went above and beyond (probably the wrong move in retrospect). 6 weeks of silence later, a template rejection letter hit my inbox. It didn’t even have my name in it. Just “Dear Applicant”.

I’ve started applying to restaurants, because at least there I can make more money than in coffee. But they won’t hire me either. Most days, after my shift ends, I walk around my city, drop resumes, and try to connect. Nothing. Even through friends on the inside, no one’s interested. I’ve applied to catering companies to get some extra shifts on my off days. Nothing. I can’t even get a job as a busser to get my foot in the door. 

My savings has been drained. I can barely pay my rent. I make lattes for some of the wealthiest people in America and walk away with maybe $500 a week. I skip breakfast, eat PBJ for lunch, and ramen for dinner. I had to give up my dog to a family member because I couldn’t afford having him anymore. I might have to quit my only source of income so I can move in with my parents in rural Texas, where I’m certain to not find any job except maybe a gas station attendant.

I feel like such a loser. If this is the life I’m meant to live, I don’t see how it’s worth it.",10,1765982893.0,self,9,0.92,False

Lets reflect on what happened together. 



1. I firstly, felt demonic spirits attacking my emotions. A spirit of fear was trying to make me stop on my decision to go to church. So I knew this last Sunday right there that indeed God was telling me to go. Demons dont attack if there is not a threat to them.

  
2. I met a crazy man on the bus going to the church, its snowing too so keep that in mind too. As he looked sad I had my headphones on.

2.1. I felt God say invite him to church. I was like,"" Aaah man, God, come on...Ugh."" as he is about to get off I asking God for help, muster the courage somehow and say,"" Hey sorry, I felt God asking me to invite you to church.""

All hell breaks loose so to speak...Man....lol God is funny...

See I had asked God for pateince as a demon of abuse and anger has been really screwing with my emotions. 

Well lol....This ""normal"" man starts going rapid fire in how he speaks. I mean just talk talk talk talk. He says so much nonsense and gibberish and I knew there he is demon possessed. 

Kid you not he is talking about rabbits, the universe...man Lord...you funny God...

  
3. For the next.....50-1 hour and 30 minutes me and him talk on the bus then the bus stop. God is there helping me see the need and how the demons are messing with him, but God often is silent...Lol...God lol...

  
4. We eventually reach the church, leadership to my human eyes is failing. We needed some prophets and more, but God humbles me, gently, and has me seek help. Help comes, but not in the way I expected. 

5. After someone helps him as I promised the church would have coffee on the bus stop and more, (they did after I asked God like alot for help lol) we enter service.

6. I feel the need to pray over the entire church and the man. Whole service asking God to intercede, pleading blood, etc. 

7. Service ends, demon afflicted man follows me, I'm reaching a ""limit?"" ask God for help, man gets off, we say goodbye. The man is sweet dont get me wrong, but there is a repressed child spirit in him with brokenness and those who did help in the church, said it 



8. God leads me to walk after I get off the wrong bus stop. Phones not working (cut service, but usually bus wifi works, this time nope.)

9. God leads me to the downtown park, and to the stage area where homeless usually are. I meet Carlo. Carlo is homeless, has God and a ""other"" side affecting him. Said he has never had anyone come to him like that, especially snowing and more, talk to him every so he confesses his issues in general and more. 



10. After God uses me to minister to Carlo, I head home. Its all good. Then best friend in Japan, one of many best friends, calls me. God uses me to confirm what God already said....



Long story short, from....9:30 am to...? 7pm? I am ministering...



Now here we go, the big stuff; 



11. I get tempted on Monday to watch homosexual porn, which God already told me is a demon and my past from rape and more all working to tempt. Kid you not as God reminds me, talking about Sauna's and racism in Korea and Japan, with the best friend, a stay demonic thought about male private parts came, I engaged it a little first and then realized oh wow, thats a demonic attempt to make me fester on old sins.



12. I give into the porn temptation and feelings being attacked and failed to read bible. Days later, including today, God says I failed to go back to His word and was relying in a way, on Sundays stuff, and due to being drained spiritually, I failed in part due to being drained and not being re filled by God.

13. Tuesday, I give into the emotions and the feelings, due to this door opened on Monday, are stronger. Holy Spirit convicts me. I beg God to forgive me and have mercy on me I dont deserve, ""Take these demonic emotions away literally,""

God faithfully does.



14. Today, after waking up from a strange dream, (I dont remember dreams.) I call my other best friend, wish him a good marriage (he got married) and more. 

As I think about the dream Holy Spirit gets my attention. Says read His word as I tell him I feel empty.

In listening to the word as I scroll internet, I feel better.

Yet I need to clearly read His word and more and soak in His presence.



So what have we learned from my experience God allowed?



That even in the presence of God, when you are out here pouring yourself out for others, you need to go back to God. 

We cannot live off of last years or yesterdays anointing or presence of God. 

This is why God in fact if we think about it, has new mercy and new fresh anointing every day. 

We cannot live off the bread of ""this"" world, nor the bread of yesterday that came from God.

We cannot live satisfied with the old, or live as if we do not need or have needs. 



Had I refilled and tasted on God's presence, being so close to Him once again, which helped me handle the demon controlled man who kept....respectfully...yapping for 1 hour straight or more..

Had I spent time with God as I did like worship for hours, the word for hours and more, this attempt to tempt me, would have not failed.

Notice on Tuesday, despite looking at the porn, which is still sin, in me despite anything calling on God and Him showing up and saying repent and turn, when I obeyed, the power of these ""feelings"" that were sent by demonic spirits, left.



Notice today despite waking up feeling weird, I chose submission to Christ and opened that word and even in having it play and more, I felt already more full than before. 

Imagine if we strive to daily, sit with God, open His word, for a short time sit in silence like Abraham and Paul, so the Lord has time to speak and we not distracted clearly hear, imagine just how much change will come.

For those of you close, and those of you not close to God's Spirit. but especially those close to Him reading, dont get tired doing good works for the Lord, but ensure you have enough wisdom to learn the easy way.



Like for example, I've already ministered to so many people today...Its only 9:30ish am.....Guess what imma do when I post this?



Yeeaaap, Im gonna maybe grab some more hot chocolate or something, eat something, but Im truly gonna snuggle in my best, play the Word, and tell God to hold me like Im a baby or something.



And for those of you who dont know what Gods literal supernatural hugs and love feel like..Booooy, you're missing out. Ask God to show you persoanlly. its the best thing ever.



Anyways, God allows us often to face the hard way, so others learn the easy way. Its not the only reason why but a reason why often. 



So please, for anyone dealing with pride demons and ego demons? Rather than be offended, respectfully and in love go sit with the Lord and ask Him to show you Himself.

For others not facing that issue. Heed wisdom, and make sure you go sit with the Lord, in general, but especially when you spend so much time doing His will. My issue has been I neglect the spiritual energy we use when we literally are fighting demons and more...Like DUH...No wonder you feel drained bro...Duh.



Anyways, I'm out....I need a nap lol. ",2,1765982843.0,TrueChristian,0,0.75,False
1poycs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Prize-Drive1781/comments/1poycs0/are_functional_coffees_worth_the_hype_7_health/,Are Functional Coffees Worth the Hype? 7 Health Benefits You're Missing in Your Morning Cup,"Your morning coffee ritual is about to get a major upgrade. While you've been sipping your regular brew, a wellness revolution has been quietly brewing in coffee shops and kitchens across America. Enter functional coffee: the supercharged cousin of your everyday cup that's packed with health-boosting ingredients designed to do way more than just wake you up. [www.coffeeduke.com](http://www.coffeeduke.com) 

But here's the million-dollar question: Is functional coffee actually worth the hype, or is it just another wellness trend with fancy marketing? After diving deep into the science and trying countless varieties, we've got some eye-opening answers for you.

# What Exactly Is Functional Coffee?

Think of functional coffee as your regular coffee's overachieving sibling. It starts with quality coffee beans but gets supercharged with carefully selected ingredients like adaptogens, medicinal mushrooms, probiotics, vitamins, and minerals. Instead of just delivering caffeine, functional coffee creates a synergistic blend that supports multiple aspects of your health simultaneously.

The concept isn't entirely new: cultures around the world have been adding beneficial ingredients to their daily beverages for centuries. What's new is the scientific approach to combining these ingredients with coffee in precise amounts that actually make a difference.



# The 7 Game-Changing Health Benefits You're Missing

# 1. Laser-Sharp Focus Without the Crash

Regular coffee gives you a quick energy spike followed by an inevitable crash that leaves you reaching for another cup by 2 PM. Functional coffee changes this game entirely.

When coffee is enhanced with ingredients like Lion's Mane mushroom and B vitamins, you get sustained cognitive enhancement that lasts for hours. Lion's Mane specifically supports the production of nerve growth factor, which helps maintain and repair brain cells. The result? Mental clarity that doesn't fade, improved memory, and the ability to focus deeply on tasks without that jittery, scattered feeling.

# 2. Stress-Busting Superpowers

Here's where functional coffee really shines compared to regular brew. While traditional coffee can sometimes increase anxiety and stress hormones, functional varieties actually help you manage stress better.

Adaptogens like Reishi mushroom and Ashwagandha work to regulate your cortisol levels: that's your primary stress hormone. When you drink functional coffee with these ingredients, you're getting the alertness benefits of caffeine while simultaneously supporting your body's ability to handle whatever the day throws at you. It's like having a personal stress management system in your mug.

# 3. Clean, Sustained Energy All Day Long

The energy rollercoaster is real with regular coffee, but functional coffee smooths out those peaks and valleys. Medicinal mushrooms and adaptogens act as natural energy regulators, helping your body maintain steady energy levels throughout the day.

This happens because these ingredients support your adrenal system: the network responsible for managing your body's energy production. Instead of forcing a spike in energy that inevitably crashes, functional coffee works with your natural systems to provide clean, sustainable fuel.



# 4. Immune System Fortress Building

Your immune system is constantly working to protect you, and functional coffee gives it some serious backup. Mushrooms like Chaga are loaded with antioxidants: significantly more than blueberries or dark chocolate. These antioxidants help neutralize free radicals that can weaken your immune system over time.

Additionally, many functional coffees include zinc, vitamin D, and other immune-supporting nutrients that help your body build stronger defenses against illness. Think of it as daily armor for your health, delivered in the most enjoyable way possible.

# 5. Gut Health Revolution

Your digestive system does way more than just process food: it's intimately connected to your immune system, mood, and overall health. Functional coffee often includes ingredients like collagen peptides and prebiotic fibers that support a healthy gut lining and promote the growth of beneficial bacteria.

Collagen specifically helps repair and strengthen the intestinal wall, which can improve nutrient absorption and reduce inflammation throughout your body. Some functional coffees also include probiotics, giving you a daily dose of beneficial bacteria that support optimal digestive function.

# 6. Enhanced Physical Performance

Whether you're hitting the gym or just trying to keep up with daily life, functional coffee can give your physical performance a natural boost. Iron-enriched functional coffees support healthy red blood cell production, which means better oxygen transport throughout your body.

This translates to improved endurance, faster recovery, and more energy for physical activities. Some functional coffee blends also include adaptogens that help your body adapt to physical stress more efficiently, making your workouts more effective and your recovery faster.



# 7. Beauty Benefits from the Inside Out

This might be the most surprising benefit of functional coffee: many varieties can actually improve your appearance. Biotin and collagen in functional coffee support healthier skin, hair, and nails from within.

Collagen production naturally decreases as we age, leading to wrinkles, brittle nails, and thinning hair. By including collagen peptides in your daily coffee routine, you're giving your body the building blocks it needs to maintain healthy, youthful-looking skin and strong hair and nails.

# The Secret Ingredients Making It All Possible

The magic of functional coffee lies in its carefully selected ingredients. Here are the powerhouse additions that make the difference:

Medicinal Mushrooms: Lion's Mane for brain health, Reishi for stress management, Chaga for immune support, and Cordyceps for energy and endurance.

Adaptogens: Plant compounds like Ashwagandha and Rhodiola that help your body adapt to stress and maintain balance.

Probiotics: Beneficial bacteria that support digestive health and immune function.

Vitamins and Minerals: B vitamins for energy metabolism, vitamin D for immune support, iron for oxygen transport, and biotin for beauty benefits.

Collagen Peptides: Easily absorbed proteins that support skin, hair, nail, and joint health.

# Making Your Coffee More Functional at Home

You don't need to buy expensive pre-made functional coffee to get these benefits. Here are simple ways to upgrade your current coffee routine:

Start with quality coffee beans: the foundation matters. From there, you can experiment with adding a teaspoon of mushroom powder, a scoop of collagen peptides, or adaptogenic herbs to your morning brew.

Consider rotating different functional ingredients based on your needs. Feeling stressed? Add some Reishi powder. Need extra focus for a big project? Try Lion's Mane. Want to support your immune system during cold season? Chaga is your friend.

# The Bottom Line: Is It Worth the Investment?

After examining the science and benefits, functional coffee is definitely worth considering if you're looking to optimize your morning routine beyond basic caffeine consumption. The benefits are most pronounced for people seeking improved focus, stress management, sustained energy, and overall wellness support.

However, quality matters enormously. The best functional coffees use high-quality, organic coffee beans combined with properly extracted, potent functional ingredients. Cheaper versions with minimal active ingredients won't deliver the same benefits.

The investment makes sense when you consider you're replacing multiple supplements with one enjoyable daily ritual. Instead of taking separate supplements for stress, energy, immune support, and cognitive function, you're getting all these benefits in your morning cup.

# Your Next Step

Ready to upgrade your coffee game? Start by experimenting with one or two functional ingredients in your current coffee routine. Pay attention to how you feel over the course of a few weeks: the benefits of functional coffee often build over time rather than providing immediate dramatic changes.

Whether you choose to make your own functional coffee at home or explore pre-made options, you're investing in a daily habit that supports your long-term health and wellness. And honestly, if you're going to drink coffee anyway (and let's face it, you probably are), why not make it work harder for your health?

I was watching the trailer and noticed the coffee table resembled islamic Girih Tiles.  
That isn’t too surprising, given how much the kaleidoscopic Penrose pattern effect is present throughout the trailer.

But that got me thinking about Girih tiles are representations of quasicrystals:  
  
''Quasicrystals are patterns that fill all of a space but do not have the translational symmetry that is characteristic of true crystals. In two dimensions this means that sliding an exact copy of the pattern over itself will never produce an exact match''

That last part really stood out the idea that sliding one  identical copy over another never results in an exact match. It feels like a metaphor for Jesse and Dylan, two versions of the same underlying pattern, similar yet never identical.   
In the same way, the two games might be parallel worlds connected, repeating tiles in a huge Penrose patchwork, similar but not quite the same. maybe this applies to all remedy games?",90,1765982841.0,controlgame,5,1.0,False

My spouse still works. I don't have enough money to travel the world (and my kid is still at home for another year). Tried volunteering and I wouldn't say this out loud but I hated it. 

People say to get hobbies but I've never had any outside of hiking and biking. Work was a very big part of my life and satisfied my need to be creative. 

I love music and try to listen to a new album every day. No desire to learn an instrument.

Yes, I read but you can't do that all day. 

I walk the dog and take him to the dog park, where I chat aimlessly for a bit. 

I joined a gym and have started to play pickle ball during the day. Where I live people are known to be very standoffish so maybe if I go regularly for 6 months or so I'll have earned the right to ask if anyone wants to go out for coffee afterwards. 

I ride my bike with a club full of much older retirees in good weather. 

I probably see one friend a week and the rest is keeping up by text, which is pretty unsatisfying now that I have all this free time. And yes, I'd love to make more friends but that's not so easy when you are retired and not involved in a hobby. 

Can anyone suggest a few common hobbies that seem to be popular with a lot of people like pickle ball? I don't like crafts. I feel like maybe I retired too early but in my field, there's really no going back. I do pick up a bit of contract work here and there for a few hours a week but that's not helping much to fill my time in an enjoyable and stimulating way. Maybe I just have to wait it out until I slow down enough for all of the above to be enough and my friends retire?

Our game, The Corner Cafe, is a cozy cafe simulator set in a Mythical version of Ireland in 2160.

The goal of the game is to create an oasis of community in a dystopia.

You'll get to make and serve coffees and different types of food (chicken fillet rolls to start...), you'll get to customize your cafe and you'll get to change your outfits to better suit your own style! 

You'll also get to explore the city and meet all it's strange inhabitants (like Fomorians, Tuatha Dé Danann, Banshees). If you help them you'll be able to unlock new upgrades and customization options for your cafe. 

We have been hard at work on this for a long time now, we're a two person team so it can be fairly overwhelming, but the support we've gotten so far from folks has been absolutely amazing!

1poy9tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/1poy9tx/police_called_on_customer_twice_within_48_hours/,Police called on customer twice within 48 hours.. help!,"hi fort collins subreddit, wanted to share an experience i’ve had twice now with this community in the hopes of someone having some information about this individual OR to see if other businesses around town have experienced this as well.

TLDR: Customer has come in twice within the last 2 days dropping f-bombs left and right and threatening staff and customers. Sharing my “unpunctuated rant” of an experience with him and pleading for information. Thanks 🩷

i work at a locally owned and operated coffee shop. on Sunday, quite early in the morning, we had a customer be so rude and abrasive to our customers that some of our patrons called the cops on him. It was only when he was threatened with the police that he did leave, and we were informed by our guests that he used language that was entirely inappropriate and so scary that they were in fear for not only their safety, but the safety of me and my coworker who’d opened that morning. Since the police were called, we told our manager (who was not present at the time) and tried to continue on with our day as best we could.

My coworker and I who’d experienced this first-hand shared relevant information with everyone else who works FOH, including his name which I grabbed from our transaction history from the card he’d used to pay, along with a description of his appearance. For the sake of not doxxing him, I’ll only share that his name is Ramesh and his last name begins with the letter “N” (I’m not entirely convinced that this individual didn’t steal this card from someone else, so I hesitate to share all the information I have in case someone innocent is somehow involved.).

Monday after this had happened, I’m working with my same coworker and I make the off-hand comment: “what if he comes back?” and we laugh it off because we think there’s absolutely no way he’d come back after the shit he pulled the preceding morning. Well, what do you know, Tuesday morning the two of us are opening again and guess who shows up? Now, at this point, I’m on edge. I serve him (every time he’s ever come in, including before Sunday when he suddenly decided to start acting like he’d had a mental health crisis, he’s gotten a large drip coffee and specified “an inch of room.” Usually people aren’t that specific, so I recognize and remembered that) and this time he pays with cash. I give him his change (keep in mind on this Tuesday, it’s around 7:30 similarly to Sunday’s incident, and by nature we don’t have everyone on the clock at that time but rather a few individuals until we get reinforcements around 8) and he goes off to the lobby. At this point, everyone who is on the clock knows about this individual because of Sunday, so we make an agreement to one-by-one do lobby sweeps to make sure this guy isn’t terrorizing our customers. Maybe Sunday was just a bad day for him? We do so for a while and he seems to be keeping to himself, but then after 20 or so minutes he begins his antics once again: speaking to other customers unwarranted and using threatening language. At this point a more senior coworker from BOH confronts him, and the thing is is that he just wouldn’t leave. He directed all of his attention to her and argued, cursed, and said horrific things to her in front of our customers. Finally she’s calling the police and that’s when he actually leaves, and the encounter was so outlandish and actually infuriating that I am incredibly upset. My coworkers have felt unsafe because of him and I worry he’s driving away our customers, especially those early-bird regulars I as an individual and we as a business have built relationships with.

So, that’s the story, and probably more information than y’all require, though when I read others’ experiences I like to have some context and additional facts just to better understand the situation. I hope yall feel that way too! I will say that I have been doing my own research to see where this individual’s name shows up, and I have found a ratemyprofessor page for him at CSU as a professor of mathematics. However, far as I can tell, he hasn’t worked at the school since 2019. I have not yet been able to find a picture of him online, which makes me hesitate to share his full name and gives me reason to doubt that his name really is Ramesh N., but he does appear to be of Indian descent. He’s around 6’1”-6-3”, appearing between 40-50 years old, with black hair with gray streaks, and his clothing is disheveled. If y’all work in food and have experienced him, I really want to know. And if you have any information concerning more information on him in any capacity I’d be glad to have it. I’ve left some details out of my story, but if additional context is what you need I’d be happy to answer direct comms concerning where exactly this happened or if you’d like me to share his full last name with you personally.

This is a great community, and one I’m very proud to be a part of. I want to keep my coworkers and our flock of customers safe from people like this, but i also want this individual to receive help because he desperately needs it.

I was born in the US to parents who came here from Mexico chasing a better future my dad literally jumped the border cutting his hands on the way so his kids could have opportunities he never had he walked into a Jack in the Box washed the blood from his hands and with his last dollar bought a coffee accidentally pouring salt instead of sugar when he told me that story as a kid something lit inside me that’s never gone out

We grew up with bars on our windows money was tight but my parents gave everything they had in middle school my dad would skip his own lunch so he could bring it to me that kind of sacrifice shaped everything about who I am

My first job was running a forklift in a cheese factory no license just hustle I worked 5 am to 2 pm for 10 dollars an hour cash doing whatever it took to help my family and save a few dollars

Then in high school I stumbled onto TikTok videos of people making thousands trading stocks in minutes I was hooked that curiosity turned into late night study sessions blown accounts and more lessons than I can count

There were painful moments like losing 30k shortly after losing my mom but my dad’s words kept me going never give up on your dreams

Patience became my edge while most traders chased every move I learned to wait for the setups that mattered fewer trades bigger conviction real consistency

Money and power aren’t what drive me impact is I want as many people as possible to experience the freedom I’ve found and to show that no matter where you start your story can be extraordinary 

This is only the beginning

So I (31F) am being called selfish and an AH by part of my family, and I genuinely don’t know if I’m missing something or if this has just become a family-wide fixation.

For context, I’m one of six grandchildren on my paternal grandmother’s side. She’s very much the matriarch of the family and what she says goes. The order goes: my male cousin “R” (the oldest), my older sibling, two female cousins (the oldest of whom I’ll call “L”), then me, then my younger sibling. We all grew up very close.

My husband and I started dating when I was 15 and he was 18. When I was 22, he proposed. That December, we gave the whole family a save-the-date for our wedding the following year. Everyone knew our date well in advance.

A few months after we got engaged (before the save-the-date), my oldest cousin R started dating “A.” They got engaged quickly. After the engagement, A’s behavior toward me changed instantly. When no one was around, she’d say things like how I had the “audacity” to get engaged before R because he was the oldest grandchild. She told me she’d make sure they got married before we did and a lot more along those lines. I thought it was bizarre, but I didn’t engage with it. Our date was set for later that year. It wasn’t a competition to me.

They announced their wedding would be the weekend before ours. I honestly thought it was convenient because family traveling from out of town could attend both and make a week trip of it. During their engagement, A constantly bragged about how much money R was spending on their wedding. Ours was very DIY, mostly donated services, and cost us the bare minimum. I didn’t care about the comparison, but she clearly did. She made comments like ""that would look cheap,"" and she'd ""never have a wedding like that."" Even said things like during my wedding.

At their wedding, when I went to congratulate them, she hugged me, dug her nails into my back, and whispered that she couldn’t believe I was “forcing” her to cut her honeymoon short to attend my wedding. I pulled back and told her she chose her date knowing mine, and if she didn’t want to come to my wedding, she didn’t have to. My grandmother, who only heard my comment, told me I was being very disrespectful to uninvite them from my wedding at their wedding, in front of everyone. I tried to explain to her, but she refused to hear it.

After that, my female cousin L (who I’d been close to growing up) went basically radio silent with me. No explanation. Just cold distance. I figured it was due to the comment misunderstanding by our grandmother.

Years later, I had my first child. No drama at that point. Four years after that, I announced I was pregnant with my second. L blew up at me. Apparently, she was two months ahead of me in her first pregnancy, and she accused me of “taking away her moment” and said I’d done the same thing to her brother with the weddings. The thing is… I didn’t know she was pregnant, because we hadn’t spoken since the weddings.

Fast-forward to this year. I’m pregnant with my third and final child. Once again, L is pregnant too and we were due about two weeks apart.

This time, it escalated. L and even my grandmother started saying I’m selfish, doing it on purpose, and refusing to “let my cousins have their moments.” Half the family is acting like I plan my pregnancies around L’s life. The other half says I should keep my announcements to myself to avoid upsetting her. Like what? It's not like I phoned her and asked, ""Oh, btw, are you and your husband trying to get pregnant tonight?""

I gave birth to a healthy baby two days after L did. Her baby was born with a shoulder dislocation that needed gentle reduction under anesthesia to put it back in place, and the doctors expect a full recovery. It's still scary and stressful as a parent. I'd be a wreck if it were my baby, but I didn’t know any of this when I posted, because no one had told me.

I posted a birth announcement on social media. Just a couple of photos, the baby’s name, and that we were both doing well.

L and A messaged and my grandmother phoned me furious, demanding I take the photos down. They said I’m “taking away her moment,” that I always do this and that everyone is supposed to be focused on L and her baby right now, and that my posts are attention-seeking and cruel because her baby is struggling. L said I’m making people congratulate me when they should be checking on her and that I'm an AH for always needing to compete with her and her brother. My grandmother told me I'm disowned. Not the first time she has used that line...

I feel awful that she and her baby are dealing with this. If I’d known before posting, I probably would’ve waited a bit out of basic sensitivity, but I don't even have A, R, or L on my social media. I blocked A and R after my wedding and L after the previous pregnancy. I also left the family group chat at that time. My parents were the ones to share a screenshot of my post in the chat. 

I also don’t think it’s fair to erase my baby’s birth announcement or pretend my child doesn’t exist because of what L is going through. Especially when L has cut contact with me for years and only reaches out to accuse me of “stealing” her moments. 

Now family members are messaging me saying I should just take it down “to keep the peace,” that I’m selfish for not prioritizing L’s feelings, and that I’m causing drama at the worst possible time.

So AITA for refusing to take down my newborn photos because my cousin says I’m stealing her moment?",2,1765982607.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

My boyfriend loves the pods & usually will brew a lungo. I prefer espresso & will occasionally use my aero press or do I'll pour over if I want a big cup

At my office we have the fancy breville with the digital screen that's pretty automatic ( but $800) and now I enjoy making coffee with a porta filter! 

If anyone can help me find a good but fairly priced machine that can pull both espresso & longer lungo shots. We're open to grinding our own beans but would love if we could pour the beans into the machine like the breville I use at work.

I think she does this because to her fighting is a form of staying connected. I’ve seen this pattern more now that I’m better at grey rocking but if I were to tell an outsider they’d look at me like you’re overreacting/crazy. Would this count as being passive aggressive or is there another word for it?

This my mom does perfectly because it’s happened with other people in her life too and then she says they’re just so crazy because of how they react while she stays calm/less angry. I think it also works to get the reactive party angrier because it’s just a mind twist. I’ve been to therapy where I couldn’t explain this well because I didn’t know she had bpd nor what to call this. I really thought I was just the whole problem as she made me believe but I notice she does this to me and other people. She gets angrier if you don’t fall for the bait and keep trying. She sometimes will get outright angry but with grey rock she doesn’t show it to me as much anymore since I don’t react.

For example yesterday the coffee machine was broken and I had to leave to go get coffee. She just had left so I called her asking if she was going to get coffee. She said no she’s going to the gym and so I said are you going for a training session or just randomly. She then was like who cares if I’m going just randomly and yes it’s for a set time. This she said in her angry tone. I told her if it’s not set you can stop to get me coffee first. I didn’t fall for this first try. 

She then comes back and I ask her again to use the car which she says no she’s going somewhere else. She doesn’t even mention that I need coffee which if it were the other way around would be a huge issue. She also does this fake nice act here. This is the second try at the fight. I say ok can you drop me off at the coffee shop (grey rock). She agrees. 

I get in the car and I see a coffee cup that she got herself but got none for me. She looks at it then at me and I just show no expression. That was the last try at the fight. If I explain this to someone else I seem like the crazy one. She has done this forever and it’s only because of time that I’ve been able to figure it out. It’s so exhausting and messes with my head. I spent a lot of time after trying to get back to normal and stayed away from her.

We've had ongoing issues with his family's lack of boundaries, especially since his parents' messy divorce 6 months ago.

When his dad kicked everyone out, I agreed to temporarily house Jack's siblings - his sister Lily (29F) and brother Max (25M). It was supposed to be a few weeks max, but it turned into 2 months of hell.

They constantly invaded our privacy - using our en-suite bathroom instead of the guest one, napping in our bed, eating my special snacks, using my home office for hours. I repeatedly asked Jack to set boundaries, but he brushed it off saying they were going through a tough time.

Even after they moved out, they kept showing up unannounced at all hours. I'd come home to find them lounging on the couch, feet on the coffee table, acting like they owned the place. Jack always let them in, no matter how many times I told him it made me uncomfortable.

Last week, I got home after a stressful 12-hour shift to find Lily's car parked right in front of our garage, blocking me in. Inside, she was sprawled on our couch watching TV. I saw red.

I stormed into our bedroom, grabbed a suitcase, and started packing my essentials. Jack ran in, begging me to calm down and talk it out. In front of Lily, I snapped. I told him I was done, that I couldn't live like this anymore, feeling disrespected and suffocated in my own home. I said I wanted a divorce.

Jack looked stunned. Lily quickly left. I finished packing and went to stay with a friend. Jack has blown up my phone since, pleading for another chance, saying he'll finally set firm boundaries. But I'm just so tired. Tired of not being a priority, tired of having my needs trampled by his family.

I'm wondering though, AIW for blurting out that I wanted a divorce in the heat of the moment, in front of his sister? Should I have waited to have that conversation in private, once I was calm? I never meant for it to go down like that, but I just snapped after months of built-up resentment.",0,1765982450.0,amiwrong,13,0.32,False

I called Provisions Market on 5th Street and spoke directly with the general manager because ICE agents have been regularly sitting inside, drinking coffee. I called yesterday when they were physically there because we had just verified.

I asked her plainly if they’re okay hosting ICE.

Her response: they have “been coming here for a while,” she’s “personally spoken to them,” and they told her they’re “not the ones taking people off the streets.”

I told her clearly: that’s not true. Community verifiers have observed their involvement in street-level detentions and rights violations. These are the same operations a federal judge (Judge Aiken) has had to step in on with a temporary restraining order.

Then I asked for the bare minimum: if you’re going to allow ICE to sit in your space, will you at least make it visibly clear that immigrants are welcome? Will you put up a sign that says “Immigrants are welcome here”?

She said immigrants are welcome — but when I asked for a sign, she refused and said it was “above my call as the general manager.”

So here’s what that means in practice: they’re willing to provide comfort and normalcy to ICE, but they won’t take even the simplest public step to reassure immigrant community members who have every reason to feel unsafe around that.

I told her I would share this with the community. I am.

I won’t spend another dollar there. I used to go about twice a week because it’s close to my work. Not anymore. If you don’t want your money helping normalize ICE’s presence in our community, act accordingly.

If folks want to share businesses that have taken clear, public steps to support immigrant neighbors, drop them below.",219,1765982381.0,Eugene,46,0.88,False

Day 14,800

Two years have passed since the marriage and the finalization of the Slingshot Trajectory. We are now ten years away from the galactic core.

Life on the ship has settled into a rhythm of peace and routine. The Hybrid Trajectory requires constant, but manageable, course corrections, which I manage seamlessly now. The pilots—Ryu, Miller, and the others—are confident. The Haven Ring is thriving.

Our quiet life with Tori became even fuller a year ago with the arrival of Elias.

Elias was a child born to a young couple in the Haven Ring who, tragically, were lost in a non-critical maintenance accident—a routine thermal vent purge that went wrong. The communal structure of our society meant Elias needed a family, and Tori and I didn't hesitate.

Elias is three now, and he is a glorious, noisy chaos. He is the first person in our quarters who doesn't work a shift or analyze a data point. His primary concern is whether the nutrient paste is the right shade of green, and he calls the FTL streak outside the viewport ""the long blue tunnel.""

""You're going to break the thermal sensor again, Elias,"" I cautioned this morning, pulling him away from the reactor temperature display on my console.

""Tori says things are supposed to grow!"" he insisted, trying to poke the screen.

""This is not a plant, buddy. This is what makes the blue tunnel go.""

I looked at Tori, who was packing our bags for a weekend trip to the farm sector. She was already covered in a light layer of soil. She looks at Elias with the same intense devotion she shows her struggling Ky’lar crops—patient, nurturing, and utterly committed to his survival.

Our relationship isn't a passionate supernova anymore; it’s a bedrock. It’s coming home to a house that smells like alien earth and synthetic baby formula, and knowing that both the life and the house are safe.

Day 14,805

August is happy. Shockingly so.

He married Mina, one of Tori’s lead bio-technicians. I realized they were serious when August started volunteering for maintenance duty in the hydroponics bay—a sector he had previously avoided due to the humidity.

They’ve moved into a large, family-sized cabin in the Haven Ring, which August meticulously insulated himself. He now spends his free time building Elias wooden block toys from recycled composite hull material.

""The structural integrity is flawless,"" he declared yesterday, showing off his latest creation—a block FTL ship. ""No sharp edges. I'm prioritizing safety over aerodynamics.""

""You built an entire block set to distract yourself from the Black Hole maneuver, didn't you?"" I teased.

He just shrugged, adjusting the frames of his glasses. ""The math is settled, June. Now it's about life. Mina is talking about having a child. The ship has room, the farm has food, and the life support is stable. What else is there to worry about?""

He’s right. The worries have shifted from existential dread to domestic bliss. The ship is finally fulfilling its purpose: it has become a home.

Day 14,820

I found Dad in his usual spot this morning, the viewport seat in the old mess hall, sipping coffee. He looked tired. More tired than just the chronic exhaustion of a retired Pilot.

""Morning, Dad,"" I said, sitting opposite him. ""Anything interesting in the view?""

""The same blue streak, June,"" he murmured, his eyes unfocused. ""But the light's different today. I think the core is making the sky a little bit yellower.""

""That's just the old window sealant,"" I chuckled, but something in his tone concerned me. He was always acutely aware of the smallest change in the ship or the view.

""I’m tired,"" he repeated, leaning his head back. ""More tired than before the launch.""

Day 14,825

He collapsed during lunch.

It wasn't a sudden, dramatic failure—just a quiet slip from his chair in the mess hall. August and I rushed him to the medical bay in the main ring.

The ship's chief medical officer, Dr. Chen, is a fourth-generation crewmember, brilliant but young. After three hours of scanning and testing, she called Mom, August, and me into the sterile consultation room.

""Senior Pilot's original generation was never meant for this duration of FTL travel,"" Dr. Chen began, her voice professionally subdued. ""His primary organs are failing. It's not one thing; it's cumulative systems degradation. We've done everything the Earth archives specified for long-term deep-space radiation exposure. The stress has been building for nearly forty years.""

""Can you fix it?"" Mom asked, her voice cracking.

Dr. Chen shook her head slowly. ""I can stabilize him. But I can't reverse the decay. The damage is extensive. We can make him comfortable, but... I don't believe he will survive the next few weeks.""

The news hit me with the force of a simulated gravity spike. For all my life, my father was the rock, the Founder, the man who knew how to fly the impossible. He was the one who recorded the logs, the one who retired, the one who was supposed to watch us make the final burn.

August gripped my shoulder, his face pale. ""He can't go now. We need him for the Black Hole. He needs to see us succeed.""

But I looked at the young doctor, at the grim look in her eyes, and I knew the terrible truth. The first generation was built to launch the ship. It was never guaranteed to see the destination. The fear I had reserved for the Black Hole suddenly found a terrible, immediate target.

I walked back to my shift on the bridge. Elias was sleeping peacefully in our cabin, Tori having promised to pick him up after her night watch. The FTL streak rushed past the window.

I pulled up the Pilot's Log.

Day 14,825.

Time to Black Hole: 9 Years, 10 Months.

Status: Senior Pilot Vitals: Critical. Mission Status: Unchanged. Personal Log: I am afraid.

1poy2jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1poy2jl/muscle_fatigue_and_low_energy/,Muscle fatigue and low energy,"Somewhere around mid-high school, I started noticing that my arms and legs would get sore and tired very quickly. This happened while biking and exercising, and I was constantly exhausted, often falling asleep during classes despite trying to stay awake.

Nowadays, it affects everyday life. Walking up stairs or working with my arms above shoulder height makes my muscles feel like they have no energy, forcing me to rest. Even at work this physically holds me back after screwing above my head, I often need to lower my arms for a few seconds before I can continue. 

When I wake up, my back and chest feel quickly fatigued and sore, often with a mild feeling of breath hunger or oxygen shortage. 

I also have frequent muscle twitches. People notice that I sigh sometimes and think I’m irritated, but I feel like I’m just trying to get enough air.

I struggle heavily with concentration at work, to the point where colleagues notice it. Coffee helps somewhat. I fall asleep suddenly during meetings, lessons, or while using public transport, even in noisy environments. It comes on abruptly. I’ve also had derealisation since primary school.

At some point, I became afraid I had a muscle or neuromuscular disease. After seeing many doctors, I was referred to the hospital. EMGs of my limbs, respiratory tests, and extensive blood work all came back normal.

Recently, I was tested for chronic hyperventilation and scored 100% on all parts; my carbon dioxide levels were clearly too low. This surprised me, as I never noticed myself hyperventilating. I’ve always known I have social anxiety, sometimes severe, but I never expected it to impact my physical health this much.

I’m still unsure whether all of this can be explained by chronic hyperventilation. At the same time, I’m at least somewhat relieved, and even a bit glad that there is finally something that has been diagnosed.

My avoidant ex of a year ended things with a discard, refused to talk about it and avoided me in person when we had to meet. This was at the end of last year. And it was super stressful and difficult for me because we still had projects and work together, so that’s why I still had to see him from time to time.

There were also a few confusing things that happened after the break up. He gave me back my things after I asked for them, but included some gifts with my stuff when he brought it back. Which felt like mixed messages to me. He would also still be hot and cold, greeting me sometimes and acting like I didn’t exist at other times. Inviting me to group things after work and then uninviting me at the last minute. Sending me a message that he wanted to move on and keep contact to the bare minimum, and then deliberately making an effort to have a conversation with me in person when I was respecting his request for distance.

All of these things left me feeling really confused. I obviously didn’t want the breakup in the first place and I still loved him so it was hard to let go. I was dating and seeing someone new but every time I saw my ex, the hot and cold behaviour really affected me and it put a strain on my new relationship. I eventually ended it because I didn’t think it was fair to the other person.

Finally, I also decided to leave that workplace because it was just too stressful for me. I asked to say goodbye to him before I left (nothing dramatic, just coffee or even a brief chat). He said that’s fine we can do that, and then the week I was leaving and we were supposed to meet, I texted to plan the meet-up and he had blocked me. 

After leaving, I still struggled so much to let go and move on. 

I knew that I didn’t want to be with him. He wasn’t a good partner to me. He used to ghost me for days after a good date or a fun weekend. And he even said we couldn’t see each other on weekends anymore after a period of things going really well. He would constantly criticise me and point out my flaws, he never gave compliments. He liked to act like he didn’t care and didn’t need me. He walked ahead of me in public and didn’t hold my hand. He also did this really weird thing where he couldn’t say my name if I was there. And he never addressed me as anything. He once even wrote me a card and didn’t address it to me! It just started with the message, but he still signed it with his name at the end. This was of course, interspersed with love bombing and such, which is why I kept going back and forth over leaving. And he had also told mutual friends that he really liked me and wanted to get married one day. Which kept me in the relationship and waiting for things to improve.

But even though I knew I could find someone who treated me better, and that I would even be better off single, my attachment system was still really activated. I kept replaying conversations and interactions over and over again in my mind, trying to figure out where things went wrong. I would dream about him often and wake up feeling dysregualted and in tears sometimes. I would feel an urgent need to reach out to him just to have a final, positive interaction, or to check his social media and see what he was up to. Even though I resisted doing those things for the most part, the urge was there almost daily. 

After a few months of this, he unblocked me and sent me a message by mistake, so I sent him a message just to wish him well. He read it but he ignored it and didn’t reply. And I was so confused. I just didn’t understand why things couldn’t be okay between us. I had accepted the discard and his not wanting to speak after, I had let him go and moved on, I had respected his requests for space and minimal contact. I basically gave him everything he wanted. And he had unblocked me so I thought sending him a message or having a little contact would be okay. 

Anyway, months after my last message, he texted me on my birthday. Nothing special, just “happy birthday, enjoy it.” And it was like the final piece my nervous system and brain needed to close the loop. After that, I finally saw the relationship and him for what they truly were. No putting him on a pedestal anymore. No more ruminating, no dreams. The urge to check up on him was gone, the urge to have contact was gone too. I’ve been feeling happy and calm and like my old self since then. His message wasn’t anything special, but just that bit of neutral contact, not hostile, not love-bombing or bread-crumbing, was enough for my mind to let it go and close the loop.

I think a lot of avoidants misunderstand their ex’s feelings after being discarded with no explanation, or after being ghosted. They’re not reaching out because they still love you or are trying to convince you to take them back. It’s that they’re struggling to close the loop in their mind. Because the ending was so sudden and unexplained. Because it’s human nature to obsess over a thing that’s still “open”. Because they really loved you and they wanted to let go with love, not blocking or avoidance or ghosting. I know avoidants complain about people not leaving them alone when it’s clearly “done”. But for the other person, it may not be so clear. You know why you ended it but you never told them. It came out of the blue for them or they were just ghosted. It’s hard to understand that and manage it, when you don’t have avoidance to lean on to take the pain or thoughts away. 

I used to be severely avoidant leaning. I don’t think was ever as severe as this recent ex, but I also used to unknowingly use avoidance as a way to cope with overwhelming feelings or situations. At the time, I thought I was being emotionally mature. I also ended things with a discard (although I didn’t realise it at the time) with a different ex in the past. I reached out to him after this whole thing to apologise because I finally experienced the pain he did, and I understood why he had needed to talk after things ended. And I think he honestly was waiting for that contact even after all this time. Not to get back together, but to close the loop. 

So there’s no judgement. Just something for people to consider. You don’t lose anything by being kind to someone after a breakup.

Obviously this doesn’t apply to exes who are being abusive, stalking you, disregarding your boundaries etc. And also to be clear, ghosting is not setting a boundary. It’s normal to want to talk after a breakup, even if you respect the other person’s choice to end the relationship. ",1,1765982110.0,Disorganized_Attach,1,0.6,False

It went viral.,"Sports Drink, a coffee shop and comedy club in Uptown New Orleans, temporarily closed on Tuesday after a video circulated on social media showing employees confronting law enforcement agents whom they believed to be with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill later confirmed the agents to be members of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, which was in the area to arrest a man on 120 counts of possession of child sexual abuse material involving children under the age of 13.

The video, posted on X by Libs of TikTok, a popular right-wing account, shows law enforcement agents standing outside a Breaux Mart grocery store as protesters accuse them of being with ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

In the video, which had garnered 1.7 million views by Tuesday night, two agents deny being associated with ICE and say they are with the ICAC task force. The protestors express skepticism, with one woman saying, “I don’t really buy that,” as another person adds, “We don’t respect whatever you do.”

A screenshot shared in the comments shows Sports Drink responding to the video and mocking its appearance on the Libs of TikTok page. The business later released several statements on Instagram, writing that “pro-ICE sycophants are negatively reviewing us on Google” and encouraging followers to report the reviews and leave positive ones instead.

Hours later, Sports Drink announced on Instagram that it would temporarily close.

“We care about the safety of our employees, patrons, and community at large and want to operate with an abundance of caution,” the post reads. “Thank you to everyone who has shown us support and passion. We truly appreciate it.”

The business’ public Instagram and X accounts were later made private. The owner could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon.

In a press release dated Dec. 12, Murrill alleged that the agents were “harassed, cursed, and chased through neighborhoods” by protestors during and after the execution of a search warrant for Jiaxin Tian, 29, who was arrested at his home on Coliseum Street in the Touro neighborhood.

Tian, a Chinese national who has been in the United States on an academic visa since 2021, was transported to the Orleans Parish jail for booking, according to Murrill’s office. His bond status was not immediately available and the investigation is ongoing.

“Our office will investigate any attempts to harm or obstruct our agents for doing their jobs in taking child sex predators off the streets,” Murrill said. “This behavior will not be tolerated.”

The confrontation occurred amid heightened tensions in New Orleans following the arrival of Border Patrol agents in early December as part of a federal enforcement effort known as “Catahoula Crunch,” an operation the Trump administration has said is intended to increase deportations nationwide.

Immigration advocates and some local officials, including Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, have criticized the sweeps and their tactics. The operation has also drawn criticism from state officials, including Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, who said the enforcement actions have ignited fear among residents and disrupted the state’s labor force.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander overseeing the operation, said this week that the Louisiana sweeps had led to nearly 350 people being detained. The Department of Homeland Security said last week that the operation had so far resulted in 250 arrests.

Federal arrest records indicate that fewer than 10% of those detained have prior criminal histories. Those range from serious crimes, such as aggravated kidnapping, to less serious offenses like public urination.

Officials have said the goal of the operation is to detain 5,000 people. In recent days, the effort has expanded to Baton Rouge.",66,1765982103.0,NewOrleans,62,0.87,False

There’s no way her wings had spice. I’ve seen so many men and women sweat their eyeballs out during the last 4. People are so delusional. They say: “maybe she has a high tolerance, it’s not about size”, but there’s no way Ariana has high tolerance to spice, why? Cause she’s a basic bitch from boca raton who can’t stop reminding people she’s “Italian”, Italians have some spicy food, but it’s not as often or as spicy as other cuisines. And she doesn’t eat (ENOUGH everyday) to ever build up enough tolerance to hot food. We have seen her food; it’s all kale salads and raw tofu and coffee, who the fuck does she think she’s fooling. I don’t think she’s ever been photographed eating spicy wings, or a fucking wrap ever. And suddenly she can withstand Da Bomb with zero effort. 

I’m actually kind of disappointed on the whole production and in Sean, because the whole point of the show it’s how raw it is, and how celebrities make a mess of themselves and struggle through, while simultaneously having to give an interview. And they fucking sold their integrity for an interview with Ariana so she wouldn’t look like a mess on camera and would look like a champion of spicy food.

1poxyg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1poxyg5/reintroducing_free_at_sea_plus/,(Re)introducing Free at Sea Plus!,"This post is timed to coincide with the NCL embargo on this information (9:30 AM, December 17, 2025). I'll be in a training class at this time, but will try to answer questions as able.

DISCLAIMER: I wrote most of this, but the comparison table is AI-generated. I've checked it for accuracy (and found many mistakes/hallucinations; it invented an entire package on Celebrity that doesn't exist! Don't worry, I fixed it to the best of my abiltiy), but don't come after me if it's slightly wrong, especially for other lines! :D

Well, after a brief hiatus, NCL has finally reintroduced Free at Sea Plus! When I first saw the details of this latest incarnation, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! This provides a TON of value and should pretty much sell itself.

# What's Included?

So now, the deets! It's $49.99 per person per day for the first two guests in the cabin (for the most part, more on that later - there are scenarios where the price changes, always lower!) and includes:

* Top-shelf liquors (the examples used in the NCL marketing materials are Patrón Añejo, The Macallan 12 YO and more). I take it to mean that everything that was an upcharge that's served by the glass is now included.
* Premium wines and champagne by the glass (""with over 50 labels from our signature collection"") as well as 40% off of other bottles, flights, and tasting experiences. Side note: I highly recommend the Johnnie Walker Experience. I've done it on a few cruises and it's AWESOME!
* All Starbucks coffee and specialty coffees from both Starbucks locations and restaurants (one drink per visit, 30 minute waiting period between drinks)
* Energy drinks and fresh juices (I take it that this means Red Bull. The Pure energy drinks should continue to be included with base FAS)
* Unlimited open bar at GSC (where applicable)
* Bottled water at the bar and premium bottled water in restaurants (I take it that this means that Acqua Panna and San Pelogrino will no longer be available at bars like it was with the old P+ package sometimes)
* Your existing Free at Sea specialty dining meals, and 50% off the cover charges of any additional meals.
* Unlimited streaming WiFi (1 device per guest at a time) - upgraded from Basic WiFi in the old FAS+!
* Daily service charge is included (NEW!)

# True Cost Context

Free at Sea Plus is an add-on. If you already have Free at Sea (the numbers are slightly different for More at Sea, which this can also be added to):

Beverage gratuities: $28.50/day

Specialty dining: $20 per meal (varies by cruise length)

Add Plus: $49.99/day Blended daily cost: \~$78.49 + dining spread across cruise length (Example: 7-night cruise with 3 specialty meals = \~$87/day per person)

# When can this be booked?

This will be available for booking tomorrow, December 18, and applies to cruises departing on or after February 1, 2026. It can ONLY be booked if you already have the base Free at Sea or More at Sea package with the beverage and dining options (your confirmation will have promo codes ALL4CHO or ALL4CHO2). It is applicable to all stateroom categories, including sailaway categories.

Note that it's also applicable to group bookings, even though you may have different promo codes (for affinity groups, you need Group A amenities, for example).

This may be booked up to 72 hours prior to sailing. Reservations made within the 72-hour window are not eligible.

# But you said earlier there were some situations where the price changed! What are those?

There are two situations where the price changes:

* If guests 1 or 2 is a child (under 21), they receive a modified version at $40/day.
   * If the child is ages 3-12, they get prepaid service charges and streaming WiFi.
   * If the child is 13-20, they get the above plus the 50% off specialty dining.
* Combinable with the above, if you already have prepaid service charges through a promotion, you receive a discount of $15/day on the package price. (you will have promo code FASUPGRD on your reservation in this case).
   * NOTE: the materials state that either if you have already paid them or have them via a promotion. It makes no sense to take this discount if you've already prepaid service charges (since those are $20-25/day), because they can be removed and this package added.

The promo code for the base FAS+ package with DSC is FASUPDSC (you'll see this in the upper right of your reservation)

# Where can I get more information

You can find a comparison of the base Free at Sea and Free at Sea Plus [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bzg1zeX2uNQFwSlX-B2-k64BU88YPq60/view?usp=drive_link).

# When do I have to pay?

Free at Sea Plus is payable immediately upon addition to the reservation.

1poxw55,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PublicLobster16/comments/1poxw55/am_i_wrong_for_yelling_at_my_neighbour/,Am I wrong for yelling at my neighbour?,"Im normally quiet with my past, I wouldn’t usually go around telling the whole internet about my problems, but now I have no one else to talk to so why not. I only talked about my problems to my friend, who I’ve known my entire life and our families were crazy close like family close. Our parents were friends since Highschool and always promised to live close to each other. I was born in Britain then when my younger brother was born we moved to America and when my sister was born we moved to Australia, my friend Noah and his family moved with us and we eventually became neighbours. Noah had a sister one year younger than him and another sister the same age as my brother. I also have this large red diary that has been with me forever, I write my days and feelings in there and before I could write my mother wrote in it for me which was pretty sweet.

Fast forward, I moved into a new neighbourhood to try and forget about my past, Noah moved with me but we didn't live as close, still a walkable distance though. So anyways i never really talked to my neighbours much, I didn’t want to be apart of their lives they were kinda just there. Most of them probably didn’t actually know my real name, or my origin. They'd just call me Mike and get confused when someone mentions Michael but I’d rather keep it that way.



There was this girl, Kayleigh who lived on the side my house, she tried so hard to get me to like her but I got be honest, i still wasn’t over this girl from Highschool. I’ve had a lot of girls-and guys like me, I have brown hair, blue eyes, freckles and in Highschool almost all the girls were crushing on me. Kayleigh was a spoiled brat, exactly Ike Noah’s sister. She started following me wherever I went. From my local coffee shop to my job, I was getting freaked out. She’d even leave flowers or chocolates on my door but I just returned them or threw them out in the bin. 



Now here’s the thing from my past, I was in a car crash when I was 5 years old. I was in the car with my uncle, I don’t exactly remember what happened but I do remember the car turning and we crashed down into these bushes and trees. I opened my eyes, the car was burning and my uncle was trapped. I tried to let him free but he told me to go. I climbed up the hill onto the road and starting waving at cars and screaming until someone stopped and called 911. You might think thats all the deaths I’ve seen in my life, but it’s not.



A couple weeks later, my dad was acting more different towards me, and he started abusing me. He called me weak, he left scars that are still here to this day, and yet I still loved him. I still swore I could make him change, all the way throughout my life I thought that. When I turned 16, is when my life changed. My father was neglectful, even towards my little 5 year old sister. She tried everything to make him proud, but he was too busy in his work to even look at her. He‘d grab her drawings toss them it the bin, yell at her and sometimes even slap her. But the worst part? He made me feel like I couldn’t have emotions. I couldn’t cry,  so i taught myself to not cry, not even when my sister went missing, I taught myself to not feel fear, at my brothers funeral is when I finally let out emotion. it was all my fault he was gone, I cried all day all night, breaking years I worked on. Everyone blamed and left me, my mother could barely talk to me. I was there when he died in the hospital, my brother was in a coma and watching him die, holding his hand was the worst thing I could’ve experienced. After that my sister was declared dead, they never found her so I spent so much time at their graves I basically lived there.The abuse was different after my brothers death, more rough, more aggressive, like he really wanted my life to be miserable. I starting taking pills, my nightmares grew worse and worse until I saw my brother, when I was awake. just in the corners of rooms, watching me. 2 years after his death my parents had a large fight. Before it was throwing glass, hitting, yelling and I’d protect my siblings and lock the door or sometimes even help my mum but this time was different. It was worse. My siblings weren’t here with me anymore, I could only go out for a walk to feel somewhat relaxed. From what I heard, my mum slapped my father, took her bags and keys and drove off. I was walking when I suddenly heard a car, I turned around and saw my mothers car was speeding towards the clift, with her eyes filled with tears, she drove off the Clift. I called the police immediately, but they could’t save her. She was deformed, looked nothing like what I remembered. Around three weeks after my mum died, my dad went “missing” but I saw him die. I knew the police wouldn’t believe me so I told Noah and wrote it in my red notebook, like I always do. 



  
So yeah, anyways I was walking home from Noah’s house in my new neighbourhood, new life with my headphones on when suddenly I hear it, the worst sound of my life. A car engine. My eyes shot wide as I looked up, I was crossing the crosswalk when a car started speeding towards me. I thought this was the end, until I felt a heavy shove. At first I was confused until I turned around and realised what had happened. Noah went on a walk, and just before I almost died he pushed my out of the road and took his own life for me. I trembled with fear as I slowly approached his body, dragging him off the road and in my arms. I begged him to hold on, asking him we he would do this but he just smiled. While I was calling 000, he sniffled and did this hand movement, one of our inside jokes since we were young. Tears ran down my face as I remembered all our memories, we had this anklet that we somehow never grew out off. always wore it, my body was filled with scars and heck we even had couple same scars from house fires and multiple other injuries.

  
skip forward, I’m in the hospital, I never left his side. I was either outside his room or sitting on a chair in his room. I never went home. His youngest sister went missing, the same time my mum died but I was with him longer than his parents or other sister was. I basically lived in his hospital. The next day, (I didnt go home) my neighbour Kayleigh decided she wanted to come to his hospital. Worse choice she could’ve made. She acted so emotional, though she never even had a conversation with Noah. Suddenly she sat down next to me and told me exactly “You know Mike? I understand you. My father died a while back I know how it feels. you can talk to me, I’m always here.” I swear I twitched at that. She wasn’t here for Noah, she wanted to use my best mates death to talk to me. I gripped my knuckles tighter as I raised my voice at her “The thing is, you don’t know how it is. you don’t know how I feel just because your dad died. You don’t know how it is to watch your whole family, and life crumble right infront of your eyes as everyone blames you for it. So stop trying to act like you understand because you don’t and you never will for gods sake.” She started full on crying. The doctors and nurses all looked at me but I couldnt care less what anyone thought of me anymore. I only cared about Noah.



>  
a couple days later she tries to talk to me but I ignored her fully, now everyone thinks I’m a jerk, am I in the wrong?

1poxv5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1poxv5s/mother_left_without_me/,Mother left without me,"I’m just feeling really sad and hurt this morning and just need a place to vent. 

Last night my mother mentioned that she had the day off tomorrow and asked if I’d like to go to this new coffeeshop in town with her and maybe do some Christmas errands. It’s not often my mother and I have a shared day off, so I agreed, thinking it would be fun! 

Shortly after she changes the topic and breaks the news to me that my sister and her fiancé are separating and that it seems likely that my niece will stay with her father. This was a shock to me and of course I felt sad and upset at the situation, mainly feeling for my niece. 

My mother has always had a habit of dropping bad news on me and then leaving me to process it on my own, or get upset with me for having emotions towards the news. For example, when my parents split up when I was a young child she said “Your dad isn’t going to live with us anymore.” And that was that. I wasn’t allowed to ask questions and she’d get frustrated with me when I would be upset/cry. 

I understand that maybe this is how she deals with bad news/situations herself, or her way of avoiding facing her own feelings about things, but her silent treatment has always hurt me since I was a child. She leaves me to deal with the bad news and doesn’t respond when I try to talk with her. 

So after she told me last night and made a comment on how I’m letting the news ruin our evening, I told her that I don’t appreciate her dumping things on me and then not allowing it to be talked about. It’s always been like that in my family, bad stuff is always brushed over and we have to go on pretending certain things never happened or that it doesn’t affect anything. 

She stayed silent for most of the evening after that but then before she went to bed told me we can talk in the morning. She didn’t say anything about our plans being canceled, but maybe I should have just assumed. 

When I woke this morning (at 6:30am, so it’s not like I slept in super later) I was met with an empty house and her car gone from the driveway. Then when I went on social media she had posted pictures of the new coffee shop. So she left without me and I haven’t heard from her at all. No texts or note or anything. I feel like I’m overreacting, but with all the stuff happening in life lately, I just felt very hurt that she chose to go do our plans without me and not even telling me. I love my mother, but these moments really trigger those childhood wounds. Makes me feel like I should just keep everything bottled up because my feelings ruin things.

I’d wake up tired, rely on coffee to function, crash mid-afternoon, and somehow still struggle to fall asleep at night. I wasn’t overeating, but I definitely wasn’t feeling balanced either. That’s what pushed me to look into cortisol and eventually try **The Best 7 Day Cortisol Detox Diet Meal Plan**.

I didn’t expect miracles. I mainly wanted to see if changing *what* and *when* I ate could calm things down a bit. I followed the plan loosely—no perfection, no extremes—and focused on consistency instead.

What stood out immediately is that **The Best 7 Day Cortisol Detox Diet Meal Plan** isn’t about restriction. It’s about stability. Regular meals, balanced plates, and foods that don’t spike stress hormones further. Just that shift alone made the week feel different from other “detox” attempts I’ve tried.

By around day three, I noticed:

* Fewer intense afternoon crashes
* Less jitteriness from caffeine
* Better sleep quality
* More predictable hunger signals

The biggest change wasn’t weight—it was how *steady* I felt. That’s when **The Best 7 Day Cortisol Detox Diet Meal Plan** started to make sense to me. Cortisol isn’t the enemy, but constant stress plus under-fueling definitely doesn’t help.

One thing I appreciated was the emphasis on not skipping meals. I used to delay eating to “be productive,” which only made cravings worse later. Eating consistently felt almost boring at first—but it worked. Protein at breakfast made a bigger difference than I expected.

I followed this breakdown of [**The Best 7 Day Cortisol Detox Diet Meal Plan**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/7-day-cortisol-detox-diet-meal-plan/) because it explains why certain foods support hormone balance instead of just listing them. That helped me stick with it without overthinking every meal.

What didn’t help was trying to rush results. This isn’t a quick fix. The **The Best 7 Day Cortisol Detox Diet Meal Plan** works best when you see it as a reset—not a solution to everything. Once I dropped expectations of instant changes, the improvements felt more realistic and sustainable.

By the end of the week, I kept a few habits:

* Eating earlier in the day
* Pairing carbs with protein
* Drinking less coffee, more water
* Prioritizing sleep alongside food

Those changes stuck longer than the plan itself.

I’m curious—has anyone else here tried adjusting their diet specifically to lower stress or support cortisol? Did it actually help, or did it feel like another wellness trend?

This was at the end of last year. And it was super stressful and difficult for me because we still had projects and work together, so that’s why I still had to see him from time to time.

There were also a few confusing things that happened after the break up. He gave me back my things after I asked for them, but included some gifts with my stuff when he brought it back. Which felt like mixed messages to me. He would also still be hot and cold, greeting me sometimes and acting like I didn’t exist at other times. Inviting me to group things after work and then uninviting me at the last minute. Sending me a message that he wanted to move on and keep contact to the bare minimum, and then deliberately making an effort to have a conversation with me in person when I was respecting his request for distance.

All of these things left me feeling really confused. I obviously didn’t want the breakup in the first place and I still loved him so it was hard to let go. I was dating and seeing someone new but every time I saw my ex, the hot and cold behaviour really affected me and it put a strain on my new relationship. I eventually ended it because I didn’t think it was fair to the other person.

Finally, I also decided to leave that workplace because it was just too stressful for me. I asked to say goodbye to him before I left (nothing dramatic, just coffee or even a brief chat). He said that’s fine we can do that, and then the week I was leaving and we were supposed to meet, I texted to plan the meet-up and he had blocked me. 

After leaving, I still struggled so much to let go and move on. 

I knew that I didn’t want to be with him. He wasn’t a good partner to me. He used to ghost me for days after a good date or a fun weekend. And he even said we couldn’t see each other on weekends anymore after a period of things going really well. He would constantly criticise me and point out my flaws, he never gave compliments. He liked to act like he didn’t care and didn’t need me. He walked ahead of me in public and didn’t hold my hand. He also did this really weird thing where he couldn’t say my name if I was there. And he never addressed me as anything. He once even wrote me a card and didn’t address it to me! It just started with the message, but he still signed it with his name at the end. This was of course, interspersed with love bombing and such, which is why I kept going back and forth over leaving. And he had also told mutual friends that he really liked me and wanted to get married one day. Which kept me in the relationship and waiting for things to improve.



But even though I knew I could find someone who treated me better, and that I would even be better off single, my attachment system was still really activated. I kept replaying conversations and interactions over and over again in my mind, trying to figure out where things went wrong. I would dream about him often and wake up feeling dysregualted and in tears sometimes. I would feel an urgent need to reach out to him just to have a final, positive interaction, or to check his social media and see what he was up to. Even though I resisted doing those things for the most part, the urge was there almost daily. 



After a few months of this, he unblocked me and sent me a message by mistake, so I sent him a message just to wish him well. He read it but he ignored it and didn’t reply. And I was so confused. I just didn’t understand why things couldn’t be okay between us. I had accepted the discard and his not wanting to speak after, I had let him go and moved on, I had respected his requests for space and minimal contact. I basically gave him everything he wanted. And he had unblocked me so I thought sending him a message or having a little contact would be okay. 

Anyway, months after my last message, he texted me on my birthday. Nothing special, just “happy birthday, enjoy it.” And it was like the final piece my nervous system and brain needed to close the loop. After that, I finally saw the relationship and him for what they truly were. No putting him on a pedestal anymore. No more ruminating, no dreams. The urge to check up on him was gone, the urge to have contact was gone too. I’ve been feeling happy and calm and like my old self since then. His message wasn’t anything special, but just that bit of neutral contact, not hostile, not love-bombing or bread-crumbing, was enough for my mind to let it go and close the loop.

I think a lot of avoidants misunderstand their ex’s feelings after being discarded with no explanation, or after being ghosted. They’re not reaching out because they still love you or are trying to convince you to take them back. It’s that they’re struggling to close the loop in their mind. Because the ending was so sudden and unexplained. Because it’s human nature to obsess over a thing that’s still “open”. Because they really loved you and they wanted to let go with love, not blocking or avoidance or ghosting. I know avoidants complain about people not leaving them alone when it’s clearly “done”. But for the other person, it may not be so clear. You know why you ended it but you never told them. It came out of the blue for them or they were just ghosted. It’s hard to understand that and manage it, when you don’t have avoidance to lean on to take the pain or thoughts away. 

Also, just to note, I know a lot about how avoidants feel because I used to be severely avoidant leaning. I don’t think was ever as severe as this recent ex, but I also used to unknowingly use avoidance as a way to cope with overwhelming feelings or situations. At the time, I thought I was being emotionally mature. I also ended things with a discard (although I didn’t realise it at the time) with a different ex in the past. I reached out to him after this whole thing to apologise because I finally experienced the pain he did, and I understood why he had needed to talk after things ended. And I think he honestly was waiting for that contact even after all this time. Not to get back together, but to close the loop. 

So there’s no judgement. Just something for people to consider. You don’t lose anything by being kind to someone after a breakup.

Obviously this doesn’t apply to exes who are being abusive, stalking you, disregarding your boundaries etc. And also to be clear, ghosting is not setting a boundary. It’s normal to want to talk after a breakup, even if you respect the other person’s choice to end the relationship. ",8,1765981559.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
1poxtc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Wallaby_9624/comments/1poxtc1/i_tried_the_1day_cleanse_how_to_rapidly_purify/,"I tried The 1-Day Cleanse: How to Rapidly Purify, Detox and Rejuvenate Your Body & Mind — here’s what felt real (and what didn’t)","I’ll be honest: I don’t have the patience for long cleanses. Life gets busy, meals get messy, and suddenly I’m feeling bloated, tired, and mentally foggy. I wasn’t looking to “fix everything,” just to feel like myself again. That’s why a one-day reset caught my attention—specifically **The 1-Day Cleanse: How to Rapidly Purify, Detox and Rejuvenate Your Body & Mind**.

I went into it cautiously. No starving, no weird supplements, no expectations of instant weight loss. I treated the day as a pause: lighter meals, more hydration, and fewer distractions. What surprised me most was how *calming* it felt. Removing decision fatigue around food for one day made a bigger difference than I expected.

Here’s what actually helped during the day:

* Starting with warm water instead of coffee
* Drinking consistently (not chugging all at once)
* Choosing light, simple foods instead of skipping meals
* Slowing down eating and paying attention to fullness

By the afternoon, I noticed less bloating and steadier energy. Not a “buzz,” just a smoother feeling. That’s where **The 1-Day Cleanse: How to Rapidly Purify, Detox and Rejuvenate Your Body & Mind** started to make sense to me—it’s not about forcing detox, it’s about *supporting* digestion and recovery.

I made one mistake early on: expecting fast, dramatic changes. Once I dropped that mindset, the day felt easier. The real benefits showed up later—better sleep that night and a lighter feeling the next morning. That alone made the reset feel worth it.

I followed this guide on [**The 1-Day Cleanse: How to Rapidly Purify, Detox and Rejuvenate Your Body & Mind**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/1-day-cleanse-rapid-detox-rejuvenation/) because it clearly outlines what to do (and what not to do), which helped me avoid extremes. It also frames the cleanse as optional and repeatable—not something you “fail” at.

Do I think a one-day cleanse magically purifies your body? No. But as a mental and digestive reset, **The 1-Day Cleanse: How to Rapidly Purify, Detox and Rejuvenate Your Body & Mind** felt practical—especially after travel, heavy meals, or stressful weeks.

Now I see it as a tool, not a rule. Something to use occasionally when things feel off, instead of jumping into restrictive plans.

Curious what others think—have you tried a one-day cleanse or reset before? Did it help with bloating, energy, or mental clarity, or did it feel pointless?

1poxs6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Wallaby_9624/comments/1poxs6w/i_started_focusing_on_cortisol_cleanse_foods_to/,I started focusing on Cortisol Cleanse Foods to Support Hormone Balance — here’s what actually helped my stress + energy,"For a long time, I thought my constant tired-but-wired feeling was just “normal life.” Waking up exhausted, craving sugar in the afternoon, feeling bloated, and struggling to sleep even when I was dead tired. I blamed stress, work, screens… everything except what I was eating.

Eventually, I kept seeing cortisol mentioned, especially in relation to stress and belly fat. That’s what led me to explore **Cortisol Cleanse Foods to Support Hormone Balance** — not as a cleanse, but as a way to stop making things worse.

I didn’t change my entire diet overnight. I just started adding and removing a few things and watched how my body reacted. The biggest shift was realizing that skipping meals and relying on caffeine was probably pushing my stress hormones higher, not lower. The idea behind **Cortisol Cleanse Foods to Support Hormone Balance** is less about restriction and more about *stability*.

Here’s what genuinely helped:

* Eating regular meals instead of “pushing through” hunger
* Adding protein and healthy fats to breakfast
* Reducing constant coffee intake (not eliminating, just spacing it out)
* Including calming, nutrient-dense foods instead of ultra-processed snacks

After about a week, I noticed my energy felt steadier. I wasn’t crashing as hard in the afternoon, and my sleep felt deeper. Nothing dramatic, but enough to feel encouraging. That’s when **Cortisol Cleanse Foods to Support Hormone Balance** started to make sense to me — it’s about creating an environment where your body can calm down.

One thing I appreciated is that this approach doesn’t treat cortisol like the enemy. It’s a necessary hormone — it just gets out of balance when we’re under constant stress and under-fueled. I followed this guide on [**Cortisol Cleanse Foods to Support Hormone Balance**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/cortisol-cleanse-foods-support-hormone-balance/) because it clearly explains which foods support hormone balance and *why*, instead of just listing “superfoods.”

What didn’t help was expecting fast results. This isn’t a quick fix. The **Cortisol Cleanse Foods to Support Hormone Balance** approach works best when you think in terms of days and weeks, not overnight changes. Once I stopped trying to rush it, the changes felt more sustainable.

Now I focus on a few basics:

* Don’t skip meals
* Balance carbs with protein
* Eat foods that feel grounding, not stimulating
* Support sleep as much as possible

That alone reduced a lot of my stress-related symptoms.

I’m curious — has anyone else here tried changing their diet specifically to support cortisol or stress hormones? Did you notice a difference, or did it feel like another wellness trend?

1poxs57,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1poxs57/i_cannot_remember_anything_about_my_grandmothers/,I cannot remember anything about my grandmothers funeral,"TW: Cancer, death of grandparent

Today is the 11 year anniversary of my grandmothers passing. They diagnosed her with pancreatic cancer and within a couple of months she passed away. I was absolutely devastated and still am. I loved her a lot and I still sometimes cry because I miss her and can't share my milestones, big or small,  with her. I remember her really well and the things we did together like, hikes, going to the pool, teaching me to knit (or at least trying to because i was young and impatient) and so on. I remember everything. But now on her anniversary I tried to remember her funeral and ... nothing. I don't remember a single thing. 

I know we went to church, I know we went to the graveyard and some place afterwards for a coffee or something like that. But just because that's what you do. I don't have memories about any of this. I was 12 at the time so, it's not because of my age and I remember the other funerals I went to (except the one of my grandfather because I was barely 6). 

It feels incredibly strange and unsettling, as if there is a gap in my memory. Does anybody else experience this and can I do anything to remember it again?",3,1765981410.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

Never talk to her again. forget she exists, or I will tell your wife. I have your phone number and connections with the police. I will find you ruin your life like you ruined mine. Fuck you!

Not sure what the dude is so upset about. I live in a small town, ladies don't post their ads here, only men do, hence it's not like I seduced his wife out of her quiet marital slumber, it was she who found me and reached out to me.

Moreover, I haven't had any real life affairs with anyone over the last couple of years, just a few coffee dates and online streaks. I also don't sext or exchange pics on Reddit, I switch to Telegram. But he contacted me on Reddit, which means all he could have seen in Reddit chats was just some mild flirting. Shouldn't be that bad. All that said, I'm sure it was him who ""ruined a good family"".

Black Rifle has not responded as of yet.  It is early. 

The last paragraph was a good summary. 

“Black Rifle’s annual revenue is around four hundred million, market cap about one hundred forty million, so anything huge would hurt, but most likely it’ll end in a modest settlement or get tossed early. No updates since November.”

I believe market cap is higher, closer to $300M given total shares in all share classes. 

I believe this case is weak, but it may have some political backing.   Nothing is surprising in CA.
