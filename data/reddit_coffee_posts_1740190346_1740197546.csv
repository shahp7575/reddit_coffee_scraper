1iva84o,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1iva84o/using_exhausted_parents_as_a_marketing_tool/,Using exhausted parents as a marketing tool,"I've recently seen 2 commercials (in the US), one from Amazon and one from Walmart, where they show a montage of a mom or dad running around changing diapers, getting up at night, trying to make coffee, and doing all that crazy stupid parenting shit. The commercials end with the exhausted parent collapsing, then having just enough energy to order diapers and baby supplies and coffee from their app, and having it delivered right to their front door. Thank God these poor tired parents don't also have to run to the store! 

I find it ironic that these mega-corporations are targeting the demographic which they have enslaved. These parents have to work 2 jobs and run themselves ragged to take care of babies they can't afford because the rich need to be richer. They drive up prices on everything and then turn around and market themselves as the hero of the day. 

These commercials advertise birth control to folks like me. It's a very realistic depiction of the hellscape of parenthood. Why would anyone want this?!",1,1740197471.0,childfree,0,1.0,False
1iva6w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1iva6w7/from_dreads_to_depositions_my_journey_from_phish/,From Dreads to Depositions: My Journey from Phish Tour to Corporate Law,"When I first stepped into law school, I knew I had an advantage over my classmates. While they were coming straight from their econ majors and poli-sci honors programs, I had something more valuable: real-world experience.

I wasn’t like these kids who had spent their whole lives in textbooks. No, I had lived the law. I had felt the cold injustice of the system firsthand when I was arrested at a Phish concert for smoking a joint in 2011. The charges were eventually dropped when my home state legalized cannabis (a decision I like to think I played some small part in influencing), but that experience stayed with me. I knew then that I had a calling to fight the system from the inside.

But first, I had to finish my degree.

I had taken a few…let’s call them intentional breaks from undergrad. College wasn’t really my focus back then. I was broadening my mind, exploring alternative modes of living, and following Phish on tour through the Southwest. Eventually, I returned to finish my degree in what I describe as a multi-disciplinary approach to law, ethics, and society (some call it ‘Liberal Studies,’ but I find that term limiting).

Law school, of course, was a rude awakening. The professors were mostly frauds, mere academics who had never even seen the inside of a courtroom. One dared to tell me I was misunderstanding a case. I, a man who had personally been through the criminal justice system! Of course, I corrected her.

The students were even worse. One kid told me he was ‘interested in securities law.’ Securities law. I told him that was just capitalism’s way of keeping people docile and he should focus on the real legal battles. He nodded, then walked away and never spoke to me again.

Despite the systemic roadblocks put in place (a rigid attendance policy, an insistence on ‘citing sources’), I thrived. I graduated near the top of my class, thanks to my ability to think outside the casebook and a near-mastery of cold-calling tactics that left my professors speechless (some called it ‘interrupting,’ I call it passionate debate).

I had originally planned to go into criminal defense, give back to the people who really needed legal protection. But then I saw an offer from Kensington & Parr LLP, a firm specializing in corporate litigation, and I thought, who better to dismantle the system than someone working within it? So, yes, I now work in regulatory compliance for a pharmaceutical company, a temporary detour in my larger plan. (The six-figure salary and company Amex are merely tools to finance my eventual rebellion.)

I still keep a Phish bumper sticker on my car. Not out of nostalgia, but as a reminder of where I came from. Sometimes, when I sit in my corner office reviewing contracts that help multinational corporations circumvent environmental regulations, I take a deep breath and think, I’ve really made a difference.

And if any of my young colleagues ever want to learn a thing or two about real lawyering, I’m always available for a mentor coffee. Just don’t ask me what my undergraduate degree was in.",1,1740197357.0,LawSchool,0,1.0,False

I can't believe I'm telling anyone this but...

I (16F) have an addiction to watching Korean Cafe vlogs. THERE I SAID IT.

With the phone ban and limited video access on YouTube, I have resorted to watching cafe employees make coffee, tea, and other various drinks. 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, there is a Korean woman making beverages on my school laptop screen. IT'S BEEN 4 MONTHS. I'm addicted. My friends... my teachers... even my family, they're all concerned... they give me weird looks when I'm enamored with my screen, watching beverages being made, and a bag of goldfish in hand (unrelated). ""Is everything alright at home"" Yes Mr. Teacher, yes everything's all right at home. My problem is Korean Cafe Vlogs. ""It's consuming you!"" I KNOW THAT MY AMIGO... I know... 😔

Looking for a little help. I use something similar to this: https://a.co/d/1XB3foQ

I follow the instructions and do the following:

1. Grind the beans coarsely (I have a TimeMore C2 that I set to 24 “clicks”).
2. Fill the strainer with grounds so thats theres about an inch left
3. Fill with water overtop of the grounds (NOTE: for some reason I have to do this very slowly. Otherwise, the water overflows instead)
4. Shake
5. Refridgerate for 24 hour, shaking occasionally

No matter what I do, the coffee turns out weak. Things I’ve tried:

1. Using the strainer “in reverse” (grounds in jar, then strainer, then water)
2. Using finer-ground coffee (a few users here mentioned their coffee tasting STRONGER after doing so)
3. Turning the jar upside down.

Any help or tips with this particular method? Specifically, it seems like most vids just show people pouring water into the jar and filling it up quickly, whereas I seem to need to slowly drip water into the jar.

1iva1za,https://i.redd.it/yh2ockvs6mke1.jpeg,You have a choice...,"Time becomes liquid inside those walls. Each day stretches like taffy, yet somehow eight years slip through your fingers. The fluorescent lights never fully illuminate the shadows in your mind. Your cell - 8 by 10 feet - becomes both sanctuary and cage. The concrete walls absorb your whispered frustrations but never whisper back. The deepest cut is the absence of touch. Not just intimate touch, but the simple human contact we take for granted - a handshake, a hug, a pat on the back. You catch yourself staring at old photos, tracing the outline of faces with your fingertip. The scent of perfume becomes a distant memory, replaced by the sharp smell of industrial cleaners and steel. Depression seeps in like the cold from the walls. It makes a home in your bones. Some days, you pace like a caged animal. Other days, you lay motionless, watching shadows crawl across the ceiling. The world outside keeps turning - children grow, parents age, relationships wither. Letters become fewer, visits shorter. The gap between you and the outside world widens until even familiar faces start to feel like strangers. Simple pleasures become amplified in their absence. The taste of a home-cooked meal. The feeling of grass under bare feet. A soft pillow. A warm embrace. You dream of ordinary moments - walking to a coffee shop, driving with the windows down, sitting in a park watching people pass by. The mind wanders to memories of affection, of gentle touches and tender moments, until the harsh reality of steel and concrete snaps you back. At night, after count, when the cellblock grows quiet except for distant echoes and the occasional cough or muffled cry, that's when loneliness takes its heaviest toll. You lie there, staring into darkness, wondering how many other men are doing the same thing, each alone with thoughts of what was lost and what might never be found again. A good meal becomes mythical in your mind. Not just the taste, but the entire ritual - the clink of real silverware, the weight of a proper plate, the luxury of taking your time.
 You catch yourself fantasizing about simple dishes - a burger grilled just right, a fresh salad, even an ice-cold soda in a real glass. Eight years teaches you things about yourself you never wanted to know. It shows you both your strength and your breaking points. It reveals how much of what we call personality is actually just habit and circumstance. Most of all, it teaches you that freedom isn't just about walking through an open door - it's about all the small choices we make every day that we never realize are choices at all. Time behind bars carved deep lessons into my soul - it was the most challenging experience I've ever faced, testing every fiber of my being. In those concrete walls and steel bars, I discovered that confinement presents a profound choice: you can either let the system harden you into a more seasoned convict, or you can use that time as a crucible for personal transformation. I chose the harder path of growth, using those difficult days to reflect, learn, and rebuild myself from the inside out. The isolation and hardship taught me patience, resilience, and the true value of freedom. Most importantly, it showed me that even in the darkest places, we have the power to choose who we become. Today, I carry those lessons with me - not as a burden, but as the foundation of the man I've grown to be and continue striving to become. I chose to be a better man, and that decision has made all the difference.❤️✌️💯💪🙏💯💕✌️",3,1740196890.0,ExCons,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iv9zm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1iv9zm7/1_year_plus/,1 Year Plus,"I made it to the 1 year mark a few weeks ago. I didn’t post because it seemed odd to me in the moment. There’s no big party even though it might be one of the biggest accomplishments of your life. Either way I thought I’d share some things I’ve learned this year in case it helps someone else. 

-It does get easier. Some days are still hard as shit but those days tend to come at a lower frequency. 
-Don’t beat yourself up if you need to do something else habitually to help avoid the drink. 
-Ice cream is fucking amazing. 
-So is coffee. 
-You can do all the other stuff without drinking (vacations, airports, bars, group dinners, etc) but if it is going to trigger you skip it. 
-I like the taste of Diet Coke without bourbon
-No one else really cares that much if you’re not drinking. You think about it way more than they do. 
-Society puts way too much emphasis on drinking; companies want to make you think you can’t have a good time without it. That’s not true. 
-I do still miss it at times and that will probably never go away. 
-When I feel like caving I think about things I’ve done in the past because of alcohol and remind myself that it could happen again and possibly with worse outcomes. It’s not worth it. 
-I don’t know if I can do it forever but I’m trying. 
-Worry about today, today; and tomorrow, tomorrow.

In 2019 I was in a 6-month storybook relationship that reached the point of meeting eachothers parents, going on vacation together, saying I love you, then her going back to her abusive ex-husband and leaving me an emotional wreck, an injury I was not allowed to heal from, because then Covid happened)

Over this summer, I encountered someone I immediately found arresting.  She had grey/green stare-right-through-you eyes and a dreamy voice with a little hiss in it (a sideways eyetooth), tall, long jaw, and Tina Fey hips.  We were both regulars at a geek-themed pub that we'd both also worked for a bit, and we both played RPGs there, just on different nights.  I'm pretty used to being struck by people, quickly figuring out they don't feel the same, and moving on.  But she kept...talking to me.

I think our first verbal interaction was me making a joke that fell flat, so on the way out I said ""Sorry about before, the point of the joke was that I was dumb for thinking you didn't know what drinks come with limes, not that you didn't know."" (he said, anxiously over-explaining).  She replies that it's okay, she's bad at picking up jokes sometimes, being autistic.

Now, I've been increasingly hearing people claiming to be autistic as part of their collection of labels (queer/NB/demi-semi-hemi-asexual/et cetera), and it often makes me roll my eyes internally, because we can spot our own and they isn't that.  But this woman definitely was; the stare was a big clue (I've had encounters before that I can best sum up as *""Oooooooh, so what I thought was eye-fucking was just you being slightly autistic.  Doy""*), but subsequent interactions made it airtight; we could actually talk to eachother.  I haven't really had spergversations like that in a while, definitely not with someone I found attractive; I can actually go back-and-forth with this person as we find thing after thing in common; she can explain to me what the fuck Father was in Fullmetal Alchemist; I'm a 1st-Series person, she'd read the manga and written fanfiction.  D&D comes up; she used to just make characters for fun back in high school, imagining what it'd be like to actually have people to play with.  Exactly what I used to do.  We got to talking about Tieflings; I hold forth that I liked the pre-4e lore where they weren't a race with their own history and culture and were more like mutants; then they can do the whole Half-Monster Guy Who Fights Monsters schtick, like Blade or Hellboy.  Turns out Hellboy is her comfort movie; something she watches when she's feeling down.  (Gee, I wonder why.  Another pang of Knowing That Feel, Bro)  She's got other interests, electric cello and cannibalism; I can hardly judge.

Another night, another encounter.  Quotes from her that still echo in my mind: ""I was wondering if I'd see you again tonight.""  ""You're really easy to talk to.""  I listen to a song of hers that no one else has heard yet, not even her best friend (her words).  She's doing a set at an open mic coming up, she gives me her phone number so she can update me when she knows the time/date.  She admits she works in sales because it let her practice socializing, which she used to be way worse at; pretending to be normal is tiring.  I too know that feel, that's exactly why I used to do Sales and now do Hospitality.

Her set falls through and she doesn't reply to a follow-up text from me trying to get a convo going, so I start to freak out a little bit.  I notice her reliably liking my Instagram posts, mostly photos of bugs, plants and wildlife I encounter on walks.

I'm unfortunately cursed with a romantic soul; methodical plans are how I express affection.  I see that her birthday is coming up, and she makes a post about attending at a watch-party that evening.  I brew up a laser-guided gift; I fire up the 3d Printer and make three life-sized Tooth Faeries out of green/blue filament and paint in the eyes and teeth.  (doesn't actually take me much effort, I used to play Warhammer).  To this, I add a trade paperback of Hellboy issue 1 that I accidentally bought a second copy of a year ago; she hasn't read the comics, but this is the one that the film is most drawn from.  On the inside cover, I write a dedication, with: ""All us freaks have is each other.""

I don't run into her until after the watch party, I had been playing it cool and not hunting for her.  But she takes my cardboard box of faeries as she hands me a basket of cupcakes she's passing around for her birthday; then I get a full-body hug.  She's absolutely charmed by the prints; she notices they all have different faces, she wants to give them names later, I get another spontaneous hug when she sees the writing.

Meanwhile, the bar we're at is having an open mic comedy night, and it's...bad.  Really, really bad.  But one or two of the comics say something tepidly edgy and she and her friends get affronted (I think there's a ""Gays for Palestine"" crack, and they get huffy that someone not obviously queer was talking about queerness).  I find this...worrying.  Also, I'm actually funny and have killed open mics a few times, but unfortunately it'd be hours before I could get on and school these fools.  My crush invites me to the next bar her crowd is going to, and I join them.

At the second bar, my crush is spending most of her attention on me.  She smokes American Spirit; I don't often smoke, but when I do, I also smoke American Spirit, so we chat outside.  It's...nice.

Me ""Do you ever feel like you live in a cyberpunk dystopia?""

Her ""All the time, playing pretend is how I get through the day.  Whenever I smoke, I imagine I'm in a noir story.""

""Right, but in this context, which of us is the hard-boiled detective and which is the dangerous dame?"" I say as I go for a lighter.  There's that sideways smile from her again.  There's that hazy gaze.

""Oop"" she stops me, and raises her own lighter to my face ""Pretty people don't light their own cigarettes.""

So of course I kiss her.  She leans in and there's mutual holding, some hair-play, I try to turn the kiss into a makeout-sesh, but she pulls back and I understand.  The night continues, I try not to monopolize her birthday time, but she keeps coming over to talk to me or ask me outside for another cig (and another kiss.)  

I learn more about her, some of it not feeding into my ""we're so alike"" narrative; she's an OG Occupy activist and activism in general seems to be a big thing for her.  I myself am an Ex-New-Atheist who's deeply butthurt that geek culture tore itself apart over politics and gender/culture stuff, which I'd hope you already figured out by now.  I remember the before-time, when us freaks actually did have each other.  I'm a little worried about her crowd; a bunch of the other people out with her have made ""men, amirite""-tier comments.  There's mention of autism being a superpower, which immediately makes me think of Jennifer Lawrence brushing her teeth in First Class; *mutant and proud, my ass.*  We're not all lucky enough to be played by Halle Berry.

>!My anxiety comes from a history of encounters with people who talk like this where inevitably I run afoul of one of their triggers and get a huffy Talking-To.  This followed by me saying I feel unfairly-treated, followed by them saying that as a straight white male, my feelings don't matter because I have it so good (or words to that effect, anyways).  I consider bringing up that I'm actually neurodivergent and it's been a source of difficulty and intense emotional pain for my entire life, but that'd be cringe, and wouldn't work anyways, so instead I silently express disgust and leave.!<

The night is winding down; it turns out, my crush has Narcolepsy and doesn't drive.  I offer her a ride to save her from paying for Uber; she holds my hand on the walk back to my car.  She's talking about how tired she is and how people have been buying her drinks all day, and I take this as telegraphing that I'm not gonna be invited in for hot coffee or to see any etchings.  I drop her off with a final kiss, and head home feeling unfamiliar feels that I think might have been happiness.

The next day, I get a Text:

""Just so you know, I'm really unhappy that you made out with me while I was drunk.  I'm really upset and that's not how I wanted my birthday to go.""

My head is fucked.  What exactly what level of flirting am I allowed to reciprocate with physical affection?  A woman could have her hand down my pants and I'd be forced to assume she was just being friendly.  I apologize and ask her how I should comport myself going forwards.  No reply.

*And I fucking lost the second half of this to a mis-click, so now you get the abridged version.*

We do run into eachother again, me having an internal panic attack and her acting as if the entire evening hadn't happened.  We get to talking over text later

""Wait, you don't have that 'resents normies but yearns to be accepted by them' thing?  I thought all people like us carried that around.""

**""No, I really don't interact with neurotypical people much, and most of my friends are queer.""**

*So, you live in a hugbox.  That must be nice.  Some of us have to try to make our way in normieland.*

**I'm just kinda tired of straight guys assuming I'm not asexual""**

*\[eye twitches in repressed rage\] There it is, reset the clock.*

**Anyways, I already have a crush and that works for me.**

*So...when you occasionally want intimacy, you've got a guy for that.  And between then, you call straight guys pretty then get confused and annoyed that they think that means something.*

# In Conclusion

Words echo through my mind

*You're really easy to talk to*

*I wondered if I was going to see you here*

*Pretty people don't light their own cigarettes*

*Lisa needs braces*

*DENTAL PLAN!*

I know I'm plenty to blame for this.  It turns out, just because I have diabetes, and she also has diabetes, that doesn't mean we have to be boyfriend and girlfriend, that's not a real rule.  But...fuck me, I thought someone liked me.  I just wanted to go on a date with her and listen to her gabble about Anime and Cannibalism and the Cello.  ...and go to town on her ladyparts, ideally, eventually.

I am introverted but I try to talk to people to get out of my comfort shell, but it is exhausting.  I am shy, I do want to try and talk to people but I just cant find the words to make an engaging conversation. I dont have any hobbies as I am not interested in anything and I have tried lots of different activities. I dont really enjoy architecture, Im not passionate for the course itself, but it is the most appealing course amongst the rest. I also am struggling to keep up as Im in my final year of uni. I have thought of changing courses so many times but it always comes back to architecture being the most suitable course for me.

Here is the main problem, I am not motivated to live or have a life, almost every week I think about what to do in the future, I dont wanna work just to continue to suffer, that leads to thoughts about suicide, disappearing and starting a new life, a reason starting a new life is an option because I feel like Im pressured to graduate and work and all that but in reality, no one is pressuring me but myself. Honestly, if there was an option, that would not cause any pain/sadness towards my loved ones, I would kill myself instantly, that is what is holding back rn, as it is not fair for my to end my life and cause such pain towards them.

Hi again, so I did a few things different this time 

First off I went later in the morning (I may have to start doing this for my long runs ongoing) so I definitely got more sleep 😴 

Pre run: 2 hrs before start time 
Electrolyte water 
Coffee 
Grapefruit 
Oatmeal 
1 banana (half mashed in oats) 
Almond butter 
Raisins

Right before start : gu gel 

During run: 
Dates, I think I ended up eating 3 
Water 
Scratch hydration 

Post run:
Red Bull 
Teriyaki chicken with broccoli and rice 

I know it’s good to carb load pre run but what about post run, or should I focus on protein more ? 

Overall I am happy with my splits today and I feel that I did better on this run for the most part although I can’t really pin point what made the difference as I did quite a few things differently this time. I didn’t necessarily feel hungry or want to eat during the run but as per suggestions made myself as prep for longer runs 

I will try applesauce pouch next run

I had two cups of coffee today. I used to always have two cups of coffee and sometimes three. Currently my usual is one cup of coffee a day. Whatever can keep my metabolism boosted is fine by me.  
  
And my metabolism is boosted. I have been getting more hungry and sleepy than usual. That never happens. It’s also good for my liver. If I get obese again, my liver will get inflamed, so I make sure I’m not obese. It’s not very good for my heart or for anxiety. That’s what I’ve been told at least. I heard caffeine is good for focus, which I need more of.  
  
I’m not sure if I’m not focused enough or if I have too much stress and anxiety. It might be a mixture of both. Regardless I would rather be focused on my writing so I can get it done. I wish I didn't care about anything but my writing. Sadly I have emotions outside of writing so if I ever need coffee to write, I surely will.  
  
Sincerely,

While grinding coffee today, I noticed an ear piercing sound and found a very small plastic shard in between the outer burr and the main body of the coffee grinder. 

It was then that I realized the inner parts of the coffee grinder all had cracks (hopefully you can see in the image).

I noticed today too that the grind adjustment knob wasn’t working properly - could the cracked parts have anything to do with it? 

Most importantly, can I still use this? 😬

His world was structured, predictable. That was until he met Siya.

She was the architect on his latest project, a woman who saw the world in curves and colors, while he saw it in straight lines and efficiency. Their first meeting had been an argument—she wanted the windows to have a wooden finish to match the rustic theme, while he insisted that white UPVC was more practical and durable.

“You think functionality is everything,” she had scoffed.
“And you think aesthetics can ignore physics,” he had shot back.

Yet, over the weeks, something changed. Siya would bring him coffee when he worked late, and Aarav would double-check every measurement, ensuring perfection—not just for the project, but for her. The tension between them melted into something else, something neither had planned for.

One evening, as they stood on the half-finished balcony, Siya looked at the sunset through the newly installed window. “You know,” she murmured, “maybe windows aren’t just for protection. Maybe they’re also for letting the world in.”

Aarav looked at her, and for the first time, he realized—his life had always been about sealing things off. But Siya? She was the one opening him up.

And just like that, love found its way through the tiniest gap—just like a breeze through a half-open window.",0,1740195683.0,AskIndia,0,0.43,False

Looking to get back on the apps. And yes I’m looking for a serious relationship. F early 30s

I did not have good experiences on Coffee Meets Bagel (the algorithm sucked for me) or Hinge (really really don’t want to get into it on here just know it was bad) so please do not recommend those.

I did good on bumble in terms of a couple dates, and really want to try match. Idk about going on okcupid again, and unsure about eharmony and tinder. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated, especially since I’ve been seeing ads for boo, tawkify, woo plus and blush.

We talked about our interests, our goals after college, what we sought out of a relationship — and everything aligned! He was a near perfect match, and cute to boot. We planned to meet today for 1 PM at a coffee shop to get to know each other better. He insisted on picking me up, so I’d send him the details of my address closer to the meet-up time. Come morning, as I’m waiting to hear back from him, he’s unmatched with me. Awesome! 

Just feeling a little disheartened, because a similar incident occurred with another guy (M21) maybe a week or so before that. We got along well, but on the day of our date, he cancelled to pursue another girl. I appreciate that this guy reached out to me, at least, but the hurt remains. Actually, he left me a text and voice mail yesterday morning expressing how much he regrets going out with this other girl instead of me. His reasoning: they were at two different maturity levels. He wishes to take me out but I’m on the fence about it, since at the time, we both agreed to plan to talk to one another exclusively. It sort of feels like I’m the second option. 

It’s so hard to date these days. Part of me feels like no one is authentic or genuine with their intentions. I consider myself to be a pretty girl, with a fun personality, and I know I’m worthy of better. Just sucks that no one else sees that, I guess. Can anyone else with similar experiences relate?

1iv99mu,https://i.redd.it/vm72p4syylke1.png,Shirdi Sai in my life,"Shirdi Sai in my life

*

I will start with a small story.

Sri Ramana had a great devotee by the name Arthur Osborne. And Ramana instructed Arthur to write on Shirdi Sai's life and miracles in a dream!!
Arthur conveyed his inability to do so (in the dream itself), to which Ramana told Osborne to go to Sai's samadhi in Shirdi, and His tomb would help Osborne to write a biography.

Since I read this story, it got me interested in Shirdi Sai.

And I started reading about Baba in depth. And thereby came to know that Baba a wonderful person and did miracles at will. I was personally going through some issues, and I thought of praying to this great saint. And while browsing on the internet, I saw details about the Mahaparayan and read about the miracles of doing it in random Facebook groups. I went to the homepage and sent my WhatsApp number in the allotted menu. And by evening I was added to the Mahaparayan classroom.

I still think over it and feel like I was in an automatic mode while plugging in the number and filling in the details. I was doing all these, like a robot. I wasn't thinking!!! I just did. I don't know why, and I wasn't asking questions to myself.

The name of the classroom now is MP 4203 Suganya Sai. This wasn’t the name when I joined.

Saints always work in unison, I believe.

*

I started reading Shirdi Sai Sat Charitra the first time out of sheer curiosity.

I have heard about Shirdi Sai Baba. And I have always thought to myself that Baba is a great saint, and deep down in my heart I had some love and a great amount of reverence. But I never knew Baba in depth.

I planned a Saptaha Parayan starting from 30th March 2023. 7 chapters daily for 7 days and thus finish the holy book in one week. The book has 49 chapters. Some editions have 51. We have to plan the saptaha so that we finish the book in 7 days.

But on the 6th day of my saptaha (4 April 2023) after having read the 42nd chapter, a friend of mine forwarded me an image in WhatsApp. He didn't know the name of the saint and wanted to ask me. We used to discuss spiritual matters between us. Both of us were small-time devotees/fans of Sri Ramana Maharshi.

*

It was none other than Sri Shirdi Sai Baba's photo.

I had finished the day's Parayan just 2 minutes back. I was wonderstruck. Flabbergasted.

And I had read in one chapter while doing the Saptah Parayan that getting a picture in hand or being presented the same by someone is equivalent to having Baba's darshan.

I got the picture digitally through WhatsApp.

Please note that this was a wonderful coincidence. There's no way my friend knew about Shirdi Sai, let alone sent me a picture of Baba. He saw the picture as the display picture of some acquaintance he had on WhatsApp and decided to ask me, since both of us discussed saints and spiritual matters.

This experience blew my mind.

My friends are mostly from the Christian faith. I have some friends who are Hindus. And almost all of them are atheists. There are very few devoted Hindu friends for me. So any of my close friends getting to know Sai is very distant.

Most of them might not even have heard the name of Sai. 

The scenario that someone in my contact list knows about Sai and also knowing that I am reading the Charita is next to impossible.

I never told anyone that I was doing the Saptaha parayan. I didn't even tell my family. I was doing all this in secrecy, lest they accuse me of blasphemy (it's a Christian household).

I still feel that getting the picture of Sai digitally through WhatsApp is a miraculous thing for me.

*

I finished the Parayan on the 7th day (5th April 2023) in the morning.

*

I woke up in the morning and felt a change in the atmosphere in my room. Something “cloud” like is present in my room. Please note that I have never used any psychedelic stuff, nor am I under any psychiatric medication. I have never used drugs, nor have I smoked cigarettes. Am an occasional drinker though, but I didn’t have anything for the past months and definitely nothing during the past 7 days.

I woke up to this feeling and wondered to myself what this actually is.

I imagined that I was having some mental cloud and imagining stuff. I thought that once I finished my ablutions and had my coffee, the feeling would go away.

It didn't. It persisted even after I freshened up.

Gradually, it dawned on me. It's the presence of Baba. 

I feel Baba at each point in the house. I sat at a desk, and I felt Baba encircling me in a 360-degree sphere. Baba is literally everywhere. At each point in the house and brimming at each point.

I look to my right and left, and Baba is at each point. And encompassing inert stuff like the furniture and electronic equipment.

*

And thinking about this experience days later, I found some of Baba's dictums, sayings, and charters to be very true. And extremely grateful to Baba for having shown that to me.

 ""I am formless and everywhere.""

 ""I don't shake, and I don't move.""

 ""Those who think that Baba is only in Shirdi have totally failed to know me.""

 ""I am in everything and beyond. I fill all space.""

 ""All that you see taken together is Myself.""

 ""My people do not come to me of their own accord; it is I who seek and bring them to me.""  (This is very true. Baba literally pulled me to himself. And I can't go away from Baba, now).


All the above dictums of Baba are TRUE!!

*

I was moving in the house to get some work done, and I felt Baba everywhere, in other rooms too.

I went gardening in the small garden I have in the evening, and I felt Baba outside my house. In the plants, in the environment outside. Baba is alive, and everywhere.

I am moving in a sea of Baba's presence. Imagine the scenario of getting oneself under water with very little water pressure. That would explain my experience, to the closest I feel. Even though it really falls short of explanations.

It was like the proverbial ether.

A sea of Baba’s presence. I thought I was hallucinating for the whole time. But I don't think so. The feeling was heavenly, awesome, and I was very happy and blissful (not in the exact sense of the word, but very happy) until it lasted.

The entire space in my home, I felt Baba's sublime presence. It's beyond words and explanations. And I find it hard to put the same in words. And I know that even long-time devotees would feel skeptical. It has to be experienced to believe.

Aum Sai Ram.

May Baba bless us all.

She was single but out of my league. Not the classic popular girl but she was getting a lot of attention from other guys. Good grades and kinda nerdy, which I loved the most. She was nice to me since the first moment, which I wasn't used to. And to my surprise with the time she was talking to me more and more. Not that I didn't talk it's just she initiated a lot at the beginning when I didn't have the courage to do it. We have some common interests and I assumed she wanted to be my friend. I know a lot of guys would hate that but I was more than happy. And then she starts making plans for us to meet in other places, like movies, have a coffee and stuff. And she ends up saying that I'm so shy that she had to ask me on dates (I was on the verge of a heart attack). That was maybe for weeks ago. So we've been dating and she must've told this to someone else because I didn't. And then things get messy.

A guy asks me if I'm dating her, to which I basically don't respond. And he says I should be aware she's FWB with a guy I know. Not a friend but someone I see every day. And it's basically the kind of guy I'd expect she to be attracted to. Not a jock but athletic and good looking. My build doesn’t really stack up against his... But I'm not sure I trust this gossip so after a lot of stress I ask her. Not directly at first but I had to make the right questions in the end. And she admits their relationship. Then she admits they've been together two days before (for the last time) and then she starts telling me a lot of stuff about not being exclusive, and that dating me is different, that she's catching a lot of feelings, and she looked very concerned. I felt like I was struck by a train. I left and don't remember if I said something else. She sent me several messages saying that we can sort this out. I honestly don't think so. I have a mix of anger she's having a physical relationship while we're dating and I think that there is no point in me being intimate with her after she's been with that guy who knows for how long. She’d be pretty disappointed.

I'm not sure if I'm asking for help or just venting because I have no friends that can help with this. And I don't think there is hope for me in this situation anyways....",2,1740193911.0,dating_advice,2,0.75,False

Even kissed each other. We both confessed our feelings for one another and I desparately wanted to be in relationship with him.

Then in Feb 2022 I was chatting with him and he told his secret to me. He was dating another much younger girl for 2 months or so and they also liplocked and then she just dumped him and disappeared,blocking him from everywhere.This shameless man did not even think of how he broke my trust by doing all this.He instead gave the excuse that I am from a community different from his and there was no possibility of marriage. I agree him and I were not in committed relationship but I was just pissed off because I felt used and discarded. I don't know if that girl knew about my existence. I was badly burnt.Even though he realised later what he did and apologised me and I forgave him and decided to remain friends with him.

Yeah, sure. After trying Wix, Squarespace, and spending countless hours tweaking templates, I wasn’t buying it.

And while watching my wife do her skincare routine, I figured it would be wise to waste another five minutes of my life trying something like that out.

The interface was weirdly minimal. Just a **prompt input box** with a blinking cursor and a couple of buttons. **No templates, no drag-and-drop, no distractions.**

Wait, what? **How was I supposed to describe my website in one line?**

*""Make me a coffee website""* felt stupid.  
*""Professional coffee store landing page""* felt too robotic.

I glanced at my cold cup of morning coffee still sitting on my desk. Screw it.

I typed: **""Coffee""**

And hit **Generate.**

Twenty-three seconds later (I counted), it started spitting out **a full coffee brand website**—not just a page, an actual store-like experience.

A **hero section** with a premium **coffee bottle, a steaming cup, and golden lighting that screams “artisanal.”** A **Featured Collections** section showcasing different blends. An **Our Story** section, written like an actual brand narrative.

It even had a **step-by-step brewing guide**, customer testimonials, and **coffee tips & articles** for engagement.

Did I tweak some colors and swap a few photos? Yeah. But it took **15 minutes, not 3 days** of obsessing over fonts and button shadows.

Look, it’s not perfect. But it was **good enough to launch with, and that’s what I needed.** Sometimes, *done is better than perfect*, especially when you’re running on caffeine and impostor syndrome.

BTW, the **""Our Coffee Story"" section** somehow sounded exactly like how I'd describe my love for coffee. *How did it know?*

Maybe I’m just easily impressed because it’s **2 AM and I’ve had too much coffee.**

Sheriff Thompson stepped out of his patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of the officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size of it and the type of wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called, a man named Jacob Webb.""

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and something sulfuric lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbor that found it?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer neither. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair so run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Any other kids?""

""She had a husband but he died shortly after their only boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin' back then and I s'pose the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin', the next day he's...not. He was up walkin' around again like he weren't ever sick.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr. Webb nodded, walking slowly back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

<><><><><><>

The Sheriff walked into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank ya, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down, blowing out a short quick breath. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that damn house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""Well, the ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the bigger bone fragments in the ashes.""

The sheriff looks down at his hands, rubbing them together as if he could still feel the ash on his fingertips.

""They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not scorched part of the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that.""

The sheriff stood quickly, pushing his chair back in frustration. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah! We've been going over this case for weeks, we've been talking to every medical examiner, firefighter, police force and goddamned self proclaimed arsonist around and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense!""

Josiah sat back, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. After some some long talks and a few too many whiskey sours, I might have something. But sheriff, you have to trust me.""

""You know I trust you, Josiah, I need SOMETHING in this case.""

Josiah sat forward, looking for that trust in the sheriff's eyes as he pulled a stack of disheveled research papers from his desk drawer. 

""Let me ask you something. Have you ever heard of spontaneous human combustion?""

<><><><><>

Mary Keller sat back in her armchair, a lit cigarette perched between her shaky fingers. 

She stared at the unassuming man sat across from her, her eyes threatening to spill the tears she'd held back all night. 

""So,"" Mary said, taking a long drag ""this is it then?""

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please..."" she sucked in a sharp breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could invoke some compassion within him. 

""Please let me have a few more years. I'm not ready to go.""

""Mary, you signed a contr-""

""I know I signed the goddamned contract! I was desperate! I didn't know what else to do!""

She placed her head in her hands and wept, the man patiently waiting for her speak again. She wiped her nose with the back of her hand and placed her cigarette, still smoldering, into the ash tray. The man stood and offered a hand to her. 

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

""It's hell, Mary. What do you think it's like?""",1,1740193512.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1iv8y15,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1iv8y15/im_worried_im_his_filling_hole_first_time/,Im worried I'm His filling hole (first time relationship),"Hey guys. I (27m) met a younger guy (m22) on New Years Eve party. We kissed on the dance floor and after a week We met for coffee and I've booked a hotel room, which He stayed only for a few hours just to kiss and cuddle. It was also my first time with another man.

The next thing i know He invites me few weeks later to His apartment, We kiss so hard and cuddle i'm worrying this is to good to be true.

Welp, after getting it together for the second time, He questions me if this is a FWB situation or what? Which i reply: ""We'll see how it goes"" - and I feel i screw up.

The next week, We actually sexted, sending each other photos, dreaming of each other, writing whats up. But the problem for me is when I am with Him. He seems so empty and I am afraid to talk about it more, because He just replies it's OK.

He's flirting with me, saying how good I look, or how He loves my body, which im scared to reply but he knows im loving it.

He told me he broke up with his ex 4 and a half month ago. He showed me together photos. His ex was a gay older bear too. I must say he calls me a bear very often (which i like it) and He actually asked me If he can call me daddy (dayum im 27 😩). 

From now on it's kinda hard for me. We really didn't say we're in a boyfriend relationship. The problem for me is we're on month 2, month 3 is comming and I am worried about our communication. I think it's a really important matter in building something healthy, but now i just feel the chasing for my looks (?)

We don't share a lot of interest, we don't listen to the same music and don't have the same taste but I feeling very chilling with Him, like this feeling I've known him very well for a long time now.

I love texting and we text everyday, but i have a very strong feeling it's not gonna work for a long term and that feeling is killing me.

Please can you give me some advice? I don't want to hurt people, maybe I talk to him for serious this time, what he really wants and what is love for him? Because now I am in a situation where I am finding my love rules i guess.

Im new into this relationship thing it's my first, but it's His 3rd one. Maybe im overthinking i guess. 

The worst part is i met his best friends 😨 and I don't really want to see him cry because of me.

Damn we're scheluded for the next weekend and I'm worring very much because he's so loving for me, but I just don't know what to think",2,1740193211.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Minimum provincial wage. Administrative tasks and whatever else they want me to do. The job that people who got hired before left or rejected (for reasons i'm not quite sure of).

I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and PTSD. Trauma came from family members themselves. Mag one month palang ako as an ""official employee"" but I've been ""helping"" them do these since pandemic. Ngayon lang may actual salary and benefits. 

Wala lang, gusto ko lang siguro sabihin na nagwawala na yung inner child ko since for the longest time my daily mantra was that either I die at 19 (I did attempt, didn't succeed) or I graduate from college and leave asap. Sabi ko pa sa sarili ko mag iiwan lang ako pera sa kanila and di na magpapakita ever again. I was 7 years old when these became my main goals. I didn't plan the specifics of how I was going to do it (which I now regret!) but that childish thinking really kept me going for years I think. And now nandito na ako, at 24, the age where I'm supposed to be able to make that decision and yet still stuck in the same house that witnessed years of trauma, still working for the people that caused majority of those trauma.

No, they're not bad people. They give me shelter, food, education, and other materials na hindi naman basic need. I know I am privileged enough to be comfortable in terms of lifestyle. I know some people have it worse. I know my parents have changed a bit over the years in a sense na hindi na sila nag eexplode randomly at you kapag may problema sila with things na wala kang kinalaman. Hindi na sila nananakit or nagsisira ng gamit sa bahay. Mental gymnastics nalang ngayon. Entitlement sa oras at mga decision mo. Will throw you under the bus in front of other people if they get criticized or cause a minor inconvenience para sa ibang tao. Gaslighting you into thinking na you're not doing enough ""real"" work and therefore can't be saying ""no"" to more work or proper compensation. Micromanaging. Constant negative criticism and giving unwarranted advice na hindi rin naman applicable sa kanila. 

Anyway, kaya lang naman ako pumayag mag work here is because I was not able to save money from my allowance. I decided to be happy on my last few months living on campus and that meant spending on good food, good coffee, skincare, and occasional na social drinking. Some of them went to emergency medical needs ko na I refuse to talk to my parents about kasi I'm not comfortable talking to them about my health. Psychiatric needs ko lang ang aware sila kasi the costs of check ups and meds are too heavy for me. 

I decided to work for them so I can have money for my health needs ulit kasi hindi priority for them spending money on it. Blood tests since I've been taking meds, dental check ups, OB. I can't afford these without work and I needed money asap. Pero kaluluwa ko talaga kapalit nito hahaha.

She lost track of time, 30 minutes late. I finally got there on time, and I didn't mind the wait.

When she arrived, she lit a cigarette the moment her hands could reach for one, her trembling hands.

I looked down at my own hands, they don’t shake like that anymore, like they did before.

She offered me one too. She probably wouldn't believe me if I had suddenly declined, and had stopped smoking too. That I -could- stop. She can be right at times.

A declined cigarette? I don't know if that's something I'll ever do.

After we were done, we stepped inside. I saw her eyes glimpse at the table in the back corner. Somewhere to hide.

But I'd rather sit somewhere else, so I asked her; “How about next to a window? In the sun? Somewhere with a view?”

I watched as her eyes started filling with fear. And I remember feeling it, so clear. ""I don't belong here, and all out in the open too.""

She did agree, and before sitting down, she told me she had to go to the restroom, really quick. And as I had expected, her eyes, watery and thick. While she was in the bathroom, I grabbed the menu and read it. Really read it. I can’t recall the last time I really did, so I felt proud, even if it was just for a little bit.

Because I am sober now, and I understand she isn't there yet. I didn’t expect her to be, and ofcourse I didn't expect her to be hungry. I still struggle with that too, but now, it's all just so differently.

Before me I see a broken, fragile, bruised, 17 year old girl. The first question she asked me was; “Why are we still here, alive, walking this world?”.

And I wish I could tell her how it will all be okay. Wrap my arms around her, give her a hug, and be sincere. One where she doesn't need to feel fear.

One she so desperately craves from her mother. To let her know, she is anything but a bother.

And maybe I need one too. I wish I could tell her to look out, “this isn’t the way it all has to be!” But, I know me.",7,1740192937.0,poeticgarden,0,1.0,False

Name: ""Unknown"" Pyxmies, also known as Dr. Pyxmies, or Sub

Dr. Pyxmies, also known as Sub, was a scientist during the end stages a war, studying something he called ""The Subspace"". The Subspace was a strange thing, it didn't like being compressed, or would it like being expanded. If either of those 2 happened, the core of the Subspace would detonate. Yet, somehow, some way, he figures out how to extract the core from a Subspace, causing the core to freak out, and seek a new host. That host being him. The Subspace began to take over his body, slowly, but surely. He quickly finds a way to slow this process down, and by alot, almost to a stop. By using the cores of the other Subspaces he had nearby, he created a inhibitor, 3 to be exact. Ever since, he's been researching the Subspace, using other living Robloxians as test subjects for his greatest invention yet, The Subspace Tripmine. He had been honing and perfecting his research for 90 years, since he was 27. But he didn't look like an 117 year old, he was stuck as his 27 year old self ever since the Subspace began corrupting him. 

Fun Facts: He isn't a physical fighter, but will use his intelligence to outplay you
He can enter the Subspace, making him invulnerable to anything, he doesn't do it much however
He like black coffee
He's gone Insane/Crazy after all this time
He can die, just not of old age

1iv8o7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iv8o7f/aita_for_prolonging_a_prank_because_i_enjoy_the/,AITA for prolonging a prank because I enjoy the 'princess' benefits that resulted from it?,"Okay, so I (38f) created this account specifically to ask this question, because I listen to a lot of the stories online, and the time has come for me to face my public judgement as my friends are equally divided on what happened.

It started out as a silly suggestion by my friend (34f) who I will call Kit.

Kit was speaking to some people at her workplace, and they were laughing about how they had pranked their partners with a simple line: ""Are you busy next Thursday?""

To be clear, the day of the week doesn't matter. You pick a day when you know your partner is busy doing something else, ask the question, and look mildly crestfallen when they say they have plans - generally done later in the evening so that in the morning, it can be revealed that you were messing with them, and 'everybody in the starbucks cheers'.

Kit was telling me and my sister (also 34f, who I will call Chi) about some of the funny reactions the partners had to her work folks, and it devolved, as these things do, into speculations about how partners/family members/friends might react if we did this to them. ""He would shrug it off"", ""she would just get annoyed"", ""the panic would be sooo real"".

There was a general encouragement from Chi and Kit that my husband would fall for it, as Chi doesn't currently have a partner, and Kit's husband would be oblivious.

The wine was flowing, as was the laughter, and it was all just a bit of fun... and the fun stayed with me when I arrived home a few hours later. My husband (39m) was getting ready to go out and meet with his friends, waiting for me to get in before he went as we have kids on the younger side.

I came in as usual, greeted him and he grabbed his coat to go - that was when it struck me. I knew he was going out Thursday evening with 'the boys', so I let my intrusive thoughts win, because it was just a prank, right? ""What are you doing next Thursday?""

He recounted his plans, and with all the limited acting skill I possessed, I made a lightly disappointed face, and said: ""Okay. Have a good night."" then headed upstairs, holding back a smirk at the slightly worried look on his face.

In the morning, he asked me what was happening on Thursday, and I recalled the events of the night before. That was the point at which I should have said ""Just messing!"" and laid it to rest, but once again, the intrusive though won and instead I said: ""It doesn't matter, don't worry."" - I didn't go out of my way to sound disappointed or anything, just waved it off.

In my head, it was just a continuation of the joke, and I would tell him later in the day. After all, beyond a brief look of confusion, I hadn't had much of a reaction when I said it, and the selfish part of myself wanted to have a funny story to add to the pile next time I met with my ladies.

The next thing I know, I am being directed to a bath. Not just any bath: the romantic movie scene bath with scented bath bomb, candles, soft music emanating from the bluetooth speaker (a band that my husband hates, but he knows I love), and a mug of coffee on the tray unit thingy over the bath.

Now, THIS was when I should have told him it was a joke, and that he was very sweet to have gone to all the effort, and there was still a chance that he would have laughed. But I didn't. Hindsight is 20/20.

I was just so excited to relax in this picture perfect setting that I kissed him, thanked him, and climbed on in.

But then, it escalated.

I had the bath, got dried and dressed in my favourite loungewear (which was laid out on the bed when I got out of the bath) and settled at my PC, intending to watch an episode of my favourite show when my husband appeared behind me again: ""You can watch it downstairs. I'm taking the kids on a walk so you can just relax.""

I almost never get time alone at home, and am used to spending time in my quiet corner to watch my not-child-friendly shows (I love a serial killer doc, for example), so this was very welcome news. An hour later - enough time for me to watch two episodes - they return armed with shopping bags.

He had bought all my favourite foods to make dinner, and a bottle of my favourite wine (which is a luxury because while it isn't excessively expensive, it's more than I like to spend, and it's not something I would buy if it wasn't a special occasion).

I texted my 'results' to Kit and Chi, and a few other people, giving a loose outline of what happened, and the feedback has been mixed, some saying that it is funny and telling him tomorrow morning will be a laugh, and others saying that he will be angry because I, basically, manipulated him by not explaining sooner.

So I'm sat here now, smelling like a rose garden, in soft fabrics, full of pasta and enjoying a glass of vino after an afternoon on the couch, scared half to death that this overplayed prank is going to backfire and wanting to know: AITA?",0,1740192336.0,AITAH,20,0.3,False

The staff is generally amazing, but the old saying “you get what you pay for” certainly holds true for MSC. Yes, some things are out of their control, and our cruise was impacted by weather.
But, as someone who works full time, my time off is the most important thing to me, this cruise just had too many hiccups to say it was ‘worth it’.

We were delayed by a storm, which led to a delay in getting to what would have been a very late Cape Canaveral arrival. So the Captain decided to alter the itinerary. We reacted by frantically adjusting our excursions. A day or so later, we had that port of call cancelled. Again, that stinks but oh well I guess.

A day later and we start noticing things are wierd. Staff is not very happy, no milk (yes no milk for coffee), no eggs, no yogurt, cheeses, salad, fresh fruit etc etc etc.

Come to find out the missed port was also the point where they would have resupplied. Also… the crew was not happy apparently because they had not been eating! Talk about guilt as a passenger… though I am not sure how true this really is.

Then they ran out of bottled water! To finish it all off my son then started having stomach issues, can’t say why for sure, but we are all in close proximity and no one else got sick, so take your own guesses. We are trying to keep him hydrated which has been a challenge. We used a mini bar water and replaced with water we bought on shore (we bought a case on shore and brought it back on the boat!). The cabin person decided to let my wife know we would be charged for it anyway. Whatever $4, on an $8k vacation is nothing, but the premise is still there. Was going to top him separately before this but that gets scratched off course.

They try to nickel and dime you at every turn.

So is MSC worth it? I would say no, not if you value your vacation time / want good food and premium entertainment. One and done.",0,1740192274.0,Cruise,12,0.5,False

There’s about a $300 price difference between the two, and I’m trying to determine whether the Philos is worth the extra cost over the Mignon Oro SD Pro.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

In the beginning, we were so in love - like we had finally met our person after so many failed relationships. There was a fairy tale like narrative to our relationship. Our first date lasted 12 hours. Within one month, she “accidentally” told me that she loved me.
She suffered from chronic illness and depression, and before she met me she was active in the kink community. She assured me that kink was not something she needed any longer, and all of her kink relationships had been very abusive. (Not saying that all are, but hers were.)
Within a few months of our relationship, she began to sexually distance herself. She told me it was because she had started her fast tracked masters program and was overwhelmed. Later, she told me that because of her chronic illness and all of the medications she was on, she was no longer capable of the same sexual experience she’d had in the past, and it was a testament to her attraction to me that she had interest in sex at all. Later, it came out that her kinky abusive partners before me were the sexual highlight of her life and were better sex, and when I tried to ask how I could satisfy her, she wouldn’t be upfront and tell me because I wasn’t “naturally kinky.” I began to shut down sexually because it felt like a huge rejection and felt awful. We were still so in love, and when I look back at pictures I can see the love for me in her eyes. The pandemic began, and she began to become depressed. She gained a bunch of weight because of a new medication and felt out of touch with herself. We still loved each other and seemed to be very happy to be with eachother. She began to spiral into depression and told me it was just part of her life and would be something that would come and go . She became incredible agoraphobic and would not leave the house to go anywhere or do anything with anyone, stating her chronic illness as the reason, which I felt I could not challenge. So she had only 2 active friendships, she was unwilling to go to social events or dates and made a huge fuss for obligatory events like birthdays and Christmas, and we were not having any new experiences together. I felt like our life together consisted of me doing things on my own and interacting with her inside of our home, the only place she wanted to be. I remember her crying and telling me this was the happiest she’d ever been and that she was so happy that she didn’t give in to suicidal ideations so she could experience her life with me. She proposed to me 4.5 years ago, and after Trump was elected, she insisted that we rush our marriage and get legally married before he took office. We made plans to get legally married and had our immediate family involved in our plans. 2 weeks before the wedding, after she had gone home for thanksgiving for 4 days, she returned and called the wedding off out of nowhere. She told me that we had just become friends and companionate, because we didn’t have sex, and that she had decided to be more masculine (she is trans and constantly changing her gender expression) and that she needed to be part of the kink community. She told me we had just become best friends, but then after I had a panic attack 3 days later, she told me that my processing the abrupt end of our relationship was too rough for her and she completely withdrew. I had to replace almost everything because her family was wealthy and bought her house, and over the course of our relationship we got rid of almost all of my household things: bed, bed frame, couch, coffee table, dishes, silverware etc. When she abruptly ended our relationship, I told her I was taking $2k from our joint account to cover some
Of my moving expenses (it literally only covered my first months rent/deposit and a mattress), and she later came back at me that her mother was mad at me and that she was “icked out that it was all about the money for me.”
She said she wanted to remain friends but was cold, distant, spacious and bread crumbing. A month before our breakup, she (a therapist) told me she ended the therapeutic relationship with a new client because they “knew what this was” and that they had too much in common/ too much of a vibe to be in a therapeutic relationship ship: she said they were best friend material. I think this was inappropriate and strange, and in the beginning of our breakup I asked if she was seeing this person. She said “please don’t assume that I’m an asshole.” Maybe she isn’t seeing him. I have no idea what to think. Up until 3 days before she broke up with me, she was insisting on and planning our wedding. I have almost 6 years of text messages of her telling me how much she loves me and wants to spend her life with me. And in 3 days, she changed her mind and changed the entire narrative of our relationship. 2 months after our breakup, I sent a long therapist approved letter stating my experience of our relationship and the inconsistency of what she told me for 5.5 years verses what she told me when she ended our relationship: I told her I need an apology from her to be able to offer friendship. I haven’t heard a reply in over a month.
How could someone do this? Who could justify this kind of behavior? I feel like I am on the edge of losing my mind. I am so devastated and she seemingly literally doesn’t give a shit. I compromised so much for this person to accommodate her issues and illnesses, and she literally threw me in the trash with no warning and didn’t look back.

We met up for coffee a week later and then i started to have my suspicions. I snooped at her facebook and I found out she's not only taken, but she's engaged.

We continued talking and have since met up for a dine-in movie and coffee a few times. I gave her really good christmas/bday presents too.

So about her being engaged, yeah she's never told me directly. If I didnt snoop, for all I know I could think he's a family member the few times she's posted him. I've made that mistake before.

Yesterday, we hung out all day at a amusement park. Just us. And I was hoping to talk a bit about some truths, boundaries. But we didnt. I didnt want to make things awkward. I think she would say she's engaged if I asked. But she also avoids talking about him to me.

Cause when she picked me up (I can drive, but it worked out better she drove) she got a call from ""Baby"" and she quickly ended the call and texted him. But she talks to her sister on the phone.

Her relationship is currently long distance. Hey, if he's okay with me - more power to them. But I don't know if he knows about me just as how she doesnt tell me about him.

We didn't talk about boundaries, her fiance or my own feelings about her but I did try to make the first step towards defining our friendship moving forward by saying we have a ""close cousins"" type of relationship. She agreed.

I’m a long time fan and subscriber (been here since the T days) and have been wanting to share some of my favorite paranormal experiences. This experience in particular is one I thought I had made up. That was until years later, when the friend involved confirmed that it, had indeed, happened. I have several so I’ll share more if everyone likes this one!! 

I grew up in a highly religious family in Wyoming. The morbid and morose were always highly taboo. But every October my mom and I would throw big Halloween parties (my dad hated it but mom always won that argument) and reserved the entire month to binge watch every ghost hunter show we could. 
This was around the time that I became fast friends with Dee. She was by far the coolest person I had ever met. She was obsessed with all things spooky which I found exhilarating. Finally, I could explore all the paranormal and supernatural things that I was never allowed to normally! 
The one time I was allowed to spend the night at her house was something I will never forget! 
We were eating classic sleep over foods; pizza, soda, and the stash of candy her mom had obviously hidden for herself. While we’d been rooting around in areas of the house we shouldn’t have been we found an ouija board. Dee eventually convinced me to try it. So we set it up on the pizza box in the middle of the coffee table and set the planchet down. 
When I say the temperature changed in the room, the second i touched it, I mean it. And it seemed to be only affecting me. Suddenly I was insanely thirsty and felt like I had been walking around in a theme park in the summer. I remember Dee asking me if i was okay. Of course I lied and kept my hands engaged with the game. We waited for a while but nothing was happening. Even when we tried moving the planchet ourselves it was like pushing it through oobleck (that weird goo you get when you mix cornstarch and water). After a few minutes I couldn’t stand it and I practically ran to the kitchen to get water. As soon as I was in the other room I felt better, I didn’t feel like i was in a hot tent anymore and i could breathe again. I went to the sink to get some water, hoping to get my pulse under control. 
Dee was still in the other room. As soon as I had my back turned she yelled “hey”. Thinking she was mad at me (the way she had said it sounded strange) I was about to suggest we do something else. Just in time to see the planchet flying straight at me. I felt the wind it made as it slammed into the wall next to me. Dee hadn’t moved. All of the color had drained out of her face and she was just sat at the coffee table shaking. All the hair on my body was standing straight up, it was so scary. 
I didn’t even think when I grabbed the planchet from where it had landed on the counter and threw it out the kitchen window behind the sink. 
I grabbed my backpack off the couch, mumbled something about seeing Dee at school later, and left. I walked 4 blocks to the nearby church and called my mom on my flip phone, begging her to come get me. And because my life is comically sitcom-like it, of course,  started raining while I stood there and waited for my mom. 
I got insanely sick. So sick I spent nearly a week stuck in bed. Basically unconscious. I literally couldn’t speak, due to tonsillitis and a random antibiotic resistant re-occurring strep infection, for nearly a month, and I ended up having to get my tonsils out. And the ring finger on my right hand got a crazy infection that sent me to the ER and had to be lanced in order to keep me from losing my finger. Anyone wanna guess which hand I used to throw the planchet out the window? 
I don’t think I ever spoke to Dee in person again. When we talked years later (on facebook) she told me that everything was so bad at the house afterwards. She and her family moved because her dad lost his job, her parents got divorced, I think one of her grandparents died like 6 months later (they lived with them at the time). We never really regained our friendship either. On a cooler note though, ever since I recovered from my illness I have been able to see peoples auras. So I guess fun perk.
