We’ve been together for nine months and we were living together before in a flat that costs £1,200 per month. We were paying £600 each. 

This new one is £1875 per month. I told her before we moved that my budget was £600 per month and I couldn’t afford a more expensive place. She insisted it was fine and she will pay the extra since she really wanted this particular flat. A week after we’ve moved in and she’s already telling me that the flat is “hers” and basically saying I have to do things her way. 

Last night we were laying in bed and we were woke up by the kitten at 5am. She has insomnia so she couldn’t get back to sleep and started playing a show on her phone. The noise was pretty loud so now I also couldn’t sleep so she went in the living room. I came in the living room and told her to stay in the bedroom while I went and slept in the spare bedroom so we were both comfy. She insisted I go back in the original bedroom whilst she went back into the living room to listen to her show. 

I fell asleep at this point and when I woke up at 10am I came in the living room and she was asleep. The living room was extremely hot where she’d left the heaters on full blast all night so I turned them off and opened a window. The living room is where the kitchen is so I made myself a coffee and sat on the computer. 

She woke up in a hot rage because I woke her up and started shouting at me, slamming doors and being extremely hostile towards me. She stormed off into the bedroom but then came back to shout at me some more while she got her weed. She said “I’ll make sure you don’t sleep tonight” At this point I couldn’t help but retaliate and shout back because it felt unfair to be treated this way when the living room is a shared space. 

I quickly stopped myself and calmed myself down by playing some peaceful music. Whilst she was yelling in my face, I just ignored her and she went away and turned the WiFi off. I went and calmly turned it back on. 

Then she came back out into the room to yell at me to turn the calming music off, even though it was playing ever so quietly so she couldn’t hear it in the other room. She insisted on turning it off, saying that “it’s my house”. When I refused to turn it off, she went and turned the WiFi off, unplugged it and hid it. 

Then I went in the other room to her because I was extremely annoyed at this point. I told her she’s mentally ill and then I sarcastically said “night night” before closing her door. 

She came out into a hot headed rage and told me to get out of her house and leave. She said she can’t live with me anymore. So I packed all my stuff, left it in the spare room and came out for a walk. 

This is a reoccurring pattern where she’s controlling, dismissive and manipulative. I feel like I’m constantly walking on egg shells.

1ilddj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ilddj3/my_healing_journey_from_gastritis_what_worked_for/,My Healing Journey from Gastritis – What Worked for Me,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my recovery journey from gastritis in hopes of helping someone going through the same struggle. I know how frustrating and painful it can be, but healing **is** possible! Here’s what made a difference for me.

# 1. Symptoms & How It Started

I first started experiencing **acid reflux, burning pain, and bloating** in August 2024 after taking an NSAID for a running-related knee injury. Initially, I tried to push through, but over time, my symptoms worsened, affecting my daily life, workouts, and even my mental health.

# 2. What Helped Me Heal

✅ **Quitting Caffeine** – This was **the hardest part for me**. I never imagined I could quit coffee, but I realized I didn’t need anything external to feel whole. Caffeine was keeping me disconnected from my body’s signals, and letting it go allowed my body to truly heal. Looking back, I’m grateful for this experience—it forced me to slow down, reflect, and take better care of myself.

✅ **Diet Changes** – I had to identify and eliminate trigger foods. While general guidelines exist, everyone’s body reacts differently. My safe foods included:

* Organic protein powder (to maintain muscle)
* Eggs, brown rice, chicken
* No tomatoes, spicy food, caffeine, or excessive sugar

✅ **Working Out & Doubling Down on Goals** – Instead of letting gastritis define me, I trained like I didn’t have it. I adjusted my workouts when needed but never stopped. I **treated my goals as non-negotiable**—I kept **training, building my business, and working on my vision**, despite the setbacks. The mind-body connection is real, and staying physically strong helped me push through mentally.

✅ **Lifestyle Adjustments** – Managing stress was key. I used **meditation, Stoicism, and journaling** to stay mentally strong. I also made big changes in my environment to reduce emotional stress.

✅ **Medications & Supplements** – After experimenting (and learning the hard way), I realized the importance of **trusting a good gastro doctor** and sticking to a plan. Some things I tried:

* **Zinc Carnosine** – Caused flares
* **Teecino & Lion’s Mane** – Didn’t work for me
* **Strict bland diet & cabbage juice** – **Game changers**

# 3. My Turning Point & Recovery

For me, **the biggest shift happened when I fully committed to the healing process**—strict diet, prioritizing mental health, and trusting my body to heal. It took **about six months**, but I gradually returned to normal eating and even coffee.

# 4. How I Reframed the Struggle

This journey wasn’t just about healing physically—it was about course-correcting my life. **I believe prayers helped, no matter what faith you have.** It brought me closer to God, back to my vision and purpose, and aligned me with my goals. In a way, this struggle became a blessing—it gave me the clarity and courage to make bold, life-altering moves.

# 5. Advice for Anyone Struggling

* **Your environment matters.** Reducing stress helped me heal faster.
* **Find what works for YOU.** Healing isn’t one-size-fits-all.
* **Trust your body.** Support it with the right food, habits, and mindset.
* **Don’t let your condition define you.** Keep working out and pursuing your goals as if you don’t have gastritis.
* **Stay patient & don’t lose hope.** You will get better!

I’m fully healed now, and if you’re struggling, feel free to ask me anything—I’d be happy to help!",1,1739102978.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

I was an intern, and he was a consultant with 5 years of industry experience. I was just starting out, and he had been there for two years. We both eventually left, and he later asked me to have coffee and offered me the opportunity to help him create a new agency. I agreed, and since August 2023, we’ve been working on it. The agency officially launched in September 2024.

From the start, he's assigned me different roles and set high expectations. If I don’t meet his expectations by the end of the day, he tells me I'm not trying hard enough. He compares me to his business partner, who’s been in the industry for 30 years, saying that when the partner sends out emails, he gets responses, but I don’t. When I do achieve something, he brushes it off and never gives praise. Instead, he criticizes every little thing I do.

He also tells me one thing, then the opposite the next day. For example, he says I’m not getting things done, disregarding the work I’ve actually completed. He criticized me for not getting enough responses from photographers and told the intern to start sending emails to prove a point. The intern got zero responses. Then, he told me I should be in contact with photographers to set up tests for the models. At first, it was two or three a month, but now it's upscaled to two a week. When I achieve this, it’s still never mentioned or acknowledged.

Every workday is a struggle, and honestly, I’m exhausted.

From the taker of copious \*Stupid little walks for my stupid mental health\*, I bring you this silly little post for my silly mental health. Available right now, on a phone in front of your face.







I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the past months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family or coworkers ask me what I’ve been up to, I don't really have anything to share.  I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.







I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!







You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.







I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.





I'm fully aware my post history might scare some people off. I decided not to make an alt account, because I'd rather scare off possible new friends straight away, rather than having to ""come clean"" later on. I'm open to talk about the things in my posts, and I'm also open to not talking about it at all; I just didn't want to hide it away. I've done that for a long time already, and I'm just on a bit of an explorative journey right now. Those posts are just a very small part of me though, so please don't let them dictate whether you do or don't reach out!

It’s been here for about 3 weeks and both my housemate and I have ADHD and can’t remember when it appeared or why we didn’t clean it up immediately. Since then it has turned kind of shiny, not at all tacky and can’t really be scraped. 

It is most likely either:
- coffee
- soy sauce
- bong water/something to do with my housemate’s pipe

I have tried soaking with most the cleaning supplies I have to hand, including:
- generic antibacterial kitchen spray
- boiling water and soap
- bleach spray 
- rubbing alcohol

I have also tried scrubbing with:
- generic dish washing sponge
- scrub daddy
- a nail brush

Any suggestions on what else I could try? Ideally something that won’t also rub the print off but I’m not overly precious about that as it’s not over any actual writing.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

1ild225,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1ild225/f4f_lets_create_a_fantasy_epic_in_an_urban/,[F4F] Let's create a fantasy epic in an urban fantasy world! [Discord][Adv.lit.],"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story!

For the first few years, I just read comments and gained a feeling of connection knowing I wasn’t alone experiencing my lupus symptoms. As an SLE and Lupus Nephritis diagnosed woman of mixed race, I wanted to learn and listen before commenting. 

About 8 months ago, after my symptoms had continued to worsen despite being on medication, I decided to get 100% serious about taking a holistic approach to my health. I made drastic dietary and lifestyle changes, and had already spent the last few years working through emotional issues. 

My labs, within just 3 months, started showing drastic improvement. For the first time. IN FIVE YEARS. After another few months of learning, building on years of trial and error, I excitedly went to share my experiences in this community and was completely shocked by the amount of negativity and bitterness I experienced. I was absolutely bashed for promoting holistic therapies. Mind you— I have two masters degrees and have spent a lifetime learning. I’ve also been through hell as my symptoms were very severe for a long time.

In addition to being told that what I have direct experience with was “shit” by another redditor, I was directly told that “drugs are the only way”. I was removed for talking about dangerous therapies because I mentioned that coffee enemas had really helped my gut microbiome and that I was considering trying high dose vitamin d under supervision. Mind you, considering—under supervision lol! There was SO MUCH fear mongering that I was honestly shocked. I realize that a lot of people in this community are terrified of taking more responsibility over their diet and lifestyle, are traumatized from years of things not working, and are afraid to look deeper about the West’s very limited and heavily drug reliant perspective on health. Mind you, I’m on medication as well, and respect and appreciate my doctors! However, I would be lying if I said that the meds alone fixed things. They were about 25% of the story for me. 

The community I’m starting is called HolisticLupus. Rather than fighting with people who aren’t able to or comfortable with looking deeper, I’m creating a space where folks who believe healing is possible can discuss lifestyle changes, diets, supplements, detoxing and direct experiences of individuals who combine therapies with Western Medicine. I really hope some folx on here haven’t lost hope, and I’m excited to continue to explore what it means to recreate our lives no matter what we’ve been through <3 love to everyone triumphing over this 🌸",1,1739101730.0,HolisticLupus,0,1.0,False
1ild20g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ild20g,Bronco Off Roadeo TN,"Back in December(sorry for just getting around to posting this) the wife and I did the Bronco Off Roadeo in TN. First, let me say what a fantastic experience! It was a ton of fun! We had a diverse group with various backgrounds. Our tour guide, Chris, was highly knowledgeable and made the setting relaxing yet fun. I'm not going to lie; I was nervous as I’ve been driving a Chrysler 300 for 10 years, and my experience was minimal. But that didn’t matter. They guide you through the situations, and while some might be challenging, there is nothing too far out of reach. The week of our trip it had rained pretty well and the ground was soft and muddy. Driving the horse pasture was probably the most fun as you could drift through the mud. Several times we went over creeks, over rock formations and down hills. It's tons of fun, and I would highly recommend the experience. Seeing what these Bronco Sports are capable of was an eye opening experience. I’m thoroughly impressed.
Our drive back home was through the Smokey mountains, and what a beautiful drive. Glad I was able to drive my Bronco around the mountains. 

Here are a few tips and info 
They serve lunch and dinner, which is well catered by a local restaurant called The Abby. I was impressed by the food, as I thought it was going to be like a bag lunch. 
Bring a water bottle, but remember you will be on the trail, and facilities are limited. 
We stayed in Townsend at Little Arrow. It's a great place, and I can’t say enough good things about it. Seriously the tiny house was perfect for my wife and I and it was super chill. Maybe because it was December. 
Townsend itself is quiet and very beautiful. Several good restaurants, a brewery and a distillery. Really good coffee shops as well. 
If you are making a weekend out of it, check out the Dancing Bear Bristo; sweet tea pork chop is a must. They made the clean plate club which is an high honor for me and restaurants haha. 
Relax, Have fun and Respect nature. I took it a bit too seriously at first, but once I loosed up, it was a blast 
It’s tough to get pictures while on the trail; one of the guys brought a GoPro, and his buddy would get out and take photos of them competing parts of the trail with a high-quality camera. I wish I had thought of that. Even though my wife was with me, we didn’t plan that very well. ",3,1739101726.0,BroncoSport,0,1.0,False

Build : even though it's cheap knockoff build quality is really good heafty as hell and is built with quite high quality plastic. All the funnel scoop tamp shit which comes with this is really bad quality and it's not useful I don't think they should include it. 

Filter paper are good they send 500 and they can go 4-5+yrs for me if they don't go bad, also I quite like the quality of paper holder, so everything which is useful have good quality. The metal disc they ship with this is a really great addition, cause brewing with it and paper filters is better than only using paper filters, though I won't recommend brewing with only metal filter without paper.

Workflow is just as same as aeropress as it's designed to be.

About this vs v60 brews: I feel this is more idiot proof than v60 and can brew consistently good cups with good clarity, and sweetness when you have good coffee and water. Been brewing light roasts only so cannot say much about performance of darker roasts. Though it never really outperformed my cups with v60 when I do not mistakes. I still think I enjoy brewing with v60 more cause it's high risk high reward quality, and also I can play with many equipment but that's just me.

1ilcy2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1ilcy2e/maybe_this_was_the_beginning_saga_continues/,Maybe this was the beginning- saga continues,"Naomi was visiting us. She had a way of making everything seem like a mix between cozy and unnerving. Last night, as Vicky and I were wrapped up in the warmth of our bed, something felt... off. The room was dim, the kind of dim where shadows feel like they’re watching you, and I swear, I could feel eyes on us. It was a sensation I couldn’t shake, like a pair of invisible eyes drilling into the back of my skull. But Vicky, in her usual effortless way, kept my thoughts occupied. The warmth of her skin, the softness of her lips..., soon slipping into a dreamless, blissful ‘post-match with extra time’ sleep in her arms.

But as the night stretched on, I couldn't quite rid myself of the nagging feeling. The kind of feeling that keeps you up but only in the quietest corners of your mind. It was almost as if something—someone—was waiting. Maybe it was Naomi, lurking in the doorway, playing some twisted game of ""peek-a-boo."" But no. It had to be the mind playing tricks, right?

Morning would come early.

It was early on a Monday morning, the kind of morning that makes you question your life choices as you stare at the blaring alarm clock, daring it to be more obnoxious. I had the day off, but of course, Vicky had to drag herself out of bed for college. She’s one of those people who actually likes getting up early—ugh, I know.

The alarm went off with its usual irritating beep, and I nudged Vicky awake, groggily reminding her it was time for her to get ready for school. Since I was the lucky one with the day off, I pulled the blanket over my head and decided to treat myself to the luxury of sleeping in. In my mind, I could almost hear the sound of the bed whispering, ""Come, embrace the sweet oblivion of sleep.""

Vicky kissed me goodbye, the soft, sleepy kind of kiss that says, “I’ll miss you, but I’m also going to get coffee and probably skip the afternoon lecture.” With a yawn and a stretch, she left me to my peaceful, self-indulgent slumber.

Or so I thought.

I must’ve drifted back into a deep sleep, because the next thing I knew—snap!—I was suddenly wide awake. My heart was racing. I could feel the warm pressure of someone beside me. My eyes flickered open in the dark, and there she was. Vicky. Crawling back into bed beside me.

Now, mind you, it’s not unusual for her to sneak back in sometimes, especially if she forgot her phone or her keys, but this time felt different. My brain was trying to catch up as I blinked and squinted into the dim light. She was lying there on her left side, nude, facing away from me. I could see the outline of her body, the familiar curves.

I snuggled up behind her and asked, ""You decided not to go to school today?""

She just replied, ""Mmmm hmmm.""

Based on the tone of her sensual voice, Mandella started getting excited and begged to be released from prison. I reached around her and grabbed a handful of her. They felt amazing, and Mandela throbbing. While doing that, I became aware her perfume smelled different than what I was used to.

I asked her, ""Babe, are you wearing some new perfume?""

Again, her reply was just, ""Mmm hmmm.""

Mandela was rock hard against her smooth ass cheeks. I couldn’t help myself—I started nuzzling Vicky’s neck. It’s always been my favorite spot, that soft, delicate curve where her pulse beats just under the skin. She’s always been sensitive there, like she could practically melt into my arms with just a soft kiss or a gentle graze of my lips. That’s what I was expecting, the usual electric shiver down her spine, the soft hum of contentment, and that look—the one where she’s half-giggling, half-sighing.

But this time? This time it felt... different.

At first, I thought maybe I was just half asleep, not fully in tune with the moment. But as I nuzzled her skin again, my lips brushing the edge of her neck, something was off. A strange coolness under my touch. Her skin felt... too smooth. I pulled back for a second, blinking into the dim light of the room.

It was still Vicky, right? It had to be. I could feel the rise and fall of her breath beneath me. But something was wrong.

I gently moved my hand from her neck to the back of her head, intending to pull her closer, but the second my fingers touched her hair—wait a minute. I froze. Her hair—it wasn’t long. In fact, it wasn’t even shoulder-length anymore. It was... short.

Not just short—very short. It barely reached her earlobes.

I blinked again, my mind trying to catch up. Vicky had always had long, flowing hair, something she’d been stubborn about ever since I met her. She would never—never—cut it that short.

“Vicky?” My voice cracked as I pulled back, eyes scanning her face in confusion.

Puzzled, I asked her, ""Did Naomi just cut your hair?""

She simply replied, ""Un uhh.""

I was so turned on, but I didn't connect the dots yet. My fingers did the walking towards her honeypot, but my fingers found it slippery, just smooth, shaved skin. Now I was really bewildered. Vicky shaved her down under once and complained about how it itched when the hair grew back. Then the realization hit me.

""Naomi?"" I asked.

She replied, ""Yes.""

I asked her, ""What are you doing in my bed? This is so wrong!""",2,1739101274.0,nairobi,1,1.0,False

Recipe:  
1 3/4 cups Fairlife 2% milk  
2 tbsp. sugar free Maple Grove syrup  
1 tbsp. instant coffee (I used Cafe Bustelo Espresso instant coffee)  
1 teaspoon vanilla  
2 scoops (36g) of coffee protein powder. ( I used Chike brand mocha iced coffee.)  
1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum. (Not sure if this is needed but I put it in regardless.)

I processed on Light Ice Cream (first photo) which was fine, but I did a re-spin for a soft serve consistency (second photo).

This recipe is something I put together after searching many other recipes. If anyone has a better recipe or ideas for tweaking this one, I would love to know!

Note: The Chike brand coffee protein that I used is not something everyone has and is quite expensive compared to other protein powders. I would look into the Premier Protein 'Cafe Latte' flavored powder as an alternative.

My question: I still don't know what xanthan gum does. Many 'Coffee Ice Cream' recipes do not have this ingredient, but I put it in mine as my thought process is what can 1/8th of a teaspoon hurt? Is it really needed in this recipe?

1ilcvpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ilcvpt/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_girlfriends_friends/,AITA for not paying for my girlfriend’s friends’ coffee during our first meeting?,"I (M33) and my girlfriend (F31) have been dating for 5 months. We’ve reached the stage where we’re introducing each other to our friends, usually by playing social games or going out for coffee (which is a cultural norm in my country, South West Europe).

Here’s where the issue comes in: When I invite my girlfriend to meet *my* friends, I take the initiative and cover the expenses, whether it’s for one friend or five. I’ve openly discussed with her that if she introduces me to her family (like her sister or parents), I expect her to take the initiative and cover the costs for dinner or coffee. However, she doesn’t seem to understand this perspective. She believes it’s the man’s role to cover these expenses as a sign of being a “gentleman” and not putting her in an “inconvenient” position.

I asked her what she would expect if I met her friends (whether it’s one or five of them). Since she’s the one initiating the introduction, shouldn’t she cover the expenses? She responded that she expects *me* to pay for the coffee during the first meeting to show her friends that I’m a “gentleman.” For any future meetings with her friends, she wouldn’t expect me to pay. This doesn’t make sense to me—why should I only be a “gentleman” on the first meeting and not afterward?

I want an equal partnership where I don’t feel pressured to conform to traditional gender roles just to prove my affection. My girlfriend is more traditional, and I feel like she’s trying to impose these expectations on me.

So, AITA for not meeting her expectations and refusing to pay for her friends’ coffee during our first meeting?",1,1739101003.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

In some dramas ML are not just neutral but quite rude when interacting with others, especially girls. 

Examples:
- Everyone loves me. ML is so unnecessary rude to FL before he finds out that she’s that girl he likes from the gaming chat. 
- Legally Romance. When FL thinks that all is lost and ML doesn’t love her because he helps SFL when she got burnt by hot tea. 
- Here we meet again. When FL sees ML taking a cup of coffee from another girl and she thinks that’s the end of the world and he doesn’t love her.

I also see people specifically looking for dramas with ML being nice only to FL etc. 

Is it a cultural thing? I’d say it’s a red flag if your man is unnecessarily rude or unkind to other people, no matter their gender.

a new coffee shop opened at the mall near me. Bf and I went shopping and noticed there's a massive line wrapped 3 times around the stairway of the mall for this place.

Everyone in line is (zoomer? Alpha?) tik-tok teen coded. The line had to at least be 1 hour minimum in wait.  

Look.. I dont.. care about this stuff.  If this was like.. a photo op pop up... i'd actually completely get it. I'm not confused by influencers...

But I was really confused, my bf was too.  It was looking kinda manic.. like.. its just coffee.  There's 2 more coffee shops on the 1st floor.  People were in line, jumping up and down, after people finally got their coffee they were holding it up like a trophy and cheering.. 

So we look it up.  Some ytube influencer mogul? The article I was reading was writing it like I was supposed to have known who she was and had followed her entire story.  I have never heard of this person in my entire life.  

In fact.. her popularity is so contained on youtube/tik tok(?) that I literally couldnt find any more info about her. Just that theyre an influencer and have quirky videos.  

Her instagram post about her store opening had 1 million likes

I guess I was like.. there is literally no way that I'm standing in line for 2 hours to get a regular latte.  The latte better cause me to bust a 🌰🥜.  


So yeah.. I felt old. And grumpy. And confused.  Lol. Anyone know who tf this is? Is the coffee worth the mania?

- Clean out insulated cup

For me, I’m a fan of -

-68K
-Buffalo Coffee Brewers
-Warings Lifestore 
-Alchemista Coffee Potions
-Bar Marzano 
-Fika

I like 68K for the vibes/music, and the gentleman who runs it is a lovely guy. He seems to really know his stuff. He’s the Brian Cox of coffee. Coffee is really good.

I like Buffalo Coffee Brewers because of the quality and taste of the coffee also the atmosphere, I really like that there is no counter, so it’s a really friendly casual inclusive vibe. And the guys who run it again are sound.

Warings, I'm not too concerned about the coffee. I just am a big fan of the location and the seating etc inside, the beams, the lighting, the windows.

I like Alchemista Coffee Potions, again, not so much about the coffee itself. But I like the views, the location, and the interior.

Bar Marzano, coffee is standard but decent, but it’s a great location for people watching, I can sometimes sit for hours here, reading, or working.

Finally Fika, charming little place, really unique, great coffee, and great service, very intimate vibe, nice to chat with the gentleman who’s business it is, seems very knowledgeable about most things, not just coffee, love his social media, really interesting photos he posts promoting the business.

I lived in foster care most of my life and have lived with many a roommate before. I've shared rooms, houses, beds, you name it. Foster care has done it. Anyways, I was about to be kicked out of a group home I lived in at age 19 (you can be in foster care 'till you're 21 in KS, in case you didn't know) to be taken to a PRTF, a sort of mental facility that cuts you off from the outside world completely. I've lived in them before, and I know they can be helpful for some folks, but not most foster kids. the crazy only breeds more crazy. Kids who are in there to genuinely get better get mixed up in the shenanigans of the other lil hooligans and all devolves into chaos. Needless to say, as a 19 year old with PTSD, I did not want to get strip searched (yes they do that for kids, no it's not illegal, they do it to check if you have weapons or contraband) every day until I'm 21. So I called up a friend, called my social worker, and arranged for him to get me that night and submit my discharge letter. He was really enthusiastic about moving in with me, but immediately I started noticing problems. He would try to get intimate with me on my FIRST NIGHT, and as I explained I wasn't emotionally ready to consent, he kept pushing boundaries. As a result, I stuck in my room like a little hermit crab. I haven't stayed in the living room for over an hour in months. I eat in my room. I sleep in my room. I order takeout in my room. 

I'm still struggling to get a job, and he's getting increasingly frustrated at me over it. His mom was in town last week, and he asked me to clean up around the house. So I confusedly poured out old coffee that was mine, you know when you just have it sitting in the coffee maker? yea I poured that out, and then just kinda sat there confused and went back to my room. Like I said, I hadn't been outside my room much. I did clean the mildew covered toilet, though. Trust me, it was like that when I got here. His bathroom is covered in beard shavings and his tub is yellowed. Anyways, I then get a text that I'm not doing my part and not doing anything to help and I just get confused and say 'ok, I'll try to be better' but am I supposed to clean out his old ice cream containers that I didn't get a BITE of? I know there are things that I COULD have done, like take out the trash, or try to organize the table that he never sits at and just piles his stuff onto, but it wasn't my mess and I'll be honest I didn't FEEL like doing it!

Below is a script for a Gilmore Girls episode set after Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. It picks up where the revival left off, exploring Rory’s pregnancy, Lorelai’s evolving life, and the ever-charming town of Stars Hollow.

Gilmore Girls: A New Chapter

Episode Title: “New Lorelais on the Block”

TEASER

(Opening shot: Stars Hollow gazebo, early morning. Luke’s Diner is just opening, and Taylor is setting up a suspiciously large banner outside Doose’s Market.)

LORELAI (walking up with coffee from home)
Taylor, why is there a giant sign that says “Stars Hollow’s First Baby Boom of the New Era”?

TAYLOR (proudly)
Because, Lorelai, we are on the verge of a historic moment! Three Stars Hollow babies are on the way!

LORELAI (mock gasp)
What?! Who else is knocked up besides Rory?

TAYLOR
Ah-ah! I cannot reveal my sources. But let’s just say, the town stork is putting in overtime.

(Cut to Lorelai’s face of mixed amusement and horror. She takes a big gulp of coffee.)

ACT ONE

(Interior: Luke’s Diner. Rory is at the counter, flipping through a notebook. She’s trying to focus, but Babette and Miss Patty are hovering.)

BABETTE
So, Rory, tell us—have you thought about baby names? Because if it’s a boy, Babette is an excellent, gender-neutral option.

MISS PATTY
And if it’s a girl, think exotic! Something with flair! Esmeralda. Vivienne. Beyonce.

RORY (exasperated but smiling)
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I’m still wrapping my head around the fact that I’m having a baby.

LORELAI (entering)
Oh, trust me, kid, it never fully sinks in. One minute you’re pregnant, the next you’re debating whether to let your toddler eat an entire Pop-Tart for dinner.

(Luke grunts from behind the counter, clearly reliving a Pop-Tart argument from the past.)

LUKE
It wasn’t just a Pop-Tart. It was every night.

LORELAI (grinning)
And she turned out fine!

RORY (still distracted, quietly)
I hope so.

(Lorelai notices Rory’s hesitation but doesn’t press just yet.)

ACT TWO

(Scene: Town meeting. Taylor is unveiling an elaborate “Stars Hollow Baby Registry” system, which the town must use.)

TAYLOR
Now, expecting parents can fill out these detailed forms, and the town will ensure they receive only Stars Hollow-approved gifts! No generic onesies from Amazon—hand-knitted sweaters by Mrs. Kim’s church group only!

(Cut to Lane in the audience, rolling her eyes.)

LANE
You know my twins are six now, and they still have sweaters from the last registry. They won’t take them off, even in summer.

(Zack nods solemnly. Everyone groans.)

LORELAI (whispering to Rory)
If we don’t escape now, we’re going to be signed up for a “Mom and Baby” lute circle.

RORY (laughs, then falters)
Actually, Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something.

(Cut to Lorelai’s face, picking up on Rory’s serious tone.)

ACT THREE

(Interior: The Dragonfly Inn, Rory and Lorelai sitting outside on the porch. Twilight sets in.)

RORY
Mom, I don’t know if I can do this. Raise a baby alone.

LORELAI (softly)
You’re not alone, kid. You’ve got me, you’ve got Luke, you’ve got the entire town that will probably argue over which onesie to dress your kid in every morning.

RORY
Yeah, but—should I tell Logan?

(Beat. Lorelai takes a deep breath.)

LORELAI
I can’t answer that for you. But I can say that no matter what, you’ll figure it out. Just like I did.

RORY
I just—I never thought I’d be where you were at my age.

LORELAI (smirks)
Oh, so you do admit I was young and cool?

(Rory laughs through her uncertainty, and Lorelai squeezes her hand.)

TAG SCENE

(Back at Luke’s, late night. Rory writes in a journal.)

VOICEOVER (Rory’s writing)
“Life never follows the script you expect. But maybe the best stories are the ones you never saw coming.”

(She closes the journal, looks at her stomach, and smiles.)

(Cut to black. End episode.)

He wasn’t a dumb man. He knew the odds, knew when to fold, knew when to walk away. He just never did. He always thought, one more hand, one more bet, one more drink… and maybe things would turn around.

But luck ain’t a friend—it’s a loan shark. And Danny had run out of extensions.

The last game was bad. Real bad. He was already deep in the hole, owing the wrong people more than he could count. But he’d convinced himself that tonight was different—that this time, the cards would come through.

They didn’t.

The dealer’s hand came down, and Danny felt everything slip away. His last few crumpled bills were snatched off the table, his car keys gone, his watch gone, his wallet emptied. All he had left were the clothes on his back and the bruises on his ribs from the guys who ""escorted"" him out.

He didn’t remember how far he walked that night. He just remembered the cold. The ache in his stomach. The dry, empty feeling of being completely, utterly broke.

And that’s when he saw the sign.

Eddy’s Helping Hand Shelter.

It was a run-down mess of a place, barely standing, patched together with scrap wood and rusted metal, but the lights were on. And more importantly, so was the smell of food.

Danny dragged himself inside, expecting the usual shelter routine—bad coffee, thin blankets, maybe a cot if he was lucky. Instead, he got Eddy.

Big guy. Wide shoulders. Thick arms, calloused hands as big as dinner plates. Wore a grease-stained flannel and jeans that looked like they’d been patched up with whatever fabric was closest. His beard was patchy, his eyes small and unreadable, and when he smiled, it didn’t quite reach them.

""You look like shit,"" Eddy had said with a chuckle, clapping Danny on the back hard enough to knock the wind out of him.

Danny didn’t care. He just nodded.

""You hungry?""

Danny nodded again.

Eddy grinned. ""C’mon. Let’s get you somethin’ to eat.""

The stew was rich, thick, meaty. Best thing Danny had tasted in weeks. Maybe months.

""You runnin’ from somethin’?"" Eddy asked, watching him eat.

Danny swallowed a mouthful and shrugged. ""Somethin’ like that.""

Eddy nodded like he understood. ""Lot of folks end up here that way. I don’t ask questions. Long as you pull your weight, you can stay as long as you need.""

Danny didn’t plan on staying. Hell, he didn’t plan on waking up tomorrow. But when you’ve got nowhere left to go, you take what you can get.

And Eddy? Eddy was real generous.


---

Danny stayed. A night turned into a few weeks. He did odd jobs around the shelter, helped fix things up, even learned how to cook a little.

Eddy was always meticulous in the kitchen. Wiped down the counters twice, cleaned his knives three times, never wasted a single scrap. If something wasn’t up to his standards, it went straight in the garbage.

Danny didn’t ask where the meat came from.

He didn’t want to know.

But then the other guys started disappearing.

It was slow at first—just a few folks moving on, like they always do. But then one of the regulars, Mitch, vanished overnight. No goodbyes, no packed bags, just gone.

Danny asked Eddy about it.

""He didn’t fit in,"" Eddy had said, tossing a bloodstained apron into the laundry bin. ""Some folks just don’t appreciate what they’re given.""

Something about the way he said it crawled under Danny’s skin.

That night, Danny didn’t sleep. And that’s when he heard the noise.


---

It was past midnight when he heard the clank of metal, followed by the hum of a freezer door opening.

Danny crept out of his cot, stepping carefully, keeping his breath shallow. He followed the noise toward the back—the kitchen.

And that’s when he saw it.

The meat locker was open.

Eddy stood inside, humming to himself, shifting something heavy on the stainless-steel table. His massive hands peeled back plastic wrap, revealing a man’s arm. The skin was pale, the fingers frozen stiff.

Danny’s stomach lurched.

Eddy turned. Saw him.

For a second, neither of them moved.

Then Eddy smiled.

""You weren’t s’posed to see that.""


---

Danny ran.

Didn’t think, didn’t breathe, just bolted for the exit. But Eddy was fast. Too fast for a guy that big.

Danny barely made it two steps before something crashed into the back of his skull—a fist like a sledgehammer. The world tilted. He went down hard, tasting blood, vision spinning.

Eddy grabbed him by the collar, dragged him back into the kitchen, his breath hot and reeking of smoked meat.

""You were doin’ so good,"" Eddy sighed, shaking his head. ""I liked you, Danny. You worked hard. Didn’t ask questions."" He flexed his fingers, rolling his shoulders. ""Damn shame.""

Danny fought. Twisted, kicked, managed to break free for half a second—long enough to grab a knife off the counter.

Eddy laughed. Laughed.

""Whatcha gonna do with that, boy?""

Danny didn’t answer. He just swung.

The knife bit deep into Eddy’s arm, cutting through flannel and flesh. Not deep enough. Eddy grunted, grabbed Danny’s wrist, and bent it back until the bones cracked.

Danny screamed.

Eddy shoved him forward, slamming him face-first against the counter.

""This ain't personal,"" Eddy muttered, grabbing a cleaver.

Danny saw his reflection in the metal.

This is it.

This is where I die.

But then—

A crash.

The kitchen door slammed open.

Danny twisted, saw a shadow move. Then another. Footsteps. Voices.

Cops.

For the first time, Eddy looked surprised.

Danny didn’t think—he ran. Barreled past the door, stumbled into the hall, kept going until he hit cold air and pavement.

The officers barely had time to react before he collapsed at their feet, screaming.

By the time they got inside, Eddy was already gone.

The shelter was empty.

But in the freezer?

In the freezer, they found the proof.


---

Danny never gambled again.

They never found Eddy.

Some say he just vanished into the woods, kept moving, set up somewhere new. Maybe a different town, a different shelter. Maybe he’s still feeding folks.

Maybe he’s watching, waiting, looking for the next person who won’t be missed.

And if you ever find yourself in some rundown shelter on the outskirts of town, where the food is just a little too good, where the kitchen is too clean, the knives too sharp…

You better pray you ain’t next on the menu.

1ilcf3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ilcf3v/aio_about_how_a_friend_treats_me_and_our/,AIO about how a friend treats me and our friendship?,"I’m 18, and naturally I’ve shed a good bit of my high school friends. Right now, I’ve got about one “close” friend, but she’s a taker. It feels like I’ve only ever known friendships that exhaust me. I consistently watch her choose not to invest in herself or in our friendship, and I just want someone who actually wants to. It’s like pouring water into a bucket with a leak at this point.

For starters, she seems to lie..a lot..about little things, and sometimes I catch her. One time, she asked me to go see Wicked in theaters together. Over text she swore she had never seen it before and was so excited to hang out since we hadn’t in a while. Life gets in the way, that’s how it goes. But the second we get to the theater, she instantly says, “I saw this with ____, and we loved it.” Not to mention, I always have to work around her schedule, even though she’s unemployed and has been for a long time!😀

And then there’s the money thing. She constantly suggests we do things that cost money. things she knows she doesn’t have the money for. And when she brings up how broke she is, I feel bad and just end up paying for her. And she knows I feel bad because she never offers to pay me back or even acknowledges it. It’s not like I have unlimited money either..but she never forgets when I owe her 7 dollars for a lemonade! I don’t mind helping a friend out, but it’s not even a once in a while thing- it’s a pattern, and I hate that I let myself fall into it. 

Another time, she tried to use our friend for a ride. We wanted to go to a ren fair, and I was the only one with a license. I was borrowing my dad’s work car which is an old, rust bucket from 2006 but I was grateful for the steed nonetheless. She’s still kicking. My dad just asked me to keep the driving fairly local. No problem. I respect that. At the time, I was still in school, so I asked my parents if I could drive me and this friend to the fair.

They said no, it was over an hour away with highways. I get it, but I was bummed. I told my friend, and her immediate response was, “Well time to invite *insert name of friend with car*.” We had talked about inviting two mutual friends before, including one who had a car, but she took it upon herself to text the group chat and ask if they wanted to go. One friend was busy, but the one with the car didn’t respond yet. A week passes and she texts me out of nowhere:

———————————————
———————————————Friend: The ren faire is Saturday.

Me: Man I don’t think we’re gonna make it.

Friend: Bro what do you mean? I bought something for it.

Me: Dude, so did I but we don’t have a ride.

Friend: Well didn’t *friend with car* wanna go?

Me: We haven’t heard from him dude, and I don’t wanna use him as a ride. It’s not right.

Friend: I don’t think we were… but it’s okay. I’ll probably go with my dad.

Me: We didn’t invite him until we realized we didn’t have a ride. What do you mean we weren’t gonna use him?

Friend: How? I invited him and *other friend* because I wanted them to come with us, not because I wanted a ride bruh.

Me: Okay, that’s fine if that’s how you feel that went down, but this is how I feel about it. It just didn’t seem like that when I looked at how we were talking about them while making the plan.

Friend: Yeah.

—————————————————————————————

I don’t understand how she genuinely thinks we weren’t about to use him for his car. Funny thing is, after we graduated, she cried to me for two hours about how toxic he was to her. Nooo, he was your friend though, right? Pisses me off.

She also used me for gas station drink runs. weekly. We planned a set day to hang out every week and grab drinks, but she’d go the whole week without talking to me at all and then suddenly text to ask if we were still going. At first, I tried to brush it off. maybe she’s just not a texter. But this girl was in a long distance relationship.

She constantly calls me her best friend but won’t tell me anything about her life when I ask. It’s hard to elaborate on that because she DOES tell me about her life…but like, she doesn’t want to it just seems to be things where she’s in the wrong?? Or is just being an asshole? I don’t know how else to explain it.. but recently, she moved out of her parents’ house. She claimed it was because her mom wouldn’t take her to get coffee, (which like….what the hell??? Why are you moving out over that…you could get your license maybe idk…) and when I asked for more details, she said she’d tell me in person. But when I followed up? She brushed it off and said, “Ahhh, that was pretty much all.” 

I tell her what I think a lot, it usually starts out with me saying “I wanna be here for you so what do you need from me right now? do you want advice or a listener? What’s up?” cause sometimes you just gotta vent and I get that. She knows I ask though, and I think that’s why she didn’t wanna talk about it or tell me more? I’m not sure though, i don’t wanna assume that. She did end up moving into her grandma’s house though and when the grandmas WiFi wasn’t working, she texted me at midnight asking if my dad (who’s an electrician) could come fix it or install a new router for free because the installation was too expensive. She was saying she didn’t have anything to do because she doesn’t work and her grandma dies her own thing. 

She ALSO lies especially about chronic illnesses! I know for a fact that she has a few legitimate ones, but she keeps bringing up new ones and then forgetting she even said she had them.

Just yesterday, she posted something about her heart rate being high when she wakes up. I slid up and asked if she had POTS (meaning to say, “Is it your POTS?”). She replies “I don’t know man, I think I genuinely might have it.”

Except I know she’s told me she has POTS before. When we first met in school, she had to sit down because of it. I checked on her, sat with her, made sure she was okay. She mentioned it again a little after that initial meeting… but then it just kind of was never brought up again? Which is out of the ordinary for her because everyday conversation is just always about things in her life with her, and not only that but she usually would tell me about developments in her illnesses. I want to clarify that I’m completely ignorant about the true effects of POTS, so please forgive me. But to me, it just seems off, no?

One of the most exhausting and frustrating parts is that she doesn’t talk to me, she talks at me. She never asks about me, never inquires about my life. Every conversation gets flipped back to her somehow. I just stopped trying to talk about anything. I end up just asking her about her life instead because she won’t let me talk. It’s like I’m not even there except to be an audience for her.

And the absolute cherry on top of this sundae is I’ve got a friend that actually met me through this girl..and she has to insert herself into our friendship. I don’t get it. We can all be friends separately and not everything has to be a group activity. But every time I try to do something with my new friend, she finds a way to wedge herself in. It’s like she doesn’t want me to have anything outside of her.

I let this get to me a lot because I know I can’t confront her, I think she’ll just get mad. I know she misses her girlfriend a lot and she’s said that I’m one of her only friends..but it just doesn’t feel like friendship. I find myself being hateful about it and I’ve stepped away and reflected on myself for a while because of that, but since then she’s asked to meet up with me and do something. I know she’s not to blame for how I feel about it because I’ve let myself be put in these situations, and I can’t control how she lives or what she does…but man, I care a lot about her as a friend. Advice? I got you. A place to get away? No worries. It just feels like a transaction where she’s constantly rewarded.

I wanna know other views and to make sure I’m not being an asshole about anything. I’ve had my share of friends who just make you feel bad for anything and everything..that’s the last thing I wanna do to anyone.

Am I overreacting? Is this something I should talk to her about and try to fix? Or is it just not worth it anymore? If you don’t think she’ll listen and it’s not worth my energy, or if you think I’m insane maybe LOL…just anything, please let me know because I don’t even know how to feel about this anymore. I just want it to stop weighing on my heart.",0,1739099068.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False

Bengaluru can be a lonely city. It’s full of people, but real connections? Hard to find. That’s why I want to build something small and simple—no grand billion-dollar plans, just genuine, fun experiences where people can meet, eat, and enjoy themselves.

The idea? Fun dinner parties and restaurant-themed challenges.

Imagine this: You’re at Café Noir, taking on the French Feast Challenge. Participants must complete a four-course meal inspired by four French cities within a set time (say, 30-45 minutes).

 **Starter:** A dish from Paris (e.g., French Onion Soup)  
 **Main Course:** A dish from Lyon (e.g., Coq au Vin)  
 **Dessert:** A dish from Nice (e.g., Tarte Tropézienne)  
 **Drink:** A classic café beverage (e.g., Café Noir’s signature coffee or a French soda)

**The Twist?** The fastest finisher wins the **“Café Noir Champion”** card, getting free coffee for a month and a feature on Café Noir’s social media.

And that’s just one of many experiences. Whether it’s themed dinners, quirky challenges, or just a space for people to meet over good food, the goal is simple: **help people connect, without the awkwardness of dating apps or networking events.**

I just want to have fun doing this and create something people actually enjoy. No pressure, no corporate nonsense—just great food, great company, and memorable nights.

1ilc2k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ilc2k7/we_built_a_web_product_in_48_hours_and_our_goal/,We Built a Web Product in 48 Hours and Our Goal Is Just $1,"# The Backstory

Ever had one of those moments where you wake up and think, *“What if I built something completely random just for fun?”* That’s exactly what happened to me (and my friend, Sam) this past weekend. We wanted to create a **web product**from scratch in **under 48 hours**. But here’s the twist: **our only goal is to make exactly $1**. Not $10, not $1,000, definitely not $1,000,000 just $1, a single buck.

# Why Only $1?

* **Low Pressure, High Fun**: When there’s not a massive financial target, the stress levels stay low. We can focus on being creative and silly.
* **Quick Validation**: Earning even a tiny amount proves that someone, somewhere, values what we made. And if they’ll pay one dollar, maybe we’re onto something that can evolve later.
* **Pure Experimentation**: It’s a mini-lab for testing ideas, building fast, and learning from mistakes—without the usual startup hype.

# The 48-Hour Challenge

# A Strict Timeframe

We gave ourselves exactly 48 hours to go from “random idea” to “live product” on the web. That meant:

* **No endless brainstorming**. We had to pick an idea fast.
* **No over-engineering**. Only the simplest version (MVP) would get done in time.
* **No second-guessing**. If we messed up, we pivoted quickly or embraced the chaos.

# The Actual Product

We ended up creating a small platform called **StakeGod** essentially a fun way for people to set personal challenges or bets, hold themselves accountable, and have a little “skin in the game.” The entire premise is that you pick a challenge for yourself (or for a friend), stake something on it, and share progress publicly so others can follow along.

But remember, our bigger mission: **Make $1**. That’s it. If even one person out there pays for something on this site, we’re doing a happy dance and calling it a success.

# How We Pulled It Off

1. **Rapid-Fire Brainstorm**: We spent the first couple of hours swapping ideas over coffee. We wanted something we’d personally use something that’s not serious but can still be helpful.
2. **MVP Mindset**: We asked ourselves, *“What is the absolute minimum we need for this idea to work?”* We cut out everything else. This kept the scope tiny.
3. **Divide & Conquer**: Sam handled the quick design layout (we went with a super simple style), while I tackled the basic functionality. We used lightweight tools and open-source resources whenever possible.
4. **Launch & Share**: With almost no time left, we deployed a functioning version. Then we told a few friends, posted on social media, and started holding our breath.

# Lessons Learned Along the Way

* **Speed Sparks Creativity**: Knowing we only had 48 hours lit a fire under us to solve problems quickly. You can’t fall into “analysis paralysis” if the clock is ticking.
* **Tiny Goals Are Still Goals**: Why chase $1M right away if $1 can prove your idea has legs? Every big success starts with the smallest possible step.
* **Embracing Imperfection**: Our product is *far* from perfect. But getting something out there beats waiting forever for the “perfect moment.”
* **Fun is Fuel**: We realized we hadn’t laughed this much while coding in ages. Doing something just for the thrill of it feels pretty refreshing.

# A Historical Nod

This approach reminds me of the early days of **Apple** or **Microsoft**, where Steve Jobs or Bill Gates weren’t trying to raise billions immediately. They started in garages, building “small.” Their initial profits (if any) were modest, but the excitement of *making something real* fueled them to keep going.

# Why This Might Interest You

If you’re reading this on **Entrepreneur** or **Startup**, you’ve probably seen countless posts about raising VC money, developing complicated SaaS, or scaling to seven figures. That’s all cool, but sometimes, **it’s fun to go the opposite route**: set a playful, almost absurd goal, and see what you can do in a short time frame.

* **You don’t need big budgets** to launch.
* **You don’t need endless months** of planning.
* **You don’t need everything** to be perfect before showing people.

Maybe this could inspire you to start your own wacky micro-project: 72 hours to build a digital zine, 24 hours to design a new board game, 1 week to create a simple mobile app. The timescale and the smallness of the goal can kickstart your creativity more than you’d expect.

# The Path Forward

Are we going to stop once we hit $1? Probably not. If it happens and we see any excitement around the product, we might add new features or refine what’s there. But if no one cares or if we only get 50 cents it’ll still be worth it for the experience, the laughs, and the story.

One big takeaway: **even if an idea is half-baked, launching it can teach you more than just thinking about it**. Worst case scenario, you spent two days on a fun project. Best case scenario, you find something people truly love and create a stepping stone for bigger things.

# How You Can Follow or Help

* **Check It Out**: If you’re curious, see how it all turned out at stakegod. Maybe you’ll be the first to throw in a dollar and help us meet our silly goal.
* **Ask Us Anything**: Drop a comment below if you want details on the build, design choices, or lessons learned. We’re an open book.
* **Start Your Own Timer**: If you’re feeling inspired, consider giving yourself 48 hours to make something no matter how trivial and see where it leads. Then share your story here on Reddit too.

# TL DR

* We built a web product, **StakeGod**, in **48 hours**.
* Our only goal: **earn $1**.
* Why? Because it’s fun, forces quick creativity, and proves small wins can be incredibly motivating.

**Thanks for reading**, this was a blast to make. We hope it gives you a smile, maybe an idea for your own mini-project, or at least a moment to think, “Hey, sometimes small goals rock.” Feel free to share your thoughts, feedback, or your own quick-launch success (or failure) stories!

# Final Thoughts

Building something fast and aiming low might sound counterintuitive in a world of venture-backed unicorn dreams, but it’s surprisingly liberating. We encourage anyone who’s been stuck in brainstorming mode to **pick a tiny target** and **just go for it**. You might be surprised by what you learn about building, marketing, and yourself.

Thanks again for stopping by, and best of luck on all your 48-hour (or longer!) ventures!",5,1739097604.0,Entrepreneur,2,0.78,False

I was looking at buying a Bean to Cup coffee machine, will these still produce the flavours from good quality beans. 
I have been using ground coffee from Rave, would I need to store beans in an Airscape container? 
Once I've purchased some beans online do I need to let them rest for a period time before using? 
I'm new to this & only just started enjoying flavoured fresh coffee via a Cafitere recently so want to know is a Bean to Cup worth the investment. ",2,1739097429.0,AskUK,50,1.0,False

First, sorry for the mess, I just moved into this room.

I'm looking for some advice on how to arrange this room. At the moment it feels just like a lot of things put around with no cohesion. I was also thinking on getting an armchair for reading or when people come around, and a coffee table, but I have no idea where to put them.

The placement of the bar is fixed (I need it to be close to the window for the air fryer), but anything else can be moved. I would also want to somehow section the room, have like a ""living"" area, maybe use some furniture to do that, but then I am afraid it might make the space crammed.

Feel free to throw in your suggestions. Thanks in advice!

pot has 16 drainage holes… i never repotted it from the nursery soil, could that be it!? i always thought it was too baby and frail to be repotted yet.
