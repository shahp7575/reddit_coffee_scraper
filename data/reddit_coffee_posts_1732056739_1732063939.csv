1. Generating a coupon code through your POS system to be included in the coupon book;

2. Manually entering a discount from a coupon presented by the customer. The coupon is not in your system, but you’d have a way to confirm its authenticity and validity.

I’m also curious if there are any specific challenges or limitations that would make the second approach impractical for your business?",1,1732063769.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

God it sucked. Dumped me out of nowhere a few days before my birthday, which he had been planning a party for and texting my friends to invite them. Out of nowhere texted me at work to say he was coming to pick me up because we had to talk. I’m a piano teacher and it was my first day working that shift with new students so I just had to figure it out for the next few hours til he came to get me. He drove me home and he had a bon iver album playing lmao, what a prick.  It was completely awful and I will never forgive that asshole but it does get a lot better. 

On a funnier note, earlier in the night I was super anxious about teaching my new students so I decided to get a coffee and a sausage biscuit from the Chinese cafe Nextdoor to where I was working. When I tell you I had to shit so fucking badly when he picked me up. I was crying my eyes out when he dropped me off at my apartment I said “I need to go upstairs for a second.” Because I literally had to assault my toilet. Then I went back downstairs so he could continue dumping me lol. And while he was telling me the reasons why we were breaking up one of which included is that “I’m funnier than him” and it made him uncomfortable when I hung out with him and his friends lmao what a loser. 

Anyway just wanted to share!! I’m with an amazing partner now and that dingus a blip on my timeline ",1,1732063732.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Friends look up to you and seek your advice. You're supposed to dress and act a certain way—prude, innocent, pious, and pure.

But deep down, there's a wild side of you that's been repressed—collared, chained, and caged by the expectations and norms you were raised with. This inner conflict drives you crazy because of the hypocrisy you see.

You can't let this side of you out due to a fear of judgment or vulnerability.

You have a choice: stay in your current role, which is fine, or unleash yourself.

I'm here to help you explore those urges discreetly and without judgment. This might be your chance to let loose and be as daring as you want. When we’re done, you can return to your normal life with a secret grin that no one needs to understand—until you want to do it again.

1gvcuvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gvcuvw/do_i_wish_my_nmum_a_happy_birthday_ncestranged/,Do I wish my nmum a happy birthday? (NC/estranged),"It’s been a while since I’ve felt the need to post in this community. 

I know this isn’t a decision anybody can make on my behalf, but I have often turned to this community to hear your thoughts and bounce ideas as nobody in my life can truly relate to being raised by a narcissistic parent or to being an estranged adult child.

Following on from my post two years ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/YW6LcPqWnU) 

My mother and I have been NC *almost* the entire time (just over 2 years). Following the events mentioned in that post, my mother discarded me and no longer responded to any of my communication attempts. On Christmas 2022 my partner at the time and I came to her house to drop off a gift and wish her a merry Christmas as a means to make amends and she slammed the door in my face, on Christmas Day.

I continued to reach out, on Mother’s Day for example, and was met with radio silence.

I then decided to go travelling and prior to going abroad for 6 months (around one year ago now) I convinced my mum to meet with me for a coffee where I tried to give her an update on my life - my ex-partner and I of 8 years had broken up, I met my current partner, and I wanted to tell her in person that I was going abroad for some time. Nothing substantial was touched on during the meeting but I left the door open and said that I am willing to try to re-build our relationship. I intended on this being my last attempt, and to leave the ball in her court going forward.

I haven’t heard from her since.

My mother is punishing me with the silent treatment for putting my own needs above hers. 

My sister, who lives abroad, is still in touch with her. My sister also has narcissistic tendencies and unfortunately has taken the brunt of my mum’s deceitful stories about me. I don’t trust her but we do speak on occasion. I have a new partner now, and although we are long distance, my sister met him this summer along with my dad (parents are divorced) as she was visiting at the same time that he was. I organised for my partner to meet my dad as we are planning on getting married next year. During this meeting, my sister tried to convince me to reach out to my mum again, telling me that she feels upset I didn’t reach out once I came home from my travels. Bearing in mind, there was a whole other Christmas and my birthday during that time, where I heard nothing from my mother. I was firm in that I have done my fair share of reaching out and extending olive branches, and I feel that after how I have been shut out multiple times, it should be up to my mum to express that she would like to have some kind of a relationship.

It’s my mum’s birthday tomorrow. In my heart I know that I should remain NC as my life has had nothing but abundance flowing in since she stopped being in my life. I left a relationship which mirrored a lot of unhealthy patterns from my childhood, and entered an incredibly fulfilling, empowering relationship since. I have finally felt the freedom, validation, and empowerment to understand myself, develop a sense of identity, and interact with the world as my true self without having to put my mother’s needs ahead of my own. The concept of even *having* needs has been a journey to get a grasp of over these last couple of years, but I do feel I have made some serious headway!

And yet I feel like the societal pressure of continuing to reach out is looming over me. I am sick to death of extended family members telling me that I should reach out (as I if I haven’t tried). I am made to feel as if I am cold and heartless. Frankly, I find this incredibly invalidating and triggering. I have been discarded and shut out, I have tried to reach out more than enough times, and yet I am still made to feel guilty for not having my mother in my life. I envy those who cannot grasp the last resort nature of going NC with a parent. Going NC wasn’t even my choice, though being shut out was a massive blessing in disguise. I never knew life could feel this free and that I could be this happy.

I also feel a sense of moral aptitude by reaching out and “doing the right thing”. But I know in my heart that if I reach out, and receive a response, I cannot currently envision a way in which our relationship would work, as I have accepted the fact that my mum’s pattern of behaviour is extremely unlikely to change, and I do not have capacity in my life to put up with abuse, belittlement, and punishment for putting my needs first. 

And yet there is a little girl in me who wants to share my happiness with her mum, who wants to tell her about the fulfilment I have been so lucky to find, and to share this all with her, without the fear of her making my life miserable.

I am also planning on emigrating once I am married. This is a whole other can of worms which I am unpicking in therapy but I know that if I do not reach out before moving, this will be unforgivable in my mother’s eyes who has a deep-rooted fear of abandonment and need for control over me.

Please, if you have any thoughts, share them. How do you deal with the guilt of putting yourself first? How do you, for the thousandth time, explain to people that you just do not have it in you to experience abuse anymore? How do you deal with being made to look like a cold, heartless bitch when you are just protecting yourself? 

I know some of you can relate. I am sending you all so much strength and love and just know that you are not alone in this exhausting battle. 

PS. My cat is living his best life with me, and has brought me more joy in life than I can even begin to explain 🤍",1,1732063229.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

***Tuesday***

In the hours since they’d shared dinner together, Sararah paced the flat roof of her apartment building, thinking about everything she and her roommate’s work partner had discussed outside his apartment building. Specifically, the pros and cons of going forward with his suggestion. She hadn’t been joking when she said how important Pepper was to her, and knowing her best friend in the whole wide world worked for Daniel Nascerdios (one of the few real antichrists living on the world) was tantamount to having fifty nuclear weapons aimed at her pretty little redhead.

In fact, every evening since she’d found out Daniel Nascerdios was Pepper’s boss, she’d asked the MCS detective the same thing to test the ground between them, and tonight had been no exception. “You know I’m a sex demon, right?”

If the veil had been used during the day, Pepper would’ve read the statement as a humanised sex addict rather than the complete truth.

“In every sense of the word, you shameless demon,” her roommate replied on her way through the apartment to their shared bathroom. The statement was always followed by, “What’s for dinner?”

“What do you feel like?” Sararah had volleyed at the time.

Having spent decades living amongst humans, Sararah had developed a taste for various human foods but hadn’t mastered the mortal means of preparing them. Fortunately, she hadn’t needed to, as she utilised her shifting to recreate all manner of meals by absorbing mass into herself, then expunging it in the necessary form before separating herself from it.

The first (and only) time Pepper had witnessed it, she’d bolted to the bathroom and emptied the contents of her stomach, vowing (after rinsing her mouth out between shuddered breaths and brushing her teeth almost as many times afterwards) that if Pepper saw that again, she would take out her gun and personally shoot her.

It wasn’t a credible threat since Sararah had always taken precautions to protect herself amongst these wilful mortals but nevertheless agreed. From that moment on, made a point of waiting until Pepper was in the shower before throwing dinner together for them.

Mass had always been easy to come by in a world that had a very limited understanding of turning one thing into another. Only scientists understood how atoms could be separated to recreate something else, with very few at the top of their game having the equipment to do so. They had yet to learn about complex shifting but were slowly getting there.

“Asian,” came the muffled reply through the closed bathroom door, along with the sound of the shower being turned on.

“Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Mongolian?” Sararah had learned long ago not to rattle off more than a handful of choices, despite hundreds of other Asian-style foods being available. She herself favoured the Chukchi style, but after informing her roommate that she was eating reindeer … Pepper had barfed right there at the table and then went on a Christmas rant that lasted over a week.

Apparently, all reindeers had the potential to be directly related to Santa’s magical eight, and Pepper was never chewing on Blitzen’s brother’s leg ever again. Ever since that night, whenever there was meat on the plate (and Sararah was a demon, so meat played a major component in her diet), her friend sought out verbal confirmation that it wasn’t *reindeer.* Any other type of venison was fine. *Reindeer* was sacred.

It was a nutty thing for a homicide detective to get caught up on, and that was just one of the countless reasons Sararah loved her to bits.

“Chinese!”

Of course, that was when Pepper’s partner, Detective Sexy Beast called. She’d heard the urgency in his voice, and after glancing at the closed bathroom door, she’d taken the punt and gone to meet him.

The conversation they’d shared in his car still scared the crap out of her, but by the skin of her fangs, she’d crafted a smorgasbord of Chinese options spread out on the coffee table (that she and Pepper used in lieu of the dining table they didn’t own) before Pepper came out of the shower to join her.   

Bailey, Pepper’s six-year-old American Bobtail, was doing a series of laps around the table and figure eights around Sararah’s legs, hoping for a pre-dinner treat. He’d learned very early on not to steal a demon’s food, though fortunately, Pepper hadn’t been around for that particular altercation either, and by the time she’d come home from her first day on the job, Bailey was … *basically* … in the same condition he’d been before she’d left. Pepper had crowed ever since about how well-behaved her precious cat had become, and Sararah had no intention of explaining why.

Partway through dinner, Pepper had put her chopsticks down and stared across the table at her. “What’s wrong?” she’d asked.

Detective Sexy Beast’s words replayed in her mind. *‘I don’t envy you your choice, but it’s in your court now. I’ll support whatever you decide.’*

Sararah couldn’t remember how she’d answered that, but she knew she’d thrown out some platitude and beat a hasty retreat very quickly after that, realm-stepping to the roof where the balmy summer night allowed her to clear her head.

Now, hours later, she found herself no closer to a solution and nearly jumped out of her skin when a familiar voice said, “That’s it. I’m done with this. Talk to me, Sarah. You’ve been pacing the roof non-stop since I came up here looking for you, and you didn’t even notice I was here.”

Sararah whirled and found Pepper standing in the open doorway that led down into the building. Her hair was sleep-mussed, and she wore a light yellow terry robe she’d bought a month ago, cinched tightly at the waist. It and the fuzzy slippers on her feet were too warm to be worn at this time of year, yet Pepper insisted she was cold enough to warrant it, especially at night. Her arms were folded in a veiled attempt to fend off the non-existent chill.

*Winter here is going to kill you, girl.*

The fact that Sararah hadn’t noticed the temperature shift as she’d paced in front of that open door was a testament to how distracted she was. “It’s—I—but—what are you doing up here?” she finally settled on.

“We’ve been roommates for months, and being observant is kinda my jam. We both knew you didn’t suddenly have a date to go to, and this is where you withdraw to, to do your thinking. So do us both a favour and spare me the ‘nothing’s wrong’ speech and the disappearing act, or our next conversation is going to be a whole lot more unpleasant.”

“But it’s three in the morning, and you have to be at work in a few hours.”

Her arms tensed and tightened angrily. “All the more reason for you to get to the point.”

Sararah opened her mouth several times, but the words simply wouldn’t come out.

Pepper’s eyes rounded in fear, and before Sararah could stop her, she dropped her arms to her sides and stepped forward, allowing the door to shut behind her. “Are you moving out?” She swallowed hard. “Is that what’s going on? Are you leaving?”

Sararah’s attention was drawn away from Pepper having effectively locked them out on the roof, and back to her worried roommate. “What? No!” Nevertheless, she backed away when Pepper went to touch her arm. “Don’t.”

“Then talk to me, Sarah. What’s going on? You’ve been jumpier than a professional Double Dutch skipper ever since I got in.”

“Did you know—” Sararah’s sentence evaporated when she realised nothing good would come of it, and she wouldn’t betray Sexy Beast’s confidence like that. Instead, she swung away from Pepper and stared out over the street below. “I’m not a Nascerdios.”

She felt rather than saw Pepper move up beside her. “I know.”

The sincerity in Pepper’s voice (as opposed to something witty) meant she knew things were serious. “I don’t get any of the perks of being a Nascerdios, and if my bosses find out they know I’m here, I’ll be sent back to Hell faster than anyone can blink.”

Pepper turned to rest her backside against the parapet wall to look at her side-on through her one good eye. “I figured it was something like that. Did my boss say something to you today?”

Sararah shook her head. “No. I don’t think he’s told anyone that he knows. No one’s come to get me, anyway.”

“So, what’s the problem?”

“You’ve worked for him for months. Has anyone ever spoken to you about something called ‘the veil’?”

“The boss hasn’t said a word to me about the divine, so I honestly don’t think he knows I know.”

“That’s my thought, too.”

Pepper pressed her lips together into a tight line. “Are you sure we should be discussing this out in the open? Maybe we should go back to the apartment where there’s walls and less chance of prying eyes.”

Sararah accepted the mortal logic of her friend’s viewpoint despite knowing if they were going to be overheard, it would’ve already happened, and she’d already be gone.

Pepper pushed off the parapet only to skid to an abrupt halt. “Oh, crap!”

*The door.*

“Pep, if you close your eye and keep it closed, I’ll get us back to our apartment in a few seconds. Do you trust me?”

Pepper’s only eye narrowed suspiciously, then closed altogether. “Suspicious to the end, girl,” Sararah chuckled, dropping her hand on her roommate’s shoulder. “Threetwoonerun!” She rammed the words together and, at the end, surged forward, shoving a shocked Pepper into the celestial realm and back into their apartment in two running steps that ended with Pepper crashing headfirst into the sofa.

Pepper’s eye shot open, and she looked around. “Wait—” she said, her mouth opening wider with every added moment. “Oh, holy shit! You never told me you could teleport!”

There was a lot about the divine Sararah hadn’t told her friend, believing ignorance was her one chance of staying safe. Her shrug was part guilt, part reflex.

Pepper’s gaze then narrowed, and her left hand uncurled to point at the empty seat at the other end of the couch. “Siddown,” she growled, no doubt drawing on years of intimidation that served her well in an interrogation room.

Despite the seriousness of the situation, Sararah tried not to smile … or even smirk. She was a demon, for Hell’s sake, and had spent centuries surviving the evils of Chaos with nothing but her wits and sexual prowess. For a mortal to think they could intimidate a creature like her with only her tone of voice was utterly hysterical.

She slid into the vacant seat with a sultry sashay, lightly dragging the back of one hand’s nails across her jawline to underscore the smooth perfection of her skin.

Pepper’s squint said wasn’t impressed. “Start with the veil.”

As Sararah had predicted, it was Pepper who’d been first to break, admitting Lucas had been the one to inform her about his protective shield and how it had scared the crap out of her to have something as simple as a phrase hold so much power over her. She hadn’t liked the idea of her memory being reset any more than Sararah did, and as the conversation progressed, Sararah was quickly deciding which way she wanted to go.

for a single beat, heart to heart pulsing beneath

our coats and several layers of flannel

like we were the only two men in the universe.

Then it was over, and I stared up at burlap

sacks of beans stacked on the counter,

Hello everyone who reads this! My life has become much more interesting recently, and for the first time in a long while I feel like I have something substantial to say.
I’m having a bit of a problem I would like your advice on, internet stranger, if you can spare the minute. Life can be so confusing to navigate, and we are meant to help each other, aren’t we?


Anyway, I am 24m. My childhood was largely unremarkable, though it isn’t as nostalgic as I feel like it is for many people. I was an average kid, but a bit overweight, and later on when I hit puberty I got a mean case of acne. Sucks, doesn’t it? It didn’t even really go away until I got on Accutane, and I had to do a chemical peel as well to get rid of the marks. By that point it'd been years of fussing over my face… I was never bullied for it, or anything, funnily enough. I probably deserved it, if we’re being honest. I was just frustrated how some of my peers had completely clear skin all throughout their teens, seems almost too good to be true. 
I for my part had to work for looking good. And that’s not a brag- Not a brag at all! I think most people (apart from a few very unfortunate ones) can become genuinely hot if they put in the effort. Though sadly I could only really go down that path after I got a job that earns me decent money. Around the age of twenty I moved out from my parent’s house, and something about the fresh new theater really kickstarted a change in me. It was like, this is the perfect opportunity to become the man you want to be, it’s now or never. So I started going to the gym, dieting, all that jazz. And it’d be a lie to say it worked immediately. I never went to college but I’ve read a psych journal or two, and in cases like this you really have to fight your brain on every step of the way. You have to learn that those primal impulses are not the authority in your body, it is you. So I started putting down rules for myself. I fixed my diet and got rid of social media. I started showering twice a day, got a nice new skincare routine, and stopped being too lazy to shave. I started writing schedules for myself, as well, both for workdays and weekends. 
All the hours I suddenly had! I could spend those reading ACTUAL books, I learned to appreciate the classics, picking up some sports and making sporty friends, going out to events in my city. My sleep schedule was fixed from one week to the next, and I didn’t even miss my old life at that point.
Of course I’m not the first one to point this out, but I believe humans cannot exist without routine and structure. I started to miss the years that I spent in a fog, not knowing what to do different to start enjoying life. During the holidays, all alone in the house with a full fridge and a Playstation, the days became a swamp. I was just mindlessly indulging any impulse, kind of miserable but unaware of it, not accomplishing a single thing that I enjoy looking back on, or that brought me any benefit.
And if you think about it, everything works like this. We’re to have community, purpose, work towards those milestones in your life. Sometimes you just have to be mature enough to govern yourself. The idea of the Leviathan can be extended to the self in that way. You need control over yourself to control outside circumstances. Anything else leads to anarchy, indulgence of the animal. 

So I had turned my life around.

And that’s when I met her.

She was pretty as hell, my god. Talented with makeup but you could also appreciate her natural looks. Some people are just blessed genetically and they have no idea what treasure has been laid in their hands.

She moved into my apartment building and we started running into each other in the mornings, exchanging some words, and at some point she asked if I had any socials. Which, at that point I’d deleted them. Thought that’d make her lose interest (After all, why talk to a human being that doesn’t have Insta?) but she didn’t even seem too disappointed. Asked for my number instead, which she then got.
And like… I know I’m apparently a dirtbag for saying it, or whatever, but if I’d looked the way I did at 18 or so, no woman would’ve never even said a word to me. It’s just the way it is- People are superficial in nature.  
I could’ve been bitter about that, but instead I saw it as some sort of milestone. My skin really had cleared up and my body was looking pretty nice, losing some fat made me realize that I do, in fact, have a jawline as well- And for the first time in forever a decent looking girl had showed interest in me.

Good times were ahead.

Well after getting my number, she started talking to me. I was riding so high that I didn’t even worry much about it. I replied when I wanted to, told her what I was thinking, no games and no BS. It felt effortless and fun, she made it really fun. After a while she started to write everyday, double-texting, doing anything to get my attention. And I thought to myself: Damn, so this is what being chased feels like. Felt really fuckin good. Of course she wanted me to reply more and I did, which soon devolved into good-morning messages, asking how I am, what’s on my mind, the most boring and basic stuff imaginable. But I actually had something to say then, you know? Back as a teen I would’ve not even known what to say, my brain too fried from 8-hour gaming sessions to form a decently interesting thought. But now I could articulate myself much more clearly, I actually had engaging things to say. I told her about the books I was reading, my interpretations of them, the new workouts I was trying and what I saw on my morning jog. She loved it. Started sending me pictures of herself as well, out and about with her friends, at concerts, stuff like that. This isn’t a brag, but she literally told me that I inspired her to be more active and spend her day more productively. One night I talked her into deleting her social media as well, and I’m glad I could make a small difference like that. We also agreed to stop texting and talk in person going forward, it is just better on every front.

People are not meant for this. Stuffy rooms, empty screens, food that’s slowly killing you. People are meant to strive for greatness.

Looking at our interactions, we were already basically dating. No doubts about it. But you know, the only correct thing in such a situation is to make it official. I started learning her routine, waking up earlier to walk her to the bus stop consistently, and one day when I picked her up by the front door I asked her out. And she said yes.

I was ecstatic.

I sat down that day on my couch and took an hour out of my schedule to just reflect. There was so much I’d achieved. Gotten fit and healthy, gotten a pretty girlfriend, gotten my whole LIFE together. At 23. I really thought I was set, I thought I would just have to keep going like this and everything would fall into place. I was dreaming of marriage, kids, a home of my own and a long, happy, healthy retirement. The things everybody wants.
So, of course, that was a bit preemptive of me. I can see how. And even at the time I was halfway aware of that so I vowed to take it slow and not screw it up. But my girlfriend apparently wanted something different.

When she got back from her job that day she was all over me. She’d already told her friends about me- Still the same day I asked her out!- and she talked me into taking a few pictures together. Took her out on a date, just a small dinner at a local place, as that felt like the right thing to do at the time, and she was positively giddy. At the end of the evening I got around to asking her why, and she confessed to being overjoyed that I felt the same way she did. She told me she was so happy to be official, and exclusive with me. She said that we really had an emotional connection and that she finds me interesting, engaging, and comforting. She was subtly asking to come up to my apartment after but I told her I had a headache and she dropped the topic.
I felt conflicted about what she said, to be honest. At the time I was a bit iffy on if she even meant it, and now I’m sure she didn’t. 
She made it seem like she was in love with JUST my personality. My conversations and opinions and how I was kind to her. But let’s not kid ourselves, it’s because I was looking the way I did. Nothing wrong with that, I was also attracted to her because of her looks, in addition to her personality.

It just felt disingenuous. As if it’s not a whole lot of work that goes into it. As if any downright ugly man just has to be beautiful on the inside, and then he can get lucky.

I’m not sure if women say that because they genuinely believe it, or if they just don’t want to feel shallow. It’s okay to acknowledge basic biological facts. I don’t get why it’s such a taboo, especially since most people are completely and utterly shallow, without shame. Going after what appeals to them and dropping it when they get something better.

Months passed and I experienced the honeymoon phase, watched it ebb away as well. We grew very familiar, which is nice in its own way. Not to say it got boring, but it was different- I felt her putting in less effort to connect with me, conversation topics becoming more surface-level, to a point where we just having small talks that I could’ve had with anyone. Put together like this it sounds bad, it just really wasn’t. Upholding the whole effort and romance was incredibly tiring, to a point where I started struggling with normal chores and lacked energy for my hobbies. About four months ago I had to switch jobs, that cost me a few sleepless nights, and our communications became less frequent. We called instead of meeting, and finally went back to texting. 
One day I googled her name out of interest, and she’d put her social media back up. 
When I got home from work in the evenings I felt drained and agitated, not in a mood to talk, so I just scrolled through her feed and watched her go out with her friends.

But, to her credit, the good-morning messages never stopped. I was the first thing on her mind, every single day.

I started pulling all-nighters for my job. I forgot to eat some days, and on the weekends I slept for half the day instead of dragging myself to the gym. I was in a hole. I started missing that ideal state that I’d gotten a taste of before.
And then I got sick.

It’s no surprise at all, with how I’d been neglecting my body, but man did it suck. 

Probably the first time I really fell ill after leaving home. I didn’t have a thermometer to check my fever, but it got so bad that the insides of my eyelids were in pain from the heat, and I would randomly get so cold that I was curled up in my bed in thick winter coats. I was barely able to breathe, my throat in so much pain that I had no voice, I couldn’t eat or drink but I just kept throwing up.
I really thought I was dying.
I thought what I was feeling was my body shutting down. No more need to eat or sleep, just red hot suffering until I forgot my own name.
I wish I’d called an ambulance, I really do. It just was not a thing we did in my family, my mother would always insist on home remedies and bed rest. Just a flu after all, that’s what I told myself, I’m overreacting and I have to power through this. 
After day two or so I wasn’t thinking clearly anymore, I think I spent most my hours half-asleep, fever dreaming. I was texting my family, my girlfriend, I told them how much I love them and how much this hurts and please, someone help me. At some point I was texting every thought I had to every person I know, hoping for anyone to respond. Anyone. Anything to take my mind off this.

No one ever responded. It was as if I just didn’t exist anymore. They’d all forgotten about me. 
The last few days of the disease, I have no memory of. None. Must’ve been at least 48 hours that I completely lost, maybe more. I woke up in a wet, cold bed, feeling like a corpse.

But I was fine.

I got through it in the end, and then it all felt like a bad dream. Thank god. I slowly got up that day and drank water until I physically couldn’t anymore. I couldn’t eat just yet but it didn’t seem like an impossibility anymore.
Then I checked my phone, livid, suddenly. I had been suffering day and night and not a single get-well wish, a shred of empathy, a simple acknowledgement.
I opened my messages.
No texts sent by me. Not a single one. All my chats had been deserted for the past weeks, ever since I got that new job.
Now, I did not hallucinate these messages. Most of them were written way before I was truly out of it. No, they must have been deleted.
My friends and family deleted my messages. My girlfriend deleted my messages instead of talking to me.

I turned off my phone and left it in my nightstand. 

It was a Saturday then, and I spent most of it recovering. My body felt weaker than it ever had. You know, that’s a punch to the gut. I’d just gotten used to feeling really healthy, and confident in my own skin, and it just made it seem like I was in a much worse state than I probably was. My home was a mess as well, and that made me unreasonably sad. I’d put so much pride in keeping it clean and now it looked like someone had ransacked the place. Everything strewn about, lovelessly, the stench of illness in the air, papers covering the floor like leaves in fall. I spent my best efforts cleaning it all but I could only make a dent. I couldn’t stand to look at the mess, I gave up and left it be. So, that evening, I remembered that I actually had not looked at myself in the mirror in weeks and weeks. I was bracing myself, cuz, yeah I probably looked like shit after such an ordeal.

When I stepped in front of my bathroom mirror, I looked fine. I looked more than fine, I looked hot! Like actually! Like I had at the peak of my fitness, maybe even more so. Probably spent an hour in front of the mirror checking myself but I couldn’t find a single flaw or mark on my face or body. Which, that’s something I’d never had before. Usually there’s something, a cowlick, a zit, eye bags or an allergy rash somewhere. 
Absolutely nothing. 
I’d spent one and a half weeks dying in bed and I came out looking like a supermodel.

What the fuck. I still don’t understand it to this day.

I kept checking myself in the mirror every few minutes after that. But I was not mistaken, my image stayed the same. At some point I even started seeking out other mirrors, in elevators or public bathrooms, because maybe something was up with my mirror at home. I took pictures from every angle. Printed them out, hung them up on the walls, examined them in every light. No, I really looked like that. 

Well, that itself that would’ve been a nice thing if it hadn’t been so weird. But you know. There’s worse things than suddenly being unreasonably good-looking. I thought, hey, at least I can pick up where I left off. With the gym I mean, and my relationship. What better wakeup call than this to go back to those healthy habits I had. With a newfound energy I went out for just a walk because I still wanted to give my body time to recover. I sat down on a park bench and enjoyed the fresh air outside. Saw people walking their dogs, young couples with strollers, just all in all a nice experience and I was happy to be among fellow humans again. It helped a little bit with the gnawing anger that I got from being ghosted, and I started to think more positively again.

That was short-lived, though. After a while I got a feeling like someone was watching me, and when I looked around, there was indeed a group of three pretty young women who’d stopped at the other end of the park and were peeking over at me. Probably thought I wouldn’t spot them. At first I found it weird, but you know, maybe they were just checking me out. Wouldn’t blame them. Hell, I’d take it as a compliment. But when I made eye contact with one of them and smiled, I could just see her face twist in real time. As if she’d been unpleasantly surprised. She turned over to her friend and they were quickly talking about something, until the other two grabbed her and quickly ushered her out of sight.

What a weird experience.

After that point, when I started going out in public and to work again, people were treating me much more coldly. Not talking to me or anything, my colleagues stopped asking how I was doing or inviting me to stuff.
I brushed it off at first, but it got worse. People started crossing the road when they saw me. Groups of girls or little children would avoid me with a wide radius, and soon even grown men. Sometimes they would just… Stare. At one point I was refused service when I went to grab a coffee. Then, it became the norm. 
They treated me like some kind of abomination. Like actually, that was the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced.

I just wanted to know why! With everything I knew, I ended up coming the conclusion that maybe, it was my face. It could ONLY be my face, the reason why this all was happening. It was like I was repulsive to them somehow though I wouldn’t know why. But that was the thing, whatever it was, it had to be bad. Because, sure, I had experienced being ugly. People are a little bit more impatient with you, ignore you more, don’t smile at you. But they don’t act as if you’re carrying the black plague. So what the hell about my appearance was making everybody acts so… Downright hostile and mortified? Whatever it was, it crushed me. Made me want to stay inside all day, not go out anymore. But I fought against that impulse because it would’ve been the final nail in the coffin. Powering through it was the only way in my mind, because I was sure that if I started hiding away from everything there would be no coming out of that hole. 

I kept going outside. Preserving normalcy best I could. But it was a hopeless effort from the start.

One time when I came up to an older man at the bus stop to help him with the ticket machine, he physically flinched away from my hand as if his life was on the line. I lost it then, I threw up my arms and I asked him what’s wrong with my face, what makes me so horrifying. He seemed uncomfortable, but I got him to talk. I made him talk to me, the first person in however long it had been at that point. I asked him if I’m ugly. He said no. I asked him to describe my face, and he said it was a normal face. Good-looking even. I took out my phone and showed him pictures of myself, I began to describe every little detail. My nose, the shape of it, my eyes and my jaw and my hair. He nodded along strongly with everything I said, saying ‘yes, yes, that’s what you look like.’
But like, if that were true, why would he react like that? Was he lying to appease me? Was I just scaring him even more? I told him to be frank with me, to be one hundred percent honest. But he quickly fled, getting on the bus that had just arrived, even though it wasn’t even the one he’d bought the ticket for.

That proved it. Something, something was wrong with my face. 

At some point I finally caved, and texted my family.

They were still ignoring me.

I called my girlfriend.

She was ignoring me. 

I called her every evening for a week.

Her Instagram account showed what she was doing, that she was still going out, having fun- As if I didn’t even exist. As If I’d never existed. Other people were commenting under her posts, and she was responding to them, saying kind words, recalling some kind of event they’d attended together recently.

Somehow, that was the last straw for me. So I arranged a trip back to the city where she still lived, and I made sure to go in the morning.
I was waiting by the bus stop where I would walk with her every day. Opened my phone to look through pictures old pictures, but for some reason some were deleted and I had some notes that were full of random, meaningless letters. For a while I just sat on the bench, wallowing in memories, and asking myself where everything went wrong. Maybe I had really done something to upset her, maybe I just didn’t know that I did. I quickly bought flowers from a street stall, ready for whatever explanation she had for this whole situation. 

She showed up way later than she usually would have, maybe she changed shifts since we last talked. But when she saw me sitting there, with the small bouquet, she screamed. It was not a loud or pained one, just like a genuinely surprised shriek. Then she stood there, frozen. 
I did not know what to say to that, it wasn’t really anything I’d prepared myself for. I tried to talk to her, ask her what’s wrong. She just kept shaking her head and telling me that no, no, nothing was wrong.
Really? Really? Nothing wrong?
I asked her about the radio silence. The pain and suffering I had to endure, how that made her feel. I told her how everyone is treating me like some hideous monster. And I demanded an explanation, for everything.

She kept repeating herself. No, no, it’s okay, she didn’t get any calls, she’s sorry.

I asked her sorry for what.

She asked me to leave her alone. To move on. 

I asked her to please call me back.

She asked me to leave her alone.

I demanded she call me back.

She agreed.

I allowed her to go.

After that incident, she did not show up at the bus stop again. I was waiting for her on workdays a few times more, but she never once came. She must have changed her daily habits just to avoid me. 

I realized with a start, how little our relationship was worth. How shallow and meaningless it was. She’d liked me for my looks, my being there, what I could offer. Now that I reached my lowest point she just wanted to be rid of me. Didn’t even dignify me with a proper breakup, a goodbye, a ‘Have a nice life’. I mean, we both know that I won’t, but still. I’m truly, truly, so heartbroken that I was right about her. About people. Because my god I thought she might be different. That this is the one place I could maybe get some support from. The fact that she didn’t even try doesn’t just make her like everyone else, it doesn’t make her callous or dismissive. It makes her downright evil.

Bitch.

And as the months passed, she never called me back. On her Instagram, she soon started appearing with one of the guys commenting under her posts, and my own mother was plastering child pictures of me all over her Facebook, without any regard for my privacy. But respond to my calls? No, why would you want to talk to your own son.

I lost my job. I think so at least, I simply stopped going. Now I walk with my head turned down, so people don’t see my face. I get my groceries late at night, where I’m unlikely to meet anyone besides the cashiers, and even they seem shaken whenever they catch a glimpse of me. If I don’t hide my features well enough. Sometimes they’re just silent, they stare, and sometimes they scream at me to get out, to never come back.
I’m sitting in a corner in an internet café not far from the block where I used to live. I can see the road leading up to it out of the window. It’s late and dark outside.

On my way to here I’ve been thinking so much. I saw a child, alone, on the sidewalk. Fixated on me. He wouldn’t move, didn’t look away, no shame. So I stopped as well, and pulled down the scarf that I had up to my nose. He began to scream and cry, piercing and shrill. Nobody else was there so I waited for him to stop. This went on and on, until he had no voice and was cowering. A sad bundle of tears. I just walked away. I had seen enough. 

And now we come full circle, internet stranger. I was going to ask you to help me. To genuinely help me and find out if I really am what I think I am. What the reactions of the people around me are telling me I am. I was going to post pictures, for you to tell me straight-up how bad it really is.
But reliving all that…

I think I changed my mind.

Whatever this is, I can’t imagine that any random person who reads this could possibly make me find peace with myself. I cannot exist with other people anymore, if just my presence makes them recoil. Who- or whatever did this to me must be one of the most evil things in the world. 

I no longer ask for your advice, simply for your sympathy. You haven’t seen my face. That means you can still feel pity for me. Please do. Please. It’ll all be worth it if just one person does, it will, in the grand scheme of things, restore some aspect of human dignity that I’ve lost. 
You have the power to award me back my humanity.

My ex is coming home soon, I think. Took me a while to find out but it seems like she does night shifts now. I’ll see her walking down the street from where I am. I’ll leave my things here on the table when that moment comes.

And she’ll tell me again that she’s sorry, that it’s not her fault, but it’s not MY fault either is it? Bad things happen every day and it’s not anybody’s fault.

Knowing what you know now, you’ll all agree that I won’t be responsible for whatever I choose to do next, right?

Anyway, I truly believe that I had a beautiful life before tragedy struck. I think I was on the right path, and the moments that I had and the ones we shared are untouchable now that they are in the past. I have my mother’s Facebook open in another window and she’s still posting those pictures. Strangers are commenting, telling her that she had a beautiful baby boy. 

I don’t see it.

But it’s a consolidation, I guess. She can keep the photos, and they will never stop looking the way they do now. She can keep this version of me if she prefers it. If everyone I’ve ever known prefers it. For all their sake and mine, I do wish it stays preserved in their memory for a long, long time. 

 There she is.",1,1732062379.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

I sleep from 9-5. If I don't, I did it wrong.

I drink two gallons of water a day. If not, it's wrong.

I drink two coffees every morning. I can't do anything unless I've had at least one. And before that I need at least half a gallon of water. My brain will spin if I don't drink enough water before my coffee.

I read at least 50 pages of a book. I feel anxiety if I don't reach that number.

At least 7,000 steps.

However, my eczema is still bad when a semester of school begins(clears up every summer but the weather where I live barely changes, so thats not a big culprit). I'm wondering if it has to do with diet as well despite what I cut out, but I'm thinking the main trigger is stress. What foods have you either cut out or incorporated in your diet?

lot of people keep telling me to check out some charity shops, which i’ve yet to do since moving here — does anyone have any go-to places for stuff like this? or, even better, have a place they might have bought their own chess set from and would recommend?

i’ve been looking at ones that would ideally fold in half and have the little pockets or room for a bag inside to keep all the pieces in, as then we could take it to coffee with us to play while we’re out. sorry for the long post! trust me to make the easiest thing in the world this stressful😅",1,1732062036.0,Aberdeen,0,1.0,False

Our Merchandise Store has now opened! [In The Great Khan's Tent Shop!](https://inthegreatkhanstent-shop.fourthwall.com/)

Welcome back to In The Great Khan's Tent from our two-month long but necessary hiatus!

We are back with even more episodes, more stories, and more content for you to enjoy! So stay tuned for even more episodes!

In this episode, we continue our exploration of the story of “The Story of Sultan ‘Umar ibn al-Nu’man and his sons Sharkhan and Dau’ al-Makan and the strange and remarkable things that happened to them” with the continuation of Nights 51, 52 and 53.

We reach the sad conclusion of the part played by Princess Abrizah, the horrid role that Sultan ‘Umar plays in that conclusion, and how Sharkhan is continually being beset by assumed threats to his succession to the throne. The conclusion of the part played by Princess Abrizah results in the snowballing actions undertaken by all the other characters including Dahat al-Dawahi.

On another note, we will be approaching our 50^(th) episode of In The Great Khan’s Tent! To celebrate this milestone we will be releasing a special episode to mark this occasion!

Stay tuned for the next episode where we continue our exciting adventure through the One Thousand and One Nights!

I’ve been single for the past three years and was on tinder and bumble for about a year and a half. In that time the attempts at relationships left me being ghosted by a number of people and actually got calls from three of them just to tell me “I’m sorry I ghosted you, you didn’t deserve that”. I haven’t dated since January but I’ve asked a couple women in person for their number/to get coffee on the weekend. Unfortunately I was met with stares that left me feeling incredibly uncomfortable until the rejection came. I have no problem with being rejected because not everyone is looking to date but how do I go about talking to a stranger now? I’ve tried bars, lounges, after making friends with the people next to me at a baseball game. I’ve asked 4people in the past maybe 8months and it’s because we end up talking till we leave.

My friend and I (both in our mid-20s) are super excited to visit London for the first time this December to celebrate my 25th birthday. We’ll be landing on December 18th at 10 AM and staying until the morning of December 27th, so we have about 8 full days to explore this amazing city.

Here’s what we’re hoping to do:

\- Christmas Events: We want to soak in all the holiday vibes and explore Christmas markets, festive light displays, and unique seasonal events.

\- Theater: Suggestions for must-see West End shows or other performances?

\- Food & Cafes: We love trying different cuisines (we eat chicken, and my friend also loves seafood). We’re especially looking for hidden gem cafes, the best hot chocolate, bakeries, croissants, and coffee. We also have an Indian restaurant on our list but would love recommendations for other iconic London eats.

\- Shopping: We want to explore thrift shops, vintage stores, and designer shopping (open to both affordable and high-end suggestions).

\- Iconic Places: Notting Hill (especially the famous bookstore), Westminster Abbey, and other can’t-miss landmarks.

\- Day Trips: If we can fit it in, we’d love to visit Paris for a day or explore the Cotswolds. Are these feasible with our itinerary?

\- Hidden Gems: Any unique spots or experiences that tourists often miss?

Details:

\- Accommodation: Staying with a friend near Queen Mary University (East London).

\- Budget: We’re trying to keep total expenses (food, transport, entry fees) within $1,000-$2,000 excluding shopping.

\- Transportation: We plan to use public transport, so tips on getting around efficiently would be great.

\- Focus: A balance of sightseeing, indulging in great food, exploring neighborhoods, and shopping (without wasting time or getting overwhelmed!).

If anyone could help us create a \*detailed daily itinerary\*, we’d be so grateful. This trip is super special to us, and we want to make the most of it.

Thank you so much in advance! Any advice, recommendations, or tips for first-time visitors would be amazing. 😊",2,1732061606.0,Europetravel,2,1.0,False
1gvc9mp,https://v.redd.it/93zmpoib8y1e1,Magnetic Mask + RAW video = Insanity,"Ok, disclaimer, it’s not perfect…. And this was inside of (an extremely poorly lit) Starbucks.  I recently picked up an Atomos Shogun Ultra to record 6K, 12 bit ProRes RAW.  (For those who don’t know, with RAW with certain cameras, you can change the ISO & white balance after the fact)

And before anybody asks why I didn’t turn around and use the outside light, Starbucks has a policy about shooting video in their coffee shops.  You can’t risk getting staff / patrons in their videos.  So this is one of the few angles that’s actually safe.

Also, there’s an ND filter on the camera cranked all the way up to preserve the background.

So here was the shot.  A VERY hard shot to fix in post.

To do this:

I duplicated the clip in Finder, and then applied de-noise to that clip with Neat Video - the clip I’m masking myself out of (remember, RAW video uses all the raw sensor data so there’s no internal camera noise reduction)

Applied the magnetic mask to the footage AFTER the de-noise process.  With the ISO changed to 10,000.  Feather set to -100 which improves the outline a lot, but it’s not perfect. (Watch for outlines and artifacts near the end).

On the bottom layer (the layer without magnetic mask), I ran the de-noise on that clip after changing its ISO to 4000 (this is a Panasonic S5II, the native ISOs are 640 & 4000)

Trimmed the magnetic mask clip so it would line up with the finger snap.

It’s not perfect, but this got extremely usable.  If I spent more time with it, I could probably clean it up a ton.  But I’m very happy with what’s possible 👌🏾

1gvc9d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gvc9d5/the_missing_half/,THE MISSING HALF ,"  The engine sputtered as I pulled into the driveway, the old pickup rattling its discontent. I let out a sigh that tasted like stale coffee and regret, gripping the steering wheel harder than necessary. It had been another soul-sucking day at the plant—machines groaning, bosses barking, and me trying to pretend the world didn’t feel a little dimmer every damn second.  



But then I saw her.  

Emily. My baby girl. Seven years old and the spitting image of her mother when she still smiled. She stood in the driveway, her pigtails bouncing as the evening breeze tousled them. Her grin stretched wide, a gap where her front tooth had been. Her laughter echoed faintly in my head, though she hadn’t spoken yet.  

“Hey, pumpkin!” I called out, dragging myself out of the cab. “What’re you doin’ out here by yourself?”  

She didn’t answer. She just stood there, smiling, her hands clasped behind her back like she was hiding something. Her favorite blue dress was pristine, not a speck of dirt or a wrinkle. Strange, considering she couldn’t walk from the house to the mailbox without getting smeared in mud or grass stains.  

As I took a step closer, my boots crunching on the gravel, a chill crawled up my spine. Something was... wrong.  

Her legs were gone.  

Not like they were folded behind her or hidden. Gone. The sharp line of her torso ended just below her hips, clean as a butcher’s cut. She wasn’t bleeding, wasn’t struggling. She just... hovered there, impossibly balanced above the ground, her smile fixed like it had been stitched onto her face.  

“Jesus Christ,” I whispered, my heart jackhammering against my ribs.  

“Daddy,” she finally said, her voice sweet and airy, like she hadn’t noticed half her body was missing. “I waited for you.”  

I stumbled back, the ground beneath me feeling like it might give way. My hand fumbled for the door handle of the truck. “What the hell is this? Emily, are you—are you okay?”  

Her head tilted, that same damn smile stretching wider. “Why wouldn’t I be, Daddy?”  

My stomach churned, bile crawling up my throat as I scanned the yard, desperate for any sign of a rational explanation. Maybe it was a trick. A sick, twisted prank. But there was no one else—just me, the truck, and the girl who was half there.  

“Where’s your mom?” I demanded, the words coming out sharper than I intended.  

“She’s inside.” Her hand twitched, motioning toward the house.  

I froze. My wife—Lisa—had been distant lately. Too distant. The kind of distant that made you think about lawyers and custody battles. But this? This wasn’t something Lisa would—could—do.  

“Stay right there, baby,” I croaked, though the absurdity of the command hit me like a slap. Stay right there. Like she could go anywhere.  

I edged toward the front door, every nerve in my body screaming for me to run. But I couldn’t leave her out here. Not like this.  

The house was dark, the porch light flickering weakly as I shoved the door open. “Lisa?” I called, my voice bouncing off the silence.  

The smell hit me first.  

Coppery and thick, like the scent of pennies left too long in a sweaty palm. My boots squelched as I stepped inside, the floor sticky beneath me.  

“Oh, God,” I whispered, my voice trembling.  

The living room was chaos. Blood painted the walls in wild, looping arcs, like someone had wielded a brush in a blind fury. Furniture was overturned, the TV shattered, its screen spitting static like a broken radio.  

And there she was.  

Lisa. What was left of her, anyway. Her torso was splayed out on the couch, her arms twisted at unnatural angles. Her legs—those were gone, too. Just like Emily’s.  

“What the fuck is this?” I choked out, bile threatening to spill as I staggered back.  

A faint giggle echoed behind me.  

I turned, my heart lurching as Emily floated into the doorway, still smiling, her hands now stained crimson. “I told you I waited for you, Daddy.”  

My breath hitched. “What did you do?”  

Her smile faltered for the briefest second, then returned with something darker behind it. Something ancient and hungry. “It’s not what I did,” she said, her voice lilting like a nursery rhyme. “It’s what \*we\* did.”  

The shadows in the room seemed to stretch, curling toward me like living things. My knees buckled, and I dropped to the floor, my head spinning as her laughter filled the room, high and shrill and wrong.  

“Emily,” I rasped, my vision swimming. “You’re not—this isn’t you. What are you?”  

Her face twisted, her eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. “I’m your daughter, silly,” she said, her voice warping as her form began to shift. “Don’t you love me?”  

The last thing I saw before everything went black was her smile—wide and endless, a maw of teeth ready to consume.  



I woke in the hospital days later, or so they told me. There was no sign of Lisa. No Emily. Just a wrecked house and a shattered man.  

They called it a breakdown. Said I’d been overworked, hallucinating.  

But every time I close my eyes, I see her. My daughter’s smiling face, and the shadows that linger behind her.",3,1732061553.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Our Merchandise Store has now opened! [In The Great Khan's Tent Shop!](https://inthegreatkhanstent-shop.fourthwall.com/)

Welcome back to In The Great Khan's Tent from our two-month long but necessary hiatus!

We are back with even more episodes, more stories, and more content for you to enjoy! So stay tuned for even more episodes!

In this episode, we continue our exploration of the story of “The Story of Sultan ‘Umar ibn al-Nu’man and his sons Sharkhan and Dau’ al-Makan and the strange and remarkable things that happened to them” with the continuation of Nights 51, 52 and 53.

We reach the sad conclusion of the part played by Princess Abrizah, the horrid role that Sultan ‘Umar plays in that conclusion, and how Sharkhan is continually being beset by assumed threats to his succession to the throne. The conclusion of the part played by Princess Abrizah results in the snowballing actions undertaken by all the other characters including Dahat al-Dawahi.

My friend and I (both in our mid-20s) are super excited to visit London for the first time this December to celebrate my 25th birthday. We’ll be landing on December 18th at 10 AM and staying until the morning of December 27th, so we have about 8 full days to explore this amazing city. 

Here’s what we’re hoping to do:

\- Christmas Events: We want to soak in all the holiday vibes and explore Christmas markets, festive light displays, and unique seasonal events.

\- Theater: Suggestions for must-see West End shows or other performances?

\- Food & Cafes: We love trying different cuisines (we eat chicken, and my friend also loves seafood). We’re especially looking for hidden gem cafes, the best hot chocolate, bakeries, croissants, and coffee. We also have an Indian restaurant on our list but would love recommendations for other iconic London eats.

\- Shopping: We want to explore thrift shops, vintage stores, and designer shopping (open to both affordable and high-end suggestions).

\- Iconic Places: Notting Hill (especially the famous bookstore), Westminster Abbey, and other can’t-miss landmarks.

\- Day Trips: If we can fit it in, we’d love to visit Paris for a day or explore the Cotswolds. Are these feasible with our itinerary?

\- Hidden Gems: Any unique spots or experiences that tourists often miss?

Details:

\- Accommodation: Staying with a friend near Queen Mary University (East London).

\- Budget: We’re trying to keep total expenses (food, transport, entry fees) within $1,000-$2,000 excluding shopping.

\- Transportation: We plan to use public transport, so tips on getting around efficiently would be great.

\- Focus: A balance of sightseeing, indulging in great food, exploring neighborhoods, and shopping (without wasting time or getting overwhelmed!).

If anyone could help us create a \*detailed daily itinerary\*, we’d be so grateful. This trip is super special to us, and we want to make the most of it. 

Thank you so much in advance! Any advice, recommendations, or tips for first-time visitors would be amazing. 😊",1,1732061481.0,LondonTravel,7,1.0,False

Brewed a cup of B&W Mewa (Ethiopian natural), standard 4:6 recipe with 15g coffee, 1:15 ratio, 91C. 45s bloom, 45g pours x5 including the bloom. Only difference was I ground a little finer than usual on my ZP6 because I heard these papers are really fast.

The difference was much larger than I expected.

The brew resulted in a much brighter cup with more vibrant acidity and fruit notes. 

It ALSO resulted in a fuller, smoother body. 

The combination of both those two effects was really unexpected because usually it's either one way or the other.

My wife said it almost tasted like a different bean altogether.

Finally, the bed didn't cave during the bloom and stayed very even throughout (not sure if this has anything to do with the filter or just inconsistencies in my morning pour).

The filters are a bit flimsy though and kind of annoying to get them to unfold, seat into the dripper, and stick to the sides when pre-wetting.

Anyone else have experience with these?

It took a lot longer than I anticipated, by about 2 years, due to lots of life reasons such as death in the family, severe depression, several close family members with grave diagnoses, betrayal and so much more. 

I can tell you all, that WGU is as hard, if not harder than traditional brick and mortar colleges. How do I know that? I went to a brick and mortar college for my first BA. To the detractors for WGU, saying it’s not the same as brick and mortar colleges, you are right, it’s better, because why do I have to waste my time for a class where I already know the material, and sit in a classroom for 5 months of the year. I’d rather test out and make sure I give extra time to the classes that need it. 

I posted here occasionally, but mainly used this sub as a reference for some of the harder classes. Without this community I probably would have given up hope last year and just dropped out. 

Some pointers, make use of the campus resources if you need them, like BetterHelp. I used my own insurance for therapy, but still, if you need help, you need help. 

Be aware of burn out, and pace yourself, some of the harder classes could be information dense (looking at you, CompTIA Net+). 

Reach out to your instructors and mentor when you get stuck in a class, but reach out to friends and family when you get stuck mentally. Take good care of yourself mentally and you will succeed. 

It’s okay if you can’t accelerate, some people can, and some can’t, you aren’t a failure, you are just you, and you should feel proud about that. Conversely, if you are struggling to pass your classes for whatever reason, let your mentor know, they can help you with connecting you to resources for both classes and life. There were two terms that I only completed one class, because my life basically fell to shit for a bit. I let my mentor know what happened, and told him I’d do my best, but at some points in time my best was literally just waking up for work for the day.

i just finished reading this [Afterman coffee book](https://coheed.fandom.com/wiki/The_Afterman_(book)#Part_One:_Ascension) and really gone thru each song and listened while reading and then g oing back to read lyrics and understanding it so much more. I absolutely loved it. It gave SOOOOOO much more context to seemingly random choices by claudio/the band. Understanding the perspective of lyrics i've sung for YEARS and never known. It almost brought me to tears. i cannot recommend it enough to anyoine that hasnt.

  
However, that experience seems to be isolated to the afterman albums. Obviously not every album would have a companion novel with it but i was hoping there was some way to go thru and do the same thing. Read a song bases synopsis of the story in that song then read lyrics and keep going. But i havent found a good way to do it. There's overall synopsis' ""this album is about dr xx fighting yyy"" blah balh. which is cool but not as fulfilling as i'd like.

  
The coheed fandom wiki has failed me on that front. anyone have any other suggestions to help me out?

i plan on using antnee83's guide for the whole process. after seeing so many of their homemade pieces im confident enough in their methods to try it out myself. this is a very large container so the guide will be used more for the things i need to use, not so much for the ratios. 

i know i will probably have to experiment a bit to get things flowing like i want because of the size of the glass. first thing i will be using is a coil made specifically for heating. also will be using a reflective bulb because of the heating efficiency ive found using them in my blue and yellow lamp (which is set up using a 40w reflective bulb  with a dimmer switch) for the base and hat I'll probably use a coffee can.

my issues at hand are how will i seal the top. im thinking of using a silcone plug of some kind, but im worried about expansion.

Hello all, 


I am recently divorced. I work a lot. I’m an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I’m rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who’s serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I’m also an ass man so bonus points if you’re a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that’s me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs but I’m not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain’t going to work. 
A bit more about me below ⬇️ 

* 41, Caucasian, 6’1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you’ll meet. Period. 
* I’m a Dad of 2 beautiful kids. 
* I’m a big nerd, love space and comics, sci fi and horror. Games. 
* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you! 

Lastly, I know what I want & I know what I’m ready for. I’m getting tired of people telling ME that I’m not ready for something. The only person who can truly know that is myself. Same goes for you. I don’t want a penpal and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.  

I am looking for WOMEN ONLY. 
Men, please stop asking. One more thing. Please be free and unattached from your exs. Please don’t live with your ex still, please don’t be “on and off” with your ex still. If you co parent, cool, so do I, but it’s actually crazy how many people aren’t fully detached from their ex’s. I know this is long but if you’ve made it this far, I hope to hear from you!

Husband & daddy to two baby girls (three and one years old). I met my wife in college and we’ve been married for a little over four years now. 

After we got engaged, my wife told me there was something serious she needed to tell me before we got married. I learned that when she was around six years old, she was molested by her cousin who was in sixth grade at the time. It went on for several months, and it didn’t come out until her mom took her to a psychologist because she was acting out so much (I.e. wetting the bed, having meltdowns, fighting at school). I won’t get into details, but the things he did were extreme and things that no young children should be subjected to. I actually got teary hearing about it, and it was the first time my wife had ever seen my cry.

The cousin pleaded guilty to the crime in juvenile court and it came out that he had also been molested as a child. The cousin served some time in juvenile prison and also got help for his issues. According to my wife, both he and his mother have taken responsibility and expressed genuine remorse. The cousin and my wife have had a few face to face meeting over the years and he’s told her repeatedly how sorry he is and how much guilt he feels for putting her in the position. He’s also asked if there is anything he can do for her and has even offered to pay for her therapy, which my wife has declined. My wife has forgiven him, and feels sorry about what he went through as a child and also the intense guilt he feels for his actions. The families don’t socialize or spend holidays together anymore because it’s too painful for everyone involved, but I don’t think there are bad feelings anymore. With that being said, my wife and her older brother are clear that they don’t want their kids near him after what happened. 

My wife is actually a juvenile defense attorney now and represents a lot of young kids like her cousin. She’s great at her job and has a ton of empathy for the kids she works with. I can see how one would have empathy for kids who have been through a lot and then commit crimes, but it’s much harder for me to be understanding towards my wife’s cousin since I’ve seen first hand how much this has impacted her. She has night terrors sometimes, impulsively jerks when someone touches certain parts of her body (I.e. lower back), and had a lot of trouble enjoying sex when we first started dating. I’m glad that my wife has found peace and forgives her cousin, but I personally don’t feel anything but rage when I think of him.

Anyways, last night, my wife sat me down and told me she had something to speak with me about. Her cousin called her and expressed that he has a new girlfriend. He’s been upfront with the woman about his history and about what he did to my wife when she was little. The woman now wants to have a conversation with my wife to better understand the situation, and my wife has agreed to meet them for coffee and describe the what happened and how it’s impacted her. My wife told me that she also wants to stress that her cousin took responsibility immediately, has expressed genuine remorse over the years, served his time without complaint, and has gone to therapy to work through his issues. My wife says she isn’t trying to sway his girlfriend or tell her how to feel about it, but is instead trying to give her a complete picture of what happened. 

My wife asked if I would come too, because the cousin wants to have a conversation with me as well to express his remorse. He made this offer shortly after we got married,  but I told my wife I wasn’t in a place to be receptive to his apology. Once again, I told my wife that I’m probably not going to be receptive to an apology. I also said that if he’s trying to convince his girlfriend to that he’s not a terrible person, I shouldn’t be there because I’ll definitely thwart his plans. 

My wife seemed confused and asked what I meant, and I said I’m pissed about what he did and can’t sit back and listen to her describe what a model citizen he’s been after he raped her and not lose my shit. My wife said that he’s done everything right since the event occurred and asked what else I expect of him. I said I don’t expect anything, but I don’t want to be in the same room as someone who did such terrible things to her. My wife reminded me that he was a child at the time and was also being abused at home and said we need to take those things into account when evaluating his moral culpability. I said that when I was in sixth grade, I wouldn’t have dreamed of raping an innocent six year old. I said that their cousin hurt her, and as her husband, there’s nothing in my eyes that will ever change that. I also said I don’t believe she truly thinks her cousin has changed, since she and her brother won’t allow their children near the guy.

My wife got teary and said that she’d never take any kind of risk with our children even if she was 99.9% sure he’d changed. She also said I was making what happened about my feelings.

For context, I've been a bartender and cocktail server at my current job for 3+ years, I'm 28 y.o I would like to get into a barista position because where I'm moving, I think the position would work with my schedule and mold well.to my other job; be complimentary. 
I'm planning on moving within a year..the only coffee place that has even called me back is 25 minutes away and basically is potentially offering a runner position. I asked if there was the potential to move up and they said yes, it just depends on if people leave and ""seniority"" that it could possibly happen after about 6 months (no guarantees).
I have been trying to leave my current job for a while because I don't like the position anymore and business isn't great. 
I feel like if I take this job; I might make worse money, I'll have to work for highschoolers essentially (managers words, and that's fine but could cause friction), might not even move into a barista position before I move, have to travel longer BUT it would look good on a resume when I do move and possibly help pit in that way, and would get me out of the job that I've been unhappy with for the past year.

1gvbqrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Predators/comments/1gvbqrl/trotz_talks_out_west_edition/,"Trotz Talks, Out West Edition","TLDR: We're getting better, I'm not firing Bruno, I'm shopping but not at the luxury stores 😂

**Let’s start with the road trip. You got the win on Sunday night and that was a much needed win following tough loss on Friday. You’ve talked about this trip a lot for this team to turn it around. Do you sense that’s happening or are you worried?**

I’m actually encouraged more than anything. We’ve been able to get points. Very hard game against Edmonton, thought we deserved a point, hoping to get two. Then next night we played Calgary, thought Calgary played outstanding game and we weren’t able to find the back of net. Went into Vancouver and thought we played well but spent too much time in our own end. But we’re collecting points, five points out of a playoff position. We’ve got to continue to collect points. I feel like we’re playing better. We’re ninth in special teams in terms of power play. PK is number one in the league. Defensive game has got better, but we need to do better five on five. It’s trending up but it’s not where we need it to be. I think we’re trending in the right areas, we’re working hard, don’t feel there’s any quit and feels there’s some urgency in the locker room. The players themselves know where they are. They’re not dumb, they’re smart, good players and they understand where we are but we’re going to have to grind for every point. We’re not going to get it back overnight, so we’ve got to keep grinding and collecting points. Would like another win but feel like we’ve had a good trip.

**Loss in Colorado/Edmonton: if this were any normal November where you started off other than 0-5, I could live with those results. But given the start, at what point is it like hey, it’s good that the game’s starting to come together, that we got a point, but we have to win these games because of the hole we dug?**

You’re right, if we started 2-2-1, we’d be one point out of a playoff spot instead of five. Your mentality is you want to get it back right away but the reality is it’s going to take you two months to get it back because everybody’s playing and collecting points and you’ve got to stay with it. Once you start believing in your game, you can go on a four or five game run and make some ground up. But it’s going to be something that we’ve dug ourselves a hole and for us to dig ourselves out, it might take all 62 remaining games. But you have to have the belief that you can and you will.

Team is trying hard to cater to new acquisitions and allow them to fit in, get a little bit of a role and it has probably set us back by trying too hard. What you’re seeing now is Andrew’s settled in to certain things that aren’t working. You’ve got Forsberg, Marchessault, Stamkos on different lines with 4th line being identity and spreading it out might be the secret sauce. Getting everybody going at the same time would be helpful but that hasn’t been the case. Thought we’d have a better start but the reality is you look back at the summer, Skjei replaces McD, Stamkos & Marchessault added to help the special teams, which they have, but they need to help five on five. There hasn’t been that big of a change, but the names have star power and it’s taken longer than we expected. Talked to a lot of GMs at the HOF ceremony and said when they added big names (paraphrasing) it took time. Try to put good people in good positions and hopefully the whole thing gels together. Coaching staff  working hard to make that happen.

**Heard some rumors over the weekend that you’ve been making a lot of calls. Rumors are you’re looking for more established guys, top 4D with term. You really haven’t touched draft picks. I was thinking if this team was in contention you might unload to get a guy here or there, but with where you are in the standings, how do you view the futures market and adding to that with more NHL ready players?**

Well, I look at it this way. The plan that I think I expressed on your show and to you and everybody is that I’m bringing in a few players that are established. They’re going to hopefully make us a threat and get us in the playoffs and try to build a top nine that will be placeholders until we get the kids ready. I’m not going to deviate from the plan. We’ve got a lot of young players that are developing, getting better, getting more ready. When I said maybe some roster construction, that may be as simple as some of the younger players come in and we move out a player to make room. At this point in time I’m not interested in moving first round picks for established players. The plan is a long term plan so we have a really good hockey team in Nashville for a long time so I’m not going to do anything knee jerk to set us back. I think we’ve got a roster that is coming in behind the existing roster that is going to be a good one for a long, long time. I trust the group. I’ve always said, show me that you’re there or you’re going to be close to there, I’ll help you out but if not then we’ll go in a different direction. Your team tells you where you are. I can’t tell them, you can’t tell them. The team itself tells everybody where they are and I’m going to listen to the team based on how they play, where they are. They could tell me that they’re there, but they’re going to have to show me. And if they are, then we’ll look to always improve our club. I have made calls. I’m not trying to take away and burn it down. I’m trying to make sure that anybody we bring in is a little bit of a longer term solution. Not looking for a rental; looking for players that will be here a couple years and make us better.

**When it comes to calling other teams for a 4D man or a 2C, are you saying high end prospects would be out of the discussion because that’s the future and you’re still looking to add to the current roster, or would you be willing to move some of those premium assets to add to current roster?**

I think both apply honestly. If it’s the right player that’s a little bit of a long term solution, then I would … to get those players you have to give up some premium assets. But if it’s not there I’m not going to force it. I’m not looking to trade a premium asset for a marginal or average player. It would have to be one that would knock your socks off a little bit. We’re going to be very, very conscious of that because we’ve got some good players coming. Kemell is having a really good year so far. Building this team with the future in mind, but with the present. If we could add a 20 something high prospect, maybe a young established NHL’er that will be a long term guy then yeah, I would step back and allow one of our premium guys to be part of a trade. But unless it’s something that’s really really strong that helps the future and the now, I won’t look at it.

**Is anybody talking about that at this point in the season?**

Very few. There’s probably a few teams in a position similar to us, a few maybe going in a different direction or have multiple assets at a position. They’re starting to talk. A lot of people talk about Thanksgiving, but I look at it 20 games in. Our team started out 0-5 and I think we’re 6-5-3 since. We’re trending up. Special teams are good, we’ve got to get five on five going, our goaltending is good. We’ve got to pull together and they’re slowly pulling it together. Adversity makes you stronger and that brings teams together.

**I’m going to say I’m worried about this but idk if thats how I’d phrase it. I remember last year how long it took for the team to hit their stride. Then I remember when you added Beau and it felt like it took a month before he started contributing. And I’m starting to think this might be a trend with Bruno’s system. There’s a part of me that thinks that this is going to click but by the time it does, it might be too late. The reason I bring that up is because I just saw Boston fired Montgomery. So I’m thinking to myself if you’re spending all this time getting these guys acclimated to Bruno’s system but it might take too long this year, where does that put you given the fact that I think it would be crazy if it started to click …. if you spend all this time trying to get everybody up to snuff on Bruno’s system, they finally do, and then changing the coach, I feel like would set you back, but I also know how there’s only so many games and everybody’s competitive and I know how this league works. How do you process how long it’s taking these guys to get this and what do you do if it takes too long?**

I wish I had the right answer for you. You have to trust your instincts. Is the team getting better, playing the right way more consistently, is some of the inconsistency due to schedule? Do you have enough depth in some of the key positions if someone gets hurt? I don’t have a crystal ball but I can tell you that if you said you have 62 games left and we seem to be trending a little bit better, then I’d say we’ve got enough time. But at the same time if you start trending down are you going to panic or stay with it?

I always trust my instincts and I’ll go with my instincts and when I know over what people say or think, it doesn’t bother me one way or the other. I’ve got to use my experience and my instincts. I think we have enough talent to make the playoffs but it’s going to be a grind and an uphill struggle because we’re chasing it and there’s a lot of good teams.

**Where it comes to Bruno, how you feel like the players and he are working together. You said everybody’s going to do this together, he’s going to do it with you guys. I know what it looks like when a team’s quit and I know your team hasn’t quit. So I wonder what you see when it comes to him and the players and where they sit together getting this team out of this.**

I think you watch the interaction between the players and coaches. You know when people are engaged and aren’t engaged. I look for those cues as a GM. Andrew has been a player’s coach. He believes in the players, in playing the right way, in them getting better. He’s lived those situations, he can talk it out with them and he has. I know on this trip he’s had lots of one on ones. I see him out for coffee with this player and that player. The players recognize that, when a coach is really trying to help. And he has been. So I would say that the engagement between the coaches and the players has been very good. Would we like better results? Yes, no question. But players always will let you know if they’re not engaged. They won’t make eye contact, you’ll hear bickering behind the scenes, and you can feel it. It’s like a coworker when you don’t get along with them and they walk in the room and the mood changes. When the players and coach don’t get along, it’s the same type of feeling. That is not the case at all. I’m really encouraged by what we are capable of doing in the future here. So I’m looking forward for us to dig out of this hole and get back home. We’ll have some tough games. There’s no gimmes in this league. We’ve got our work cut out for us but we’re not afraid of the challenge.

**I can get a feel for when you really like somebody.  And I saw that you said that you expect Svechkov to maybe make an appearance sooner rather than later. What sort of impact do you think he could make to the lineup on the top three lines?**

He’s a very smart, cerebral player. The biggest adjustment for every player that comes up …. Happy was leading playoffs in scoring and in Milwaukee and he comes to NHL and he’s mostly playing on fourth line and playing well. But it is a big jump. A guy like Svech, I know he can play. He thinks the game at this level. It’ll be getting his pace. There’s not as much space as in the AHL. It’s a lot more chaotic. Sometimes it’s easier in the NHL for players with a high hockey IQ because they’re positionally in their spots a lot quicker, etc. Sometimes those guys can enhance their game further but it’ll be the pace.

Barry loves the positivity Jared has. Stillman basically has to force him off the phone 😂

**Post Trotz Talks:**

Stillman is not happy with himself, he doesn’t think he conducted a good interview, especially when it came to … I’m asking questions but I want to be honest with everybody including him and you and I told him what I thought but it was kind of in a round about way.

Here’s what I think is going to happen. I think Trotz is totally on board with Bruno, not even thinking about firing him, not interested in any talk about firing the coach and I’m okay with it.  I think what’s going to happen is it’s going to click for this team, for whatever reason it takes forever to learn Bruno’s system, but once you do, you play it pretty well. Beau is a good example of this. Stamkos will be Stamkos, Marchessault will be Marchessault, Brady Skjei won’t suck. And I think it will be too late. (Tells story about Hal talking about a Toronto team he was on that got hot and nobody wanted to play them, then they missed playoffs by one point.) I think this team will miss the playoffs. And when that happens, there will be a lot of calls to change the coach, this huge belief that there were sky high expectations and they didn’t even make the layoffs, change the coach. And 95% of the time I’d say do it. But if what I think is going to happen happens, I don’t want to change the coach. If you spend all that time learning Bruno’s system, you finally learn it, and then you get good at it and then you fire Bruno, a new coach comes in and the same thing. Maybe I’m wrong about that. But that’s what I think is going to happen. And if that happens, I don’t want to fire the coach. I don’t think Barry’s going to change the coach now, and I don’t think he should. I know when a team’s quit and I don’t think this team is quitting. Takes Trotz’s word for it that there’s no behind the scenes bickering, etc.",19,1732060131.0,Predators,8,1.0,False

I've quit coffee and opted for things like floral teas and is been great! Though, I do have soke kind of FOMO because of all the benefits of drinking coffee and all.

Reason I quit:

1) my family makes their coffee sweet. I used to like that but now I feel like it just masked the bad taste of the coffee.

2)no more crashes. I used to drink coffee at 7 am and 6:30 pm as it was tradition and I had a crash at around 12:30 afternoon. Nowadays I just make some flavourless blue tea and though it tastes not like much, it's pretty and I grow the flowers myself. Not to flex but I even found the seeds from a wild plant while foraging.

3)life just feels brighter. When I wake up, the sky looks just a lil bit bluer, the blues a bit more yellow and the greenery more green. Its like I feel kid-like again.",1,1732058792.0,teenagers,18,0.67,False

I don’t know where you are right now or when we’ll finally meet (or maybe meet again), but I like to think you’re out there somewhere, dreaming big and working hard, just like me. Maybe you’re sipping coffee after a long day, or maybe you’re lost in your own thoughts, wondering about the person who’ll share your life. Well, here I am, writing this letter to the man I hope to call mine someday.

I imagine you as someone who values loyalty, integrity, and courage—traits I try to embody every day. Because I think these are very hard to uphold, unless done habitually.
I hope you’re someone who can handle my stubborn streak but also appreciate my quiet strength and fierce loyalty. I’m not perfect, but I promise to always strive to be better for you, for us.

My life has been a patchwork of dreams and decisions, some harder than others. I’ve walked away from paths that didn’t feel right, not because I gave up, but because I was searching for something truer, something more meaningful. That’s the kind of love I want with you—one that feels like home, where effort is mutual and growth is inevitable.

I want us to laugh until we cry, to have silly arguments over which movies to watch, which politician is better, and to discover new things together—books, places, maybe even our quirks. I hope we can sit in silence without it feeling awkward, just soaking in each other’s presence. And when the storms of life hit (because they will), I want us to weather them together, hand in hand, our faith in each other unshaken.

I hope you’ll love my quirks as much as I’ll love yours. I’m not flashy, and I don’t need extravagant gestures. A thoughtful note, a gentle touch, or a warm smile when you catch me off guard is more than enough. I want to be your safe space, just as I hope you’ll be mine.

I’ll cheer for your victories and stand by you in your defeats. I’ll challenge you to be better, and I hope you’ll do the same for me. We don’t have to be perfect; we just have to be us.

Until the day we meet—or realize we were meant to be all along—I’ll keep working on myself. I’ll keep striving for my dreams, learning to love myself more deeply so I can love you with the fullness you deserve.

I can’t wait to meet you, to learn your favorite songs and what keeps you up at night. To build a life with you, where every day is a reminder of how lucky we are to have found each other.

Here’s to our future, Love. I’ll see you when the time is right.",4,1732058743.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1gvb70a,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1gvb70a/tifu_by_drinking_iced_tea/,TIFU by drinking iced tea,"I’m a college student, and I have a 9:35AM class every Tuesday and Friday. Before class, I usually order some food and coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts to eat during class. This morning, I decided to try something different, and got some iced tea. I sipped it on the way to class, as I always do with my coffee. I was late today, so people were glancing at me as I walked in to find a seat. We were also on a zoom video conference with another professor and class from a different university, and my class is fairly small (25-30 students), so it’s noticeable that I snuck in. I’m sitting there for 2 minutes, and I start to feel extremely nauseous. I brush it off and take another sip of iced tea, thinking the cold would help. I start salivating, and realize I’m about to puke any second. I BOLTED out of class towards the bathroom next door, and made it just in time. I started spewing clear liquid into the toilet, which unfortunately came with a lot of retching and groaning noises that people in my class could hear. After a few minutes it was over, and I stood there panting. I rarely throw up, so it’s weird that it happened, especially on an empty stomach (as evidenced by the clear vomit). I had to do the walk of shame back into my class, to pack my stuff up and go home (which was all recorded on the zoom). I could see my professor just staring at me as I walked away. I can’t believe that in COLLEGE I’m the kid who randomly threw up in class like in elementary school 😭. I called my mom to tell her I frew up, and she told me drinking iced tea on an empty stomach makes her nauseous. I googled it, and tea can cause nausea and vomiting on an empty stomach, because of the tannins. So there’s nothing wrong with me, I’m not sick, I just accidentally induced vomiting at 9:40AM in the middle of class. 

TL;DR: I drank iced tea on an empty stomach, which can apparently induce vomiting, so I had to rush out of my college class to go throw up. ",25,1732058677.0,tifu,12,0.84,False

I AM HIGH ON CAFFEINE RIGHT NOW AND HAVE JUST FINISHED READING THIS MARVELLOUS 5 STAR BOOK AND I NOW FEEL COMPELLED TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS WITH YOU GIRLIE POPS. BUCKLE UP FOR THE RIDE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

Emily being different from other stereotypical FMCs is so refreshing. She admits to her selfishness- with wanting to rescue De Grey solely to find the nexus- We need to appreciate that the girl is capable of achieving whatever she sets her mind to, and her poisoning Wendell's stepmother was so well thought out, especially considering her befuddled state as a result of having spent too much time in Faerie. I liked that there was no ""chosen one"" trope, but rather Emily just heavily relied on her scholarly instincts to help her get out of sticky situations unscathed.

Emily is one thing, BUT DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON WENDELL BECAUSE I ASSURE YOU WILL NEVER SHUTUP. The day Wendell turned back time to behead a faerie 3 times for hurting Emily was the day he got promoted to my favorite MMC. Let me tell you he gets even more swoon worthy in the second book. Therefore, I have now declared him the blueprint and standard: find yourself a man who has spent over 9 years waiting for you to notice him and would spend 9 more waiting for you to accept his marriage proposal, find yourself a man who would never underestimate your potential (even if you have none), and lastly find yourself a man who would tailor your WHOLE wardrobe himself if you were to ask.

Overall, I cannot wait for the third book to be released!! In the meanwhile here are some quotes that made me giggle (Wendell and Emily have immaculate banter):

-“A pen, then.” “Goddamn you.” I found one of my pens in another pocket and tossed it at him. “If you’ve magicked any of my books, I will shove you into that river with the sheerie.”

-“Can’t you sense what enchantments are stored in the stones?” I demanded. “No!” I threw my hands up in frustration. “Then why do you keep on breaking them?” “Because you told me to, you lunatic!”


-“We could have made more coffee,” I muttered, taking a sip. “This tastes like the floor now.” “It does not,” he said, as offended as if he’d made it himself.


-“I didn’t want to worry you,” he said. “You failed miserably.” “Miserably?” He looked so delighted that I pushed him over.",14,1732058619.0,fantasyromance,3,0.95,False

Let’s Create Unforgettable Moments Together ,"Hey, I’m Jake, your future partner in crime (or at least in video games).

I’m 33, 6’0”, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Seriously, Maine is the most forested state in the U.S., and that’s where I was born and raised. I’m a lean 180 pounds (usually closer to 165, but let’s blame the munchies for the extra padding).

A bit about me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you love a good breakfast. I’ve also got a knack for cooking up a killer breakfast, pancakes, bacon, the works. If you’re into lazy Sunday mornings, I’ve got you covered.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It’s important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there’s mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who’s not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you’re the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we’ll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I’m looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it’s a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let’s make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we can make each other laugh? Or maybe I’ll just have to show you that my breakfast skills are no joke.",1,1732057874.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

This guy is sweet but I just don't have a use case for it, brand new in every way, bits never used as well.

***Next up is the Vault Case Secure in Orange, (***[***Vault Retail***](https://vaultcase.co/products/vaultsecure?variant=40139393466449)***)***

Bought this with the intention of holding my Spydie collection in it but the web got too damned big. Like new all over, never even left the house.

This thing is neat, has a resettable locking mechanism that locks the zippers into place, obviously not some bolted to the ground safe but it'll do in a pinch, has cutouts on the reverse side to make it a disassembly tray on the go. Variety of sizes included to fit a bunch of different EDC schtuff.

***And last up is kind of the freebie in the bundle with no set value per se, just a nice little set that's been sitting around, never used to my knowledge and eye.***

First American leather stamped branded portable coffee carafe and two mug set. This is a neat little set, but again just have different stuff. Probably won in a raffle at some point in my family.

I’ve struggled with sleep for 13 years, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve woke up feeling refreshed and not been sleepy during the day. I can get a full 8 hours rest and still nod off while driving, I always pull over but there have been some near misses. I finally got a sleep & nap study done, and everything came back normal, they said I got a great nights sleep according to the data, but I woke up exhausted that day. Also when I fall asleep while driving, I’m immediately dreaming. I’ve also had my dreams start showing up with my eyes open (hallucination) on a particularly tired day, that’s only happened once but it freaks me out. This also affects my work, as I’ll nod off while working at my computer and have to take frequent naps regardless of how much I sleep.

Has anyone else experienced this, and if you have, do you have suggestions on what I should do next? 

Things to know:
-Sleep Study came back normal
-I am Autistic
-Blood and urine tests were normal
-I don’t do any drugs
-I am on a SSRI but have the issue whether or not I’m on it
-I don’t drink coffee or have caffeine

I’m 33, 6’0”, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Seriously, Maine is the most forested state in the U.S., and that’s where I was born and raised. I’m a lean 180 pounds (usually closer to 165, but let’s blame the munchies for the extra padding).

A bit about me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you love a good breakfast. I’ve also got a knack for cooking up a killer breakfast, pancakes, bacon, the works. If you’re into lazy Sunday mornings, I’ve got you covered.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It’s important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there’s mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who’s not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you’re the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we’ll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I’m looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it’s a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let’s make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we can make each other laugh? Or maybe I’ll just have to show you that my breakfast skills are no joke.",0,1732057646.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

Okay, so there’s this girl that works at one of my campus’ chain restaurants at our chain restaurant food court. I think she’s cute and we’ve had a couple of conversations while I’ve waited for my food. I have reason to believe she’s interested in me solely based off of our conversations and how she’s started them before, etc. She’s a year or so older than me and just seems like a really straight up, down to earth, cool person that I could potentially see myself dating. We’ve exchanged names before and whenever I’m getting food from where she works I hope she’s there so I can knock up a convo. I’ve basically developed an innocent crush on her lol

The issue is I’ve only ever seen her while she’s working and wouldn’t want to make her uncomfortable asking for her info while she’s in her work setting. I bumped into her instagram account thru suggestions seeming we have a couple mutual followers and I’m not sure which way to go about asking her to coffee or something. Anyone got any insight or recommendations or anything like that?

I will also not I’ve considered waiting till the end of the semester (before winter break) to ask her in the chance she’s not interested and then maybe it wouldn’t be as awkward anytime I’m ordering food? (Idrk lol)

 after 1.5 months eating this way, I FEEL better than when I first started for sure and can eat 3x the amount of calories without gaining weight but my updated blood work shows my TSH is down to 0.7 and my triglyceride level is now 169 (for a TG/HDL ration of 2.7 from 1.42). my blood coritsol (as reliable as that is or isnt) went down about half which is nice. 



I am still waiting for results on A1C and fasted insulin to really interpret this but my understanding is TG/HDL ratio is pretty solid for metabolic disorders. 

  
to give you an idea of what i am eating -  25% protein, 25% fat and 50% carbs (give or take). 

my protein is from grassfed ground beef, collagen/gelatin, cheeses. 

my  fat source is usually from milk/cheese/grassfed ground beef and occasionally coconut oil/ice cream/chocolate chips. 

my carb source are fruits, OJ, milk, honey, maple syrup in my coffee, occasionally white sugar (in jam or ice cream) or white potato. i did add mexican cokes the last couple weeks so mayb ill lay off that lol. 

  
any insight willl be appreciated.

After a year of working at this place I got extremely tired and fed up with the night shift so i decided to ask the manager to only give me one shift per week, so that i could find a new job. I didnt fully quit because i wanted to have a backup plan in case things did not go well in my new job. I found a new Job at a coffee place. To keep things short, im basically about to get fired from the fast food Job for reasons i dont really want to delve into, and i hate my new Job. Im still not sure what i want to do with my life so i cant really go back to school, but im strongly considering it just so that i can have something to look forward to.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1gvap8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1gvap8b/i_have_an_interview_on_sunday_does_anyone_have/,"I have an Interview on Sunday, Does anyone have any tips?","I'm currently a **freshman in college with no prior job experience**. I applied to a Starbucks about a month ago, and just got a magical text today saying that **I was selected for an interview!** I am worried about getting the position because of my lack of experience, **and I am wondering if anyone has any tips** on how I can make myself more appealing and get the job. 

Also, **what do I wear**, and **should I bring my resume**?? 

It would be great if you could **share previously asked questions**. Here's what I have so far:

  
1. Why do you want to work at Starbucks? 

I go to this Starbucks all the time and I really like the environment that I walk into every time I come into this Starbucks. I enjoy working in fast-paced environments because it allows me to focus better and I love managing multiple tasks in a hands-on environment. I really valued the promo that they are doing right now. Buy a Box, We’ll Give Back: As an extension of Starbucks long record on hunger relief action, this holiday season, Starbucks is inviting customers to join in giving back to donate an estimated 3.5M meals. From November 19, 2024 – January 2, 2025, for each protein box purchase at participating Starbucks stores, Starbucks will give a meal to Feeding America to support hunger relief in your community.

2. Give 1 example of a time you went above and beyond for customer service

While working as a camp counselor with \[ORGANIZATION NAME\] , I encountered a situation where a camper was homesick and struggling to participate. She felt disconnected from the group, which was affecting her experience. I took the initiative to spend extra time with her during breaks, engaging her in conversations about her interests and helping her feel more comfortable. I also found ways to involve her in group activities by assigning her small leadership roles that matched her strengths, like helping with art projects or leading a song. By the end of the session, she was fully engaged. Seeing her transformation reminded me how important it is to listen and adapt to individual needs, even in a group setting.

3. How would you deal with an upset customer? 

Listen and make sure that they feel heard in the situation, and understand what they need. Apologize to them for the mistake, and remake their drink or make sure that they get what they need to be happy and satisfied. Thank them for their patience and give them the new drink, and make sure everything is good before they leave.

4. What do you think it takes to be successful as a barista? 

To be successful as a barista, I believe it’s all about creating a positive experience for the customer through excellent service and building genuine connections. Beyond making great drinks, it’s important to greet customers warmly, remember regulars’ orders or preferences, and take the time to engage with them when possible. Those small moments of connection can turn a routine coffee stop into a highlight of their day. It also takes strong multitasking skills to manage orders during busy periods while keeping the workspace organized and efficient. Teamwork is critical too, as everyone needs to work together to keep things running smoothly. Finally, having a passion for coffee and a willingness to learn ensures that I can bring enthusiasm and quality to every interaction. I enjoy environments where I can combine my love for people with a fast-paced, dynamic setting, which is why I’m excited about this opportunity

5. Tell me about yourself

  
I grew up in San Diego, and I'm currently a freshman at the College of Charleston, majoring in Accounting, where I'm also a member of \[CLUB 1\] and \[CLUB 2\]. Before college, I spent several years as a camp counselor with \[VOULENTEER ORGANIZATION\], while also leading and coordinating meetings for my personal troop. I devoted most of my time into community service, working on multiple projects with organizations like \[ORGANIZATION\], and \[ORGANIZATION\]. I am also passionate about programming and computers in general, as well as spending time at the beach and painting.  I’ve always been passionate about organization and problem-solving, which led me to pursue accounting. Right now, I am looking for job experience to learn about working under pressure, and put my problem solving skills to the test through a fast-paced work environment.

  
I would **love** to hear any critiques or modifications to these answers also.

First time going to London (I'm 42m) from Nashville TN will be there in about a week for about 9-10 days ish, going with a buddy who is a big Everton fan and I wanted to go see them before they moved stadiums as he's offered me to tag along for years now. Decided on staying in London due to more things to do outside the match( not to mention a direct flight ).

Buddy is going to only come in for like 4 days (due to not being about to take off much from work) so will have a lot of time to myself to explore, and I work remote so it's a nice chance to check out things if I end up needing to work a few hours I can pop back to hotel. I also thought it'd be a waste to fly all that way for just 3-4 nights!

Trip is going to be London ( Maida Vale area is first hotel ) for 5 nights ----> Then traveling to Liverpool for one night to watch the match ----> back to london for 3 nights in the regents park area..

1. The trains to Liverpool, do you recommend booking now or is it ok to wait a day or two before? Seems like there is several and multiple times a day.
2. On the train is there plenty of luggage storage if I bring a large suitcase, alternatively it \*seems\* like in London there are tons of places to store luggage for a few bucks should I just take it there and then take a backpack with me to Liverpool for just what I need overnight?
3. I signed up for a 30 day sim card but it has limited data, assuming most coffee shops and places around have easy access to wifi if I see myself trending on burning most of the data?
4. We are planning some things ( IE touristy things ) but if you were a solo traveler esp in walking areas of the places I listed in London any cool places to see?  I imagine being one day in liverpool it won't allow much time to do things there so save that for next time.
5. As far as dress goes I work for Silicon Valley companies as an engineer, here in the states I can pretty much go anywhere in sweatpants ( joggers? ) and hoodie without feeling out of place, I'll bring some jeans and a pair of nicer pants as well, but with it being cold I'd rather be super comfy.. Is that going to make me stick out like a sore thumb? From what I've read even in europe dressing up has relaxed since covid.
6. I've read that everywhere is pretty much cashless now? I'll probably bring $500 in USD or so I assume it's easy enough to exchange over there if I run into issues with getting it out of an ATM? (I've traveled before and got flagged for fraud and it cut off my card so hesitant here to go completely cashless )

I was in the area of one of the best roasters (Nahat coffee) I buy coffee from, and they offer pour over brews, so I decided to try it out.

After deliberating with their barista about the bean choice, I landed on something she recommended, a medium roast Guatemala San Pedro Necta (served in a Fellow caraffe, no less!) which she said has notes of spices and vanilla, which sounded entriguing to me. 

At first, when it was hot, it tasted a bit like generic coffee taste that I'm used to, kind of like traditional turkish coffee (which don't get me wrong, I enjoy). But once it cooled down and I could perceive some of the acidity, it was incredibly unique. It was definitely well extracted and it had some punch, with a real kind of spiced, herbal feel.

I liked the subtelty of filter, as a contrast to espresso. The best part is that I had so much drink to enjoy😅

When I got home I immidiately ordered a generic gooseneck kettle and a generic pour over kit, with a caraffe and brewer. Tbh, brewing espresso was starting to get a bit boring! /s",14,1732057227.0,pourover,3,0.89,False

Oh nothing, just making the bed, making the most of things, making coffee” etc. etc. (with repetition on the word “making”) 

And then it ends on something like “how about you?”

It wasn’t long at all. Maybe a couple of lines…

Thanks!

I’ve always been quite introverted and struggled to make friends but moving to a new place right before a global pandemic didn’t really help that prospect. I thought that becoming a mum would finally help me make some new friends but I’m finding it more difficult and I’m more lonely than ever. 

My little boy was born 7 weeks early so I didn’t get to have any antenatal classes to meet people around the same stage as me prior to birth. We spent our first month in the NICU and then were cautious about too much socialising until he’d had all his jabs, I did make some friends in the NICU but some are still in there and those that aren’t don’t live anywhere near us.

We live in a city with horrible public transport and don’t drive but even still I’ve tried to brave the buses to go to sing along things at our local library but people seem to go with friends and even if I try to chat to people they always seem to rush off at the end so I don’t get a chance to invite them for a coffee or even just properly chat, I can’t exactly abruptly ask someone I don’t know mid nursery rhyme. 

I want to try going to some baby classes but you either have to be able to drive to get to them, hope the buses run on schedule or pay for a whole terms worth at once which I can’t really afford. I’ve tried the peanut to no luck and now I just feel like shit. My husband’s family are lovely but his sister and her kids always take priority so I’m lucky if I see my MIL once a week and then it’s usually only for a few hours until she has to get SILs older son from school but I feel like I can’t demand she spends time with me I’m not her daughter. 

I’m not sure there’s much anyone here can help with but it would be nice to know I’m not the only one. ",4,1732056980.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,5,0.84,False
1gvajg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1gvajg5/overreacting_to_mil_behaviour/,Overreacting to MIL Behaviour?,"Okay, so this is 100% a rant about a MIL(F59) (BFs mom so not married yet). Please delete if not appropriate.

We’ve been together 3 years, have 2 cats and 6 months ago bought our first house together. 

Theres so much to put, but mother-in-law and I have had a very tumultuous relationship for the last three years. When we first got together she was really rude with me to the point his best friend (who is like an adopted son/brother) commented on it. It’s something that my partner has addressed with her and told her to change but she never apologised for to me or explained why to either of us. 

However the breaking point is that this last weekend…my partner and I were due to go on holiday and because it was for a longer period we had asked his younger brother to come round and look after the cats. He’s currently going through a heartbreak and his mental health has been known to be rocky at times. My partner also knows that his mum can be overbearing which frustrates his brother so it was a nice way for him to get away and have a quiet place for himself whilst also doing us a favour. 

MIL gets wind of this and says to partner, why don’t I come round instead and we can do some DIY while your gone (this woman has Pinterest boards for my house and is regularly planning its remodel with my BF. She popped the first bottle of champagne in the house without me when we moved in, planted things in the garden without permission and is generally just acting as though it’s her project house). Cue me telling partner no, not a fan of that, theres no DIY we need done, not entirely comfortable with them doing things to the house while we’re gone anyway because of her previous failure to listen to instructions when we moved in, and not sure I trust she wouldn’t let the cats go outside because shes always asking when they’ll be allowed in the garden / to come and go as they please. so please ask brother to come. We did get into an argument because he wants his mum involved with the house and is concerned that I am retaliating and keeping her at arms length for how shes treated me in the past. Either way we agreed that we’d find ways for this to happen that worked for both of us. 

It seems as though that didn’t go down well with her because she’s proceeded to put the fear of God into brother saying that his allergies will be affected - essentially playing off his anxiety even though he has been at ours with the cats for stays before of up to 2 weeks. Even so if brother doesn’t want to do it that’s fine. The problem now comes in again when on the day with T -5 hours to our flight iMessage brother and ask what food you might like in the fridge he replies while I’m on the phone to partner with- ‘Mum said she’s coming and doing DIY so I don’t need to be there’ cue frantic working out what is happening. Turns out no one felt it necessary to tell us that the plan had changed…I was livid, as was my partner with such little time to find alternatives for cat sitting we had to let her look after the cats. I explained how upset i was with this to my partner because of concerns about cat welfare and feeling like my hand was forced because no one thought to tell us 

either way cue us coming home and finding things in the house had been rearranged, bookshelf, coffee station. She had bought storage organisers with which to rearrange our general meds, paracetamol ect, which live under our coffee station which includes my MH medication ( left visible so i remember to take it in the morning) and my Journal was on the coffee table when it 100% hadn’t been before.

Im trying to work out here if im just being really really overblown and sensitive about something that is just a mum trying to do nice things for her sons? Like, is it bad I’m mad shes rearranged things and bought organisers that I’d never have picked in a million years? Or is my partner fair im thinking and saying that he thinks im resentful for how shes treated me in the past

****EDIT/ADDITION****

She left a note on our weekly planner chalkboard with, Monday- Call mumma, Tuesday- call mumma, weds-make a list/diy list/works and send to mumma with where you want help…etc…

Tldr; MIL came over to house sit by seemingly manipulating a situation and potentially read my journal and rearranged things in my house while I was gone. ",76,1732056950.0,JUSTNOMIL,66,0.95,False

1gvah5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToDurango/comments/1gvah5m/a_community_for_those_who_cant_find_it/,A community for those who can't find it,"I have been living in Durango about a year with my Husband who moved here to take on a captain position in the forest service.  I love the outdoors, and all things Durango - fly fishing, snowboarding, backpacking, hiking, dogs, rafting, paddling, mountain biking, great food, coffee, gardening, permaculture, good beer, arts, yoga, making jewelry, etc.  I even dedicate a lot of my time to making jewelry and gifting it to strangers to uplift the collective vibration.  

However; despite regularly dressing up my puppy in a tutu and saying hi to quite literally anyone that will look my way, I can't seem to make a single friend here.  Or I do, but it goes no where and I never really know why.  I have never struggled so hard to fit in somewhere, where I most definitely fit in.  

Not sure if it's because the locals hate outsiders, but I decided to at least create a community here since I can't seem to be accepted into the local community.  If you feel the same way, I would love to connect, share stories, take the dogs walking, and hopefully we can build a little community of our own.

I can't be the only one who is going through this struggle",1,1732056776.0,NewToDurango,0,1.0,False
