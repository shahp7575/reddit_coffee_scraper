The country songs in this episode were bad for all but I can‚Äôt be the only one who thought that Miss cucu had the best vocals and stage presence out of all. Plus her Miley look was the best one, a great recreation and also a callback to the achievement of rugirls.

I need your help to come up with ideas for how to adapt better this time. I wanted to see what others do to pass the time at night besides movies and TV?

1lg7pbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschoolph/comments/1lg7pbh/unsolicited_advice_on_how_a_relationship_can/,Unsolicited advice on how a relationship can survive med school and residency,"I made this account because let‚Äôs be honest I don‚Äôt want my co-residents or friends knowing I‚Äôm out here giving relationship advice. üòÇ But after surviving med school in the Philippines with my partner, then going through residency and now fellowship (currently in NZ), I wanted to share a few things I‚Äôve learned about relationships, in case it helps someone else.

My husband isn‚Äôt in medicine. He didn‚Äôt study anatomy flashcards with me. He didn‚Äôt do 48-hour shifts. He had no idea what a ‚Äúsurgical prelim‚Äù was for the first six months.

But he‚Äôs been there. Truly. And I wouldn‚Äôt have made it here without him.

I‚Äôm not saying I have all the answers‚Äîthese are just personal lessons I‚Äôve picked up about staying grounded in a relationship while surviving the chaos that is med life.

1. Don‚Äôt Ignore the One Who‚Äôs Choosing You Every Day

I used to say ‚Äúbarkada is life‚Äù in med school. And it was‚Äîuntil it wasn‚Äôt. I barely talk to most of the people I hung out with back then.

But my partner? He stayed. Even though he wasn‚Äôt part of my med world, he showed up in ways that mattered. Stayed up with me during breakdowns. Sent food when I forgot to eat. Talked to me even when I had nothing left to give.

One time during residency, I got really sick body aches, fever, and wiped out. I was helpless. He took care of everything. No friend came close to that kind of care.

That‚Äôs the kind of love that matters. The kind that stays. That chooses you when you‚Äôre at your worst. Don‚Äôt overlook that.

2. Check on Your Partner: It Gets Lonely on Their Side Too

My husband once told me (after the fact) how lonely he got. Nights when he‚Äôd just lie awake, unsure if I even thought about him that day.

It‚Äôs easy to feel like we‚Äôre the only ones drowning. But your partner is also dealing with the silence, the cancellations, the emotional distance.

Check in. Really check in. Not just a ‚ÄúKamusta ka?‚Äù while walking between rotations. Ask how they are. Listen. Let them feel remembered.

Even just a quick ‚ÄúJust finished rounds, hectic af. Hope your day‚Äôs okay‚Äù can mean the world to someone who‚Äôs waiting to feel seen.

3. Be Present Even in the Silence

There were times we‚Äôd eat out and I‚Äôd be glued to my phone group chats, memes, case reviews.

One time, we were in a caf√©. I was studying. He was sipping coffee, just keeping me company. Later that night, he said:

‚ÄúThere were moments I felt like I was in the room, but not the person you wanted to talk to.‚Äù

That hit hard. He didn‚Äôt need 100% of my attention. He just wanted me to be there. Being present doesn‚Äôt always mean talking. It means putting the phone down. Sitting together. Existing side by side.

Even 10 quiet, intentional minutes is better than hours of half-listening.

4. Help Out Even When You‚Äôre Tired

I used to say, ‚ÄúPagod ako,‚Äù like it excused me from helping. And yeah I was exhausted. But so was he. He worked full-time. He cooked. Did laundry. Kept the relationship alive when I didn‚Äôt have the energy to contribute.

Eventually I realized love is in the little things: washing the dishes. Saying ‚ÄúI got this.‚Äù Sending a thoughtful message.

If he hadn‚Äôt done all that, no one else would‚Äôve. And I would‚Äôve been even more alone.

5. You Chose This Relationship Too. So Keep Choosing It

I expected him to just get it. That med school would come first. That he‚Äôd wait. That he‚Äôd be fine always supporting.

And he did. But that wasn‚Äôt fair.

Being grateful that someone stayed isn‚Äôt the same as actually showing up for them.

Relationships don‚Äôt survive on autopilot. Especially when one of you is buried under call slips and duty hours. You chose this person so keep choosing them. With your actions, not just your good intentions.

6. Don‚Äôt Break Yourself for a System That Won‚Äôt Thank You

Moving to New Zealand for fellowship, I realized how different the system can be. There‚Äôs more structure, more respect for boundaries, and wellness isn‚Äôt just a buzzword it‚Äôs legit part of the system.

But no matter where you go, medicine can be thankless. You‚Äôll give it your weekends, your mental health, your everything and the system won‚Äôt care if you burn out.

Back home in the Philippines, burnout is practically worn as a badge of honor. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a warning.

You matter too. You can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup. And when you‚Äôre running on empty, it‚Äôs not the system who‚Äôll be there, it‚Äôs your partner. They‚Äôre the one holding you up while everyone else keeps taking.

Protect that.

7. Don‚Äôt Fall for the Cheating Culture in Med. It Always Ends Horribly

Let‚Äôs talk about something that happens more often than it should: cheating.

I‚Äôve seen it during med school, residency, and even now. People fall into flirtations on duty, confusing stress bonding for emotional connection. A few moments of attention, and suddenly a boundary is crossed.

Every time I‚Äôve seen this happen, it ended in heartbreak. Regret. Guilt. People trade something good, a stable, loving partner‚Äîfor a rush that doesn‚Äôt last.

And when it‚Äôs over, they realize: it wasn‚Äôt worth it. They gave up real love for something that only felt good temporarily.

I get it. Training is hard. It‚Äôs lonely. You want to feel understood, seen, desired. But don‚Äôt confuse adrenaline for love. Don‚Äôt let the chaos of medicine make you forget what you already have.

If you‚Äôve got someone who loves you, who‚Äôs stayed loyal through the worst of it? Be content. Recognize that you‚Äôve found something good and protect it with everything you‚Äôve got.

Looking Back Now, Here's What Actually Got Me Through:

Not the awards. Not the step scores. Not even the big cases.

It was love.
It was support.
It was my family.
It was my partner, who didn‚Äôt always understand what I was going through, but stayed anyway.

So if you‚Äôre in med school, residency, or fellowship, and you‚Äôve got someone outside of medicine who‚Äôs still here, still trying?

Please don‚Äôt take that for granted. Don‚Äôt let them become an afterthought.

Because when the beeper stops buzzing and the coat comes off, it‚Äôs not the system‚Äôs voice you‚Äôll want to hear.

It‚Äôs theirs.",13,1750435324.0,medschoolph,0,1.0,False
1lg7myi,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1lg7myi/losing_weight/,Losing weight,"Hello! 
I'm a 31 female, I've been going the gym for about 2 months now. Maybe a little more, can't remember when I first started. I'm still pretty new but so proud of how much I've done and the weight I lost on my own!

 I've been to the gym before, but this time it was different. Something just clicked and it feels easier to stick with. Even eating is much better then before, before the biggest struggle was portions. Even before I ate healthier but I always ate more then I needed, which didn't change my weight much. 

 Ever since I moved, I've gained about 80ish pounds. This is the heaviest I've ever been my whole life, getting up to about 215 pounds at 5'1. Way overweight for my height. I couldn't believe the amount of weight I've gained, I cried a lot. I couldn't fit any of the clothes I moved here with, I didn't want to get new clothes because shopping made me feel horrible. Everything I liked before didn't fit well on my body anymore. 

 Anyways as I said I've been going to the gym! Pretty constantly too! 4-5 days a week, for about a hour to sometimes even 2 hours (not on purpose) this time I've really been focusing more on form, breathing and just doing this as right as I can, which made me take a little longer. I have a tiny muscle in my arm forming. That to me is insane since I have no upper body strength whatsoever lol. Learned how to use machines I was too nervous to use, now I love them. Watched many videos on certain workouts and new things to try, now I enjoy them and look to try newer things. 

 Some are definitely difficult since i'm still heavier then ever, but I've lost about 22 pounds so far in 2 months! Still doesnt look like I've lost alot, but I definitely feel better about the direction i'm going this time, especially doing this on my own. I really don't know what clicked, I just decided to go back to the gym, everything feels different, like I'm ready and still motivated to keep going. I did have a few days where I felt like I didn't want to go, but even my shitty workouts I left feeling good. Like I did it, even though it wasn't the best. 

 Another thing that changed was drinking water. I even crave it now. This is the most hydrated I've ever been in my life lol. I use to drink lots of coffee and tea in the afternoons. Now I just like coffee and water most days. I love soda. Pepsi, coke, spite and gingerale, but now I just have it when I go out with friends or to the movies. 

Anyways, this is getting long, I love this new journey, even the rough days it's something I look forward too to just focus on. This change is made me a better person, feeling healthier and doing something productive has made me feel better about myself. I still have lots to learn, mostly with food still, eating the same foods does get boring, I just need to learn different meals and snacks to make. Work is just busy so i'm still slacking on the nutrition. I can't wait to see where i'm at later on, I'm just excited, and want to share. If you gotten this far thanks for reading! I don't have many friends here, I've never brought up my weight before, but here it is lol. 

I hope everyone has a good day, and a good workout ü§ç 

Also tips are always appreciated! ",3,1750435186.0,beginnerfitness,2,1.0,False

That is insane, but when this happens it makes me thankful for my friend

This will be hard to believe, but it is the truth. I have been best friends with Anne (fake name ofc) since we were 9 years old. We are both 24 now. Both of our moms are named Sarah. Both of our moms are addicts (mine is an alcoholic of 15+ years, hers is a meth addict who has struggled on/off for a long time). Both of our moms have diagnosed bipolar 2. Both of us have as of this year been diagnosed with it, as well. Our birthdays are two weeks apart. We both experienced a lot of awful things growing up, but finding each other at such a young age made us both feel so much less alone.

I don't know if I believe in soulmates. But if they exist, she is mine. We are not close with our families due to the traumas we experienced. We are each other's family. 

Having someone who understands the nuances of what happens being bp2 has made this journey much more doable. Since being diagnosed a lot of past actions have ""made sense"", but admittingly depression got much worse when realizing if we had actual families who recognize ""hey, my child is sick, they need help"", maybe just maybe certain things would be different. I take responsibility for all of \*my\* actions, but it is hard to not wonder. I hope you all understand that. bp2 did not do those things, I did, and I acknowledge that and am working through it all slowly

I am just rambling a lot, but the thing is, in 2023 I moved 800 miles away from her. I miss her so much and can't believe I did that to be honest. I love where I live, but god I cannot believe it at the same time.

This game is very addicting but almost punishes you in a way if you don‚Äôt play consistent enough, does anyone who can‚Äôt play that often or even play everyday struggle to keep up too? Or is this just a me problem? Of course dedicated players should get cool things but I wish more casual players like me had a chance to as well. Never thought i would be so offended over not getting marble kitchen decor yet here we are (btw TapBlaze if you need another dev or some help hmu I have the basic knowledge üò≠) Not trying to attack or anything just genuinely like please have mercy on me TapBlaze I love your game(s) I just I can‚Äôt keep up with all of this, the Coffee one for now is easier to manage since it‚Äôs still very new but between both idk how I will be in the future at this rate üòÆ‚Äçüí®Sorry I‚Äôm just passionate y‚Äôall this is a really good game",5,1750435115.0,GoodPizzaGreatPizza,0,1.0,False
1lg7lhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontenegroExpats/comments/1lg7lhu/cost_of_living_in_tivat_for_a_couple_in_their/,Cost of Living in Tivat for a Couple in Their Late Twenties: 2025 Overview,"Thinking of moving to Tivat? Here‚Äôs a detailed, up-to-date look at what a couple in their late twenties can expect to spend living in this beautiful coastal town, based on the latest data and real expat experiences.

**Housing Costs**

* Renting a modern one-bedroom apartment in central Tivat typically costs¬†**‚Ç¨400‚Äì‚Ç¨600 per month**.¬†For a bit more space or a prime location, expect to pay on the higher end of that range, especially during the summer when prices can spike.
* Utilities (electricity, water, heating, garbage, etc.) average¬†**‚Ç¨90‚Äì‚Ç¨110 per month**¬†for a standard apartment.¬†If you‚Äôre energy-conscious, you might spend less, but winter heating can bump up the bill.

**Groceries and Food**

* Monthly grocery costs for a couple are usually¬†**‚Ç¨300‚Äì‚Ç¨500**, depending on your eating habits and whether you shop at supermarkets or local markets.
* Local produce, dairy, and meat are high quality and affordable. For example:
   * Bread (loaf):¬†**‚Ç¨0.89**
   * Milk (1 gallon):¬†**‚Ç¨4.79**
   * Eggs (dozen):¬†**‚Ç¨2.63**
   * Chicken breast (1 lb):¬†**‚Ç¨2.79**
* Fresh fruits and vegetables are widely available and inexpensive.
* Eating out is affordable:
   * Meal at a local restaurant:¬†**‚Ç¨11‚Äì‚Ç¨12 per person**
   * Upscale dinner:¬†**‚Ç¨20‚Äì‚Ç¨35 per person**
* Dinner for two at a mid-range restaurant:¬†**‚Ç¨30‚Äì‚Ç¨50**¬†(including drinks).

**Transportation**

* Tivat is compact, so many expats walk or cycle. Taxi fares are reasonable (about¬†**‚Ç¨5‚Äì‚Ç¨6**¬†for a short trip)[4](https://www.mylifeelsewhere.com/cost-of-living/tivat-c9810).
* A monthly public transit pass is around¬†**‚Ç¨33**.
* Gasoline is about¬†**‚Ç¨5.30 per gallon**.

**Internet and Mobile**

* High-speed internet (50 Mbps or faster):¬†**‚Ç¨25‚Äì‚Ç¨35 per month**.
* Many providers bundle internet, TV, and mobile for convenience.

**Lifestyle and Entertainment**

* Gym membership:¬†**‚Ç¨60 per month**¬†on average.
* Movie ticket:¬†**‚Ç¨4.70**
* Coffee at a caf√©:¬†**‚Ç¨2.20**
* Nightlife and social activities are affordable, and Tivat‚Äôs growing expat scene means there are plenty of opportunities to meet like-minded people.

**Other Considerations**

* Clothing and imported goods can be pricey, especially in boutiques. Many expats shop online or during trips abroad for better deals.
* Health insurance and private healthcare are recommended for expats, with costs varying based on coverage.

# Sample Monthly Budget for a Couple

|Expense|Estimated Cost (EUR)|
|:-|:-|
|Rent (1-bed, central)|500|
|Utilities|100|
|Groceries|400|
|Eating Out|120|
|Transport (public/taxi)|60|
|Internet/Mobile|30|
|Gym/Leisure|60|
|Miscellaneous|90|
|**Total**|**1,360 EUR**|

*You can live comfortably for*¬†***‚Ç¨1,300‚Äì‚Ç¨1,600 per month***¬†*as a couple, depending on your lifestyle and housing choices. This is significantly lower than in much of Western Europe, with the added bonus of Tivat‚Äôs stunning scenery and relaxed pace of life.*",1,1750435088.0,MontenegroExpats,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 32 year old woman living in Kent, and I‚Äôm hoping to find some like minded people to connect with. Making friends has always been a challenge for me and honestly I think I might be part of the reason why.

I don‚Äôt have a formal diagnosis, but after my 4 year old son was diagnosed with autism, I started learning more and realised that I‚Äôve likely been masking my whole life without even knowing what autism was. It‚Äôs helped me understand myself a bit better why I‚Äôve always felt a little different or out of place.

That said, I still believe I‚Äôm good friend material! I‚Äôm kind, caring, and friendly although definitely a bit awkward and shy. I do struggle with being consistent in communication and often find socialising draining, so I need time alone to recharge. Oddly enough, I feel most at peace alone but still crave social connection. A confusing combo, I know.

I‚Äôd love to have someone to grab a coffee with, or even go see a film at the cinema. Sadly, I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life right now to do those simple things with.

I‚Äôm still on a journey of figuring out who I really am. I‚Äôve masked for so long that I‚Äôm not entirely sure what my true interests or hobbies are, but I‚Äôm working on that.

A few other things about me:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm more of a morning/daytime person.
	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt drink much, even socially.
	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt smoke or do drugs.
	‚Ä¢	Pubs and clubs aren‚Äôt really my scene 
I‚Äôve been called boring for that more times than I can count.

Anyway, I hope this gives you a small idea of who I am. Maybe something here resonates with you. If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet, thoughtful, slightly weird but warm friend. I‚Äôd love to give it a go and see if we click. üåº",1,1750435025.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

1lg7j12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1lg7j12/dont_give_up/,Don't Give Up.,"I'd been on Bumble for about 4 years, I frequently paused my profile because it gets tedious going through the process of matching, messaging, and then learning another of the 1000 ways it can end. Wondering ""was it something I said?"" or ""How did I miss that red flag?"" LOL. I travel around the world full-time which was a complication as my matches often assumed I was just looking for temporary romance. I really was looking for a serious relationship, ideally another person like me that loves to travel. Many dates, and a few relationships that started out promising but didn't last, left me disillusioned. 

I thought I'd paused my profile for good, but out of boredom one day (I'd just arrived in a new city) I switched it back on and swiped right on a few profiles. I met a lady for coffee and we hit it off, we wound up talking for 8 hours. I was actually just on a visit to her city and living in a different country at the time, but we kept in touch... a lot texts and video calls.

Fast forward and we are now living together, I moved to her city, and we're planning a 3-month long trip together. We both agree that it is somewhat of a Kamikaze-style compatibility test. But we think in the process we'll both have fun at least. It really seems like a needle-in-a-haystack scenario. Wish me luck!

1lg7hlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lg7hlg/my_boyfriend_26m_and_i_23f_struggle_with/,My boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) struggle with communication. He says I lack common sense and we aren‚Äôt on the same communication playing field.,"My boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) have been together for 6 months. He‚Äôs honestly amazing in so many ways- he treats me well, we support each other, and we both see a future together. When we argue, it almost always comes down to communication issues.

One thing he brings up often is that I ‚Äúlack common sense‚Äù and that we don‚Äôt communicate on the same playing field. It‚Äôs becoming a recurring issue.

For example, this morning I used his coffee machine for the first time (I don‚Äôt drink coffee, but I wanted to try making it myself since in the past he‚Äôs gotten upset when I ask for help before trying things on my own). After it was done, it looked watered down, so I asked him if I added too much water. He came over, looked at the machine, and said I used enough beans but added too much water. Then he looked at me like I was dumb and said, ‚ÄúHow do you think it works?‚Äù in a condescending tone.

That frustrated me. It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve felt this way-like he thinks I‚Äôm an idiot for not knowing something. (For context, last week I didn‚Äôt know pizza ovens were flavored and that it affects the crust taste. He‚Äôs really into pizza, I‚Äôm not.) I told him I‚Äôm tired of feeling like he thinks I‚Äôm stupid.

We ended up in an argument because he said I should have communicated better. He believes if I had walked in and said, ‚ÄúHey, this looks watered down, do you think I used too much water or not enough beans?‚Äù then the whole argument could have been avoided. He said I should‚Äôve just asked, ‚ÄúCan you show me how to use the coffee machine?‚Äù But I‚Äôve asked for help in the past and he‚Äôs made me feel dumb, so I tried to figure it out on my own this time and I still ended up feeling stupid.

He also said he‚Äôs frustrated because he feels like he‚Äôs the one who always has to do the ‚Äúthinking‚Äù to fix our arguments. And honestly, I do find myself shutting down when I feel talked down to or overwhelmed, which probably makes things worse.

I‚Äôm really trying to understand where I‚Äôm going wrong here. I don‚Äôt feel like I did anything terrible in this situation, but he‚Äôs clearly frustrated too. Is this just a communication style mismatch, or are we fundamentally incompatible?

TL;DR My boyfriend (26M) says I lack common sense and that we don‚Äôt communicate on the same level. I tried using his coffee machine on my own (to avoid bothering him), but when I asked a follow-up question, he responded in a condescending way. I told him I feel dumb when he talks to me like that, and he said it‚Äôs my fault for not communicating ‚Äúproperly.‚Äù Now he says he‚Äôs tired of doing all the thinking to fix our arguments. I‚Äôm confused and hurt‚Äîare we just miscommunicating, or are we fundamentally incompatible?",2,1750434822.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**  


At just 7-31 on the road, it makes no sense to back the White Sox here, friends. The Blue Jays have won 9 of their last 10 meetings with the White Sox, and 7 of those 9 wins have all been by at least 2 runs. While I don‚Äôt love that Relief Pitcher Spencer Turnbull is getting the start for Toronto (a bullpen game, no doubt) ‚Äì he‚Äôs far from terrible having only allowed 1 run across his last 4 innings pitched. Fresh off a series win over the Diamondbacks, Toronto‚Äôs offense is just far too dialled in; I don‚Äôt think Chicago stands a chance. I‚Äôm on the Blue Jays to cover the RL at home.

1lg7gwa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg7gwa,My honest review of studying at the National Library.,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm a NEET-PG aspirant and have been preparing seriously for over 6 months now. With the exam getting postponed, I was struggling to stay focused while studying at home. That‚Äôs when I decided to try out the National Library.

Let me share my experience with you all in case you‚Äôre also looking for a place to study:

What I Loved About It:
1. The Perfect Study Vibe
The main reading room is absolutely massive‚Äîimagine something as big as two football fields. It‚Äôs well-lit, silent, and filled with aspirants prepping for tough national-level exams. Around 200+ people come to study in the library daily. Everyone is so focused, it kind of rubs off on you. The energy is intense, in the best way.
2. Comfortable and Varied Seating
There are three types of seating:
‚Ä¢ Big 2√óshared tables with cushioned chairs.
‚Ä¢ Private cubicles for solo deep-focus sessions.
‚Ä¢ Individual soft-cushioned sofas if you want to relax while reading.
3. Peaceful Environment
The library is surrounded by beautifully maintained gardens, and walking in through any of its five gates feels like entering a calm, dedicated zone for your brain. You genuinely feel detached from the noise of the outside world.
4. Open All Week
Yes, 7 days a week. That‚Äôs rare and super helpful, especially for people who need to make the most of weekends.
5. Registration Is Hassle-Free
It‚Äôs all online‚Äîjust fill out the form, receive a registration number in your email, and then show up once to get your manual entry card. Smooth and quick.
6. Amenities That Help You Stay Put
‚Ä¢ A small refreshment corner offers tea, coffee, biscuits, and egg toast (DIY).
‚Ä¢ There are clean washrooms‚Äîthis matters more than you think during long study hours.
‚Ä¢ Bag deposit counters are available to safely store your bags.
7. You Can Carry Your Devices
Laptops, tablets, iPads are allowed. So if your study material is mostly in PDFs or offline files, you‚Äôre good to go.

Some Downsides to Keep in Mind:
1. No Printed Books Allowed
Because the library holds rare collections, outside printed material isn‚Äôt allowed. That means you‚Äôll have to rely completely on digital resources or the books in the library itself.
2. Poor Network Connectivity
The biggest struggle‚Äîalmost all mobile networks barely work inside. If your study routine depends on streaming lectures or accessing online question banks/mock tests, you‚Äôll need to pre-download everything. I still haven't figured out how to make the question banks work.
3. WiFi Exists, But‚Ä¶
They do have BSNL WiFi, which is mostly dead and due to the number of people trying to connect, it's mostly unreliable. Only a couple of lucky devices actually get through. The e-resources corner uses the same wifi.
4. The charging points are limited and some people charge their laptop the entire time. If your laptop has a weak battery, you might have to go super early to secure a spot close to a charging point.
4. Food Situation Isn‚Äôt Great
There is a canteen that serves lunch at a very low cost, but both the hygiene and the quality are questionable. Most regulars either bring their own food or settle for the egg toast from the tea stall.

Final Thoughts:
If you‚Äôre someone who needs a disciplined, focused environment to get into deep study mode‚Äîand you don‚Äôt mind pre-downloading your content or packing lunch‚Äîthe National Library is a good option. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs one of the few places in the city that really helps you feel like studying. 
Hope this helps someone out there trying to find their own ideal study spot. Good luck to all of us preparing.",25,1750434774.0,kolkata,0,1.0,False

So if anyone who raises them ( that has experience first hand) please chime in! 
I'm new with breeding them. After quite some time reading/ researching i finally got the chance to be hands on! 
So here's where i need help with because i can not find anywhere if this is normal or not...
Last night one of my worms wandered away from the food and onto soil. ( I set it up the bin is about 6 inches of soil and plopped a few lids on top of it where i place the food and some gutter guard for climbing) (Been deligently cleaning their fecal matter multiple times a day and the container is very well ventilated) Anyways i figured he might be getting ready to pupate. This am i find him and i thought he was gone... I sadly pick him up to find him quite firm ( not moving) but then i felt his little grippy feet! I put him back gently figuring hes either dying or ready to pupate... Some time passes and i check again and i see alot of brown formation!! ( There was no "" brown"" before coffee...( I don't believe i saw the pulsating black line prior) And i do not believe this "" browning"" is that but i believe this is the beginning of pupating. He is alive but why has he not burrowed if this is indeed the stage of transforming into pupae?! I could also be entirely wrong with what information is circulating in my head. Am i right that this is surface level pupating? Or is this completely something else that I'm not aware of. I really want to get this right. So any feedback is appreciated. This is my very first hands on experience amd definetly a learning curve. ( They are being fed the hornworm chow from i believe oregon silkworms) ",1,1750434611.0,caterpillars,1,1.0,False

1lg7c7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1lg7c7f/there_are_no_changes_to_the_sub_but/,"There are no changes to the sub, but...","Greetings and salutations! You have found the sticky spot on the internet where unrepentant alcoholics can come for people like themselves to talk to. It's like a backwards assed AA meeting with no coffee or preachy bullshit. Just the Damned, the Fucked Off, the Cirrhosis Speedrunners and the ones at peace with this addiction to be themselves. It's a club nobody wants to join but is sometimes the only fucking place left to be honest about what The Suck is like. To all of you, I tip my hat and hold the door for you.

 Unfortunately, a large percentage of those who come and post here don't fit that description. Drunk kids, weekend warriors, lightweight drinkers who think a 12 pack of seltzers a day mean you need a liver transplant, fucking college drama majors channeling Bukowski or Hunter S. Thompson, even actual larpers roll up in here on the daily. To all that fit these descriptions, I say Fuck Off. [r/drunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/drunk) exists. Go find your kind in there. Yall fuck up the signal to noise ratio in here.

 I have been here long enough to see the same 10 posts repeated with genuine truth and honesty hundreds of times. This place aint Drunkapedia. We aren't therapists, relationship counselors, doctors, lawyers or probation officers. We don't have the answer for your DUI charge, mudbutt, new STD, texting problem, pissed off boss or parents. This is not the place for any of that shit. The dumbest fucking thing you could do is ask us how to unfuck your problems. If we were good at any of that, We Wouldn't Be Crippled Alcoholics. 

 So, you ask. Well Kent, what am I supposed to do? Yall sound like you get fucked up. I get fucked up too! I belong, you oldass, gatekeeping hater! Well, it's not like there's some wasted mickey mouse statue at the door saying you must be this tall to ride. I'll give you a hint. Hell, I'll give you the fuckin answer. Go Read The Goddamn Sidebar Before You Post One Fucking Thing and see if perhaps, you aren't the very first human with a keyboard to have this problem. There is wisdom, actual magic tricks, warnings written in puke and blood over there. Or dont. Just keep acting like this is a shitty cable intervention show and you're the star. This is a club nobody wants to be in. It ends with pain, loss, mental illness and death. I can name at least ten real, smart, intelligent people I knew personally who are dead as Elvis from this sub. Maybe you belong here. If so, shit sucks, huh? Welcome home anyway. If you don't, Lurk and recognize we aren't cartoons, high scores to beat, and nobody you want to become.

 My name is Kent and this shit aint killed me.

1lg7abc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1lg7abc/how_to_live_in_harmony/,How to live in harmony?,"True harmony isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about balance. It‚Äôs waking up each day with a sense of purpose, navigating challenges with resilience, and cultivating relationships that nourish your soul. Whether you seek inner peace, better connections, or a more balanced lifestyle, these science-backed principles will guide you toward a harmonious life.

https://preview.redd.it/00mj1n2o608f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eb888c6d8566bda013d95a2c28af435f7758672



1. The 80% Rule: Embrace ""Good Enough""

Principio: Striving for excellence is admirable, but perfectionism breeds stress.



Japanese chef Jiro Ono, owner of a Michelin-starred sushi restaurant, teaches his apprentices that mastery comes from consistent effort‚Äînot flawless execution. A University of British Columbia study found that people who embrace the ""good enough"" mindset experience 30% less anxiety while maintaining high performance.



How to apply it:

\- Set realistic standards for yourself.

\- Celebrate progress, not just perfection.



2. The Rhythm of Rest: Sync with Your Body‚Äôs Natural Cycles

Principio: Your energy fluctuates‚Äîwork with it, not against it.



Renowned composer Ludwig van Beethoven took long walks in nature to spark creativity, aligning his work with his natural rhythms. Modern research from the University of California confirms that syncing tasks with your circadian rhythm boosts productivity by 20%.



How to apply it:

\- Schedule demanding tasks during peak energy hours.

\- Take short breaks every 90 minutes to recharge.



3. The ""Two-Minute"" Connection Rule

Principio: Small, consistent gestures strengthen relationships more than grand gestures.



The indigenous Maori people of New Zealand practice ""whakawhanaungatanga""‚Äîbuilding connections through daily, meaningful interactions. A Harvard Study spanning 85 years found that people who nurture relationships with brief but frequent check-ins report higher life satisfaction.



How to apply it:

\- Send a quick message to a loved one daily.

\- Practice active listening‚Äîeven for just two minutes.



4. The Art of Letting Go: The 10-10-10 Rule

Principio: Ask: Will this matter in 10 days, 10 months, or 10 years?



Philosopher Epictetus, born into slavery, taught that inner peace comes from focusing only on what we control. Neuroscience supports this: Journal of Positive Psychology studies show that people who practice detachment from minor stressors have lower cortisol levels.



How to apply it:

\- Pause before reacting‚Äîask the 10-10-10 question.

\- Release grudges; they weigh you down more than others.



5. The ""Silent Morning"" Ritual

Principio: Start your day with stillness, not stimulation.



Author Haruki Murakami begins each morning with meditation and coffee‚Äîno phone, no noise. Research from King‚Äôs College London reveals that just 12 minutes of morning silence enhances mental clarity for the entire day.



How to apply it:

\- Delay checking emails/social media for the first hour.

\- Try deep breathing, journaling, or a quiet walk.



6. The Harmony Equation: Give + Receive = Balance

Principio: A harmonious life requires both contribution and self-care.



Humanitarian Fred Rogers (of Mister Rogers‚Äô Neighborhood) dedicated his life to serving others but also prioritized solitude to recharge. A Stanford study found that people who balance giving (helping others) with receiving (self-compassion) experience 40% less burnout.



How to apply it:

\- Volunteer or help someone weekly‚Äîbut also schedule ""me time.""

\- Say no when needed; boundaries foster harmony.



The Path to Harmony Starts Today

Harmony isn‚Äôt a distant dream‚Äîit‚Äôs built through daily choices. Like a symphony, life requires different notes: effort and rest, connection and solitude, ambition and acceptance.



Your next step? Pick one principle to practice this week. Small shifts create lasting change.



""Peace is not the absence of chaos, but the ability to be calm within it."" ‚Äî Unknown

20f and a family of 5, plus my mom and grandma. Right now, I‚Äôm the only one with a car and it‚Äôs basically used as the house car but I don‚Äôt want that! My 20yo little brother, has crashed every other car we ever had, so I don‚Äôt trust him to drive on top of the fact that he‚Äôs a hot head who thinks everyone is ‚Äújanky‚Äù. My 22yo brother, doesn‚Äôt have a license or a permit. My 25 yo brother doesn‚Äôt either, and my 28yo sister doesn‚Äôt either. Only me and my younger brother do, his needs to be renewed. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my siblings aren‚Äôt slobs, it‚Äôs just that since our mom is basically disabled and not able to work, we all have to take care of the house and bills. My mom feels like a burden, which in my option I would say she 70% isn‚Äôt and 30% is. None of us can move on and prosper because of us being stuck in the cycle of taking care of each other; but I love my mom dearly.

Anyways, my siblings struggle with getting a car because at one point in time, my oldest two siblings were the only ones working and paying for everything and having everything in their name, consequently lowering their credit sometimes. Out of 5 of us only 3 of us work, it‚Äôs about to be 4 of us once my 25yo brother gets his first check next week. I genuinely feel bad for him, because he kind of gets sad easily when he feels like a burden or liability and it can cause him to become quiet or drink. Drinking is what got him fired from his last 4 jobs putting him out of work for like 2 years total. 

But I get defensive about my car because IM THE ONE paying $650 a month for it and ITS NOT EVEN NEW. I‚Äôm gonna be paying for it for 6 years and I just want my car to not be ran thru and having possible problems after my Warranty ends and my car is paid off. Plus, I kind of have trauma from when I was 16 and got my first car, and my little brother slowly started taking over it until he literally called it his car and it became his. Long story short, he was the one driving everyone to work;  then there was an incident where he thought people started recognizing the car and that it was no longer safe for me to drive and it took over the car. So now, when I see someone(my mom) grab my keys. Or my little brother ask for the keys late at night to go get shells from the store, I react rudely and irritated; but I can never say no. Sometimes my siblings won‚Äôt even ask me if they can go somewhere, they will just ask my mom if she can take them, and then she comes in my room saying ‚Äú I‚Äôm about to take ****** to the coffee shop‚Äù 

I guess it just feels like I don‚Äôt have any control over it. Plus, I‚Äôm tired of this family cycle of struggle, I actually kind of want to leave but I can‚Äôt do my siblings like that. I love them, and they didn‚Äôt ask to be in this situation either.",3,1750434141.0,AmItheAsshole,23,0.67,False

I‚Äôve been collecting handmade pottery for years, and my latest rabbit hole is Tamegroute‚Äîa tiny village in southern Morocco that fires clay into that deep emerald glaze you‚Äôve probably scrolled past on IG. After testing a few pieces around my place, I figured I‚Äôd drop a quick guide for anyone hunting statement candle holders with actual heritage behind them.

|Piece|Why It‚Äôs Cool|Best Spot|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**1. Green Candlestick Trio**|Classic Tamegroute gloss + subtle black veining. Three heights = easy layered vignette.|Mantel, dining table|
|**2. Ceramic Candle (Green + Sahara Ochre)**|Soy wax, refillable jar, two scent options (orange blossom = chef‚Äôs kiss).|Nightstand, bath tray|
|**3. Wooden Tripod Outdoor Holder**|Cedar legs + iron bowl. Folds flat. Throws dramatic X-shadows at night.|Patio, garden path|
|**4. Stacked Pillar Holders (Set of 3)**|Ribbed column vibe; looks sculptural even when empty.|Console table, bookshelf|
|**5. Triple-Wick Bowl Candle**|Footed square bowl, crackling wooden wicks. Turns into a salt cellar when empty.|Coffee table, spa bathroom|

*(All five are from* ***Marrakeche Crafts****‚Äîdirect links at the bottom so I‚Äôm not spamming the body.)*

# Quick Buying Tips

* **Check the base.** Raw clay bottoms can leave heat marks; stick a cork coaster under if you‚Äôve got delicate surfaces.
* **Glaze ‚â† paint.** A thicker glaze means deeper color *and* fewer soot stains‚ÄîTamegroute pieces are literally dunked twice.
* **Trim your wicks.** ¬º in. keeps the flame low and the vessel clean.
* **Reuse > toss.** Once the wax is done, hot-water rinse + dish soap = planter, pen cup, whatever.

# Styling Ideas

1. **Clustered Heights** ‚Äì Place the candlestick trio on one side of a shelf, balance with a stack of books on the other. Instant symmetry.
2. **Mixed Textures** ‚Äì Pair the glossy green with matte terracotta pots or hammered brass. Contrast makes the glaze pop.
3. **Outdoor Runway** ‚Äì Line two or three tripods along a pathway for a mini-Marrakesh riad vibe.
4. **Seasonal Swap** ‚Äì Fill the empty bowl candle with dried citrus in summer or cinnamon sticks in winter. Smells good even unlit.

1lg76gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1lg76gl/is_this_normal_practice_pain_3_weeks_after/,Is this normal practice? (Pain 3 weeks after fillings),"I‚Äôm in recovery. I got sober nearly 5 years ago and finally started to catch up on my healthcare. I went to a dentists office a couple years ago (after maybe 17 years?) - they did x-rays and a partial deep clean and scheduled me for a filling. 

They called the next day to say ‚Äúoops, we actually *don‚Äôt* accept your insurance, you can still come in and pay out of pocket.‚Äù So I went elsewhere. 

That dentist requested the x-rays from the other office and they never sent them. So they did the filling required without the x-rays and I had no issue. But then that office closed‚Ä¶

So I upped my insurance plan and went back to the original office because, despite the front office mix up, the dentist was nice and I didn‚Äôt know any better... 

It‚Äôd been 2 years since the original visit. They performed the other half of the deep clean and the dentist wanted to see me back every 4 months. But they couldn‚Äôt schedule me until 6 months later. 

So I go in for a cleaning and the hygienist (or whatever the term is) knocked out the filling I just had done at the other office (the one that closed). The dentist didn‚Äôt ask but rather *told* me that the filling was loose. 

I couldn‚Äôt get back until the 29 of May, just this past month. Here‚Äôs where I get really upset -

Let me preface by saying at this point my teeth and gums are very healthy and I actively brush and floss multiple times per day. I had a little pain when the filling was first knocked loose but after a day or two, no pain at all. Zero. 

I assumed they were just replacing the filling that got knocked out. I got numbed in 2 places and the dentist is telling her assistant that she‚Äôs going to do ‚Äú13 and 14‚Äù - I‚Äôm aware of a cavity along the side of one of my teeth, close to the gum line, I‚Äôm constantly flossing there and pull chunks of food out - but they haven‚Äôt done x-rays since that original batch which has now been 2 1/2 if not 3 years ago. 

The dentist does a lot of drilling, doesn‚Äôt tell me much about what she‚Äôs doing and then leaves her assistant to do the filling. 

The assistant, from the second he walked in the room was talking about how tired he was and constantly yawning throughout the procedure. 

He was very thorough, or so I thought, I was very numb so I had no idea, the dentists came a looked it over briefly when he was done, said ‚Äúone of them was deep so you might have pain for a couple days‚Äù and it was on to the next patient. 

My mouth hurt after a couples days. And then a couple more. And a couple more‚Ä¶ and not just my mouth - my eye socket, my ear canal, my jaw - I can‚Äôt drink anything hot or cold without radiating pain, I can‚Äôt chew on that side of my mouth and it‚Äôs been THREE WEEKS. Again, I had NO PAIN before these fillings. 

I called the office to schedule at appointment to have it looked at. I told the receptionist that I do shift work and I can‚Äôt leave work for an appointment so we‚Äôd have to work around my schedule and she LITERALLY SCOFFED AT ME. 

Then when I brought up how ‚Äúthe hygienist who did my fillings was so tired‚Äù she said ‚Äúhygienists don‚Äôt do fillings.‚Äù And I felt so stupid in that moment, I said ‚Äúthe dentists did the drilling and there was another person-‚Äú 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a hygienist‚Äù

‚ÄúOk well-‚Äú

‚ÄúIt might have been an assistant‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god that‚Äôs so not the point, I have pain radiating ever-‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just letting you know. It wasn‚Äôt a hygienist‚Äù

I got off the phone in tears. I‚Äôm sorry I suffered ongoing childhood trauma for 17 years until my father died in 2003, and my mother couldn‚Äôt be bothered to teach me anything and the kids bullied me so badly in school that when alcohol released all of my inhibitions and allowed me to feel like a normal person *finally* I chased that feeling for the next 15 years because I didn‚Äôt know how live or how to heal‚Ä¶.

Does this make me unworthy of care? Because that‚Äôs how I was left feeling after this procedure and now I have pain. Daily. Throughout the entire left side of my skull. 

I‚Äôm going to seek care elsewhere, I‚Äôve gotten some recommendations I just want to know if I truly am stupid or if this is not common practice. 

Thanks. NAD.

Thank you for all the helpful comments (bonus points to those who pointed out the nice things in the room as well, that was helpful for my self esteem lol). I have some more info and a bookshelf update.

- I should have also mentioned I like boho and MCM style. The green dream DIY is my favourite design blogger. 
- I've been debating painting the room either a whiter white with a dark green accent wall OR like a sage green all over, thoughts?
- We plan to renovate the kitchen and basement in the next few years and that will impact this room (more space for stuff to spread out, eg. big couch could move downstairs) so I'm aiming for inexpensive or reusable fixes at this point. 
- We definitely need a new media unit, that's been on the list when we have the money, probably walnut?
- coffee table stays. I know, I know round is better, I knew when I bought it, but it's a lift top and we eat at the tv most nights (don't @ me) and play big board games on it
- couch is lined up with the tv

I also wanted to post some photos of the room a year ago in case anyone had ideas of what to pull from there (since it's stuff I own already). It's a bit more minimal but the floating shelves weren't quite working for me and couldn't figure out why, so I tried the gallery wall. 

I want some shelves but agree the bookshelf is too crowded. I've done a reorg (last photo) and think it looks at least a little better! ",4,1750434020.0,DesignMyRoom,10,1.0,False

Not the movie kind of falling. Not the loud, grand, fireworks and b dramatic kiss kind. No..this was quieter. Like a sigh at the end of a long day. Like finally being able to breathe after holding it in for too long.
It was in the way your eyes softened when you looked at me. In how your laughter found all the hollow places in me and filled them. In how you never asked me to shrink,how you saw every part of me and stayed anyway.

What we had didn‚Äôt burn fast and bright. It glowed. Steady. Warm. Like a home I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd been searching for my whole life.
And I know what we had was real because I still feel you everywhere. In songs you used to hum. In coffee shops where we lost track of time. In the silence where your voice used to be.

You weren‚Äôt just love..you were recognition.
As if every version of me, across every lifetime, knew how to find you.

And I did.

But the cruel thing about soulmates is that sometimes the world isn‚Äôt ready for them. Timing betrays them. Life tangles them in separate directions. And so here I am, loving you in quiet places you‚Äôll never hear.
Still carrying you in a thousand unsent letters.
Still hoping you feel me when the wind brushes your cheek a little too gently, or when a stranger says something only I used to say.

You were my once in a lifetime.
And I‚Äôll spend every lifetime loving you, even if I never get to again.

Always yours,
Even in silence.

1lg72sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1lg72sm/i_was_there/,I was there,"I met him on bumble last july 2024. he was a trainee that time, graduating sa college. I was an intern sa isang vet clinic. kinupkop siya ng tita niya from his parents on bicol kasi baka daw maging tambay lang siya doon. pinakita niya agad sa akin yung vulnerable side niya nung nagsisimula pa lang kaming mag usap. he told me about his papa, and that he is his papa's boy. kinwento nya rin sa akin na ang baon niya nung jhs and shs was only 30 pesos, and yung 7 pesos pa doon is for his one-way fare, meaning 23 na lang ang matitira sa kanya. may sahod siya sa ojt, but it was barely enough for 30 days, hindi na rin kasi siya binibigyan ng tita niya ng baon that time. first week ng pag uusap namin, bigla niya sinabi sa akin na ""pautang nga 150"". syempre nagulat ako, almost called it off kasi the way he told me that was not so polite. pero life must be really tough sometimes kaya hindi ko siya jinudge, although hindi ko rin naman siya pinahiram. parang thrice nangyari during his ojt na nag attempt siya humiram sa akin ng money pero once ko lang siya napahiraman. It was the time na sinabi nya sa akin na wala na talaga siyang pera na pang baon, and that hihingi na lang siya ng ulam sa mga kasama niya, halos maiyak ako nun. pinahiram ko siya, small amount lang din kasi it was from my allowance lang. then one time naospital yung tita niya and his cousin needs load, sa akin ulit siya humiram. after his ojt, manuscript naman niya yung pinagtulungan namin na ayusin. I am so happy when he finally graduated, his papa must be so proud of him in heaven. nag stop kami mag usap for a week around november last year, then on a random afternoon, may unknown number na tumawag sa bago kong phone number, alam kong siya yun kasi siya palang nakakaalam sa number ko na yun. pero hindi ko sinagot. tumawag ulit siya, sinagot ko na. sinabi niya sa akin na may isa nang nag update sa mga pinag applyan nya and hindi siya natanggap kasi yung mas may experience and kinuha. I asked him if napanghihinaan na ba siya ng loob, he said yes. I comforted him and never left his side again until december 3. we stopped talking again dahil sa inconsistencies niya na hindi niya kayang ayusin, and hindi ko kayang isabay at problemahin during my finals week. it took him 3 weeks to message me again. binati nya ako kasi birthday ko. small talks, kamustahan, ""may work na ako"". I congratulate him and told him deserve niya yun. I am beyond proud of that man. january came and nagkita na kami kasi bumalik na ako sa clinic. january 6 was both our first days. first day ko ulit sa clinic, first day nya sa job. dumaan sya sa clinic after ng duty nya around 9 pm. sa limang beses na pagkikita namin during my one month stay, ito yung pinaka masaya para sa akin. nasa labas lang kami ng clinic, catching up, nagtatawanan. nag pplay yung hands down by dashboard confessional sa isip ko habang magkausap kami kasi pure happiness lang talaga nararamdaman ko. tuesday yung RD ko sa clinic before, pero pinalipat ko ng saturday last january kasi yun din yung day off nya. first date namin was when nagpasama sya sakin bumili ng black shoes then derecho kami sa tapsihan na palagi nyang kinukwento sa akin during his ojt days, matagal ko na kasi na request sakanya na dalhin ako don and he did. kkb kami, walang problema sa akin. the next dates, hindi na nya ako pinaglabas ng pera. 6am-4 pm duty nya, 9am-6pm naman sa akin. one time inantay nya ako sa labas ng clinic kasi may binalik sya sa workplace nya. OT pa ako nun kasi ang dami pang tests na ginawa sa last patient. nagpasama lang ako sakanya kasi magwiwithdraw ako ng pera then we ended up eating sa labas ng 7/11 after ko mag grocery sa puregold. god, palagi kaming sa corner seats umuupo. ang tahimik ng paligid kahit ang daming sasakyan kasi katabi lang ng crossing yung 7/11, or baka yung isip ko lang yung tahimik that time, kasi sya yung katabi ko. nung gabi rin na yun yung first time nya nagsabi sa akin ng thank you. ""ang ganda talaga ng love story nila aoi at sakamoto, may isang tao talagang maniniwala sayo. thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"".

ang pinakanakakakaba na nagawa ko with him was when we went to antipolo cathedral. sa eastwood lang talaga ang paalam ko kila doc that time, and ang plan kasi e sasabay ako sa kanila umuwi, kasi dadaan din sila sa eastwood sa gabi. inask nya ako if gusto ko ba na sa antipolo cathedral kami pumunta, para kahit hindi man daw nya maipaexperience sa akin yung city lights na bukambibig ko rin sa kanya during our early days of talking, at least madala manlang nya ako sa antipolo, sa simbahan. ang saya saya ng puso ko nun beb. kung alam mo lang..

the night before ako umuwi sa province namin, inaya niya pa ako mag coffee. desidido akong pumunta at makita sya non kasi uuwi na ako kinabukasan kasi mag start na rin sem namin, and who knows kelan ulit kami magkikita diba. 8 pm na hindi pa rin ako nakakapagpaalam kila doc if pwede pa akong lumabas, may dinner pa kasi kami sa clinic. nahihiya na talaga ako na magpaalam kasi late na rin, pinayagan naman ako ni doc. we went to sb sa podium mall, pinakilala nya ako sa kaibigan nya. after that naglakad kami. saksi ang ortigas ave kung gaano ko kagusto na hindi na matapos yung gabi na yun. buti na lang pala at hinarap ko yung takot kong magpaalam kay doc nung gabi na yun. buti na lang pumunta ako. buti na lang sumipot ako. kasi yun na pala yung huling beses na magkikita tayo. 

makakabalik pa ako sa pasig, makakadaan ka pa sa clinic, makakabili pa ako ng big bite at smart C sa 7/11 sa tapat ng tricity, mapupuntahan ko pa yung sm east, tapos derecho kain ng tapsi, makakadalaw pa ako sa antipolo cathedral, balak ko pa nga na mag review sa starbucks podium even once kapag nag rereview na ako sa board exam next year, pero hindi na tayo makakabalik sa isat isa

kasi isang buwan lang pala yung kailangan mo para makalimutan mong mahal mo ako. kakayanin mo na pala na matulog nalang akong masama ang loob sayo kesa ayusin natin yung problema. yung assurance na dapat kusa mong binibigay sa akin, kailangan ko na rin hingin. lagi na rin akong may kaba at duda kasi ilan ba sa mga pinagdudahan ko sa ig mo yung hindi mo kinausap diba? hindi biglaan yung pag bitaw mo sa akin e, kasi gradual mo pang pinaramdam sa akin na hindi mo na ako kailangan. inunti unti mo pa ako. kaya mo na akong murahin. kaya mo na akong i-mute sa messenger. kaya mo na akong sigawan kapag sasagutin mo yung tawag ko. kaya mo nang hindi magsabi sa akin ng totoo kapag nasa inuman ka. kaya mo na ring i set aside yung nararamdaman ko kapag nagsasabi ako ng kinabobother ko. ang hirap hirap magsalita every time may inoopen up ako at sinasabi mo sa akin na pagod ka, na ako nag aaral lang, pero ikaw nagtatrabaho na at nasa real world. kaya mo nang tawanan na lang yung mga matters na inoopen ko. ilang beses kitang tinanong kung may iba ba, ang sabi mo lang sa akin kahit naman sabihin mong may iba, hindi pa rin ako lalayo sayo. pero hindi mo pa rin sinabi sa akin na may iba pala talaga. pinanood mo lang akong mahirapan na ifigure out ka for two months.

nalaman ko na lang na friend na pala ulit kayo ng ex mo sa fb kasi nagrereact ka na ulit sa posts nya. nung time pala na nagmamakaawa ako sayo na sagutin yung tawag ko kasi gusto ko nang pumasok sa bahay dahil umiiyak na ako sa labas, ginagawa mo na pala yung mga kinakatakot ko. sabi mo sa akin nung dumalaw ka kay mama mo sa cavite, sinabihan ka na dapat pagbalik mo dun may dala ka nang babae. hindi pala yung pinakilala mo na doktor mo ang dadalhin mo. kaya pala sinasabi mo sa akin na hindi ka na masaya, na ayaw mo nang mag stay ako. kaya pala hindi ka takot mawalan, kasi may nakaready na pala. kapangalan pa ng ex mo. hindi mo na pala ako kailangan, kasi nakahanap ka pala ng mas malapit sayo.
 

you mean so much to me. hindi ka iba sa akin. i removed the walls i built high for years because it was you. hindi ko naman kasi inexpect na kapag lumawak na pala yung mundo mo, tatalikuran mo lang din pala ako.",1,1750433832.0,CasualPH,0,0.6,False

bb - bed and breakfast?

2. AI is going to analyze the pdf and ask some questions about it
3. Takes in a recording from a meeting and AI is going to read the transcript of it and analyze
4. Populates an updated version of the document with all the chnages that are fetched from the meeting recording.

The prototype I built only does a part of the features that I described above but the workflow above is what I think that could help you guys a lot and I would like honest opinions about it. (Please be brutal and straight up, I am ready for it!!)

Then came the work trip.

He brought you along, though he barely looked your way. Meetings, phone calls, late nights at the office‚Äîhe left you alone more than with him. I noticed the frustration in your eyes‚Ä¶ the loneliness.

At first, we barely spoke. Then came the small talk over coffee, shared glances in the elevator, and conversations that went deeper than they should have. You asked me things‚Äînot just about the project, but about¬†*me*. You said he doesn‚Äôt listen anymore, doesn‚Äôt see you.

That night at the hotel bar, he cancelled dinner again. You sat beside me instead. We drank. Talked. Laughed. And when your hand brushed against mine, neither of us pulled away.

Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it was inevitable.

All I know is, I‚Äôve spent years being unnoticed‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôve spent years being unloved.

This trip might change everything‚Äîfor both of us.

\*\*\*

Before I begin, I'd like to share a bit about who we are as travellers, because I think travel is such a personal endeavour and what might make it fun for someone would turn another right off.

My wife and I decided a year ago that we would mark our 15th anniversary with a family vacation to Italy, a country that we've always wanted to visit. We had put off flying for more than six hours in the past few years as we were unsure how our youngest would handle a lengthy flight, but we felt that at the ripe old age of six, it was time to try.

As it happened, we really need not have worried as he handled the 12-hour flight like a champ! The two older kids (11F, 13F) also managed the flight easily... the wonders of youth!

**Milan (Day 1 - 2)**

We landed in the early morning in Milan and opted to check in to the Crowne Plaza Milan (Malpensa) so we could get some sleep and freshen up before heading into the city and checking into our Airbnb.

After checking out of the hotel, we decided to take the train from the airport as we found the cost of taxis prohibitive. The trains were great - clean, comfortable and safe. We got to Milan Centrale in good time and marvelled at the grandeur of the station.

We stayed for two days in the neighbourhood of Brera, which was a lovely introduction to Milan. It was somehow both quiet and buzzing in the way the best neighbourhoods are, with cafes and little retail shops around every corner, yet without the crowds we would encounter just a few streets away in the Duomo.

Some of the places we visited in Milan included: Duomo, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, Parco Sempione. We had our first gelatos of the trip at Vero Gelateria (I think these were the best ones we had the entire trip) and enjoyed our first aperitivos at one of the prosciutteria in Brera (how had I never tried an Aperol Spritz in my 42 years?). The kids had fun chasing the pigeons around in the main plaza, and stuffing their faces with all the pizza and pasta they could find.

I think Milan makes a good landing point for an Italy trip with kids, especially if you are a city dweller. There is enough of the familiar mixed with the new that gently eases you into the rhythms of Italian life. I also found myself thinking ""*I could live here!""* more than I did in the other cities/towns we visited later in the trip.

**Bologna (Day 3 - 5)**

Transit from Milan-Bologna via the FR trains were once again a very good experience. We opted for the premium cabin because we booked the tickets a few months in advance and the price difference was not much then. The family promotion meant that we only effectively paid full fare for the two adults while the children rode for free - something we would come to really appreciate about Italy (children up to 16 are usually free or heavily discounted when it comes to transport or entry to museums/attractions).

We found the city of Bologna to be rather different from Milan. The place felt grittier, with graffiti on every inch of free wall, but the people were generally younger, and with fewer tourists than in any other city we visited.

When reading up about Bologna online, it is impossible to miss the fact that it is regarded by many as the food capital of Italy - where Italians themselves go to eat. Together with nearby towns Modena and Parma, this was a place that gave the world Bolognese pasta and lasagne, dishes that can be found around the world.

I particularly enjoyed the Tigella - flatbreads that are stuffed with both sweet and savoury fillings of ham, cheese, chocolate, etc. I regret not bringing a dozen back home... craving some really badly now! I suppose I will just have to learn how to make some :)

We took the tram up to San Luca, which gave us amazing views of the city. I had originally planned on walking up to the church via the 666 porticos after reading about it online, but as the tram wound its way up the steep slopes, I gave a prayer of thanks that I had given in to my very human dislike of steps and sweat. 

The Quadrilatero was a nice way to spend a few hours wandering and sampling cheese, fruit and cured meats. I especially liked the strawberries and melons which were in season. The cured meats were also delicious, and we ended up picking different shavings of meat and cheese to create our own platters for breakfast every morning. 

The porticos (sheltered walkways) were a great representation of the city - functional yet beautiful in its own way. I suppose they won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it was my second favourite city on my trip. 

We managed to squeeze in a day trip to Parma, and it was a lovely, unhurried city that was very walkable. We visited the museums in the Pilotta Palace which were very good indeed. I was surprised to find entire sections on the Egyptians alongside beautiful sculptures and stories of how Parma came to be. 

We also spent a couple of hours at the Parco Ducale which is a French-style public park that was quiet except for a few groups laying in the grass enjoying the sun. Later that afternoon, I visited my first Bialetti shop and fell in love with the moka pot. (I am writing this as I sip coffee from my new moka pot!)

All in all, Parma was a good change of pace and a reminder that slowing down is such an underrated part of a good holiday. 

**Florence (Days 6 - 11)** 

I was perhaps most excited to visit Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance. Much of what I had read of the Medicis fascinated me, and I had always loved the idea of a place where the arts and sciences were equally valued. 

After visiting the city, I will say that Florence's reputation as an arts and heritage capital is well-deserved. There is beauty in so much of the city, and it feels almost criminal for me to say that I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. 

The simple reason for this is that the city is not equipped to handle the vast number of tourists that come and go through it. Where Milan and Rome have the room and infrastructure to cope, it feels like Florence is a bit of a gigantic mosh pit with no security. 

I am unsure what the solution is - perhaps it is to control the number of tourists, or to improve the public systems. Either way, I do hope that it is addressed in time to come because a city this beautiful should be cherished and shared with everyone. 

My favourite part of the city was the Boboli Gardens, which provided a respite from the crowds thronging the Uffizi Gallery and the Ponte Vecchio. Here, we were able to enjoy great views of the city and gave us our first glimpse of the Tuscan countryside. 

After two days in the main city, we headed by car to the countryside, which was by far our favourite experience of the entire vacation. 

We drove from Florence to Siena via the scenic SR222, a route which would take us through little towns in the Chianti region, vineyards, olive groves, cypress trees that seemed to go on forever. It was such a wonderful drive that I would recommend wholeheartedly to anyone. 

I don't know about you, but my impression of Italian drivers before the trip (maybe influenced by how many Italian F1 drivers there are!) was that they are hyper aggressive and go really fast all the time. The reality was so far from my worries -- Italian drivers were just the same as drivers I've met in any other country. 

As long as you followed the traffic rules and drive with some common sense, you will be just fine. Parking in Florence is a whole other thing though. We ended up parking outside the city at the last station of the tram and taking that in. At least the overnight parking was free!

On the second day with the car, we visited Pisa - stopping in Livorno for a seafood lunch. I still think about that plate of vongole spaghetti... it was that good! Pisa was actually a pretty nice town, quiet and beautiful except in the middle of town with the leaning tower and other sights. 

**Rome (Day 12 - 15)** 

We arrived in Rome as the temperatures began to soar past 30 degrees, which is not unlike the weather in my home country, but the sun was unrelenting with not a portico in sight :/

They say that Rome is an open-air museum, and it's a really apt description. I had imagined that each place of interest would be quite a distance from the other, but in truth it was just 1 - 2 kilometres apart, which made it technically possible to do multiple sights in a day. 

However, with kids, we opted to pace ourselves and limited things to just one sight per day, starting with the Vatican Museum, Pantheon, Colosseum and Roman Forum. Living near to Vatican City was actually quite nice, in a neighbourhood that felt mostly local. 

An interesting experience we had was when we saw fare inspectors board the public bus we were on. We had paid our tickets, but a few other tourists had not. That day, I learned that it was a EUR 59 fine per person if you tried to dodge the fare!

Rome in general was very busy, especially near the attractions. The service we got at restaurants and gelateria was not as good as in the other cities. Perhaps it was just the volume of people that pass through the city, or it was just an off day. 

**Closing thoughts**

We thoroughly enjoyed our two weeks in Italy, and I am already thinking that we should return at some point to go either further North (Piedmont, Turin, Genoa) or South (Naples, Sicily). It is truly a beautiful country with so much to offer. 

When I told many of my friends I was headed there with my family, every single one of them warned me about pickpockets and petty crime, but to be honest, we never felt unsafe throughout the trip and I think a lot of the concern comes from a good place, but is slightly overblown. Just take basic precautions and even if something does happen to you, don't let it ruin your vacation. 

Italians are rightfully proud of their cuisine, and I loved spending two weeks eating our way through the country, but I was a little surprised that it was not more diverse. I was expecting to encounter other European cuisines from neighbouring countries like France or nearby Spain, but for the most part, the food was distinctly Italian. This is not a complaint, just more of an observation. 

And with that, I think I have come to the end of this super long trip report. Thank you for making it through the lengthy post, and I hope this helps you plan your trip if you are intending to visit soon!",4,1750432608.0,ItalyTravel,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! ‚ú®

Let‚Äôs face it: **brain fog sucks.** One minute you‚Äôre ready to conquer the world, and the next, it feels like you‚Äôre trudging through molasses, right? Anyone else ever stared at a blank screen for *way* too long, wondering if you even *know* how to type?

I‚Äôve been there, and I‚Äôve got a super simple trick that literally takes 10 seconds. Yep, just a mere 10 seconds can help zap that fog away and bring some clarity back into your life. Here‚Äôs how it goes:

1. **Find a comfy spot.** üõãÔ∏è Just a moment of peace. (Pajama pants optional.)
2. **Close your eyes.** üö´üëÅÔ∏è Let your mind drop the hustle for a tick.
3. **Take a deep breath in.** üéà Count to four as you inhale through your nose‚Äî*feel your belly expand.*
4. **Hold it.** ‚è≥ Count to four again‚Äîlet the calm wash over you.
5. **Exhale slowly.** üí® Breathe out through your mouth for a count of six. Picture all that fog drifting away like *bad vibes* at a party you didn‚Äôt want to attend anyway.

Rinse and repeat as necessary. üòè 

### Why does this work? 

Because **breathing slows you down.** ü§î When we‚Äôre in ‚Äúgo-go-go‚Äù mode, our brains take a hit. Stress spikes, focus dips, and before we know it, we‚Äôre wondering if we left the stove on *again*. This little reset helps bring you back to the moment‚Äîkind of like a mental Ctrl+Alt+Delete.

### Here are a few times I‚Äôve used this:

- **Before a big meeting:** I was a bundle of nerves but came out feeling like the confident superhero I wish I could be every day. üí™
- **When studying for exams:** I took a second to breathe deeply, and bam! Topics I thought I'd never remember became crystal clear.
- **During those mid-afternoon slumps:** Forget the coffee! A few mindful minutes can power you up just as well, if not better.

So, what do you think? Have you tried a quick mental reset like this before? Or are there other little tricks you use to clear the fog? It‚Äôs funny how something so simple can feel like a *secret weapon*, isn‚Äôt it?

Ever feel like you're on a hamster wheel and someone just *cranked up the speed*? You're working harder, pushing through the days, but it all seems to blur together like one long, exhausting loop. Been there? **I was totally there** last week, until I decided to try something... kinda unusual.

**Nasal breathing.** Yep, you read that right. For seven days, I said goodbye to mouth breathing (at least as much as possible), and this simple switch turned into a *game-changer* for my energy levels and focus. Spoiler: My cortisol levels? They freaking DROPPED.

Here's the lowdown on my little experiment:

- **Why Nasal Breathing?** I stumbled across this claim that switching to breathing through your nose can reduce stress and boost energy. Sounded like a win-win for someone stuck in grind mode like me, so I figured, why not?

- **The First Days: Awkward AF** ü§® At first, it felt strange focusing so much on something I usually do unconsciously. It's like trying to watch yourself blink. But once I got over the initial weirdness, it was surprising how it started to feel natural.

- **Midweek Shift: More Energy, Less Stress** By day four, something clicked. I felt more *awake*. Mornings started to feel like a fresh slate instead of a heavy continuation of the day before. Even my buddy remarked on how I didn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôd fought a bear pre-coffee, which was a bonus.

- **Data Talk: Cortisol Levels Plummet üòç** I‚Äôm no scientist, but I checked out my cortisol levels (using this handy tracking gadget), and yeah, they were noticeably lower. Am I attributing it all to nasal breathing? Maybe. Who cares when I feel this good? üòä

- **Sticking to It:** Now that I'm over a week in, I'm sold. Nasal breathing is now part of my maxed-out routine, like my go-to morning podcast. It‚Äôs one of those small shifts that made a big difference.

So, what do you think? Am I nuts, or am I onto something? Take the plunge or just shake your head and smile‚Äîwhatever floats your boat! If you've tried it, or have your own quirky focus-boost hacks, I'd love to hear your stories. No conclusions, just a dialogue with anyone looking to *maximize their everyday* just like me.

**Trucks cause injury disproportionately to their use on the roads.**¬†

* In 2021, large trucks comprised only 4% of vehicles on roads, but caused 8% of pedestrian fatalities and 11% of bicyclist fatalities across the entire US (US Volpe Center)

* Lateral protective devices,¬†
* Convex mirrors,¬†
* Crossover mirrors, and
* Back-up cameras.¬†



**The current law is progressive by US standards but does not go far enough to protect vulnerable road users.**

* Only vehicles owned or contracted by the Commonwealth are required to have the safety improvements as the law currently stands.¬†



**The proposed law** **expands the requirements for these life-saving technologies to** any vehicle operated under a contract with, leased or purchased by:¬†

* municipalities,¬†
* utilities,¬†
* wireless providers or¬†

* quasi-public entities in the Commonwealth.¬†



Expanding the requirements for truck safety devices is an incredibly important step to making sure that **every truck in America is safer.** Please consider submitting your personal stories with testimony in writing or in person to show the Committee why these expansions are important.

It‚Äôs been in my mind and my now husband doesn‚Äôt believe the story not one bit but, m your advice would be much appreciated 

.this story is pretty deep to me. It still upsets me until this day from what happened and how stupid I was. 


Around 2021 (I didn‚Äôt know my husband at this time) I was on an app to meet people. It was a friends app not a dating app. It was an app where you can meet people from all around the world who speak different languages and came from different countries to the us. (I was 17 at the time) I met this guy who I wanted to be friends with on there. He was Korean. He lived in Chicago and I lived near (I don‚Äôt want to say for privacy reasons).

Some context I was homeschooled for middle school and high school and felt extremely lonely and found it hard to meet people. I went in the app simply looking for friends to connect with. The guy that I met on the app at the time came to my town and we went out for coffee and then went to ikea and looked around. The next time we met I went to Chicago to his house. I went there purely to connect more  and just hang out (as friends k really didn‚Äôt expect anything sexual out of this). Well me still being 17 at the time and he was much older than me. I really just thought only friendship. But he actually gave me an alcoholic drink that literally just tasted like strawberry soda and I thought it was. Also the drink wasn‚Äôt in English so o didn‚Äôt know it was alcohol. I drank it because I really thought it was soda but I felt some weird feeling like Almost feeling light and dizzy so I asked my friend if I could go lay down in the extra bedroom. One thing led to another I was in the bed and he was making a move on me I denied but he was persistent. He ended up rubbing on me until he finished and I was just praying for it me be over. 

I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene and deny him because I was scared of being hit and much more. So I really just closed my eyes and hoped for it to all be over until he was done. (Remind you from what I remember he did not put ‚Äúit‚Äù inside of me he only rubbed it one me and then finished on my stomach. I stayed another night and it happened again. I know staying another night was wrong but I was really confused and just felt so low at that time, I was genuinely scared to ask if I could go home. Luckily on that same night he said I had to go home and he took me home the next day.

Anyways still 2021 after the Chicago guy took me home he left me feeling confused and shooken so I wanted an answer and i tired to ask him what the heck happened but he never replied. I then met my now husband a few days later and we became friends quickly. At this time I asked my now husband to text that guy on behalf of me to get him to answer me and he did. (It didn‚Äôt make me feel better just made me block him the Chicago guy) anyways I met my now husband and fell for him quickly. We are now together of course,

1lg6eh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1lg6eh5/persistent_candida_or_thrush_gut_dysbiosis_my/,"Persistent Candida or Thrush, Gut Dysbiosis - My Journey","For over three years, I‚Äôve been dealing with persistent vaginal Candida infections mainly¬†*Candida albicans* that haven‚Äôt responded well to standard treatments. I‚Äôve taken fluconazole 150mg (multiple courses), long-term clotrimazole 150mg pessaries, and even tried nystatin orally, which helped reduce my white-coated tongue for a while. Still, the yeast infections have kept returning. I also tried chlorella for detox support, but didn‚Äôt notice any significant improvement.

A recent vaginal swab again confirmed a profuse growth of¬†*Candida albicans*, while my gut microbiome test painted a deeper picture. I have a major overgrowth of¬†*Prevotella copri*¬†(making up 61% of my microbiome), elevated¬†*Klebsiella*spp., high¬†*Slackia*¬†and¬†*Eggerthella lenta*, with low butyrate producers and an absence of¬†*Akkermansia muciniphila*. My diversity score was low, zonulin was high (suggesting a leaky gut), and stool sugar was significantly elevated likely a sign of poor absorption.

I suspect that over time, my gut went through several insults poor diet, possible mold exposure, overuse of antibiotics, and stress all of which weakened my gut lining and immunity. I likely have hydrogen sulfide SIBO, which explains my morning urgency not sure though.

Now I‚Äôm taking a more structured, gut-healing and antifungal approach:

* **L-Glutamine + PHGG**¬†(first thing in the morning) to support gut lining and nourish good bacteria.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii**¬†(30 mins after) for gut immunity and to crowd out yeast.
* **Tributyrin**¬†(after coffee or midday) to boost butyrate, reduce inflammation, and heal the colon.
* **Florita LL**¬†(before lunch) for probiotic support including¬†*L. rhamnosus GG*.
* **Omega-3 fish oil** 
* **Chelated zinc + copper**¬†and¬†**magnesium 375mg**¬†(after dinner) to support immunity and calm the nervous system.
* **Pomegranate peel drink**¬†(evening) as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

Diet-wise, I‚Äôve cut out refined sugar, ultra-processed foods, and high-fermentable carbs. I‚Äôm avoiding most dairy (except ghee), gluten, and gas-producing pulses for now. I focus on simple meals with rice, blanched and saut√©ed vegetables like spinach and broccoli, coconut chutney etc and pomegranate or banana occasionally. Coffee is limited to once a day, and I space it apart from probiotics.

Despite all this, I still get occasional vaginal discharge and itching. I believe this is part die-off, part persistence of the fungal issue likely because the underlying gut imbalance hasn‚Äôt been fully resolved yet. I‚Äôve decided to add nystatin again as a next step.

This healing journey hasn‚Äôt been easy, especially while trying to conceive. But I finally feel I have a better understanding of what‚Äôs going on and more importantly, what to do next.",1,1750432205.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

Every guy I actually hang out with, I've known them since middle school. Let's call them Jake, Marcus, and Tyler same crew from when we were 13, and we're pushing 30 now.

Don't get me wrong, I love these idiots. But when's the last time any of us made a new friend? My girlfriend constantly has new people in her life coworkers she grabs drinks with, someone from her yoga class, a neighbor she met walking her dog. It's pretty wild how naturally that happens for her. Also my guys would literally help me move at 2AM without question, and I'd do the same for them in a heartbeat.

The funny part is we've all changed completely since we were kids, but instead of finding people who share our actual interests now, we just adapted to each other. Marcus got super into photography last year but never joined a photography group. Just shows us his expensive camera gear while we nod politely and pretend we understand the difference between lenses that cost more than my car payment.

I think part of it is that guy friendships as adults feel awkward making new friends. Like you can't just tell someone hey, want to be friends? Without it being awkward. Plus everything costs money now, can't just ride bikes to someone's house and play video games for free like when we were kids. Even grabbing coffee to get to know someone feels like this whole production.

Is this just how male friendships work, or are we all just too comfortable being stuck in our ways?",61,1750432074.0,self,121,0.78,False

Later, I found out from his friends that no one else was with him that night. Red flag.

Yesterday, same thing, he said he had a club meeting but ended up at that same coffee shop. I decided to go there and saw him sitting alone with a girl he‚Äôs been close with lately. Just the two of them, laughing and sharing food.

I confronted him and he said they‚Äôre ‚Äújust friends‚Äù and she‚Äôs someone he vents to. But I checked his messages and they‚Äôve been flirty. He even asked her to hang out while I was working.

*Homeplate*

Grezzk's life had changed in several ways. It was refreshing in some ways. Each day was a steady stream of visitors, such that the door to their quarters was opened before breakfast and never closed until it was time for everyone to sleep. While the children were not particularly troublesome, they were children and required a great deal of care and supervision. The Clanmothers were helpful to a point, but at the same time there were other children who needed care and learning. Lomeia was a gift from the gods in this - she seemed to be everywhere, and her organizational skills as a librarian were highly useful. Despite all of this, there was one thing in the way.

They didn't have ships. Or a name. Several had been considered and subsequently ignored, while the few that remained seemed equally useful. She tapped her finger on a tablet, examining it carefully. Nhoot was singing Hurdop songs to Rhipl'i and her brothers and giggling at the faces they made. It was odd to hear familiar songs with different words - almost as odd as her recent habit of putting printed stickers of the clan symbol on her bare shoulders. Still, she looked at her tablet and paused for a few moments while she considered how many stacks of paper she would have gone through before all the things that had happened. Still, not matter how many times she ran through the numbers, the result was the same.

They could do this fast, in which case they would have to ask for help or they could do it slowly, in which case they were going to hope that space didn't destroy their company. With that reality tapping through her head, she sent a message to Vilantia and looked up to her door as a familiar scent heralded Lomeia's arrival. Oddly there was a great fear of something in the air.

""Greatlord Aa'Lafione - my father - sends word. He says that he intends to challenge my choice in joining the Freeclan.""

There was a grimace, and even Nhoot fell silent for a moment before she looked and blinked.

Grezzk looked down, considering the message she'd sent to Lady Ah'nuriel. She was going to have to send another one.

Nhoot trundled over to give Lomeia a hug as well as temporary possession of Rhipl'i before looking between the two for a moment, concern and curiosity large within her before she spoke.

""I don't want Papa to kill her Papa."" She paused. ""It makes Papa sad when he does that, even when he has to.""

Both Lomeia and Grezzk blinked at the young Hurdop who blinked back as if they were the ones missing the obvious. ""On the old ships, challenges were always until someone couldn‚Äôt move. Is it not like that on the Vilantia?""

Grezzk lifted Nhoot up gently. ""No. Papa will have to prove his leadership before the Arbiter of Challenge. Normally it's a Lord from a third clan who is supposed to be fair. But these days I'm not sure a proper Arbiter could be found.""

Nhoot scrunched her face up. ""Can we go to Vilantia and tell them to leave Papa alone?""

There was a soft laugh from Grezzk. ""We can't my little fighter. But we can ask the gods to listen."" She paused. ""And no, you cannot stow away on the next ship bound for Vilantia.""

Nhoot pouted at her Plan B being exposed. ""...but I want to help Papa.""

""To do that, this time you'll have to stay here. Sometimes the best things we can do are from afar.""

There was due consideration given to this before Nhoot's Plan C formed on her face. ""Okay Mama!"" The she hopped off and retrieved Rhipl'i from Lomeia before dashing to her room.

Lomeia looked at the bizarre display and looked at Grezzk hesitantly. ""What...what is she doing?""

""I am not sure. But it will show itself in time. For the moment, we need to assess what we can bring to the Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative beyond our credits.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Delia caught up to Gryzzk during lunch. While she had toned down the volume of her dress and scent, the colors more than made up for it. Today the colors shifted and changed, but always seemed to settle on the company colors more often than others. Or it was simply that Gryzzk noted the company hues more than any other colors. She settled with a small salad garnished with cheese and looked around regally before speaking.

""So has your secretary told you what I would like to propose?"" Delia cocked her head inquisitively, the strands of light woven in her upswept hair pulsing through colors in a slow rhythm.

Gryzzk winced in spite of himself. ""I do not have a secretary, I have an Executive Officer. She is also second-in-command of this ship and hears everything that happens. She also has a very colorful vocabulary and no problems expressing herself should the situation warrant.""

There was a casual wave in return. ""Oh, you don't know how truly valuable a good secretary is. They may as well be second-in-command. In any event, I have something of a proposal. Your daughter is a delightful individual, but she needs to learn things. She knows so little of even the sector, perhaps broadening her education would help her decide what she wants to be?""

Gryzzk was thoughtful as he considered this. ""Does this program include the rest of the company?""

There was a puzzled expression. ""Why should it? It would be for children.""

A soft chuff was Gryzzk's initial reply. ""It is becoming known on my homeworld that the Terran clan way includes literacy for all. We don't believe in that - we use common scents and shapes, and in certain areas hired readers to read letters aloud.""

From Delia's expression, Gryzzk may as well have slapped her. Or worse, criticized her fashion choices. ""You...your people can't read?""

""The majority can. But there is a significant minority who can't.""

""But...but how?""

""How do we not read? Forgive my saying but you'll have to expand the question a bit more.""

""No, how do you not teach people to read?"" Delia was flustered. ""

""Quite frankly, it's a matter of resources. As an example, before all of this - "" Gryzzk gestured to the mess hall casually ""I was a Lead Servant in a household that was known for it's wines and food crops. We were relatively well off. But every night for three years before the treaty with Hurdop, our power was disconnected at night to ensure that the arms factories could run unabated."" He lifted his tablet. ""I knew in general terms how a tablet worked from my father's stories, but we did business on pen and paper - and as soon as a contract had been fulfilled, the paper was scraped and cleaned for a new set of words and the scrapings collected to be remade into new paper sheets."" Gryzzk's voice softened. ""But this, these things that we're doing now will help, but overall? Reading is *wealth*, and my homeworld - our destination - is not rich.""

Delia looked like she was almost ready to burst into tears. ""But how could Chastity...she...her...her friend can read?""

There was a nod. ""Of course she can. Her aunt was a Minister, with privileges I will never know if I live twelve generations past my time.""

Delia picked at her salad, her scent becoming somehow morose, as if she was realizing the depth of the water she was about to dive into. ""I - but you have art.""

""Of course we do. We have art in all it's various forms, parks, and sport, all of the civilized things that the public at large enjoys."" Gryzzk slid out from his table, noting Charles going through the line for his lunch and selecting a table with other Terrans. ""We even have an area on the ship for recreation. If you would care to join me, I will show you a few other things we have.""

His offer was considered and then there was a nod. ""Of course. I think...I think I need to think.""

The two walked slowly to the recreation area which brought a few surprises for Delia. First was the ""No shoes"" reminder, which brought her up short.

""But...why?""

""A decision made by my daughters. Nhoot was from a Ship-clan and had never felt grass before her first visit to Vilantia. She was so taken by it that at our next refit she and Gro'zel had a grass floor put in. I think it lifts the mood of the ship quite a bit."" Gryzzk slipped his shoes off and placed them in a small box. ""Do not concern yourself - your shoes will be where you leave them.""

The second surprise for Delia was seeing Reilly with a cup of coffee and the electro-gurdy, singing softly to a semi-circle of individuals - it was a song about a child who was struggling against their parent's expectations, with the chorus talking about how the child was numb and unable to feel their parents there and wanting to be more like themselves and less like their parents. There was even acknowledgment that the child could fail in whatever they were doing, but the alternative to being themselves was unthinkable.

After she finished that song Reilly moved into another song, this one much more deliberate and measured - it was a song from a woman's perspective, begging someone to not be Romeo to her Juliet. As the song carried on, verses were sung to the protagonists' parents to calm them and make sure they both knew that there was never a story of more woe than that of Juliet and her Romeo.

Gryzzk frankly didn't understand the song - it touched on parts of the Terran psyche that were unknown to him, but Delia's demeanor changed dramatically. First there was surprise, then it morphed to shock and fear bordering on horror. Gryzzk looked up to see Delia paler than he'd seen her. Not a good sign in Terrans. Then when Reilly finished, she looked up and saw the frozen Delia on the other side of the dayroom.

There was a long moment before Delia turned and fled. Not dramatically or for any effect, but the terror of someone confronted by something that they didn't want to witness but couldn't deny.

For Reilly's part, she looked a little embarrassed and tired. She stood up, putting the instrument in it's case before walking over to Gryzzk.

""Major...I didn't sleep too well last night. I'll make it, but I ain't gonna be crisp.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""I understand."" He checked his tablet. ""You have three hours. I'll have Rosie wake you for breakfast. Now scoot.""

""Yeah, I should do that before I get Delia'd."" Reilly hefted the case and made her way to her quarters, humming softly.

Now that he was relatively free, Gryzzk decided that now would be a good time for a impromptu inspection of the ship. The doctors were arguing about some specific of bone density to necessary tendon and muscle, but not unkindly - which surprised Gryzzk on several levels. Vilantian divorce wasn't unheard of, but the circumstances that surrounded such things made it impossible to have the former couples within scenting distance. In addition to that, the rumors he'd heard about other Terran divorces made him think that thrown objects and hurled insults were the norm. He made a note in his tablet to investigate further as he poked his head into the armory - ostensibly for inspection, but this was a day that made him long for the scent of a wife.

He regretted this action immediately. It seemed that there was a rivalry of sorts between the Infantry-Security section and the Armory as he took in the scene from the armory proper to the range. Firstly, the Terrans in each squad seemed to be acting like horses as they hunkered down on hands and knees in preparation. Each Terran had a Vilantian or Hurdop secured to the 'horse' with duct tape, and each rider had a plastic pipe in one hand and a food tray shield in addition to their upper body armor. At a whistle, the two horses would race toward each other while the riders would attempt to knock their opponents off using only the pipe. During this, his wife was wearing a referee shirt and waving flags to signify who had won the respective round.

Gryzzk watched a few passes as the respective squads cheered and jeered, trying to figure exactly what was happening before Kiole lifted her head and moved it left-and-right to discern a familiar scent. Finally she saw Gryzzk and froze for a moment before she spoke.

""*Grizzly Alert*!""

At that, the entire room fell silent and everyone scrabbled to attention, despite the inherent difficulties of looking appropriate while having another individual duct-taped to them. The only sound was someone going ""Shit"" followed by a thump as a rider hit the deck solidly.

Gryzzk closed his eyes. The scent of the armory was highly entertained, and overall he knew that this was necessary in some odd way. However the rules in this were clear. He was going to have to demand an explanation from the sergeants. The sergeants wouldn't outright lie, however they were going to be coming up with a ridiculous explanation for what was happening. Finally he was going to have to accept it and also convey a level of disapproval.

""Sergeant Wahlgren, Sergeant Nelas. Why do I not see the two of you in front of me?""

The two sergeants rushed to the fore. The armory sergeant had Prumila taped to his back, while Sergeant Nelas had decided to be more expedient and simply taken her shirt off, standing in front of her commanding officer wearing shorts and an athletic bra, leaving Col'un to stand as best he could.

Gryzzk placed his palms together, fingers just under his nose. He took a deep inhalation, scenting the dirt under his nails that hadn't been fully washed away before he exhaled half a breath. He'd given them all the time he could. ""I am waiting for one of you to explain this...event.""

Sergeant Nelas cleared her throat. ""Well sir, what had happened was we were engaged in a historical re-enactment. Of sorts.""

""Additional training, sir."" Wahlgren added helpfully.

Gryzzk kept his voice and emotions professionally neutral - it wouldn't do for the non-Terrans in the room to immediately notice that he wasn't believing them. ""Both historical re-enactment and training? While I am not as well-versed in history as our Engineering department, I must confess I have never heard of either the Vilantians or Hurdop using Terrans as riding mounts.""

There was a voice from the back who quietly commented ""Someone needs to check with Lomeia about -"" the rest of the comment was cut off with a whuff as an elbow was delivered sharply.

The sergeants ignored the comment - at least immediately. Nelas continued explaining the scene. ""Well, Terran history. You see cavalry horses used to be really expensive to keep and maintain - so to offset some of the costs, they invented some games and such to keep the horses fit and soldiers ready. That way when the Lord or King or whoever called they'd be ready like good cavalry are. One of those things was jousting. Two knights and the object was to knock the other knight off his horse with this bigass thing they called a lance.""

Wahlgren picked up the tale. ""And well, while our normal PT routines are solid, you sometimes need to work muscles you don't usually use so in case you have to do something else. So after we were dismissed for free training, we thought it might be good to have an unorthodox session and also give some folks who don't know the deep origins of the cavalry a chance to see some of it first hand.""

Part of Gryzzk's mind was complimenting himself on his assessment, while the inner Lead Servant gibbered and howled about the impropriety of it all, from the duct tape to Nelas' uniform choices to the fact that his secondwife was part and parcel to all of this. There was a mental strip of duct tape torn off as his inner Lead Servant was gagged and thrown into a closet for later dispensation.

""Well, with such an explanation I can see the wisdom within it. Please, pass my compliments to your captains and let them know that I look forward to their reports regarding any additional training that they deem necessary.""

Their deflated scents spoke for them as Gryzzk left the armory and continued forward to the bridge to settle and actually command the ship - at least until dinner.

When the hour came, he went to the mess hall, where he found the Reillys already eating and having something of a rational discussion. Somewhat. Delia had regained her equilibrium somehow and was most dominant voice, with the gentlemen at the table being reduced to bystanders for the evening match.

"" - But I don't understand why you won't help with this? Certainly it would help this...company. Additionally it would help you rise beyond your...well."" Delia was being patient, after a fashion. Her scent was hidden in some way which didn't exactly comfort Gryzzk.

His comm sergeant exhaled from her position facing away from Gryzzk. ""Because one, not my call to make. You want to work with this company you ask the Grizzly, not me. If you were paying attention, you would have noticed he signed off on this job, not me. That's called a hint. And B, I cannot exaggerate how little I want to help you."" She gestured at the mess hall. ""All of this is transactional. You sign off on this, we do the job, and then we get paid."" Reilly looked back to her mother. ""And you go run your little world for another year until you decide it's time to try bring your defective product home again to be fixed so that your social club can't make you feel bad with their little jabs about how your batting average with spawn is only two out of three. So this little educational thing is your way of trying to convince me that you haven't finally gone full-blown batshit crazy.""

Delia exhaled as Gryzzk settled in his spot before she continued. ""Major, convince my daughter that I have this, this company's best interests at heart with my proposal.""

Gryzzk wanted no part of this - and yet here he was. ""Sergeant, she believes the company would be served well by whatever she proposes.""

To her credit, the younger Reilly didn't snort in derision. ""No.""

Gryzzk shrugged, looking back at the elder Reilly. ""I have tried, but she seems particularly obstinate today.""

Delia took a calming breath. ""I see.""

Gryzzk fixed his eyes on Delia. ""You ask me to commit to something scent unknown and retain the ability to be surprised when rejected. You are an amazing individual. I'm sure at some point I will find out what exactly is being proposed, but at this moment I remain quite uninformed.""

There was another calming exhale from Delia as Reilly used the shift in conversational targets to head for the bridge. She looked at the sergeant leaving with frustration evident.

""I do not understand."" She sighed softly. ""I'm trying to help with education - that is something even you admit is necessary.""

""I presume you have a candidate?""

""Of course I do. Jasper, he would be a perfect fit. He loves the outdoors, enjoys working with people, sculpts with foamed marble when he's not teaching...he's a wonderful person.""

""Has he been consulted?""

""Well, no. Not yet. I was going to tell him when we returned to Anchiano.""

Gryzzk had almost finished eating, but paused. ""I think perhaps there is a lesson of sorts in this. You seem to have an expectation that the galaxy bends to your will, and it seems in many instances it does. However here there are things you cannot, and should not control - specifically my sergeants.""

Delia looked up and around. ""But she's just a little girl.""

Gryzzk softened his voice. ""I don't believe that she is. My daughters - now they are little girls. And in the years to come, they will become women in their own right, and all I can do is hope they have learned proper lessons from their parents."" He paused, considering his next words. ""Keep the memories of her as a little girl close, because they are something I will never know. But until you can see what she's become, how you see each other now will never change. She will never call you mother, and you will never call her Jenassa. And that is the pity of it all, because I find her company...educational.""

Delia considered, attempting to salvage something in her favor. ""Perhaps. But we still taught her so much. She should thank us.""

""With the proper approach, she might. Until then, thank you for the enlightening conversation."" Gryzzk stood and headed to the bridge, where he nodded to each of the squad before retiring to his quarters for another night of reading about plantlife.",27,1750431626.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

I was with my mother at a food truck getting coffee, it was really warm and quite busy. I am neuro-divergent so this can be an issue, I also suffer from body dysmorphia and have been struggling with this a bit more than usual recently.

Whilst sat at the food truck my mum entered into various conversations with the other people there which I had no issue with but this left me to get stuck in my own head. I tried to tough it out so I didn't ruin the experience.

Eventually it got to a point where I was really struggling and felt like I was about to have a breakdown as the dress I wore (one she bought for me and doesn't make comments about like she does with other ones I own) was very uncomfortable and I could not stop spiralling into feeling awful about how I looked.

I said to her that I was really struggling and that I needed to go home to get changed and then we'd come back and get more coffee (we were only a 5 minute drive away from my house) she had driven us so I needed her to take me back.

She continued her conversation and even started new ones whilst I waited at the car, I waited for as long as I could but all the time I was stuck in my own head.

I ended up saying loudly ""Mum come on"" to this she didn't really respond for a few seconds before turning to the person she was in conversation with and saying ""I've been summoned"".

When we were in the car she told me I was acting like a spoiled brat. I told her I felt like she should more understanding about my mental health than finishing her conversations. Her response to this was that she didn't know if the person she was speaking to would be there when we got back (it was the owner of the food truck), that it was rude to interrupt and that the world can't revolve around me.

We argued a bit after this but I let it go and she drove me home to change. We then went back to the food truck and got more coffee but I still wasn't feeling great. I ended up cutting the rest of the day short and went home where I have been feeling so much that I can't really process it and feel like she might be right and that I am just being dramatic and I was acting like a spoiled brat.

1lg612g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lg612g,Mormons culture explained by ex Mormon,"For the past two years, the Mormon culture has intrigued me. Mainly things like; why are most of them so famous, why are most of them influencers, and so on. That is the main reason why I watch a lot of these more influencers, really just trying find what information I could. Like I really had/have so many questions about their culture and their dominance in entertainment. I recently stumbled upon this ex Mormon‚Äôs YouTube channel and her videos answered many questions that I wonder about. I feel like her videos gives you a good sense of why Mormon culture is the way it is. Her videos also give you a good sense of why Mormon influencers are the way they are. I just thought I should share this because I‚Äôve seen a lot of comments debating certain things about morning culture. One thing I found is interesting is how she explained in the, I believe it‚Äôs mlm video. She explained how Mormons  have this copy culture, that‚Äôs pretty much why they mostly look the same. Always made up, blonde hair, and extensions. That‚Äôs why they all copy the same soda shops and any other ideas that they steal  like oils and stuff like that. I also found this pretty interesting. She explained how Mormons are very good at PR. They just know how to make themselves look good, which makes me think about the ultimate PR stunt they can pull. We all know that the Mormon church saw brown or dark skin people as inadequate to white people, I‚Äôm just using a nice word btw. She explains this in one of her videos if you want more detail. Now for two years, I‚Äôve wondered why do they adopt so many brown or black children? It didn‚Äôt take me long at all to notice how many Mormon families adopted black children. I personally think it‚Äôs a stunt, a stunt rooted so deep. That a lot of them were subconsciously manipulated to believe that they should adopt these black children. The church definitely rebranded to be slightly more inclusive, we know that happened. it‚Äôs not hard for me to believe, the church manipulated it‚Äôs congregation overtime to push a new agenda. She also goes into a little detail on that on how the church manipulates its congregation, and also the outside world. After watching her videos, it definitely my answers my questions.

* A long, narrow console or table to the right of the dining table (maybe for storage, or a little coffee bar)
* Another seating option in the living area in front of the window by a few feet. We're thinking of maybe a loveseat, adding more sections to our current couch, or even something like a Big Joe beanbag. We really enjoy hosting, so any additional seating would be a plus!

INTRO: Whispers in the Fog

The sun crests over the Black Forest like a slow exhale, spilling light onto the serpentine roads of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Shadows cut between the pine trees, and in that fading grey glides a silver BMW E36 sedan‚Äîunassuming, even forgettable.

No spoilers. No flares. No vinyls. Just steel, scars, and history.

Its inline-six purrs beneath the hood like a cat resting before a hunt. Worn tires cling to crumbling tarmac with a kind of grace no new car can replicate. In the rear cargo space, a six-pack of Rothaus Tannenz√§pfle clinks gently beside a styrofoam crate of bratwurst‚ÄîWeber's family recipe.

Behind the wheel is Leon Weber, 18 years old. Quiet. Methodical. His eyes rarely blink. His hands shift not with urgency, but with muscle memory older than himself. He doesn‚Äôt speed. He flows.

His destination: a local inn off Route 28. One of many. The Weber name has been delivering sausage to this region for three generations. The E36 was never meant to be special‚Äîit just is. Leon has known no other way.

Back in St. Georgen, hidden behind the modest family butcher shop, Matthias Weber tweaks something on a rusted circuit board with a magnifying lens. An analog man in a digital world. Tools older than Leon hang on pegboards. Above his workbench, a dusty photo. A black-and-white snapshot of a young Matthias in a DTM team jacket. Barely smiling. Back row.

Most wouldn‚Äôt recognize the face. But the old racers would. And they'd still murmur his nickname:

‚ÄúDer Architekt.‚Äù

He built machines that defied odds‚Äîand logic. But he doesn‚Äôt talk about that.

Not to his son.


---

CHAPTER 1: The GTI from Donaueschingen

The GTI pulled into the back lot of the bakery like it owned the concrete. Flat black. Gutted interior. Race cams audible even at idle. The exhaust note was throaty, aggressive‚Äîhungry.

Leon didn‚Äôt look up. He was loading crates. Methodically. Carefully. The bratwurst had to arrive chilled. The beer had to arrive unshaken.

The GTI's driver leaned against his door, chewing gum with the sort of posture that begged for attention.

""That your ride?"" he asked, gesturing at the silver 3-6 with a scoff. ""Didn‚Äôt know old men‚Äôs cars were still on the road.""

Leon paused. Wiped his hands. ""It gets me there.""

""Bet it doesn‚Äôt get you there fast.""

Matthias, who had just exited the butcher shop with a cup of coffee, didn‚Äôt say a word. Just observed. His eyes scanned the GTI. Calculated its upgrades in seconds. Overbuilt. Under-disciplined. A hammer trying to thread a needle.

The GTI driver smirked. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got. Sunset run. Down to the reservoir curve. You game?‚Äù

Leon blinked. ‚ÄúYou bring beer?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou race me, you better not spill it.‚Äù

The other guy laughed like he‚Äôd already won.


---

The sun dipped. The road emptied. They lined up on a forgotten stretch of forest road‚Äîthe kind with fading lane paint and no GPS signal. Leon tapped the dash. No tach, no HUD. Just the sound of an engine warmed by experience.

The GTI launched like a shotgun blast. Wheelspin. Roar. Showmanship.

Leon rolled out with precision. No rush. Second gear clicked in with the softness of a heartbeat. The 3-6 breathed in the curves like it had lungs. Between tight corners and long sweepers, Leon barely adjusted his line.

The GTI brake-tapped. Oversteered. Overcorrected.

Leon never touched his brakes.

At the final descent into the reservoir basin, the GTI‚Äôs tires screeched in protest. Leon downshifted into third. Let the chassis do the talking.

They reached the lot. Leon parked. Checked the beer.

Still cold. Still calm.

The GTI arrived half a minute later, engine coughing.

Its driver stepped out, red-faced. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is in that car?‚Äù

Leon shrugged. ‚ÄúSausage.‚Äù


---

Back home, Matthias added a note to a small leather-bound book. It only had two columns: ‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutcome.‚Äù

Under ‚ÄúGTI (Donaueschingen),‚Äù he wrote:

> No beer spilled.



He took a sip of tea. Didn‚Äôt smile. Just whispered:

‚ÄúGut gemacht, Junge.‚Äù

earlier, i asked my mom who lost her mom 20yrs ago. and asked her how was it like when she lost her mom. our convo:

me: how was it like when u lost ur mom, do u still miss her? 

mom: ofc i do

me: until now? like in a daily basis? 

mom: i do, at times i remember her but not daily 

me: when u first lost your mom, was it really hard to the point u miss her everyday? 

mom: i do for the first year, but after that i started to cope better. maybe its because at that time, i already moved out of the house for few years to build our family with your dad (our place is 2hrs away from her mom's place) 



because of this convo, i started to think things like 'would it hurt less if my dad passed away when i was already living on my own or had already built my own family and dont live with him in the same house anymore? or would it hurt more bcs if we dont stay at the same house, i wouldve regret more not spending more time with him before he passed away?

1lg5vui,https://i.redd.it/hyg5umlwh38f1.jpeg,Tummy Tuck & Lipo Recovery: Days 1-4,"I know I personally scoured Reddit for people‚Äôs early recovery stories post-tummy tuck (with muscle repair) and didn‚Äôt find too many, so I figured I‚Äôd share mine while it‚Äôs still fresh (and I‚Äôm still semi-horizontal). üòÖ

I had my surgery done in Canada 4 days ago ‚Äî tummy tuck plus lipo in my hip area to fix some misplaced fat from a previous procedure in Colombia (shoutout to Dr. Alex Campbell for the... creative placement?). The attached photo is day 1 results of that repair lipo. Looks great. Not regretting my choice in surgeon to fix this mess, he's amazing üëè

Anyway, here‚Äôs the day to day of my recovery experience thus far:

Day 1: Surgery was at 7 AM, and I was heading home by 11:30 AM, which felt wild. Pain level: HIGH. I basically sprint-crawled into bed, downed painkillers, and passed out. Once I got on a good schedule with meds, the pain became more bearable, but wow, moving around is a full-body workout. Had my husband helping and booked a private nurse for 2 hours that day. That was a life saver.

Day 2: I actually woke up feeling okay! Clear-headed enough to check a few work emails from bed (why am I like this). There was some bleeding from my incision. Sent a pic to my surgeon who said it's normal/just monitor. Nurse came back, and we got me into a very high-waisted girdle thing, plus the binder on top - surgeon's orders. Needed the girdle to cover the hips that were lipo'ed. But the girdle was waaaaay too tight. I started getting bad back pain, nausea and acid reflux, and I knew it was too tight. At midnight, in a haze of discomfort and regret, I took off the girdle, put on some Spanx with the binder on top, and sent a panicked message to my surgeon because I know the importance of compression but I just couldn't wear it. Barely slept that night.

Day 3: Absolute chaos. I ditched the tramadol at 1 AM because I was convinced it was the root of the nausea, but it didn‚Äôt help. I was so nauseated I couldn‚Äôt even stomach yogurt, toast, nothing. Back pain, nausea, major life regret - it was all happening. Feeling so angry that a previous surgeon botched me and left me in this mess. I never wanted a tummy tuck. My husband was so concerned he called the nurse back again a second time this day. Surgeon was right: day three is the worst. I pride myself on being a solid surgery recoverer, but this one hit like a truck. At this point, I was off everything but Tylenol because pain was manageable - it was the nausea that was ruining me. That evening I took my prescribed, anti-nausea and an over-the-counter Gravol because I was totally desperate. It worked, kind of! I slept only waking up four or five times which was a win in my books and woke up feeling slightly more human.

Day 4: it's only 8:30 AM on day four but I already feel like a different person. Well good enough write this post while still horizontal and things are still fresh üòÇ I have just kept down a piece of toast and drank my first coffee in three days and it tastes like liquid heaven.

Second day: 3 dulcolax, increased prune juice, fruit smoothie, coffee, increased fluid intake, walking, stretching. nothing

Third day (d-day): 3 dulcolax, miralax, increased prune juice, apple juice, increased fluid intake, walking, stretching (I did not do a fruit smoothie or coffee, the coffee makes me nauseous and I hardly ate anything yesterday bc of the discomfort).... this worked.

I‚Äôm 22 a student I‚Äôve worked in industry and I‚Äôm currently doing an internship where my direct manager is an operations gentleman everyone there is older and im the only person who is actually in the demographic that they targeting. 

They are luxury student accommodation and they are charging a lot of money and they want to target the Chinese. Btw I am the Chinese. 

These days Internet culture is so different like it‚Äôs unrelatable to a lot of other people. I don‚Äôt find it funny like the toilet or the brain rots. But it‚Äôs just the internet so many times brands like KFC India a coffee shop with young gen zs have gotten 600k plus likes following trends like ruby chan haiiii. 

They want me to post boring on personable millennial content. Like currently, there‚Äôs a video of them being like like a shot of a Chanel. Were five minute walk away. No one cares that is not gonna sell the apartment. GEN z is so different. 

Even Chinese is crazy it‚Äôs like our content but like 100 times more chaotic 100 times crazier. Basically he wants me to do is like if I own a boba store just talk about how clean the boba sgore is instead of you giving personality and relatability relatablity. 

I can afford to live at that accommodation. My friends can afford to live at that accommodation. We are not sales we‚Äôre marketing, yes I can market amenities and they‚Äôre great. Don‚Äôt get me wrong but it has been done in a way that‚Äôs visible to your audience.

They want nothing trendy, no songs but boring elevator music with some photos. Like why are we firing marketing managers and relying on AI when this is the outcome. 150 rooms, 10 bookings. No one in operations should head a marketing department of 2 interns LMAO. 

I‚Äôm just so frustrated any other young marketeers experienced this?

1lg5nn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1lg5nn2/neighbors_guest_setting_up_shop_on_the_steps/,Neighbor's guest setting up shop on the steps outside my bedroom,"Hi, I think I might be gaslighting myself into being overly considerate to my smoker neighbors and I need some insight. üò≠ TL;DR at the bottom.

Some background on my apartment: I live in a 100-year-old single-family home in rural Minnesota that was shoddily converted to 5 apartments at some point. I signed the lease sight unseen (MISTAKE). I wear earplugs to sleep because I can hear sounds outside my apartment as if they're inside my apartment. My apartment takes up the front side of the weirdly-shaped house and runs parallel to the hallway, so I hear absolutely everything in the hallway. And the door at the end of the hallway goes outside to a very small set of steps (the landing can fit maybe 3 people standing up) that leads to our little parking lot. My bedroom window faces these steps, and I have to keep my curtains closed at all times because I've seen people peering in before.

An older woman moved in across the hall about 2 months ago when I had already been living here for a few months. She started smoking on the steps right outside my bedroom window, which was frustrating because I have no A/C and was using that window to let air into my bedroom (it's the only window in that room). I didn't make a fuss about it at the time because she's really sweet and old and smokes at least a pack a day. So I didn't want her to have to walk up and down the steps to smoke further away, and I've just been dealing with not being able to open my window. I have had to tell her not to leave the hallway door open while she smokes in the doorway, because the hallway was starting to reek and I couldn't figure out why the smell was so strong until I saw her out there with the door wide open.

Fast forward to this week. I think an old man has moved in with her, and I discovered this morning that he has now set up a folding chair less than 6 inches from my window to smoke. He set his coffee on my windowsill. He woke me up yesterday on my day off, talking to my neighbor loudly. I can hear every word of their conversation because my room is very small and my bed has to be close to the window. And I already wear earplugs to sleep because the door to the steps shuts loudly when slammed, and my neighbor doesn't try to close it quietly. 

I got a little passive aggressive yesterday morning and played music on full volume from my phone and left it by the window while I did chores. I kept the window closed because I wanted to see if they could hear it as clearly as I could hear their voices inside. I don't think it worked, and I felt bad about it all day because I overthink things due to OCD. They also woke me up at 8am and I feel like maybe that's too late in the day for me to be so annoyed.

But this morning they did the same thing, and I couldn't snooze before work like I usually do. I put clothes on and walked outside to politely confront the old man. He set up his chair so it blocks the steps entirely. I told him that my bedroom window is RIGHT THERE and that he and the neighbor have been waking me up in the mornings because I can hear everything outside. He said that he just goes out there to smoke and that he'll be quiet from now on, but I don't trust that at all. And he didn't seem to see any problem with sitting there even though I use those steps to get to my car, and just to get in and out of the building in general. If I go out while he's there, he'll have to fold up his chair and stand to the side to let me through.

I just really can't tell if I'm blowing things out of proportion in my mind, because this pisses me off so much that I've been fixating on it throughout the day. Like I said, I have OCD. I don't think MN prohibits smoking outside a residence, and I don't think my lease does either. I've considered pointing a fan OUT the window for airflow and playing music on my windowsill from a speaker in the mornings to deter them from hanging out there. Would that just make things worse? I don't know.

For more context, I have no friends or family in this state, I just moved here for a job that only lasts until December, and I'm definitely moving at the end of my lease in January. I can't tell if I'm going crazy from the loneliness or if this is a normal thing to be pissed about.

TL;DR: An old man has moved in with my neighbor and has started setting up a folding chair less than 6 inches from my only bedroom window to smoke cigarettes, blocking the outside stairs on that side of the building. He said he'll be quieter when I politely confronted him about waking me up this morning with his loud talking. What should I do if he continues to sit out there, and do I have the right to be annoyed? Thanks üò≠",11,1750430372.0,neighborsfromhell,7,1.0,False

Mr. Ellison was a man of habit. Every morning, he‚Äôd polish the brass gears of his grandfather‚Äôs clock shop, wind the pendulums, and sip black coffee while reading the market reports as if decoding a message only he could understand. But today, something was different.

His banker, Mr. Halbridge, arrived unannounced.

‚ÄúStrange time for a visit,‚Äù Ellison said, wiping grease from his hands.

Halbridge glanced around the room, his eyes settling on a faded chart pinned above the workbench ‚Äî a series of rising arcs and one peculiar dip.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here for accounts,‚Äù Halbridge whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here about *velocity*.‚Äù

Ellison nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs accelerated then?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeyond expectation. The forecast shows a clean *reversal*. It‚Äôs not just speculation anymore ‚Äî the *sentiment* has shifted.‚Äù

Ellison smiled faintly. ‚ÄúAnd the *pipeline*?‚Äù

‚ÄúFinalized. Leaked yesterday to a few ears. Monday it becomes... *louder*. They‚Äôll all be chasing it by noon, but the entry window is closing.‚Äù

He turned toward the ticking wall of clocks. One, in particular, chimed a note deeper than the rest ‚Äî a grandfather model marked with the word *Helios* beneath the minute hand.

‚ÄúHow fast do you think it‚Äôll *scale*?‚Äù Halbridge asked.

‚ÄúTo the sky. It‚Äôs built for *lift*. The last time I saw this sort of calibration, it went *double*.‚Äù

Halbridge placed a sealed envelope on the counter. ‚ÄúInside is the ledger,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRead between the *ticks*.‚Äù

As the banker disappeared into the fog, Ellison returned to his bench. He didn‚Äôt need to open the envelope. He already knew what was coming.

By Monday, the whole street would hear the clocks ringing. But by then, he‚Äôd already be gone ‚Äî hours ahead, where the gears always turned smoothest.

As the scene draws closer, the ambient ticking grows louder ‚Äî layers of gears clicking in unison. The warm, amber light from the workshop‚Äôs oil lamp flickers against the brass instruments on the bench. The camera drifts past Mr. Halbridge‚Äôs retreating silhouette, past the scattered tools, and finally settles on a single yellowed note pinned to the clockmaker‚Äôs bulletin board.

The envelope, once sealed with wax, is now torn open ‚Äî but the letter inside is not financial in nature. It is poetic. Obscure to most, but crystal clear to Ellison.

Written in neat, slanted penmanship, the riddle reads:

**""I ride the air yet hide in ground,**  
**Where silence sings and wires are wound.**  
**Born from drift where drills descend,**  
**My spark begins as headlines end.**  
**Not oil, not gas, yet just as light ‚Äî**  
**I lift the world, I vanish flight.**  
**I‚Äôm not seen but charts will know,**  
**Come Monday's bell, I start to glow.""**

Mr. Ellison smirks faintly. He doesn‚Äôt need more time ‚Äî the answer is already there, hidden to the uninformed, blazing obvious to him. With a pencil, he underlines just one word in the note:

**‚ÄúLift.‚Äù**

And beside it, he jots a ticker. A single word. Then folds the paper and returns to his quiet symphony of gears.",1,1750429727.0,u_JT_MarginCall,0,1.0,False

I don't want to act like I'm super smart because I'm not and my theories on shows are often insanely wrong especially shows as cleverly written as this one but this one makes way too much sense to me. it's heavily researched and I've been thinking on all but my actual suspect for weeks now. and if I'm right this would probably be a big twist revealed at the end of 2x11 so if you wanna go in with 0 ideas of what could happen, swipe out now. this is also gonna be a long read with quite a bit more until I get to my thesis statement so you've still got time before it gets too direct. also has brief/vague spoilers for episode 9, a new lease on death. mostly posting this here so people can tell me how my logic holds up kindly or so it looks really dope if I'm right.

rotten tomatoes synopsis of episode 11: ""Abandoning her serving job at a fancy wedding, Charlie vows to clear the name of a friend caught in a compromising position.""
rotten tomatoes synopsis of episode 12: ""Charlie questions everything she believes in as she races to warn the target of a notorious killer before it's too late.""

now, I think it's safe to say these two episodes are a two parter. rian and natasha's ""guess the guest"" game confirmed three actors will be in multiple episodes, two of which will make their first appearance in 2x11, and a third actor is listed on IMDb for 11&12 when the 2x12 cast is currently largely still unlisted. 
I also believe these episodes will be about a serial killer (""notorious killer"" + fbi presence at a wedding). and one who can lie to charlie. I've posted before about how I wondered if the ""world's greatest sociopath"" hypothetical from sleazy georgian was foreshadowing and now I think it is. and in yesterday's episode, a new lease on death, there was a line about how it sucks when someone isn't who you thought they were, which also felt like GLARING foreshadowing to the audience. and the fact that the finale synopsis begins with Charlie questioning everything she believes in. what does she believe in? her ability. what would make her question that? if someone were to slip past it. which led me to believe that charlie would trust the wrong person because her lie alarms had never gone off with them only to find out they had been lying to her and she just couldn't tell. 
now the foreshadowing from today made me very very afraid because foreshadowing this far in advance made me think that the reveal would be more of a gut punch than the average friend charlie makes the same episode something goes wrong. it felt like a relationship they'd set up so the audience FEELS it when it's all a lie which only left Luca and Good Buddy. Good Buddy felt obvious and weak (and idek for sure if we'll ever see him) and making Luca evil would be like the dumbest thing they could possibly do. 
so since my two parter theory got confirmed by them confirming Justin Theroux was in two episodes in the ""guess the guest"" video, I decided to go back and see who else they confirmed and they confirmed Taylor Schilling and Patti Harrison for multiple so I looked up who they were playing. Taylor is playing an antagonistic FBI agent trailing Charlie so that's out. but then I looked up... Patti Harrison.... playing Alex..... coffee girl from new lease..... in FOUR episodes (three confirmed but I believe the finale too) starting with this one instead of the others' count of two. 

Guys... I think coffee girl might be a serial killer. 

first, Alex is described as Charlie's sidekick, which is a major red flag. this show doesn't work if charlie has a sidekick. a friend yes, even a recurring friend she doesn't see often but can count on in certain situations like Luca, that makes sense, but charlie settling in one place and getting a sidekick is so antithetical to the show so early so I feel like something's gotta bust this buddyship up. 
second off how early they're setting this up. this show has no problem getting us attached to a character and Charlie's relationship to them and then ripping it away in one episode, so why spend the extra time setting up this friendship and getting us attached if you don't want it to be an absolute (shoutout to Gavin) *suckerpunch* when it's all taken away?? 
third thing and here's the fuckin kicker: Alex's thing is that she CANT LIE. she is UNABLE TO LIE. so of course Charlie's gonna trust her and wanna keep her around, and when we find out about that, we and Charlie are never gonna expect anything she says to set off Charlie's alarms because why would they?? she can't lie!!! unless she can and does the whole time but she's such a sociopath that she evades Charlie's detection. 
which leads me to her introductory coffee scene in the recent episode. with this theory in mind, I rewatched the coffee scene and noticed a few things. when Alex walks out of the coffee shop we see her looking down at the coffee cups in her hands before walking up to Charlie's table and I believe she was checking the labels because hers was black coffee and she KNEW she was about to hand charlie one that wasn't. second off while fumbling through her apology for giving Charlie the wrong coffee and blaming the workers she said ""and I said it was black coffee and I lied"" to which charlie reassured her that she didn't lie. now that's really weird word choice generally if you know you were just misled but it's really REALLY weird word choice if you know you literally can't lie. I think alex set up an innocuous, lie-filled first meeting to test if she could lie to charlie, even straight up saying she lied to see if charlie would contradict it, and Charlie was none the wiser. 
honorary mention: the day of the premiere, s2's showrunner tony tost was asked which performances he thinks will be most surprising and his FIRST answer??? PATTI HARRISON. 

now there are some things I don't know yet like how she'd know about charlie or how she'd follow charlie through the country. but like..... I wasn't even looking at her and making the attributes match, I didn't even know she'd exist til today; but I had in my head for weeks that if I was right, the character would probably have to befriend charlie at some point before 2x11, and be someone we and Charlie would trust heavily in a very short time, be confirmed for 2x11 and be working the wedding with Charlie so they'd be close (she is) and wouldn't set Charlie's alarms off with anything they're saying making charlie question everything when they actually were lying. and then a quick googling gives me a sidekick for Charlie who can't lie and is introduced two episodes in advance???? YO
so my theory of events is: charlie and alex bond next episode and probably even solve the week's murder together. then in episode 11 Alex gets in some kind of trouble, 'compromising position' could even mean looks like she killed someone, but says she didn't do whatever it is, so charlie believes her because in her and our minds it's double verified. and Charlie helps her, somehow along the way accidentally setting up her next victim. then at the end of the episode it's a MAJOR plot twist that it's been Alex all along, Alex has been following her and lying since introducing herself and Charlie missed all of it and now she has to grapple with that while saving whoever she probably accidentally sent Alex to. (bonus theory that I'm a lot shakier on, I think the season ends with Charlie on the run again but from the law this time somehow)

TLDR: I believe Patti Harrison's Alex, introduced in 2x09 as the girl with the coffees, who is going to develop into charlie's sidekick who can't lie, will be revealed at the end of 2x11 as a serial killer that episodes 11&12 will focus on, and is lying all the time but is enough of a sociopath that she manages to evade Charlie's lie detecting. and 2x12 will be about stopping her and dealing with the ramifications of charlie being fooled.

I'm new to espresso and coffee in general and am looking for some recommendations regarding grinders.

I've been using an Aeropress and a Kingrinder P2 for 6 months and finally decided to get a Bambino. I've been enjoying the learning process so far but have been thinking a lot on getting a better grinder to improve my shots.

In my current place I do not have any counter space left for a electric grinder like the Encore ESP or DF54 (which are options that I would consider), and it's going to stay like that for at least 1.5 years. So I've been thinking on getting a better hand grinder like the Kingrinder K6. Currently I drink 1-2 shots a day and I don't mind the hand grinding part of the process.

Leaving aside the fact of convenience, If I get a K6 would it be comparable in quality to a DF54 or Encore ESP? Or would I be better just using my P2 and waiting until I move to a different place and get an electric one.

I'm interested in your opinions / experiences in similar situations. Thanks!",1,1750429464.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

So what I always aim to do is hook them on my basic foodstuffs, while they produce coffee, dyes, tea etc for me.

So what I often end up doing is either tagging over to them to destroy all their grain farms, or build over every single piece of arable land before releasing them.

It would be so much easier if I could just force my colonies to build only cash crops I can't make in the imperial core.

You get to hear my honest opinion and I get to keep 'em *(spoiler: I do like them)*. Let's go.

[I treated myself to a huge piece of raspberry tart :\)](https://preview.redd.it/wh1a59l3d38f1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddc2cb744f03d8c558c7edf53fa3917e9670fea0)

These are my new companions by day and never knew how much I missed the ANC (active noise cancellation). I've been going by old technology, my 7-year-old wireless headphones. Great sound, but too big, too clunky. The Buds will be going everywhere with me now instead. The case is small enough to fit in a front jeans pocket.

Although it's been raining on and off for the past two weeks - and today was no exception - the cafe was chock-full. While on the go, I usually listen to music or podcasts. Actually it's more of the latter, because I couldn't properly enjoy my bass-heavy music (Trap, EDM) with the old headphones that provided zero noise dampening. Bass was easily lost to noise and I don't crank up the volume to compensate for. You see, I care for my hearing ;) I even avoid the main street on occassion to escape the traffic noise.

I had already configured the buttons in the app the way I like. Case out, buds in, long tap right to turn ANC on and... No, I was still here in the cafe, but the chatter became quiet enough that I could focus on the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_euF2Y-cIE) and gaze at the rain outside, where more people queued at the door to get in. Take a sip here and a bite there. To be clear, the cafe was actually too loud, but ANC helped enough for me to not be distracted.

It does a better job outside though. **All** low-pitched noise is completely blocked. Passing by cars were the main culprit why I couldn't enjoy music. Despite ANC I can still hear some of the noise from tires, not even 100 km/h (60 mph) cars are a serious nuisance. In the city at half this speed, cars don't compete for bass in my ears anymore. I can actually enjoy music or hear a podcaster clearly despite walking along a busy street, at my comfortable volume levels.

This made me realize how much low pitched noise is around us. Even at night, I live only 2km (1.25mi) from a busy Autobahn (German highway). The distant traffic noise isn't annoying, but can be clearly heard with windows open. Once you turn on ANC, it's gone. Completely. There you walk at night, just you and your music. Pure bliss.

It's the kind of quality of life improvement you didn't know existed, but now you wonder why didn't it come across earlier.

For more extreme scenarios: the ANC did pretty well when I was standing on a bridge right above the highway. Wind gusts bring it to its knees (that's >5 m/s or 25 km/h or 15 mph; ""moderate breeze""). Otherwise wind is barely noticeable when jogging. If you turn off ANC at these wind speeds, you simply begin to hear the low-pitched wind noise due to aerodynamics. Can't cheat physics after all :)

**Fit:** If not for LG, I wouldn't have dared to buy the buds form factor out of fear of a loose fit. Prior experiences of cheap included in-ears burned into my mind. I think their fit is flawless on me? I can walk, run, shake my head, eat(!!!) and they show no signs of slipping out. Having worn them over 6 hours at a time, there's no discomfort or anything.

On the other hand, the xboom Buds' rubber fins for extra grip don't fit me: they are supposed to latch onto the ear. I could've swapped them out for the included flat rubber, instead I feel them with the fingertips to adjust rotation for a tight fit. Doesn't bother me as per previous paragraph.

**The sound** was good out of the box. Later I ended up spending quite a bit of time tuning the equalizer through the official app. Suprisingly, my preferred EQ landed pretty much between the ""Natural"" (default) and ""Immersive"" presets! Thus they were tuned well without my tinkering.

Somewhere online I read an opinion criticizing a lack of bass? Not at all. The bass is there and isn't shy to present itself. Despite the ""xboom"" name, they are not boomy ;) And if you somehow wanted even more bass, the low end of the equalizer is there to help you; try the ""Immersive"" preset.

btw, I appreciate LG's honesty there. Their presets show exactly what they do on the EQ, no hidden magic sauce. On another note, even the flat line EQ delivers good sound. Therefore the drivers are too - LG advertises them as graphene drivers.

**The app** was easy and pleasant to use (Android). Take it from someone who usually despises extra bloatware. Although it's not necessary to be used. You can update firmware, tune noise cancellation, enable beta features (reduced latency aka game mode, wind detection), configure buttons and EQ. It allows to tune into nearby Auracast streams too, if your device doesn't support it yet. To be frank, only a couple places in the world really use it yet.

**Battery & Case:** Good quality materials used and the plastic is nice to the touch. I like how the case opens and closes (: it's a pleasant click. Though you can't handle it with one hand. The buds are recharged very quickly. I mean one toilet break is enough to last you a while. The case battery isn't too big. If you use them all day, to stay in the battery-friendly yellow zone you'll need to recharge the case once every 1/2/3 days. The buds themselves will need to recharge after a full day, but they belong stored in their case anyway.

**Water resistance:** Rated IPX4 aka ""light rain"". Considering it's in your ear, it'll be a little safer than that. Sure this is not impenetrable, but gives a peace of mind to walk in the rain.

**Versatility:** Besides music and videos: voice calls. I've been walking through a forest near the highway. With ANC on, I could still hear the birds chirping all while the traffic remained very quiet. On the microphone quality: My friend commented ""It's a delight, I can hear the birds like I'm in the forest with you.""

All well, although my phone doesn't yet support the newest Bluetooth LE Audio with the HQ LC3 audio codec for playback+microphone. Once my devices and¬†xboom Buds are going to¬†support it, I expect the Buds become my headphones for everything: music, phone calls, voice chat, games.

1lg54yi,https://i.redd.it/arromz1cc38f1.jpeg,"Black Afgano by Scents by Saka ‚Äì Dark, Addictive, and Completely Unexpected","Just wanted to share my thoughts on a fragrance that genuinely caught me off guard ‚Äî Black Afgano by Scents by Saka.

Let me start by saying: this is a clone of Nasomatto Black Afgano, and a pretty damn impressive one at that.

From the very first spray, it pulls no punches. You get hit with this bold, unapologetic wave of cannabis, green notes, saffron, and thyme ‚Äî like a deep inhale in a forest that‚Äôs hiding a few secrets. It‚Äôs herbal, almost narcotic, and unapologetically different. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to feel at first‚Ä¶ but it drew me in, fast.

Give it 15‚Äì20 minutes, and it really starts to evolve. The heart is smoky, warm, and just a touch sweet ‚Äî think resins, tobacco, coffee, cinnamon, with whispers of violet and raspberry. It feels like stepping into a dimly lit lounge with leather chairs and low jazz ‚Äî cozy, but with a hint of danger. In the best way possible.

The dry-down is where it truly shines. Hours later, I‚Äôm still catching waves of oud, incense, amber, vanilla, tonka, and this slightly musky, animalic edge that adds real depth. There‚Äôs a complexity here that keeps you sniffing your wrist just to catch all the layers.

Projection and longevity? Insane. Two sprays, and I‚Äôm set for 8+ hours. It‚Äôs not your average crowd-pleaser ‚Äî but if you like your scents bold, smoky, and a little wild, this one‚Äôs worth every drop.

Definitely not an everyday wear ‚Äî but when the mood hits? Nothing else compares.

Rating: 9/10 ‚Äî for those who like to make a statement without saying a word.

Would love to hear from anyone else who‚Äôs tried it ‚Äî what did you get out of it?
