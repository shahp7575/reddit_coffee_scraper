It’s sad Watching innocent men getting scammed REPEATEDLY by a duck lipped russian babe who thinks she’s a princess but came from village in Northern Siberia with no electricity and only speaks level one of Rosetta Stone English.

If the Tinder date is not coffee or a walk to get to know each other, most likely it’s going be an expensive bill at a Nightlife establishment or an overpriced restaurant.

1hkogml,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hkogml/i_know_it_sounds_absurd_part_four/,"I Know It Sounds Absurd, Part Four","Since the day that Stacey walked, or rather, bounced through those doors on that Friday the 13th, I had been feeling as though the very ground beneath my feet was always shifting around, always unsure of what I was doing, if I was even doing it right or not. 



My concentration was off all the time now. Her voice stayed in my head hours after we went our separate paths for the night. 



She drove a 1981 Chevy Impala, and I mean she drove the hell out of that car. The first time she drove me home from work I got the idea that she really didn't have much to live for. At least judging from the way she flew down Hwy. 37. 



I've always been a little more mindful of the safety aspect of driving techniques. I Don't crowd, tail gate or drive too slow. I believe in the Arrive Alive philosophy.



She was from the mountains of West Virginia and decided to relocate after getting out of a bad marriage. She moved here for a clean slate and another chance. 



While I was just glad that she was here. In no time at all we were spending almost every possible second together that we could swing. 



A camping trip that a few of my buddies and I had planned almost a year earlier came around, and I realized that I forgot to tell Stacey about it. I was extremely pleased when Stacey didn't get any kind of way about it. 



My last girlfriend would have declared a state of emergency for an oversight like that. I had been looking forward to it for so long, but all of the sudden I didn't really want to be away from Stacey for two weeks. 



My last girlfriend. I didn't even put a name to her. She wasn't even Gina anymore.



That's when I realized that the sound I was hearing deep down inside was the alarm going off, and I hadn't been paying attention. 



I felt like I needed to make that hike. I promised myself and my friends that I was going to go. Now I realized that I had to go no matter what.



I needed some time alone to clear my head. To put a little distance between Stacey and myself. All of a sudden I started to understand that I didn't just like her, a lot, or have some crush. I was falling head over heels. 



Something that I swore to myself I would never do again. Fall in love. There is a reason they call it falling. I had to get straight with myself and two weeks hiking the Appalachian Trail would be just the prescription I needed. 



She spent the three nights prior to my leaving at my place. We laid in bed all day unless we were working.  Hanging out, really. Taking a little breath for each other.



We took our meals there, watched some classic comedies and horror movies, and talked about stuff endlessly,  subconsciously feeling each other out for possible future compatibilities, looking for landmines now before we went too far and stepped on one later. 



On the day of the gangs departure it seemed to me for the briefest of moments that she might cry. We embraced so long at Timmy's van that we had to be reminded that we were indeed on a loose schedule. 



We were told that we needed to remember that we would only be gone for two weeks and could probably get to a stopping point at anytime.



We got all the standard issue remarks like, ""Why don't you two get a room."" and the like. Then I heard Mikey say, ""Smoochie, smoochie. My little possum bottom. I loves you!"" and the van erupted with laughter, including Stacey and I. 



We kissed one last time and I climbed into the van, forcing myself to be a man and not look back as Eddie pulled the vehicle on to the highway.



With a little bark of the tires as we hit pavement, our adventure was afoot. 



Something like eight hours later we pulled into a little town three hours from our first destination. We had planned on spending our last night in civilization in a motel room, with a fine steak dinner in our belly's, and then a smoke off. 



Every one of us had decided to bring at least a half ounce of the best weed we could get our hands on, so we were going to have our own little version of the Cannabis Cup to see which of us had bragging rights from now on out. 



There was Mikey, Eddie, Timmy, John A., and me all together at one table at the steak house. The crew. Never a dull moment. I was surrounded by the kinds of friends most people never have the fortune of knowing.



It had been a long time since we were all together. The older you get it seems the less of a priority hanging out with your buds becomes.



Eddie was married with two kids. In a perpetual loop of job hunting. Every other day or so he would get half-way dressed up and go ""pound the pavement"" in search of that elusive beast known as gainful employment round these parts. 



Although most days it seemed he would get confused. Those days his car could be seen parked off Hwy. 37 beside the Cushion Creek pull off.  He would park there and then go sit on an outcropping by the deepest part of the waterway. Throw out a fishing line and decide no one was hiring.



Mikey was working two jobs and fixing up a small house he bought over the previous summer. He was twenty-six and this was his second house that was paid for and coming right along. 



But he was in the middle of a full blown psychological melt down situation in his love life. His fiance announced that instead of being a criminal defense attorney as previously planned, she now wanted to work in the DAs office.



There was no way in hell he would married to a DA or anyone in their office, and that includes the receptionist. He'd be damned if he would even live in the same house with someone of such dubious character.



John A. had been married  a little more than a year and a half. He had been promoted to project manager at his dad's engineering firm and was making mad money. Yet he never seemed happy anymore, always worrying about making even more money.



Timmy was still knocking around trying to find a foothold. 



Me? I was working as a cook in a steakhouse, spending way too much money on whatever substance would help me forget that I was a cook in a steakhouse. That meant I spent way too much time hungover or chasing normal one shot at a time.



My car had been repossessed a month prior to the trip, I was already imagining how I was going to ask my grandparents if I could return because I was on thin ice with the management at my apartments due to my drunken escapades. And I was one more call out from work from not even being a cook at all. 



Something that I didn't know at that time was that in one month I would get my first of two DUIs. That would be one small catalyst for a change. Little did I know at the time that in just five months I would be on track for a new life. A sober life. 



The one thing I did have going for me was I was in love. There was no doubt about it now. When me and the crew were together there was never any time for anything else to be on my mind except for the then and now. For the first time in along time I had someone who was somewhere else but constantly on my mind. 



Would Stacey like this, would she be able to let her hair hang down around my boys and have fun with us? I found myself thinking about her almost all the time we were apart. How nice it would have been if she were there. 



Would we hang out late with the guys or would we end up going back to our room early to simply enjoy each other? At times she was there in my mind more than the people who were actually there in person. 



We had a blast on the trail for those two weeks. I had done a lot of thinking about my relationship with Stacey and decided that when I got back I would sit her down and explain my feelings. 



I would ask that we put a little distance between us, start going a little slower so my head and my heart could be on the same page. A little distance couldn't hurt things if she felt about me as I did her. 



As soon as I got back and she stood up on her tip toes to give me a kiss and every single plan I had created to put a little distance between us went out the window. I told her we should move in together. So much for distance.



She agreed with all the giddiness of a school girl meeting her favorite band and we set our sights on one month out.



I told her that I didn't like any surprise knowledge bombs being dropped on me after i had unpacked my stuff, put my toothbrush in the bathroom, and ruffled up the bed. I looked her in the eyes and asked it there was anything about her that I should know about.



She said yes, there was something I should know. Two things actually. 



One was that she was still married to her husband, he wasn't an ex after all. At least not yet. She assured me that it was me that she loved, and she had never intended for that to happen. 



But now that it had, she loved me more than she had ever loved anyone before. Way more than she had ever loved her husband. 



The second thing was something that she had planned on telling me as soon as I returned from the hike, and that was that she had a son. He was six years old and his name was Noah. 



She explained that she didn't think to tell me at first because she didn't think in a million years that things would get serious between us. She just wanted to basically have a good time and had promised herself that she wasn't going to let anyone near her heart for a long time to come. 



By the time she realized how close we had become, she was scared if she told me that it would scare me away. I looked at her with the most intense no nonsense look I could muster up and asked, ""One question. Should I move my drum kit to your place?"" 



""You should."" she assured me. 



And that's exactly what I did. 



I put them up right there in the front room of the mobile home. I've always believed that a drum kit was living room or den furniture. It looked good over by the window, so I could keep an eye out for guest while I played or practiced, because there was no way I was going to hear a knock or doorbell. 



Things were great between us, it was as natural as could be. We got to the point where we could be in the same room sometimes for hours without ripping each other's clothes off. 



It was a load off my mind when we discovered we had fun together and still felt that bond even when we had our clothes on. It scared me for a while that this wouldn't be the case, but it turns out that we could just enjoy time together playing a board game or some cards. 



Her mother came to visit three weeks after the move in was complete and a week after that first DUI. She brought Stacey's son with her and decided to stay a week to get to know me, the guy that she didn't know who would be living with her daughter and grandson. 



Now, I had been around kids all my life, and I never had any issues at all with being around them. I had helped raise my two nephews until one moved out on his own and the other was getting his license. 



The secret to being around kids is to make them like you by acting like you didn't care if they liked you or not, while letting them know that you like them. Just do that and make sure you talk to them like you would any one of your more grown-up friends. 



And most of all, listen to what they have to say and at least act like it's one of the most important things you've heard all day. If you do that then you and almost any kid will get along. 



I didn't have to worry about any of that with Noah though, he took one look at my drums sitting there and decided I was his best friend. Turns out he was a pretty cool little dude. Smart and mature acting for his age and a pretty astute student of percussion. 



Her mom was a real trip. She showed us the bullet holes Stacey's dad had put in the back of her car for not making a pot of soup before coming to visit us. There was a noise picking up decibels in the distance, but I just ignored it. 



Stacey was scheduled to work the day after her mom came to stay with us. That morning I woke her up with a fresh cup of coffee. She sat up in the bed, cupping the precious coffee in her hands and inhaling the steam. 



I had started getting into the habit of waking her up with a cup of coffee in bed every morning she had to wake early and I didn't. Show some solidarity. 



""Now, you're going to be here with my mom, don't you let her talk you into doing anything you wouldn't be doing if I were here,"" she said with a little sly smile. 



""I don't know. She looks good for her age."" I didn't have to lie to make that statement. 



""Man, don't say that shit. Not even in jest."" 



""Stacey, I don't care if that was Kristan Bell in there, I have invisible blinders on for you and you only."" I found myself really meaning that, ""You're the most beautiful woman in the world to me. There may be someone out there that is just as beautiful as you are in their own sort of way, but there hasn't been the woman born on this planet who can truthfully say that they are more beautiful than you."" 



She stared at me like she was looking for some tell that would reveal me to be a liar, but I wasn't lying. I meant every word of what I said. She was the total package for me. Physical perfection to me. 



She finally softened up a little and I wondered if I would ever know the story about that scene. What past event had made her feel she had to worry about such a thing. 



I didn't have to wait long for the answer to that question. Within an hour of waking up her mom, Sherry, was blistered drunk and going way off track. 



Her come ons got cruder and cruder, each one more sexually overt than the last. When Noah just missed out on a perfect eyeful of grandmas tits, I figured it was time to get him out of there.



I asked Noah if he wanted to go for a walk and check to see what might be living in the woods across the street. 



Before we could get out of the house, Sherry had grabbed for my crotch three times and left nothing to the imagination when explaining what she was in the mood to do. 



I couldn't believe the kind of display she put on in front of her own grandson. She had Noah embarrassed, mad, ashamed, and depressed all at once. I didn't want to bring it up to him, but I would have if necessary. 



He broached the subject as soon as we went through the front door. He asked me if that was how I acted when I got drunk. It occurred to me that I've been known to show my butt, especially if 151 rum was involved. 



Those moments when everything around is spinning one direction but your spinning in the other direction. Those moments when you knew you would be puking shortly so you go looking for a landing spot. 



This was the first real time I witnessed first hand the effects of ones social rustiness being a little too lubricated. Here was a boy I barely knew and yet even I could tell how that scene with her mom changed his behavior. 



I made a promise to myself that I would pay more attention to how much I was drinking when he was around. And further more, I would not allow any of my drinking buddies in the house when he was around. Noah was a tough little kid, but seeing his grandma acting like that was pretty close to traumatizing him. I had to do better, be better. 



As Noah and myself walked around the park and the neighborhood, he tried to steal a bicycle out of a neighbors yard. I was very diplomatic about getting him to put them back and it didn't fuss about doing it. 



The whole thing made me think the little guy was actually testing me. Gauging my leadership abilities. 



Stacey got home early that afternoon and I was glad to see her. We hadn't been back to the trailer since we left that morning. 



We treated ourselves to some burgers and fries, them he headed to the playground while I sat at a table that allowed me a pretty good line of sight to anyone coming and going at our place. 



Then I just sat there nursing a coffee for hours and keeping an eye on our driveway. 



When I saw that sky blue Impala pull in the gravel drive I immediately felt my heart slip a beat. I wasn't sure about what I was going to tell her about today, or if I was going to tell her anything at all. 



Turns out, I didn't have to address it at all because Noah walked up to her and said, ""Mamaw got drunk and acted stupid just as soon as you left for work.''



"" And what do we do in times like those? I could have rushed home and made sure you were fine. ""



"" No problem, mom, "" he assured her, "" Me and Scott went around the block a few times. He really likes walking around the block. Then we went and checked out a creek in the woods across the street, "" he sounded really happy with my Hail Mary pass to the woods. I did good. 



Stacey smiled and looked at me, still smiling and asked him in a dramatically louder voice all sudden, "" So, did Scott do good taking care of things?"" 



""He did great, mom. You might want to get a new doghouse and keep this one a while."" 



She laughed, then added in that over the top voice and checking to make sure I was hearing her loud and clear, "" We might Noah. We might just keep this one a right spell.""



Her mom left early two days later. I never told her what had happened. I just didn't want to hear the excuses for the way she behaved. 



I had barely drank any alcohol at all since that day. Somewhere, deep in my brain a light had gone off, or maybe it came on, I'm not really too sure, but I could feel it in my soul that my drunken self was slowly on the way out. 



Sherry said she didn't remember anything about that morning ,which seemed to me just an evasion tactic.  She considered blackouts to be a good thing. 



I don't know how I completely missed what had to have been the most red flags thrown in just a seventy-two day period ever. Put it this way, I heard tales which led me to believe that Stacey's family was considered eccentric even for West Virginia mountain standards. 



At that very moment some eight hundred miles away, just outside of Morgan, West Virginia, James Merdows, Stacey Merdows husband, was walking through the kitchen of the remote little cabin feeling the suns rays as they finally starting the place warming. 



He walked loudly through that kitchen, boots proud to be on his feet while putting a cigarette to his mouth with a little snap of his wrist. 



He looked to the couch and made a mental inventory: one . 45 Auto. Smith & Wesson, a .357 long barrel magnum, also Smith & Wesson, one 12 gauge pump action shotgun, illegally modified by the sawing off of any unnecessary lengths making the weapon that is commonly known as a ""street sweeper"".  



And Barry's all-time favorite, the Thompson Forty-Five Submachine gun, front stock grip, straight clip. Everytime James told him that he wanted that gun Barry had told him the same thing time after time after time. ""You can have this gun the day you pry it from my cold dead hands!"" followed by that self-satisfied chuckle. 



A little earlier, that day had come. Just a few minutes ago James had indeed pried them all from Barry and his families cold dead hands. 



James gathered all the supplies he would need from Barry's shed, seeing as Barry, his wife nor teenage son would be using any of that stuff again. Finding Barry's car keys, James walked his sharp noisy stride out of the front door. He turned, locked the door and walked to the car while singing an old James Taylor song.

1hkogky,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1hkogky/ugh_i_hate_this_new_schedule/,UGH I hate this new schedule,"Work has officially changed my husband's schedule from 2pm-10pm Sunday-Thursday to 8am-4pm Monday to Friday. 

I hate it.

I had a whole schedule/routine in place with the afternoon schedule. I'd get up around 8, make coffee, wake the baby and we'd all just kind of hang out until I went into the office at 9 because no one had to leave or go anywhere until after lunch.

Now the day basically starts at 6am. I lay back down by 620 if I'm lucky and the alarm doesn't wake the baby but still. 

Even if I get to lay back down, I have to be up by 730 so I can make sure the toddlers bag and lunch are ready, get her out of bed, dressed, and make sure she gets her asthma puffer before she gets picked up at 815am. 

And that's just the before work changes! 

After work, I used to go into the kitchen and wash the dishes/clean counters, by the time I was done that, the baby was being dropped off at home. So I'd get her into her highchair with her supper and finish cleaning up what I needed to. Then I'd sit and relax and get the baby in bed for 8pm and around 915 or so I'd make supper. 

Now, he's already home when I get off work. So I get off work and walk out into the kitchen and he and the toddler immediately want my attention. While that's happening, I'm being asked what we're having for supper because he's been off work for over an hour, probably hasn't eaten all day and is ""starving"". 

So it straight into trying to wash whatever dishes might be needed and getting food on the stove/in the oven. 

Get that done, sit down to eat by 630. By the time supper is over its after 7. Clean that up, wash up the toddler and get her into her pjs. Then it's basically time to get her down for the night already. 

By the time everything is said and done, I don't get a chance to actually relax until close to 9pm the mass majority of the time, sometimes later.

And worse, I get almost none of the regular chores done because I have zero time alone after work to just blow through them uninterrupted! 

I finally decided to tidy the disaster of a livingroom before work today because it's the only way it ever gets done. 

It's so frustrating! I had a routine damn it! Now I have to figure out how to reconfigure the whole damn thing and make it work. 

Not to mention that now instead of the toddler being with the sitter for like 4.5hrs at most per day, she's there for at least 8 hours because she gets picked up around 8am and the husband goes to get her around 430 when he's done with work himself. 

Everything has been fucked with and I'm freaking tired. 

It feels like I can not get on top of anything anymore, I'm just constantly chasing it all and trying to make it work.",1,1734962820.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

I have to pretend to be full of holiday cheer and joy when in reality I feel anything but.

I'm a 40 year old dude and my dating prospects are wearing real thin these days. Not even sure how interesting or attractive I am anymore. But I thought maybe things were finally turning in my favor a couple weeks ago when I went on a date with someone I met from Bumble and it went really well. We met at a coffee shop and just chatted for hours, about a lot of pretty deep topics, and we didn't seem afraid of discussing anything with each other. It was wonderful and lovely...I don't feel like even my family or friends listen to me all that well, and this woman did. I started crushing hard.

We went on a second date, and that was equally as lovely, if not a bit brief, because of how busy we both are this holiday season. But I had the idea of going to this cute Christmas market in the city, followed by dinner afterwards, and she gave me a warm hug and smile afterwards. I felt like things were still going well, if not maybe a bit slower than I would have liked.

We texted a few times since then. She sent me pictures of her cat. But a few days ago, her cat, who had been suffering from jaundice, was found to be seriously ill with something, not officially diagnosed yet as far as I've heard, but some serious liver condition that might not be treatable, and she's only 8 years old. The woman seems really bummed about this. But now she appears to be so bummed that she's not even speaking to me...

Is it about the cat? Or is it about me? She said earlier that she was free early this week, and I told her yesterday that I would be free today. I know she read my text; I got the read notification and everything, but total silence from her end. I get being bummed about her cat, but the fact that she couldn't say ""I like hanging out with you but right now I'm super sad about my cat and I just need some time"" tells me that she's maybe not as invested in this as I am. I still cling to a bit of hope that this might work out, but in some ways that's making this many times worse, as it is just prolonging my shitty feelings and giving me even less clear resolution to all of this. I've heard nothing from her for days now, and I've been blown off and ghosted more times than I can count that I just feel like I know exactly where this is headed.

So, I'm just sad. I just want to lie down and do nothing. I feel nauseous. I feel like shit. I feel like things are just never going to get better for me. I have a really good job, but it's stressful, and I've taken some time off during this Christmas break and REALLY need to spend it relaxing and de-stressing to prepare myself for everything coming next year. But so far this has been far less restful of a time than anything I've experienced lately. Frankly it would be LESS stressful to at least go to work and get my mind off things. That's where I am with all of this, lol. Fuck me.

For real, I got together with my extended family last night, and it might have been the lousiest Christmas celebration I've ever had. My brothers and my cousins show up with their wives / husbands and kids, just surrounded by love and adoration and living their best lives, and this time around it was really twisting the knife for me. When is any of this ever going to happen for me? Will it? I'm forty fucking years old and I still haven't found what I'm looking for, so what makes me think it could happen now, after not happening for all of the 20+ years where I've actually been looking for it? 

I just feel fucked.",2,1734962614.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

Yet that hasn’t stopped the Latin American country falling in love with a creamy liqueur traditionally associated with cold Christmas nights.

Although Baileys is called an Irish cream and its bottle suggests an authentic Irish origin, it was created in London by an advertising executive called Tom Jago, who also invented Malibu, the flavoured rum.

The original formulation is reported to have included Nesquik, the chocolate milkshake powder, and was developed in only 45 minutes.

It said that America was the biggest market, followed by the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Diageo said that Baileys was usually drunk with ice in the UK, with iced coffee in the US and in Germany it’s taken straight without a mixer.

How do you drink Baileys? Do you use it as a mixer?

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

One can't expect free Duolingo to be the same as Super Duolingo. The reality is Duolingo is a corporation with shareholders, computer engineers, and even free users cost them money, obviously. I said that and someone said ""Not all of us are rich"". $84 dollars per year is say the cost of 30 coffees in the US or Europe. In India, it's $50 per year. Anyway, Duolingo is still FREE. Yes, you have to use gems, or wait some hours or maybe watch an ad, and then you can replenish your hearts. People are angry that a private company ""punishes"" them for a mistake and are trying to make a profit, but they're ignoring that language apps aren't free whether it's Buusu, Memrise, Mondly, Lingodeer, or Babbel. With Babbel, Lingodeer, and Mondly you can pay for a lifetime membership, but they aren't free. 

I can understand people want Duolingo to give them unlimited hearts, but how would that be different than Super, then? Also, if one wants to take a language course at say the L'Alliance Francaise that can cost between $175-$350 dollars over two months based on the class. 

If Duolingo is now so horrible that someone's ranting that much, they can uninstall the app and learn for free on Youtube or do what is needed to replenish their hearts. I have a friend in Venezuela, a country with tons of poverty, he is limited by the hearts thing just like any free user, but he doesn't complain because he knows he can learn for free. He praises Duolingo, actually. ",1,1734962512.0,duolingo,0,1.0,False

It’s like being the wise sage on the digital mountain top, except you don’t have to wear a robe and sandals—or at least, no one will know if you do. Here’s a brainstorm of skills you could teach, platforms you can use, and some savvy marketing strategies to get those digital dollars flowing.

**Skills or Knowledge You Can Teach:**

1. **Baking for Beginners**: Simplifying baking techniques for those who just learned that FLOUR is not just for making a mess. Picture the joy and chaos of flour clouds everywhere!
   
2. **Personal Finance Basics**: Teach people how to budget without making their heads spin. You know, the “Buy Coffee Instead of Lattes” life hacks for those looking to save a buck.

3. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Guide students in navigating the chaotic waters of their busy lives. We’re talking about the “Breathing Through the Madness” masterclass.

4. **Creative Writing**: Help aspiring authors transform their inner monologues into best sellers... or at least something they’re proud to share without cringing.

5. **Digital Marketing Essentials**: Break down the jargon that makes people’s eyes glaze over faster than a donut in a pastry shop. 

6. **Gardening for Beginners**: Teaching how to not kill houseplants. The “It’s Not Me, It’s You” series for greenery.

7. **Fitness Classes**: Online workouts that promise not to involve running away from giant spiders or other scary beasts. 

**Platforms to Teach On:**

1. **Teachable**: Great for building your own brand, like constructing your personal fortress of knowledge for eager learners.

2. **Udemy**: More of a bustling marketplace filled with eager learners, like a digital farmer’s market but for information.

3. **Skillshare**: Perfect for creative and entrepreneurial types, offering a community vibe—like a coffee shop where everyone's passionately chatting about their projects.

4. **Kajabi**: A more premium platform that allows you to build an empire—think less farm stand, more castle.

5. **Thinkific**: A platform that’s super user-friendly—great for those who want a simple way to set up a course without feeling like they need an IT degree.

**Marketing Strategies for Pre-Selling Your Course:**

1. **Create Teaser Content**: Try offering free content related to your course. It’s like giving out free samples at the grocery store. People love free stuff!

2. **Build an Email List**: Start gathering emails before launching. Send out some fun newsletters—so much fun they’ll be exclaiming, “How did I get on this wild ride of awesomeness?”

3. **Leverage Social Media**: Use Instagram and TikTok to showcase quick tips related to your course. Everyone loves a good “two-minute hack,” especially when it’s all wrapped up in a captivating 15-second clip.

4. **Host Live Webinars**: Gather people for a free webinar where you share your knowledge, throw in a freebie, and gently nudge them toward your paid offering.

5. **Collaborate with Influencers**: Find influencers in your niche who can help share your course with their audience. It’s like teaming up for a superhero squad, except instead of capes, you're handing out knowledge.

6. **Utilize SEO**: Optimize your course description and promotional material for search engines. Help potential students find you when they're searching for knowledge—it's like being the lighthouse guiding lost ships home.

7. **Join Online Communities**: Engage with communities on platforms like Facebook or Reddit. Sharing insights and answering questions can position you as the go-to expert before you even launch your course.

-----------------------------

We've all seen that iconic image: a dog, head cocked inquisitively, perfectly framed by the triangular opening of an A-frame structure. It's a picture that speaks volumes about the simple joys of life, the connection between humans and their canine companions, and the undeniable charm of a well-placed architectural element. But the appeal of the ""A-frame dog"" goes far beyond a fleeting social media trend. It taps into something deeper, a yearning for cozy spaces, playful adventures, and the unwavering loyalty of our furry friends. This article delves into the phenomenon, exploring everything from the psychology behind the image to practical tips for capturing your own perfect A-frame dog photo. We'll discuss dog breeds that seem particularly suited to the A-frame life, DIY projects to create your own canine cabin, and even the burgeoning market of A-frame dog houses. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let's explore the delightful world of the A-frame dog!

### Why We Love the A-Frame Dog Aesthetic

Why does this image resonate so deeply? It's more than just a cute picture. The A-frame itself evokes a sense of shelter, security, and simplicity. It harkens back to childhood treehouses and cozy cabins nestled in the woods. When you add a dog to the mix, it amplifies those feelings of comfort and companionship. Dogs, after all, are masters of living in the moment, finding joy in the simplest things. Seeing them framed by the A-frame, seemingly content and curious, reminds us to appreciate the small pleasures in life. It’s a visual representation of hygge, that Danish concept of coziness and well-being. Think warm blankets, crackling fireplaces, and the happy sigh of a sleeping dog – that’s the essence of the A-frame dog aesthetic.

### A-Frame Dog: Best Breeds for the Cabin Life

Not all dogs are created equal when it comes to embracing the A-frame lifestyle. Some breeds are naturally drawn to the outdoors and thrive in rustic settings. Think about it: would a pampered chihuahua be as happy roughing it in a mountain cabin as a rugged Bernese Mountain Dog? Probably not. Here are a few breeds that seem particularly well-suited to the A-frame life:

- **Bernese Mountain Dog:** These gentle giants are built for the mountains. Their thick coats keep them warm in chilly weather, and their calm temperament makes them ideal cabin companions.
- **Golden Retriever:** Always up for an adventure, Golden Retrievers are happy to explore the woods, splash in the lake, and then curl up by the fire at the end of the day.
- **Siberian Husky:** While they might prefer a snow fort to a wooden cabin, Huskies embody the adventurous spirit of the A-frame lifestyle. They’re energetic, independent, and undeniably photogenic.
- **Australian Shepherd:** These intelligent and active dogs thrive on having a job to do, whether it's herding sheep or simply keeping an eye on their human companions. They’re adaptable and make excellent hiking buddies.

Of course, any dog can enjoy the A-frame experience, regardless of breed. It’s all about finding a dog that fits your lifestyle and sharing those special moments together.

### Building Your Own A-Frame Dog House

Want to give your furry friend their very own A-frame retreat? Building a miniature A-frame dog house is a fun and rewarding DIY project. You can find plenty of free plans online, ranging from simple designs to more elaborate structures. Here's what you need to consider:

1. **Size:** Measure your dog to ensure the house is large enough for them to comfortably stand, turn around, and lie down.
2. **Materials:** Choose weather-resistant materials like cedar or redwood to protect your dog from the elements.
3. **Insulation:** If you live in a cold climate, consider adding insulation to keep your dog warm in the winter.
4. **Ventilation:** Proper ventilation is essential to prevent moisture buildup and keep the air fresh inside the dog house.
5. **Location:** Place the dog house in a sheltered spot, away from strong winds and direct sunlight.

Building an A-frame dog house is a great way to show your love for your furry friend while adding a touch of rustic charm to your backyard. Imagine your own ""A-frame dog"" peering out from their personalized cabin – talk about a photo opportunity!

### Capturing the Perfect A-Frame Dog Photo

Getting that perfect shot of your A-frame dog isn’t always as easy as it looks. Here are a few tips to help you capture the magic:

- **Lighting:** Natural light is always best. Aim for soft, diffused light, such as early morning or late afternoon. Avoid harsh midday sun, which can create unflattering shadows.
- **Angle:** Experiment with different angles to find the most flattering perspective. Getting down low to the dog’s level often creates a more intimate and engaging image.
- **Treats and Toys:** Use treats or toys to capture your dog’s attention and encourage them to look towards the camera.
- **Patience:** Dogs aren’t always cooperative models. Be patient and persistent, and you’ll eventually get the perfect shot.
- **Editing:** Don’t be afraid to use editing software to enhance your photos. A little cropping, brightness adjustment, or color correction can go a long way.

It represents a connection to nature, a love of adventure, and the simple joy of spending time with your furry best friend. Whether you’re hiking in the mountains, relaxing by the lake, or simply cuddling up by the fire, your dog is always there, ready to share the moment.

It's a chance to reconnect with nature, breathe in the fresh air, and create lasting memories. Isn't that what life is all about? The A-frame dog image encapsulates this ideal, reminding us that sometimes, the best things in life are the simplest.

### The Rise of A-Frame Dog Products

1hkoc7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreshBreathChampion/comments/1hkoc7z/why_do_dogs_smell_bad_but_cats_dont_understanding/,Why Do Dogs Smell Bad But Cats Don't? Understanding Pet Odors and Care Tips,"Why Do Dogs Smell Bad but Cats Don't?
=====================================

When it comes to our furry companions, one question that often crosses the minds of pet owners is, ""Why do dogs smell bad but cats don't?"" It's a peculiar phenomenon that can leave many of us scratching our heads. After all, both animals are beloved members of our families, yet they come with strikingly different scents. In this article, we’ll delve deep into the reasons behind this olfactory disparity, exploring everything from anatomy and grooming habits to diet and overall health. We’ll also touch on how your dog's smell can affect your relationship with them. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s set off on this aromatic journey!

The Basics of Pet Odor
----------------------

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of why dogs tend to carry a more pungent odor than cats, it’s essential to understand a few basics about pet odor in general. Every living creature has a unique scent profile, influenced by factors like environment, diet, and health. Animals primarily use their sense of smell for communication, orientation, and even food selection. Interestingly enough, the way they smell can serve as an indicator of their well-being.

### The Anatomy of Smell: Dogs vs. Cats

One of the first things to consider when unraveling the mystery of pet odors is the anatomical differences between dogs and cats. Both species have an incredible sense of smell, but the way they process scents varies greatly.

- **Dogs** possess an impressive olfactory system with approximately 300 million scent receptors, compared to a mere 5 million in cats. This difference means that dogs can detect smells at incredibly low concentrations and can interpret various scents more thoroughly.
- **Cats**, on the other hand, while having fewer receptors, rely on their sense of smell primarily for survival and hunting. This lesser emphasis on scent detection may contribute to why they generally don’t carry the same strong odors as dogs.

So, when it comes to the question, ""Why do dogs smell bad but cats don't?"", one answer lies in their anatomical structure.

The Role of Glands in Dog Smell
-------------------------------

Moving on, let’s dive deeper into the physiological aspects of why dogs have that distinct odor. A significant contributor to the doggie smell is the sebaceous glands found in their skin. These tiny glands secrete oils that help maintain skin health and provide a waterproof barrier. However, these secretions can also play a role in body odor.

### Types of Glands

Here’s a brief rundown of the glands at play:

1. **Sebaceous Glands**: Found all over a dog’s body, these glands produce oily secretions that can trap dirt and bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors.
2. **Apocrine Glands**: These are sweat glands located mostly in the paws and areas where fur is sparse. When dogs sweat through these glands, they release a different type of scent, which can be particularly potent after physical activity.
3. **Anal Glands**: Often a conversation starter among dog owners, these glands produce a very strong-smelling fluid. When stressed or scared, dogs might excrete this fluid, contributing to their less-than-pleasant aroma.

Cats possess similar glands, but they’re not as prominent or as active as in dogs. Consequently, you usually won’t find the same level of odor emanating from your feline friend.

### Grooming Habits: The Real Game-Changer

You might think that any pet would give themselves regular grooming sessions. However, when comparing dogs and cats, you'll see a marked difference in their grooming behavior.

#### Cats Are Natural Groomers

Cats spend a considerable amount of their day grooming themselves. They often lick their fur, which not only helps remove dirt and debris but also redistributes natural oils, leading to a clean and pleasant scent. It’s almost like they’ve got their own cleaning service built right into their routine!

Conversely, while dogs do groom themselves, they simply don’t do it to the same extent. Plus, their grooming habits vary dramatically based on breed.

#### Dogs and Their Love for the Outdoors

To add another layer to this, dogs simply love to roll around in grass, mud, and who knows what else! This adventurous behavior can lead to them picking up odors from their environment, which contributes to that undeniable “dog smell.” If you've got a pup that loves the outdoors, you might want to invest in some high-quality dog shampoo.

Diet: What Goes In Must Come Out
--------------------------------

Another crucial element to consider is diet. Ever noticed how something as simple as what your pet eats can significantly influence their smell?

### What Are They Eating?

The saying holds true: You are what you eat! If your dog is consuming low-quality food or indulging in table scraps, the result can be a more pungent aroma. Foods rich in fats and certain proteins can lead to oilier skin, which can exacerbate odor.

On the flip side, most commercial cat foods are designed to balance out a cat’s specific dietary needs. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their diets are primarily protein-based. This difference often results in less digestive disruption and, consequently, a less pronounced odor.

### The Impact of Sensitive Stomachs

Let’s not forget that some dogs might have sensitive stomachs or allergies that can lead to gastrointestinal upset. If your dog's tummy isn’t happy, it can sometimes result in notable odors. Keeping an eye on diet and making adjustments as necessary can lead to improvements in more ways than one!

Health Issues: A Deeper Dive
----------------------------

Sometimes, a foul smell might hint at underlying health issues. When pondering, ""Why do dogs smell bad but cats don't?"", it’s essential to consider the health factors that could contribute to unpleasant odors.

### Skin Infections and Allergies

Dogs are particularly prone to skin infections and allergies due to their increased oil production and skin folds (especially in breeds like Bulldogs). Infected skin can become a breeding ground for bacteria, resulting in a smell that could knock you off your feet! Regular veterinary check-ups can help catch these issues early.

### Dental Health

Ever heard of “dog breath”? Just like humans, dogs can suffer from dental problems that lead to foul-smelling breath. Plaque buildup can cause periodontal disease, leading to infections that produce a distinctly unpleasant odor. Regular teeth cleanings can help keep your dog's mouth in tip-top shape!

### Digestive Issues

Digestive trouble can also manifest in smell. If your dog experiences gas or has an upset stomach, the smell can linger. Keeping a watchful eye on their digestive health can make a big difference. If things seem off, it’s wise to consult your vet.

Bath Time Blues: A Necessary Evil
---------------------------------

Let’s face it; most dogs aren’t huge fans of bath time. But regular bathing can drastically reduce that infamous dog odor.

### Frequency of Baths

How often should you bathe your dog? Well, it depends on several factors, including breed, activity level, and whether they have skin conditions. Generally speaking:

- **Short-haired breeds**: May only require baths every few months.
- **Long-haired breeds**: Might need more frequent baths and brushing to manage dirt and odor.
- **Active dogs**: Those that love rolling around outside? They will likely need more regular baths to keep the smell at bay.

It's also a good idea to use a shampoo specifically formulated for dogs, as human shampoo can strip their coats of necessary oils and lead to even more skin issues.

### Make Bathing Fun

If your dog views bath time as a punishment, try making it a positive experience. Use treats, praise, and perhaps even some favorite toys to create a sense of joy rather than dread. A dog that enjoys their bath will naturally be cleaner and smell better!

Personal Care: Grooming Beyond the Bath
---------------------------------------

While bathing is critical, it’s essential to emphasize regular grooming. Brushing not only eliminates excess fur but also removes dirt, dander, and allergens, contributing to a fresher-smelling dog.

### Invest in Quality Grooming Tools

Having the right tools can make all the difference. Look for grooming brushes tailored to your dog’s coat type. Regular grooming sessions can turn into a bonding activity, enhancing the relationship you have with your beloved pet while keeping their scent in check.

Addressing the Question: Why Do Dogs Smell Bad but Cats Don’t?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we’ve delved into various aspects of dog odors, it's clear that a combination of factors plays into why dogs tend to smell worse than cats. From their biology and grooming habits to diet and health, there’s a plethora of reasons behind the scent disparities between these two popular pets.

### Final Thoughts on Dog Odor

It’s important to remember that, despite their sometimes funky smells, dogs are incredibly loyal companions who bring joy to our lives. With proper care, attention to hygiene, and regular vet check-ups, you can manage and minimize those odors effectively.

As the old saying goes, ""A dog is a man’s best friend,"" and thankfully, there's plenty we can do to ensure that friendship remains as sweet-smelling as possible!

I'm having a hard time trying to get my coffee right. Hoping someone can help out.

The problems I have are:

\- Long extraction time and low yield (brewing for 30s gives me only 29g for 18g of beans)

\- Puck that doesn't come out unless if I use a chopstick to dig at it

I don't have my own space yet so I can't get myself a proper espresso machine, until 2 years later when my place would be ready. The Outin Nano is a birthday present.

I am using the Kingrinder K6 to grind my beans. The beans I'm using are labelled as medium-dark roast, and are roasted on 19th Dec so still pretty fresh. I preheat the machine by running it on hot water only while I grind my beans.

I use 18g beans (using the plus basket), grind them on 40 clicks, and am only able to get around 26g after 30s brew time. I'm being told that I should get 36g within 25 to 30s.

Also the puck is always a bit soupy on top. If I pour the top soup away, the puck doesn't come out even if I knock at it really hard. I always have to use a chopstick or spoon so scoop the grinds out little by little.

Here are the parameters I have played with:

1. Grind at 35 clicks - only a trickle comes out, so that was too fine for the machine to handle
2. Grind at 40 clicks and letting it run until 36g yield - coffee was too bitter, so I guess it's overextracted
3. Grind at 40 clicks and stopping at 30s which results in only 27g yield - coffee tastes alright I guess but lacks a bit of body imo

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1734961831.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Should I be concerned?,"So I take Lexapro 10mg and just added Wellbutrin to the mix. I’ve never been the type of person to pay much attention to food, but I didn’t have the best diet. Mainly cause I ate meals and still snacked a lot. It never bothered me though and I wasn’t worried about changing my eating habits (I’m a healthy weight). But I’ve noticed the past two weeks that I’ve barely been able to eat at all. I wake up and can barely finish my coffee. I haven’t gotten any real hunger pangs and I can’t finish big meals that well. The biggest thing that made me aware of this new struggle to eat is that yesterday I laid down for bed after work and realized that I hadn’t eaten anything all day. I wake up at 6am and work till 4pm. I laid down at 9pm. That ENTIRE time I had nothing but coffee, water, and I think some diet soda. And I didn’t notice any hunger or real difference…

Should I be concerned about this? Should I tell my doctor? I’ve actually really liked the mental effects of Wellbutrin. I’ve felt a bit more motivated already. But this side effect I wasn’t expecting. Will it go away? Is this normal?

I am looking to recreate a shirt of my favorite childhood hockey brand (which is no longer in business). I've gotten close to the logo to send to a custom shirt company, but need some help getting it across the line.

Can someone edit the logo I made to:

a) clean up the pixelation

b) round the corners of the outer square to match the example

c) add a light level of distress similar to the example (does NOT have to be a match, just trying to get the same concept).

The final image should be white on a transparent background so I can send to a shirt company and print on a black shirt without issues. Thank you so much! Will send coffee money or more if the task is deemed more challenging.

Over the past several years, my epilepsy, perhaps out of pity for my tongue, seemingly has targeted my teeth; multiple TCs have resulted in chipped or broken teeth, with several being entirely knocked out in the process. I am not a wealthy person (I am entirely disabled), and I do not have dental insurance, so I have sort of just had to make do. 

Last night, I seized (a focal), and made the mistake of trying to stand up too soon after the experience. I experienced some sort of rapid change in my blood pressure that caused me to feel rather weak and I pitched forward onto the coffee table, breaking two front teeth nearly in half. 

I am only 55, and I think I am going to have to get dentures, bc this just looks atrocious… 😞 I know that I am extremely fortunate to be alive after the injuries I suffered that led to my epilepsy, and I try to live each day in gratitude. I am grateful to be alive, I am grateful to be in good health, and I am grateful for my children who have grown into beautiful adults. But, I am not grateful for my teeth right now.

Of my core group of friends, 4 out of 6 now have kids, totaling 6 children between them, soon-to-be 7.

I usually get the kids each something small. Stickers last year, mini stuffies this year. It’s the holidays and they are coming to my house, it’s like a little goody bag and I enjoy seeing them happy. I make an effort to have kid-friendly food (I cook an elaborate dinner, I enjoy doing this, and understand not every kid wants spicy lamb ragu) and move the major kid dangers (e.g. heavy stone coffee table, vases, etc.)

The last two years, three friends have started bringing gifts for all the kids to the party. One friend also brings gifts for my two dogs, but the others don’t.

I feel weird about it. It’s my house, and no one asked if they could do gifts for the kids, they just started doing it. And ok, it’s innocuous, but it’s not sitting right with me, especially when two friends get nothing for my dogs or me and my partner.

I’m getting married next year, a smallish wedding, and invited all the kids, because I know my friends would prefer them there and I truly don’t mind, I think kids are cute and sweet and it does make me happy to see them having fun . Not only that, but I’ve asked all the kids coming to be my flower children. I was going to ask most anyway (niece, nephew, and my bridesmaids kids), but then was feeling bad that more than half the 13 children invited were in the wedding so decided to include them all. The parents are all thrilled and excited and the older girls who understand incredibly excited. I’m getting their dresses and suits and my fiancé, a Lego enthusiast, and I have already bought each kid a Lego set (thoughtfully-purchased based on their age and interests) as thank you gifts for them (and as entertainment during the wedding if they get bored and want to retreat to the kids room that will have baby sitters we’ve hired).

In short, I feel like I’m really thoughtful when it comes to the kids and when it comes to how I know the parents want their kids treated and included. I don’t expect the SAME back, but I’d like some level of reciprocation or acknowledgement. Like, ASK if you can have a kids’ gift exchange at MY party, instead of assuming and then not including the humans or animals that live at the house you just had an amazing dinner at.

We have planned not to have kids, and I suppose I have to accept this is how it will be, with less thought given to us because we don’t have kids, or simply stop thinking of the kids so much, but I do feel sad and disappointed.",3,1734960514.0,childfree,2,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. You may often wonder, “how much water should I drink in a day?” Your daily water intake plays a significant role in your overall well-being. Here are ten compelling reasons why understanding your water needs is vital for living a healthier life.

### 1. Regulates Body Temperature

Your body is composed of about 60% water. This fluid aids in regulating your body temperature. When you're active or when it's hot outside, sweating helps cool your body down. Sufficient water intake keeps this process efficient, preventing overheating.

### 2. Supports Digestive Health

Water is essential for digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients and soluble fiber, allowing them to pass smoothly through your digestive system. Drinking enough water can prevent constipation and ensure that your body absorbs the nutrients it needs.

### 3. Enhances Physical Performance

Whether you're hitting the gym or enjoying a leisurely walk, staying hydrated is key to optimal physical performance. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, reduced endurance, and muscle cramps. Knowing how much water you should drink can improve your workouts and help you perform at your best.

### 4. Boosts Brain Function

Your brain relies on water to function efficiently. Even mild dehydration can affect your concentration, alertness, and short-term memory. Keeping hydrated helps maintain clarity of thought and cognitive performance, allowing you to tackle tasks with ease.

### 5. Aids in Weight Management

If you're looking to manage your weight, drinking water can be beneficial. Water has no calories, making it an excellent substitute for sugary drinks. Additionally, sometimes hunger can mask itself as thirst; drinking water can help you distinguish between the two. Staying hydrated may reduce your appetite and encourage healthy eating habits.

### 6. Promotes Healthy Skin

Water plays a crucial role in keeping your skin healthy and radiant. Proper hydration helps maintain your skin's elasticity and flushes out toxins, reducing the chances of acne and blemishes. Drinking enough water contributes to a youthful appearance and keeps your skin looking its best.

### 7. Supports Kidney Function

Your kidneys filter waste from your blood, and adequate hydration is vital for this process. Drinking enough water helps to dilute waste substances and enables your kidneys to function efficiently. Proper hydration can also prevent kidney stones and other complications.

### 8. Improves Mood

Dehydration can lead to irritability, anxiety, and mood swings. By understanding how much water you should drink daily, you can positively impact your mood. Staying hydrated can reduce feelings of fatigue and stress, leading to a more balanced emotional state.

### 9. Enhances Immune Function

Your immune system needs water to function effectively. Hydration helps the body to produce lymph, which is essential for a healthy immune system. Drinking enough water can assist your body in fighting off illnesses and makes recovering from sickness easier.

### 10. Supports Joint Health

Water is crucial for lubricating joints. It helps maintain cushioning around your joints, reducing discomfort during movement. Staying hydrated can protect your joints from wear and tear, especially if you're physically active or aging.

To wrap it all up, staying informed about how much water you should drink in a day is a simple yet effective step towards improving your overall health. A common guideline suggests aiming for about eight 8-ounce glasses—usually referred to as the “8x8 rule”—but individual needs can vary. Factors like age, activity level, and climate conditions influence how much water your body truly requires.

Remember, listen to your body. Thirst is a natural cue that indicates you need to drink. Keep a water bottle handy, make it a habit, and watch how hydration impacts your life. Empower yourself with this knowledge and incorporate it into your daily routine for a healthier, happier you.

The Impact of Hydration on Physical Performance
-----------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is a fundamental aspect of maintaining good health, especially when it comes to physical performance. Water plays a vital role in various body functions, and understanding its impact can greatly benefit anyone looking to enhance their fitness level.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
When you think about your performance during sports or workouts, hydration is often not the first thing that comes to mind. However, proper hydration can significantly affect endurance, strength, and recovery. Here are some key points about the impact of hydration on physical performance:

### 1. Enhances Endurance

One of the most crucial benefits of staying hydrated is enhanced endurance. When participating in prolonged physical activities, your body loses water through sweating. Water is essential for maintaining fluid balance and temperature regulation. Without adequate hydration, you are more likely to experience fatigue, leading to reduced stamina during exercise.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 2. Improves Strength

Hydration influences muscular strength. Muscles are composed of about 75% water. Therefore, insufficient water intake can lead to muscle cramps and reduced strength during workouts. Ensuring that you drink enough water helps maintain muscle function and allows for optimal performance during weightlifting or strength training sessions.

### 3. Affects Cognitive Function

Physical performance doesn’t just rely on muscle strength; it also depends on cognitive abilities such as focus and decision-making. Dehydration can lead to decreased mental clarity and concentration, affecting how you perform in sports that require quick thinking and strategic play. Drinking enough water can keep your mind sharp and responsive.

### 4. Supports Joint and Tissue Health

Water lubricates joints, which is crucial for anyone engaged in physical activities. Proper hydration helps reduce the risk of injuries by protecting joints and cushioning tissues. This means a lower chance of strains or sprains during intense workout sessions.

### 5. Enhances Recovery

After an intense workout, your body needs to recover. Hydration can significantly speed up the recovery process. Drinking water aids in nutrient delivery to cells and assists in removing metabolic waste. This means that properly hydrating can help you bounce back quicker, allowing you to train harder and more frequently.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 6. Regulates Body Temperature

During exercise, your body temperature rises. Drinking enough water helps regulate body temperature by allowing sweat to evaporate, which cools you down. Without adequate hydration, your body struggles to cool itself, leading to overheating. This can negatively impact performance and even lead to heat-related illnesses.

### 7. Aids Metabolism

Hydration plays a role in your metabolism and, subsequently, energy levels. When your body lacks hydration, it can slow down metabolic processes, making it difficult to use energy efficiently during workouts. Maintaining hydration keeps your metabolism running smoothly, providing you with the energy needed to perform well.

### 8. Increases Nutrient Absorption

Water is crucial for the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Proper hydration ensures that your body efficiently breaks down food and utilizes vitamins and minerals essential for optimal performance. This means that being well-hydrated can enhance not just exercise performance, but overall health and well-being.

### 9. Prevents Dehydration Symptoms

Dehydration can lead to multiple symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, confusion, and dry mouth. These unpleasant effects can hinder your performance and motivation to work out. By drinking enough water throughout the day, you can prevent dehydration and its detrimental effects.

### 10. Encourages Healthy Habits

Maintaining adequate hydration can help cultivate a healthy lifestyle. When you start to prioritize water intake, you become more mindful of your health overall. This added awareness often translates into better nutrition, regular exercise, and improved self-care practices.

A habit of drinking enough water before, during, and after physical activities can significantly enhance your performance and recovery. Pay attention to your body’s signals, and make hydration a regular part of your fitness routine. Whether you’re a competitive athlete or just enjoy being active, remembering the important role hydration plays can help you reach your performance goals more effectively.

Common Myths About Water Intake Debunked
----------------------------------------

When it comes to staying hydrated, there are many beliefs about water intake floating around. Some of these notions are true, while others need a closer look. It’s time to debunk some common myths you might have heard about how much water you should drink every day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: Everyone Needs Eight Glasses of Water a Day

While the ""eight glasses a day"" rule is popular, hydration needs vary based on several factors. Age, sex, activity level, and climate can all influence how much water you really need. Some individuals may thrive on less, while others may require more. Listen to your body; thirst is a good indicator!

### Myth 2: You Can Get Enough Water from Food Alone

Food does contribute to your daily water intake, especially fruits and veggies. However, relying solely on food can leave you short of your hydration goals. Foods typically account for about 20% of your daily water needs, making it essential to drink water as well.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 3: You Should Drink Water Even When You’re Not Thirsty

Feeling thirsty is your body's way of signaling that you need to hydrate. For most people, drinking water when you’re thirsty is enough. Overhydrating can lead to a rare but serious condition known as hyponatremia, where sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low.

### Myth 4: Drinking Excess Water Will Boost Your Metabolism

While staying hydrated is crucial for your body’s functions, drinking excessive amounts of water will not significantly increase your metabolism. A moderate increase in metabolic rate can occur right after drinking cold water, but this effect is minimal in the long run.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 5: Caffeinated Drinks Don't Count Towards Hydration

Many people believe that caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea will dehydrate you. While it's true that caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, moderate consumption does contribute to your daily hydration needs. Enjoy your coffee guilt-free—just remember to drink water too.

### Myth 6: Only Drink Water When You Exercise

Some may think hydration is only necessary during workouts, but your body needs water throughout the day. Regular hydration helps with digestion, circulation, and even temperature regulation. Make a habit of drinking water frequently, not just when you’re active.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 7: You Can't Overhydrate

While most people are more concerned about dehydration, overhydration is possible. Drinking too much water can lead to an electrolyte imbalance, which can cause confusion, nausea, and muscle weakness. Be mindful of your intake, especially during endurance activities.

### Myth 8: Drinking Water Can Negate the Effects of Alcohol

Some argue that drinking water can counteract alcohol's dehydrating effects, but this isn't entirely true. While drinking water can help you feel better during a hangover, it won't prevent intoxication or dehydration caused by alcohol consumption. Moderation is key when it comes to drinking.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 9: The Color of Your Urine Doesn’t Matter

Actually, the color of your urine can be a very telling sign of your hydration level. Clear or pale yellow urine typically indicates good hydration, while dark yellow or amber suggests that you need to drink more water. Use this as a guideline to adjust your intake.

### Myth 10: Bottled Water is Always the Best Choice

While bottled water seems convenient, it’s not necessarily better than tap water. In many places, tap water is just as safe and can be a more environmentally friendly option. Check your local water quality reports to ensure your tap water is safe and clean.

Wading through these myths can help you better understand your hydration needs. Remember, the best approach to maintaining proper hydration is to listen to your body. It will let you know what it needs, whether that’s a refreshing glass of water or a juicy piece of fruit. Stay informed, stay hydrated!

Strategies to Increase Your Daily Water Consumption
---------------------------------------------------

Water is critical for maintaining your health and well-being. However, many people struggle to consume enough throughout the day. Here are some strategies to help you boost your daily water intake effortlessly.

### Set Daily Goals

One effective way to increase your water consumption is by setting clear goals. Aim for a specific amount of water to drink by the end of the day. For instance, you might decide on eight 8-ounce glasses, which equals about 2 liters. Use this target to motivate yourself and track your progress. You can check off each glass you drink to visualize your achievement.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Use a Water Bottle

Investing in a reusable water bottle can significantly encourage you to drink more water. Choose a bottle that you enjoy using and can carry with you everywhere. Fill it up in the morning and aim to finish it by the time you get home. Having water within reach makes it easier to sip throughout the day.

### Set Reminders

Sometimes, you're just too busy to remember to drink water. Setting reminders on your phone or using apps specifically designed to remind you to hydrate can prove beneficial. You can schedule notifications every hour, prompting you to take a few sips. Over time, this habit will start to feel more natural.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Flavor Your Water

Plain water can become monotonous, leading to a lack of interest in drinking it. Jazz things up by infusing your water with fruits, herbs, or vegetables. Consider combinations like:

- Lemon and mint
- Cucumber and lime
- Strawberries and basil

These flavor boosters not only make water more enjoyable but add nutrients too, enhancing your daily hydration experience.

### Incorporate Water-Rich Foods

Eating foods with high water content is another fantastic way to increase hydration. Include fruits and veggies such as:

- Watermelon
- Cucumbers
- Oranges
- Celery

These items not only quench your thirst but also contribute to your overall daily water intake.

### Drink Before Meals

To form a habit, make it a point to drink a glass of water before each meal. This simple action can help you stay hydrated and also support digestion. It can also prevent overeating by making you feel fuller, which is an added bonus for those managing their weight.

### Replace Other Beverages

If you're accustomed to drinking sugary sodas or coffee, consider substituting them with water or sparkling water. Reducing your intake of high-calorie drinks is a smart move for your health while also promoting a higher water consumption. You can enjoy flavored sparkling water for a fizzy alternative without the added sugar.

### Track Your Intake

Using mobile apps or a simple journal to monitor how much water you drink can help raise awareness and keep you accountable. Seeing your progress can motivate you to keep going. Aim to log each glass you consume and observe how it adds up throughout the day.

### Enlist a Hydration Buddy

Sometimes, motivation is more accessible with a friend. Find a hydration buddy who has the same goal of drinking more water. Encourage each other, share tips, and celebrate each other's progress. Having a partner can make the process enjoyable and increase your commitment to staying hydrated.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Start Your Day with Water

Another quick strategy is to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning. After a long night's rest, your body may be dehydrated. Starting your day with water will set a positive tone for hydration, motivating you to continue drinking throughout the day.

By implementing these strategies, you can effortlessly increase your daily water consumption. Your body will thank you, leading to better health, improved energy levels, and a significant boost in your overall well-being. Remember to find what works best for you, and hydrate for a healthier life!

The Role of Hydration in Preventing Chronic Diseases
----------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your overall health and well-being. You might wonder how much water should you drink in a day? Understanding hydration is crucial, especially when it comes to preventing chronic diseases. Here are some essential insights into the role of hydration in maintaining your health.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Why Hydration Matters

Water makes up a significant portion of your body. It aids in digestion, regulates body temperature, and helps transport nutrients. A well-hydrated body can function better, which means your organs can work optimally, and you're less likely to face health issues.

### How Hydration Affects Chronic Disease Risk

When you think about chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, hydration plays a pivotal role in prevention. Let’s explore ten key reasons why staying hydrated is essential in fighting these conditions:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
1. **Regulates Blood Sugar Levels:** Staying hydrated helps your body utilize insulin more effectively, thus maintaining stable blood sugar levels, which is crucial for preventing type 2 diabetes.
2. **Supports Heart Health:** Proper hydration is necessary for maintaining blood volume and circulation. When your body is well-hydrated, your heart doesn’t have to work as hard.
3. **Aids Weight Management:** Drinking water can help control your appetite. Sometimes, your body confuses thirst with hunger, leading to overeating. A glass of water might be all you need instead of an extra snack.
4. **Improves Digestion:** Hydration ensures that your digestive system works efficiently. Water helps break down food so that your body can absorb nutrients, reducing the risk of digestive diseases.
5. **Flushes Out Toxins:** Drinking enough water supports kidney function, allowing your body to filter and eliminate waste effectively. Less strain on your kidneys means a lower risk of kidney disease.
6. **Enhances Brain Function:** Dehydration can lead to cognitive decline. Keeping hydrated helps maintain sharp memory and mental clarity, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
7. **Boosts Immune Function:** Adequate hydration helps your body fight off infections more efficiently. A well-hydrated person is less likely to fall ill, reducing chronic disease risk.
8. **Prevents Joint Pain:** Water acts as a lubricant for your joints. Staying hydrated means reducing discomfort in joints, which can prevent arthritis and other joint diseases over time.
9. **Promotes Healthy Skin:** Hydration is crucial for skin health as well. Drinking enough water can prevent skin conditions and keep your skin looking youthful and vibrant.
10. **Reduces Inflammation:** Chronic inflammation is linked to many diseases. Staying hydrated helps lower inflammation levels in the body, which may decrease the risk of conditions like heart disease and certain cancers.

### Daily Hydration Tips

Now that you understand how hydration prevents chronic diseases, making a conscious effort to drink enough water daily is essential. Here are some practical tips:

- Start your day by drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning.
- Keep a reusable water bottle with you to track your intake.
- Set reminders on your phone to take a water break every hour.
- Incorporate hydrating foods into your diet – fruits and vegetables are great sources.
- If you find plain water boring, add slices of lemon, cucumber, or mint for flavor.

### Listening to Your Body

Your body often sends signals to indicate when it needs hydration. Pay attention to signs like thirst, dry mouth, headaches, or fatigue. You can adjust your water intake based on your physical activity, climate, and dietary choices.

You deserve to feel good and thrive. Make hydration a priority, and enjoy the benefits it offers to your body and mind.

We got reservations through the waitlist since our preferred time was full  and were notified about 2 weeks prior to the desired date that they would have a table for us. Since the main dining room was full, the way they accommodated us off of the waitlist was to put us into a semi-private side room. Honestly, I think this just added to the experience since it was beautifully decorated and we did not feel like an afterthought in any way whatsoever. We also really appreciated that they managed to fit us in despite being fully booked!

We took the ""Fragonard Menu"" for the entire table - which is the set menu for 128 EUR per person. You can also order a la carte. We also took a wine pairing of 3 glasses for 60 EUR each. The menu was as follows:

\- Two amuses (not pictured): One was a pastry cone filled with orange / sweet potato puree and the other was a pastry pillow filled with a tarte flambee cream and topped with a small lardon. Both were tasty, but not incredibly special.

\- Appetizer (picture 1): Chestnut soup with pumpkin. Very taste and seasonal. Beautiful presentation; chef plated it in front of us.

\- Course #1 (picture 2): Foie gras 2-ways. Two separate dishes served together - but I only took a picture of one dish. One plating was the foie gras ravioli with onion jam, onion cream, and roasted onions. The other plating was a pan seared foie gras topped with a black truffle gelee. Both were delicious, but the ravioli in particular were fantastic and perfectly balanced

\- Course #2 (picture 3): Pike perch with crispy bacon/potatoes and riesling sauce. Another excellent course. The fish was stuffed with sauerkraut and topped with a light horseradish cream. Every single component worked well together and individually.

\- Course #3 (picture 4): Scallops 2-ways. Two seaprate dishes served together. The larger plate was a pan-seared scallop with different preparation of cauliflower in a mussel, orange, and vanilla sauce. This was our favorite dish of the evening -- the flavors were potent, balanced, and quite unique. The other plating was a scallop crudo that was fine, but not really memorable.

\- Course #4 (picture 5): Venison 2-ways. Two separate dishes served one after another. The first part of the course (not pictured) was a 12 hour slow cooked venison stew that was simple in flavor profile, but delicious nonetheless. The second part was the filet with a blackberry sauce and a crispy potato pastry filled with potato puree. Despite not being the most creative dish, it was perfectly executed and quite delicious. Pairing with a pinot noir from a couple villages over was best of the night as well.

\- Course #5 (pictures 6 and 7): We took two separate desserts and split them. One was an apple / cinnamon mille-feiulle with a creme brulee ice cream. The second was a chocolate hazelnut praline with a coffee ice cream. Pretty classic flavors, but again beautifully executed and incredibly tasty.

\- Mignardises (picture 8): Chocolate/cherry, chestnut/mandarin, coconut/cinnamon. Very punchy, no faults. We also got espressos afterwards and were served 3 truffles (basil/white chocolate, caramel/milk chocolate, and hazelnut/dark chocolate).

\- Wine pairing: Generous pours, very knowledgeable sommelier, and paired perfectly with the intended courses. I can't remember specifics, but it is was 2 white wines (one from Loire, another from SW France) and 1 pinot noir (from Alsace). It wasn't the best pairing ever, but we felt for 60 EUR it was a fair value.

\- Service: Excellent all night. Attentive, but not overbearing. The chef himself attended to our table for multiple courses. The sommelier was a standout as well, even beyond the wine.

Overall verdict: For 188 EUR including wine, we felt this was a very good value for a 4-hour experience in a 1\* restaurant. There were three excellent courses (foie gras, pike perch, and scallops) and two very good courses. Although it wasn't the most creative meal in the world, everything was perfectly executed and we were still surprised by unusual flavor combinations for some of the courses. I would rank this near the top of the 1\* Michelin we have visited, and also above a couple 2\* restaurants.

I take Taurine with my coffee 2000mg every morning (not sure if this helped) but I use to have h.pylori in the past. Digestive enzymes twice to once a day to ease digestion and I had no digestive symptoms tapering down. 

It has been a week since my last dosage and so far so good. Hope this helped.

One of the most basic tools that was provided to me that I was expected to use was a shift book- it was very simple. It notes from the previous supervisor on duty that may be helpful to the next supervisor on duty. You reviewed it before your shift and made notes of anything significant or deviations from policy that the next person running the store may find helpful. 

As I progressed through my various odd jobs at coffee shops, retail, political campaigns, etc, some version of this tool has existed at every job in some form. 

Long story longer- why is this such a foreign concept at the USPS? I can’t tell you how many times the evening Supe and I align on a plan for something, and then the next day the morning Supe had undoubtedly fucked it up to high heaven. The morning Supe had no idea, the evening Supe didn’t leave a note or say anything. 

I can’t believe that in all the upper echelons of leadership no one has heard of … a notebook. So I guess I have to come to the conclusion that such gross incompetence and idiocy is simply a choice.

1hknfwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hikikomori/comments/1hknfwc/some_good_news_about_my_life_trajectory/,Some good news about my life trajectory,"I am the girl who posted about desperately wanting to get out of NEETdom soon, and I've come back with some good news. (I am supposed to be on a social media hiatus right now, but I'll make an exception for this Reddit).

I have started coming out of my behavioral rut and I've been using technology less for consuming mindless content and more for learning and education, I've made a bunch of playlists on music theory and art fundamentals, etc.

I am an unemployed adult so I have the entire day to myself to dedicate myself to learning the things I care about, so I have started doing just that, I've been gradually getting back into it. 

My diet is getting better, though I'm slacking a bit during the holidays, I no longer eat fried crap every other day, and I haven't had  single energy drink since June. I've replaced most of my energy drink and coffee intake with tea, both with caffeine and chamomile or passionflower. It seems I have a new addiction.

I've been intercting more with life, with hobbies, and I am signing up for an amateur musical theatre group for disabled folk (mild autism and potential TBI counts apparently), and I have also been listeningn to more diverse genres of music, and  music from different parts of the world, and also been reading more fiction, like manhwa, novels, classic literature, poetry, japanese manga, you name it, people say it's a waste of time but I find it very enriching and therapeutic. I'm currently reading a webcomic called ''Little Hollow Cafe'', it's about this girl who moves to this small remote town to run her late grandmother's coffee shop and as someone who grew up with grandparents and also spent a lot of time in a small greek town as a kid I find it very touching and enriching. I actually reccomend it.

From tommorrow onwards I plan to start exercising again, (today I showered), and this afternoon I am going to start meditating for an hour or two a day like I used to in high school and last summer. 

I take breaks every fiftyish minutes when I practice my instrument(s) (all strings, lol), to prevent burnout and generally try to have balance and not grind myself to death. I am watching an anime called Blue Period, it's about this high school kid discovering fine arts last minute a little before his graduation, and trying to catch up with other kids in his year who have been practicing for longer, and while I don't think it  make sense for a painter to feel that way since historically and even today most fine artists tend to pick up painting a little bit older (high school  -college - career aged), I can see how a musician, especially classical would feel that way, since prodigies are such a big deal in classical music and many teachers have the limiting belief that unless you have composed entire symphony's by your 10th year alive and have enormous fingers you are screwed and should just learn to code bro, and you're a hopeless case. I can see myself in Yatura (the main character), and we have the same feelings of deep ambition and drive to improve and succeed. I like how a lot of anime revolves around a main character who wants to be great at something and then achieves this through diligence and perseverance, like a super low level mage gradually leveling up and soon becoming extremely powwerful through their own efforts, or  kid in high school who has something they're extremely passionate about and want to someday become great at, like a sport or art form. I like how a lot of anime and manga explores themes like wanting to achieve greatness in something, ambition, and hard work vs natural talent.

A lot of people here talk about how desperately they want to change but can't, and a month ago I used to be one of them, but I think it all boils down to that, Desire: Ambition is essentially a desire to work hard and achieve greatness in something, or make a significant advancement in your life. People seem to associate the word ambition with delusions of grandeur, like someone with no entrepreebeurial spirit or gift in innovation wanting to be a gazillionire and live in a massive mcmansion, or a young girl who is convinced she's going to be the next Taylor Swift, despite showing no outstanding potential in songwriting and having no marketing skills or connections to the industry, but I think ambition does not have to be huge, and it is also different for everyone. I think that is what is pulling me out of my rut, desire, and ambition, it all boils down to Desire, whether there is something in life that you crave more than the distractions or old habits that weigh you down, whether you crave to change your life more than you crave to remain stagnant and live the same day on repeat. And I think a lot of people here don't have that, or don't really know what they want from life and as a result do not have a Desire stronger than their habitual desire to stay the same and re-live the same day over and over again. And that is what is weighing them down.

I am happy to announce that I have been accepted into an art college, and lessons are three times a week, one time remotely. I am also working on my conservatory exams, though in Greece that is a part time thing, lessons are once or twice a week, and you're expected to do most of the practicing alone. As a result many music students also go to a regular university. (We don't have major music schools like Julliard, here it's just an afterschool thing, - that is what  makes it so easy for complete beginners to break into it even if they have never touched an instrument as a child. Here programs take anyone even with no experience, and are more like 1 - 1 apprenticeships rather than American type colleges, so there is less room for comparison, and feeling behind, as a result it is easier for older people to break into this field, even with no experience.) I also feel like greek people are lacking in work ethic, so it is easy to outshine even the ''veteran'' learners, - speaking from experience most of them barely practice 90 minutes a day. 

Enough about me, here is my advice for how to get out of Hikikomori-dom/NEETdom, slowly but steadily. Keep in mind that I'm 19 and don't know shit, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt.

**1.Find your ''Ambition''**

*Ambition is a very strong word,* but a lot of people don't know that it does not have to be something huge and extremely unattainable, it can be something as reasonable and realistic as getting into a good college, getting good grades,  and getting a high paying job so you can someday afford to have a family and offer your children a good life. Ambition has very negtive connotations as a word, people think it always means wanting to be extremely rich or extremely famous, but I think that view is misguided, I think ambition can also be realistic anc grounded in reality, I think a person who wants to be a pediatric surgeon and save lives someday is ambitious, similarly, I think a musician who wants to work hard at their craft with the goal of making beautiful art that will give people something to live for someday is also ''ambitious''. Ambition can be whatever you want it to be, and it is what will pull you out of your rut, simply because your Desire to get to whatever aim you've put your mind to will be stronger than the desire to remain the same.

**2. Either extremely restrict technology or learn to coexist with it**

I have found that the biggest constraint in my recovery from Hikiomori-dom/NEETdom was technology. So my plan was pretty straightforward, restrict it's use as much as possible for as long as possible, and focus on my goals. However, I have found that this does not work long term, especiailly for me and in this day and age. Recently I have fallen in love with digital art and I am realizing that I have never hd healthy, moderate relationship with technology, and I have almost never used it in a non-addictive, creative way. I find that as artist in 2024 a lot of contract work but also salaried positions in companies are entirely digital, and I need to know how to work using digital software and apps if I want to get clients with ease. It's also possible to find analog jobs but these are mostly in kidslit illustration, the style of which I find extremely cutesy and restrictive. 

So, my advice to you is, if your lifestyle and work and location in the world allows it, restrict technology as much as possible and try to go weeks without  using it, and if that can't be done, then learn to coexist with it and undo the association in your mind with addiction. I feel for a lot of hikis and NEETs most of their waking hours are spent using technology in some way, most of the time in a thoughtless, undercontrolled manner. So trying to build a healthy relationship with it is crucial if you want to escape chronic unemployment, since unlike alchohol or gambling it is not something you can entirely abstain from for the rest of your life.

Personally, I find building a more moderate relationship with tech can be done more easily if you try to be mindful and aware of your emotions and surroundings in your daily life. I find if I am very aware of my urges to use the internet throughout the day I am less likely to cave in and go on a double digit screen time binge. And all of that has to be built progressively, which brings me to my third point.

**3. Progressive overload**

Okay, I did not come up with that one, books like Atomic Habits and religions such as Buddhism have had some sort idea of a progressive incremental path to improvement before, but I have seen it in myself that progress for me at least looks like a kind of uphill spiral, an gradual uphill spiral built on small incremental changes, and it can start with something as small as making your bed first thing in the morning. I find if I begin the day with good habits, the rest of the day gets progressively better most of the time.

That is about it, that was my story of how I got out of chronic unemployment as a 19 year old living in Greece. I think people imagine hikikomori and NEETdom as solely japanese or American problems but I am realizing there are young adults and older teens who experience a delayed transition into a adulthood all over the world, and I think that is a symptom rather than the problem itself. I believe it's a symptom of many different causes and conditions, some having to do with overinvolved parenting, some more related to mental health, the state of the economy in many countries, and some related to advancements in digital technology and the internet. 

Ultimately I think if you're truly desperate to get out of this limbo, then you will, and if you put your mind to it and learn to limit distractions or learn to coexist with them, then again, you will. But like all good things, it takes time, and in my experience it takes 6 months to a year at least to turn your life around, and a couple years or more to reach major life milestones that are important for fully transitioning into adulthood, eg, getting into college or trade school, finding full time employment, moving out of your parents home, etc, so have patience and be kind to yourselves. 

If you feel behind in life, or like your youth was wasted on mental/chronic illness, remember that people have built a better life from all sorts of situations, mental illness, health issues, homelessness, prison, involvement in crime, displacement, - you name it. Sometimes better lives than if they had never experienced those things. I can not promise you that your current misery and struggle is going to make you stronger or a better person, or that you will rise from the proverbial mud like a beautiful lotus and find your life's calling through your struggle and build an awesome rich life, but I am saying, it is a possibility, and it really does happen to some people. Personally I find that my life trajectory would be less positive and not more if I hadn't had some adverse experiences and been in a rut for a very long time. But it is also valid to not feel that way and to grieve for what could have been, ultimately I think you should just allow yourself to feel whatever feelings you're currently feeling, and try not to avoid them, and maybe try to find a silver living or helpful way to think about your history, if there is one.

That was all I had to say, I am nodding off, enough yap, back to Vivaldi. ",6,1734959460.0,hikikomori,0,1.0,False

The screen shows a man in his 50s, his hair gray and he’s wearing a black business suit and a red tie. He’s standing in front of a dark blue podium with the emblem of the White House in the middle of it, he stands fiercely or so he tries in between of the flag of the US and the US president. The wall behind him is painted with the color blue and gray.

“My fellow citizens of America, today marks day 372 of what most would call Second American Civil War. Ever since that day when our once indivisible and great nation fell apart, suffering is everywhere- hunger, thirst, pain, our nation suffers greatly in those early days but now, each day is victory, and one thing for sure is that victory is upon us, some, some are already calling it the greatest victory in the history of mankind and all of it is possible thanks to our brave men and women who are still fighting to this very day from day one to bring back unity and reunite our country. 

Ongoing battles from the skylines of Los Angeles to the everglades of Florida and victory such as the Battle of New York and the Siege of Chicago, our people are fighting for our lives, our country, our unity and also to bring it back together, we owe all of these brave fighting men and women severely and to all of you fighting men and women watching this let me tell you, we owe you our lives, thank you and may god bless all of you brave souls. And to all you Americans who are watching this let me tell you that victory is near and we will unite back stronger than ever and to all of you Americans who are in those rebellious states, we will welcome you back once your secessionist government is disposed off. 

Thank you, my fellow Americans, for your service, fighting or not, may god bless all of us and may god bless and save America. One nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.”

  
Emilia shuts the tv, she prepares her camera for her work and sips a mug of coffee, the bitter yet smooth taste of it flowing through her mouth. “Bullshit as always huh”, she mumbles to her self as she then wears her bulletproof vest, black in color and the word “PRESS” stuck to the middle of the vest, sticking out like a nice sore thumb. She puts her camera in her bag and stands up and look to the window, the skylines of Detroit matched with the sunny sky and with the occasional flocks of bird flying it would be like a normal day in the metropolis- if it weren’t for the 60m gray steel wall in the distance with overlook towers every 10 cm with heavily armed Canadian guards and dozens of modified boats with guns patrolling the river driven by the US border patrol as well as the occasionally Apache Attack Helicopter passing by the sky, which is somehow more common than the birds and the almost empty streets except for a few humvees and soldiers that patrols it. She walk to the window and pull the the blinds on the window, shutting the lights that was casting over her blonde pony tailed hair and her white vanilla shirt and her 2 bed hotel room in an instant. She puts her bag on her shoulders and turns off the light and opens the door and walk through the door before closing the door and walks through the hall. “Time to go to work”, she says as she leaves.

“LET US IN, LET US IN.” The crowd screams, thousands of people are gathering at the shore, in lines of thousands of makeshift tents created from scratch under the Ambassador Bridge, they are refugees, they have came from as near as Grand Rapids and as far as Miami, all with the same goal: to escape. Emilia photographs the scene, taking one picture after another. 

“So all of these people, they came here in hopes of entering Canada and taking refuge there, but the Canadians closed their border since day one except for the few times they open the borders like on day 16 but only on several crossings which led to a stampede. Obviously, you knew about this right? Why am i even telling you this?” The policeman tells Emilia. The middle-aged man. obviously used to sights like these, instead has his hazel eyes fixated on the bridge, on one of the dark green towers on the bridge, hangs a large banner with a big bright red X in the middle of it and a message at the bottom saying “YOU ARE CROSSING A NO ENTRY ZONE, IF YOU GO PAST THIS MESSAGE, YOU WILL BE SHOT, REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY AND PURPOSE”. “It’s okay, I appreciate it, oh and yeah, so i do have a few questions regarding this camps, although i have been to like a hundred camps but each one does feel a bit unique so… is it okay i i ask a few?” Emilia asked, she smiles as the policeman looks up and think for a few seconds before replying with, “Sure, i mean you are a journalist.”, “Okay so firstly, can you tell me one of the more unique and interesting people here? Like one or 2?” Emilia asked, the policeman then immediately points out to an old man dressed in a filthy red denim jacket sitting in front of a orange tent, his belongings lining along the tent, “So that guy over there, i heard that he used to be a cop like me before the war, heard he was from New York. Now this is the part where it gets interesting, he was stationed in Coney Island.”, Emilia looks at him in the eye and says, “Coney Island? Does that mean-“, “Yep, day 5, Battle of New York, Coney Island Massacre, that means he’s one of the 400 who survived out of the 60.000 people that day.” He whispers to Emilia, Emilia then immediately starts taking picture of the man over and over again, the policeman laughing silently as he watches Emilia. 

“Okay, onto the second-“ Her question interrupted by a loud bang and screams, the sound came from the shore and she hurriedly runs to the scene and as she paves her way through the crowd,

she saw a woman, floating in the distance in the river, her lifeless body drifting with the course of the river as her blood painted the water red. She took a picture of it but unlike the others, she only took it once. “Some people are so desperate they that will take any risk.” The policeman tells her before yelling, “Okay move it people! Go back to where you came from! Move along!” The crowd disperses along with Emilia who prepares to leave the camp before looking back and seeing a boat picking up the body, the lifeless face of the woman terrifies her and Emilia decides to hurry and go back to the hotel as the sun sets and the lights slowly fading into darkness.

Emilia enters the hotel lobby, the lobby is filled with journalist and reporters, discussing about their work or just hanging out. She walks to the bar and orders a couple of drinks and sits with her group: Ben and Mia, a couple of journalists and reporters from the UK, their gray and red shirts clothing as well as ben’s long silky brown hair, Mia’s red secretary glasses and her bun makes them looks like a nice duo, if you ignore their never ending arguing. Jake, a journalist from the Reuters with a thin beard and mustache with a wavy top hair and a gold chain around his neck as well as Old Moor, an old fat man who is Emilia and Jake mentor, his stomach almost  jutted out by his blue and white stripes shirt and his gray beard glistening by the lights. She sits down with them before pulling out her laptop and camera while Old Moor is looking at the updated version of the United States, “You good Emilia?” Jake asked, “Yeah I’m good, I’m just tired“ Emilia replies, “not me though. thank god my editor’s not an asshole like any of you, I was sleeping in my room all day like I’m in Hawaii!, before all this crap happened.” Jake says, “Oh shut up you bollocks” Ben yells, “Oi, what ya problem with me mate? You up for some banter?” Jake loudly says in a mocking British accent, “Okay that’s enough the lot of you two, I am not becoming the third party again like what went down in Boston, shit’s almost got us killed.” Mia intervenes her red secretary glasses almost fell as she bangs the table in anger.

“That’s enough, now, we need to discuss our plans on where to go next.” Old Moor stated. “Okay, so Ben and I are considering going for Charleston to see the Southern-Texas alliance fleet there, thought it would be interesting since rumors is that they will be used when they breach Virginia and no other people I know is reporting these and my friend has a connection with the SA’s military so we should be able to go inside their base and get a good look at it.” Mia suggested. “Well that’s interesting of course but California seems like a more intriguing place, the US are escalating their invasion over there, but-” Jake replied and is immediately cut off by Old Moor who told him “Are you insane? You can’t get near as 10 miles from the border without being shot at, it’s even worse inside, Bakersfield? Waste dump, Sacramento? Suicide, SF? Death, LA? Also death! San Diego? Fucking same!”.

 “California is definitely a suicide mission but what about Washington’s Union? Weren’t Seattle still under siege?” Emilia asked, “Yeah and they are still under siege and the siege would probably end by like day 200 if that Washingtonian prick had the balls to put up a fight, 15 US navy destroyers against the Washingtonian air force, navy, countless of mortars and artillery surrounding them and don’t forget the might and glorious that is the great wall of Seattle, all ready to rained upon them but that prick just wanted to extend the siege to “avoid bloodbath”, though i guess they don’t want to be attacked or invaded like California and my friend, who is a political analyst, said that if they were to sink the fleet, it would cause another invasion but not as spread out as California. So yeah, it would be one hell of a shot if we get there when they had the balls but it may not be our best bet.” Jake explains.

 “Okay mister IR PhD, thank you for the detailed summary. Anyway, so, if we want to get to as near as California, i recommend that we go as far as Utah, pretty calm over there aside from all the refugees from California and New Mexico but other than that, it’s livable compared to everywhere else. Besides, Nevada is a no go since operation Dessert Columbus is still going on so its pretty much California or Afghanistan and in Arizona they have their own version of this war, so Utah is our safest bet if we want to go out far west.” Emilia suggested. “That actually seems like a pretty good plan, we could scope out the west and make up the rest of our plans while on the journey and we could stop by and see some sights, I have always wanted to see the 4 craters.” Old Moor said. “Okay then seems fine for us, what do you say Jake?” Mia asked to him, who is scratching his chin who then replied with a nod. “That settles it, Utah or whatever the fuck we are going it is, we go at 9, prepare your stuff.” Old Moor told them, they all replied with a nod. “To our footages” Mia said raising her glass, “To football” Ben said while also raising his glass, Mia sighed and raised her glass of wine as well. “to money” Jake yelled, “And may our survival be long” Emilia said, raising her glass along with Old Moor and then they toast and talks for sometimes before they all go to their rooms to rest.

Emilia swipes her keycard to the door, she opens it and walks inside her room, she turns on the lights and throw her bag into the bed. She then went to the bathroom, the whole room was quiet except for an occasional sound from the outside or her phone’s notifications as she took a well earned and needed shower before changing her clothes into a her sleeping attire. She lays on the bed, arms and legs sprawled wide, she then feels her eyes becoming more heavy, her vision darkened more and more before she closes her eyes, and off to sleep she goes.

  
New York City, New York, United States, 2022, May 19th 2022, 4:32 PM EST

  
“Is this good for me? How about this?” Emilia asked her self in front of a mirror, she is deciding on wether to used a red or a white purse, her face is a mixed of confusion and panic, her brown dress contrasting with her almost pink colored room. “Emilia! Didn’t you say you need to be there at 4? That’s 28 minutes from now!”, “Ugh! Coming Mom!” Emilia yelled as she decided to use her white purse, she almost tripped by her dress as she ran down the stairs. Emilia’s Mom is in the living room, the space is a simple but cozy place with light green wallpapers and wooden brown flooring with flowers placed nicely on certain spots, her mom is watching the news on the TV and Emilia then approaches her.

 “Both bomb went off at 2:32 PM, the car was parked right next to the governor’s convoy, and just right when governor Arthur McLarry walked by the car as you can see here, it..it went off. The first explosion killed more than 200 people including governor Arthur McLarry, Mayor of Boston Mary J Lorrison and Boston Metropolitan Police Chief Park James. The first bomb also damages the Center Plaza and the Government Center Station. The second bomb went off five seconds after the first one and was located inside the city hall, the mayor’s office told be exact, the second one killed 34 people and injured approximately 100 people. The damaged done by the second..”. 

“Mom, you really need to stop watching these news, it’s gonna give you paranoia.” Emilia said, her mom giving her a smug look in response, “Oh shut up, I lived through 9/11, The Great Dissolves, the 2014 Depression, the time when there’s that attempted coup and all that massacres and terror that happened elsewhere, trust me, I know what “paranoia” feels like, don’t even get me started about the whole “We are in for a second civil war!” Bullshit.” Her mom responded, Emilia rolls her eyes as she tidies her dress and puts her pink purse on her right shoulder and her heels. “Well, I better get going! Janae’s waiting for me! Bye mom!” Emilia said to her mom as she opens the door and immediately leave the house, her mom just sigh as she heard her daughter’s car engine go off and drives in an instant, “Well I’il be damned.”

1hkne8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/springfieldMO/comments/1hkne8i/springfield_restaurant/,Springfield Restaurant ,"I am looking for a restaurant that I ate at a couple of years ago in Springfield, Missouri.
Here’s when I remember about it .
It was in a neighborhood, like a historical older neighborhood. 

It had outdoor seating and it was packed. We actually went next-door to a coffee shop to get a drink while we waited for our table.

There were water jars outside, where we could refill our own waters.

They must have had gluten-free options, although we can’t remember what kind of food we ate there.

Is there anyone out there who knows the name of this place and the name of the coffee shop next-door?
It was not on the main downtown street.  
Your help is appreciated

Before I charm you with my wit (from the large amount of editing that I can do behind the screen) - physically I'm 5'8"", Chinese, average weight ~165lbs.

Also, it looks like we might have a white Christmas this year and I'm excited! Though I've already celebrated an early Christmas with the fam and got some great gifts (lot of cooking stuff).

Looking out for that best friend with - someone to cook with, laze around with, or try new things! like shopping for clothes or random gadgets, axe throwing, puzzle rooms, museums, all that jazz. Though, I'm definitely a introvert, who needs some time to let the social battery recharge. Help drag me out to new places! I need someone to go watch Hadestown on Broadway with!

Besides that, I've definitely fallen off the bandwagon on my most recent health kick, but have been getting back into it - goal is lose weight, gain muscles! Maybe lose the dad bod eventually (though I know some people love it) .. but if you do have some healthy meal prep you like to make ( high protein low calorie) hit me up! I've been a big fan of chili so far.

Hobbies wise, there's a 95% chance that I'm probably watching TV, reading, playing video games, or cooking 🤓.

5% chance that someone's dragged me out of my cave to go rock climbing or outside to touch grass. 

I definitely gravitate more to the gamer side, but I call myself a super nerd. Cause I play, read / watch:

- video games (TFT, WoW, and soo much more)
- anime, manga / manhua
- Korean dramas, reality TV, anything about cooking, survival shows
- books (Wind and Truth anyone?)
- DnD
- and that's just the tip of the iceberg (maybe)

You might be able to tell I'm a little bit of a homebody. Discord and media has definitely made it so comfy to stay at home... but, with enough convincing, I've been known to venture out into the unknown.

**Memory transcript subject: Kiki, Venlil powerplant technician and Venlil-Human Exchange Participant.**

Date: \[Standardised human time\] August 25th, 2136

“Thank you for inviting us!” The two doctors waved to us as they reached the corner of the hall we were waiting in, giving their species’ respective signs of happiness. 

Me and Velan waved back, while Maky simply smiled back at them with a curt nod, before reaching her hand out to shake their hand and paw respectively. “Of course! It was the least we could do after all you’ve done for us. Please, come take a seat.”

She led our small group to the circular tables standing in front of the Human café with a sharp clicking of her metal heels against the hard floor. The first time she extended those almost gave me a migraine. Having a set of formal artificial pelts sounded like a fine idea for a species that wore them, and footwear designed to make the wearer appear taller didn’t sound like that much of a stretch. Being more intimidating was arguably a decent way to create a presence.

But who in their right mind would attach spehing *telescopic heels* to their *shins?*

She explained it was because she wanted to have high heels for certain situations, but also needed to ‘not have them on for running’. So instead of using two separate pairs of shoes like a normal person, she made an overcomplicated gadget to simulate *both*.

Honestly, I had to respect that.

We all sat down around a table near a large planter sprouting a variety of Venlil Prime’s flora. Similar planters were all around the small café, growing both long and short-leafed plants and flowers of all colours. I even saw a few bushes trimmed into geometric shapes. I knew the UN and the Venlil government spared little expense to make this program a success, but I didn’t realise they’d go so far as to hire professional gardeners! Their services were so expensive!

I took out my pad to scan the leaflet with a visCode printed alongside a strange square with black and white pixels, which I assumed was the Human equivalent. The screen shifted to a browser window displaying a surprisingly well-designed menu, presenting all the different drinks and desserts available for purchase in Venlil script.

Not that I could really understand any of the words, apart from ‘tea’ and ‘juice’ and the occasional adjective. Although I had no idea what an *‘Almond’* was, or why it and *‘Oat’* were the only juices from the whole selection you could add to this *‘Coffee’* thing.

Maky quickly cast a lense at the doctors and one at Velan and me. She then leaned a little back with crossed legs, placing both her palms on her knee. “I will be taking the bill today, so please order anything you wish. A fair warning to the Venlil present, everything in the *coffee* section has *very* high caffeine content. I’d strongly discourage you from ordering any more than one.”

We all gave our ear flicks and nods of understanding as we started placing our orders. I decided to get ‘Raspberry pie’, which was surprisingly cheap for what looked like premium pastries, and a *‘Latte’.* I quickly checked the caffeine content written below the nutritional information, balking at the absurdly high \[87 mg\]. *I’m definitely not getting any Sprunk later…*

I looked at the others sitting around the table, each also finishing up their orders. I flicked my ears over to Maky, who herself was tapping something onto air. I quickly inspected her posture and movements – she acted restrained and proper, a far cry from her usual impulsive self. It felt… *strange.* “Alright, I’m done here. Would you like me to help you carry the food?” I asked her, giving her a little poke.

She looked at me with a soft smile and a nod. “Sure! Let me just…” she quickly swiped her hand up and tapped something. “Ah, there. Got my order in too. Let’s go.” She leaned a little forward before standing up in a single fluid and elegant motion.

I got up from my chair as well, giving the doctors and Velan a little wave with my tail as me and Maky made our way to the café bar. The baristas were already hard at work preparing our drinks, machines loudly *rurring* with activity. I looked up at Maky, my ears pointing towards her for a few solid seconds before her lense finally landed on me. “So, how come you act so formal suddenly? I don’t think I’ve seen you like this before.”

She tilted her head a little as she thought about my words for a few moments. She then raised her shoulders up a bit before letting them fall back down as she focused on me again. “I mean, I don’t know the two doctors as much as I do you and Velan. I tend to play it safe with new people and try to keep it more formal.”

My ear gave a confused swivel. “Well, you hadn’t known Velan before meeting her either. How was that so different?”

“Hmm… I’m not entirely sure.” She said with a sigh, leaning onto one of the couple pillars that were helping hold the large room’s structural integrity. “I’d guess it was because she was in a rough situation then. Being overly formal wouldn’t have helped I don’t think. That, and the fact she looks so cute.”

I prompted her to elaborate with a confused head tilt, which she seemed to have understood perfectly. “So, that’s a funny little quirk of our brains. Things with big heads, big eyes, and a small nose remind us of babies, which triggers parental instincts. You people trigger that *all the fucking time.* It’s surreal.”

“Huh. So… is this the reason you people find predators cute?” I asked her with a tail flick towards the bar, where the baristas were just finishing our orders, while trying not to think about how the tall predator casually just dropped that she finds us ‘cute’.

Maky followed where I pointed before nodding and pushing herself off the wall. “Yeah, that’s it. I think. I’m a software girl, not a psychologist.” She said as we started on our way, not noticing my confusion as the last word translated.

I shook my head, instead focusing on the baristas’ work. The various pastries we ordered were already neatly arranged on a tray, right next to some of the beverages. A machine suddenly stopped making noise, prompting a Human with long hair to retrieve a tall glass and a carton with what appeared like oblong nuts depicted on the side from a cooler. I gave them a friendly little wave when they paused, catching a sight of me, to which they nodded and proceeded to pour an off-white liquid into a strange metal pot.

I tilted my head a little, looking at it with interest. I drank my fair share of plant juice, especially in my childhood. But I couldn’t remember any that looked like this. It did however bear a striking resemblance to something else I unfortunately knew the Humans quite enjoyed – especially in their *coffee…* “Hey Maky?” I asked as I watched the barista put the pot into a machine, a slightly disturbing idea starting to form in my head.

One of her lenses looked down at me questioningly. “Yeah?” She asked, pausing her usual absent-minded scrolling and pivoting a lense at me.

“What’s the white stuff? I’d never seen anything quite like it.” I pointed my tail at a glass with a bit of brown liquid – probably that *coffee* thing if I had to guess – as the long-haired barista poured a very similar white fluid into it.

Maky flicked an eye to the carton, perking up with what I assumed was recognition. “Oh, that’s almond mi-“ She cut herself off mid-word, as she and the baristas froze. She snapped her lenses forward, her gaze darting over the menu displayed on the back wall in search of something. “Uhh- almond *juice.* Y-yeah, that’s what it is – nut juice.” She stammered out, trying to salvage the situation.

I laughed, my tail wagging at full speed behind me. “Hihi, oh that almost confirmed it.” I sighed, flicking an ear up at her, before lowering my voice so no nearby Venlil could overhear. “This looks incredibly similar to milk, and I *know* you people put that stuff into *coffee.* So, tell me Mak, *is this plant milk?”*

She looked down at me with a nervous chuckle, scratching the back of her neck. “Y-yeah, it is.”

I flicked both of my ears in disbelief as I approached the counter. “You just couldn’t stay satisfied with animals, could you? You just *had* to turn plants into milk as well.” I could see the two baristas looking at me with apprehension, obviously hesitant on how to approach a conversation like this.

I offered them a calming tail flick, even if they most likely couldn’t understand it. “Don’t worry about me – I won’t go telling anyone. Besides, it’s not like you’re serving anyone actual animal milk. I don’t see a way you’d even get it on the station if the UN is as thorough as Maky told me.” I said, when another idea popped in my head. “Oh, and by the way – why do you people even have plant milk? It doesn’t seem necessary if you really do retain tolerance into adulthood…”

They both breathed a quick sigh of relief, quickly finishing up our drinks. The barista with long hair placed the finished drink, which looked *exactly* like the *Latte* I ordered, on the tray before explaining with a voice my translator read as feminine. “Well, while very common, not every Human is lactose tolerant. And some people are still used to the taste from when there were ethical issues with animal milk, although we’d thankfully solved those by now.”

I nodded my head with an ear flick. “That’s good to hear at least, I honestly expected worse than that. I just wonder, how does it taste?”

She leaned on the counter a little, thinking through her answer. I couldn’t help but take a quick glance at her chest, which again sported enlarged breasts. I was becoming increasingly certain that they were simply sexual dimorphism, as selecting only mothers for the female exchange participants would make little sense. But in that case, why would Maky not have them?

The barista’s voice brought me back to reality, as she spun her hand uncertainly. “Well, it has a slight nutty flavour, and a nice creamy texture. It goes really well with a variety of sweets, and it can also be used to bake pastries.”

“I see.” I replied with a nod as the other barista put a drink not unlike my *‘latte’* – except with cubes of ice floating on top – down on the other tray.

“That should be everything. Would you like to pay using code or contact?” He asked with a deeper voice that was interpreted as masculine. I took a good look at his form, spotting some differences in bone structure compared to the Human females, as well as a distinct lack of chest pillows. These traits were shared by doctor Jordan, which also pointed to dimorphism. Maky didn’t have any of these, which threw my previous working breastlessness hypothesis that she transitioned out the window.

“Contact, please.” She said, stretching her hand out towards a terminal. Her lips curved up a little at the *beep* that came from it. She handed me a tray before picking one up herself, nodding towards the baristas. “Thank you, both for the *coffee* and for answering my friend’s questions.”

The female barista waved her hand in the same way Maky did to signal dismissal. “No problem at all. I am honestly surprised just how well you took it, the other Venlil I’d met so far would probably not handle it well at all.” She said, glancing in my direction.

My tail gave an amused flick. “Well to be fair, I did freak out the first time Maky mentioned it. But I don’t know, I guess I just processed that piece of nightmare fuel already.” I looked at the *‘latte’* on my tray with a chuckle, before leaning in a little to get a taste of the steam. It tasted sweet and creamy, with an earthy undertone. “It is just nut juice – I don’t see anything wrong with drinking it. Who knows, maybe I’ll like it! It tastes nice.”

The female barista nodded and gave me a smile. It was… *different* from Maky’s, far wider and showing more of her white teeth. I guessed she either forgot Venlil weren’t the fondest of teeth-baring, or correctly guessed I wouldn’t freak out. It was still kind of creepy though. “Anyways, it was a pleasure! Stop by again sometimes!” She said happily, as me and Maky gave her a tail and hand wave respectively.

I looked up to Maky as we slowly walked back to our table, lowering my voice a bit. “Any particular reason she smiled so wide?”

She tilted her head in thought, keeping a lense on me as the other looked back at the still smiling Human. “They’re probably American…” She giggled at my confused look before explaining in a way that made slightly more sense. “Cultural difference – where I’m from, we aren’t usually as aggressively smiley to strangers.”

The tip of my tail whipped up in mischief. “Sounds about right, you can be a bit of an ass sometimes…”

She softly poked my leg with her shoe as she laughed at my remark. “You little-! How do you even keep coming up with these?”

I flicked both my ears, giving her a light slap back with my tail tuft. “No way am I telling you – you won’t get my secrets that easily, predator!”

She started laughing as we neared our table before her eyes fell on the doctors. She cleared her throat and straightened her back, as her spring-loaded heels clicked back out to their full length. I hadn’t even noticed her retract them!

We placed the trays down silently, careful not to interrupt the ongoing conversation. Doctor Ryalis was excitedly explaining something regarding the empathy tests to Velan. Doctor Jordan looked on from his seat, though I couldn’t determine what he was thinking.

“...And confirmed without a shadow of a doubt that Humans have empathy on a biochemical level! This is completely revolutionary; an actual, empathetic predator species!” Her tail wagged behind her as she talked, an unstoppable wave of genuine excitement breaking through her usually professional demeanour. Not that I could blame her, I was just as excited when I finally grasped Maky’s empathy for the first time.

Doctor Jordan sighed as he leaned forward, elbows resting on the table. He reached his hand out and picked up a small cup filled with presumably *coffee* from one of the trays and placed it before himself, stirring the liquid with a small metallic tool – a spoon, if I remembered right. “Well, while I am happy that your people have the information they need to trust us now, I can’t help but wonder if the method may have been a bit too…” He paused to take a sip of his drink, when his face twitched in an odd way, and he reached for the sugar bowl. *“…a bit too much.”*

“What do you mean?” Ryalis asked with an inquisitive ear swivel. “The empathy testing was a complete success! We had positive confirmation from each researcher, even those on station three had-”

Doctor Jordan resolutely cut her off with a raised palm, shaking his head. “First, we don’t talk about station three.” *Huh? What happened there?* “And second, we also had a lot of people complaining about the graphic nature of the test. I mean, I went back myself and watched the video that caused Maky to dissociate and- *Christ,* forcing somebody to watch *that* on Earth would land you in jail for torture…” He looked blankly forward for a moment, before shaking his head and taking another sip of his *coffee.* This time, his lips almost unnoticeably curved up.

The Venlil doctor turned to her Human counterpart with a look of shock. “Wait what? Torture? This is standard practice!” She exclaimed, her tail spinning in agitation. My honest feelings were the same; this *was* the standard practice to determine whether somebody was empathetic or not! Even Velan flicked her ear in agreement!

But the Humans apparently believed otherwise, as the good doctor’s eyes widened to a point I never thought possible. Well, I didn’t have much to go off of when it came to the Humans’ eyes, except that they traditionally faced forward. That was absolutely the fault of the lanky, black-clad woman staring at the Venlil doctor sideways with a camera lens. She didn’t seem to want to speak up, unlike the currently quite displeased doctor opposite her. “Standard practice?! Do you mean to tell me that you people have done this before? To who, the Arxur?”

I quickly stepped in to change the topic before doctor Ryalis had the chance to say anything, because given what I just learned about Humans, neither of them would be happy that the answer was *‘our own people’.* “Hey uhh, what did you get there, Velan? It looks delicious!”

The unnecessarily loud question seemed to do the trick, as it successfully derailed the doctor’s attention, although I couldn’t help but feel sorry for Velan. The sudden shift of the spotlight caught her completely off guard, so her response of ‘something named *hot chocolate* and *strawberry cake’* came out very stammered. I wasn’t putting much attention on her though, instead trying to gauge what Maky managed to catch. The way she tilted her head as she turned a lens to me gave me the feeling she knew something was up but wasn’t going to ask. Not for now, at least.

*Thank the Stars.*

The conversation shifted to the food and drinks in front of us. I took a long sip of my *latte* while Maky explained what the difference between a cake and a pie was, enjoying the rich sweetness of the strange hot drink and feeling the energy surge through me from the actually insane amounts of caffeine. *Hmmm, I wonder what it would taste like with actual mil-*

I blinked for a moment, slightly shell shocked by the thought. *Why the speh would I want to know that?* The very thought of consuming animal milk was revolting, but a sense of morbid curiosity was persistent. *What in the scorched wastes was so special about milk and meat for them to want to keep eating it, even if they didn’t need to?*

I glanced at Maky, who calmly observed the others chatting, sipping her iced *latte* with a straw as a little smile played on her thick lips. *Well, I can’t say I don’t get the milk part if it’s as good as the almond one…* I thought, my tail unconsciously starting to sway in happiness as I took another little sip. *Stars, this is really good…*

“…So Velan, how are you holding up? Losing your partner couldn’t have been easy, even if your coordinator let you stick with Kiki and Marketa.” I flicked a concurring ear to Jordan as he asked his question, before pointing my ears over to Velan. In the few paws following the Arxur raid, me, Maky, and the doctors had to actively fight with station management to let Velan stay with us. Thankfully, our coordinator was happy to let her remain a part of our tiny herd – thus just barely letting her dodge the waves of Venlil expelled for one reason or another – be it loss of partner, quitting in fright, or being removed for *attacking a Human.*

Velan straightened out and opened her mouth to answer, but again closed it and slumped a little forward. She brought her tail into her lap, gently kneading its spotter grey fur. “It’s…” She sighed, slightly flicking one of her drooping ears. “It isn’t easy. I… I miss Christopher so much. However *twisted* his motive for joining the program may have been, he pulled me out of a very bad place. He was- *he was all I had…”*

She finished her answer with a sharp inhale through her teeth, indicating that tears were about to start pouring out of her eyes. I reached my tail out under the table to gently and maybe a little awkwardly brush against her side in a calming gesture, eliciting a single half-hearted wag from her tail. “I em… I’m so sorry you had to go through that. Believe it or not, I was in a very similar basket before getting to know Maky; and Stars, I have no idea what I would do if she got suddenly ripped away. But you are not alone, Velan.” My tail wrapped around her arm, making her look into my eye as her right ear swivelled in confusion. “You have us. Me and Maky. We may only be a herd of three, but we look out for each other.”

Velan gingerly flicked an ear in affirmation, letting go of her tail and allowing it to slowly wag. I still saw a tear leave her eye, but I had a feeling it wasn’t one of sorrow. “Th-thank you. That… that means a lot.” She pointed her ears at me, then at Maky. She tried to imitate the tall Human’s nod, though the motion was a bit rigid. *Huh, was my first nod this bad too?*

Maky’s lips curved up gently as she nodded back. The little smile widened as she chuckled at what I assumed was a random thought she just got. *Stars what is it this time-* “I still think we should use the term *pack.* Those are usually smaller and tighter kni-*ffft!* Hey! What was that for?!” She half-shouted, breaking into a barely controlled laugh. I contemplated smacking her in the face with my tail tuff once more, but I chose to spare her that.

Instead, I also broke into a laugh. “Come on, Mak! We were supposed to be having a moment! I know you’re a predator and all that, but you don’t have to drag me and Velan into it too!”

Maky opened her mouth in a mock expression of shock, placing a hand on her chest as if my words wounded her. That got a few whistles out of Velan as well, whose tail started flicking from side to side. “Yeah! We’re *quite* happy not being walking murder machines, *thank you very much!”*

The giggling predator was about to shoot back a retort of her own when a pair of chuckling voices interrupted further banter, one far deeper than the other. “I can see that you three bonded quite well, despite all the hurdles.” Doctor Ryalis’ tail flicked side to side as she observed our antics. She took a sip of her drink – it was somewhat reminiscent of my *latte,* except there was a thick layer of foam on top sprinkled with a brown dust of some sort. I could only guess what the foam was, and hope that the doctor didn’t realise she was slurping up the absolute affront to nature that was bubbled up nut milk. “I’m glad the admins saw reason in letting you both stay in the end.”

Velan and Maky each gave their signal of appreciation, an ear flick and smiling nod respectively. The black-clad Human put down her cup and turned her eyes to both doctors. “Again, thank you so much for helping us. It can’t have been easy making them not kick me out, given the whole *technically failing an empathy test* thing. God, what favours did you even have to pull to make that happen?”

Doctor Jordan chuckled at that, before pulling out his pad and opening something on it. It looked just like the other Human pads – or phones, as they called them – that I’d seen. A little small even for us, let alone the far larger predators. *They still seem quite adept at using them somehow though.* *A question for another paw.* “Well, we thankfully didn’t have to resort to that. All it really took was writing a *slightly* cherry-picked report and attaching research that proves the reaction was caused by overwhelming negative emotion. As far as admins and other researchers are aware, you despised everything you saw to the point your brain got completely overwhelmed-“

“Just like many federation species’ would.” Interrupted doctor Ryalis, as a bit of smugness flicked through her tail. “All it took was finding the right way to frame it.”

I tilted my head, my confusion showing through a swivel of my ear. “That’s… why would you *lie* for a complete stranger like that? Wouldn’t that get you in some serious trouble with the…?” Velan flicked an ear along, clearly agitated. Her tail was spinning like mad.

“Well… it does sound worse if you put it like that.” Ryalis sighed, before circling her ear around and grabbing her *coffee* cup. “Both of us volunteered because we wanted our species to be friends. That means this program *has* to work out.” She brought the cup to her lips, taking a long drink. Her tail started wagging halfway through and continued even as she contently sighed and put the cup back down. “We read the research and went through your files. Neither me nor Jordan believe you are dangerous. However…”

She flicked her tail towards Jordan, who returned the gesture with a nod. “However, we do have a couple questions, if you don’t mind.” Even though the translator framed the intonation as a statement, there was a question very obviously implied there.

One that Maky answered with a “Certainly, please go ahead!” as she nodded and swung herself back up straight, her face momentarily scrunching up strangely as she put the formal façade she accidentally dropped during the last conversation back on. *Huh, did she just- forget she meant to do that?*

Ryalis made a single flick of her ear before clearing her throat with a high-pitched whistle. While not pleasant, the sound was at least less offensive than the big human’s explosive growl. *At least Velan stopped jumping every time Mak did that. While funny the first couple times, watching her get spooked whenever Maky coughed got actually pretty sad.*

“Alright then. First off, if you don’t mind… what in the *damned Night* is that thing in your head? I’ve been trying to figure out what it’s actually supposed to do for the past three paws, because there’s *no way* it’s just a brain scanner. It’s too big and complex.” The Venlil finished with a small huff, putting down her *coffee* as she leaned forward. Both of her ears we squarely pointed at Maky, the agitated twitching of her tail betraying just how much she wanted that answer.

That was something I certainly related with, flicking my own ears while turning them towards her in hopes I’d get to learn more about the contraption my friend decided to stuff inside her head.

Maky shrugged, lifting her fingers up and started going through that interface of hers. “Well… I can explain the whole implant if you all want, but the thing is pretty complicated so it’d take a while. It’ll also be full of technobabble that I *think* might be a bit too out there for anyone other than Kiki here-“

A high-pitched groan suddenly emanated from the other side of the Human. A quick flick of my ear over helped me catch a silent whisper of *“please don’t,”* just barely loud enough for Maky to catch it from Velan’s mouth as she buried her face in her arms.

The woman snorted out a chuckle, bringing her cold *latte* up to her lips and taking a long sip. “Okay, don’t worry.” She chuckled again, putting the coffee down before grabbing something and swiping it out towards us. The slight tilt of my head it caused turned into a double take as my pad suddenly pinged; and not just mine, both doctors’ devices made a sound of their own as well. I gave the woman a side-eye as I pulled my pad out of its satchel, seeing a few charts and text files added to my download folder. *What the speh? I mean, I did give her access to put files directly in there if she needed, but I’m pretty sure the doctors didn’t??*

I looked at them, only to see them exchange a slightly bewildered glance before Ryalis flicked a ‘*I’m not dealing with this’* at the same time Jordan shrugged, before they both tapped something open. I also tapped an image, showing a diagram of the implant with descriptions for each part written in a blocky alien script; at least until my pad translated the whole thing into something far more legible. *Stars, this is almost as complex as the control units in the powerplant’s critical systems, except on a significantly smaller scale… I’m gonna have so much fun dissecting this when Maky sleeps!*

A slow happy sway entered my tail as I flicked an ear up to Maky, examining the power supply of the device as she gave her shortened explanation. “Well, the implant is a prototype of sorts, combining a couple experimental functions. Simply put – the implant scans my brain, allows me to use my sideways vision, and… uhmm… helps *regulate* the dissociations.”

Doctor Jordan looked up into her face with the skin around his nose a little scrunched up, putting his phone back into his pocket. “That sounds dangerous, rewiring your neural structure like that. Speaking of dangerous; the document calls for installing most of the implant in one piece. Did they have to like- pull your brain apart and then put it back together?” 

My tail froze at that, an eye flying up to look at Maky. But whatever the reaction I was expecting was, it wasn’t her bursting out laughing. “They did, actually! Thankfully no accidental lobotomy here, although I am a little sad they didn’t let me stay up and play a guitar during the surgery.” She tilted her head slightly with a chuckle, before continuing as if she didn’t just describe the single most brahking unhinged thing one could ever have done to themselves. “…Although that might be for the best, given my optical nerves were severed for a good chunk of it… That *would* suck.”

The silence that stretched across our group was almost deafening, as each of us took varying amounts of cognitive load to reconcile with the black-clad woman’s actions. The one to finally break the tension was to my slight surprise Velan, swivelling her ears in disbelief. “…Holy Stars above Kiki you were right – she *is* completely insane.”

I thought these words would start another bout of silence; except I noticed a new sound emerge – a short, repetitive, whistling sound. Laughter. *MY* laughter. I only realised I actually started laughing as I was already bending over, wrapping my tail around my stomach as my arms covered my mouth. My mirth was soon mirrored by a deeper one as a certain predator with zero sense of self-preservation joined me, shortly followed by Velan, Ryalis, and finally even Jordan with his deep, rumbling barks.

I was certain we must have attracted a few eyes as we laughed, but it mattered little compared to the sheer *absurdity* of the logic displayed by my friend. Nothing. *NOTHING* on the face of Venlil Prime or among the distant Stars could have ever prepared me for that. I honestly thought my brain had to do that *‘dissociation’* thing too, given that I simply accepted her words at face value and just slotted it all in with all the other insane shit Maky has done.

Jordan seemed to have come to a similar conclusion, giving a final chuckle with a shake of his head. “Well, you’re here and functioning *well enough,* so I suppose there wasn’t any harm…” The human picked his cup up again, taking another sip. “That answered our second question too, I figured you *had* to rewire your eyes somehow. Onto question three then – I had a read through your files, and only found ADHD and ASD in there. Do the dissociations you experience happen randomly, or do you have some form of a condition triggering them?”

My ears gave confused swivels as I looked over at Maky, mulling over the doctor’s words. Him casually dropping that Maky’s eyes were rewired was confusing enough; but it was the two things presumably affecting her mind that gave me pause. Especially since I have never experienced a translator struggle with something so bad. It almost worried me a bit, showing in the slightest hesitation in my claw as I poked Maky’s side. “Wh-what do those words mean? They didn’t… translate well.”

The tall woman paused her thinking to quickly look at me, before she shrugged. “Well basically, my brain behaves differently than a normal Human’s would. I get distracted easily, focus on details a bit too hard, and my thought patterns are just a mess overall.” I watched her as she leaned back a little and tilted her head as she usually did while thinking.

EVERYTHING suddenly made a lot more sense. *She actually* isn’t *normal. Not even for the insane apes.* There was a sense of relief when hearing that, but despite that I couldn't help but feel just a little uneasy. *Her explanation sounded way too close to PD even for my comfort.*

Velan seemed to have that thought as well, that much I could tell from her curling her tail around her torso. Her voice hitched in her throat as she spoke. “W-wait, isn’t that just-“

“No.” Ryalis interrupted her with a resolute flick of her ear before she could speak the name of the horrible affliction. “It’s not. Whatever it is, Jordan was very insistent that it’s quite common in Humans, and completely safe.”

Maky looked from one to the other with a strange expression. It seemed like her usual confused face, but with something else also mixed in. She did a strange hand wave, then quickly tapped something onto air before answering the original question. “…Well, I’m pretty sure I have *something.* I don’t have it properly diagnosed, but I did bring it up with a psychologist…” *There’s that word again, what the speh do you mean by ‘broader definition of assessor’?* “But they had no clue what to do with me, said I don’t fit into any known diagnosis. I do know it is related to trauma.”

“Hmm. Well I did expect something like that, but it’s still a bit troubling.” Jordan leaned back into the chair, holding his hands together and twiddling his long, furless fingers. A few \[seconds\] later he sighed and reached out to grab his *coffee,* finishing its brown contents with a last swing as his lips scrunched down. A frown, I believe Maky called it. “I don’t think there should be any issues for now… but you should really consider properly seeking help once you return back to Earth.”

Maky looked away for a moment, then nodded once. “Yeah… I really should. I just- I don’t know anyone I can bring this to. Anyone I can *trust* enough.” I watched as my friend sighed and turned sideways in her seat, retracting from the table slightly. She sipped her cold *coffee* with a straw as she instinctively brought her knee up a little and bent closer to it, as if trying to ball up for protection.

*Aw…*

I scooted my chair closer to Maky’s, producing a sharp scraping sound as I dragged it over the floor tiles. Maky lifted a lense up to look at me, tilting her head as she tried to figure out what I was doing. She didn’t have to think for long before I wrapped my arms and tail around her, bringing her into a tight hug as I gently rubbed my snout against her collarbone. Moments later I could feel a second set of furred appendages also wrap around the tall woman as Velan decided to come comfort our chaotic predator too, even if she seemed a little hesitant in her movements.

Maky froze, quite obviously unsure of what she was supposed to do with two large balls of wool stuck to her sides. I glanced up at her, and seeing a little smile play on her lips I elected to smack her in the face with an ear. That got out of her the exact reaction I wanted, as she burst out chuckling and relaxed. What I hadn’t accounted for however was a set of long gloved fingers suddenly starting to scratch the top of my head.

The fingers kept moving back and forth, filling my mind with a soft sense of security. The motion felt surprisingly nice and before I knew it, a purr began building up in my chest. *What is this? Some sort of weird Human grooming behav-*“eeeeee!\~” The sound I let out was far from flattering, but I couldn’t help it with the bliss produced by Maky’s blunt digit suddenly brushing against a soft spot just behind my left ear that was apparently not properly scratched in a *while.*

I tried to cover my blooming face with my paws, but the embarrassment was unavoidable by now. Not helped by my wagging tail at all. Or by the way my ears involuntarily moved out of the way to allow my predator’s dexterous fingers rub my worries away. I heard a whistling chuckle from the other side, before it too was interrupted by an unfortunate bleat, followed by a second purr.

And as if she hadn’t made me self-conscious enough just now, the insane Human petting me softly laughed and whispered *‘holy shit, they’re actually just like cats-’*

I looked up through my claws, bloom forgotten as I stared the woman down for a few solid \[seconds\] after the meaning was fully translated. *Okay, no. You’re NOT comparing me to a predator. ESPECIALLY not one you think is CUTE.* While the words themselves never left my mouth, I made very sure the meaning behind them was as clear as a day’s sky by proceeding to smack the eternal darkness out of her with my tail.

Her single confused “Ack-!” was immediately covered by her roaring laughter as she playfully smacked me back with her hands as I converted the embarrassment into violence directed straight at her uncovered mouth. It took about fifteen hits and the rest of our group also joining in the chuckling for her to finally raise her hands and call out “Okay! Okay *heh*-you win! I give up!”

“Hihi, that’s right! But don’t think I’ll forget this anytime soon! I *will* get back at you one day!” I chuckled myself as I turned back towards the table with a smug flicking of my tail, still resting against Maky’s side. Grabbing my *latte* I took another long swing, almost finishing the drink. *Speh, I’m not going to sleep am I?*

I turned the glass upside down to get the last bits of my drink down my gullet, choosing to deal with *that* problem once I get there. While putting the glass back down I caught a sight of the two doctors exchanging a strange glance I couldn’t fully read. Ryalis pointed her tail at me and Maky, moving it from me to her and then back as she swivelled an unsure ear with her head tilted. Jordan took a longer look at us with a single eyebrow raised, before he turned back to her and shrugged, a cheeky smirk on his lips. *Now what the speh are those two up to?*

We all collectively sat in a calm silence for a bit, when suddenly the doctors’ devices started making known the fact they had somewhere to be soon. Doctor Ryalis quickly downed the last of her coffee, momentarily pausing as her tail twitched on its own – as if triggered by the horrifying volume of stimulants she just ingested at once. *Maybe it was, actually… Speh.* “We apologise, but we unfortunately ran out of time before our next shift in the med bay.” She and the Human doctor got up, giving us a wave – and what I assumed to be the Human’s equivalent in a nod. “It was a pleasure!”

“Likewise!” Answered Maky, as both me and Velan concurred with our respective whistle and beep, waving our tails to the doctors as they took their leave.

1hkn3cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1hkn3cl/here_is_how_i_find_zero_search_volume_low/,"Here is How I find Zero Search Volume, low competition but high traffic potential","I was one of the people (the second after writer.com) who started AI content detectors back when ChatGPT was launched along with a tool called AI to human text converter. Both of these terms (and relevant others) have now millions in search volume.

These and countless other opportunities I have found over the years by using a simple yet effective keyword research strategy.

The more you research the better the outcome is.

I won't share any typical strategy like look into comp keywords blah blah

This method helps sites that are new, low authority, in a competitive niche and that want to target keywords that big sites don't have dedicated pages for.

So here is how this goes.

I start by using Google /Bing and Youtube Autocomplete to understand how people search for my topic. Let's say I'm researching ""coffee machines."" I'll type different combinations:

* ""what coffee machines""
* ""when coffee machines""
* ""how coffee machines""
* ""are coffee machines""
* ""why coffee machines""
* So on

This shows me the actual phrases people type into Google. For example, typing ""how coffee machine"" might show suggestions like ""how coffee machine works"" or ""how coffee machine works.""

Next, I look at the Keywords Everywhere extension suggestions for each search. The extension shows additional keywords on the right side of Google results. I write down all unique keywords it suggests.

Then comes the key part - I take all these keywords and check them in Semrush. But here's what makes this method different: I specifically focus on keywords that Semrush shows as having zero search volume. These are often overlooked keywords that actually have search potential.

To verify this potential, I export these zero-volume keywords and put them into Google Keyword Planner. I'm looking for keywords that show:

* 10-100 monthly searches (or more)
* Year-over-year increase in searches

For example, a keyword like ""coffee machine pressure adjustment"" might show zero volume in Semrush but have 100 monthly searches in Keyword Planner with increasing interest.

As a final check, I look up these keywords in Google Trends, focusing on my target country. This helps me understand if there's consistent interest throughout the year. Sometimes you'll find keywords that spike during certain months - useful information for content planning.  You can also search up your keyword in reddit/X or similar platforms and see if users have shown interest around the topic.

Only after a keyword passes all these checks do I create content around it. This method helps find keywords that:

* Have actual search volume (confirmed by Keyword Planner)
* Show growing interest (year-over-year increase)
* Have less competition (since they appear as zero volume in Semrush)
* Show real user interest (verified by Google Trends)

I've found this method particularly useful for finding long-tail keywords that bigger websites often miss. These keywords might have lower search volume, but they often convert better because they're more specific to what users want.

A real example might help: Instead of targeting highly competitive keywords like ""best coffee machine,"" you might find that ""coffee machine water tank cleaning"" shows zero volume in Semrush but gets steady monthly searches in Keyword Planner, with increasing year-over-year interest.

In addition to finding keywords, when you finalise terms, before you write on those, you need to identify the relevant enitites that you need to mention. You can use tools like surferSEO or you can do it manually.

Here is how to do it manually.

\- Go to Google and type in ""refined KW.""

\- After you search, you might see bubbles or suggestions at the top or bottom of the search results. These are related queries that people often search for.

\- Click on one of these suggested queries.

\- Look at the new search results and note any important words or phrases you see. These might include specific features, brands, or types.

\- Go back to the original search and click on another bubble, and note down the key terms you find.

\- Gather all the important terms from the bubbles.

\- Group similar terms together to see what theme emerge. 

You can also see the theme of a particular SERP by analyzing the PAA. When writing down the content, you should answer these questions naturally throughout as these satisfies the user intent.

I hope this helps. I have other keyword research techniques but this one is relatively easy and implementable.",20,1734958261.0,SEO,11,0.88,False

I had a friend recommend a recipe for doing this - and it worked well, but it included three pours after the bloom. So I set out to accomplish a similar flavor profile with a longer/larger bloom and only one pour after, and I finally managed to do so, but what jumped out at me when doing a side-by-side of the two brew recipes was the drastically different bodies of the two cups.

The recipe with three pours yielded a lighter body - not all the way to tea-like, but getting there. But then the recipe with one bloom and one pour had a significantly fuller body - almost more reminiscent of some fermented coffees I've had.

So ultimately, my question is WHY?? I really enjoy coffees with more body so understanding what causes this would but fun/helpful to know.",3,1734958246.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I was luckily able to sell the house for a little under what I paid for it which meant I had plenty of money to buy my new house just outside of Fastello which was much cheaper due to the much smaller size of the land it sits on.

I was also able to secure a workshop on the outskirts of Fastello which I bought with the remaining money and still had some left over to give back to the bank, while nearly halving my overheads! So keep your eyes peeled as there may be a new little workshop coming to Fastello!

  - His grandmother tried setting us up, though I’d seen him in August at a public gig with his arms around a woman and kissing her. His grandma believed he was single at the time.
  - In September 2023, we had a lunch his grandmother had organised, and I met his whole family. I added him on Facebook afterward but didn’t message.
  - During my holiday a few weeks later we had planned to have a lunch with family friends and his grandparents, he invited himself. He drove 1.5 hours after work on a Saturday and stayed for 6 hours. He had only met my family once and knew no one else but his grandparents. Made a real effort to talk 1:1 to me. 
  - A few weeks later, I invited him to low-key family friend group monthly picnics. He attended three (October, November, December 2023), always sat next to me, stole glances, sent flirty emojis, and shared music recommendations.  
  - Despite his apparent interest, he rarely asked about me and gave conflicting information - being lactose intolerant but drinking full-cream milk etc 
  - After the December picnic, he left my messages on read and didn’t reach out. We didn’t talk until the NY when I messaged him. 
  - In January, he declined attending a picnic due to the flu. In February, he said he was busy but promised to come in March but didn’t show up.  
  - By March, he took up to a week to reply, and I decided to take a break from reaching out.  
  - In late May, I asked him for coffee. He excitedly agreed but oddly suggested meeting at the children’s hospital….  During the meeting, he spent 2 hours sharing personal struggles and insisted on paying for my coffee.
  - Communication improved briefly afterward but his reply times got worse. 
  - I invited him to various activities after (coffee, group events), but he declined every time.  
  - Despite declining meetups, he kept the conversation going online, asking about my health and family etc 
  - By mid-August, I’d only seen him once in 2024 despite regular online chats.  
- he was now taking 7-14 days to reply. His replies were 1-3 sentences. 
  - I messaged him in mid August  expressing confusion 
  - He initially asked if the issue was his reply times. When I clarified, he became dismissive, stating he had no obligations to me, didn’t appreciate being told what to do and accused me of causing unnecessary stress.  
  - I replied reiterating my concern about not meeting up. He then blocked me! I cried. It’s now been 4 months since the block 

I never pressured him into dates or discussed feelings.

Thing is my day at work cannot happen without caffeine. Not possible. And I cannot take shots of ristretto and go on. I need half a litre of coffee that I drink throughout the morning, and green tea in the afternoon.

I actually didn't follow the guidelines from day one, so I am your guinea pig:  
  
Here is what I do:

\- Drink with a straw (this is something I implemented long before invisalign as I find it impossible to keep teeth white otherwise). I personnally use glass straw.

\- Drink pure drinks: be it coffee or tea, it should be without sugar or milk. No calories - > no cavities.  
\- Brush teeth at every meal, including lunch, and brush your aligners.  
\- Drink water along your special drink

\- Don't drink it boiling hot, but comfortably warm is fine. 

random infos:   
\- Pure drinks do no contain the necessary calories to feed the bacteria.  
\- Polyphenols in tea are actually antimicrobian.  
\- Acidity level is quite milld:   
coffee: PH: 4.5-5.5  
tea: ph5-7  
If you combine this with a mineralizing tooth paste (I recommend apagard royal with 10% hydroxyapatite) you reduce the risks of demineralization.   
Do not drink ""sugarfree"" sodas, they are extremely acidic.

what about stain ? it might stain yes. but only the back of your teeth if anything. Stain isn't anything unhealthy. You can just get rid of it during your hygienist appointment and at the end of your treatment.   
I haven't experienced aligners getting stained but I am on a 5 days change. If you see it getting a bit yellowish then you can stop anytime. It's not like a life and death experiment :)

I got 2 days of Fairly relaxed activity before the holiday festivity chaos begins. So I'm going to milk it for all it's worth. Do have a bit of housekeeping to do. So figured I'd pop on here and see if anyone was up for a bit of chat. I got a nice warm coffee and some good music playing. What kind of music do you play when you relax? I'm always taking recommendations for new music.

So anyways, anyone who feels up for a bit of conversation, go right ahead and feel free to hit me up for a chat. I'm pretty chill and like to talk about whatever so any topic is good, anything from simple chit chat to deep conversations about the universe. Hopes and dreams, venting sessions about that one person at work, or even just talking about our day. Doesn't matter who you are where you're from, just please be an adult. 

I do read a lot, and love science fiction , and horror. Enjoy being outdoors, will probably go for a walk in the snow later today. I do watch anime and play video games though mostly single player ones. I like learning about music. Hope to hear from you soon!",1,1734956948.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Sacha, a semi-pro chess player, lives a comfortable life with his girlfriend, Eve. He's one of the top chess players in his town, with a FIDE rating of 2350. Despite his average academic performance in college, he's secured a high-paying job alongside his chess career, steadily progressing towards financial independence. While not much of a party-goer, Sacha's internet celebrity friends frequently invite him to lavish house parties.

One evening, Sacha attends a fancy house party hosted by an older B-list Celebrity. As he mingles near the DJ booth, his voice is accidentally picked up by the microphone. Out of context, his words sound unintentionally sexist.The Celebrity host, irked that Sacha never greeted him, seizes this opportunity to create a scene. ""Did you hear what he said?"" the Celebrity exclaims, pointing at Sacha. ""That kind of talk isn't welcome here. Security, escort him out!"". Confused and frustrated, Sacha leaves the party, and tries to forget the whole incident.

# MIDDLEGAME

At his next chess tournament, Sacha notices peculiar men in the audience wearing bright green and purple clothes. They seem to be signaling to him during his games. Distracted, Sacha's performance suffers. In the following tournament, Sacha decides to ignore these strange spectators. His focus pays off as he plays brilliantly, upsetting higher-rated favorites and winning the tournament. However, his success draws unwanted attention. A famous chess YouTuber analyzes Sacha's games and notices his suspiciously high accuracy rate (99.4%) against a high-rated opponent. The YouTuber also spots the oddly-dressed men in the audience and concludes: Sacha must be cheating. The accusations spread like wildfire across social media platforms. Even FIDE, the international chess governing body, launches an investigation. Weeks later, they announce a shocking decision: Sacha is suspended, and his ranking invalidated due to suspected cheating.

# BLUNDER

Sacha's world crumbles. He receives thousands of hate messages, and both he and Eve face constant harassment. To make matters worse, a video emerges from the B-list Celebrity's party, showing Sacha's out-of-context ""sexist"" remarks and his ejection from the event. Tabloid websites pounce on the story, publishing sensationalized articles: ""Chess prodigy loses it all due to cheating, toxic masculinity, and drugs"" – fabricating the drug angle for added drama. When the story reaches Eve's conservative family, they're outraged. ""Eve, you need to leave him immediately,"" her mother insists during a tense phone call. Torn and confused, Eve tells Sacha she needs some time away and stays at a friend's place.

Days later, Sacha sits hunched over his laptop, a glass of whiskey in hand, playing on Chess.com. His Elo rating has plummeted from a peak of 2500 to fluctuating between 1400 and 1800, depending on his level of inebriation. Mid-game, Sacha pauses and lets out a crazed laugh, staring at the ceiling. His timer runs out, and his Elo drops to a career-low 1362.

# ENDGAME

Convinced that someone orchestrated his downfall, Sacha turns to darker tactics. He creates a spreadsheet listing potential suspects and devises strategies to expose them. He launches a YouTube channel, spreading conspiracy theories and making offensive statements to bait his ""enemies"" into revealing themselves. His behavior alienates friends and family, who begin to openly criticize him online. ""What happened to you, Sacha?"" a former friend comments. ""You've lost your mind!""

As Sacha eliminates suspects one by one, he narrows it down to two names. The B-list Celebrity from the party tops his list of suspects. Sacha hires a YouTube detective to investigate. After weeks of digging, they uncover a crucial clue: the Celebrity was behind the mysterious green and purple-clad men at the chess tournaments.

# CHECKMATE!

Armed with evidence, Sacha and the detective confront the Celebrity. Under pressure, the Celebrity breaks down and reveals the entire scheme. ""You ignored me at my own party!"" he shouts. ""Do you know how that made me feel? I wanted to destroy you!"" The Celebrity admits to manipulating Eve into providing information about Sacha, which he then twisted to feed to the tabloids. Sacha records the confession and shares it with FIDE, who clear his name and reinstate his rating. Sacha shuts down his controversial YouTube channel, explaining it was all part of his strategy to bait the real culprit. ""It was a gambit,"" he tells his followers. ""Sometimes in chess, you have to sacrifice pieces to win the game.""

The final scene shows Sacha at home, sipping coffee in his garden while playing on Chess.com. His Elo rating sits at 1860 – not yet back to his peak, but steadily climbing. He looks up at the sky with a smile, ready for his next match.

1hkmnwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hkmnwe/i_35_f_think_about_leaving_my_husband_36_m_after/,I (35 F) think about leaving my husband (36 M) after 18 years. Is this realistic? ,"I have been with my husband for 18 years and I have been at my limit for quite some time. He battles what I believe is undiagnosed depression and ADHD. He also can be very self involved and I’m just the opposite. For example, last year for Mothers Day we home to Canada to visit family, there was no acknowledgment of how much I did as a stay at home Mom, no thank yous, and when I brought this up to him he said “you’re not my mother”. 
I recently was able to get my green card and started working after 8 years of going through the process, and so we had to put our daughter in daycare. Naturally she got sick all the time, and it rocked us emotionally and mentally. He went on to say “I don’t think you going back to work was worth it. We aren’t getting anything out of it” even though I told him I was so incredibly happy to be working again. I told him that I was happy, so we are getting something out of it. My husband isn’t affectionate, never compliments me, or goes out of his way to make me feel any sort of love. His birthday just passed and I got up early to hang balloons and a banner. I got him a card from our daughter and myself. Made him breakfast, got coffee. Later in the evening I presented him with a cake and sparklers. Fast forward to the end of the day, and he basically had resting “meh” face all day. Didn’t say thank you, didn’t smile… just nothing. I have tried to suggest couples counseling, and individual counseling for him and it’s met with radio silence. 

I’ve tried so hard for 18 years. I just want love. Someone to dance in the kitchen with. Someone who enjoys doing family things and doesn’t see it as a burden. Someone to just even once and awhile, tell me they love me. 

I’ve given everything to his happiness. I want to walk away, but can’t even fathom how that would work. We are from Canada and all of our family is back home. I can’t just pack up our daughter and leave. I feel stuck in this marriage and just tell myself one day she will be older and I might be able to find a more supportive partner then. Maybe I just have to bide my time. ",1,1734956667.0,relationship_advice,7,0.67,False

1hkml9z,https://i.redd.it/8c6ykdz2cl8e1.jpeg,Amazed by the Bambino ,"As a pour over coffee drinker, I've been having an espresso itch this year. I debating long with myself whether I'd go with a more ""grown up"" machine from the beginning or get a more affordable one. I'm glad I went with the latter option, as I'm absolutely amazed by the quality of drinks I get. 

I was a barista 20 and some years ago and had some reservations before I got it, but I'm very encouraged by the steamer on it. 

Got an 14-18 IMS basket, a bottomless portafilter and a tamper to go with it and I think they help quite a bit. 

For the grinder I got a J Ultra and it's another positive surprise. 18g. of the store brand medium roast goes in 40 seconds without much effort. My thinking was to get a good and affordable grinder to leave room for an eventual upgrade on the machine. But I think there's years in the Bambino.

I feel so tired of everything, and I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to keep living either. The idea that I will have to carry this trauma forever, it’s memories and it’s long term effects on who I am is just too much. I hate my body, and I hate my mind. The one person I want to reach out to is my mom, yet she was my abuser and it would only bring me more harm. I was isolated from family and friends my whole life, so even though there are a few people who probably really do love me, I can’t bare to reach out to them. I’m so afraid of upsetting them and/or being rejected. I don’t want to spend my entire life punching a clock and working for someone else. I want to feel valued and wanted, and not so tired all of the time. Living a life where I am mentally damaged, physically unfit, constantly being treated like shit and feeling tired from work, and not even being able to move up in life and accomplish anything despite my efforts is all too much. I’m in therapy, and it’s harder to talk about things as an adult than it ever was as a teen. I have a job as a CNA, and I’m about ready to quit. To me, no amount of money is worth the experience of being in intense pain after my shift being barely able to walk, having to be disrespected by my superiors, have residents hit and scratch me, clean piss and shit, and then I get to watch people in their misery as they slowly die in front of me. I’m in college to try to make a life for myself but I struggle so hard with avoiding my homework and procrastination plus perfectionism and the thoughts of “well if I don’t do a good job why try at all”. Then I have a problem with my sleep, where I either don’t sleep enough or I sleep too much. This created a huge imbalance where I am more and more frequently sleeping through my appointments, class, and shifts. I’m watching myself ruin my life and I know I should keep trying but I really want to just throw in the towel and stop living. I want to just close my eyes and never wake up. But then I know there are things that I don’t want to give up. I don’t want to give up on laughing with my friends when things are good. I don’t want to give up on the idea that I might one day make it and be able to have my dream job and a stable and comfortable home, and the ability to travel and see the beauty of the earth. I don’t want to miss out on all the kisses I give to my two cats. I don’t want to miss out on new music, movies, or new games. I just feel like I’m never gonna make it. I feel like I’m embarrassing myself for even trying. I live in a small leaky trailer, my car is totaled and I don’t have money for a new one. Even when I am working full time, I can barely afford groceries or anything else. Sure I could stop buying coffee. I could not buy weed. I could not spend money on little things that I enjoy, but I can’t see the bigger picture. I know it’s true that frugality and saving will make a difference, but in the moment I’m never able to see how being frugal and saving will benefit me in the long run. I’m about to be two months late on rent, and my phone bill is overdue, and now extremely high. I have almost zero self discipline, I constantly chase instant gratification, and I know all I do is make excuses for myself.
