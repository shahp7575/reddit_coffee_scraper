Have you noticed how many things feel... temporary these days?

Buy a coffee grinder — it breaks in six months. A mug — cracks from hot water. A backpack — comes apart at the seams. It’s become normal: things aren’t made to last anymore. They’re made to be bought again.

Mass production cuts material costs, simplifies construction, and marketing tells you why you need it anyway. Repair is rare. Quality has become a style, not a standard.

Handmade work stands in contrast to this. It’s slower, more expensive, less perfect — and that’s its strength. Handmade items have character. They feel real.

I’ve been learning leathercraft and recently finished a new wallet. It turned out much cleaner than my earlier attempts, and I’m starting to really enjoy the process. You’re not just making an object — you’re creating something with a story.

1lo1zfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lo1zfd/the_talisman_by_stephen_king/,The Talisman by Stephen King:,"On September 15th, 1981, a boy named Jack Sawyer stood where the water and land come together, hands in the pockets of his jeans, looking out at the steady Atlantic. He was twelve years old and tall for his age. The sea-breeze swept back his brown hair, probably too long, from a fine, clear brow. He stood there, filled with the confused and painful emotions he had lived with for the last three months--since the time when his mother had closed their house on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles and, in a flurry of furniture, checks, and real-estate agents, rented an apartment on Central Park West. From that apartment they had fled to this quiet resort on New Hampshire's tiny seacoast. Order and regularity had disappeared from Jack's world. His life seemed as shifting, as uncontrolled, as the heaving water before him. His mother was moving him through the world, twitching him from place to place; but what moved his mother?  
  
  His mother was running, running.  
  
  Jack turned around, looking up the empty beach first to the left, then to the right. To the left was Arcadia Funworld, an amusement park that ran all racket and roar from Memorial Day to Labor Day. It stood empty and still now, a heart between beats. The roller coaster was a scaffold against that featureless, overcast sky, the uprights and angled supports like strokes done in charcoal. Down there was his new friend, Speedy Parker, but the boy could not think about Speedy Parker now. To the right was the Alhambra Inn and Gardens, and that was where the boy's thoughts relentlessly took him. On the day of their arrival Jack had momentarily thought he'd seen a rainbow over its dormered and gambreled roof. A sign of sorts, a promise of better things. But there had been no rainbow. A weathervane spun right-left, left-right, caught in a crosswind. He had got out of their rented car, ignoring his mother's unspoken desire for him to do something about the luggage, and looked up. Above the spinning brass cock of the weathervane hung only a blank sky.  
  
  ""Open the trunk and get the bags, sonny boy,"" his mother had called to him. ""  
This broken-down old actress wants to check in and hunt down a drink.""  
  
  ""An elementary martini,"" Jack had said.  
  
  "" 'You're not so old,' you were supposed to say."" She was pushing herself effortfully off the carseat.  
  
  ""You're not so old.""  
  
  She gleamed at him--a glimpse of the old, go-to-hell Lily Cavanaugh (Sawyer), queen of two decades' worth of B movies. She straightened her back. ""It's going to be okay here, Jacky,"" she had said. ""Everything's going to be okay here. This is a good place.""  
  
  A seagull drifted over the roof of the hotel, and for a second Jack had the disquieting sensation that the weathervane had taken flight.  
  
  ""We'll get away from the phone calls for a while, right?""  
  
  ""Sure,"" Jack had said. She wanted to hide from Uncle Morgan, she wanted no more wrangles with her dead husband's business partner, she wanted to crawl into bed with an elementary martini and hoist the covers over her head. . . .  
  
  Mom, what's wrong with you?  
  
  There was too much death, the world was half-made of death. The gull cried out overhead.  
  
  ""Andelay, kid, andelay,"" his mother had said. ""Let's get into the Great Good Place.""  
  
  Then, Jack had thought: At least there's always Uncle Tommy to help out in case things get really hairy.  
  
  But Uncle Tommy was already dead; it was just that the news was still on the other end of a lot of telephone wires.  
  
  2  
  
  The Alhambra hung out over the water, a great Victorian pile on gigantic granite blocks which seemed to merge almost seamlessly with the low headland--a jutting collarbone of granite here on the few scant miles of New Hampshire seacoast. The formal gardens on its landward side were barely visible from Jack's beachfront angle--a dark green flip of hedge, that was all. The brass cock stood against the sky, quartering west by northwest. A plaque in the lobby announced that it was here, in 1838, that the Northern Methodist Conference had held the first of the great New England abolition rallies. Daniel Webster had spoken at fiery, inspired length. According to the plaque, Webster had said: ""From this day forward, know that slavery as an American institution has begun to sicken and must soon die in all our states and territorial lands.""  
  
  3  
  
  So they had arrived, on that day last week which had ended the turmoil of their months in New York. In Arcadia Beach there were no lawyers employed by Morgan Sloat popping out of cars and waving papers which had to be signed, had to be filed, Mrs. Sawyer. In Arcadia Beach the telephones did not ring out from noon until three in the morning (Uncle Morgan appeared to forget that residents of Central Park West were not on California time). In fact the telephones in Arcadia Beach rang not at all.  
  
  On the way into the little resort town, his mother driving with squinty-eyed concentration, Jack had seen only one person on the streets--a mad old man desultorily pushing an empty shopping cart along a sidewalk. Above them was that blank gray sky, an uncomfortable sky. In total contrast to New York, here there was only the steady sound of the wind, hooting up deserted streets that looked much too wide with no traffic to fill them. Here were empty shops with signs in the windows saying OPEN WEEKENDS ONLY or, even worse, SEE YOU IN JUNE! There were a hundred empty parking places on the street before the Alhambra, empty tables in the Arcadia Tea and Jam Shoppe next door.  
  
  And shabby-crazy old men pushed shopping carts along deserted streets.  
  
  ""I spent the happiest three weeks of my life in this funny little place,"" Lily told him, driving past the old man (who turned, Jack saw, to look after them with frightened suspicion--he was mouthing something but Jack could not tell what it was) and then swinging the car up the curved drive through the front gardens of the hotel.  
  
  For that was why they had bundled everything they could not live without into suitcases and satchels and plastic shopping bags, turned the key in the lock on the apartment door (ignoring the shrill ringing of the telephone, which seemed to penetrate that same keyhole and pursue them down the hall); that was why they had filled the trunk and back seat of the rented car with all their overflowing boxes and bags and spent hours crawling north along the Henry Hudson Parkway, then many more hours pounding up I-95--because Lily Cavanaugh Sawyer had once been happy here. In 1968, the year before Jack's birth, Lily had been nominated for an Academy Award for her role in a picture called Blaze. Blaze was a better movie than most of Lily's, and in it she had been able to demonstrate a much richer talent than her usual bad-girl roles had revealed. Nobody expected Lily to win, least of all Lily; but for Lily the customary cliche about the real honor being in the nomination was honest truth--she did feel honored, deeply and genuinely, and to celebrate this one moment of real professional recognition, Phil Sawyer had wisely taken her for three weeks to the Alhambra Inn and Gardens, on the other side of the continent, where they had watched the Oscars while drinking champagne in bed. (If Jack had been older, and had he had an occasion to care, he might have done the necessary subtraction and discovered that the Alhambra had been the place of his essential beginning.)  
  
  When the Supporting Actress nominations were read, according to family legend, Lily had growled to Phil, ""If I win this thing and I'm not there, I'll do the Monkey on your chest in my stiletto heels.""  
  
  But when Ruth Gordon had won, Lily had said, ""Sure, she deserves it, she's a great kid."" And had immediately poked her husband in the middle of the chest and said, ""You'd better get me another part like that, you big-shot agent you.""  
  
  There had been no more parts like that. Lily's last role, two years after Phil's death, had been that of a cynical ex-prostitute in a film called Motorcycle Maniacs.  
  
  It was that period Lily was commemorating now, Jack knew as he hauled the baggage out of the trunk and the back seat. A D' Agostino bag had torn right down through the big D'AG, and a jumble of rolled-up socks, loose photographs, chessmen and the board, and comic books had dribbled over all else in the trunk. Jack managed to get most of this stuff into other bags. Lily was moving slowly up the hotel steps, pulling herself along on the railing like an old lady. ""I'll find the bellhop,"" she said without turning around.  
  
  Jack straightened up from the bulging bags and looked again at the sky where he was sure he had seen a rainbow. There was no rainbow, only that uncomfortable, shifting sky.  
  
  Then:  
  
  ""Come to me,"" someone said behind him in a small and perfectly audible voice.  
  
  ""What?"" he asked, turning around. The empty gardens and drive stretched out before him.  
  
  ""Yes?"" his mother said. She looked crickle-backed, leaning over the knob of the great wooden door.  
  
  ""Mistake,"" he said. There had been no voice, no rainbow. He forgot both and looked up at his mother, who was struggling with the vast door. ""Hold on, I'll help,"" he called, and trotted up the steps, awkwardly carrying a big suitcase and a straining paper bag filled with sweaters.  
  
  4  
  
  Until he met Speedy Parker, Jack had moved through the days at the hotel as unconscious of the passage of time as a sleeping dog. His entire life seemed almost dreamlike to him during these days, full of shadows and inexplicable transitions. Even the terrible news about Uncle Tommy which had come down the telephone wires the night before had not entirely awakened him, as shocking as it had been. If Jack had been a mystic, he might have thought that other forces had taken him over and were manipulating his mother's life and his own. Jack Sawyer at twelve was a being who required things to do, and the noiseless passivity of these days, after the hubbub of Manhattan, had confused and undone him in some basic way.  
  
  Jack had found himself standing on the beach with no recollection of having gone there, no idea of what he was doing there at all. He supposed he was mourning Uncle Tommy, but it was as though his mind had gone to sleep, leaving his body to fend for itself. He could not concentrate long enough to grasp the plots of the sitcoms he and Lily watched at night, much less keep the nuances of fiction in his head.  
  
  ""You're tired from all this moving around,"" his mother said, dragging deeply on a cigarette and squinting at him through the smoke  
. ""All you have to do, Jack-O, is relax for a little while. This is a good place. Let's enjoy it as long as we can.""  
  
  Bob Newhart, before them in a slightly too-reddish color on the set, bemusedly regarded a shoe he held in his right hand.  
  
  ""That's what I'm doing, Jacky."" She smiled at him. ""Relaxing and enjoying it.""  
  
  He peeked at his watch. Two hours had passed while they sat in front of the television, and he could not remember anything that had preceded this program.  
  
  Jack was getting up to go to bed when the phone rang. Good old Uncle Morgan Sloat had found them. Uncle Morgan's news was never very great, but this was apparently a blockbuster even by Uncle Morgan's standards. Jack stood in the middle of the room, watching as his mother's face grew paler, palest. Her hand crept to her throat, where new lines had appeared over the last few months, and pressed lightly. She said barely a word until the end, when she whispered, ""Thank you, Morgan,"" and hung up. She had turned to Jack then, looking older and sicker than ever.  
  
  ""Got to be tough now, Jacky, all right?""  
  
  He hadn't felt tough.  
  
  She took his hand then and told him.  
  
  ""Uncle Tommy was killed in a hit-and-run accident this afternoon, Jack.""  
  
  He gasped, feeling as if the wind had been torn out of him.  
  
  ""He was crossing La Cienega Boulevard and a van hit him. There was a witness who said it was black, and that the words WILD CHILD were written on the side, but that was . . . was all.""  
  
  Lily began to cry. A moment later, almost surprised, Jack began to cry as well. All of that had happened three days ago, and to Jack it seemed forever.  
  
  5  
  
  On September 15th, 1981, a boy named Jack Sawyer stood looking out at the steady water as he stood on an unmarked beach before a hotel that looked like a castle in a Sir Walter Scott novel. He wanted to cry but was unable to release his tears. He was surrounded by death, death made up half the world, there were no rainbows. The WILD CHILD van had subtracted Uncle Tommy from the world. Uncle Tommy, dead in L.A., too far from the east coast, where even a kid like Jack knew he really belonged. A man who felt he had to put on a tie before going out to get a roast beef sandwich at Arby's had no business on the west coast at all.

 His father was dead, Uncle Tommy was dead, his mother might be dying. He felt death here, too, at Arcadia Beach, where it spoke through telephones in Uncle Morgan's voice. It was nothing as cheap or obvious as the melancholy feel of a resort in the off-season, where one kept stumbling over the Ghosts of Summers Past; it seemed to be in the texture of things, a smell on the ocean breeze. He was scared . . . and he had been scared for a long time. Being here, where it was so quiet, had only helped him to realize it--had helped him to realize that maybe Death had driven all the way up I-95 from New York, squinting out through cigarette smoke and asking him to find some bop on the car radio.  
  
  He could remember--vaguely--his father telling him that he was born with an old head, but his head didn't feel old now. Right now, his head felt very young. Scared, he thought. I'm pretty damn scared. This is where the world ends, right?  
  
  Seagulls coursed the gray air overhead. The silence was as gray as the air--as deadly as the growing circles under her eyes.  
  
  6  
  
  When he had wandered into Funworld and met Lester Speedy Parker after he did not quite know how many days of numbly drifting through time, that passive feeling of being on hold had somehow left him. Lester Parker was a black man with crinkly gray hair and heavy lines cutting through his cheeks. He was utterly unremarkable now despite whatever he had accomplished in his earlier life as a travelling blues musician. Nor had he said anything particularly remarkable. Yet as soon as Jack had walked aimlessly into Funworld's game arcade and met Speedy's pale eyes he felt all the fuzziness leave him. He had become himself again. It was as if a magical current had passed directly from the old man into Jack. Speedy had smiled at him and said, ""Well, it looks like I got me some company. Little travellin man just walked in.""  
  
  It was true, he was not on hold anymore: just an instant before, he had seemed to be wrapped in wet wool and cotton candy, and now he was set free. A silvery nimbus seemed to play about the old man for an instant, a little aureole of light which disappeared as soon as Jack blinked. For the first time Jack saw that the man was holding the handle of a wide heavy push-broom.  
  
  ""You okay, son?"" The handyman put one hand in the small of his back, and stretched backward. ""The world just get worse, or did she get better?""  
  
  ""Uh, better,"" Jack said.  
  
  ""Then you come to the right place, I'd say. What do they call you?""  
  
  Little travellin man, Speedy had said that first day, ole Travellin Jack. He had leaned his tall angular body against the Skee-Ball machine and wrapped his arms around the broom-handle as though it were a girl at a dance. The man you see here is Lester Speedy Parker, formerly a travellin man hisself, son, hee hee--oh yeah, Speedy knew the road, he knew all the roads, way back in the old days. Had me a band, Travellin Jack, played the blues. Git-tar blues. Made me a few records, too, but I won't shame you by asking if you ever heard em. Every syllable had its own rhythmic lilt, every phrase its rimshot and backbeat; Speedy Parker carried a broom instead of a guitar, but he was still a musician. Within the first five seconds of talking to Speedy, Jack had known that his jazz-loving father would have relished this man's company.  
  
  He had tagged along behind Speedy for the better part of three or four days, watching him work and helping out when he could. Speedy let him bang in nails, sand down a picket or two that needed paint; these simple tasks done under Speedy's instructions were the only schooling he was getting, but they made him feel better. Jack now saw his first days in Arcadia Beach as a period of unrelieved wretchedness from which his new friend had rescued him. For Speedy Parker was a friend, that was certain--so certain, in fact, that in it was a quantity of mystery. In the few days since Jack had shaken off his daze (or since Speedy had shaken it off for him by dispelling it with one glance of his light-colored eyes), Speedy Parker had become closer to him than any other friend, with the possible exception of Richard Sloat, whom Jack had known approximately since the cradle. And now, counteracting his terror at losing Uncle Tommy and his fear that his mother was actually dying, he felt the tug of Speedy's warm wise presence from just down the street.  
  
  Again, and uncomfortably, Jack had his old sense of being directed, of being manipulated: as if a long invisible wire had pulled himself and his mother up to this abandoned place by the sea.  
  
  They wanted him here, whoever they were.  
  
  Or was that just crazy? In his inner vision he saw a bent old man, clearly out of his mind, muttering to himself as he pushed an empty shopping cart down the sidewalk.  
  
  A gull screamed in the air, and Jack promised himself that he would make himself talk about some of his feelings with Speedy Parker. Even if Speedy thought he was nuts; even if he laughed at Jack. He would not laugh, Jack secretly knew. They were old friends because one of the things Jack understood about the old custodian was that he could say almost anything to him.  
  
  But he was not ready for all that yet. It was all too crazy, and he did not understand it yet himself. Almost reluctantly Jack turned his back on Funworld and trudged across the sand toward the hotel.

  The Funnel Opens  
  
  1  
  
  It was a day later, but Jack Sawyer was no wiser. He had, however, had one of the greatest nightmares of all time last night. In it, some terrible creature had been coming for his mother--a dwarfish monstrosity with misplaced eyes and rotting, cheesy skin. ""Your mother's almost dead, Jack, can you say hallelujah?"" this monstrosity had croaked, and Jack knew--the way you knew things in dreams--that it was radioactive, and that if it touched him, he would die, too. He had awakened with his body drenched in sweat, on the edge of a bitter scream. It took the steady pounding of the surf to reacquaint him with where he was, and it was hours before he could go back to sleep.  
  
  He had meant to tell his mother about the dream this morning, but Lily had been sour and uncommunicative, hiding in a cloud of cigarette smoke. It was only as he started out of the hotel coffee shop on some trumped-up errand that she smiled at him a little.  
  
  ""Think about what you want to eat tonight.""  
  
  ""Yeah?""  
  
  ""Yeah. Anything but fast food. I did not come all the way from L.A. to New Hampshire in order to poison myself with hotdogs.""  
  
  ""Let's try one of those seafood places in Hampton Beach,"" Jack said.  
  
  ""Fine. Go on and play.""  
  
  Go on and play, Jack thought with a bitterness utterly unlike him. Oh yeah, Mom, way to go. Too cool. Go on and play. With who? Mom, why are you here? Why are we here? How sick are you? How come you won't talk to me about Uncle Tommy? What's Uncle Morgan up to? What--  
  
  Questions, questions. And not one of them worth a darned thing, because there was no one to answer them.  
  
  Unless Speedy--  
  
  But that was ridiculous; how could one old black man he'd just met solve any of his problems?  
  
  Still, the thought of Speedy Parker danced at the edge of his mind as Jack ambled across the boardwalk and down to the depressingly empty beach.  
  
  2  
  
  This is where the world ends, right? Jack thought again.  
  
  Seagulls coursed the gray air overhead. The calendar said it was still summer, but summer ended here at Arcadia Beach on Labor Day. The silence was gray as the air.  
  
  He looked down at his sneakers and saw that there was some sort of tarry goo on them. Beach crud, he thought. Some kind of pollution. He had no idea where he had picked it up and he stepped back from the edge of the water, uneasy.  
  
  The gulls in the air, swooping and crying. One of them screamed overhead and he heard a flat cracking that was almost metallic. He turned in time to see it come in for a fluttering, awkward landing on a hump of rock. The gull turned its head in rapid, almost robotic movements, as if to verify it was alone, and then it hopped down to where the clam it had dropped lay on the smooth, hard-packed sand. The clam had cracked open like an egg and Jack saw raw meat inside, still twitching . . . or perhaps that was his imagination.  
  
  Don't want to see this.  
  
  But before he could turn away, the gull's yellow,  
hooked beak was pulling at the meat, stretching it like a rubber band, and he felt his stomach knot into a slick fist. In his mind he could hear that stretched tissue screaming--nothing coherent, only stupid flesh crying out in pain.  
  
  He tried to look away from the seagull again and he couldn't. The gull's beak opened, giving him a brief glimpse of dirty pink gullet. The clam snapped back into its cracked shell and for a moment the gull was looking at him, its eyes a deadly black, confirming every horrible truth: fathers die, mothers die, uncles die even if they went to Yale and look as solid as bank walls in their three-piece Savile Row suits. Kids die too, maybe . . . and at the end all there may be is the stupid, unthinking scream of living tissue.  
  
  ""Hey,"" Jack said aloud, not aware he was doing anything but thinking inside his own head. ""Hey, give me a break.""  
  
  The gull sat over its catch, regarding him with its beady black eyes. Then it began to dig at the meat again. Want some, Jack? It's still twitching! By God, it's so fresh it hardly knows it's dead!  
  
  The strong yellow beak hooked into the meat again and pulled. Strettttchhhhhh--  
  
  It snapped. The gull's head went up toward the gray September sky and its throat worked. And again it seemed to be looking at him, the way the eyes in some pictures seemed always to look at you no matter where you went in the room. And the eyes . . . he knew those eyes.  
  
  Suddenly he wanted his mother--her dark blue eyes. He could not remember wanting her with such desperation since he had been very, very small. La-la, he heard her sing inside his head, and her voice was the wind's voice, here for now, somewhere else all too soon. La-la, sleep now, Jacky, baby-bunting, daddy's gone a-hunting. And all that jazz. Memories of being rocked, his mother smoking one Herbert Tareyton after another, maybe looking at a script--blue pages, she called them, he remembered that: blue pages. La-la, Jacky, all is cool. I love you, Jacky. Shhh . . . sleep. La-la.  
  
  The gull was looking at him.  
  
  With sudden horror that engorged his throat like hot salt water he saw it really was looking at him. Those black eyes (whose?) were seeing him. And he knew that look.  
  
  A raw strand of flesh still dangled from the gull's beak. As he looked, the gull sucked it in. Its beak opened in a weird but unmistakable grin.  
  
  He turned then and ran, head down, eyes shut against the hot salt tears, sneakers digging against the sand, and if there was a way to go up, go up and up, up to some gull's-eye view, one would have seen only him, only his tracks, in all that gray day; Jack Sawyer, twelve and alone, running back toward the inn, Speedy Parker forgotten, his voice nearly lost in tears and wind, crying the negative over and over again: no and no and no.  
  
  3  
  
  He paused at the top of the beach, out of breath. A hot stitch ran up his left side from the middle of his ribs to the deepest part of his armpit. He sat down on one of the benches the town put out for old people and pushed his hair out of his eyes.  
  
  Got to get control of yourself. If Sergeant Fury goes Section Eight, who's gonna lead the Howling Commandos?  
  
  He smiled and actually did feel a little better. From up here, fifty feet from the water, things looked a little better. Maybe it was the change in barometric pressure, or something. What had happened to Uncle Tommy was horrible, but he supposed he would get over it, learn to accept. That was what his mother said, anyway. Uncle Morgan had been unusually pesty just lately, but then, Uncle Morgan had always been sort of a pest.  
  
  As for his mother . . . well, that was the big one, wasn't it?  
  
  Actually, he thought, sitting on the bench and digging at the verge of the sand beyond the boardwalk with one toe, actually his mother might still be all right. She could be all right; it was certainly possible. After all, no one had come right out and said it was the big C, had they? No. If she had cancer, she wouldn't have brought him here, would she? More likely they'd be in Switzerland, with his mother taking cold mineral baths and scoffing goat-glands, or something. And she would do it, too.  
  
  So maybe--  
  
  A low, dry whispering sound intruded on his consciousness. He looked down and his eyes widened. The sand had begun to move by the instep of his left sneaker. The fine white grains were sliding around in a small circle perhaps a finger's length in diameter. The sand in the middle of this circle suddenly collapsed, so that now there was a dimple in the sand. It was maybe two inches deep. The sides of this dimple were also in motion: around and around, moving in rapid counterclockwise circuits.  
  
  Not real, he told himself immediately, but his heart began to speed up again. His breathing also began to come faster. Not real, it's one of the Daydreams, that's all, or maybe it's a crab or something . . .  
  
  But it wasn't a crab and it wasn't one of the Daydreams--this was not the other place, the one he dreamed about when things were boring or maybe a little scary, and it sure as hell wasn't any crab.  
  
  The sand spun faster, the sound arid and dry, making him think of static electricity, of an experiment they had done in science last year with a Leyden jar. But more than either of these, the minute sound was like a long lunatic gasp, the final breath of a dying man.  
  
  More sand collapsed inward and began to spin. Now it was not a dimple; it was a funnel in the sand, a kind of reverse dust-devil. The bright yellow of a gum wrapper was revealed, covered, revealed, covered, revealed again--each time it showed up again. Jack could read more of it as the funnel grew: JU, then JUI, then JUICY F. The funnel grew and the sand was jerked away from the gum wrapper again. It was as quick and rude as an unfriendly hand jerking down the covers on a made bed. JUICY FRUIT, he read, and then the wrapper flapped upward.  
  
  The sand turned faster and faster, in a hissing fury. Hhhhhhaaaaahhhhhhhh was the sound the sand made. Jack stared at it, fascinated at first, and then horrified. The sand was opening like a large dark eye: it was the eye of the gull that had dropped the clam on the rock and then pulled the living meat out of it like a rubber band.  
  
  Hhhhhhaaaahhhhh, the sand-spout mocked in its dead, dry voice. That was not a mind-voice. No matter how much Jack wished it were only in his head, that voice was real. His false teeth flew, Jack, when the old WILD CHILD hit him, out they went, rattledy-bang! Yale or no Yale, when the old WILD CHILD van comes and knocks your false teeth out, Jacky, you got to go. And your mother--  
  
  Then he was running again, blindly, not looking back, his hair blown off his forehead, his eyes wide and terrified.  
  
  4  
  
  Jack walked as quickly as he could through the dim lobby of the hotel. All the atmosphere of the place forbade running: it was as quiet as a library, and the gray light which fell through the tall mullioned windows softened and blurred the already faded carpets. Jack broke into a trot as he passed the desk, and the stooped ashen-skinned day-clerk chose that second to emerge through an arched wooden passage. The clerk said nothing, but his permanent scowl dragged the corners of his mouth another centimeter downward. It was like being caught running in church. Jack wiped his sleeve across his forehead, made himself walk the rest of the way to the elevators. He punched the button, feeling the desk clerk's frown burning between his shoulder blades. The only time this week that Jack had seen the desk clerk smile had been when the man had recognized his mother. The smile had met only the minimum standards for graciousness.  
  
  ""I suppose that's how old you have to be to remember Lily Cavanaugh,"" she had said to Jack as soon as they were alone in their rooms. There had been a time, and not so long ago, when being identified, recognized from any one of the fifty movies she had made during the fifties and sixties (""Queen of the Bs,"" they called her; her own comment: ""Darling of the Drive-ins"")--whether by a cabdriver, waiter, or the lady selling blouses at the Wilshire Boulevard Saks--perked her mood for hours. Now even that simple pleasure had gone dry for her.  
  
  Jack jigged before the unmoving elevator doors, hearing an impossible and familiar voice lifting to him from a whirling funnel of sand. For a second he saw Thomas Woodbine, solid comfortable Uncle Tommy Woodbine, who was supposed to have been one of his guardians--a s  
trong wall against trouble and confusion--crumpled and dead on La Cienega Boulevard, his teeth like popcorn twenty feet away in the gutter. He stabbed the button again.  
  
  Hurry up!  
  
  Then he saw something worse--his mother hauled into a waiting car by two impassive men. Suddenly Jack had to urinate. He flattened his palm against the button, and the bent gray man behind the desk uttered a phlegmy sound of disapproval. Jack pressed the edge of his other hand into that magic place just beneath his stomach which lessened the pressure on his bladder. Now he could hear the slow whir of the descending elevator. He closed his eyes, squeezed his legs together. His mother looked uncertain, lost and confused, and the men forced her into the car as easily as they would a weary collie dog. But that was not really happening, he knew; it was a memory--part of it must have been one of the Daydreams--and it had happened not to his mother but to him.  
  
  As the mahogany doors of the elevator slid away to reveal a shadowy interior from which his own face met him in a foxed and peeling mirror, that scene from his seventh year wrapped around him once again, and he saw one man's eyes turn to yellow, felt the other's hand alter into something clawlike, hard and inhuman . . . he jumped into the elevator as if he had been jabbed with a fork.  
  
  Not possible: the Daydreams were not possible, he had not seen a man's eyes turning from blue to yellow, and his mother was fine and dandy, there was nothing to be scared of, nobody was dying, and danger was what a seagull meant to a clam. He closed his eyes and the elevator toiled upward.  
  
  That thing in the sand had laughed at him.  
  
  Jack squeezed through the opening as soon as the doors began to part. He trotted past the closed mouths of the other elevators, turned right into the panelled corridor and ran past the sconces and paintings toward their rooms. Here running seemed less a sacrilege. They had 407 and 408, consisting of two bedrooms, a small kitchen, and a living room with a view of the long smooth beach and the vastness of the ocean. His mother had appropriated flowers from somewhere, arranged them in vases, and set her little array of framed photographs beside them. Jack at five, Jack at eleven, Jack as an infant in the arms of his father. His father, Philip Sawyer, at the wheel of the old DeSoto he and Morgan Sloat had driven to California in the unimaginable days when they had been so poor they had often slept in the car.

The first time this happened, I thought Oh, she probably finished it at home and just went here because she was bored or something so honestly, I just ignored it. But it happens every time, even when I finish my homework, she doesn't even talk to me and continues watching her Reddit stories, but the annoying thing is, my bed is always made, and she lies down on my bed, ruining everything but she did this the first time she came over like how are you so comfortable in a strangers home??? In the school year, some festivals included cooking/baking to sell to the people going to the festival. I participated in the baking part, and she said she wanted to join me, cool. I bought the ingredients, told her to come over to my house, and guess what? She lies down on the couch and makes me do all the work. I told her, ""Oh, can you help me with this part?"" ""I have to finish this first"". It's honestly annoying because you wanted to help, but now you're not even helping, excuse me? And even now in the summer, I ask her to hang out, like go out for coffee and go to the mall, but when we get to the coffee shop, she just goes on her phone and watches TikTok the entire time and when I talk to her like ask about her day she gives me the SHORTEST ANSWERS like, ""fine, normal, happy"" why did you even accept to hang out anyways If all you're going to do is go on your phone.

1lo1yme,https://i.redd.it/79aexrwtv0af1.png,"My opinion on khamrah qahwa, cdnim pp, detour noir and oud and roses.","
I recently was in search of new fragrances to add in my collection. And based on all the research across youtube and reddit, i decided to buy decants of

Cdnim pp (armaf)
Khamrah qahwa (lataffa)
Detour noir (al harmain)
Oud and roses (ahmed al maghribi)

These 4 fragrances have made me realise that middle eastern fragrances are quite different from ""foreign/desginer"" fragrances. Which I'll get on about later.

Detour noir, is a lovely vanilla fragrance for someone who wants to get into perfumes by a subtle vanilla fragrance with not much character, if you know what I mean.

Khamrah qahwa, it's a lovely fragrance no doubt, and a beast performer. I just did 2 sprays of it and my family in their own rooms could smell it and complimented on how sweet it is. But it's just not what I want. Khamrah qahwa is a damn sweet fragrance and it does have that coffee note which can be perceived as chocolaty.

I asked my friend to give her opinion on it, and she described it as how she imagines a sweet chocolate shop to smell like, like one with sunshine coming through the windows, and a sweet lady handling the counter.
It's a feminine fragrance and not for someone who wants to have that dark vibe like asad or dior sauvage or tom ford vibe.

Cdnim pp, i bought a 5ml decant of it to try a lot, because I had read all reviews abt it saying how it's opening is of a rotten lemon and it needs to grow on you. But it just didn't grow on me, all I could smell was the lemony part. But i think i should let it macerate for a while and then try it again, but I don't think that's the type of person I am to buy a fragrance rn and wait for 6 months to use it to understand how it smells.

Oud and roses is a lovely fragrance, it smells like our mixed in a bowl of roses soaked in gulab jal.
It reminds me of home poojas, like on a festival. It made me like the oud and roses scent, but I think I'd buy something like oud ispahan by dior. And why?

Because desginer fragrances, like say armani, Bvlgari, dior, they all have this smoothness and rich quality in them, one that reminds you of say a rich young guy in Netflix. Uk like movie characters with sophistication.

While middle eastern fragrances have this vibe where the juice quality isn't that rich or smooth. It's quality yes, but it's not just what i expected because well I've grown up with fragrance like acqua di gio, hugo boss, coolwater, Bvlgari night, and etc. and it just feels a very different vibe.

But hey, the price difference is crazy and I'm not trying to hate on middle eastern fragrances, i personally own full bottles of kaaf and asad, and i love them. Given how good they are for their price id surely buy em again.

But just if there are anyone else like me who loves these designer brands and wears their fragrances, i think before you buy a middle eastern fragrance, try it's decants and then make your mind.

1lo1yba,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lo1yba/i_bought_a_haunted_wardrobe_last_night_it/,"I bought a haunted wardrobe. Last night, it whispered my name at 3 AM.","It was supposed to be my dream apartment - a quiet 1BHK in Chennai, just minutes from the beach. The east-facing window brought in the salt air, and the price was unbelievable. I should've known something was wrong when the landlord hesitated before handing over the keys.

The wardrobe came from a musty antique shop near Mount Road. Solid teakwood, Dutch colonial carvings, and that strange scent - like old books and wet earth. The shopkeeper practically begged me to take it. ""Special price only for you, madam,"" he said, avoiding eye contact. ""It needs... the right owner.""

For the first week, it was perfect. Then the noises started.

3:17 AM. That's when it always happens. First just creaking, like someone shifting their weight inside. Then the *knocking* \- three slow raps from within, exactly mimicking how I knock on my office door.

I found the first dead rat on Tuesday morning. Its body was pressed against the back panel like it had been *crushed* trying to escape. The smell... God, the smell was like a seafood market in the monsoon.

Last night was different. Last night it spoke.

""Lisa..."" in my own voice, but distorted, like it was being played through a waterlogged speaker. When I opened the wardrobe, the clothes I'd hung up were *damp*, though it hasn't rained in days. And in the back corner - fingers, bone-white and too long, slowly retracting behind my winter coats.

I'm typing this from a coffee shop. My things are still there. My *phone* is still there, recording right now by the wardrobe. I can see the live feed - the door just swung open by itself.

1lo1xzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lo1xzk/dead_in_the_family_by_charlaine_harris/,Dead in the Family by Charlaine Harris:,"MARCH  
  
  THE FIRST WEEK  
  
  ""I feel bad that I'm leaving you like this,"" Amelia said. Her eyes were puffy and red. They'd been that way, off and on, ever since Tray Dawson's funeral.  
  
  ""You have to do what you have to do,"" I said, giving her a very bright smile. I could read the guilt and shame and ever-present grief roiling around Amelia's mind in a ball of darkness. ""I'm lots better,"" I reassured her. I could hear myself babbling cheerfully along, but I couldn't seem to stop. ""I'm walking okay, and the holes are all filled in. See how much better?"" I pulled down my jeans waistband to show her a spot that had been bitten out. The teeth marks were hardly perceptible, though the skin wasn't quite smooth and was visibly paler than the surrounding flesh. If I hadn't had a huge dose of vampire blood, the scar would've looked like a shark had bitten me.  
  
  Amelia glanced down and hastily away, as if she couldn't bear to see the evidence of the attack. ""It's just that Octavia keeps e-mailing me and telling me I need to come home and accept my judgment from the witches' council, or what's left of it,"" she said in a rush. ""And I need to check all the repairs to my house. And since there are a few tourists again, and people returning and rebuilding, the magic store's reopened. I can work there part-time. Plus, as much as I love you and I love living here, since Tray died . . . ""  
  
  ""Believe me, I understand. "" We'd gone over this a few times.  
  
  ""It's not that I blame you,"" Amelia said, trying to catch my eyes.  
  
  She really didn't blame me. Since I could read her mind, I knew she was telling me the truth.  
  
  Even I didn't totally blame myself, somewhat to my surprise.  
  
  It was true that Tray Dawson, Amelia's lover and a Were, had been killed while he'd been acting as my bodyguard. It was true that I'd requested a bodyguard from the Were pack nearest me because they owed me a favor and my life needed guarding. However, I'd been present at the death of Tray Dawson at the hands of a sword-wielding fairy, and I knew who was responsible.  
  
  So I didn't feel guilty, exactly. But I felt heartsick about losing Tray, on top of all the other horrors. My cousin Claudine, a full-blooded fairy, had also died in the Fae War, and since she'd been my real, true fairy godmother, I missed her in a lot of ways. And she'd been pregnant.  
  
  I had a lot of pain and regret of all kinds, physical and mental. While Amelia carried an armful of clothes downstairs, I stood in her bedroom, gathering myself. Then I braced my shoulders and lifted a box of bathroom odds and ends. I descended the stairs carefully and slowly, and I made my way out to her car. She turned from depositing the clothes across the boxes already stowed in her trunk. ""You shouldn't be doing that!"" she said, all anxious concern. ""You're not healed yet. ""  
  
  ""I'm fine. ""  
  
  ""Not hardly. You always jump when someone comes into the room and surprises you, and I can tell your wrists hurt,"" she said. She grabbed the box and slid it into the backseat. ""You still favor that left leg, and you still ache when it rains. Despite all that vamp blood. ""  
  
  ""The jumpiness'll get better. As time passes, it won't be so fresh and at the front of my mind,"" I told Amelia. (If telepathy had taught me anything, it was that people could bury the most serious and painful of memories, if you gave them enough time and distraction. ) ""The blood is not just any vampire's. It's Eric's blood. It's strong stuff. And my wrists are a lot better. "" I didn't mention that the nerves were jumping around in them like hot snakes just at this moment, a result of their having been tied together tightly for several hours. Dr. Ludwig, physician to the supernatural, had told me the nerves - and the wrists - would be back to normal, eventually.  
  
  ""Yeah, speaking of the blood . . . "" Amelia took a deep breath and steeled herself to say something she knew I wouldn't like. Since I heard it before she actually voiced it, I was able to brace myself. ""Had you thought about . . . Sookie, you didn't ask me, but I think you better not have any more of Eric's blood. I mean, I know he's your man, but you got to think about the consequences. Sometimes people get flipped by accident. It's not like it's a math equation. ""  
  
  Though I appreciated Amelia's concern, she'd trespassed into private territory. ""We don't swap,"" I said. Much. ""He just has a sip from me at, you know . . . the happy moment. "" These days Eric was having a lot more happy moments than I was, sadly. I kept hoping the bedroom magic would return; if any male could perform sexual healing, that male would be Eric.  
  
  Amelia smiled, which was what I'd been aiming for. ""At least . . . "" She turned away without finishing the sentence, but she was thinking, At least you feel like having sex.  
  
  I didn't so much feel like having sex as I felt like I ought to keep trying to enjoy it, but I definitely didn't want to discuss that. My ability to cast aside control, which is the key to good sex, had been pinched out of existence during the torture. I'd been absolutely helpless. I could only hope that I'd recover in that area, too. I knew Eric could feel my lack of completion. He'd asked me several times if I was sure I wanted to engage in sex. Nearly every time, I said yes, operating on the bicycle theory. Yes, I'd fallen off. But I was always willing to try to ride it again.  
  
  ""So, how's the relationship doing?"" she said. ""Aside from the whoopee. "" Every last thing was in Amelia's car. She was stalling, dreading the moment when she actually got into her car and drove away.  
  
  It was only pride that was keeping me from bawling all over her.  
  
  ""I think we're getting along pretty well,"" I said with a great effort at sounding cheerful. ""I'm still not sure what I feel as opposed to what the bond is making me feel. "" It was kind of nice to be able to talk about my supernatural connection to Eric, as well as my regular old man-woman attraction. Even before my injuries during the Fae War, Eric and I had established what the vampires called a blood bond, since we'd exchanged blood several times. I could sense Eric's general location and his mood, and he could feel the same things about me. He was always faintly present in the back of my mind - sort of like turning on a fan or an air filter to provide a little buzz of noise that would help you get to sleep. (It was good for me that Eric slept all day, because I could be by myself at least part of the time. Maybe he felt the same way after I went to bed at night?) It wasn't like I heard voices in my head or anything - at least no more than usual. But if I felt happy, I had to check to make sure it was me and not Eric who felt happy. Likewise for anger; Eric was big on anger, controlled and carefully banked anger, especially lately. Maybe he was getting that from me. I was pretty full of anger myself these days.  
  
  I'd forgotten all about Amelia. I'd stepped right into my own trough of depression.  
  
  She snapped me out of it. ""That's just a big fat excuse,"" she said tartly. ""Come on, Sookie. You love him, or you don't. Don't keep putting off thinking about it by blaming everything on your bond. Wah, wah, wah. If you hate the bond so much, why haven't you explored how you can get free of it?"" She took in the expression on my face, and the irritation faded out of her own. ""Do you want me to ask Octavia?"" she asked in a mil  
der voice. ""If anyone would know, she would. ""  
  
  ""Yes, I'd like to find out,"" I said, after a moment. I took a deep breath. ""You're right, I guess. I've been so depressed I've put off making any decisions, or acting on the ones I've already made. Eric's one of a kind. But I find him . . . a little overwhelming. "" He was a strong personality, and he was used to being the big fish in the pond. He also knew he had infinite time ahead of him.  
  
  I did not.  
  
  He hadn't brought that up yet, but sooner or later, he would.  
  
  ""Overwhelming or not, I love him,"" I continued. I'd never said it out loud. ""And I guess that's the bottom line. ""  
  
  ""I guess it is. "" Amelia tried to smile at me, but it was a woeful attempt. ""Listen, you keep that up, the self-knowledge thing. "" She stood for a moment, her expression frozen into the half smile. ""Well, Sook, I better get on the road. My dad's expecting me. He'll be all up in my business the minute I get back to New Orleans. ""  
  
  Amelia's dad was rich, powerful, and had no belief in Amelia's power at all. He was very wrong not to respect her witchcraft. Amelia had been born with the potential for the power in her, as every true witch is. Once Amelia had some more training and discipline, she was going to be really scary - scary on purpose, rather than because of the drastic nature of her mistakes. I hoped her mentor, Octavia, had a program in place to develop and train Amelia's talent.  
  
  After I waved Amelia down the driveway, the broad smile dropped from my face. I sat on the porch steps and cried. It didn't take much for me to be in tears these days, and my friend's departure was just the trigger now. There was so much to weep about.  
  
  My sister-in-law, Crystal, had been murdered. My brother's friend Mel had been executed. Tray and Claudine and Clancy the vampire had been killed in the line of duty. Since both Crystal and Claudine had been pregnant, that added two more deaths to the list.  
  
  Probably that should have made me long for peace above all else. But instead of turning into the Bon Temps Gandhi, in my heart I held the knowledge that there were plenty of people I wanted dead. I wasn't directly responsible for most of the deaths that were scattered in my wake, but I was haunted by the feeling that none of them would have happened if it weren't for me. In my darkest moments - and this was one of them - I wondered if my life was worth the price that had been paid for it.  
  
  MARCH  
  
  THE END OF THE FIRST WEEK  
  
  My cousin Claude was sitting on the front porch when I got up on a cloudy, brisk morning a few days after Amelia's departure. Claude wasn't as skilled at masking his presence as my great-grandfather Niall was. Because Claude was fae, I couldn't read his mind - but I could tell his mind was there, if that isn't too obscure a way to put it. I carried my coffee out to the porch, though the air was nippy, because drinking that first cup on the porch had been one of my favorite things to do before I . . . before the Fae War.  
  
  I hadn't seen my cousin in weeks. I hadn't seen him during the Fae War, and he hadn't contacted me since the death of Claudine.  
  
  I'd brought an extra mug for Claude, and I handed it to him. He accepted it silently. I'd considered the possibility he might throw it in my face. His unexpected presence had knocked me off course. I had no idea what to expect. The breeze lifted his long black hair, tossed it around like rippling ebony ribbons. His caramel eyes were red-rimmed.  
  
  ""How did she die?"" he said.  
  
  I sat on the top step. ""I didn't see it,"" I said, hunching over my knees. ""We were in that old building Dr. Ludwig was using as a hospital. I think Claudine was trying to stop the other fairies from coming down the corridor to get into the room where I was holed up with Bill and Eric and Tray. "" I looked over at Claude to make sure he knew the place, and he nodded. ""I'm pretty sure that it was Breandan who killed her, because one of her knitting needles was stuck in his shoulder when he busted into our room. ""  
  
  Breandan, my great-grandfather's enemy, had also been a prince of the fae. Breandan had believed that humans and the fae should not consort. He'd believed that to the point of fanaticism. He'd wanted the fae to completely abstain from their forays into the human world, despite the fae's large financial stake in mundane commerce and the products it had produced . . . products that helped them blend into the modern world. Breandan had especially hated the occasional taking of human lovers, a fae indulgence, and he'd hated the children born as a result of such liaisons. He'd wanted the fae separate, walled away into their own world, consorting only with their own kind.  
  
  Oddly enough, that's what my great-grandfather had decided to do after defeating the fairy who believed in this apartheid policy. After all the bloodshed, Niall concluded that peace among the fae and safety for humans could be reached only if the fae blocked themselves into their world. Breandan had achieved his ends by his own death. In my worst moments, I thought that Niall's final decision had made the whole war unnecessary.  
  
  ""She was defending you,"" Claude said, pulling me back into the moment. There was nothing in his voice. Not blame, not anger, not a question.  
  
  ""Yeah. "" That had been part of her job, defending me, by Niall's orders.  
  
  I took a long sip of coffee. Claude's sat untouched on the arm of the porch swing. Maybe Claude was wondering if he should kill me. Claudine had been his last surviving sibling.  
  
  ""You knew about the pregnancy,"" he said finally.  
  
  ""She told me right before she was killed. "" I put down my mug and wrapped my arms around my knees. I waited for the blow to fall. At first I didn't mind all that much, which was even more horrible.  
  
  Claude said, ""I understand Neave and Lochlan had hold of you. Is that why you're limping?"" The change of subject caught me off guard.  
  
  ""Yeah,"" I said. ""They had me for a couple of hours. Niall and Bill Compton killed them. Just so you know - it was Bill who killed Breandan, with my grandmother's iron trowel. "" Though the trowel had been in my family's toolshed for decades, I associated it with Gran.  
  
  Claude sat, beautiful and unreadable, for a long time. He never looked at me directly nor drank his coffee. When he'd reached some inner conclusion, he rose and left, walking down the driveway toward Hummingbird Road. I don't know where his car was parked. For all I knew, he'd walked all the way from Monroe, or flown over on a magic carpet. I went into the house, sank to my knees right inside the door, and cried. My hands were shaking. My wrists ached.  
  
  The whole time we'd been talking, I'd been waiting for him to make his move.  
  
  I realized I wanted to live.  
  
  MARCH  
  
  THE SECOND WEEK  
  
  JB said, ""Raise your arm all the way up, Sookie!"" His handsome face was creased with concentration. Holding the five-pound weight, I slowly lifted my left arm. Geez Louise, it hurt. Same with the right.  
  
  ""Okay, now the legs,"" JB said, when my arms were shaking with strain. JB wasn't a licensed physical therapist, but he was a personal trainer, so he'd had practical experience helping people get over various injuries. Maybe he'd never faced an assortment like mine, since I'd been bitten, cut, and tortured. But I hadn't had to explain the details to JB, and he wouldn't notice that my injuries were far from typical of those incurred in a car accident. I didn't want any speculation going around Bon Temps about my physical problems - so I made the occasional visits to Dr. Amy Ludwig, who looked suspiciously like a hobbit, and I enlisted the help of JB du Rone, who was a good trainer but dumb as a box of rocks.  
  
  JB's wife, my friend Tara, was sitting on one of the weight benches. She was reading What to Expect When You're Expecting. Tara, almost five months pregnant, was determined to be the best mother she could possibly be. Since JB was willing but not bright, Tara was assuming the role of Most Responsible Parent. She'd earned her high school spending money as a babysitter, which gave her some experience in child care. She was frowning as she turned the pages, a look familiar to me from our school years.  
  
  ""Have you picked a doctor yet?"" I said, after I'd finished my  
leg lifts. My quads were screaming, particularly the damaged one in my left leg. We were in the gym where JB worked, and it was after hours, because I wasn't a member. JB's boss had okayed the temporary arrangement to keep JB happy. JB was a huge asset to the gym; since he'd started working, new female clients had increased by a noticeable percentage.  
  
  ""I think so,"" said Tara. ""There were four choices in this area, and we interviewed all of them. I've had my first appointment with Dr. Dinwiddie, here in Clarice. I know it's a little hospital, but I'm not high risk, and it's so close. ""  
  
  Clarice was just a few miles from Bon Temps, where we all lived. You could get from my house to the gym in less than twenty minutes.  
  
  ""I hear good things about him,"" I said, the pain in my quads making stuff start to slide around inside my head. My forehead broke out in a clammy sweat. I was used to thinking of myself as a fit woman, and mostly I'd been a happy one. There were days now when it was all I could do to get out of bed and get in to work.  
  
  ""Sook,"" JB said, ""look at the weight on here. "" He was grinning at me.  
  
  For the first time, I registered that I'd done ten extensions with ten more pounds than I'd been using.  
  
  I smiled back at him. It didn't last long, but I knew I'd done something good.  
  
  ""Maybe you'll babysit for us sometime,"" Tara said. ""We'll teach the baby to call you Aunt Sookie. ""  
  
  I'd be a courtesy aunt. I'd get to take care of a baby. They trusted me. I found myself planning on a future.  
  
  MARCH  
  
  THE SAME WEEK  
  
  I spent the next night with Eric. As I did at least three or four times a week, I woke up panting, filled with terror, completely at sea. I held on to him as if the storm would sweep me away unless he was my anchor. I was already crying when I woke. It wasn't the first time this had happened, but this time he wept with me, bloody tears that streaked the whiteness of his face in a startling way.  
  
  ""Don't,"" I begged him. I had been trying so hard to act like my old self when I was with him. Of course, he knew differently. Tonight I could feel his resolve. Eric had something to say to me, and he was going to tell me whether I wanted to listen or not.  
  
  ""I could feel your fear and your pain that night,"" he said, in a choked voice. ""But I couldn't come to you. ""  
  
  Finally, he was telling me something I had been waiting to learn. ""Why not?"" I said, trying very hard to keep my voice level. This may seem incredible, but I had been in such shaky condition I hadn't dared to ask him.  
  
  ""Victor wouldn't let me leave,"" he said. Victor Madden was Eric's boss; he'd been appointed by Felipe de Castro, King of Nevada, to oversee the conquered kingdom of Louisiana.  
  
  My initial reaction to Eric's explanation was bitter disappointment. I'd heard this story before. A vampire more powerful than me made me do it: Bill's excuse for going back to his maker, Lorena, revisited. ""Sure,"" I said. I turned over and lay with my back to him. I felt the cold, creeping misery of disillusionment. I decided to pull my clothes on, to drive back to Bon Temps, as soon as I gathered the energy. The tension, the frustration, the rage in Eric was sapping me.  
  
  ""Victor's people chained me with silver,"" Eric said behind me. ""It burned me everywhere. ""  
  
  ""Literally. "" I tried not to sound as skeptical as I felt.  
  
  ""Yes, literally. I knew something was happening with you. Victor was at Fangtasia that night, as if he knew ahead of time he should be there. When Bill called to tell me you'd been taken, I managed to call Niall before three of Victor's people chained me to the wall. When I - protested - Victor said he couldn't allow me to take sides in the Fae War. He said that no matter what happened to you, I couldn't get involved. ""  
  
  Rage made Eric fall silent for a long moment. It poured through me like a burning, icy stream. He resumed his story in a choked voice.  
  
  ""Pam was also seized and isolated by Victor's people, though they didn't chain her. "" Pam was Eric's second-in-command. ""Since Bill was in Bon Temps, he was able to ignore Victor's phone messages. Niall met Bill at your house to track you. Bill had heard of Lochlan and Neave. We all had. We knew time would run out for you. "" I still had my back to Eric, but I was listening to more than his voice. Grief, anger, desperation.  
  
  ""How did you get out of the chains?"" I asked the dark.  
  
  ""I reminded Victor that Felipe had promised you protection, promised it to you personally. Victor pretended not to believe me. "" I could feel the bed move as Eric threw himself back against the pillows. ""Some of the vampires were strong and honorable enough to remember they were pledged to Felipe, not Victor. Though they wouldn't defy Victor to his face, behind his back they let Pam call our new king. When she had Felipe on the line, she explained to him that you and I had married. Then she demanded Victor take the telephone and talk to Felipe. Victor didn't dare to refuse. Felipe ordered Victor to let me go. "" A few months ago, Felipe de Castro had become the king of Nevada, Louisiana, and Arkansas. He was powerful, old, and very crafty. And he owed me big-time.  
  
  ""Did Felipe punish Victor?"" Hope springs eternal.  
  
  ""There's the rub,"" Eric said. Somewhere along the line, my Viking honey had read Shakespeare. ""Victor claimed he'd temporarily forgotten our marriage. "" Even if I sometimes tried to forget it myself, that made me angry. Victor had been sitting right there in Eric's office when I'd handed the ceremonial knife to Eric - in complete ignorance that my action constituted a marriage, vampire-style. I might have been ignorant, but Victor certainly wasn't. ""Victor told our king that I was lying in an attempt to save my human lover from the fae. He said vampire lives must not be lost in the rescue of a human. He told Felipe that he hadn't believed Pam and me when we'd told him Felipe had promised you protection after you saved him from Sigebert. ""  
  
  I rolled over to face Eric, and the bit of moonlight coming in the window painted him in shades of dark and silver. In my brief experience of the powerful vampire who'd maneuvered himself into a position of great power, Felipe was absolutely no fool. ""Incredible. Why didn't Felipe kill Victor?"" I asked.  
  
  ""I've given that a lot of thought, of course. I think Felipe has to pretend he believes Victor. I think Felipe realizes that in making Victor his lieutenant in charge of the whole state of Louisiana, he has inflated Victor's ambitions to the point of indecency. ""  
  
  It was possible to look at Eric objectively, I discovered, while I was thinking over what he'd said. My trust had gotten me burned in the past, and I wasn't going to get too close to the fire this time without careful consideration. It was one thing to enjoy laughing with Eric or to look forward to the times when we twined together in the dark. It was another thing to trust him with more fragile emotions. I was really not into trust right now.  
  
  ""You were upset when you came to the hospital,"" I said indirectly. When I'd wakened in the old factory Dr. Ludwig was using as a field hospital, my injuries had been so painful I'd thought dying might prove easier than living. Bill, who had saved me, had been poisoned with a bite from Neave's silver teeth. His survival had been up in the air. The mortally wounded Tray Dawson, Amelia's werewolf lover, had hung on long enough to die by the sword when Breandan's forces stormed the hospital.  
  
  ""While you were with Neave and Lochlan, I suffered with you,"" he said, meeting my eyes directly. ""I hurt with you. I bled with you - not only because we're bonded, but because of the love I have for you. ""  
  
  I raised a skeptical eyebrow. I couldn't help it, though I could feel that he meant what he was saying. I was just willing to believe that Eric would have come to my help much faster, if he could have. I was willing to believe that he'd heard the echo of the horror of my time with the fae torturers.  
  
  But my pain and blood and terror had been my own. He might have felt them, but from a separate place. ""I believe you would have been there if you could have,"" I said, knowing my voice was too calm. ""I really do believe that. I know you would have killed them. "" Eric leaned over on one elbow, and his  
big hand pressed my face to his chest.  
  
  I couldn't deny that I felt better since he'd brought himself to tell me. Yet I didn't feel as much better as I'd hoped, though now I knew why he hadn't come when I'd been screaming for him. I could even understand why it had taken so long for him to tell me. Helplessness was a state Eric didn't often encounter. Eric was supernatural, and he was incredibly strong, and he was a great fighter. But he was not a superhero, and he couldn't overcome several determined members of his own race. And I realized he'd given me a lot of blood when he himself was healing from the silver chains.  
  
  Finally, something inside me relaxed at the logic of his story. I believed him in my heart, not just in my head.  
  
  A red tear fell on my bare shoulder and coursed down. I swept it up on my finger, putting my finger to his lips - offering his pain back to him. I had plenty of my own.  
  
  ""I think we need to kill Victor,"" I said, and his eyes met mine.  
  
  I'd finally succeeded in surprising Eric.  
  
  MARCH  
  
  THE THIRD WEEK  
  
  ""So,"" my brother said. ""As you can tell, me and Michele are still seeing each other. "" He was standing with his back to me, turning the steaks on the grill. I was sitting in a folding chair, looking out over the large pond and its dock. It was a beautiful evening, cool and brisk. I was actually content to sit there and watch him work; I was enjoying being with Jason. Michele was in the house making a salad. I could hear her singing Travis Tritt.  
  
  ""I'm glad,"" I said, and I was sincere. It was the first time I'd been in a private setting with my brother in months. Jason had been through his own bad time. His estranged wife and their unborn child had died horribly. He'd discovered his best male friend had been in love with him, sick in love. But as I watched him grilling, listened to his girlfriend singing inside the house, I understood that Jason was a great survivor. Here my brother was, dating again, pleased at the prospect of eating steak and the mashed potato casserole I'd brought and the salad Michele was making. I had to admire Jason's determination to find pleasure in his life. My brother was not a very good role model in a lot of ways, but I could hardly point fingers.  
  
  ""Michele is a good woman,"" I said out loud.  
  
  She was, too - though maybe not in the way our gran would have used the term. Michele Schubert was absolutely out-front about everything. You couldn't shame her, because she wouldn't do something she wouldn't own up to. Operating on the same principle of full disclosure, if Michele had a grievance with you, you knew about it. She worked in the Ford dealership's repair shop as a scheduler and clerk. It was a tribute to her efficiency that she still worked for her former father-in-law. (In fact, he'd been known to say he liked her a tad better than he liked his son, some days. )  
  
  Michele came out on the deck. She was wearing the jeans and Ford-logo polo shirt she wore to work, and her dark hair was twisted in a knot on her head. Michele liked heavy eye makeup, big purses, and high heels. She was barefoot now. ""Hey, Sookie, you like ranch dressing?"" she asked. ""Or we got some honey mustard. ""  
  
  ""Ranch will be fine,"" I said. ""You need any help?""  
  
  ""Nope, I'm good. "" Michele's cell phone went off. ""Dammit, it's Pop Schubert again. That man can't find his ass with both hands. ""  
  
  She went back in the house, the phone to her ear.  
  
  ""I worry, though, about putting her in danger,"" Jason said in the diffident voice he used when he was asking my opinion about something supernatural. ""I mean . . . that fairy, Dermot, the one that looks like me. Do you know if he's still around?""  
  
  He'd turned to face me. He was leaning against the railing of the deck he'd added to the house my mom and dad had built when they were expecting Jason. Mom and Dad hadn't gotten to enjoy it for much more than a decade. They'd died when I was seven, and when Jason had gotten old enough to live on his own (in his estimation), he'd moved out of Gran's and into this house. It had seen many a wild party for two or three years, but he'd become steadier. Tonight it was very clear to me that his recent losses had sobered him further.  
  
  I took a swallow from my bottle. I wasn't much of a drinker - I saw too much overindulgence at work - but it had been impossible to turn down a cold beer on this bright evening. ""I wish I knew where Dermot was, too,"" I said. Dermot was the fraternal twin of our half-fairy grandfather Fintan. ""Niall sealed himself into Faery with all the other fairies who wanted to join him, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Dermot's in Faery with him. Claude stayed here. I saw him a couple of weeks ago. "" Niall was our great-grandfather. Claude was his grandson from Niall's marriage to another full fae.  
  
  ""Claude, the male stripper. ""  
  
  ""The owner of a strip club, who strips himself on ladies' night,"" I corrected. ""Our cousin models for romance covers, too. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, I bet the girls faint when he walks by. Michele's got a book with him on the cover in some genie costume. He must love every minute of it. "" Jason definitely sounded envious.  
  
  ""I bet he does. You know, he's a pain in the butt,"" I said, and laughed, surprising myself.  
  
  ""You see him much?""  
  
  ""Just the once, since I got hurt. But when I picked up the mail yesterday, he'd sent me some free coupons for ladies' night at Hooligans. ""  
  
  ""You think you'll ever take him up on it?""  
  
  ""Not yet. Maybe when I'm . . . in a better mood. ""  
  
  ""You think Eric would mind you seeing another guy naked?"" Jason was trying to show me how much he'd changed by his casual reference to my relationship with a vampire. Well, give my brother points for ""willing. ""  
  
  ""I'm not sure,"" I said. ""But I wouldn't watch other guys take off their clothes without letting Eric know about it ahead of time. Give him a chance to put in his two cents. Would you tell Michele you were going to a club to watch women strip?""  
  
  Jason laughed. ""I'd at least mention it, just to hear what she'd say. "" He put the steaks on a platter and gestured to the sliding glass doors. ""We're ready,"" he said, and I pulled the door open for him. I'd set the table earlier, and now I poured the tea. Michele had put the salad and the hot potato casserole on the table, and she got some A-1 steak sauce from the pantry. Jason loved his A-1. With the big barbecuing fork, Jason put one steak on each plate. In a couple of minutes, we were all eating. It was kind of homey, the three of us.  
  
  ""Calvin came into the dealership today,"" Michele said. ""He's thinking of trading in his old pickup. "" Calvin Norris was a good man with a good job. He was in his forties, and he carried a lot of responsibility on his shoulders. He was my brother's leader, the dominant male in the werepanther community centered in the little settlement of Hotshot.  
  
  ""He still dating Tanya?"" I asked. Tanya Grissom worked at Norcross, same as Calvin, but she sometimes filled in at Merlotte's when one of the other waitresses couldn't work.  
  
  ""Yeah, she's living with him,"" Jason said. ""They fight pretty often, but I think she's staying. ""  
  
  Calvin Norris, leader of the werepanthers, did his best not to get involved in vampire affairs. He'd had a lot on his plate since the Weres had come out. He'd declared that he was two-natured the next day in the break room at work. Now that the word had gotten around, it had only earned Calvin more respect. He had a good reputation in the Bon Temps area, even if most of the people who lived out in Hotshot were regarded with some suspicion since the community was so isolated and peculiar.  
  
  ""How come you didn't come out when Calvin did?"" I asked. That was a thought I'd never heard in Jason's head.  
  
  My brother looked thoughtful, an expression that sat a little oddly on him. ""I guess I just ain't ready to answer a lot of questions,"" he said. ""It's a personal thing, the change. Michele knows, and that's all that's important. ""  
  
  Michele smiled at him. ""I'm real proud of Jason,"" she said, and that was enough. ""He manned up when he turned panther. Wasn't like he could help it. He's making the best of it. No whining. He'll tell people about it when he'  
s ready. ""  
  
  Jason and Michele were just startling me all over the place. ""I haven't ever said anything to anyone,"" I assured him.  
  
  ""I never thought you would. Calvin says Eric is like a chief vampire,"" Jason said, hopping into a different topic.  
  
  I don't talk about vampire politics at any length with nonvamps. Just not a good idea. But Jason and Michele had shared with me, and I wanted to share a little back. ""Eric's got some power. But he's got a new boss, and things are touchy. ""  
  
  ""You want to talk about that?"" I could tell Jason was uncertain about hearing whatever I chose to tell them, but he was trying hard to be a good brother.  
  
  ""I better not,"" I said, and saw his relief. Even Michele was glad to turn back to her steak. ""But apart from dealing with other vampires, Eric and I are doing okay. There's always some give and take in relationships, right?"" Though Jason had had scores of relationships over the years, he'd learned about give and take only recently.  
  
  ""I been talking to Hoyt again,"" Jason said, and I understood the pertinence. Hoyt, Jason's shadow for years, had dropped off my brother's radar for a while. Hoyt's fianc¨¦e, Holly, who worked at Merlotte's with me, wasn't a big Jason fan. I was surprised Jason had his best buddy back, and I was even more surprised Holly had consented to this renewal.  
  
  ""I've changed a lot, Sookie,"" my brother said, as if (for once) he'd been reading my mind. ""I want to be a good friend to Hoyt. I want to be a good boyfriend to Michele. "" He looked at Michele seriously, putting his hand over hers. ""And I want to be a better brother. We're all we got left. Except for the fairy relations, and I'd just as soon forget about them. "" He looked down at his plate, embarrassed. ""I can't hardly believe that Gran cheated on Grandpa. ""  
  
  ""I had an idea about that,"" I said. I'd been struggling with the same disbelief. ""Gran really wanted children, and that wasn't going to happen for her and Grandpa. I was thinking maybe she was enchanted by Fintan. Fairies can mess with your mind, like the vamps can. And you know how beautiful they are. ""  
  
  ""Claudine sure was. And I guess if you're a woman, Claude looks pretty good. ""  
  
  ""Claudine really toned it down since she was passing for human. "" Claudine, Claude's triplet, had been a stunning six-foot-tall beauty.  
  
  Jason said, ""Grandpa wasn't any picture in the looks department. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, I know. "" We looked at each other, silently acknowledging the power of physical attraction. Then we said, simultaneously, ""But Gran?"" And we couldn't help but laugh. Michele tried hard to keep a straight face, but finally she couldn't help grinning at us. It was hard enough thinking about your parents having sex, but your grandparents? Totally wrong.  
  
  ""Now that I'm thinking about Gran, I've been meaning to ask you if I could have that table she put up in the attic,"" Jason said. ""The pie-crust table that used to sit by the armchair in the living room?""  
  
  ""Sure, swing by and pick it up sometime,"" I said. ""It's probably sitting right where you put it the day she asked you to take it up to the attic. ""  
  
  I left soon after with my almost-empty casserole dish, some leftover steak, and a cheerful heart.  
  
  I certainly hadn't thought having dinner with my brother and his girlfriend was any big deal, but when I got home that night I slept all the way through until morning, for the first time in weeks.  
  
  MARCH  
  
  THE FOURTH WEEK  
  
  ""There,"" said Sam. I had to strain to hear him. Someone had put Jace Everett's ""Bad Things"" on, and just about everyone in the bar was singing along. ""You've smiled three times tonight. ""  
  
  ""You counting my facial expressions?"" I put down my tray and gave him a look. Sam, my boss and friend, is a true shapeshifter; he can change into anything warm-blooded, I guess. I haven't asked him about lizards and snakes and bugs.  
  
  ""Well, it's good to see that smile again,"" he said. He rearranged some bottles on the shelf, just to look busy. ""I missed it. ""  
  
  ""It's good to feel like smiling,"" I told him. ""I like the haircut, by the way. ""  
  
  Sam ran a self-conscious hand across his head. His hair was short, and it hugged his scalp like a red gold cap. ""Summer's coming up. I thought it might feel good. ""  
  
  ""Probably will. ""  
  
  ""You already started sunbathing?"" My tan was famous.  
  
  ""Oh, yeah. "" In fact, I'd started extra early this spring. The first day I'd put on my swimsuit, all hell had broken loose. I'd killed a fairy. But that was past. I'd lain out yesterday, and not a thing had happened. Though I confess I hadn't taken the radio outside, because I'd wanted to be sure I could hear if something was sneaking up on me. But nothing had. In fact, I'd had a remarkably peaceful hour lying in the sun, watching a butterfly waft by every now and then. One of my great-great-grandmother's rosebushes was blooming, and the scent had healed something inside me. ""The sun just makes me feel real good,"" I said. I suddenly remembered that the fae had told me that I came from sky fairies, instead of water fairies. I didn't know anything about that, but I wondered if my love of the sun was a genetic thing.....

We met at a badminton club that I go to weekly. We're not always in the same classes due to work and the times they run the classes.

We originally met up twice for coffee (but he labelled this as a 'hang out' rather than a 'date'). I remained hopeful and hinted I'd like a 'real date' (do whatever as long as it was labelled a date). This ended up being a meal at his house and we ended up sleeping together for the first time (I wanted to too).

From there every 'hang out' was the same set up - food at his house and basically Netflix and chill.

Obviously, I gave up hope and know I'm parked in the 'casual hook up girl' vibe, fine. I've come to terms with that and I'm moving on. I've addressed this to him on text saying it's okay that you don't want more and have been pulling back my energy.

However, he continues to text me all day long, texting first, asking questions about my day, etc. Surface level chat.

My question is - I'm happy to text him that's no skin off my back. But I won't be sleeping with him again unless I get a real date planned and he does it right. That's obviously not going to happen. But I want to handle this in a way which says 'I know my value, I don't blame you for not wanting more, and I want everything to be nice, easy and chill because I know I might have to see you on a weekly basis'.

I don't hold a grudge against him for potentially using me for sex. I don't have the time or energy to be caught up in that drama. I'm happy to just accept, move on. But I feel like he is keeping me sweet as a backup. I'm not going to be his backup but I'm also not the type to ghost because that's immature.

Both late 20s/early30s ish

Edit: We've never been on a 'real' date or labelled as a date. Every meet up was a 'hang out' or made out to be more but was later confirmed a hang out. He also knows I like him and he has also rejected me when I asked him out instead. ",2,1751270929.0,AskMenAdvice,4,0.75,False
1lo1xxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lo1xxi/panick_attacks_about_the_health_of_my_cat/,Panick attacks about the health of my cat,"Hi,

I have had panic disorder for over 20 years now. I don't take any medication for it, besides the occassional benzo. With occasional I mean max 10 times a year. So really not a lot. The last few years I have been coping fairly well with it. Attacks were not many and only in very specific cirsomstances. So overall it has been going okay.

However leaving on vacation and leaving my pets behind has always been hard for me. This year it seems to be complety out of control. One of my cats has very audible breathing. She is not overweight, only 2 years old and otherwise in perfect health. The audible breathing has been present for 1.5 years now.

I went to the vet several times 1.5 years ago and even to a specialist. All said it was audbile but not anything that warrants further examination.  Because of sudden increased anxiety about it I went again last week. He also said, it's nothing to be worried about. I even told him about my anxiety and he tried his best to reassure me. But for some reason it just doesn't help me.

  
I try to relax about it. I try to ignore it. But every few hours I hear it again and it triggers major panick attacks. 

I haven't had them this severe in years. My vacations (14 days abroad) is at the end of August and I'm already in this state now. 

I have made an appointment with my doctor for some talks. I have stopped drinking coffee and am trying to take extra care of myself. But nothing seems to be really working.

  
My mind keeps going to ""the cat is very sick and during your vacation nobody will notice she is suffering and she will die'.  Complety irrational. The cat is behaving normally. Eating, playing etc. etc.

  
My husband had a hard time dealing with this. He keeps saying I should do sports so I will feel better.

  
How do you cope with these intrusive and repetitve thoughts about impending doom? How do you 'let go'. ?

Recently, my parents gave me a Delonghi Icona Vintage machine, so I started trying to make espresso at home using moka-style pre-ground coffee.

Long story short… it tastes awful. Way too watery, and it comes out way too fast.

I tried using pre-ground espresso coffee as well, but the result was still pretty bad — same story: weak, fast, watery. So, I began doing some research to understand how to get better espresso with these entry-level machines.

I’ve watched a bunch of YouTube videos about brew ratios, pressurized vs. unpressurized baskets, tamping, WDT, and so on. My budget is limited, but here’s what I plan to buy:

* A grinder (went with the Kingrinder K6)
* An unpressurized filter (A compatible bottomless portafilter from Amazon — basket included)
* A tamper (cheap stainless steel one from Amazon)
* A homemade WDT tool

My question is:  
If I take the time to dial in the grind size, tamping, and puck prep properly, will I see a noticeable improvement in my espresso? Or is the Delonghi Icona Vintage just too limited to get decent results?

I’ve seen a lot of videos of people getting surprisingly good results with the Delonghi Dedica, which is similar in specs. So now I’m wondering: is it actually possible to get café-quality espresso with this setup, or am I chasing something that this machine just can't deliver?",1,1751270743.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best Doxie backpacks are not simply repurposed pet carriers; they are thoughtfully engineered to provide optimal support and comfort for a dachshund's distinctive build. From adjustable straps to strategically placed ventilation, these backpacks aim to make travel enjoyable and safe for your beloved wiener dog.**Ergonomic Design**

A well-designed Doxie backpack takes into account the dachshund's elongated body. It should feature a supportive base that prevents sagging, which can strain the dog's back. The internal structure should distribute weight evenly to avoid pressure points. The pack's overall shape needs to facilitate a natural standing or lying position for the dog,with enough room to avoid feeling cramped.**Adjustable Straps and Padding**

comfort for the owner is just as important as comfort for the dog. Adjustable shoulder straps, chest straps, and waist belts allow for a customized fit that distributes the weight appropriately. Padded straps and back panels prevent chafing and discomfort during longer treks.The adjustability ensures the backpack sits securely and doesn't shift excessively, which could unbalance the wearer.

**Ventilation and Visibility**

proper airflow is critical to prevent overheating, especially in warmer weather. Mesh panels strategically placed throughout the backpack allow for ample ventilation.Some models incorporate larger viewing windows, which minimize anxiety for dogs who prefer to see their surroundings, and maximize airflow concurrently.

**Safety features and Durability**

Secure zippers or clasps are essential to prevent accidental escapes. Internal leashes or tethers attach to the dog's harness to keep them contained within the backpack. Reflective strips enhance visibility in low-light conditions, ensuring safety during evening walks. Durable materials like reinforced nylon or canvas withstand wear and tear,ensuring the backpack lasts.

**Easy Cleaning and Storage**

Accidents happen.Backpacks constructed from water-resistant and easy-to-clean materials simplify cleanup after mishaps. Removable, washable padding adds to hygiene. When not in use, the backpack should fold down or collapse for convenient storage.

**Size and Weight Capacity**

Dachshunds vary in size, so choosing the correct size backpack is extremely important. Measure your dog's length (neck to base of tail) and weight to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. Check the manufacturer's weight recommendations too before purchasing.Key features of the best Doxie Backpacks include:

*   Ergonomic Design for Dachshunds.
*   Adjustable and Padded Straps.
*   Ventilation with good visibility.
*   Safety features that include an internal leash.

## Core Benefits

A Doxie backpack offers more than just a convenient way to transport your dog — it unlocks a new level of shared experiences and strengthens the bond between owner and pet. from exploring new trails to navigating crowded city streets, these backpacks provide benefits for both dog and owner and are designed explicitly with dachshunds at the forefront of design.

**Increased Mobility and Exploration**

Dachshunds, with their short legs, are not always suited for long walks or challenging terrain. A backpack allows them to participate in activities that would otherwise be impossible. Explore hiking trails, navigate crowded public spaces, or simply enjoy a longer walk, all while keeping your doxie safe and comfortable.

**Enhanced Safety and Security**

Backpacks provide a secure and contained habitat, minimizing the risk of your Doxie running off or getting into trouble. This is particularly important in areas with traffic, other animals, or potential hazards.The backpack shields your dog from being stepped on in crowded areas, keeping them safe from accidental injuries.**Reduced Strain on the Dog's Back**

Walking long distances or over rough terrain can put strain on a dachshund's back, predisposing them to intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Carrying them in a well-designed backpack minimizes this risk, providing support and reducing the impact on their spine. This is especially beneficial for older Doxies or those with pre-existing back problems.**strengthened Bond and Companionship**

A Doxie backpack allows you to include your dog in more aspects of your life, strengthening the bond between you. Sharing new experiences together, whether it's a visit to a coffee shop or a hike in the woods, creates lasting memories and deepens your connection. Your dog will appreciate being close to you and feeling like an integral part of your adventures.

**Convenience and Versatility**

A Doxie backpack is not just for hiking; it's a versatile tool for everyday life. Use it for trips to the vet, visits to friends, or outings to dog-kind stores.The backpack frees up your hands, making it easier to manage other tasks while keeping your dog close by.

## FAQs Section

Doxie backpacks are increasingly popular, but potential buyers often have questions about their suitability and usage. These frequently asked questions can help you make an informed decision.

**Is a Doxie backpack safe for my dog's back?**

Yes, when used correctly, a Doxie backpack can be safe and even beneficial for your dog's back. Look for backpacks with a rigid or supportive base that prevents sagging and distributes weight evenly. Avoid backpacks that allow the dog to slump or contort their body. As always, consult your veterinarian if you have specific concerns about your dog's health.

**How do I get my Doxie used to a backpack?**

Introduce the backpack gradually. Start by placing the backpack on the floor and allowing your dog to sniff and explore it. Reward them for approaching the backpack calmly. Next, try placing your dog inside the backpack for short periods, gradually increasing the time as they become more comfortable. Use treats and positive reinforcement throughout the process.

**What size Doxie backpack should I buy?**

Measure your dog's length (neck to base of tail) and weight. Compare these measurements to the manufacturer's sizing chart. Choose a backpack that provides ample space for your dog to stand, sit, and lie down comfortably. Ensure the backpack's weight capacity is sufficient for your dog.

**Can I use a Doxie backpack on airplanes?**

Some airlines allow small dogs in carriers to travel in the cabin. Check with the airline for their specific size and weight restrictions for pet carriers. Choose a Doxie backpack that meets these requirements and is approved for airline travel. Make sure your dog is comfortable and secure in the backpack before the flight.

Chapter 1



I caught my husband cheating – right in my best friend's bed.



There was my husband Milo Harrison, who couldn’t get it up for three years, desperately pounding my best friend Gina Reed.



I whipped out my phone and snapped their fucking from every conceivable angle.



Then I packaged the whole collection and sent to Gina's husband.



Along with a sweet message: \[Congratulations, Oliver! Your wife's a genius healer! She juet cure my husband's impotence!\]



""Well, honey, how's your impotence sure cleared up this fast?""



I leaned against the doorframe with a sickeningly sweet tone.



The two naked bodies on the bed instantly froze.



My husband Milo looked at me like he'd seen a ghost, stammering without getting a single word out.



My dear friend Gina was quicker on the uptake – she grabbed the sheets and wrapped them around herself.



""Rita... we can...""



""Don't rush to explain."" I pulled out my phone.



""Let me get a picture first. This is the first time in three years of marriage I've seen my husband's dick this... perky.""



Milo threw off the covers and lunged for my phone. I nearly got blinded by his swinging penis.



""Whoa there, honey, easy does it. Why so worked up? It's not like I haven't seen it before.""



I stepped back.



""Oh wait, actually I haven't seen it like THIS – since you've been keeping your V-card for my bestie this three years. How thoughtful of you.""



Gina's cheeks flushed red: ""Rita, let me explain. This isn't what you think.""



I smiled at her: ""Explain what? You sacrificed yourself to cure my husband's ED. I should be kissing your feet in gratitude?""



""You two go on. I'll just call Oliver Harrison and have him come watch his wife's sexy performance.""



Gina's face went ghost white.



She was Milo's brother‘s wife, my sister-in-law, and my best friend.



Ah, What a fucking mess of relationships.



""You wouldn't dare!"" Milo roared.



I raised an eyebrow: ""You did it. Why the hell wouldn't I?""



Gina suddenly threw herself at my legs.



""Rita, please, don't tell Oliver. I know I screwed up.""



Looking at my childhood friend, now half-naked and clinging to my legs, I suddenly found it ridiculious.



""Gina, get up first.""



I bent down and patted her shoulder: ""The floor's cold.""



She looked up at me hopefully.



I continued: ""With that pitiful face, you’re gonna break my husband’s heart.""



Then I turned to leave, and Milo grabbed my arm.



""What are you trying to do? You want to destroy our family?""



I clenched my fists, smiling sweetly.



What a shameless thing to say.



""I need to go to the hospital for some tests to figure out why my husband is impotent with me but fucks everyone else so hard.""



Milo's face turned bright red: ""Rita Collins, cut the sarcasm!""



""Ohoh, calm down."" I held up my phone.



""Want to see the photos I just took? Great composition, angles, lighting – they'd probably go viral on tiktok.""



Gina lunged for my phone, but I dodged.



I grinned: ""Oh, should I add a caption? How about 'My Husband and Best Friend's Sweet Moments'?""



""You—!"" Gina was shaking with rage.



Just then, my phone rang. Oliver's call.



I hit speakerphone: ""Hey, Oliver.""



""I'm downstairs. What's the apartment number?""



Oliver's deep voice filled the room.



Gina's pupils contracted, her whole body visibly trembling.



Chapter 2



Footsteps echoed from the hallway.



I leisurely leaned on my chair and pulled out my phone, hitting record.



Oliver pushed through the door, his face stone-cold as he scanned the room.



His gaze swept over half-naked Gina, then locked onto his panicked brother's face.



""Bro...""



Milo's voice was shaking like crazy.



Oliver said nothing, just turned to me: ""You recording this?""



I blinked, then quickly nodded like a good student: ""Yep.""



Gina collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face.



""Honey, this isn't what you think...""



""Shut up.""



Two simple words, but Gina clammed up like someone had grabbed her by the throat.



I sat there watching this unfold, feeling weirdly detached from it all.



I'm the one who got betrayed. I should be the most devastated person here.



But instead, I sat there like a spectator, coldly watching this whole shitshow unfold.



""Both of you, get dressed. Now."" Oliver's voice was ice-cold.



Watching them scramble into their clothes, I almost wanted to laugh.



This whole scene felt like a trashy TV drama.



Once they were decent, Oliver grabbed Milo and landed two solid punches across his face.



Then came a brutal knee to the gut. I watched Milo double over, clutching himself, his lips going white.



After years of faking impotence, looks like he might actually achieve it now.



My brother-in-law always seemed so refined and gentle. Who knew he could get this savage when pissed.



After Milo hit the floor, Oliver finally spoke: ""Spill it. How long?""



No one answered.



""I asked you how fucking long!"" Oliver roared.



Even I jumped.



Gina sobbed: ""Three... three years...""



Three years.



Exactly how long Milo and I had been married.



So he'd been lying to me from day one.



All those excuses, all that bullshit about his ""condition"" – pure lies.



I spoke up, my voice dripping with sarcasm:



""So you two are true love? Started before Milo and I even got married?""



Milo kept his head down.



""Look up! Look at us when we're talking to you!"" Oliver bellowed again.



Milo slowly raised his head, eyes full of terror: ""Oliver... I...""



""Don't call my name!"" Oliver's voice was pure rage.



""You're not my brother, you're a fucking bastard.""



Milo went pale as a ghost.



Gina suddenly dropped to her knees: ""Honey, I'm sorry... I really know I screwed up...""



I added: ""You know you screwed up, or you're just scared now?""



If I hadn't caught them, who knows how long they would've kept us wearing these green hats.



I stood up and faced Oliver: ""Got everything on video. Let's go – this place is disgusting.""



Oliver nodded and turned to leave.



""Wait! Don't go!"" Milo panicked and dropped to his knees.



I turned back with the sweetest smile:



""Stay for what? Watch you and your sister-in-law go for round two?""



""Besides, you want to be with your brother's wife so badly – we're doing you a favor.""



""No! Honey, we can't get divorced!"" Gina shrieked.



Oliver was more successful than my husband, never let her want for money. Now she probably couldn't bear to give that up.



Guess compared to Milo's love, she cared more about Oliver's bank account.



""You're always working, I got so lonely and made this stupid mistake. Please forgive me just this once, I swear I'll never see him again, please?""



Gina looked absolutely heartbroken, even I felt a little sorry for this ‘poor beauty’.



But Oliver didn't even glance her way.



""No way.""



Chapter 3



""You bitch! Get your ass out here!""



Bright and early in the morning, there was screaming and wailing coming from the company lobby.



I was in my office drinking coffee when a colleague told me Gina's mom had come looking for trouble. I nearly spit out my coffee.



This plot development is so melodramatic.



""Rita Collins, you shameless homewrecker! Seducing my son-in-law and destroying my daughter's marriage – do you have any fucking shame left!""



Gina's mother had serious lung power, standing at the reception desk acting on a whole dramatic show.



My colleague Kevin rushed over: ""Rita, Gina Reed's mom is downstairs causing a scene, saying you seduced her son-in-law...""



I leisurely set down my coffee cup: ""Oh, well then I better go see this.""



When I got to the lobby, Gina's mom was wiping away tears while trashing me to anyone who'd listen.



""Everyone listen up! This woman was so jealous that my daughter married into a rich family, so she had to stick her nose in and wreck my daughter's perfect family!""



I leaned against the reception counter, grinning as I watched this comedy show.



The receptionist looked relieved when she saw me: ""Mrs. Reed, Manager Collins is here.""



Gina's mom whipped around, getting even more pissed when she saw how relaxed I looked: ""Well look who finally dares to show her face!""



""Why wouldn't I?"" I raised an eyebrow.



""Should I hide like some people do after they get caught doing nasty shit?""



Gina's mom's face turned bright red.



""Stop twisting the facts! My daughter and son-in-law were perfectly happy until you destroyed their family.""



I cut straight to the point: ""Which son-in-law are we talking about here? The older one or the younger one?""



She looked confused: ""What older and younger?""



I had a lightbulb moment: ""Oh! You don't know? Let me tell you then.""



""Your daughter Gina Reed is married to Oliver Harrison – that's your older son-in-law.""



""But she's also screwing Milo Harrison – that's your younger son-in-law.""



""So I'm genuinely curious – which son-in-law are you referring to?""



All my colleagues gasped.



Gina's mom's expression shifted: ""That's... that's complete bullshit!""



I pulled out my phone.



""Want to see the video? I recorded your daughter getting pounding by the younger son-in-law.""



She panicked: ""You... don't you dare!""



I continued: ""If you really cared about your daughter, you'd go home and tell her to stop stirring up shit.""



""The divorce papers are already filed. What's the point of coming here to make a scene?""



She got frantic: ""My daughter can't get divorced!""



I laughed: ""What is it – can't bear to give up the older son-in-law's money, or think the younger one's not good enough?""



Gina's mom was so mad she stomped her feet, but she knew she wouldn't get anywhere here and stormed off.



My colleagues all looked at me with admiration.



Kevin came over: ""Rita, that was fucking awesome!""



I smiled: ""Awesome? That's just the warm-up act.""



Back in my office, I texted Oliver:



\[Your former mother-in-law just caused a scene at my company.\]



Oliver replied quickly: \[Need me to handle it?\]



Me: \[Nah, I took care of it.\[



Oliver: \[Thanks.\]



Looking at my phone screen, I couldn't help thinking life was full of surprises.

🌼 Some slimes are completely melted, as they were in my cupboard for months. If you would like them to be reactivated, they would cost 1.50€/slime

🌼 As always, if you are uncomfortable with secondhand slimes, please don't buy or express discomfort with them! Secondhand slimes are an affordable way for other slimers to get them, especially those of us in the EU 🥲

🌼Only selling these for 2 weeks, so grab them quick! FCFS, after that, I'll be travelling back to Singapore for my wedding

I had booked 2 standard 2 queen rooms at the JW Marriott Parq Casino in Vancouver.  I used 440,000 Bonvoy points (most transferred from Amex points during a promo) to get these 2 rooms for 3 nights for my family before leaving on an Alaskan cruise.  

As we were scrambling to pack to make our flight to Vancouver, I get an email from the hotel asking if I’d be interested is swapping my 2 rooms for an upgrade to their “2 bedroom suite”.  I immediately accepted, but only saw a few photos that showed what appeared to be a really nice room, but they didn’t really tell the whole story.  It became apparent when we checked in how incredible this room was.  The desk clerk’s face changed when he was like “whoa, we got you upgraded to the sky suite! You know that room bills for $6000/nt”.  

So yea, we got room 2501 for 3 nights.  2000SF, 2 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, living room with dining table, tv room, and coffee/kitchenette room.  Probably had more to do with freeing up 2 rooms for the weekend then me getting upgraded for my lowly Gold status, but it was certainly one hell of an upgrade, and really helped make this trip memorable.",6,1751269176.0,marriott,1,1.0,False

After a flu in January and taking meds, I developed severe gut issues. Two days after stopping the meds, I had a coffee and it triggered intense bloating, gas, dizziness, and a vagal reaction so strong that I nearly passed out and ended up in the ER.

Since then, I’ve had chronic symptoms:

Bloating/gas

Lack of air/can't breath properly 

Diarrhea during crisis

Brain fog

Weight loss due to small amount of food ingested

Dizziness, visual issues

Post-meal crashes

Reactions to many foods

Worsening before my period

Hair loss

I'm doing all the tests and for now the marker that is so high is the calprotectine (there is a flamation) the rest is normal (normal, whatever).

A gastro diagnosed post-infectious dysbiosis + Hashimoto's, and I’m on a low FODMAP diet, probiotics and Rabeprazole.

A few days ago, I took a bit of royal jelly and had a major flare again. Now I suspect hydrogen-dominant SIBO and will do both glucose and lactulose breath tests.

Anyone else get SIBO after the flu or meds? Did you have vagus nerve symptoms too? I’m exhausted and would love to hear from others who’ve been through this.

Thank you.

I have a petrol blue sofa, a color choice i bitterly regret. I’ve tried to own it with mustard pillows, with limited success. The wooden floors are warm toned, it makes it difficult to style. 

I’ve bought two carpets that were a disaster; 
1. A large low pile white carpet. It was too cold and clashed with everything. It was just all white. 
2. A woven white / orange pattern carpet. It just looked off, it’s too similar to the floor but not in a good way. 


My old coffee table is a cheap IKEA one (close to the window), that we haven’t got rid of because we can’t find a replacement 😭

Please any and all suggestions regard a carpet and coffee table. Or anything else really.
I don’t live in the US and buying home furniture and decoration is extremely expensive here, not to mentioned limited selection, so really want this to be successful.  Many thanks 🙏

But after rewatching it, I would really also want the ending to actually show Peter at his lowest. Now it honestly just seemed like he had it all down: all his stuff, new apartment that he seemed to be excited about, new outfit.. Yeah the coffee shop scene is sad with him deciding that his friends are better off without him.  Dude didn't even shed  a tear at May's grave.

I would have wanted to see him head down while sitting somewhere, his hands behind his head and head bowed.The weight of everything that happened behind him. He would probably be homeless if they actually had decided to make anything realitistic about the movie.  And then maybe get up and go out as Spiderman, gazing into the city and jumping off into the it. 

Maybe they did want to make it more hopeful if it really was going to be the last Tom's Spiderman. It's not and I'm very happy about it as he is my favourite Spiderman in the movies. But maybe show more that he was actually more affected by things. It was his fault that May died. He effed up badly in the movie on so many things.

While frustrating, they often ease over time as your body adjusts.

Here is why they happen, what’s common, how to manage them, and when to get help:

---

Why Do Side Effects Happen?

These medications work by slowing digestion and reducing appetite, which can: 
✅ Alter gut motility (slowing food movement)
✅ Affect hydration and electrolyte balance
✅ Change taste perception
✅ Impact how your body senses fullness

They’re signs your body is adapting, not that you are failing.

---

Common Side Effects & Gentle Management

1️⃣ Nausea 🤢

Why: Slower digestion and changes in appetite signals.

Manage:

Eat smaller, frequent meals.

Avoid greasy, spicy, or heavy meals.

Stay upright for 30 minutes after eating.

Sip water or ginger tea slowly.

Try dry crackers before getting up.

Avoid dehydration, which worsens nausea.

---

2️⃣ Constipation 💩

Why: Slower digestion means slower bowel movement.

Manage:

Increase water intake.

Add fibre gradually (berries, chia seeds, veggies).

Move daily (gentle walks).

Warm fluids (coffee or tea) can help.

If needed, discuss gentle laxatives with your doctor.

---

3️⃣ Fatigue 😴

Why: Lower calorie intake + your body adapting to a new appetite level.

Manage:

Ensure adequate hydration.

Eat enough protein to maintain energy.

Rest when needed; your energy should stabilise.

Light movement (walking, stretching) can help boost energy.

---

4️⃣ Taste Changes 😝

Why: Medication can alter taste perception and food preferences.

Manage:

Try different seasonings and herbs.

Use cold foods if hot foods taste odd.

Try lemon, ginger, or mint to freshen taste.

Experiment with protein powders or smoothies if needed.

---

When to Seek Medical Advice 🚨

While most side effects are mild and improve: 
⚠️ Persistent vomiting or inability to keep fluids down
⚠️ Severe abdominal pain (especially with nausea/vomiting)
⚠️ Signs of dehydration (dizziness, very dark urine, confusion)
⚠️ Severe constipation lasting several days

Contact your doctor immediately if these occur.

---

Encouragement 💚

✅ Side effects often ease over time.
✅ You are not alone – many in this journey experience similar symptoms.
✅ Gentle, consistent self-care helps your body adjust.
✅ Staying hydrated and nourished will support your medication working well.",1,1751268420.0,WeightLossMedsUK,0,1.0,False

Bradley's War 

By Bradley Clive 

I was born into white fences
and Wednesday night prayers,
where smiles were practiced
and silence polished the floors.

A home where good boys sat straight,
spoke kindly,
and carried their shame like polished shoes—
quietly and without complaint.

We wore Sunday best like armour.
And every word from the pulpit
sounded like love
until it turned to fire
for boys like me.

Even before I knew the shape of my desires,
I knew what they’d name me if I said them out loud.
Unclean. Unnatural.
Spawned from some darkness
they preached against but never dared to understand.

So I became a student of performance.
Thirty years rehearsing how to be
the son they prayed for.
A husband.
A father.
A man who could kill his own truth
and still smile at the dinner table.

But truth has a way of swelling in the silence—
it cracked the walls
I worked so hard to keep clean.

And when it all came down,
I went from a soldier in God’s army
to a man exiled from his own home,
still in uniform,
but facing a war
he was never trained to fight alone.

When you spend a lifetime
fighting a war no one sees,
you learn to ration your hope—
one lie, one breath, one smile at a time.

But wars are greedy.
They chew through your armour,
hollow out your chest,
leave your hands shaking even in silence.

And I—
I was so tired
of holding the weight alone.
So tired
of waking up in a skin
I didn’t ask for.

At first, I only wanted peace.
A pause.
A break in the noise.

I found it
in a shimmer,
in a pipe,
in the hush that followed that first inhale.
Like the world exhaled for me
when I couldn’t anymore.

It felt like power—
clean and fast.
It didn’t judge me.
It didn’t ask me to be someone I wasn’t.
It just lit up the parts of me
I thought had died.

But escape has a price.
And soon, I wasn’t holding the crystal—
it was holding me.

I was already fighting a war alone—
no flag, no battalion,
just the noise in my head
and the weight in my chest.

Each day, a battlefield.
Each smile, a casualty.

I had been holding it all—
the pressure to be okay,
the guilt of being different,
the shame of not being enough—
with hands that were cracked
from pretending to be whole.

And then it happened.
Not one thing, but many.
Too many small fractures
that eventually became collapse.

I lost my job.
The title that had once grounded me.
Gone.

I lost my boys—Lincoln and Dexter—
my heart with legs,
my reason to breathe.
Gone.

And I lost him.
The one man who’d seen through the noise,
who’d held me as if I wasn’t broken,
even when I was.

William.
My anchor and mirror.
Gone.

I became a story unraveling.
And in that chaos,
I reached for something—anything—
to quiet the storm.

The escape came in crystal form.
Beautiful. Deceptive.
Powerful.

At first, it whispered relief.
But soon, it screamed louder
than the pain it replaced.

I wasn’t a man anymore.
Not a father.
Not a partner.
Not someone you’d look up to
or lean on.

I was tethered to a glass pipe
like a baby to a breast,
feeding from the very thing
that had taken everything from me.

The rush didn’t lift me anymore—
it only held back the tremors.
A shaky kind of survival
without purpose,
without dignity.

The shame was suffocating.

I had become the warning in the story,
not the redemption.

And when the silence got too loud,
when I could no longer outrun
my own reflection,
I considered the unthinkable.

I didn’t want to die
to make a point.
I just wanted peace.
To stop being
the disappointment in every room.

No grand gestures.
No letter.
Just disappearance.
Quiet.
Final.

But life clung to me.
Not because I deserved it.
Not because I asked it to.

But because something deep,
some flicker—
not of hope,
but of raw defiance—
refused to let go.

And in that brutal aftermath,
shattered and alone,
I realised something.

Even with nothing left—
no title, no hands in mine,
no voice calling me home—
my life was still
the most precious thing I owned.

Not because it was beautiful,
but because it was mine.
Still breathing.
Still here.
Still capable of more

They talk about recovery
like it’s a ladder—
something you climb
and conquer.

But no one tells you
how slippery each rung is.
How some days
you just sit on the ground
and stare at it,
too tired to try.

There wasn’t a breakthrough.
No bolt of lightning
or cinematic redemption arc.
Just small choices—
minute by minute.

I went to therapy.
I didn’t want to, at first.
But I went.
And I talked.
And for once,
someone didn’t flinch at the truth.

They didn’t try to fix me.
Just listened
until I could hear myself
beneath the noise.

I learned about triggers.
About patterns.
About the way trauma
hides behind everyday choices,
dressing itself in habits
and self-hate.

And still—
I didn’t believe I would win.
This wasn’t a hero’s story.
I didn’t feel brave.
I felt broken.

But I wasn’t alone anymore.

There were hands now—
not holding me up,
but walking beside me.

There were people
who didn’t ask me to be perfect,
only present.

And when I stumbled,
I wasn’t greeted with shame,
but a gentle
“let’s try again.”

I found new tools.
Better ones.
Not weapons,
but instruments.
Routines.
Boundaries.
Honesty.

I learned that sometimes
fighting doesn’t mean swinging—
it means staying.
Breathing.
Trying again tomorrow.

And that’s what healing is.

Not becoming someone else.
But slowly,
quietly,
returning to who you were
before the world taught you
to be afraid of yourself.

I don’t know
if I’ll ever win this war.

But I know this:

If I fall again,
I won’t fall alone.

And for the first time in my life,
that’s enough
to keep going.
Some things
don’t come back.

Not because you didn’t fight hard enough.
Not because you didn’t heal “right.”
But because life
moves forward
whether you're ready or not.

You’ll grieve them
a thousand different ways—
the kids whose laughter
used to fill your home,
the man who loved you once,
and maybe still does
but from a safer distance.

And no amount of good intentions
will rewrite the past.

But this is where peace begins:

In knowing
you don’t have to.

You don’t have to earn forgiveness
to become someone better.
You don’t have to fix everything
to move forward.

Some bridges burn.
Some don’t need rebuilding.
Just remembering—
quietly,
honestly,
without flinching.

So now,
you wake up,
and you make your bed.

You drink water,
go to work,
and show up
for the life you still have.

You breathe
even when it hurts.
You smile
even if it’s small.

And slowly,
the good people arrive.

They don’t ask you
to be perfect—
just present.

They bring no judgment,
only warmth,
and maybe
a spark of something
you haven’t felt in years.

Joy.

Not the wild kind
that screams through parties
or bursts through romance.

But the quiet kind—
the kind that sips coffee
on a balcony at sunrise,
laughs mid-conversation
without guilt,
and lets love in
without begging it to stay.

This isn’t a story
about being saved.

It’s about choosing
to live well
even if no one is watching.

It’s about surviving the storm
and building a garden
from the wreckage.

It’s about you—

still here.

Still fighting.

Still worthy
of joy.",1,1751267921.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
1lo170w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lo170w/my_partner_35m_yelled_at_me_38f_and_my_daughter_5/,My partner (35m) yelled at me (38f) and my daughter (5) today. Then he spent the day belittling me and complaining. Does anyone have advice for coming back from this?,"I wrote this tonight to vent, but I’m thinking about sending it to my partner or maybe trying to work it into a conversation tomorrow… Send it or say it? 

“I started my period tonight, so I’m sure that’s why I’m feeling a little emotional. Today was mostly fun, but I felt like it was interspersed with a lot of negativity. 

Obviously there was what happened this morning… yelling at H to shut up after she interrupted to ask for something different to drink, then calling her spoiled, and telling her you’re “done with her” was an overreaction. I honestly wanted to ask you to apologize to her for saying that. She’s five! That’s so mean and uncalled for. It really broke my heart to hear you say that. 

Then I paused for like three seconds to consider what flavor coffee I wanted and you threatened to drive off. When I tried to explain how that hurt and you need to try being a little more patient, you refused to even hear me out and said I was putting you against H. 

I did mean it when I said I’d try not to do that again, but I also felt like it was a cop out, especially when you said you’d “go home to be the bad guy alone.” That kind of comment is something my mom always did when anyone criticized her. If she ever did anything wrong and we called her out, suddenly she was the worst mom ever, why should she even try? Etc. etc. That’s so unhealthy. 

I love you and you’re so amazing. Our lives are unquestionably better with you here. But that doesn’t mean you’re perfect or that you have to be. You’re allowed to make mistakes, and I’m allowed to take issue with those mistakes. Yelling at both of us this morning bothered me, and I should be able to express that without such a defensive reaction from you. 

Anyway, I made peace by acknowledging I could try to be more supportive of you and firm with H when she’s interrupting or not listening. You’re right that she needs to behave and be respectful. We will work on that. But I did say I’d bring things up in private instead, so that’s what this is. 

For the rest of the day, you seemed generally unhappy with me. Some of it seemed silly at the time, like making fun of me for liking ketchup on hashbrowns. But then you pointed out my white hairs and asked me to dye my hair so I don’t look older than you (even though I am), you said I’m “expensive” (even though that’s only true because I can’t afford your hobbies), you complained about how we ate your ice cream and said I need to control myself (even though we only had one scoop each after you said we could have some). Yesterday you also complained about how I always make you late even though that hasn’t happened in several months since you brought it up. I’ve worked really hard on that. It hurts that you not only haven’t noticed but you also still characterize me as being chronically tardy. 

I know you’re not comfortable verbally expressing your positive feelings toward me, and I’ve always tried to be okay with that. You do generally show your love in other ways, but it gets a lot harder to feel secure about things when you ARE comfortable verbally expressing your negative feelings toward me. It’s unbalanced. I’m left feeling like you don’t even like me, much less like you love me. 

I know that’s ridiculous considering we’re about to move in together, the trip to … and all of the quality time, the financial support, future plans, and the physical affection you show me. But I can’t help it. Today hurt. 

Also, I’ve noticed you’ve been leaving me on read at night a lot more these past few weeks. I’ve always liked how you tell me goodnight and say something sweet before bed, but it’s not happening anymore. 

I know you’ve been stressed, and I’ve asked you in person if we’re okay. You say we are, but I feel like I’m getting mixed signals. Hopefully I’m just overthinking things, but I need some reassurance. Is everything really okay?”

For context: my daughter isn’t his, but he says we’re his family now. 98% of the time, he’s very kind, patient, and supportive… this is honestly the first time he has spoken to us this way, and it hurt. We’ve been together for 2+ years and we just got approved for an amazing three bedroom apartment, but we haven’t signed the lease yet. I never had any doubts until now. Ugh, this sucks. 

We were so happy. Literally just a few weeks ago he got a little tipsy at a party and finally opened up emotionally. He called me his soulmate, we talked about getting married, and decided to move in together. Then we went on an expensive trip which he fully paid for. 

Since then, he’s been stressed at work. He didn’t get a promotion he was hoping for this week, so I know that had him down. Then today he woke up with a bit of a cold. 

I kind of feel like he lashed out at us today, but it was uncharacteristic. 

Still, it hurt, so I wrote down my feelings. Then I gave it to ChatGPT to help me process things… and well… 

It basically said he’s being emotionally manipulative and that we shouldn’t move in together unless he takes full responsibility for today, apologizes, and agrees to work on things (and follows through). 

But that feels a bit dramatic when our relationship is otherwise great (aside from the drop in bedtime texts). Our sex life is still great though, and before this I kind of assumed he’s texting less at night because we’re about to move in together so that will naturally stop anyway. Idk.

After getting married, we both went through a lot of rough times/events, and it really changed us differently. The relationship started when I was 21 and it ended when I'm close to 39. We both grew up differently over time. Intimacy was always an issue throughout the marriage, towards the end we were living like two different strangers. I was really depressed and decided to put and end to it.



During the peak of our divorce, I started training with a PT to get myself back in shape. She is an open lesbian and pretty confident lady. Initially, I just admired her as a person and how good she is at her job. Over time, we spoke about our families and she is an older sister like myself and we discussed college, career, things we like/dislike etc. It's been a long time since someone asked me about what it was like growing up and my childhood (my soft spot). I always avoided the topic of relationships because I was not in a good place during the initial part of the divorce and I was a mess. She never asked me about it either. 



Now that the dust has settled more in my life and also living separately for close to 6mths (most of the divorce paperwork is done). I have had time to sort out my feelings a bit more. I think I have genuine feelings for her (developed over time). When I see her, I feel so happy and my worries just go away, I get butterflies in my stomach. I want to ask her out for coffee and hold hands. Of course, I have not done anything to suggest that I have feelings for her. 



At 39, I never expected to have feelings for anyone. I feel love, confusion and sadness at the same time. I do genuinely like her and feel attracted to her. But I don't know if I should wait and take more time to sort out my life. I feel like I'm starting to like her deeper with time and I don't know if i should tell her my feelings or just quit the training and leave. I know I'll reach a point where I will have a really hard time getting over her. I don't even know if she is single. 



It's a lot to process after getting out of a long term relationship and realizing my sexuality is not what i thought it is. She is the first woman I've really been interested in and attracted to (I have women friends and I'm not interested in anyone. I know this is different)

I don't know what I should do and some days are so difficult. I just wanted to get advice. ",1,1751267285.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,1.0,False
1lo108a,https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/1lo108a/bridezillas_angry_we_didnt_show_up_to_bridal/,"Bridezilla's angry we didn't show up to bridal shower, didn't even know we were invited, ends up getting arrested.","Our family had known ""Julia"" since she was a baby, she's 25 and about to get married next month. I am not particularly close to her, but my sister is best friends with her older sister. My mom who is also friends with her mom (but not bffs) received a ""Save the date"" in May 2025 for a July 2025 wedding addressed solely to her. For reference, my mom is old, old school and doesn't bother with technology, text messages, nor the internet. All of her friends know this. The save the date had a link to The Knot wedding where there's info on the bridal shower which was ""TBD"" when she received it in May and I went on the link attached to the save the date. I didn't pay more attention to it because I didn't receive an invite, only my mom and sister did separately, which is fine bc I'm not close to Julia as I'm easily 15yrs older. 

Yesterday while I'm out with my mom at a church event she invited me to, her phone keeps on beeping and I ask to see it and notice Julia's mom had texted her at 8am that day saying ""Julia's bridal shower is today, I hope to see you here!"" It's 7pm when we see this, suffice to say, she didn't make it. Once home, I ask mom if she's gotten an invite for the wedding, which she has and shows it to me. I go to The Knot website and see that the bridal shower info was updated to the following message ""Ladies, IF YOU WANT to come to the bridal shower, it will be on ___ date at x time. Julia is registered at xyz."" That's it. I asked my mom if she had received a separate bridal shower invite, she says no. Well, too bad, she missed it, she still plans on going to the church service and told Julia and her mom this as she sees them in church. She said she was verbally confirming to them in person since she's not good with technology and would only he attending the church service, nothing else. 

Fast forward to Sunday, I'm having lunch with my mom and dad, and we get a call from my  sister asking why we weren't at the bridal shower, mind you, she was at the shower but didn't even bother to call my mom and ask her where she was. Mom says ""I didn't see the message until 7pm"" and it ends there, or so we thought. Ten minutes later, she gets a call from Julia who asks where we're at, my mom tells her we're having lunch at X place and just ordered thinking nothing of it. This psycho shows up to the restaurant with her mom in tow and starts yelling at my mom for not showing up at the bridal shower. Please keep in mind my sister is not in the wedding party, we're not blood related and neither is my mom her aunt, godmother, nor mother of the groom. She goes on and on about how the shower was ruined as she expected us both to show up with gifts.  Excuse me? Dad asks them both to leave as this is getting ridiculous. They both keep going.

My mom is looking like WTF deer in the headlights confused and embarrassed by how she's making a scene. At this point, I stand up and ask her to leave, she insists on making a scene and I tell her that as far as I'm concerned, proper wedding etiquette is to send a separate invite for the bridal shower and not to expect guests to constantly be checking her website for wedding updates, her wedding is not news worthy to the rest of us which clearly upsets her more. Her mom during this interaction is DEAD SILENT just standing behind her. I tell Julia that for formal events, you send out proper invitations, and confirm with guests by calling them to confirm their attendance, not by text message on the day of the actual event, or via internet links. And if her focus of why we didn't attend was solely based on monetary gifts bc that's all the registry had-- gift cards or cash gifts, then maybe she should get a second job. In any case, her behavior was enough for my mom to finally stand up and tell her she would not be attending the wedding of such a poorly behaved young woman who clearly was going through some problems where she found my mom to be an emotional punching bag.

This crazy bridezilla was not having it, she threw a cup of hot coffee at my mom in a hissy fit. Before I could slap this bish, there happened to be a cop with this partner picking up food who happened to witness the whole spectacle. They quickly rushed over and charge her with battery. And yes, my mom did agree to press charges.  The coffee thankfully was not hot, but the damage was done. 

The kicker? My sister calls us later, visibly upset and crying saying that Julia's mom had called her and was sad to let her know she was no longer invited because my mom was having a bad day and chose to be rude to Julia. When we told her what actually happened she was livid. The ultimate kicker here is that the day after her religious wedding (on Wednesday bc she's trying to save $$), she is traveling out of the country for a 2nd wedding abroad. Am I petty enough to motion the court to change the date of appearance to her actual wedding date or the day she's to fly out or ask the judge to confiscate her passport bc she could be a flight risk? Maybe. 

The point being, send a GD separate bridal shower invite and don't go bat shit crazy if people who didn't RSVP, nor knew they were invited in the first place don't show up, and yeah, don't throw coffee at anyone you psycho.",66,1751267080.0,bridezillas,6,0.93,False

Throwaway and I'm still terrified someone will find this. The title isn't exactly what's going on and I do have to apologize, as things are a bit complicated and this is going to be long..

   So my mom (45) is living with my dad in the suburbs of our country. He owns the house they live in and he pays all the bills, even groceries so she practically has no living expenses. 

  I inherited a house from my grandfather that is in the capital of our country and it's rented to a family. It has consistently been occupied by the same family since it was built, so rent has been coming in every month for almost 20 years. When my grandad was alive and the house was in his name, he had allowed my mom to manage the house. That is, she was collecting the rent and acting like a landlord. It was practically her house, but HE was paying the taxes. She also owns another apartment on the same building.

   She says, and it's probably true, that when the building was built (~2005) she took out a loan of 200k to build both apartments, but because my granddad's apartment wasn't in her name, the loan is only attached to her apartment. So what I inherited technically had no amount owed, but morally it would. 

  A little bit about my situation. I am a student, I work in the summers in my hometown and my father practically supports me during semesters, as he insists I don't work to focus on my studies, my parents keep their finances separate. I live in a house in the capital that was my grandfather's and it's where we spent his final years together. My mother has now inherited the house, although the process isn't legally completed. She does pay for the bills I think, which come to about 150/mo. I have family visit every month, mostly for doctor's appointments (we have a big family).

  A little bit a bout her situation. The rent in my house that she manages is 550/mo, in hers it's 650/mo. She receives about 1200/mo from her work and 700/mo from my sister ( my sis A and her hubby own a company in another country. Mum has a legal position, but she doesn't do anything. The plan is for her to get more involved in retirement). She also works during the summer season (May to September), but I don't know how much she makes from that.

  My granddad passed away in 2022 and I was taking care of him in his later days. I have always believed my mum and truly thought that she needed the money to pay the loan, so I haven't interfered at all with the pre-existing situation. However..

  I recently found out, that since my granddad passed, she hasn't payed a cent of taxes. I had noticed an amount owed the first year of his passing, which was about 1k and had talked to her. At the time she had said she would take care of it and even set up payments of 100/mo. I had even stressed to her how important it was for me not to owe money, as I had seen both my parents struggle with debt my entire life and didn't want that for myself (they are not as strained now, although not debt free either). She assured me she would take care of it. 

  Fast forward to about a month ago and as I was doing my taxes I saw a message. Welp, she didn't take care of it.. The amount owed now is over 4k. 

  I tried talking to her when I saw it, as my parents were visiting at the time, but she said she didn't want dad to know, and I respected that. Afterwards I was trying to talk to her over the phone about it, but either she didn't have time, or dad was around. Once I finally caught her at a time she was alone and had a few minutes to spare I brought up the subject. Her composure immediately changed. When before she would've been calm and overly sweet, now she was angry and on attack mode. I was trembling and holding back tears. I don't like making my parents sad or angry (I'm the youngest of 3 by almost a decade. My parents have a strained marriage and when I was little I would try and calm them both down as to either avoid or stop a fight. And they fought A LOT. It got so bad over the years that everyone in my hometown knows how much they fight and I've heard comments from people like ""why don't they break up already"". At one point a rumor was started that they had, and people were calling them asking if it was true. Back to the phonecall). 

  Basically what she told me is that the monthly payment on the loan has gotten to 1200, that she hasn't even payed her taxes and that she barely has 100 at the end of the month to get a coffee, so she can't afford to pay the taxes. I asked why she wouldn't talk to me about it and instead simply hid it. She got even more angry. I did say that since she is getting the rent she should be dealing with the taxes. She got pissed at that and said that if I want to start collecting the rent myself I would have to take out a loan of 50k, give her the money. I can't remember exactly how the conversation went, as I was very emotional, but I tried to explain how hurtful it was for her to hide that from me. She ended up apologising, but in a very angry tone. I didn't want to continue, so I left it at that.

  Now we're at the point right before I start work and I got a message from the tax people that if I don't at least set up a payment plan they have the right to withhold my wages. I sent it to my mom on insta and she liked it. Double tap, heart emoji liked. Didn't say a single word.

  I should also say atp that I have given her about 1.5k from my wages for what would be my portion of the debt for what my granddad has left me, however the process hasn't been completed yet and I have seen no documents on what I would owe. I do though have her recognition of that amount and what it's for in text.

  I am now thinking that the best course of action is for us to separate our finances. I will of course move out of her house when I come back as I am now on a train to my hometown, but I also don't want her involved in my house anymore. She is obviously refusing to deal with the taxes and it has already put me in a difficult financial situation that I don't want getting worse. I also have no plans in taking out a loan for any reason. She has been recieving the rent on that house for almost 20 years, no tax, and it definitely comes out to enough to cover half that loan and then some. Rent has obviously gone up, but I don't think it was ever under 400.

  I am planning to tell her that from now on she will be cut out of my house, but I am very very scared of how that will go down. It would have to be when we're alone, as no one that knows her, no one from our home town and not even my dad knows about this situation. If it were in public she would probably be reserved, but in private she will go full force. Also I am scared that she will tell A and they will tag team me. She was never kind to my sister (A), but now A is very successful (and kinda rich) and they're besties. 

  My sister has a weak spot for her and will support her no matter what. I love A to death, as she is the most amazing human being you will ever meet and trusting our mom that much is her only fault. I say this as my mom has been very unkind to both my sisters in the past and they have told me most of the things she's done. We would sometimes joke that she has a sickness with money. My problem doesn't even compare. A has been saying how mom's changed and she's different with me. I now see it probably had nothing to do with who I am, but she still was kinder to me.

  So Reddit, here I am. I can't talk about this to people that know us, so I turn to you. My friends and bf, although they try to help, I don't think they can understand the situation fully. Please tell me if I would be the ah if I moved out and took control of my house.

   Thnx for reading ❤️

Downside is, as the car gets hot, the scent fades fast.

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.  
You've got this! Let's make this Monday a productive and awesome one. ✨",1,1751266866.0,3AMALONE,0,1.0,False
1lo0y6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowpeak/comments/1lo0y6i/need_ideas_for_first_igt_setup/,Need ideas for first IGT setup,"I'm looking at putting together my first IGT for two people. I'd like to keep it a 3 unit and 400mm height. The reason for a 3 unit is that I envision using it mostly outside my Alpha Breeze with low beach chairs. I see myself using it as a coffee bar setup in the mornings, but also can see myself using the IGT at a park and picnic with it. I have a Takibi tarp and I can see using the IGT at the beach under the tarp for a nice afternoon cooking and eating in the shade.  I'm undecided whether I should get an Entry IGT or a regular IGT 3. I own a Jikaro and like the idea of connecting the IGT to the Jikaro and using it as an extra table or have a burner to use along with the Takibi. I also like the ease of the Entry IGT for a quick setup. I'm not sure if it would be as versatile as regular IGT. 

On my wish list I have a flat burner, a pair of sliding extensions so I can have extra table top surface, a shallow IGT low hanging shelf for extra storage of stuff that wouldn't need to be on the top, and a stainless half box and hanger to be able to store napkins or seasonings off the side of the table. I'm also considering the grill burner to use along with the flat burner for grilled meats and veggies. With all these add-ons I'm wondering if the IGT will be too busy for a 3 unit or if it becomes too heavy to carry everything to a spot on a beach or a picnic table if I can't park next to where I'm going to be using it. 

This all started as a way to make coffee outside my tent. Now I'm stuck wanting everything and I'm not sure if everything would get used. Lol. Should I be considering a 4 unit instead? Two different IGT's? Ugh, decisions decisions.

Please give me your ideal IGT setup and what you would do if you were starting a brand new IGT system.

I wrapped up a full-scale kitchen remodel last month and wanted to share a few hard-earned lessons. Maybe they save you a headache or two.

First thing I learned is that the price tag grows quicker than you expect. My original quote looked fine on paper, but once walls came down we found a couple of wiring issues and a sneaky leak behind the sink. Having a cushion in the budget kept the stress level down when those surprises popped up.

Next came layout choices. I spent way too long staring at pretty inspiration photos before asking myself how I actually cook. In the end I kept most appliances in the same spots, but widened the workspace between stove and sink so two people can prep side by side without bumping elbows. That one change feels like a luxury every single day.

Lighting turned out to be the quiet hero. I added under-cabinet LED strips on a dimmer and a simple pendant over the island. Dinner prep is brighter, late-night snacking is softer, and the whole room looks more finished even before the coffee’s brewed.

Storage decisions mattered more than fancy finishes. Deep drawers for pots and pans beat traditional lower cabinets, and a skinny pull-out next to the range holds oils, spices, and cutting boards in easy reach. These small upgrades make cooking faster and cleanup easier, which is the real win.

Communicating with the [contractor](https://evergreenremodelers.com/) every morning kept the project moving. A quick check-in about that day’s tasks caught problems early, like when the tile shipment arrived with the wrong grout color. Five minutes of talking saved a full day of rework.

Last tip: be kind to future-you during the demolition phase. I set up a temporary mini-kitchen in the garage with a hot plate, microwave, and the old fridge. It looked ridiculous but kept takeout costs reasonable and morale intact.

If anyone’s curious about specific fixtures or timeline details just ask. Happy to share receipts, brand names, whatever helps. Good luck to anyone about to swing the first hammer. It’s chaotic, but cooking the first meal in a space you designed yourself feels amazing.

1lo0ta7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1lo0ta7/stuck_behind_slow/,Stuck Behind Slow,"I hit the road with purpose, clear in my head—
Let’s make good time and burn some tread.
But five minutes in, I’m trapped in a line
Of Sunday drivers on a Monday grind.

Blinker on since ’98,
Doing thirty-five in a fifty-eight.
Coasting through life in a lazy parade,
Like they’re waiting for traffic to part and obey.

“These idiots drive so fast, I have to ride my brakes to keep up with them,”
I mutter, stuck behind Grandpa Jim.

One’s on their phone, one’s lost in thought,
One’s doing five under—proudly, a lot.
I’m screaming inside, foot bouncing with rage,
While they idle through green lights like it’s all staged.

I’m not asking for NASCAR, just pick up the pace,
Or get off the road and give me some space.
I’ve got places to be and miles to burn,
But every slowpoke thinks it’s their turn.

And then there’s that genius in rush hour glory,
Who spun out and flipped—end of story.
Now we’re parked on the interstate, bumper to dot,
In what I call a High Speed Parking Lot.

No hustle, no hurry, no mirror glance,
Just floating through traffic in a sleepy trance.
And if I tap the gas? They slam on the brake,
Like I’m the problem in their coffee break.

Another one merges at eight miles an hour,
Mid-ramp—like he’s driving a lawn mower.
No signal, no clue, just dead in the zone,
Probably thinking this lane is his own.

I’m not the issue—I’m the fire,
The engine alive, the focused desire.
But stuck behind slow, I grind my gears,
Wasting time and collecting years.

So yeah—“they’re driving so fast” I’m dragging my shoes,
Riding my brakes like I’ve got nothing to lose.
But one day I’ll pass, and leave ‘em behind—
Until I get stuck behind their cousin… in kind.

Matched with a girl on Tinder. Same fashion taste, some rapport. I like to meet matches quickly, so I asked her to grab coffee that week. She agreed to Saturday but overslept. Rescheduled to Sunday, which went fine. There was some romantic tension. We tried to go elsewhere after but everything was closed. Agreed to meet again soon.

That next week, she kept rescheduling. Thursday to Friday to Monday. I told her we could chill for now and she should hit me when she’s more free. She insisted Monday worked. We met, had a nice time, even talked about a third date.

Then silence for two days. I assumed we mutually ghosted. She later replied to my IG story offering to film content together. I flirted. She gave a dry response. I left it.

Later, I asked if she was still down to film. She said yes but kept shifting days due to exams. I adjusted my schedule twice. She said she’d be free after 4:30 Friday. No word from her at 4:30, 5, or 6. She texted at 10 PM saying she got distracted sewing and forgot to eat.

I told her maybe our schedules don’t line up and she should hit me when she’s free. She said she’d be more available in the summer. I said “bet, glad to hear” and didn’t hear back for days. So I unfollowed her and removed her as a follower.

She re-followed me and DM’d asking if that was intentional. I said yeah, the energy felt one-sided, but if she still wanted to hang, she could send a day and time. She said “So you felt the need to unfollow me over that?”

I told her “The energy felt off so I did what made sense to me. Not being spiteful.”

She said if my issue is her being busy, then it’s not gonna work since she’ll only get busier in September.

I haven’t replied yet. AITAH?

So last year I realized I was paying way too much for Netflix (like $15/month for the Premium plan 💀), and I couldn’t justify it anymore, especially with other subscriptions piling up.

I started looking around Reddit/Telegram for alternatives, and eventually found people offering legit family/shared plans for a tiny price (I won’t say exact number but let’s say cheaper than coffee ☕).

At first I was skeptical – you know the usual scam worries – but I found someone who actually replaced accounts when one stopped working and even gave support. I’ve been using it ever since with no issues.

If anyone is in the same boat and tired of overpaying, there are options out there – just be smart, avoid shady links, and always test first.

Can DM if you’re curious where I got mine.

1lo0nwd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lo0nwd,Am I Overreacting for Wanting to get a Restraining Order Against My Ex for Texting Me?,"My (23f) ex boyfriend (24m) cannot seem to leave me alone.

We were together for 3 years and I found out that pretty much throughout our entire relationship he would attempt to cheat on me. I forgave him for cheating several times that I knew about during the relationship as well.

We met while I was 19 and he was 20 and we were happy for quite a bit of the relationship. Over time though things became very toxic, he started drinking a lot, which at first o chalked up to being newly 21 and wanting to have fun, but then quickly it became clear he had an issue. His drinking became so excessive his parents told him he could no longer work in a restaurant setting because the access to alcohol was not helping him in anyway.

He would still drink to excess and started to become belligerent. There were nights that we would be perfectly fine and out of no where he would start being verbally and sometimes physically abusive. Aside from all the other concerning stuff we just didn’t really have a lot in common. We could relate on things we liked as hobbies or shows or games, but when it came down to our social compatibility we were sorely lacking.

His idea of fun was staying out all night and getting trashed with his (awful) friends. He always had to be one of the last ones to leave a party and didn’t want to go to a bar if he couldn’t play pool.

My idea of fun is very different, I enjoy bookstores and coffee shops, going out to get something to eat or going to a poetry slam or event. I enjoy the occasional party but I don’t want to be there forever.

He never wanted to hang out with my friends or family and I started to feel very isolated. I always had to hang out with his friends or I wouldn’t get to see him often. This came to a head when I was so exhausted begging for things to change and them not changing. One day he called me drunk and was telling the whole bar about how he gets to (do bedroom things) with me, and basically just said disgusting vulgar things to strangers while I wasn’t even there.

I was with my friends and eventually I stopped answering his calls. I put him on speaker while he was talking just so I didn’t feel crazy— everyone around him would defend him and say he was this great guy so when he’d do horrible stuff  felt like nobody believed me or could see him acting that way. He said something racist and I hung up because I was more than fed up with him. He texted me saying he was done with me and I was so relieved.

However the next day and over the following weeks he wanted us to work through it and tried over and over to get me back. At first I was conflicted until I decided I didn’t want to live that life anymore. (For those wondering why I stayed in an abusive situation for so long it’s because I date for marriage and I genuinely thought we could get back to where we were when we first started dating.)

Anyways flash forward to today I have a new boyfriend I’ve been seeing since March, and we are very happy. My ex stalks my accounts and has shown up to my job and my home to leave me notes, this behavior stopped for a while when I threatened to call the police if I saw him again but he recently texted me from a unknown number. I’m considering getting a restraining order even though I haven’t heard from him since I blocked this new number. Am I Overreacting?

TLDR: abusive ex boyfriend sends me texts from a different number after going no contact and him previously trying to reach me before. Should I get a restraining order or am I overreacting ?",2,1751265737.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.67,False

1lo0j6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1lo0j6k/snakes_snakes_everywhere/,Snakes. Snakes everywhere.,"My partner and I went to a coffee shop and they didn’t have the food we wanted, I genuinely had a stroke and couldn’t say “steeped tea” (I’m not sure if it’s related to the main event but I guess I’m setting the overall tone of the dream). They messed up my drink so I was pissed off. 

Anyways, we were driving around looking for food but for some reason I got out of the car (my partner was driving), and just walked. I’m walking down some streets I don’t know but in my city, then somehow we get to a park. My partner parked the car and we’re walking through the trails but we passed through a wooded area that’s absolutely infested by snakes, big ones too. The first time they kinda eyed us down but didn’t bug us because we didn’t bug them, then we decide to do another lap while we decide where to get food. This time around we paused before the snake area and we’re just talking when someone comes running from the snake area. We completely ignored that and continued on our walk but this time I’m pointing out how massive these snakes are, the second biggest snake ends up trying to strike us. Of course it’s right near the end of the path, me being the hero I am; I smack his head when he strikes and grabs his head like the snake handlers do and I got my partner to pass through. Then somehow he moved in a way that he could bite my hand, being unsure if it was poisonous I made my partner take a picture to show the ambulance, as were walking away from the area (I didn’t want to run and increase my heart rate and make the poison spread faster but we needed to get out of there so we didn’t meet another friend) I used a hoodie as a tourniquet. 

That’s when I woke up. Looking back at my dream I’m pretty sure it was a boa constrictor or a python of some sort; I don’t know my snakes. All I know is the first time around I was pointing out how beautiful they were, despite feeling uneasy at their size. I don’t know if I should interpret it as me being insecure in my relationship, a warning since someone who harmed me in the past is now back in my life, or a warning of a situation in my life.

he continued talking to ppl hours before he arrived home. 

i feel so sick. it’s been almost 6 months and my nervous system flares the moment i feel safe. the moment life feels normal. i am so scared to be blindsided. 
this is both of our second marriages and truly i never saw this coming. 
he says it was because he was extremely horny and didn’t want to bother me but i fear he just can’t handle a monogamous married life. 
that children and life are boring and he can’t live in that reality. 
He has begged me to stay and he is willing to do whatever it takes but i am so shattered. who i was died that day, and i don’t know if i will ever be okay. i have never felt betrayal like this before.

1lo0hle,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1lo0hle/tried_keto_acv_gummies_for_a_month_here_are_the/,"Tried keto ACV gummies for a month, here are the pros and cons most people won’t mention","I decided to give **Keto ACV Gummies** a shot after seeing them pop up everywhere. I’m not someone who jumps into trends easily, but I’ve been trying to lose weight steadily and thought this might support the process without requiring me to cut out entire food groups or drink vinegar shots every morning.

After using them daily for about 30 days, here’s my honest breakdown of what worked, what didn’t, and whether I’d recommend them.

**what they are and how they’re supposed to work**

These **ACV keto gummies** combine two trendy ingredients, apple cider vinegar and BHB ketones, into a single chewable. According to most labels (and plenty of reviews), the goal is to help your body reach a state of **ketosis**, where it burns fat instead of carbs for energy. Supposedly, this can lead to easier weight loss, more energy, and fewer cravings.

They’re also supposed to be gentler on your stomach than drinking raw vinegar and easier to stick with than a strict keto diet.

**the pros (from my experience)**

**1. Reduced appetite**  
One of the first things I noticed after the first few days was a definite drop in random snacking. I didn’t crave sweets or bread the same way I normally do around 3 p.m., which helped me cut back on unnecessary calories.

**2. Mild energy boost**  
I wouldn’t say I felt wired or anything dramatic, but my energy didn’t crash like it sometimes does after lunch. That steady alertness was a plus, and I didn’t need my usual second cup of coffee.

**3. Easy to take**  
If you’ve tried actual apple cider vinegar, you know it’s harsh. These gummies tasted sweet and a little tangy, but they didn’t upset my stomach at all. Definitely more convenient than liquid ACV or even capsules.

**4. Mild weight change**  
After 4 weeks, I lost a little under 5 pounds. Not groundbreaking, but considering I didn’t make major changes to my routine, it was a nice surprise. I think these work best as a support tool, not a magic fix.

I used this version: [**Keto ACV Gummies full info here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L8QR5SR/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**the cons (what didn’t wow me)**

**1. No instant results**  
If you’ve read **keto gummies reviews** that promise huge losses in the first week, take those with a grain of salt. This isn’t a fat-melting miracle. It took over a week to even feel anything different.

**2. Not a replacement for healthy habits**  
These gummies might help reduce cravings and support ketosis, but they won’t work if your diet is still high in sugar and processed carbs. If you’re wondering **does keto gummies work for weight loss**, the answer is: only if you’re making some effort.

**3. Varying effectiveness**  
Some friends I talked to didn’t notice anything while using similar products. So if you're looking for the **best keto gummies**, results may vary based on your body, your habits, and even which brand you choose.

**4. Not always available in stores**  
People asked if they could find **keto gummies CVS**, but the brand I used isn’t in big-name stores yet - just online. And from what I’ve seen, some knockoff brands have different keto gummies ingredients, so it’s worth checking the label.

This is where I ordered from: [**Keto Gummies product page**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L8QR5SR/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**final thoughts**

If you’re looking for a way to gently support your weight loss routine without completely overhauling your diet, these **keto gummies for weight loss** could be a helpful tool. They seemed to help with appetite control and low-key energy boosts.

But if you’re expecting to drop major weight without changing anything else, you’ll probably be disappointed.

Overall, I’d say they’re worth trying if you understand what they *can* and *can’t* do. If anyone else has used them long-term, I’d be curious to hear how your results compare.

Also, if you’ve had a weird reaction or experienced a **keto gummies side effect**, please share. I didn’t have any, but it’s always good to know what others have run into.",1,1751265035.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I don’t really like food that much. I eat because apparently I have to, otherwise I’ll die. Which is bad. Apparently.

So I like to eat plainish stuff, and I decline when offered things I know I won’t like. This is seen as a mortal sin by nearly everyone I’ve been forced to share a meal with.

“Just try it! It’s not spicy! Are you allergic?!”

No thanks, I don’t believe you, and no, respectively.

Unfortunately I work in a cafe/restaurant so I’m surrounded by foodies. So many times I’ve ordered a couple of eggs and some toast for my staff meal and have been presented with a plate of eggs, toast, and other bullshit. The other bullshit goes straight into the chicken scraps and without fail, the chef will ask me what’s wrong with his food.

THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BRO, WE’VE BEEN THROUGH THIS NEARLY EVERY FKN DAY.

Stop giving me shit I don’t want when I’ve explicitly told you I don’t want it! Also stop asking me for a reason as to why I don’t consume the same food you do. I’ve run out of ways to say “I don’t like it” and have that end the conversation. It’s not a debate, fuckers! You literally can’t make me eat it! Why do you want to force someone to eat something?! This is very strange behaviour.

I served a lady today and she wanted a coffee with five sugars and requested that I not judge her for the five sugars. I told her I couldn’t care less what someone wants in a drink that I’m not drinking and she beamed and was very grateful because every other cafe has had some kind of reaction to her order and it made her feel bad.

Twice Approached Then Ghosted,"I’m a 64-year-old senior citizen living in Dubai—fit, healthy, and fully capable of working for another 10–15 years. I’ve got 40 years of experience in IT ERP systems. But a recent episode has confused me, and I’d like your thoughts

*  Beginning of 2025: On LinkedIn founder of a new manufacturing company reached out, asking me to mentor his team on ERP implementation. We met twice (coffee shop + his office), and he even introduced me to his outsourced team, confirming I was ""the right person."" After agreeing on terms (remote work, weekly site visits, equipment needed), I sent a follow-up email… . No replies to calls, emails, or WhatsApp. I moved on.
*  June 2025: Out of the blue, *he messages me again*, asking to meet. I went to his office, repeated the same discussions, and even offered to work *for free* (he insisted on paying ""whatever budget allowed""). Guess what? *Silence again.*

Can it be?

* If it’s my **age (64)**, why approached me *twice*? He knew my age upfront and sought my expertise. Is experience/wisdom undervalued?
* Is *he* indecisive? Does he not know what he wants?
* Are his expectations mismatched? If so, why not communicate?
* Or is this just poor professionalism (ghosting after initiation)?
* Questionable EQ? care a least

As older professionals, do we get dismissed after the ""idea"" phase? Or is this just a ""him"" problem? Curious to know.",5,1751264898.0,UAE,15,0.73,False

Hello everyone, after a year of trial and error, during which I took apart several espresso machines and reassembled them, sold them, and kept them, I ended up making one for someone I know in a technical way that I wanted. We are pleased to present the Gaggia Classic V2 (Sin 035U / RI9403/11) with a stainless steel boiler of approx. 200ml. The modification was made on a tight student budget. I know I bought the espresso machine for 80 euros and all the modifications cost the same amount at most.

These changes could certainly be made more aesthetically pleasing, but we wanted to get the first change out of the way and, of course, we worked with what we had. Fortunately, taste buds don't see how everything is organized inside or what changes have been made, they just taste it.

The modifications made are as follows:

1. Soundproofed the interior of the case
2. Insulated the thermal boiler
3. Soundproofed the water pump
4. Insulated the water tray and water tank to attenuate vibrations
5. Added PID + Pressure Gauge + Dimmer
6. Added 3D printed top case

7\*. A silicone ring to increase the filter holder's grip in the group and, of course, to tighten it to the “perfect” half

Improvements include temperature stability, the ability to adjust the water flow as desired to create a profile, and significantly reduced noise (it can be reduced even further, to below 50db). Possible questions would be:

1. “Is it worth doing this myself? Is it as difficult as others say?”

Whether it's worth it or not is up to you. Do you want a long-distance racehorse that will easily last you a decade, or do you want the newer, “sophisticated” machines that are programmed to break down? Do you want an espresso machine that you can repair/improve yourself, or do you want to pay a specialist to repair it for you? Are you interested in whether the boiler is made of food-grade stainless steel, or are you fine with aluminum or copper? How often do you want to maintain your espresso machine?

As we all know, aluminum and copper can suffer various types of damage that make them harmful to the human body (e.g., various solutions incompatible with the type of boiler, scratching of the boiler surface). In the case of stainless steel, we can see that it would not have these types of problems. Plus, guess what? The aluminum boiler on the Gaggia Classic V1 (pre-2015) only has an 80ml capacity inside. Can we still talk about temperature stability if you replace a little over a quarter of the total water in the boiler when extracting coffee?

I wouldn't think that modifying or repairing it would be difficult, as there are various tutorials (if you take the time to look) + posts about it. In addition, I am attaching all the images with the necessary connections and steps to make this modification (which I haven't seen anyone else do, even if they modified a Gaggia Color, Gaggia Dose, or Gaggia Pure). If you have some cables at home (they can be from an extension cord), some connectors, and some skill, you will succeed

(this modification is fully compatible with Gaggia Color, Gaggia Dose, and Gaggia Pure); I haven't had similar devices to give my opinion on others.

2. “Wouldn't it be better to buy a new one (e.g., Lelit Anna, Gaggiuino, Gaggia Evo/Evo pro)?”

It depends on what you want. I preferred to buy only stainless steel boilers, so I could easily repair and modify them. Their quality is adequate, good enough to make delicious espresso or other milk-based drinks on a tight budget

3.  “How long did it take you?”

Well, the work itself, if you have all the necessary tools, shouldn't take more than 2 hours. If you needed to research various topics, watch videos, and, of course, understand how it works, it would take longer. I can't estimate how long it took me because I did it in stages and the modification took a longer period of time.

All the parts were purchased from Aliexpress (I can't give an approximate price because it varies depending on the country and, of course, discounts). As far as I remember, for all the parts mentioned and modified, I spent a maximum of 70-80 euros (it was certainly less, but I prefer to have a margin of error). I will leave links to all the products I purchased, the necessary parts, and, of course, the dimensions for each product. Try to find them as cheaply as possible, create new accounts so you can benefit from the discount for the first product

If you need help or have any questions, I am available whenever time allows

If I have omitted anything, please let me know and I will correct/add it to the post. I preferred it to be functional on the inside (even if it doesn't look very aesthetic in some places). If you have a larger budget, I recommend choosing a thicker soundproofing material (at least 1 cm or 1.5/2 cm if you want to get rid of the sound). I recommend soundproofing the water pump (of course, leaving the joints uninsulated, only the fixed parts). If you have problems with the group's feet being worn out and you don't think it's appropriate to pay 45-50 euros for a new group head, you can also use the silicone mats that I have attached below. Between the new temperature sensor and the original Gaggia support, you will need to add a specific material. Some people have used washers, but I preferred to use a fairly thick copper wire, bent to form a washer to ensure that it does not affect the sensor reading in any way.

For the printed parts, I will also attach the STL files in case anyone is interested.

I will also leave all the settings made for the XMT7100 PID on this 2016 Gaggia Classic with stainless steel boiler so that it can be replicated as closely as possible (if the boiler is not insulated, I cannot guarantee that these settings will work the same).

(Real reason i didn’t get the prize is that i was told the submission time had already passed after 12 hours and they didn’t even tell this before 24 hours🙃)

I put the map on the table and left my new house. Now that i didn’t even have a sealed artifact the only way i could get stronger was by advancing.

But I didn’t even know the corresponding name of the potion let alone the formula. Then i had an idea. 

There was no way the police didn’t know anything about mysticism. Although they would call beyonders from church if they got into trouble some of them should at least know the powers of lower sequence beyonders to protect themselves.

I went back to my house again and checked put the map. I memorized every corner of the station then burned the map.

Then i went to a restaurant near the station. They didn’t sell alcohol but that didn’t matter. I ordered a coffee and watched the cat. It was acting like reading books. 

Although that was a marvelous sight i started spying on the station once my order had arrived. 

Through one of the windows i saw one cop preparing to leave. This was my chance to infiltrate as the best time fore robbery is the time of guards changing.

I paid for the coffee. Because the coffee was expensive I didn’t leave any tip. Then i went inside the station like i was going to make a complaint.

Then with the excuse of going to restroom i left the waiting place. Because i was being escorted i went into the restroom. The cop was waiting for me outside. 

I immediately went out of the window and jumped to the higher floor. I checked out to see inside. Like I guessed it was empty.

I went inside. This was the room of the chief. He had already left with the change of guards. I started searching every file there. Although i was quick it wasn’t fast enough. 

Since it was important information i must have looked for the most important looking file. Then i used my ability of a marauder to locate the most important files. I looked for them one by one and found what i was looking for. 

I directly stole the file as I didn’t have time to memorize all of them. Although i could memorize only my path i wanted to learn more about other pathways too.

I hid the file in my clothes and went to the lower floor again. I flushed and washed my hands before leaving. Then i went to make a complaint. It was about my noisy neighbor…

At home i memorized the swindler formula. The file had information about all low sequences powers but it had the formula of some certain pathways that more often committed crimes.

I burned the file after memorizing the content because i learned of how powerful divination could be from the file. 

From now on i was going to buy the ingredients of the swindler formula instead of waiting for the characteristic. Even if they didn’t sold them i could try to get those ingredients myself.
