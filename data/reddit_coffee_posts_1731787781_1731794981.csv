1gsya5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gsya5h/how_long_is_too_long_for_a_second_date/,How long is too long for a second date?,"I went on a date a little over a week ago. It was just coffee but lasted a couple of hours. He texted about 30 minutes after I got home from the date to follow up, and we have texted every few days since. He hasn't asked me on a second date yet even though the first one went really well and there is nothing hinting that he doesn't like me. We are both adults (late 30's) with busy lives, but I thought he would have mentioned a second one by now.

I'm so used to the weird games people play nowadays, love bombing, constant communication, fast track multiple dates in a row in a short period of time, and then ghost when I don't sleep with them. Since he is not pushing for immediate gratification, I am wondering if what he is doing is actually normal. It feels more like what it was before the fast pace and convenience of modern day technology. 

All of that said, how long should I wait for a second date before assuming there won't be one?",1,1731794750.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1gsy6aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1gsy6aw/should_i_ask_him_out/,Should I ask him out???,"There's this guy I want to ask out. for comtext, I am a female and sophomore, and he is a junior. I met him through theatre and he is my dance partner for one of the songs we do. this is the first show he has done, so this is why i have only just met him. He is very quiet, only sits with his brother at lunch, and I don't think he has ever had a girlfriend (he got a really good haircut and a few other things, and so I would say he has had a massive glow up, and I think he is very cute.

why I like him:
-very cute, and 50% of people that agree with me, and the other 50% think that he would be cute with better glasses and outfits (idc about that), so I'm not crazy in thinking that he it cute
-really really nice!
-lowkey unknown
-he is a very good singer

Reasons why I think I should ask him out:
-we are not close friends, it is very low risk! it's not that deep if he never speaks to me again.
-because he has only just had a glow up, and he did not look too amazing last year(me too, I can't judge!), I am 99% sure he has never had a girlfriend, or probably much female attention. more likely for him to say yes
-during our dance number together, he always looks me in the eye and we have a very hard time not giggling (rizz??)
-because he is so quiet, he doesn't have a lot of friends, so there is not a lot of people for him to tell if he rejects me
-he is super nice and amazing and has so much boyfriend potential
-I can just tell he could never ask a girl out, so if I do it soon, it won't be awkward if we become better friends, which will happen because he is doing the next show which is starting next week after our last show weekend.
-I've had a few people tell me I'm out of his league, which I don't know if I agree with, but maybe that means he is more likely to say yes to a date??


REASONS WHY I SHOULDNT:
-his mother is my English teacher. if he does reject me that would be really akward every day because I participate in that class. would be super embarrassing
-I have never had a real boyfriend, only a few girlfriends in middle school. being bisexual might be a dealbreaker for some guys and he definitely does not know that I am, so that makes me nervous.
-being rejected would be hella embarrassing. he doesn't have snap or insta so I can't connect that way. I already have his number from a group chat, so I can't ask for it as a first move. also because I'm a girl I feel more nervous making the first move.
-I will see him a lot if he rejects me because of the next show coming up, and we are in a small ensemble together for choir



Overall, I'm really nervous on if I should or not, because a lot of people don't even go on dates before starting to date because of snap culture. if I ask him on a date, it would be for coffee or smth to get to know him better. also I have never asked somebody out so idk how.",1,1731794453.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1gsy5s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1gsy5s6/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1gsy3yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gsy3yh/chronic_depression/,Chronic depression,"It’s so strange to me that I’ve only now realized that I have chronic depression. I’ve known I’ve been depressed for over a decade, but it just never clicked for me until recently that it’s classified as a chronic illness.

A lot of days I just… live with it. I think I was born sad, and I’m never Not sad, but that’s just how I’m built, I think. I’ve never lived without sadness, even if it's just a small thought in the very back of my mind.

Even when I'm feeling okay or even happy, there's just a fog that always hangs over me. I'm only 20, but I have a feeling this dread might never go away. I think I'm okay with it, only if it's because I might have to be. I've been on SSRIs for over a decade-- started young with trying out different meds until we found one that worked. I can't even really say if I was lucky for it or not. I'm not going to try it, but I often wonder how I'd be if I just stopped taking them. Realistically, probably not well-- but I've taken them for so long I don't really remember life without medication.

It just kind of astounds me that depression is something that some people can just get over. A hiccup in the road, even if it lasts for a month or years. I just don't see my life without sadness in it. And I know even if I wasn't mentally ill I'd get sad; everyone does and I know that, but it feels like, for me at least, like my brain's just sorta marinated in it for so long that the stain will never disappear.

Like you can dump coffee on a white shirt and most of the time it'll come out-- maybe a small stain, but it's unnoticeable unless you examine it closely. I think it's like even in the womb I was soaked in coffee for so long there is quite literally no chance of coming out with a clean shirt. Maybe a stupid metaphor, but I hope it gets the imagery across.

I'm leagues over where I used to be and I don't think about dying that much anymore, but it's always there even if I can't see it. It feels like an out. Like an escape. I'm doing things, I'm trying things-- all to plan for a future for myself that I can't visualize. And if it doesn't work out, I know I'll either hoist myself up and keep going, even if it takes agonizingly longer than everyone else; or find a way to get away from this world.

All of my family-- on both sides-- have some kind of mental illness. I'm sure a lot of families do, but a lot of people aren't diagnosed. I love my parents, and I'm lucky enough to say that. But sometimes I wonder how it'd be if they didn't have similar (if not the same) issues that I do. And if I didn't have them, either. I don't know what would change, if anything at all.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

I’m already healthy and in shape but wanted to feel better. More energy and not need pre workout, etc. I felt amazing, no energy crashes, my abs were coming in, slept well, inflammation went down- I looked so slim and felt wonderful— I went to dinner for my birthday last night, still had a ribeye, oysters & allowed myself to have a glass of Pinot Grigio and roasted red potatoes. Which was the first carb other than honey that I had put in my coffee the day of. I had not introduced any carbs back into my system until this day.. I didn’t eat much that day just because I knew I might indulge. The day after, I have been feeling like crap. Sluggish, moody, terrible headache, just so bad. I didn’t even do the diet that long, and I’m just wondering, how do I recover from this? Does this set me back a lot more than I realize, and how do I balance one night a week allowing myself a drink.. like I said, I mainly do this diet for the cognitive and energy aspect, I don’t care to lose weight or anything.. any suggestions?

I must add— I figured since I did indulge it might be smart to fast until 1 pm so I did that and just ate meat for my first meal back. ",1,1731794124.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

She has started this behavior with my mom too, who has been watching her when I’m gone. 

Today I was even between her and my dad and I handed my dad my phone and she barked and lunched at him. She has not ever bitten him. 

I responded by reprimanding her in the moment. My dad was so upset he kicked the coffee table she was under. I know, it’s bad!

I’m worried this situation is becoming untenable. My dad also is afraid of dogs and while he tolerates her presence because he likes having me home, he is extremely upset about this.

I thought about paying for a trainer to come to the home to work with us. Any other ideas? Have the problem is he has negative vibes about her.

I will say she also tried growling at my mom and my mom just kinda reassured her and let her and now they are great.

1gsy0xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1gsy0xs/question_discouraging_experiences_at_omega/,[Question] Discouraging experiences at Omega,"This is my experience of shopping for yellow gold diver watches - specifically the Panerai Submersible and the Omega Seamaster.

First I walked into a Panerai boutique. The security gentleman opened the door for me and welcomed me in. Two gentlemen greeted me and immediately, introduced themselves, asked my name, offered a coffee (which was delicious) and brought a platter of Lindt chocolates. I sat down with an associate who had a very impressive knowledge of the products. I told him I was considering the Submersible or the Seamaster from Omega. He knew a lot about the Seamaster and was able to compare both watches for me with his own knowledge and extra information from the laptop. He showed me all the watches and accessories I was interested in. The whole time the security gentleman kept smiling and nodding when I looked his way. Towards the end the associate asked for my contact information, shook my hand, and I was sent a product information sheet and a bunch of comparisons between the watches I was interested in. I was blown away. I have never experienced such great customer service.

After that great experience I went to Omega.

I walked in to the first boutique, was greeted by an anonymous female associate who asked if I was interested in anything in particular. I told her I was interested in the Seamaster with a rubber strap. I asked if I could see it. She said *she would have to go grab it from the safe*, but showed me a different strap and color. I asked if a metal bracelet was available, to which she said *""I don't think I have it""*. Lastly, I asked if they remove scratches when I bring the watch for servicing, she said that it is not an option, they would only clean the case. I told her I was considering the Panerai Submersible also, to which she responded *""okay""*. At no point did she ask my name, my information, nothing. She did not try to convince me the Omega was better than the Panerai in any way. The interaction ended with *""is there anything else I can help you with today?""*, to which I replied no, thank you, and she smiled and walked away to another customer. The entire interaction occurred standing up in front of a glass cabinet.

Since I could not see what I was interested in, I decided to visit the second Omega boutique which was not far away.

The store was completely empty except a security gentleman who was on his phone. Not an associate to be found inside. The security gentleman at the door told me to walk around the store and see if I like anything. I told him I knew what I wanted to see and he cut me off mid-sentence and in a raised tone repeated *""****sir****, please look around""*. He called in an associate via radio and he arrived within a minute. I told the associate I was interested in the Seamaster and this time I was shown the watches I was interested in. I mentioned the Panerai Submersible, but the associate was unfamiliar. I showed pictures and told him about the watch just to highlight some features that the Omega may or may not have compared to the Panerai. He insisted that the Seamaster had luminous indices (which the Panerai does too, of course) and that the biggest advantage of the Seamaster is the coaxial movement. I am very familiar with the movement, however I still asked him what *coaxial* meant - he just said that *""it is unique to Omega""*. Ugh. Just like at the previous store, I asked if they remove scratches when I bring the watch for servicing, this time I got a yes - not sure what is true. At that point I told him about my experience at Panerai compared to Omega, to which he responded *""we usually offer beverages and gifts after you purchase""*. I ended up asking him his name. He never asked mine or my contact information. I felt less like an inconvenience compared to the first boutique, yet still far from great.

I don't want to commit to the Panerai based on the purchasing experience—I am paying for the watch after all, but I feel that Panerai *wants* me to have their watch, whereas Omega does not seem to care if i live or die. It hurts my heart that I had two negative experiences regarding the watch I initially liked more. I understand that Omega is very popular and will close sales no matter what, but I believe that potential buyers deserve more while expressly looking to buy an expensive watch.

I’m being tasked with re-furnishing my mother’s rent controlled apartment of 28 years basically from scratch. I don’t really have an eye for design or interior decorating and I’m a bit overwhelmed to be starting with a blank canvas. Figuring out placement for things, deciding the right color for things all feels overwhelming. 

I know the carpets are terrible, but unfortunately her landlord is refusing to replace them on their dime.  I can’t afford to replace them so I’m stuck and will have a professional carpet cleaner coming next week. 
I want to utilize rugs in all the rooms to try to cover it up. The landlord is also refusing to repaint on their dime or allow me to do so myself or hire a handyman, so I’m stuck with them for now. There is a clause in the lease that I’m not able to alter the unit, so changes to the foundation aren’t easy to do. 

My general idea so far is: 

Living room (228.48 square ft) would contain a sofa with chaise, coffee table, 2 end tables, a tv stand with tv, a corner desk, a shoe rack, and a book shelf. She has different framed pictures I’d like to put on the walls. I want to put up curtains. The space next to the living room (where all that stuff is) is the kitchen. I’m thinking of getting a small 4 person dining table, and a small bar cart. 

Balcony: I just bought that patio set outside, my only other plan was buying a plant stand. 

Bedroom 1 (105.56 square ft): I’d like to get my mom a queen bed since that’s what she had before, 1 or 2 night stands depending on fit, a dresser to use as a tv stand and maybe a standing mirror. I want to put up curtains.

We'll lock eyes all the time. In a group we are always staring at eachother. It doesn't matter what we're doing, we're always staring at one another it's like magnets, if shes walking through the corridor or she sees me through the glass in the door or if shes on the opposite side of the room, its like i know she's watching me and i always see her already grinning right at me

I take pics of her all the time and she demands to take selfies all the time etc. She hates pics. She also had a photo of me saved on her phone from when i was drunk and fell over. We mentioned this event to a coworker and she got the photo up right away..? She has videos of me and pics of me interacting with her kids saved too. 

She calls me bestie. She uses this term 80% to refer to people who are dating. Rarely it means friend.  She makes everyone well aware of the fact that i am her bestie. Someone bought me chocolate and she said 'She's trying to be besties with you...' and has referred to another lesbian coworker and her literal wife as 'Besties'

She will text me all the time and sends selfies of her and her kids, or just her. When she gets her nails done she will send me a pic to see if I like them. Ill text her to bring me food if im alone on shift (jokingly) and she will be cheeky and say 'nope you can get it yourself etc'  and she will send me winky faces sometimes

She brings me coffee from the coffee machine and always makes me come with her for random shit and she will come chat in my office too. She will stand way too close to me and i find our eyes just drawn to each other for extended periods of time. 

Our colleages notice were always together, and they say she likes me but doesn't realise she's gay yet. She keeps teasing me that we can't talk to eachother and that because of the sexual harassment training 'besties' aren't allowed. 

I  told her i watched a film where an actress from her country plays a lesbian and she said 'Oh so you were watching a movie and thinking of me?'

We had sexual harassment training and I called one of the characters on the video Mr Flirty. She said that Mr Flirty is me. She explained sexual harassment  to another colleague by saying 'When someone comes and talks to you all the time and is always annoying you like this one, if you don't want it then you report it'

walking to our seat, i noticed a group of about 8 older ladies laughing and sharing a good time over breakfast. did they just get done with something (a knitting circle maybe)? do they meet here every saturday because they're old high school pals? book club ladies? i dont know, but they were sweet. 

across from our table was a single older gentleman, 60's maybe, reading a book enjoying coffee and breakfast. as a little time passed, an employee brought him a tall soda. he thanked her politely. more time passes and the gentlman has a lady join him. with a giant smile on his face, he says, ""hi"" and makes room for her at his table. 

i watch more patrons come and go, all with different stories, that i've made up of course....a guy in construction gear probably on his way to work, a small older man out to get some food because his wife is out of town, a mom looking woman and a younger girl out for a treat on a saturday morning.

Do you think our cultures will match? Of course there will be differences, but do you think it will be significant? I don't really think so, my boyfriend's family is kinda secular and I also live a secular life. For example, I don't wear hijab. But still any advices?

I heard that in some Turkish families, few relatives will comment about a foreigner -just like in Egyptian families lol- Is this a problem that I need to clarify? In many countries, Egyptians are seen as conservative and religious people and it's mostly true, but will people come to me with it when I tell them I'm Egyptian? As I said, I'm not a religious person.

How do Turkish families look at couple interactions? I sit together, hug and kiss my boyfriend but if I do such things in front of my family in Egypt it will be a bit problematic. Does the same apply for Turkish families?

It's hard enough not to want to shake them and wake them up on a good day. I don't think I have the energy or tolerance for it right now. I'm seriously guarding access to me as I learn to navigate this new society. 

My husband is aware of my discomfort when visiting. Two years ago, I started staying home and letting him make the 4 hour drive to see them by himself. I would only go for a big holiday or milestone. Even then it's difficult. I often run to the store because I forgot something and then get lost or the store didn't have it in stock so I'm going to find it at another store. It's exhausting.

I'm going to break his heart when I tell him I'm not going for the holidays. I just can't. ",5,1731793059.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

1gsxneu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gsxneu/aita_for_going_no_contact_with_my_father/,Aita for going no contact with my father?,"9 months ago I gave birth to my first baby. I tried calling my father to tell him the news but he never answered the phone and I later found out he had practically been living like a homeless. He had no phone, lives in a cabin he build himself in the middle of nowhere and doesn’t have a job. I won’t go into details as it would be too long of a story, but he’s never been a caring or present father and in all honesty never cared every much for me or my sister while he was married to my mum, and we seemed to grow even more apart after they got divorced and I moved with my mum and sister abroad. I’d call him whenever I had the chance but the calls were always very short and we never had much to talk about and he never sounded interested in anything I had to say. With time I started calling less and less until we were on one call a week. Obviously since he wasn’t telling us anything about his life there was no way me and my sister could know that his life had been deteriorating until one of his sisters (who I don’t happen to be very close with) reached out and told me how he had quit his job and what his situation really was. When I confronted him he said he was happy living like that and gave me a ridiculous story that he is living in the middle of nature and he likes it. With him not having access to electricity where he could charge a phone, contacting him became a challenge ever since. At the time I found out I was pregnant, I was told that he had got himself a phone which he’d charge in a coffee shop. I tried calling him to give him the news but he never answered. I even reached out to the owner of the coffee shop who let him charge his phone and asked him to tell my father to call me back or at least answer my calls as I had news I wanted to share with him. I never received a call back nor did he answer any of my calls. I found out someone told him the news that he was going to be a grandfather but he didn’t look like he cared at all which broke my heart. Needless to say he never congratulated me or tried to find out out how my pregnancy was going. My whole pregnancy I didn’t hear from him. So now, I have a 9 month old baby which my dad has never met. I found out he has been asking around when am I coming on holiday as he wants to meet his “grandson” (whose name he doesn’t even know) despite never caring about me or the baby when I was pregnant. But after all that he’s done, now it’s me who doesn’t want him to meet my baby as I don’t think he deserves it based on his lack of interest for my baby or myself.
People who know him are suddenly reaching out to me saying I should help him that he’s homeless but I don’t really want to reach out anymore and have reached a point that for my own sanity I had to distance myself from him. People tell me I should swallow my pride and that despite all he’s my dad but the way I see it respect should go both ways and doesn’t matter who you are and if you don’t try to be in my life then I don’t want or need you there anyways.
So, aita for going no contact with my father?

My doctor was ok with these numbers. In August, I had a bit of an eye opening experience through an employee sponsored screening, made some major changes and 3 months later my numbers are better than they have ever been:

8/6/24: TC 231; LDL 149

11/16/24: TC 170; LDL 97

I owe all to this subreddit with a ton of knowledge gained about how diet can affect my numbers.

Here's what I did:

-Tracked food consumption with a scale and Cronometer app

-Goal saturated fat/day <10 g

-Basically no dairy: Avocado or olive oil in place of butter, no milk, no cheese, no ice cream, no snacks with cheese (looking at you, Cheez-its!)

-Cheerios!

-Chicken and turkey in place of beef and pork

-More fiber: lots of raspberries, apples, whole wheat bread with jam

-READ THE LABELS! So much stuff has a TON of saturated fat that you wouldn't even realize without looking and a 
""serving"" is much smaller than you may realize

-Increased fish intake with tinned fish mostly on days with otherwise low saturated fat intake

-No more chocolate-based candy, no more cookies

-No change in alcohol consumption

-Switched to filtered coffee from French press

-A few ""cheats"" if I was on vacation or went out to eat but still looked for chicken or fish at restaurants

Some foods that I've discovered I enjoy:
Peanut butter powder
Chickpea puffs (Hippeas)
Dried chickpeas
Hummus
Whole wheat, whole grain breads

We have ss14 full time for 12 years now.  He sees his mom EOW. We have always tried to instill responsibility in him -keeping room clean, laundry, making at “least basic food for himself for breakfast & lunch. He also takes daily meds. BUT I continue to have to follow him around every single day to micromanage - “did you take your meds?” “did you brush your teeth? Shower? Eat lunch? “. I can’t ignore certain things like not brushing teeth, because we pay for braces & they’re expensive quite frankly. Same with the meds as they’re important.

Will ask us to go grab dinner, (i cook a few times per week but they’re old enough to meet their own needs when i don’t). Asks my husband to prepare coffee daily before  work, much more.

Sd works and makes “good money” but doesn’t buy groceries or pay bills. That’s fine but she can pay for her own fast food or Uber eats if she wants, as that’s a luxury. There is ALWAYS food in the fridge and freezer, it just requires them to actually prepare it. She also acts weird when husband and I go relax in our bedroom… like you guys are old enough to entertain yourselves, I’m not sure what they’re expecting. Ss is used to entertaining himself as he has his gaming system, and we go on family walks together, still eat dinner together… I’m just dreading myself becoming more pregnant and then still being so incredibly helpless.

# Welcome to your new Mod Free Origins SMP

We are are a Minecraft SMP Origins Server for 1.20-1.21 with custom tailored plugins that promotes a crossplay experience for both java and bedrock players without the need to install any mods. With heavy inspiration from the original Origins mod, we are inspired from the original mod  with additional new twist for the origins such as a Blazeborn's new heat gauge mechanic or Shulk capability to levitate enemies on hit.

We promote a friendly nontoxic environment and focus development to promote player to player interactions to create memorable experiences. We do not allow griefing, stealing, or harassment. We do offer a supporter rank for those wanting to show appreciation but only provide small QOL changes to avoid P2W advantages and to keep the server fair to all.

# Why Play Origins Reborn?

We offer a unique Towny experience via custom plugin integration to encourage both roleplay and teamwork within a low inflation player driven economy. Towns are encouraged to be a center point of activity for both town members and guests with new mechanics such as the Tavern and Market systems.

[New Potions & Unique Items can be made to enhance the vanilla experience](https://preview.redd.it/2743wr0yyarc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee0ad67937cffe2b168e4a58bf212461db27a52)

Enhance the vanilla experience with the famous Brewery Plugin with over 20 new drinks ranging from brews, coffees, teas, liquid orbs of origin, and more.  New coinvent recipes have been added to allow megabuild  projects to be more obtainable. We plan to continue to add more Quality of life changes over time.

[Players can choose to engage in an optional a high risk\/ high reward bounty system](https://preview.redd.it/ai0w71gyyarc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=db0e5ffb03bf28a504c57e0c3c1b49367baf74dc)

While PVP is not the primary focus of the server, players may join an optional PVP bounty system. The bounty system allows players to receive bounties and hunt others for monetary reward, but at the risk of losing some yourself.  Opted out players have defenses to discourage unwanted PVP.

[Everyone is welcome!](https://preview.redd.it/80lgf26dxdcd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51b98400f50494f3ebb49811db3ccacc655bba9)

We strive to have compatibility for as many players as possible. This means anyone can join even without mods, and allow players from Mobile, Console, Bedrock PC, and Java to play. We do not support cracked clients though, so you would need access to a Minecraft account

# Welcome to your new Mod Free Origins SMP

We are are a Minecraft SMP Origins Server for 1.20-1.21 with custom tailored plugins that promotes a crossplay experience for both java and bedrock players without the need to install any mods. With heavy inspiration from the original Origins mod, we are inspired from the original mod  with additional new twist for the origins such as a Blazeborn's new heat gauge mechanic or Shulk capability to levitate enemies on hit.

We promote a friendly nontoxic environment and focus development to promote player to player interactions to create memorable experiences. We do not allow griefing, stealing, or harassment. We do offer a supporter rank for those wanting to show appreciation but only provide small QOL changes to avoid P2W advantages and to keep the server fair to all.

# Why Play Origins Reborn?

[Custom Towny Integration & Player Economy causes towns to become a source of memorable experiences](https://preview.redd.it/w804v9xwyarc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0e77ada362137f102c49c2577f1c930fa35167)

We offer a unique Towny experience via custom plugin integration to encourage both roleplay and teamwork within a low inflation player driven economy. Towns are encouraged to be a center point of activity for both town members and guests with new mechanics such as the Tavern and Market systems.

[New Potions & Unique Items can be made to enhance the vanilla experience](https://preview.redd.it/2743wr0yyarc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee0ad67937cffe2b168e4a58bf212461db27a52)

Enhance the vanilla experience with the famous Brewery Plugin with over 20 new drinks ranging from brews, coffees, teas, liquid orbs of origin, and more.  New coinvent recipes have been added to allow megabuild  projects to be more obtainable. We plan to continue to add more Quality of life changes over time.

[Players can choose to engage in an optional a high risk\/ high reward bounty system](https://preview.redd.it/ai0w71gyyarc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=db0e5ffb03bf28a504c57e0c3c1b49367baf74dc)

While PVP is not the primary focus of the server, players may join an optional PVP bounty system. The bounty system allows players to receive bounties and hunt others for monetary reward, but at the risk of losing some yourself.  Opted out players have defenses to discourage unwanted PVP.

[Everyone is welcome!](https://preview.redd.it/80lgf26dxdcd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51b98400f50494f3ebb49811db3ccacc655bba9)

We strive to have compatibility for as many players as possible. This means anyone can join even without mods, and allow players from Mobile, Console, Bedrock PC, and Java to play. We do not support cracked clients though, so you would need access to a Minecraft account

1gsxej1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gsxej1/aitah_for_not_wanting_family_to_stay_with_us/,AITAH for not wanting family to stay with us? ,"It’s been just a little over a week since my aunt and 2 cousins (5M & 8F) moved in with me and my family (3 of us in total). We rented out our guest room a couple months ago to another girl who just moved to the city so my small townhome currently houses 7 people + a large dog (dog is mine btw). 

My cousins have lived with us before for shorter periods of time, usually a few days but never more than 5, and it’s always whenever my uncle is wrecking havoc in their home. It’s a very touchy situation & I understand we’re all trying to handle it best we can while trying to get my uncle the help he desperately needs. But I truly feel like I am turning my back on my family in this moment when I wake up every day wanting them to leave. 

To preface: I have a complicated relationship with my uncle as well, his drinking and behaviour has gotten so much worse since my dad passed (he was also abusive and a drunk) but that makes it so much more difficult to help my uncle. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still trying to guide my aunt and help her see that even if he agrees to go to rehab again, she still needs to divorce him because now the kids are in danger. He slapped my little cousin a few days ago so that’s why their stay has been prolonged. 

I don’t want them to go back to their house (for obvious reasons), I just don’t want them to keep staying here. I want them to figure out wtf is going on asap because this truly isn’t a feasible living situation to me at all. I moved into the basement so there was more space for everyone upstairs, but because the house is smaller, built in the 70’s, and there’s 0 carpeting installed, noise travels like it’s no one’s business. Every morning all I hear is the kids stomping, borderline yelling, and whining about god knows what. All of us (me, my mom, and my sister) have explained to them nicely over and over and over again to walk normally and not stomp up the stairs while screaming and running because it’s extremely loud. On top of that, my dog is not used to having extra people in the house for this long. The noise is too much for him too, just this morning my cousin was yelled at because he kept poking at my dog when he was trying to nap. My dog isn’t reactive like lunging or anything, but he will bark nonstop if the daily routine is disrupted. No one in my family trained him except for me, and even though I continue to tell them exactly what to say and do to keep him calm, no one listens. Almost every morning since they moved in, I’ve had to wake up earlier and adjust my own routine because no one else is telling him to “be quiet” or letting him out in the yard or doing what he’s barking for. Example: I usually sit with him with my coffee in the living room for a bit around lunch time, he has started barking at my aunt and cousins because they keep walking in and out of the living room without doing anything or saying anything to my dog and all he wants is someone to sit there like how I do at that time while he chews on his bone. That’s just one example but extrapolate it as you wish to the rest of the day. 

I know my cousins are just kids, and I want to be there for them like how I wish someone was there for me when I was going through the exact same situation. I buy them food, I play with them, take them out with my dog to the park and on walks, on drives to distract them and show them pretty houses etc etc. I help around the house too, yesterday morning I cleaned all the floors so my aunt didn’t do it because I could tell she was stressed, overwhelmed, and needed to just rest to forget about reality for a second. 

As I’m writing this, my dog is lying next to me not uttering a peep and letting me eat and drink in silence. He does not do this when the kids rile him up and then sit down to eat because they never stay still. They’re constantly getting up and moving around, running to my dog trying to play with them, then they get yelled at for not sitting properly to finish eating their food, my dog keeps barking because he thought he was going to play or go outside, and then no one does anything until I come to the main floor. Cycle repeats. 

My mom is frustrated because she wants her bedroom back instead of sharing it with 3 other people, and I want the peaceful house that I finally had back. I am MORE THAN HAPPY to figure out what to do with my uncle and also figure out logistics so my aunt can move out of their home (and out of ours) and be safe. They’re my family, I care about them and love them a lot even if they frustrate me, but I feel like a douchebag wanting them out of my house in this situation. Tensions between my mom and aunt have basically turned this whole thing into a huge waiting game and I don’t have time for that. I have school, work, and other responsibilities so it’s either I compromise a little across the board so I can help around the house even more + be there for my dog more when everyone is around him, or I continue to live my life while feeling immense guilt that everyone is probably at home with constant noise (kids and dog) and an overall frustrating living situation. 

I tried to talk about this with my mom and was basically told that we will find out on Monday what is happening. If my aunt and cousins move back with my uncle in a couple days I will be more pissed off because what was the point of any of this. That’s a different conversation I guess but still. 

AITAH for wanting them to move out? <- need to reiterate I don’t want them going back to my uncle. 

TLDR: aunt and two little cousins living in my home (total is 7 people + dog). small townhouse is overwhelming- constant noise and disruption, 0 privacy. Don’t want them back with my abusive uncle, just don’t want them to keep staying here. It’s been almost 1.5 weeks. 

Edit: typo, and to add on: I have been in the process of healing from my own DV trauma that lasted for 10 years. I’m extremely proud of how far I’ve come with navigating all sorts of grief and for staying alive through it all. I did turn to weed & nic to cope, I will not deny that. But a couple months ago I quit and went strong for almost 2 months without vaping. I am not proud of starting it again but I did buy a weed vape and a nic vape a few days ago. Essentially when I found out he raised his hand on my cousin. I have a therapy session booked (earliest is in a few weeks) and I’m still making time to be there for myself and to not fall down the rabbit hole of triggers that will put me back into the dark headspace I used to be in. I do not have the heart to constantly be parenting my cousins or to yell at them after I tell them the same thing over and over and they still won’t listen. I know why they won’t listen, and it isn’t their fault. They can’t regulate their emotions properly or communicate because of the fear that was instilled by my uncle, I get that. But I cannot keep going in circles with gentle parenting them both, then training and reinforcing the behaviours in my dog to adjust to this living situation, and still be A-okay and positive and smiley. I have my own stress, I feel like I’m basically preparing for my uncle to meet the same fate my dad did, and on top of that I have midterm exams? .. ",1,1731792273.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

My current kettle is 3000w and is boiled multiple times daily which can cost quite a bit so I’m wondering if a new keep warm kettle would help save some money? (And time waiting for it to boil).

Zoloft 
Sertraline 
They all give me some kind of drowsiness and sleepiness effect with emtional bluntness. 

The last one I took was Effexor- the biggest problem with that one was the apathy and emotional bluntness. 

So far I have been feeling quite exhausted everyday (might be because of the tapering off of Effexor)

Can I exercise in the first few weeks?

(And A league Arcane Prompt (Spoiler free) )","Good morning/Evening to everyone reading the post! I would first like to Introduce myself! 

I am a 21yr Male who has been roleplaying for almost 4-5 years now. I Almost always roleplay Slow burn romances. Ill gladly tell you more about myself in privacy! 

Now onto the prompts!! Its a lot, So To sum it up. 1 is a Fantasy Romance, 2 is a romance based off arcane, and the last ones are just some basic SOL roleplays I enjoy doing!

**1. The Library's secret**  
The story unfolds in an ancient, sprawling library located in the heart of a quiet, forgotten town. The library is known among scholars and adventurers as a place of legend, rumored to contain knowledge that can change lives—or even the world. The walls are lined with towering shelves filled with books, scrolls, and artifacts from forgotten eras. Hidden staircases and locked doors suggest secrets waiting to be uncovered, but few dare to search too deeply, fearing the library's mysterious reputation.

My OC:/Your OC: A reclusive librarian. They’ve worked at the library for years and have an intimate knowledge of its layout, quirks, and mysteries. They are deeply protective of the library and its secrets, seeing it as a sanctuary.

Second OC: A visitor seeking answers. Perhaps they’re a scholar chasing forbidden knowledge, an adventurer on the run, or someone searching for a way to heal from a personal loss. They Are drawn to the library and to the librarian who seems to know more than they let on.

While exploring the library, Second OC stumbles upon a hidden section or an artifact that only reveals itself to those in desperate need. The discovery peaks First OC curiosity, as they’ve never seen this part of the library manifest before. Intrigued, they agree to help Character B decipher its meaning...  


I'm going to stop it there, Mainly because I want this story to Unravel differently with each different person. We can figure out where this one goes after!

  
**2.Arcane Based roleplay**  
Before I give out my idea, I will gladly play as (almost) any Canon character in a plot. So if you don't like this one We can happily make one ourselves (spoiler free if you want to base it off the first Season! If not, we can work with one of the newer episodes \*\**Including the ones that came out today*\*\*).

My OC(Preferably, but willing to play the other role): A resourceful and high ranking scavenger and smuggler with ties to an emerging rebellion. They’ve seen firsthand the harm caused by the Uppercity’s experiments on their people and have dedicated their life to survival and, revenge. Though distrustful, they harbor a secret soft side, yearning for something or someone to believe in.  


Other OC(Just a premise for this one, Basically a example of what mine would be.):A brilliant but morally torn inventor working for one of the ruling houses. They’ve been tasked with developing new technology to “maintain order” in the Undercity but are increasingly uneasy about the ethics of their work. They grew up in privilege, always seeking to make their mark in a world where achievement is everything. Their hidden vulnerability is their desire to belong. 

Sample, Prompt: Pilty Character sneaks into the Undercity to see the effects of their work firsthand and is attacked by rebels. Zaun OC saves them, either out of strategy (an Pilty hostage is valuable) or a fleeting sense of mercy. This begins a tense, reluctant partnership... We can figure out where it goes from there.

3-4: Some basic Sol Roleplays!

***SOL prompts: Caretaker***  
My oc (or yours) have been friends for years, Sadly one of us got in a really bad car crash, Ending up in a coma for a few weeks. Worried sick about the other they where bedside every day. One night, they received a call, It was the others mother. They had awoken...(ill let what plays out at the hospital)

They have taken up the responsibility of helping the other with the lower mobility, and daily life. Will feelings arise?

More notes!: This is a very basic prompt, Mainly cause its very basic... No more elaboration.

***The Charming Cafe***: A charming café located in the heart of a vibrant urban neighborhood, surrounded by eclectic shops, art galleries, and street musicians. The café has a cozy atmosphere, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of soft jazz music.  
My Oc(or yours!) would be a barista at the café, known for their exceptional coffee-making skills and warm smile. They take pride in creating a welcoming space for customers but often keep their personal life private.  
The Other perhaps a Familiar face, A visible face on a busy day in the cafe. Lets figure the rest of this together!

**Unexpected Roommates**: Due to a mix-up, two strangers end up sharing an apartment. Their initially awkward cohabitation turns into a comfortable companionship and eventually, love. (much smaller one)  
we can gladly figure this one out together!

I've '36 F' been seeing this guy 'M37' for around 3 months now and for the most part, things have been going well. However we only see one another of an evening and it's been approximately 21 times we've spent together. But I've always found it a bit off- like how we only get intimate in bed, even kissing. 
But I've put that down to it just being different then anything I've had before and so kept going.

Anyway, for context he has 2 teenagers from a previous marriage. And so this one night, It was his turn to have them. As it happened, I promised my friends I'd finally go see their open mic at the pub. My friends are the guys I train with, and I've known them for well over 14 years. They are also much older but we get on. I was honest and told my bf what I was up to and he got really weird about it, which has since caused an argument/impasse. 
So, his boundary that he stands firmly on is that he doesn't want me seeing any guy/guys in the context of drinking alcohol.  Like ever. But coffee is fine. 
It's not that he doesn't trust me, he says but he doesn't trust men. 
I've offered for him to join but he's even stated that he'd still stand firm on his boundary. 

Just for some context too, I have always been a tomboy and got on better with men than women, so I have many more male friends and through the gym too. 

We had a chat about it, and he keeps bringing it up every few minutes, but then also says ""it's not you, you're an adult, you can do what you like etc "" but not that. 

Then after that night at the pub, we were meant to see each other, but i was emotionally tired and just tired, with work the next morning an early start too so I told him I'd rather have some time to myself and that I'm tired. 
He told me I was taking the piss, and that I can go out the night before and see a friend for coffee the next morning but then cancel on him. 
Now he's bringing it up every minute despite trying to talk it out. 
I think this is a bad sign and I got blamed for things in my last relationship that I never did or got exaggerated, so I'm thinking I'm so done. He's clearly got past trauma but projecting it onto me in a black and white fashion. I feel like I'm being put into a box. I've tried to compromise but he won't have it. And now being blamed, and not being able to let even a small thing go, is it better to just leave?

##edited - he also states his boundary that he himself won't drink with women, not even one, so the girl hes seeing shouldnt drink (even one) with men/man. But that does make me feel like he doesn't trust himself either 

I just need to know if this is a red flag and to get out or continue please? 

TLDR- my boyfriend of 3 months has this  make or break boundary that he wants to impose on me but I think it's unfair, we fought and now I'm thinking if i should leave. ",3,1731791686.0,relationship_advice,17,0.8,False
1gsx61s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Le_chill_subreddit/comments/1gsx61s/the_ravine_short_story_by_graham_salisbury/,“The Ravine” Short Story by Graham Salisbury,"**Graham Salisbury** (b. 1944) *was born in Pennsylvania but grew up in Hawaiʻi. Growing up with a distant mother and without a father, who was killed in World War II, Salisbury lacked guidance. His characters explore choices similar to those he faced—making and keeping friends and learning honesty and courage. Their struggles, like Salisbury’s, also take place in a Hawaiian setting. Among his many writing awards are the Boston Globe/Horn Book award and a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year award.*

**SETTING A PURPOSE:** As you read, pay attention to how a tragic event affects Vinny. Write down any questions you have while reading.

When Vinny and three others dropped down into the ravine, they entered a jungle thick with tangled trees and rumors of what might have happened to the dead boy’s body.

The muddy trail was slick and, in places where it had fallen away, flat-out dangerous. The cool breeze that swept the Hawaiian hillside pastures above died early in the descent.

There were four of them—Vinny; his best friend, Joe-Boy; Mo, who was afraid of nothing; and Joe-Boy’s haole girlfriend, Starlene—all fifteen. It was a Tuesday in July, two weeks and a day after the boy had drowned. If, in fact, that’s what had happened to him.

Vinny slipped, and dropped his towel in the mud. He picked it up and tried to brush it off, but instead smeared the mud spot around until the towel resembled something someone’s dog had slept on. “Tst,” he said.

Joe-Boy, hiking down just behind him, laughed. “Hey, Vinny, just think, that kid walked where you walking.”

“Shuddup,” Vinny said.

“You prob’ly stepping right where his foot was.”

Vinny moved to the edge of the trail, where the ravine fell through a twisted jungle of gnarly trees and underbrush to the stream far below. He could see Starlene and Mo farther ahead, their heads bobbing as they walked, both almost down to the pond where the boy had died.

“Hey,” Joe-Boy went on, “maybe you going be the one to find his body.”

“You don’t cut it out, Joe-Boy, I going… I going…”

“What, cry?”

Vinny scowled. Sometimes Joe-Boy was a big fat babooze.

They slid down the trail. Mud oozed between Vinny’s toes. He grabbed at roots and branches to keep from falling. Mo and Starlene were out of sight now, the trail ahead having cut back.

Joe-Boy said, “You going jump in the water and go down and your hand going touch his face, stuck under the rocks. *Ha ha ha … a ha ha ha*!”

Vinny winced. He didn’t want to be here. It was too soon, way too soon. Two weeks and one day.

He saw a footprint in the mud and stepped around it.

The dead boy had jumped and had never come back up. Four search and rescue divers hunted for two days straight and never found him. Not a trace. Gave Vinny the creeps. It didn’t make sense. The pond wasn’t that big.

He wondered why it didn’t seem to bother anyone else. Maybe it did and they just didn’t want to say

Butchie was the kid’s name. Only fourteen. Fourteen.

Two weeks and one day ago he was walking down this trail. Now nobody could find him.

The jungle crushed in, reaching over the trail, and Vinny brushed leafy branches aside. The roar of the waterfall got louder, louder.

Starlene said it was the goddess that took him, the one that lives in the stone down by the road. She did that every now and then, Starlene said, took somebody when she got lonely. Took him and kept him. Vinny had heard that legend before, but he’d never believed in it.

Now he didn’t know what he believed.

The body had to be stuck down there. But still, four divers and they couldn’t find it?

Vinny decided he’d better believe in the legend. If he didn’t, the goddess might get mad and send him bad luck. Or maybe take *him*, too.

*Stopstopstop! Don’t think like that.*

“Come on,” Joe-Boy said, nudging Vinny from behind. “Hurry it up.”

Just then Starlene whooped, her voice bouncing around the walls of the ravine.

“Let’s *go*,” Joe-Boy said. “They there already.”

Moments later, Vinny jumped up onto a large boulder at the edge of the pond. Starlene was swimming out in the brown water. It wasn’t murky brown, but clean and clear to a depth of maybe three or four feet. Because of the waterfall you had to yell if you wanted to say something. The whole place smelled of mud and ginger and iron.

Starlene swam across to the waterfall on the far side of the pond and ducked under it, then climbed out and edged along the rock wall behind it, moving slowly, like a spider. Above, sun-sparkling stream water spilled over the lip of a one-hundred-foot drop.

Mo and Joe-Boy threw their towels onto the rocks and dove into the pond. Vinny watched; his muddy towel hooked around his neck. Reluctantly, he let it fall, then dove in after them.

The cold mountain water tasted tangy. Was it because the boy’s body was down there decomposing? He spit it out.

He followed Joe-Boy and Mo to the waterfall and ducked under it. They climbed up onto the rock ledge, just as Starlene had done, then spidered their way over to where you could climb to a small ledge about fifteen feet up. They took their time because the hand and footholds were slimy with moss.

Starlene jumped first. Her shriek echoed off the rocky cliff, then died in the dense green jungle.

Mo jumped, then Joe-Boy, then Vinny.

The fifteen-foot ledge was not the problem.

It was the one above it, the one you had to work up to, the big one, where you had to take a deadly zigzag trail that climbed up and away from the waterfall, then cut back and forth to a foot-wide ledge something more like fifty feet up.

That was the problem. That was where the boy had jumped from.

Joe-Boy and Starlene swam out to the middle of the pond. Mo swam back under the waterfall and climbed once again to the fifteen-foot ledge.

Vinny started to swim out toward Joe-Boy but stopped when he saw Starlene put her arms around him. She kissed him. They sank under for a long time, then came back up, still kissing.

Vinny turned away and swam back over to the other side of the pond, where he’d first gotten in. His mother would kill him if she ever heard about where he’d come. After the boy drowned, or was taken by the goddess, or whatever happened to him, she said never to come to this pond again. Ever. It was off-limits. Permanently.

But not his dad. He said, “You fall off a horse, you get back on, right? Or else you going be scared of it all your life.”

His mother scoffed and waved him off. “Don’t listen to him, Vinny, listen to me. Don’t go there. That pond is haunted.” Which had made his dad laugh.

But Vinny promised he’d stay away.

But then Starlene and Joe-Boy said, “Come with us anyway. You let your mommy run your life, or what?”

And Vinny said, “But what if I get caught?”

And Joe-Boy said, “So?”

Vinny mashed his lips. He was so weak. Couldn’t even say no. But if he’d said, “I can’t go, my mother won’t like it,” they would have laughed him right off the island. No, he had to go. No choice.

So, he’d come along, and so far, it was fine. He’d even gone in the water. Everyone was happy. All he had to do now was wait it out and go home and hope his mother never heard about it.

When he looked up, Starlene was gone.

He glanced around the pond until he spotted her starting up the zigzag trail to the fifty-foot ledge. She was moving slowly, hanging on to roots and branches on the upside of the cliff. He couldn’t believe she was going there. He wanted to yell, *Hey, Starlene, that’s where he* died!

But she already knew that.

Mo jumped from the lower ledge, yelling, “Banzaiiii!” An explosion of coffee-colored water erupted when he hit.

Joe-Boy swam over to where Starlene had gotten out. He waved to Vinny, grinning like a fool, then followed Starlene up the zigzag trail.

Now Starlene was twenty-five, thirty feet up. Vinny watched her for a while, then lost sight of her when she slipped behind a wall of jungle that blocked his view. A few minutes later she popped back out, now almost at the top, where the trail ended, where there was nothing but mud and a few plants to grab on to if you slipped, plants that would rip right out of the ground, plants that wouldn’t stop you if you fell, nothing but your screams between you and the rocks below.

Vinny’s stomach tingled just watching her. He couldn’t imagine what it must feel like to be up there, especially if you were afraid of heights, like he was. *She has no fear,* Vinny thought, *no fear at all. Pleasepleaseplease, Starlene. I don’t want to see you die.*

Starlene crept forward, making her way to the end of the trail, where the small ledge was.

Joe-Boy popped out of the jungle behind her. He stopped, waiting for her to jump before going on.

Vinny held his breath.

Starlene, in her cutoff jeans and soaked T-shirt, stood perfectly still, her arms at her sides. Vinny suddenly felt like hugging her. Why, he couldn’t tell. *Starlene, please.*

She reached behind her and took a wide leaf from a plant, then eased down and scooped up a finger of mud. She made a brown cross on her forehead, then wiped her muddy fingers on her jeans.

She waited.

Was she thinking about the dead boy?

She stuck the stem end of the leaf in her mouth, leaving the rest of it to hang out. When she jumped, the leaf would flap up and cover her nose and keep water from rushing into it. An old island trick.

She jumped. Down, down.

Almost in slow motion, it seemed at first, then faster and faster. She fell feetfirst, arms flapping to keep balance so she wouldn’t land on her back, or stomach, which would probably almost kill her.

Just before she hit, she crossed her arms over her chest and vanished within a small explosion of rusty water.

Vinny stood, not breathing at all, praying.

Ten seconds. Twenty, thirty …

She came back up, laughing.

*She shouldn’t make fun that way,* Vinny thought. It was dangerous, disrespectful. It was asking for it.

Vinny looked up when he heard Joe-Boy shout, “Hey, Vinny, watch how a man does it! Look!”

Joe-Boy scooped up some muð and drew a stroke of lightning across his chest. When he jumped, he threw himself out, face and body parallel to the pond, his arms and legs spread out. *He’s crazy*, Vinny thought, *absolutely insane*. At the last second Joe-Boy folded into a ball and hit. *Ca-roomp*! He came up whooping and yelling, “*Wooo! So good*! Come on, Vinny, it’s hot!”

Vinny faked a laugh. He waved, shouting, “Naah, the water’s too cold!”

Now Mo was heading up the zigzag trail—Mo, who hardly ever said a word and would do anything anyone ever challenged him to do. *Come on, Mo, not you, too*.

Vinny knew then that he would have to jump.

Jump, or never live it down.

Mo jumped in the same way Joe-Boy had, man-style, splayed out in a suicide fall. He came up grinning.

Starlene and Joe-Boy turned toward Vinny.

Vinny got up and hiked around the edge of the pond, walking in the muddy shallows, looking at a school of small brown-backed fish near a ginger patch.

Maybe they’d forget about him.

Starlene torpedoed over, swimming underwater. Her body glittered in the small amount of sunlight that penetrated the trees around the rim of the ravine. When she came up, she broke the surface smoothly, gracefully, like a swan. Her blond hair sleeked back like river grass.

She smiled a sweet smile. “Joe-Boy says you’re afraid to jump. I didn’t believe him. He’s wrong, right?”

Vinny said quickly, “Of course he’s wrong. I just don’t want to, that’s all. The water’s cold.”

“Naah, it’s nice.”

Vinny looked away. On the other side of the pond Joe-Boy and Mo were on the cliff behind the waterfall.

“Joe-Boy says your mom told you not to come here. Is that true?”

Vinny nodded. “Yeah. Stupid, but she thinks it’s haunted.”

“She’s right.”

“What?”

“That boy didn’t die, Vinny. The stone goddess took him. He’s in a good place right now. He’s her prince.”

Vinny scowled. He couldn’t tell if Starlene was teasing him or if she really believed that. He said, “Yeah, prob’ly.”

“Are you going to jump, or is Joe-Boy right?”

“Joe-Boy’s an idiot. Sure I’m going to jump.”

Starlene grinned, staring at Vinny a little too long. “He is an idiot, isn’t he? But I love him.”

“Yeah, well…”

“Go to it, big boy. I’ll be watching.”

 Starlene sank down and swam out into the pond.

*Ca-ripes*.

Vinny ripped a hank of white ginger from the ginger patch and smelled it, and prayed he’d still be alive after the sun went down.

He took his time climbing the zigzag trail. When he got to the part where the jungle hid him from view, he stopped and smelled the ginger again. So sweet and alive it made Vinny wish for all he was worth that he was climbing out of the ravine right now, heading home.

But of course, there was no way he could do that.

Not before jumping.

He tossed the ginger onto the muddy trail and continued on. He slipped once or twice, maybe three times. He didn’t keep track. He was too numb now, too caught up in the insane thing he was about to do. He’d never been this far up the trail before. Once he’d tried to go all the way, but couldn’t. It made him dizzy.

When he stepped out and the jungle opened into a huge bowl where he could look down, way, way down, he could see their three heads in the water, heads with arms moving slowly to keep them afloat, and a few bright rays of sunlight pouring down onto them, and when he saw this, his stomach fluttered and rose. Something sour came up and he spit it out.

It made him wobble to look down. He closed his eyes. His whole body trembled. The trail was no wider than the length of his foot. And it was wet and muddy from little rivulets of water that bled from the side of the cliff.

The next few steps were the hardest he’d ever taken in his life. He tried not to look down, but he couldn’t help it. His gaze was drawn there. He struggled to push back an urge to fly, just jump off and fly. He could almost see himself spiraling down like a glider, or a bird, or a leaf.

His hands shook as if he were freezing. He wondered, *Had the dead boy felt this way?* Or had he felt brave, like Starlene or Joe-Boy, or Mo, who seemed to feel nothing.

Somebody from below shouted, but Vinny couldn’t make it out over the waterfall, roaring down just feet beyond the ledge where he would soon be standing, cascading past so close its mist dampened the air he breathed.

*The dead boy had just come to the ravine to have fun*, Vinny thought. Just a regular kid like himself, come to swim and be with his friends, then go home and eat macaroni and cheese and watch TV, maybe play with his dog or wander around after dark.

But he’d done none of that.

Where was he?

Inch by inch Vinny made it to the ledge. He stood, swaying slightly, the tips of his toes one small movement from the precipice.

Far below, Joe-Boy waved his arm back and forth. It was dreamy to see—back and forth, back and forth. He looked so small down there.

For a moment Vinny’s mind went blank, as if he were in some trance, some dream where he could so easily lean out and fall, and think or feel nothing.

A breeze picked up and moved the trees on the ridge-line, but not a breath of it reached the fifty-foot ledge.

Vinny thought he heard a voice, small and distant. Yes. Something inside him, a tiny voice pleading, *Don’t do it. Walk away. Just turn and go and walk back down*.

“… I can’t,” Vinny whispered.

*You can, you can, you can. Walk back down*.

Vinny waited.

And waited.

Joe-Boy yelled, then Starlene, both of them waving.

Then something very strange happened.

Vinny felt at peace. Completely and totally calm and at peace. He had not made up his mind about jumping. But something else inside him had.

Thoughts and feelings swarmed, stinging him: *Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!*

But deep inside, where the peace was, where his mind wasn’t, he would not jump. He would walk back down.

*No! No, no, no!*  
Vinny eased down and fingered up some mud and made a cross on his chest, big and bold. He grabbed a leaf, stuck it in his mouth. *Be calm, be calm. Don’t look down*.

After a long pause he spit the leaf out and rubbed the cross to a blur.

They walked out of the ravine in silence, Starlene, Joe-Boy, and Mo far ahead of him. They hadn’t said a word since he’d come down off the trail. He knew what they were thinking. He knew, he knew, he knew.

At the same time the peace was still there. He had no idea what it was. But he prayed it wouldn’t leave him now, prayed it wouldn’t go away, would never go away, because in there, in that place where the peace was, it didn’t matter what they thought.

Vinny emerged from the ravine into a brilliance that surprised him. Joe-Boy, Starlene, and Mo were now almost down to the road.

Vinny breathed deeply, and looked up and out over the island. He saw, from there, a land that rolled away like honey, easing down a descent of rich Kikuyu grass pasture-land, flowing from there over vast highlands of brown and green, then, finally, falling massively to the coast and flat blue sea.

He’d never seen anything like it.

Had it always been here? This view of the island?

He stared and stared, then sat, taking it in.

He’d never seen anything so beautiful in all his life.

**COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION**

With a small group, discuss how Vinny’s feelings and behavior are influenced by the boy’s tragic death. Refer to events in the story to support your ideas.

**Describe Stories: Character and Setting**

Like real people, characters have personalities, drive, and life-changing events. To describe characters in terms of how they appear in stories, you can use these terms:

* **Character traits** are the qualities shown by a character, such as physical traits (tall, brown eyes) or expressions of personality (kind, anxious).
* **Character motivation** is the reason or reasons a character acts, feels, or thinks in a certain way.
* **Character development** is how a character changes throughout a story.

Think about your impressions of the characters in “The Ravine.” What traits and motivations does Vinny exhibit throughout the story?

In a story like “The Ravine,” the setting is a key factor in the events of the story and how the characters react to it and each other. The **setting** is the time and place in which the action occurs. The time can be a particular time of day, season, year, or historical period. The place can be an outside location, a room, a building, or a country.

Setting can affect characters by influencing their values, beliefs, and emotions or by affecting the way they live and interact with other characters. What impact does the setting have on Vinny?

**Make Inferences**

Readers often make inferences to figure out something an author has not explained. An **inference** is a logical guess that is based on facts and one’s own knowledge and experience. To support your inference, you may need to **cite evidence**, or provide examples and quotations from the story. For example, you can make an inference about Vinny and Joe-Boy’s friendship.

|Evidence from the Story|My Own Knowledge|Inference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Joe-Boy is Vinny’s “best friend” and Joe-Boy teases Vinny about finding the body.|Sometimes friends tease each other in a friendly way, but this teasing does not seem kind.|They may be friends, but Joe-Boy is not especially nice to Vinny.|

**Analyzing the Text**

*Cite Text Evidence*, Support your responses with evidence from the text.

1. **Summarize:** Review percents 11.2–19.2. In your own words, describe what Vinny knows about the dead boy. Explain his thoughts and feelings about this past event.
2. **Draw Conclusions:** Review percents 20.9–29.5. What are some examples of language the author uses to describe the setting? Why is the setting important to the story?
3. **Cite Evidence:** Reread percents 32.4–39.0 and think about what the author wants us to understand about Vinny. What words would you use to describe Vinny’s character traits?
4. **Make Inferences:** Before jumping, the characters perform certain rituals. Reread percents 48.0–60.8 to review how they prepare to jump. What inferences can you make about the characters’ feelings and their reasons for these rituals?
5. **Analyze:** Consider Vinny’s feelings and actions throughout the story. How is Vinny different by the end of the story? How is he the same?
6. **Critique Review:** the story’s ending in lines 94.1–100.0 and examine the descriptions the author provides. Do you think the ending makes the story more powerful? Why or why not?

**PERFORMANCE TASK**

**Writing Activity: Informative Essay:** Write a two- or three-paragraph essay to compare and contrast the character traits of Vinny and Joe-Boy.

* Introduce your topic by briefly describing the characters and their relationship to each other.
* Next, tell about how their character traits are different. Use examples from the text to support your ideas.
* Then indicate the character traits that the boys share or that are similar. Include evidence from the text.",1,1731791619.0,Le_chill_subreddit,0,1.0,False

Throughout this conversation he's told me that I am a feminist and sinful because I'm not listening to him because ""God made women to be submissive to men."" That we must obey men and learn from them and that women cannot teach (themselves or others). He's said that I am obviously not a Christian because I want to do my ""worldly hobbies"" which I had mentioned my hobbies to be helping at missions organizations or ministries, making coffee, and being with my friends and family. 

I asked him why God would give me passions for things such as having a coffee shop that will help spread the gospel and help others if I was supposed to be a housewife and he said I wad following Satan and not God because I'm deceived. 

It's very strange and I've been told that he is smarter than me and that I'm arguing with him and need to prove it if I'm right (???). 

He continually refers to the verse in 1 Timothy that is Paul talking to the women of the church he was writing to. 

I have no idea why someone would continue to argue that they know Gods plan for me over God. I said I follow Gods plan for me and obey God over a man on Reddit and he continues to argue with me about how I'm a feminist.

I met this guy on fb dating. Tall dark and handsome 29 (m) Abe. Is active military. Very smart and so he had said was dating for marriage, aka made it very clear from day one he was wanting a serious relationship. I also made it very clear on my fb dating I was only wanting serious relationships/conversations. I’m not into hook up culture. Just not my thing. After talking for a week or so we met for coffee near my house and hit it off. He was asking for my ring size and when we could go engagement shopping by the end of the date and finished it with a kiss. Very cute. Was smitten but still wary since I wasn’t born yesterday and know men love spewing bs. He had asked me to be his gf after this first date.

After that small date we made plans for him to visit me at my home and I would cook for him. Mind you, this is after continuous txtn and FT throughout the weeks. Staying consistent. Asking probing questions about love and family and partnership. 

So Abe comes over and eats my food. Watched tubi movies. All very cute. The only red flag I can say was obvious to me, was Abe asking and then suggesting I read 48 laws of power. Whenever I hear a man has read this book I assume they are a narcissist.. read the book. You’ll know why. But I brushed that off because he was sooooo sweet and gentle and was all about me and wanting me. Calling me perfect and beautiful every chance he got. 

So fast forward I’ve cooked for him about 4 times. He had asked before he came over to make a movie. I agreed. Again because I thought this man would be my husband. And the last time we had fooled around and one thing he had not talked about was if I was on bc. I am not. It messes with my body. So when he had finished inside me I said well that’s something we never talked about and giggled. I was nervous. I didn’t know why he did that and why he hadn’t spoken about it before just doing it. But no big deal to me cause I believed him when he said he wanted a life with me. That was a Monday and by that Thursday after not talking to me since Monday he txtn me Thursday night saying him and his father had gotten into a bad wreck and were in the hospital. 

I felt horrible for being upset he hadn’t txt or called me all week. But sent him well wishes and let him know id come to him if needed. He stopped replaying. Still has never replied. Just when ghost. 

Fast forward a month. I miss my period and find out I’m pregnant. The whole month I was still txtn and calling Abe every other day or so sending him well wishes and letting him know I’m praying for him and his father. But once I found out I was pregnant I kind of freaked out. I had no other way than his phone number to contact him. I couldn’t find him on fb dating anymore. Found his fb. Sent a message letting him know and was assuming he was just busy or hurt or something on why he ghost me but being pregnant I assumed would cancel out anything else going on. I thought I was dealing with a stand up military man. Clearly I was not. 

Abe didn’t but mostly likely knows now. My brother, I dnt speak about my family unless I’m close with said person, is in the military. Out ranking Abe by a lot. So I told my brother. And apparently Abe isn’t his real name and had already transferred outta state. “Abe” has blocked me and my family on fb. Hasn’t blocked my number but I’m assuming he changed it or something. But regardless he can’t run from the US gov so I got him there. 

I want my baby. I hate I’ve waited this long and end up with this monster as the father, but I’ve wanted to be a mom since forever. I hate myself for wanting this baby since I’ll be doing it alone but I do want my baby. 

I want to know if I’m the AH for throwing my brother at him? And am I the AH for wanting this baby? Is it hormones? I feel violated by this whole thing. I’ve been lied to and abandoned and would like to know if it’s worth it? I’m heartbroken by the situation but “Abe” didn’t break my heart just hurt my feelings and I’ve always preached about not having kids before marriage but I can’t get myself to not want this baby.

1gsx0n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/comments/1gsx0n3/nonus_is_my_attorney_flirting_with_me/,[non-US] Is my attorney flirting with me?,"I’m sure you all see one million of these questions, but I’m asking anyway.

I’m wrapping up a dispute (hearing was scheduled, but we settled) and my attorney has been absolutely incredible. They’re absolutely brilliant, their English is impeccable (I’m in a country where I don’t speak the language, but many people here speak fluent English), and I was insanely attracted to them from the moment we met in person.

I know I feel comfortable around them in part because they’re an incredible attorney who did a remarkable job with my dispute, but I think there’s more there. We had a working lunch the other day (which they suggested — is that typical?), and I so enjoyed their company as we worked but particularly as we just chatted while eating. They tried to pay, but I did (because I felt that was appropriate as the client). Spending time one-on-one with them outside of their office was genuinely wonderful. I really feel like we’re testing the waters with one another now that the ink is drying on the official documents. I know I’ll see them in the new year because we discovered we would be at the same public event — but, the event is ages away and I am impatient!

I *think* things are starting to get a little flirtatious, but perhaps they’re just a nice person and I’m projecting something onto them that just isn’t there. I’m in town for quite a while for work, so this could actually turn into something if my instincts are right. Said another way, I’m not just looking for a hook-up; beyond the attraction I feel, I’m genuinely curious to learn more about them, and I think we would actually enjoy spending time together even as friends.

What do I do? I don’t mind getting rejected, but don’t want to make them feel awkward or conflicted in any way. Perhaps an attorney here in this subreddit can advise if they’ve reached out to a client for a date after that person is no longer a client? Or does one typically wait to see if the former client is interested? Would it be crazy to see if they wanted to have coffee together once they are no longer representing me, or is it better to take a beat and see what they do?",0,1731791202.0,AskLawyers,2,0.33,False

1gsx01x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1gsx01x/some_odd_experiences_ive_gone_through_what_do/,Some odd experiences I’ve gone through… what do they mean,"So I’ve had odd experiences as far as I can remember. I don’t know much about mediumship and psychic abilities to be really honest but here’s my experiences and I’d love to get some insight from experienced mediums and psychics.

1. The most common occurrence is knowing where people are. If I’m out and about often times I know when I’m about to run into people I know. It’s not an everyday occurrence but it’s frequent enough that it can’t be considered a coincidence and it’s happened for years. For example I’ve always had kind of visions of running into a friend’s mom and then five to ten minutes later there she is! (While we were living in the same country obv)

Then multiple times I would have feelings like “oh my classmates are here,” turn the corner and boom classmates. Sometimes I’d know exactly who I was going to run into and other times it was just “someone from school is here” and there was never more than like five minutes between the thought/vision and the actual sighting of people. 

2. Predictions (?) also a sort of common occurrence like the one above. Most of the times words just fall out of my mouth like I’ll just say it in the middle of conversation or banter and like some are instant and some are delayed but they do come true. I can’t give an exact percentage of accuracy. 

Some examples I predicted a school lab computer malfunction. Predicted distress of a friend who lives across the planet multiple times and just called only for him to be like “shit dude I was just about to call you because I was having a rough day,”. I used to work at a cafe and a couple of times i predicted orders. (Which take with a grain of salt because I think that’s just a barista spidey sense). Predicted the ending of a couple relationships and life choices of some people (also grain of salt since that can be a deduction based on how much I know them?) 

3. Energies, vibes and presences. There’s a bunch of these this happens nine times out of ten. I used to work somewhere where they had a small metaphysical section and at one point they had ouija boards and the one time I walked by the boards I got dizzy and nearly blacked out. And it would happen so often I started avoiding that part of the store. 

Same store at closing there was always a lingering presence that used to just stare. I wasn’t the only employee who experienced this but it was just really intense (not in a bad way like with the ouija boards) 

In middle school I was in class and one day I got really spooked and started freaking out because I felt a very violent energy staring into my back and my teacher even asked like “what is going on with you hello?” 

I can feel presences lingering in places with objects etc. one of the most intense cases was we were going house hunting and i walked into the house and immediately my body when into fight or flight mode. It was a violent energy in the whole house and I needed to get out. It felt angry and unwelcome and I just remember grabbing my friend and being like “I can’t stay here there’s something wrong with this house. I need to go I’m gonna be sick.” And so we spent all of maybe 8 minutes in the house and we left and I went to class. I had coffee with me and I was fine through most of the class until one point where I started blacking out/fainting. Literally fighting to keep consciousness. This lasted about 20-30 minutes and then suddenly I was fine again like nothing at all happened.

There’s a bunch more of stuff. I do tarot readings and such too but that’s a recent thing and I’m still learning so I don’t know how much of that has to do with this? But yeah let me know what you think!! 

Edit: there was another big experience I had at a historical site. It was a Roman amphitheater. I remember walking into there and being so overwhelmed because I could sense death but also excitement and high energies of what I imagine was the crowed. It was so intense i remember literally buzzing from the energy and I could smell blood and sweat in the air. It was the winter months no one else could smell it (I asked my friends they thought I was crazy 😌) and i remember being so dizzy after I left that my friend had to kinda hold me up on the way out",1,1731791158.0,Mediums,1,1.0,False

1gswygc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarpetCleaning/comments/1gswygc/first_time_experience/,First Time Experience,"My carpet was *filthy*!  So filthy I couldn't take it any longer and committed to getting it cleaned.  But how? I saw 3 options:  1)  Pay to have someone clean it 2)  Buy a carpet cleaner machine 3) Rent a carpet cleaner machine.

My first plan was to **pay** to have my carpet cleaned. I saw a lot of quotes for $100 per room, but these were with companies I did not know.  I did have prior experience with a local carpet cleaner back when I was an apartment manager, and knew this guy did a good job.  I contacted him and he quoted me $300 for 400 sq ft.  At first I thought he was asking too much, but more on that later.

The next option was to **buy** a machine.  I did some research, went to Target, and bought one of those carpet cleaners for pet stains.  It cost around $100.  I can do my whole room with this, right?  Maybe so, but I had second thoughts.  I'd heard these lower-priced machines don't do an optimal job (although some people say otherwise, and for all I know they're right and these machines work well), but I decided I didn't want to risk it, or even own a machine (another thing to store), and so back it went to Target.

That left **renting** a machine.  But from who?  I opted to rent from Lowes because they have the Bissell Big Green Machine.  My research told me that the Bissell is somewhat better than the other rental carpet cleaners.  I'm glad I went with Lowes, because a friend who works at Home Depot told me their machines aren't maintained very well.

The people at Lowes were easy to work with.  I rented a Big Green Machine from them for $40.  I bought Bissell's most powerful carpet shampoo and that was another $25.

When I got home I went to work moving furniture and began the carpet cleaning process.  400 sq ft isn't a lot of carpet, but here's what I'd like to tell people about the job so they can manage it well:

It's kind of a lot of work, especially if you want to use the machine to the max.  Moving the machine around isn't that hard, but over a long stretch of time it's a workout  This is no big deal if your carpet isn't that dirty.  But my carpet *was* that dirty, so if I had to do the job all over again I'd plan on at least 3 hours of repeating the cleaning process.  I say that because though I got a ton of filth out of my carpets (the dirty water tank looked like a batch of dark roast coffee with a cup of coffee grounds thrown in for good measure), I went over the carpet again with just hot water, . . . and the water collected was *still* black.  By that time I'd had enough.  Ideally, I should have paced myself and spent several hours going over my carpet until the water was much cleaner. I should point out though that though I didn't get all the dirt out, the results I did get were outstanding --- my carpet looks so good now!  All the stains are out, and overall it looks pretty close to new.

Would it have been worth paying $300 for a top-of-the-line steam clean? I say yes, $300 is actually a fair price for a really good steam cleaner to come to your home and get your carpets thoroughly clean.  As I said, even one 400 sq ft room is a lot of work.  And cleaning the machine took nearly an hour.  The only hard part is cleaning the rollers and brushes.   Would it have been a good idea to pay $225 for one of the better home carpet cleaners, such as the Bissell Pro Heat 2x?  Probably so, as a friend of mine owns one and says it's great.   But as I mentioned, I didn't want to own a machine and didn't want to spent that much.  And so, I'm happy with my choice of renting the Big Green Machine.  It was totally worth the $65 investment (and I have carpet shampoo left over for a future clean).",0,1731791034.0,CarpetCleaning,1,0.5,False

A random fact: A Finnish word 'sumppi' is derived from Swedish word ""sump"" (transl. 'used coffee grounds') and means coffee made from used coffee grounds. Yes, I'm a Finn. Yes, I do love coffee.

The enclosure is bioactive with a nice, thriving cleaning crew. If you wonder why there are two lamps on top, the one on the right is led growth light for plants and the one on the left is a heat lamp. Before anyone gets shocked about the heat lamp, in winter our ambient room temp. is around 19-19.5 C (66 - 67.1 F) at night so the glass walls get rather cold as well. I know that cresties tolerate low night temps in winter, so I use ReptiPlanet Daylight Basking 25 W to slowly warm up the terrarium after misting in the morning and let it naturally drop again overnight :)

I was also avoiding potential triggers like egg, oat, and corn even though I wasn’t sure if they would cause issues. 

I had a drop in milk supply and started drinking lots of oat milk as part of my plan to get my supply back up. Simultaneously, I gave Tylenol twice because her first two teeth came in. Her poops looked watery, which seemed different and perhaps worse than mucousy. I attributed it to the Tylenol, but didn’t think it could have been the oat until over a week later. Stopped oat and her poops seemed a tiny bit better but not great. 

Decided to do another dairy trial. I ate cheese and monitored. Texturally her poop looked better immediately!! No other symptoms. The next day I had a small amount of milk with coffee. Behold, our first speck of blood. 

We finally have an allergist appointment this week after months of waiting for an opening. Of course we will discuss all this there, but I’m curious if anyone else saw improvement when adding dairy back? And whether the speck of blood is almost certainly related? ",1,1731790609.0,MSPI,0,1.0,False

**So a bit about me :D!** 

Personality wise I would consider myself friendly, shy at first, but when I get comfortable I can yap for hours lol, and I can be negative at times (smth I am working on), but definitely not always. 

**My hobbies/interests are:**

* Art - I love to create no matter what it is (unless it's creating drama). I like to paint and draw, but I've recently been losing interest in it :(hopefully the interest comes back). If I draw or paint I like to try doing it realistically.

* Video games - I like to play various games, but recently I've been getting back into more comfy and cozy games like Sims 4, Coffee Caravan, Minecraft, Cities: Skylines, Roblox (only dress to impress). I also play games like League of Legends, Apex Legends, Skyrim. Also waiting for Delta Force to get released (I only ran around and helped people instead of getting kills XD)!
* Crocheting and sewing - I love to crochet, and right now I have one messenger bag in my mind what I want to create! And I often upcycle my old clothes or sew something new from them.
* Listening to music - I love listening to music almost no matter what I do. Favorite genres are: Post Punk, Darkwave, Pop and indie Pop, some Rock and Metal, 80s Japanese pop and just random 80s songs.
* Working out - I have the idea of working out and going to the gym for a while now, maybe I just need a companion with who I can share my progress and struggles together, or I need to just do it :D.

So that's it about me :). If you feel like I'm your kind of person then don't be shy and send me a short introduction about yourself, and yeah, see ya! :D",1,1731790603.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Thanks for reading :). ",0,1731790586.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
1gswry2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/1gswry2/death_thoughts_and_then_it_happening/,Death thoughts and then it happening,"I get pretty frequent intrusive thoughts, the normal ones, though: drive my car over the highway, sexual ones, etc etc bad ones, neutral ones. They happen when I'm stressed and I've worked through therapy on how to handle them and ""disown"" them so they don't cause me distress. 

However.... In the last year and a bit I've been having ""premonition"" type intrusive thoughts. I'm now questioning a lot of things, including my own intuition and ability to manage my own thoughts.

In summer 2022, my best friend of 25 years went through a terrible breakup and a voice in my head said ""she won't last 6 months"". I thought nothing of it. 

She died 6 months later from an unknown medical issue on December 6, 2022. She was 39.

Then, in the early summer this year, I was talking to a friend who had surgery and was at home, healing. ""He's going to go any day now"". He died July 13 at 40 years old. 

I caught it sooner this time, though. My neighbor (and friend, she's 60)  pulled something in her hip in August. Soon after, my husband and I went by with flowers and cake to cheer her up, since she was in a ton of pain. ""She's dying"", my inner voice said. Yesterday, her husband came over for coffee and told us that she has lung cancer and has been given ""maybe 3 weeks"". So, I'm going over again today but also what the fuck.

Needless to say, I'm now totally paranoid about ANY thoughts related to death.... And I'm wondering if I should change careers and be a death doula or something.",1,1731790518.0,intrusivethoughts,0,1.0,False
1gswrwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1gswrwf/no_after_service_coffee_hours_at_my_church/,"No after service ""coffee hours"" at my church","Hello, I'm an enquirer looking to join the church.

I've been going to church on and off the last several years. I have no been able to stay at one church for more than a few months due to a lifestyle that required me to travel frequently.

Last month I've finally settled in Poland and plan to stay here for the next several years at least. This allowed me to started attending to my local orthodox church a lot more regularly.

I have a few obstacles. One is the language barrier. Most people I have met, including the priest, only speaks Polish or Russian.

With my broken Polish I have asked if there were after service meet-ups, ""coffee hour"", ""lunch"", etc. I was told by the priest there was nothing like that here. People here seem to not hang around very much after the service is over. Quite often, I'm the last person in the room if I decide to wait and talk with the Father.

I have met a couple new people here at the church either by catching them on a public transport to-and-from the church, or striking a conversation right outside the church's entrance *during* the service.

One person I met has been attending to this church for almost a year, and they still have not begin his catechumen. Which discourages me slightly.

At initial impressions the priest felt pretty cold to me when I introduced myself as an enquirer. He sent me off to someone who spoke some English. He told that I should come to the church for the heart, and I can work on my mind at home through the Internet.

I am somewhat discouraged by this, but I intend to continue my participation at this church. I wished that I could be more directly guided by the Father, to meet with him outside the divine liturgy.

In that moment I deeply missed my greek orthodox church, who were very warm to me every time.

TLDR; what do you guys do when you don't have some kind of church meets up? I am alone in this city, and I wish to meet with people and develop a relationship with the church.

I am also told are no catechumen classes or groups available, these are only available for young children.",2,1731790514.0,OrthodoxChristianity,4,0.75,False
1gswrqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1gswrqn/waiting_out_a_stain_smell_secretly/,Waiting out a stain smell secretly,"Hey - not a woodcrafter myself (I crochet/knit instead), but got a handmade gift for my wife for Christmas from an etsy seller.  It's about 18"" square and a foot tall, beautiful, clearly recently made and stained.  When it arrived and I opened the box, the stain smell was strong (as one might expect, I would guess the seller shipped it as soon as it dried).

Typically, we'd open some windows, set up a fan, and have a good strong cross-breeze going for a day or two to help the smell dissipate. However, since this is a Christmas gift, I can't really do that out in the open.  I'm keeping it in my home office for secrecy, but there's no ventilation there so I can't just pull out it when I'm working to set up the same sort of breeze.  I do work from home, but she is home most of the day as well, so it's rare that I'd have more than a couple of hours to let it ventilate out in the open.

Right now the best thought I have is to sneak it out into the back yard onto the deck or onto a chair out of sight from where she usually goes to let it air out for a couple hours a day; at the risk of it being found (or, worse, surprise rain).  I've read some people suggesting vinegar or coffee grounds or baking soda to absorb the odor.  What's my best bet for getting the smell to disappear in secret before I have to wrap the thing / have her start wondering about the smell?",1,1731790502.0,woodworking,4,1.0,False

In trying to recall the recipe from the time my MIL helped her aunt make it as a child, she said the topping was some kind of beaten egg mixture poured on top of the batter.

1gswm21,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gswm21/the_key/,The Key,"I’m just an ordinary guy. Dead-end job, no friends or family worth mentioning, and a life that’s been going nowhere. But everything changed a year ago, and I’ve never been the same since.

It was a normal Friday evening, and I was on my way home from work when I hit a roadblock—literally. Roadworks forced me to take a detour, and just my luck, I got a flat tire. After a long, stressful week, I thought, Great. Just what I needed. I pulled over, popped the trunk, and started changing the tire.

That’s when I saw it—a glint of light catching the edge of something shiny. At first, I thought it was just some piece of trash, but when I looked closer, I saw it was a key. Old-fashioned, with a simple brass finish, no markings. It looked out of place.

I picked it up, slipped it in my pocket, and went about finishing the tire. The rest of the evening was uneventful. I got home, had a quick dinner, and went to bed, but that key stuck with me.

The next day, I woke up around noon—late, but that was nothing new. I poured a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table, absentmindedly picking up the key. I turned it over in my hands. It was heavy, almost too solid for something so old. It didn’t look like it belonged to anything familiar.

Out of curiosity, I decided to see if I could figure out who it belonged to. But as I looked closer, I saw no identifying marks. So, I shrugged, set it down, and finished my coffee.

Later that afternoon, boredom got the best of me. I was pacing around the house when I passed the basement door. I don’t know why, but I stuck the key in the lock, just to see what would happen. To my surprise, the lock clicked open.

I froze. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Was this some kind of prank? But I had to see what was behind the door. So I opened it.

What I saw… I can’t explain it. It was a city—a city that looked like mine but wasn’t. The skyline was similar, but the buildings were off, and the streets felt subtly wrong. I stepped into the doorway, heart pounding, and looked around.

I’ll admit it—if you had a chance to step into a whole new world, wouldn’t you? I walked out onto the street, and no one seemed to notice me at first. I stopped a passerby and asked, “Where am I?”

They stared at me like I’d lost my mind. I must’ve looked crazy. I repeated myself, but they just brushed me off and walked away. I felt a surge of panic. Am I losing it?

I tried to calm myself. This is just a weird version of my city, I thought. It can’t be real.

I found a newspaper stand and picked up a local paper. My eyes scanned the front page, and my stomach dropped. This was my city, yes, but everything in the paper was off. Shops I’d never heard of. Buildings I didn’t recognize. It didn’t make sense.

My first instinct was to get home. I knew my city well enough to navigate it by heart, even if something felt… wrong. But as I walked through the streets, I started to notice even stranger things—roads that didn’t exist, signs in languages I didn’t recognize.

Eventually, I found my street. My house. Or, I thought it was. I didn’t have my keys on me. When I had gone through the basement door, I’d forgotten to bring them. Great, I thought. I’m locked out of my own house in a city that doesn’t make sense.

Luckily, I got along well with my neighbor. I knocked on their door, hoping they’d have a spare key. But when a stranger answered, I froze.

“I’m sorry, can I speak to the owner?” I asked. “I’ve locked myself out.”

The person eyed me warily. “I’ve lived here for thirty years. The guy who lives next door is an old man. He’s never looked anything like you. Now leave, or I’ll call the cops.”

My heart sank. Something’s wrong. Really wrong.

I backed away, thinking. Then I remembered the key. It had gotten me here, so maybe it could get me home. I turned and made my way back to the city, to the door. I found it again, hidden on a quiet corner, and inserted the key.

But before I turned it, something caught my eye—a TV screen in a store window. The president was on the screen, giving a speech. But it wasn’t my president. The man on the screen wasn’t anyone I recognized.

I turned the key anyway, and stepped back through the door.

I felt a wave of relief, then disbelief. The door had led me back… but not to my house. Instead, I was in a store, surrounded by people staring at me. I looked around, but nothing made sense. The room I’d come through was gone, replaced by a sterile, unfamiliar store.

Panic surged. I turned around and spotted a bathroom. I needed to gather myself. But when I stepped inside and took out the key again, something happened. I inserted it into the bathroom door—and on the other side? A landscape. Not a store. A vast, open field.

Confused, I pulled back, but then something clicked in my mind. The key… it’s not just opening doors. It’s opening… worlds.

I tried again, and each time I opened the door, I saw a different place. A living room. A crowded mall. Then, one time, I opened the door to a dark room, a room with no windows or doors.

I turned around to see a man in a black suit standing in the center of the room. But he wasn’t human. His face was… static. It was like watching a TV with no signal—flickering and fuzzy. The figure advanced toward me.

“You’ve been meddling with things you don’t understand,” it said, its voice like a thousand voices tangled together. “Tell me everything you know about the key. Now.”

Fear clamped down on me. The thing wasn’t human, but it was something else—something ancient. And I knew I couldn’t escape unless I played along.

I answered as best as I could, my mind racing. I can’t let it know that I don’t know anything. I need to get out of here.

In my pocket, the key was still there, untouched. I felt a surge of hope. Maybe it was the only way out. But before I could think clearly, the thing lunged at me, pulling out a strange device. It looked like a knife, but it had lights and a display, like some kind of technology from another world.

It stabbed me, twice, once across my left arm. I screamed, adrenaline rushing through my veins. I grabbed the knife and plunged it into the creature’s face, shattering its flickering visage.

I ran.

I don’t know how many dimensions I passed through, but each time I opened a door, I was further away from that thing. I didn’t stop running until my body was covered in sweat, blood dripping from my arm.

When I finally stopped, I found myself in a tiny village. The people looked… strange. Like they didn’t understand the concept of hunger. When I asked where I could get food, they stared at me blankly, as if the question made no sense.

Then, one of them laughed—a cruel, echoing laugh. “You’re confused, child,” she said. “Let me show you how we get our energy.”

She looked to the sky, and her face split open, revealing a giant flower inside.

I recoiled in horror, but then, from the corner of my eye, I saw it again.

The thing.

It was following me.

I ran.

I quickly opened a door and ran through when I was hit with an intense heat like I’d stepped into the heart of a furnace. I was inside a small, unfamiliar room, sweat pouring from me, my breaths shallow with fear. I had to move. The creature, that thing I’d barely escaped, was coming through the door again. I fumbled for the key in my pocket, but before I could reach it, the door creaked open, revealing nothing but darkness on the other side.

I ran.

The other side of the room had a second door—no keyhole, just a plain wooden surface. Panic surged through me. I threw myself at it, pushing it open, and found myself in what seemed like an abandoned warehouse. The heat was stifling here too, but I barely noticed it as I scanned the vast, empty space. I couldn’t stop now. I had to find a way out before the thing found me.

I darted toward a large opening on the far side of the building, the world outside tinged with an eerie, unnatural red. It took a moment for my brain to register what I was seeing—fires, everywhere. The horizon was nothing but smoke and burning wreckage. Buildings, trees, bodies. The acrid scent of burning flesh and wood filled the air, and I had to fight the urge to collapse, to vomit. Adrenaline kept my legs moving, but the terror in my chest made every step feel heavier.

I didn’t know how long I walked. Hours, maybe. Every place I found that looked like a possible door was either burned to the ground or too dangerous to approach. The world felt endless, a suffocating nightmare, and the heat—always the heat—was making it harder to breathe. When I finally saw movement in the distance, people, my heart leapt. I staggered toward them, barely able to speak when I got close enough. All I could manage before blacking out was one word: “Water.”

I woke up tied to a chair, surrounded by people in black robes. They had their backs turned, speaking in low, harsh tones, their voices thick with purpose. Panic gripped me as I tried to understand what was happening. My body ached, my wounds still fresh from my previous encounter with the creature, but I forced myself to focus.

I asked, my voice weak, “What’s happening? Why am I tied up?”

One of them turned toward me, a figure that looked almost human, but something about the face was wrong. Too still, too cold. He stepped closer, and his whisper crawled across my skin. “Child of God, what is it you believe?”

I didn’t understand. “What? Who are you? Why am I—”

“Answer me,” he hissed, eyes flashing with a strange intensity. “What do you believe?”

I repeated my question, trying to sound more confident, though my voice shook. “What’s going on here?”

The figure took a deep breath, as if savoring the moment, before his face twisted into a sneer. “We, the sons of Lucifer, demand your faith. You will no longer be a child of God. We are as one, and we will bring about the rise of our father once more.”

I froze, not knowing what to say. I wasn’t religious—I didn’t know how to respond to something like this. But I knew I had to say something to get them to stop. “I’ll do whatever you want,” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

They laughed. A deep, mocking laugh, and the man who had spoken before shouted, “Blasphemer!”

The others repeated it, over and over, a chant that wore me down, each word digging deeper into my chest. They taunted me, called me every name under the sun, and as they did, one of them muttered in a language I didn’t recognize—Latin, maybe? I only knew English, but the sound of the words made my skin crawl.

I didn’t care anymore. I wanted out. I was exhausted—mentally, physically—and I wasn’t sure how much longer I could hold on. I pulled at my restraints, desperate to free myself, but the pain of my wounds made it almost impossible. At some point, I passed out.

I woke again to a sound—a massive crash that shook the room. The chanting had stopped. I opened my eyes, heart pounding, but the room was empty. My restraints were still in place, but the robed figures were gone. The silence was suffocating.

Another crash, closer this time, followed by a series of loud, heavy footsteps. The floor trembled under each step. My mind raced, my pulse quickening as I realized what was coming. I had to get out, had to move. I pulled at the ropes, harder now, desperation fueling me.

The sound stopped. My breath caught in my throat as I looked to my left and froze.

A monster stood there.

It was humanoid, its massive form towering over me. Dark, like a shadow, with claws long enough to tear through steel. Its teeth were jagged, gleaming, but it was its eyes that paralyzed me—black, infinite, staring into me like they could see every dark thought I’d ever had. I couldn’t look away. A rush of cold dread washed over me.

I froze.

The creature raised its hand, and with one swift motion, it slashed at my abdomen. Pain exploded across my body. Blood poured down my legs, pooling beneath me. I screamed, vision blurring, but then… nothing. The creature raised its hand again, preparing for a final blow.

I closed my eyes. There was no escape.

But nothing came.

I opened my eyes.

I was back in the same room. The same sterile, oppressive space, tied to the same damn chair. The wounds on my abdomen were gone, healed, as though they’d never been there. My mind reeled. What was happening?

And then I saw it.

A figure, standing in the corner, unmoving. The static-faced thing. The creature I had hoped to never see again.

I started crying, not out of fear but exhaustion. I had nothing left to give.

The creature’s voice, mechanical and cold, sliced through the air. “You are telling the truth, aren’t you?”

I could barely speak, my throat dry, my voice hoarse. “Yes… I’m done. I don’t care anymore. Just kill me.”

The creature didn’t move, but the voice came again, calmer now. “What would you do to get out of this alive?”

I looked up at it, disbelief flooding my veins. “What? You want me to beg? You want me to… please, just… kill me.”

There was a long pause before the creature spoke again, its voice surprisingly softer now. “I can do that. But first, I need to show you something.”

It stepped forward, and with a slow, deliberate motion, reached up to its own face. The static flickered and twisted, pulling away like a mask, revealing… me.

Another version of me.

I staggered back, mouth agape. “What the hell…?”

The other me smiled, or at least, something resembling a smile. “This is what I am,” it said. “And what I want. I want every single version of us. These cages…” It gestured around the room, and I saw them then—dozens, hundreds of cages, each containing a person in a jumpsuit and a metal mask. “These are all you, from different dimensions. And I want every one of you.”

I barely heard the rest of what it said, something about choices and freedom. The words felt like they were slipping through my fingers, fading into nothing.

“You have a choice,” the other me said, its voice cold, calculating. “You can join me and become part of my collection, or you can help me gather the others.”

A lump formed in my throat. I knew what I had to do. “I’ll help you.”

The creature nodded, pleased. “Good. You’ll use the key. Find the others, and once you do, use this.” It handed me a small device, pressing a button on it. “This will signal me. And I’ll come for them.”

I wanted to scream, to break free, but I couldn’t. “One more thing,” it said, its voice darkening. “Don’t try to run. If you do, I’ll drop you in a dimension far worse than this one.”

It opened a door, and I stepped through. A new world. A new Earth.

And now, I’m here, writing this. You need to know the truth. The creature, the other me—it’s coming for you. It’s already found my version here. I’m leaving this story behind, hoping that someone, somewhere, will listen. It’s not too late. You have to fight.

The key is the only way to stop this. You need to find it before it finds you.",2,1731790053.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

So I'm a uni student, learning asl. Been learning for about a year now, going well! Started going to asl socials last semester and it's a nice way to learn, though very daunting at first.

Last month I met a girl at one of these that's deaf, and we started talking. Turns out she goes to my university too, which was cool! She's super cute and I was super nervous, but we ended up exchanging numbers, and talk a lot.

Last week I decided to ask her out while we were grabbing lunch at the cafeteria. I asked if she wanted to date and she got... Really upset? She looked mad and sad at the same time and just left, and wouldn't answer my texts. Next time I had class, I asked my professor if I signed everything right, turns out I asked her if she wanted to fuck, not date. I'm an idiot.

I’m a CODA. *(Editor's Note: A child of deaf adults)*

With that said, my Mom would have died laughing if this happened to her! Most deaf people are aware the signs are similar….especially for “newbies”.

I don’t blame her for being offended but please don’t give up signing. Things like this honestly happen all the time. I had a friend mix up signs once and called my dad an Assh0le (his name sign is similar). It happens. Most deaf people are very forgiving, mostly because there’s only a small percentage of hearing people that sign. They really enjoy when people go out of their way to learn to communicate with them. Please don’t give up! [[PostSingle]](https://www.reddit.com/r/asl/comments/17a4or7/made_a_big_mistake_asking_out_a_deaf_girl/k5dpnk5/)

Hey y'all! I didn't expect that last post to explode so much, that was unexpected. Wanted to thank everyone that gave advice, or stories! Both made me feel better, even if I didn't get to reply to you :)

There were also some less nice people in my DMs that were being kinda creepy, so I'll clarify that yes, me and her are both women (though, the people in my DMs would probably call us females.) okay, onto the update!

So I texted her shortly after posting my post, explaining the mistake. Apparently what went wrong is that after I signed fuck, she signed it back to clarify, and I said yes. She said she forgives me (because I'm cute, yessss!), but to not solicit her in the future, to which I said I'll do my best. I asked her out for coffee this weekend, and made sure to point out that I'm asking over text so I don't mess up that sign too. She said yes, so we have our first official date this weekend! I'm super excited :)

Also, after that we kept texting, and talking about if we drink. Neither of us do, so I joked that I don't have to worry about messing up the sign for alcohol either. That netted me four 🤣 emojis. A pretty good sign, if you ask me.

*January 6, 2024, almost 3 months later*

Firstly, this isn't a bad update! Just had some people who wanted an update, so I decided to do one last update. Thank you everyone for the kind words in the last two posts :)

So! Been a couple months, things are going very well. She's taught me a lot of fun words my professor doesn't, haha. She makes me very happy, it's hard to focus when she's trying to teach me new signs, I just get distracted by how cute she is! (She tells me that excuse stopped working after the second time I used it.)

I went to her's for a Christmas eve dinner, where I met her family for the first time. I was worried that her family would think it's too soon for me to go to something special like that, but her parents asked her to invite me! I think her parents thought it would make me less stressed, but the stress to impress was daunting 😵‍💫 Her brother is hearing and her parents are deaf, was nervous for sure but it was good practice and experience. I think I made good impressions, which is nice.

After dinner, her, her brother, and I hung out. He and I talked about video games and nerded out over Baldur's Gate 3 for a while. (united in our love for Karlach!) My girlfriend teasingly said she felt like a third wheel 🤭

Anyway, that's the update! Things are going really good, and I love my girlfriend. Thanks everyone for all the advice and courage to actually go back and talk to her, I was so embarrassed I almost just gave up. So glad I didn't.

*November 16, 2024, 1 year later*

Really small update, but I just remembered this account existed and came back to see a handful of people messaged me, asking how things are going! It's been about a year since my last post, so I thought it couldn't hurt.

Firstly, yes! We're still together, and I still love her a lot. Honestly, I feel like I love her more every day. My signing just keeps getting better and better, and I feel like it's strengthened our relationship too.

Secondly, we aren't engaged or married or anything yet! Neither of us are super crazy about marriage or anything, and we don't want to rush things so we're just enjoying each other without worrying about any of that.

Funny story! We went to see a movie in February, and I had the idea to interpret for her what they were saying! It... Didn't go well. Turns out it's hard to interpret in a dark movie theater. We just left early, got dinner, and played mini golf. Was a very funny experience.

So yeah, that's it! I love my beautiful girlfriend and I like to kiss her pretty face. Maybe I'll update again next year, who knows.

I (29F) was diagnosed about a year and half ago with endometriosis via laparoscopic surgery. They said my case is a little strange because I have minimal endometrial growths, but they are very widespread throughout my pelvis. They found growths on my rectum and sigmoid colon, but they said it was fairly superficial and did not penetrate through the intestinal wall. 

That being said, I have struggled with crazy chronic constipation since I started having endo symptoms with very little treatment success. I've tried increasing my fiber intake, my water intake, cutting out simple carbs, the whole nine yards. Nothing. Works. Except for coffee! I've found that the only reliable treatment for me is drinking a morning cup of coffee! Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone else still suffer from chronic constipation even after surgery? Also, is there a chance that my endo could have grown back again after having my lesions removed only a year and a half ago? Does this mean I'd benefit from surgery again?

Sorry if this is super confusing, it's a confusing situation lol. Any advice other than increasing fiber, exercising more, and drinking more water would be greatly appreciated! Thanks 💕",1,1731789792.0,endometriosis,13,1.0,False

They’re all wonderful people and we’ve been friends since school.

When I was 17/18 I absolutely loved to party. I wouldn’t miss a night out. Then I hit 20s and just lost interest. I enjoyed hanging out and the odd night out but in general my appetite to get drunk just completely disappeared.

As I got older I am really into wellness and fitness. I would much rather a hike or to meet for a coffee and a chat.

Luckily my friends as individuals all seem to feel the same way. We do lots of coffee dates and hikes and never involves drinking or overnight stays.

Lately there’s this push in our group to do girls trips away. I always feel excited at first. Who doesn’t love a weekend away with friends, but by the end of it I’m miserable and just want to go to my own home.
I’m overly exhausted and it takes me ages to recover. 
I just want to be home with my dog, son and husband. Probably in that order (sort of joking).

Anyway, I do love my friends but I dread these trips away but I feel if I don’t go everyone will say I never do anything. It’s like as a group everyone changes. It also makes me wonder if I do too, but I feel I don’t.

Does anyone else experience this? I understand as you get older you want comforts. 
Im 32 now so I know that’s part of it, but I do wonder why I’m so different to the others who seem to genuinely love every second and not want to go home by the end. ",1,1731789781.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

\_\_\_\_  
 

I grabbed my overcoat from the drawer, a necessary accessory for any self-respecting investigator—or so I told myself. It was more about getting into character, feeling like I was stepping into a role that would help me unravel the mystery of last night.

As I reached for the door, my eyes caught the key stand. My bike—the one that should have been my ride to the afterlife—was nowhere to be found. The keys weren't on the stand, nor had I found them in the clothes I was wearing during the accident. It was as if the bike had vanished into thin air.

The exact location of the accident was a blur, a hazy memory lost in the chaos of that night. To be honest, who pays attention to their surroundings when the accelerator is stuck on high and the brakes have decided to take an unannounced vacation? I had a general idea of the area, but with a margin of error of a kilometer or two, it wasn't exactly encouraging.

Untrusting of machines that run on petroleum, I opted for my trusty bicycle. I grabbed the lock key and slipped out the door, careful not to wake my sister. The investigation was about to begin.

...

...

You know what...I shouldn't have worn the damn overcoat.

Seriously, who rides a bicycle in the middle of the city looking like Sherlock Holmes' eccentric cousin? The morning rush, though thankfully lighter than a weekday, was still enough to earn me a collection of bewildered stares. I’m pretty sure I'll never forget the little kid in the kindergarten uniform pointing at me and asking his mom, ""Mommy, look at that funny man!"" And the mother, damn he-ahem, I mean, bless her judgmental soul, telling him not to stare at strange people.

Well, water under the bridge, I guess. Just another awkward memory to bury under a mountain of even more awkward memories. Wait… doesn’t that mean I need more awkward moments to bury the previous ones? It’s like some sort of Ouroboros of cringe.

Anyway, the closer I got to the supposed accident site, the more deserted the streets became. Like, seriously deserted. I hadn't seen a single soul in the last two minutes. I just kept pedaling, following the highway, which was supposed to be bustling with traffic. Even for a Saturday, this was ridiculous. Where was everyone?

Suddenly, my vision blurred, like a rush of wind had hit me square in the face. I stopped, rubbing my eyes. “What the hell was that?” I muttered, glancing around. Nothing. Just empty road stretching out before me. Shrugging it off, I got back on the bike and continued.

Moments later, two figures materialized in the distance, decked out in full SWAT gear, complete with intimidating-looking firearms. “Oh shit, don't tell me…” I mumbled, a knot of unease tightening in my stomach. They noticed me immediately. A flicker of confusion crossed their faces before hardening into steely determination. With reflexes that would make a ninja jealous, they raised their weapons, aiming directly at me.

“HALT! DO NOT MOVE!” one of them barked, his voice amplified by some kind of speaker system.

“Whoa, easy there, fellas,” I said, trying to keep my voice light despite the fact that my heart was doing a frantic tap-dance against my ribs. “Maybe point those big, black… persuasion devices somewhere else? I’m prone to nervous bladder malfunctions.”

“SHUT UP!” the other one yelled. “DISMOUNT THE VEHICLE! KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!”

“Dismount? But she’s such a lovely steed,” I quipped, still perched on my bicycle. “Besides, why the sudden hospitality? I’m just out for a morning ride.”

“You are trespassing on a secured area!” the first one shouted. “Now, GET ON THE GROUND!”

“Secured area, huh?” I muttered as I swung my leg over the bike and placed it gently on the asphalt. “I just put on clean clothes this morning…” I raised my hands in mock surrender which earned me a grunt from the grumpy soldiers.

“Alright, alright, don't shoot. I'm going, I'm going.” I slowly lowered myself to the ground, the cool asphalt a stark contrast to the sudden heat that had flared up in my face. “Mind telling me what I’m being detained for?”

“You’re trespassing,” the first guard repeated, his voice laced with impatience. “Now shut the fuck up.”

I complied, but not without a sarcastic, “Well, that’s just lovely. Can I at least request a pillow? The ground’s a tad bit chilly.”

Ignoring my attempt at humor, one of the guards pulled out a transponder and started speaking into it. “Command, we’ve got an intruder in the third sector. Requesting instructions.”

I couldn’t make out the full reply, but I heard a few words that sent a shiver down my spine: “Detain... Bring to base...”

The guard gave a sharp, “Affirmative,” and then snapped back to me with an icy glare. “If you move even an inch, I’ll put a bullet in you. Understood?”

“Uh, does breathing count?” I asked, my voice a tad too shaky for my liking. “I’ve got a bit of a history with breathing issues.”

No reply. Just a cold stare and the muzzle of a gun pointed directly at me. The second guard walked over and cuffed my hands behind my back with a efficiency that made me wonder if he’d been a scout leader in a past life.

With my arms secured, they yanked me to my feet and marched me forward. The further we went, the more surreal the scene became. We crossed into an area littered with white and black tents, each bearing a strange symbol that looked like a cross between a biohazard sign and some ancient rune.

“Holy fuck,” I breathed, taking in the sight before me. There, in the center of it all, was a crater. A honest-to-god, ten-meter-wide crater, like someone had dropped a small meteor there. People in white hazmat suits were moving around, carrying equipment and taking measurements.

“What the hell happened here?” I muttered, more to myself than to my captors. But they didn’t respond. Just kept marching me forward, towards one of the larger tents.

As we approached the larger tent, a figure emerged from the shadows, silhouetted against the harsh artificial lights inside. This guy was different from the grunts who had apprehended me. He was dressed in a crisp, black suit that looked like it had been ironed with a razor's edge. His hair was slicked back, and he had an air about him that screamed authority—the kind of authority that didn't need a badge or a gun to make you feel small.

He eyed me with a mix of curiosity and annoyance, his gaze so intense it made me want to squirm. I felt like a bug under a magnifying glass, and I didn't like it one bit. There went my hope of going home anytime soon. Hell, I'd be lucky if they didn't decide to dissect me just to see what made me tick. Hopefully, they leave my dearest Excalibur alone, it deserves to be preserved for future generation's appreciative gaze.

""Is this the one?"" he asked no one in particular, but Grumpy Guard Number One was quick to respond.

""Sir, yes, sir! We found him riding a bicycle straight toward the incident site.""

Hey! How was I supposed to know they'd claimed the area? It's not like there was a big neon sign saying, ""Top-Secret Illuminati Knockoff at Work.""

""So, how are you guys doing here?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice light despite the nervous tremor that threatened to give me away. ""Found any aliens or anything?""

The suit didn't bat an eye. ""No. Who sent you here?"" Straight to the point, no bullshit. I had to admire his efficiency, even if it was currently directed at me like a lit blowtorch.

""Would you believe that I was just out to get some milk for my little babies at home?"" I tried to laugh, but it came out more like a nervous squeak.

He raised an eyebrow. ""I might have been inclined to believe you if you hadn't bypassed multiple mystical fields undetected."" He glanced at my overcoat with a look of distaste. ""And that's me not mentioning anything about that ugly overcoat of yours.""

""Hey, that's rude as fuck,"" I grumbled, genuinely offended. My overcoat was beautiful. Okay, maybe it was a bit worn, and the color was more of a dull brown than the rich chocolate it had been when I first bought it, but still. It had character. ""And what's this mystical field you're talking about? I didn't see any field while coming here.""

The suit stepped closer, his eyes narrowing. ""The mystical fields are designed to keep people out, to make them ignore this area entirely. The fact that you're here, that you managed to bypass them without so much as a blip on our radar..."" He paused, his voice dropping to a low growl. ""It makes me think you're not just some clueless idiot out for a bike ride.""

I shrugged, trying to maintain an air of nonchalance. ""Sorry to disappoint, but I'm just your average, everyday clueless idiot. No mystical field-bypassing skills here."" I spread my hands—well, as much as I could with them cuffed behind my back—and gave him a sheepish grin.

The suit didn't smile back. Instead, he gestured towards the tent. ""We'll see about that. Bring him inside.""

As they led me into the tent, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just stepped into something far bigger and far more dangerous than I could have ever imagined. And all because I decided to wear that damn overcoat.

After strapping my hands to the arms of a chair that looked like it belonged in a low-budget spy thriller, the two grumpy guards left me alone in a bare-ass room inside the tent. I had been thoroughly searched, and they had taken everything I had on me, barring my clothes. They even made me pass through a weird metal-detector gate thing three times. Talk about lackadaisical efficiency.

The tent was larger than I had expected. Seriously, it looked more like a quickly assembled house than a tent from the inside. The walls were lined with various equipment and monitors, and the air was filled with a low hum of machinery. I couldn't help but feel a mix of curiosity and dread. What the hell was this place, and why was I here?

After what felt like an eternity, the suit guy entered the room, holding a tablet in his hand. He scrolled through it, his eyes flicking over the screen as he began to speak.

""Alexander Hartley, 28 years old, single child of Margaret and Thomas Hartley, who currently reside off-town. Graduated with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from State University, followed by a Master's in Computer Science. Currently working as a freelance 3D asset designer in the city.""

He looked up from the tablet, his eyes meeting mine with an intensity that made me squirm. ""Quite the impressive resume, Mr. Hartley.""

I raised an eyebrow, trying to hide my growing unease. ""Yeah, thanks for the recap, but I already know all that. It's not like I hit my head on a wall and lost my memories.""

The suit guy ignored my sarcasm and continued, ""Your parents are currently on a cruise, celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary. You have no siblings, no significant other, and your closest friend is a guy named Jake Thompson, whom you've known since high school.""

I shifted uncomfortably in the chair, the metal cuffs digging into my wrists. ""Okay, so you've done your homework. What's your point?""

He set the tablet down on a nearby table and crossed his arms, leaning against the edge. ""My point, Mr. Hartley, is that you're something of an enigma. You have no criminal record, no known affiliations with any organizations that would be interested in our... activities here. And yet, here you are, sitting in our tent, having bypassed our security measures without so much as a blink.""

I shrugged, trying to maintain a facade of calm. ""Like I said, I'm just a guy out for a bike ride with questionable dressing choices. Maybe your security measures need an upgrade, whatever these mystical fields you're using.""

The man in the suit placed his finger on my chest, his gaze sharpening like a blade. ""That is indeed a possibility, but the chances of that happening are vanishingly small. And in my line of work, we do not bet on chances. So how about you tell us how you bypassed three separate fifth-order mystical fields before we are forced to use... less than pleasant means to find the truth ourselves?""

I sighed in exasperation and looked straight into his eyes. ""Before I answer your question, how about you answer some simple doubts of mine? A bit of pity for poor me?""

He walked back, pulled a chair, and sat down cross-legged, a flicker of amusement in his gaze. ""Go on, ask your doubts. The chances of me giving answers to them are minuscule, but I'm willing to entertain them for a moment. Things have been going slow here, so I have some time to spare.""

""Very encouraging,"" I muttered. ""So, first question first, who are you people? What happened here?""

He looked a bit surprised and stared at me with a strange gaze. ""That's a question I wasn't expecting. If you're a spy, either you're one of the best or one of the worst I've ever seen. I sense not a single ounce of false intent in your questions. You're genuinely curious?""

""Bruh, I never had false intent to begin with,"" I replied, rolling my eyes. ""Couldn't you have 'detected' it earlier? And how do you even detect it? Some lie-detector built into this sex-dungeon chair or something?""

He chuckled, leaning back in his chair. ""I have my means, can't disclose them obviously. Secrets and all that. And no, it's not some lie-detector, as much as I would love to have one that works on everybody. Would make this work quite a bit less tedious."" He shrugged with a hint of laughter. ""Well, leaving that aside, let's focus back on you.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""So you now know I'm telling the truth when I say I have no idea who you people are or what happened here. So, how about a little quid pro quo? You answer my questions, and I'll answer yours. Fair's fair, right?""

He leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs as he contemplated my proposal. After a moment, he nodded. ""Alright, Mr. Hartley. I'll play your game. We are a... specialized task force, dealing with phenomena that fall outside the purview of ordinary law enforcement. As for what happened here, let's just say it was an incident of significant magnitude that required our immediate attention.""

I whistled softly. ""Specialized task force, huh? Government-sanctioned or just playing around in secret without Uncle Joe knowing?""

He coughed slightly, a hint of unease in his demeanor. ""We... have the required permits and authority by governments worldwide.""

Sussy.

He continued, ""Now, my turn. How did you bypass our security measures?""

I sighed, running a hand through my hair—or at least imagined doing so, since I couldn't really do it with the cuffs on. ""Look, I don't know anything about your mystical fields or whatever. I was just out for a bike ride, trying to figure out what happened to me last night. You know, I like those investigation shows, so I was just out doing a bit of it myself and—""

He raised his eyebrow, leaning forward with renewed interest. ""Hold on, what happened last night?""

Ah, fuck it, can't hide this thing anyway.

""So you see, I was playing this game called Mark: Survival Devolved last night in a gaming cafe. In the game, you play as a dino named Mark who roams around a human city, with the aim of making slaves out of humans. He beats them up after dragging them into an alley, and then force-feeds them weird food until they become obedient out of sheer terror.""

He stared at me with a deadpan expression, clearly wondering why the hell I was talking about the game. But he didn't lose focus. ""Interesting game you speak of. So did something happen to you while playing this game? Any weird experience, anything out of the normal?""

""Oh, no, nothing happened. I just played it until late night, around 12, I guess. Paying the charges, I walked out of the cafe.""

He maintained his stare, his mind clearly racing. ""So what happened after?""

""I took out my bike from the parking lot and started driving. I was feeling all good; after all, who doesn't after a bit of forceful slavery, huh?"" I nudged toward the exasperated suit guy.

He raised an eyebrow. ""Ah, you are no fun. Okay, okay, let me continue. The next part is important. So suddenly, my bike's accelerator got stuck on full throttle. And then I panicked and pressed the brake, and guess what? I slowed down... for a second, before I heard a clunking noise under the bike. Lo and behold, I see something break and fall off the tires, and my brakes are suddenly all loose. Can you guess how pissy I got at that moment?""

I sighed, the memory of last night flooding back like a bad movie montage. ""As my bike was accelerating, it was becoming harder and harder to handle it on that small road. So, I maneuvered it towards the highway. You know, more space, fewer pedestrians to mow down.""

The suit guy perked up, his eyes narrowing with sudden interest. ""Is the highway you're talking about the same one where we are right now?""

""Correcto, fifty points to Gryffindor,"" I quipped, trying to lighten the mood. The suit guy wasn't amused, but he was definitely interested now. ""Anyway, I noticed there was a traffic jam up ahead, and not wanting to implicate anyone else in the accident, I turned my bike handle for a sudden turn.""

He leaned forward, his voice taking on a sharper edge. ""Quite noble of you. What happened then? How did you survive without a speck of injury on your body?""

I shrugged, the cuffs clinking against the chair. ""I... don't know. Everything else was a blur thereafter before going dark. I just woke up this morning in my bed, feeling confused. Ran up here to check what the hell happened. Now that I mention it, I should go and check up on the gaming cafe too. Because seriously, it all feels like a hazy dream.""

The suit guy's expression shifted, a mix of skepticism and intrigue playing across his face. He stood up abruptly, pushing his chair back with a screech that made me wince. ""A hazy dream, you say. Interesting choice of words, Mr. Hartley.""

He turned away, pacing the length of the room with his hands clasped behind his back. The silence stretched, punctuated only by the distant hum of machinery outside the tent. I could almost see the gears turning in his head, trying to piece together the puzzle I'd presented him.

Finally, he stopped pacing and turned back to me, his eyes gleaming with a newfound intensity. ""You mentioned a gaming cafe. Which one?""

""The one downtown, near the old theater. 'Epic Pixel.' You can't miss it—there's a giant neon sign of a joystick out front.""

The suit guy nodded, pulling out his tablet and tapping something into it. ""Epic Pixel. Got it. We'll look into it. But for now, let's focus on the here and now. We have discovered something on this incident site that might be of interest to you.""

I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""I'm always interested, but show me what you got.""

He tapped something else on the tablet and then pointed it toward me. On the screen was a picture of a crumpled mass of metal and other debris, but it was something I could recognize from sixty-nine light-years away.

""My baby... Look how they massacred my baby,"" I mumbled, my eyes welling up with tears. It was like seeing an old friend beaten and broken, left to rust in the dirt.

""Yours, I presume?"" he asked, his voice neutral, almost clinical.

""Yes,"" I choked out, trying to keep my composure. ""I could recognize that metallic texture, that color pattern, the—ahem, anyway, yes, it's definitely mine.""

He nodded, his eyes scanning me like I was some sort of puzzle he was trying to solve. ""Interesting. So, you claim you have no memory of what happened after your bike accelerated out of control and you turned to avoid the traffic jam. Yet, here you are, unscathed, and your bike is... well, not so lucky.""

I shrugged, the cuffs clinking against the chair. ""Like I said, it's all a blur. One minute I'm trying not to become a human pancake, the next I'm waking up in my bed like nothing happened.""

He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. ""And you expect me to believe that?""

""Believe what you want, buddy. I'm just telling you what I know. Which, admittedly, isn't much.""

He sighed, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on. ""Alright, Mr. Hartley. Let's say I believe you. That still leaves us with the question of how you bypassed our security measures. And how you managed to survive a crash that, by all accounts, should have left you in a similar state to your bike.""

I leaned forward, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Maybe I'm just lucky. Or maybe I've got a guardian angel watching over me.""

He snorted. ""Luck and guardian angels have no place in my line of work, Mr. Hartley. There's always an explanation, always a reason.""

""Well, when you find it, be sure to let me know. Because I'm just as curious as you are.""

He stood up abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. ""We'll see about that. In the meantime, I have some calls to make. Stay put.""

I raised an eyebrow, glancing down at the cuffs securing me to the chair. ""Not like I have much choice. But hey, while you're at it, could you bring back some coffee? I could use the caffeine. And maybe a tissue. You know, for my baby.""

He gave me a look that was somewhere between amusement and exasperation before exiting the room, leaving me alone with my thoughts once again. As the door flap closed behind him, I couldn't release the fart I was holding under my ass.

I am looking for my first grinder with my budget of 500€.
My preference is a single dosing grinder because I only drink coffee 2-3 times a week and take my time for my coffee making ritual. Also a low retention is important for me.
First I was thinking of the Niche Zero because of the conical burr which suits the dark roasted beans more that I use.
But because of the more complicated import and higher costs this will be not in my range.

I got now stuck with the DF64 Gen. 2 and the DF64e even both of them have a flat burr.

Are the improvements made between DF64 Gen. 1 and Gen. 2 also implemented in the DF64e? 
Or was the DF64e earlier released than the DF64 Gen. 2?

The advantage of the DF64e that I see is the 2 in 1 function.
So in case I settle to one specific roast I can switch to the hopper else I can use the single dosing.

What are your thoughts?

Thanks in advance!",2,1731789702.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1gswgp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gswgp9/update_to_my_chili_recipe_post_plus/,Update to my chili recipe post plus recommendations,"Here's my original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gdjmqm/cup_of_coffee_reduction_in_chili_how_much_to/

This is what I ended up doing:

I was nervous about adding coffee because I thought there was a good chance it would blow the flavor.

I decided to just go for it. I brewed a strong cup of coffee. Almost like espresso. I used about 3/4 of it.  It gave the chili a slightly earthy flavor, and the sauce was richer.

It was very good and I'll do that again the next time I make it.

The other thing I did, and this is the second time I've done it (and will do it from now on) is that I substitued some of the beef with ground italian sausage.

Again, there was a concern it would blow the flavor, especially with the spiciness and taste of italian. 

But chili is so much better with it. It's amazing. You get the spiciness, but if you don't use too much, you get these incredible flavors that beef cannot provide.

If I'm making a big pot, I use 1 1/4 beef and 1/2 italian sausage. Don't use too much of the sausage or you will blow the flavor. If you're only going to use one pound of meat, I suggest 3/4 beef, 1/4 sausage.  The ground italian sausage is the best. I get mine from Whole Foods. It's delicious.

I slow cook my chili, and for vegetables I use bell peppers and hominy. Hominy comes from corn, but it's got an earthy-sweet flavor that is different. I would never use corn in my chili. I think that's gross. Hominy is different enough and it tastes very good.

I also only use one can of tomato sauce, but never tomatoes. I don't like them in chili. 

I use a small amount of crushed red pepper, and with the italian sausage, this is a medium spice chili. If you don't like spice or if it gives you stomach problems, don't use either. Ground sausage is still good, but it doesn't compare to to the spicy italian.",1,1731789624.0,Cooking,1,0.67,False

1gswgd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1gswgd6/asking_for_equal_contribution_without_any/,Asking for equal contribution without any contribution,"Hi everyone,

I’m a master’s student wrapping up my degree in Artificial Intelligence/Security. For the past three years, I’ve been working on my thesis, which I believe has turned into a solid piece of research—hopefully good enough for a Usenix submission.

When I started my thesis, my advisor mentioned that one of his PhD students needed mentoring experience as part of his PhD requirements. My advisor thought it would be a good idea for this student to mentor me. However, throughout these three years, I’ve had virtually no meaningful help from him. We’ve had maybe 4 or 5 coffee chats where I told him what I was working on—probably about five hours of discussion total.

Fast forward to now: as I prepare to submit my paper, my advisor asked me to let this PhD student review it. He only reviewed the introduction, and that was it. Now, this student wants to be listed as an *equal contributor* on the paper.

The justification? Apparently, he needs to show significant work for his PhD, and this paper would help him meet that requirement. My advisor has hinted that I should “let him have it.”

I don’t mind acknowledging him as a second author, but calling him an *equal contributor* feels frustrating and unfair. It doesn’t reflect the reality of the work I’ve put in versus what he’s done.

What would you suggest I do? How should I handle this situation?",12,1731789598.0,AskAcademia,3,0.94,False

Actually a best friend is someone who totally gets you. I could compare with relationship, when it's the right person and not just a boyfriend/girlfriend or spouse, etc. 
A lot of people have best friends on the other side of the ocean. Your mother could be your best friend, your significant other. It does not need to be someone locally and in fact the moment real life time with a friend becomes obligatory it's no longer a friendship. 
Cliche but best friends are those with whom you shared the hardest and the happiest moments and not those you see every day for a coffee just because both of you are bored. 
This is why we more often grow apart with high-school buddies and college ones and neighbors. You were just people in the same place, not really  friends (of course exceptions exist). 

P.S.  You don't need friends in general maybe one real one who could be anyone including parent, sibling, partner ",0,1731789463.0,unpopularopinion,12,0.41,False
1gswemt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gswemt/started_fast_ended_fast_im_crushed/,"Started fast, ended fast. I’m crushed ","I (30 M) just moved to a new city about 4 months ago. I needed a fresh start and was so stoked to have the opportunity to explore a new place. As most people do when they arrive to a new place, I downloaded dating apps as I’m very much looking for a relationship. 

Almost immediately, I matched with a local girl and we began to talk. First, for about a week just over the phone and finally met up for a first date. When we matched on the app, the first thing she told me is that she was also new to the area and was “really only looking for friends”. I thought this was odd as there are plenty of ways to meet platonic folks without using dating apps. However, our talking very quickly evolved past platonic and more flirty/romantic.

After our date, we were very quickly talking daily and seeing each other every other day. Coincidentally, our apartments are walking distance, just two blocks apart, so it was quite easy to meet up even just for a walk to grab coffee together. 

Over the weeks, she (F 28) expressed that she was dealing with some anxiety and the potential of an ADHD diagnosis. I supported her through quite a few emotional moments where she cried to me about how frustrating the physical anxiety that she was feeling was. She also expressed that she felt bad that she was constantly dumping her thoughts and feelings on me. I didn’t mind. I told her that I enjoyed her company, liked the person I was getting to know and understood that we all have different seasons in our lives. That doesn’t make us unworthy of love/support/companionship, etc. 

While the emotional breakdowns were happening more and more frequently, we were still enjoying our time together. Having sleepovers at each others places, going on fun dates and even doing monotonous tasks together like grocery shopping - because we enjoyed each others company. 

Our sexual connection was fantastic but not the only way we connected. It seemed we were both content on some nights to just fall asleep cuddling and kissing. 

I will add: she mentioned a handful of times that she was weary of entering into a committed relationship. The main reason she cited: she felt she has so many things “wrong” with her at the moment that she feels she cannot even begin to think about offering enough of herself to another person. I told her I understood and that I was happy to just keep doing what we were doing; whatever that was. And she always agreed. 

Fast forward to this most recent Tuesday. We went on a nice date and she was normal. Expressed that she was finally feeling she could admit out loud that she “likes” me. I was ecstatic. We had fantastic sex (which she initiated) and spent the night together. Wednesday morning I went home to do some work and we met up later in the evening to go for a long walk (this was pre-planned earlier in the week). The evening walk was great and she, again, seemed normal. Not closed off, kissing me, seemingly fine. 

Then, Thursday morning she texted me when she woke up and I could tell something was off. She wasn’t as expressive as she usually is. I asked if she was alright and she immediately jumped to saying that the physical pain that her anxiety is causing feels too much to handle and that she feels it is best to take space. I was completely caught off guard. I tried to gently push back and ask if maybe she just needed a day to cool off. At first, she seemed to agree. I will admit, I did send a few other texts throughout the day as I was trying to understand why things were changing so suddenly. 

Friday morning (yesterday) she asked to meet in person to talk. In short, she said she feels the best thing she can do for herself right now is focus on her. And that she has no interest in being in a relationship. There was no changing her mind. She said she needed to cut off contact and just focus on herself.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. As you can imagine - I am confused and so deeply hurt. I really was beginning to fall for this girl. And I am having such a difficult time understanding how things changed so drastically, seemingly over night. While our time “together” was brief (about 3 months) I am struggling with this idea of not talking everyday. Not seeing each other. Not having our fun banter. 

On top of that, I was so wrapped up in getting to know her that I did not prioritize meeting other people in the area. So, here I sit just two blocks from the girl I want to see so desperately - but can’t. I’m alone.

Any advice on how to move on? When does it stop hurting? ",1,1731789462.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I dearly love my wife, always have despite supporting her through her PTSD and trauma episodes resulting in her putting me in hospital, several scars and not a word to anyone about the abuse. I married her, she's had a contraceptive implant and now she doesnt want sex. Despite her emotionally cheating on me for the first two years of our relationship. Despite 3 years of false accusations. Despite her having the balls to tell her parents and mine about me being raped as a kid knowing I never wanted anyone but her to know that about my life. I still love her, and I hate that I can't hate her truly.

It had already been 5 months and now at a year of no intimacy - not just sex, no nothing - cuddles, kissing, romantic stuff, even hand stuff. I actually used to ask permission to masturbate followed by justification of why I wanted to, what prompted the thought, to what I would  be doing it, where it would take place...

When talking about it she's said that ""you're attractive, just I don't find you attractive"", ""i might be a lesbian"", ""what if i dont like it, won't that upset you?"", ""I just dont get horny anymore"" ""i dont enjoy sex, i never have"" (despite fucking half her friend circles and colleagues in the past in every which way yet I've only ever been allowed missionary). 

I've been supportive throughout - if she's a lesbian fine... ""but i dont want to leave you"" I offered that she can have a girlfriend so long as I know she's safe and it isn't behind my back and that I'll remain monogamous.

Then... I made a couple of women friends in the local coffee shop where I work, they're regulars in there... erruptions about how im cheating etc simply by interacting in a place ive worked for years because I fully support our finances and cant afford to leave that job. They offered to take me out to meet some guys they know who are from my country and that was great but because one of the girls rang me that night to tell me how the guys were saying I was lame when I went the bathroom - Im now a cheater again for having a 'private gossip session' with my apparent 'work wife' (which like, doesnt even make sense since she's not a coworker lol).

Anyway, eventually I caved - never used porn in our relationship, I see that as cheating (despite her having no issues breaking that boundary repeatedly) but I caved and off I went. I did it so much, I ripped my frenulum. That was 6 months ago. I have kept masturbating just enough to keep it injured because it's reached the point where now, if I heal and despite talking about almost nothing but my wife to the coffee shop friends - I would 100% try fuck them now if healed. I don't even think they'd be interested and they love how I talk about my wife, still never a bad word about her, but they're moving away soon and honestly if my dick heals I will 100% blurt out ""my wife doesnt love me, no sex, you're leaving, please can we fuck"" which like... embarrassing I know but that's where I'm at in life now... like wtf.

I love my wife and want us to be happy. I don't even want to cheat but there is so much between us in certain areas, especially sexually, that she wont even discuss like an adult that frankly Im desparate for anything resembaling intamacy. Yet I don't want to so I essentially self-harm masturbate daily to keep those wounds too fresh to have sex.

I hate all of this, I hate myself, I hate her for being the way she is and having the trauma she has that has stopped us from being happy. I hate her for not allowing herself to be happy (her words, not mine - i have trauma too and that wouldn't be a fair statement but she said shes stopping herself and at this point fuck it).

I hate that the woman I love seemingly doesn't love me but knows I love her too much to ever leave.

1gswame,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1gswame/thinking_about_getting_a_gaggia_classic_evo_pro/,Thinking about getting a Gaggia Classic Evo Pro,"Hey everyone,

I hope you’re having a great day wherever you are! I have a question to share. I currently own a Delonghi Dedica Style espresso machine, and I’m considering upgrading to a brand new Gaggia Classic Evo Pro. My decision to upgrade isn’t due to any disappointment with my Delonghi; rather, I’m always looking to improve and elevate my coffee game.

I primarily use my machine to make lattes, as I’m working on enhancing my latte art skills. I’ve also had the opportunity to try machines like ECMs and a few Brevilles, but unfortunately, those aren’t available in my country (Chile) since we use 220V for electricity and the market offering is not as big as other countries.

In terms of upgrades, I haven’t changed much on my machine—I’ve just removed the capsule that goes over the steamer and invested in a better tamper.

**Aspects I like about my Delonghi and would like to maintain in a new machine:**

1. **Fast Heating:** I want a machine that is ready to use in less than 5 minutes. ECM takes 30 minutes to warm up, which is unacceptable for me.
2. **Ease of Use:** I find machines with manual indicators to be complicated. While I appreciate their aesthetics, they are not practical for me.
3. **Easy Maintenance:** Delonghi machines are very easy to maintain. I receive a yellow signal from the machine indicating when maintenance is needed.
4. **Lattes Made Easy:** I can make my morning latte without running late for work.
5. **Compact Size:** I have a small kitchen, so I appreciate a slim design.

**Aspects I don’t like about my Delonghi and would like to improve with a new machine**

1. **Cheap Materials:** The portafilter and the machine itself feel somewhat cheap. Although I’ve had this machine for two years and it works perfectly fine, it’s mainly a perception based on my experiences with other machines.
2. **Espresso Quality:** The extractions are okay most of the time. I know they aren’t technically great, but at my level, I can enjoy my morning latte without issues. However, compared to machines like the Breville Barista Pro, the extraction using the pressurized portafilter is noticeably different and stronger, even with the same coffee beans.

**Why am I interested in the Gaggia?:**

I’ve been researching local resellers and coffee stores, and it seems like the best option available in terms of size, capabilities, and materials.

What are your thoughts? I’m sure there are others out there who have had the Delonghi before!

Thank you all for your input and feedback.

My parents moved to Florida last year. I recently graduated college with an art education degree, and my options were to stay in my home state (with no family there anymore), move to Florida, move to CO, or get a job in a completely random state where I don’t know anybody at all. I would rather scoop my eyes out with a melon baller than live in Florida, and my brother was really insistent on me moving to CO to be closer to him. So, I applied for a bunch of teaching jobs and got one! With this job, I live 2 hours away from my brother (which isn’t super close, but it’s way better than the 17 hours away he was before). So I packed up my life and moved across the country. 

I have been here for a little over 4 months, and I love my job. It’s a great position, where I am doing exactly what I wanted to do. The kids are great, and it’s extremely rewarding (although exhausting too). But besides my job, I am so sad and alone.

I have a boyfriend, and we are doing long distance as he has another year until he graduates. I miss him so badly it’s agonizing. 

I have no friends, not for lack of trying. I’ve tried to make friends with other teachers at school, but they always say they’re busy when I ask to grab drinks or get coffee after work. I joined several facebook groups to make friends, and everybody I have tried talking to has ghosted me after a couple of weeks. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. I don’t think I’m being weird, and I’m not being overly pushy or anything. I’ve even shown my messages to my boyfriend and he doesn’t see anything wrong with them. People just don’t like me, I  guess. I can’t figure out why. I’m naturally an introvert, but I’ve been trying so hard to out myself out there and be friendly and positive with new interactions. It never works out. 

And the biggest kicker is this: shortly after moving here, my brother changed his work schedule so his two days off are mid-week. I can’t ever see him now, since I’m a teacher and I have weekends off. He lives two hours away from me, and I can’t just drive there and back on a school night. I visited him soon after I moved here, before school started, and I also visited him during my fall break. That is twice in the four months I’ve been here, and he has not made any attempt to visit me. Why the fuck did he pressure me to move here if he doesn’t even want to see me? 

I love my job, but I am so sad and lonely. The one person who makes me happy lives 17 hours away from me, and I have to wait until May when he graduates and can move here to live with me.  I see him every couple of months when we can afford plane tickets to visit each other, but it’s not enough. And for the rest of the time, I am alone. The only people I regularly interact with are the children I teach. It’s pathetic. I have two dogs, and they help, but it’s not the same as having friends and doing things together.

We were living together before the move and everything was great between us. I thought she would eventually move to be with me but as 6 years passed by, it never happened and the same reasons still exist mainly her aging mother. So I  don’t realistically see us being together in the next five years. 

We are seeing each other sporadically and less and less as each year goes by. I find myself calling her more than her calling me and when we do see each other it’s me that makes the effort to travel.  I find myself often feeling lonely.  I cherish the friendship we have and have warm memories of us together. If she was here with me it would be an easy decision. We get along effortlessly and it is just real good. We are friends first and foremost.

In the mean time, I met a great lady at my gym. She is friendly, fit and very attractive. We began chatting daily and went to coffee one day and the conversation was good. She’s a quality person and I could see myself with her. We have since gone on several dates and our communication level has picked up and I can tell she is very interested in me. Nothing sexual has occurred and I have not even tried.

My dilemma is what to do. I’m starting to feel massively guilty as I feel I’m cheating or monkey branching. I love and respect my long distance partner but my needs aren’t being met and I don’t see that result changing. I don’t won’t to lose her and the friendship we have. I think it is special and rare atleast for me. 

The new girl is great and I can see myself in an everyday romantic relationship with her with the added benefit of her being present everyday in my life. 

What to do? Obviously I need to decide and end one of them. Any advice?

Update: I know this post will generate a lot of your a cheater sentiment. I do feel guilty and I’m not looking for that perspective. I guess I’m looking for a debate or logical reasons to help me think through what would be the best decision.

1gsw1il,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1gsw1il/long_distance_never_thought_i_could_feel_these_way/,Long distance never thought I could feel these way ❤️,"I love my partner too much we have been in a long distance relationship for a year and a month ago he came to see me when I saw him I didn’t feel butterflies or nerves but I felt at home and at peace. I felt like I already knew him. When my boyfriend cries I can’t help crying and when he is sick or when I remember moments of suffering from him I cry just as much. When he gave me my first kiss I will never forget it was at the skating rink it was my first kiss and it was wonderful after the first kiss I could not stop I wanted to kiss him more and more. When he kissed me I felt how wet I got. I wanted to hug him and never let go when he left it was hard but I knew I would see him again. My family said a lot of negative things but I didn’t let him and I defended him. With him I have told him my biggest secrets and there is nothing I can’t tell him. I write him poems and songs.

For the first time in my life I felt jealousy a day ago and it was a very strange thing for me. I with him did what I said I would not do and that was to have a moment in the movies me and him it was risky but it was wonderful. I cried and looked him in the eyes and hugged him. I told him to forgive me for having doubts whether I loved him or not and he hugged me and looking into my eyes he told me that nothing was wrong that he knew I loved him and I told him how do you know and he said I see it in your eyes. When he left it hurt too much and I cried a lot waiting for him to come back. I was sad that I could not be with him again on Saturday.

I remembered the moments when we went to eat tacos and he got his hands dirty and I cleaned them, when we ordered those pistachio and triple chocolate ice creams and he didn’t like the pistachio and I tried to take away the pistachio flavor and give him only chocolate. I remembered when I gave him food in his mouth, kissed him, hugged him and how my smile was big and intact. I am not a person who smiles a lot but with him it was impossible not to smile. I felt like taking his hand and never let go. I love to admire him when he is doing something I try to memorize every corner of his face as a work of art. I love when our eyes meet and we smile at each other and he tells me ? and laughs and I swim and laugh. I can’t help but think of him most of the time and always when I pass places I know he likes I say so. When he graduated I wish I could have been there even if I wasn’t there watching him grab his hard earned degree made me cry. Sometimes I have feelings in my heart that I don’t know how to explain.

This is my first relationship and it will be my only one. Sometimes I feel something warm in my heart that comes and goes. If I could make one wish it would be to be together forever and ever. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for him even if it was giving my life or taking a bullet for him. I know that many people say that a Capricorn is cold and unfeeling but I feel that when we fall in love we are totally devoted to this love we feel. I know his favorite food, I know his favorite snack, I know how he likes his coffee and the brand of coffee he likes. I will never forget Nestlé dolce coffee. I dream of a white house with flowers and peace. Me and him together living our life next to each other and the other with two children a beautiful and cute family. I don’t know anyone’s birthday but my siblings, my own and a cousin. However, I don’t forget his day. I had doubts at the beginning if what I felt was love or if I was in love with him in the end I think it was just my fears because he only needs to take my heart and give it to him. There is nothing I would not do for him and there is nothing I want in this life if it is not with him.",0,1731788431.0,AskMenOver30,1,0.25,False

When a woman is in love she makes herself known to you she looks for any opportunity to be able to talk to you or get close to you. 
When a woman is truly interested she listens to you attentively and learns the things you like and dislike. 
When a woman loves you she even learns your favorite gummies and your favorite cookies.
When a woman loves you she learns how you like your coffee and what your favorite food is.
A woman who truly loves you makes you her priority before anyone else.
When a woman truly loves you she does special things for you whether it's on special days or not. 
When a woman truly loves you she becomes like a second mother without being a mother she cares about your well being whether you ate how was your day how do you feel and what do you think about when you are serious.
When a woman truly loves you it's not just words but actions. When a woman really loves you she will do things for you without you having to ask her, things as simple as putting food in your mouth. Caress your hand. Clean your hand when it gets dirty. Help you with something when you need it etc. 
when a woman loves you you will be her inspiration for whatever she does. 
When a woman loves you there is no greater work of art than your face and she can look at you like no other.

When a woman loves you she answers you, she is there for you. 
When a woman loves you there is no doubt because a woman who truly loves her partner is capable of bringing down the sky and the stars just for you to admire them and she lets you know it. 
When a woman truly loves you, she compliments you and smiles at every single one of them. 
When a woman really loves you no matter the situation she is there for you with money or without money with health or without health. 
When a woman truly loves you there are no limits in waiting for her great love for you.
When a woman truly loves you she doesn't care if it hurts her fingers to write you poetry, a letter or a drawing because love is bigger than the keys in her hands. 
When a woman truly loves you she becomes a little girl who can show who she really is, she giggles and smiles all the time.
When a woman truly loves you you will know it because there is no comparison in dealing with anyone else.

I'm confused about what products to use. I've Googled, I've read the Martha Steward book, and I know what my mother used ages ago, but I still feel like I need help with this. For example, I've been using Pledge on everything that is wood, and I'm pretty sure that is wrong. I also have used what I saw on the internet to clean my steel sink -- vinegar and baking soda -- and I seen on the housekeeping sub that that is apparently a ridiculous combo of products? Apparently Murphy's Oil Soap is not what I should be doing for floors? I've literally been using paper towels with Pledge on lampshades because I have zero understanding of what products actually grab dust. Help?! 

Please be kind -- I grew up without much support in a fairly dirty house which is why I never learned this stuff. 

What should I be using for:

Bathroom: Shower, Sink, Toilet, floor

Kitchen: Counters, Stainless steel sink, Refrigerator inside/out, Oven, Top of range (electric) -- all parts of it, microwave 

Furniture: Wood dining table, coffee table, wooden cabinets and side tables, glass table top, upholstered couch, leather chair, upholstered bed

Floors: hardwood, tile, rugs

Other: dusty lamp shades, dust on ceiling fans, walls, glass windows and mirrors, bath mats, sink drains, blinds, whatever else I'm surely forgetting

1gsvxgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1gsvxgc/cpap_feels_lovecraftian_good/,CPAP feels lovecraftian (good!),"Basically, ""mild"" sleep apnea case here, but low blood oxygen levels on my home study. Initially, the doctors didn't want to provide PAP, but the flow resistance was so high that decided to give it a chance.

I am struggling a bit to sleep with it throughout the night, but-
WHAT THE FUCK. WHAT THE FUCK.

Ever-present pessimism? Gone. Emotional regulation is so much better. Empathy is much more pronounced, and reading other people feels a fuckton easier. It's like my brain is acutely sensitive to picking up tone.
I have depth perception!
I no longer crave sweets and coffee all the time!
Music feels much more rewarding.
I rarely forget ordinary words anymore.
My sensory issues are really subdued!
I've been able and felt compelled to kick my habit of playing predatory mobile/online games (though I did not have a serious addiction)
I can actually be... up most of the day without having to lie down and rest!
I CAN LEARN NEW THINGS AND RETAIN INFORMATION???? 


Granted, I did hit a serious REM-rebound, but even in a very sleepy state, things feel much more ""right"".

Two weeks in, I feel like the person I was before CPAP is someone completely different. And I say that going several nights in a row on only six hours or less with the mask.

Granted, I believe I've had  OSA for over 10+ years, and I also think my hypoxia has been really really bad for a while, but please give CPAP a solid try. Everyone's experience will be different, but this condition can absolutely ruin your life. I 100% feel like I've dodged a bullet!

1gsvur0,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1gsvur0/logical_explanation/,Logical explanation?,"Hi. Long one, sorry in advance. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 months now. We moved in together pretty early on in the relationship, since I was working two jobs, paying rent and all that jazz that was just exhausting. I'm also a part time student. 

Now, two side notes. I have tattoos. Like 15 of them. All of them are memories and tributes I cherish a lot, and I love each and every one of them. I also dropped out of university last year, and then enrolled again changing my bachelor. I'm in year two now.

He let me know very early on that his parents were very against tattoos, so I asked him to please let them know in advance about mine so we don't get into an icky situation. And he did - his mother promised to not bring it up. 

I met his mother in August. We were already living together for two months when that happened, and the only reason I took two whole months to meet her was because I had the worst gut feeling... Rightfully so as proven later.

When I met her, the first topic of conversation were my tattoos. She asked me who advised me on getting those done. I said I make my own decisions. She asked me how I feel about other people not wanting to see them. I said I didn't care. She said that's not too good. 

Then university was brought up. I explained what the situation was. She wasn't too happy about it. All that happened in the span of 30 minutes. The other hour and half were spent without her talking to me. I broke down about it later at home, and my boyfriend was very understanding and supporting. To be fair, when she chewed me up and spit me out, he didn't just watch. He shut her up.

Months passed by with little accidents here and there, and my complete refusal to see her or talk to her. Once, she called him and was angry at him because he hadn't called for three days while she was sick. He didn't even know there was a health concern. Another time, she would call him and angrily ask when would he be home alone, knowing very well we live together. All that lead to a huge conversation between them with boundaries being set. He explained she doesn't have to like me as a person, but she has to respect me as his partner. Fair enough. Apparently one of the biggest problems she had with me was me changing my bachelor, lol. 

Fast forward to this Friday. I had an exam in the morning, but the thing is - between the last time I saw her and today, I quit my job. It was a decision me and my boyfriend made together, as I wanted to focus on my studies and we figured it's a dynamic that works for us. On another note, whenever he would visit his parents I'd send them something sweet I've baked, and even made his dad's birthday cake. Also, he wants to spend Christmas with my family in my hometown (my mama is the sweetest person alive, and they get along perfectly).

So, said Friday I had an exam, and his parents were supposed to visit so they could use the shower - health related, doesn't matter. We specifically scheduled it in a way that would prevent me from seeing them. However, I finished my exam super quick and early, and they were late, and I was cold... So I called my grandma who advised me to put my big girl pants on and go home. I did. I met his dad, super funny guy, made them coffee, was civil. Apart from the fact that she would call me a nickname she knows very well I despise - though she dropped it, after i made it clear I'm not having it - she also brought up Christmas. 

She told me boyfriend Christmas is a family holiday. He reminded her she knew about his Christmas plans way in advance. They took it to another room, and as far as I'm aware, she repeatedly told him Christmas is a family thing, and finally shut up when he asked, and I quote, ""I'm aware it's a family thing, what do you think she is time?""

Anyways. After that conversation all was normal, we even had a proper discussion about politics and stuff, she was kind and I even got a kiss goodbye on the cheek, lol... I guess what I'm wondering is, what's her point? Should I expect her to be a pain in the future as well? What do I do? Thank you in advance guys, y'all are so precious.
