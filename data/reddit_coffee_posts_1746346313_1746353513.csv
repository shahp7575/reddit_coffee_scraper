1kegen1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kegen1/people_wont_stop_staring_at_me/,People won't stop staring at me,"Sometimes people are so lost in thought that they don’t realize they are staring directly at something or someone. I guess it’s not staring at, but rather through. However, I knew something was wrong when I left my home a couple of days ago, and noticed several people staring straight at me.

It started about eight days ago. I remember a woman and her daughter shopping at my local supermarket. The mother, middle-aged, with hair tied in a ponytail, was looking at the nutritional values on the back of a box of granola, probably searching for the healthiest alternative to the sugary cereal we all loved dearly when we were younger. I didn’t think much of it. They seemed like a normal, day-to-day family. I distinctly remember the bored look on the little girl’s face, which shifted into an eerie, emotionless stare as I walked by. Both their gazes seemed to follow me along the aisle. To say this was unnerving is an understatement. Just as quickly as it had happened, they both seemed to snap out of it. The entire ordeal lasted no longer than five seconds, but the feeling of unease clung to me like a shadow for the remainder of the day. Reflecting on the past week, everything seems so obvious. Strange things happen all the time—things we can’t explain. But life moves too fast to stop and question them. This was no exception.

The second strange incident happened about 30 minutes later. When I got on the bus home, it felt as if some of the passengers shifted from whatever they were occupied with, to staring straight into my eyes. At first, a wave of embarrassment washed over me. Did I forget to zip my pants? Was I wearing my shirt inside out? There had to be a reason as to why, on multiple occasions, these people abruptly stopped what they were doing to make eye contact with me.

But it wasn’t the staring that unsettled me. It was the stillness.

A man on the phone completely ceased his animated movements. His hand hung suspended in the air, frozen in place. The rustling of an elderly woman searching for something in her purse halted. They seemed stuck like a broken cog jamming a machine. If not for their blank faces, I might have expected a grunt or some sign of strain. Instead, I was met with stoic expressions. At least three or four of them, watching me. Blank faces. Empty eyes.

I got off at the next stop.

I had never felt so paranoid in my life. One incident could be written off. But after the bus, I knew something was wrong. It’s human nature to try to rationalize the unexplainable, to give meaning to the meaningless. But what happens when nothing fits? What do we become when our attempts to reason fail us?

Upon arriving home, I spent some time online, looking for any possible explanation as to what had happened. Absence Seizures, Sleep paralysis, Catatonia, Locked-In Syndrome... All involve paralysis, but none fit. None explain why, twice, in two different places, I seemed to be the only constant. I looked on forums for other people experiencing the same thing, but my questions remained unanswered. This frustrated me. I refused to believe this was something that had never happened before. I examined my clothes, my body, my face—nothing out of the ordinary. Besides a small stain on my shirt, I looked like everyone else. It had to be fatigue or a daydream. At least that’s what I tried telling myself.

I was fine with lying to myself until the burning incident.

I’ve always been a coffee person. Every morning before work, I stop by my favorite spot for a cup of delicious filter coffee. By now, I had completely forgotten about the events of the day before. The shop was empty, save for some remote workers and newspaper-reading regulars. The smell of freshly brewed coffee emanated from behind the counter, and as always, I was looking forward to a large Americano, little sugar, no milk. The barista took my order. I added an extra slice of banana bread. After all, it was my cheat day, and I wanted to enjoy my conversation with the employee a little longer. If coffee wasn’t enough to wake me up, I’m sure her smile would. It was shaping up to be a good day. Cold, but sunny. I didn’t have time for any more introspection. Insufficient space for my mood to lift. I believe this was the last time I was happy. My thoughts were interrupted by the sizzling sound of hot liquid on burning flesh.

When I looked up, I saw dark streaks of coffee trickling down the counter. A black puddle began to form at my feet. It took me a couple of seconds to recompose and shift my attention to the source of the unsettling burning noise. I saw the barista’s wrist, covered in freshly forming blisters. Steam rose from the pores of her skin, Americano forming a pool underneath her hand. Everything about this situation felt wrong. There was no scream. The hand was not jerked from underneath the hot stream. No coffee pot was leveled, ending the self-inflicted torment. The only sign of pain was the faint trembling of her burned hand. The barista’s dimpled smile had been replaced by a blank stare, just inches from my face. A single tear formed at the corner of her eye and slowly trickled down her cheek. 

No blinking, no movement, no screams. Not until I had turned and fled the coffee shop as fast as I could. Only then I was met with the most excruciating scream I had ever heard.

This event shattered me. Whatever was happening, it was connected to me. It only happened when I was present—and ceased the moment I left. This meant more questions. How could my presence trigger spasms or freeze someone’s motor skills? I’d never heard of anything like this before, and I doubted it was even possible. Was I infected with a virus? Had I completely lost my mind? I began to question reality. For all I know I could be in a coma and this could all be one big dream. I decided that from here on out, I would only leave my house if I was left with no other choice. I couldn’t endanger anyone if they weren't around in the first place.

The rest of that day was spent scouring the internet, hoping to find something—anything—that could help me understand what was happening. The only break I allowed myself was to watch the local evening news, curious if anything was mentioned about what had happened earlier.

To my surprise, nothing was mentioned about the entire ordeal. The local news anchor, Fred Baker, opened with a piece about teenagers vandalizing cars. Naturally, the kids were stupid enough to key the cars of their teachers, which made it easy for authorities to find the culprits. Both were expelled and would face severe punishment at home, according to an angry mother being interviewed.

I found myself drifting off. The events of the past two days had taken their toll on me, and my body was finally paying the price.

I woke up to complete silence.

The soft light from the TV illuminated the room, suggesting I had slept for quite some time. Perhaps I had accidentally muted the audio by rolling on the remote. The jingles of what should have been commercials were now replaced by an eerie silence. The only distinguishable sound was the faint passing of cars in the distance. When I stared at the screen, I saw Fred Baker’s face staring back at me. At first, I wondered what had happened to my TV. Why was the image frozen? It must have been a loose cable or a network glitch. I’ve always been keen on details, and that day was no different. As I got up to investigate, I noticed something odd. The image wasn’t frozen at all.

At first, I thought I had imagined it. But as I brought my face closer to the screen to inspect Fred’s image, my suspicions were confirmed. Just barely visible, easily overlooked by most, Fred’s left eyelid slowly twitched. I firmly believe that if the other incidents hadn’t occurred, I would have missed this, and would have just unplugged my TV. I wish I'd turned off this cursed broadcast before he started speaking to me.

This is what Fred Baker, the face of Winsdale Local News Network, said to me before exchanging his suspended, forced state for a lifeless one.

“Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in hell. And then all the souls of the damned will wail when they see the Son of Man descending into the fiery pits, with torment and great wrath.”

Now, I am not a religious man, and I wouldn’t know where to start looking for the source of these words. I do not believe that it was Fred Baker speaking. I don’t even know what it was. But I’m certain it was aimed at me. It was meant for my ears only. And it frustrates me that, to this day, I have no idea what to make of this. Was it a warning, or a threat?

This is the moment in my timeline when I decided to cut myself off from any possible human interaction. No more chats, live TV, online gaming—nothing that could put another person at risk. It became clear that whatever was happening, I would have to figure it out on my own. This also meant that my previous theory about needing to be close to a person to trigger this suspended, staring state was useless. Still, it was also the first time one of the people afflicted by this strange condition had done anything other than stare at me in their frozen state.

The lack of information was suffocating. I was left alone with my thoughts, my notes, and hundreds of browser tabs ranging from biblical to demonic possession, mass psychosis, biological warfare, and other desperate topics. I didn’t want to leave a single stone unturned. As you might start to realize by now, it was all in vain. I wouldn't be writing this if I had found a solution, or received any help from the outside world.

This morning, I realized that the distant sound of cars had stopped.

After being cooped up inside for six days, you notice the slightest changes in your surroundings. Certain noises and images become part of your routine, so it didn’t take long for me to detect this subtle shift. There was something else, too. The light didn’t fall on my sheets the same way it usually did. There was a slight bend in the ray of sunshine streaming through my blinds. Deep down, I knew what was about to happen. Denial could only go so far. I’d been a fool to believe I could hide inside my home. Stupid to think everything that was happening would stop if I stayed inside. I got out of bed and slowly reached for the blind cord. There was no point in delaying the inevitable. I pulled it hard, exposing myself to the sun’s rays, only to find them blocked by the silhouette of a man.

It was my neighbor.

His face was only inches from the window. The same emotionless expression. Unmoving. I remember calling out to him, asking if he was okay. I already had the answers to these questions. His eyes were bloodshot, and I couldn’t look into them for more than a second before having to look away. I don’t know how long we stood there. Me, paralyzed by fear. Jim was trapped by whatever force had taken control of his body. It felt like we would stand there for eternity, or at least until our bodies succumbed to the stress. Staring into the dead eyes of Jim Freeman was a battle I couldn’t win. I only managed to snap out of this paralysis because the corners of his mouth tilted upward, revealing a twisted, hollow smile that didn’t belong.

He's been standing there for hours now. Others have joined him as well. It’s only a matter of days before they surround the house. Sometimes I swear I hear them crying. Or is it laughing? I don’t know. I could be selfish. I could run and try to put as much distance between them and me as possible. But what if these things follow me? What if I bring this horrible curse upon someone else? I can't let that happen. This leaves me with two other options. The second one I’d rather not discuss. My final option is to face them. Face the puppets that have been haunting me for the past eight days. I don’t think any help is coming. My calls to emergency services seem to get intercepted by something. Silence on the other end of the line. If the people around you suddenly stop moving, if they only stare at you—please, don’t let them surround you.",1,1746353307.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I just had a brain fart today and the concept of latency is stuck in my brain with economics. 
My observation is that in countries like Australia where resources and users are dispersed across a massive landmass (space) there is a significant latency in economic activities occurring with the exchange of goods and services.

In a smaller space economic activity can occur at lower latencies. I reckon this is what we see with Digitization and online economic activity.

Is there any definition of latency in relation to economics ?.
Any use of the concept of latency with economic theory ?

1kegcj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1kegcj3/sustained_high_bg_at_night/,Sustained high BG at night,"So my other posts in the diabetes sub got banned for asking for medical advice. I don't see that rule here, but either way I'm not asking for medical advice. Well, I don't think I am. Anyway, got out of a hospital stay for DKA two days ago and tryna get the hang of everything. Diagnosed type 1, unless the upcoming antibody test says otherwise. But they pretty much said I'm type 1. I'm mostly staying in the normal ranges, but at night I've been going up to 200, sometimes 3 and staying there till I go to bed. Then I wake up around 90 or so.

For now I've been eating bacon and eggs for breakfast, salad/veggies with chicken for lunch, and either chicken and brocolli for dinner, or some other meat. And I have some natural PB and apple slices for snacks, or hard boiled eggs. I'm doing 3 fast acting shots at 5 units for each of my three main meals, and 16 units of lantus once a night. Only other thing is I drink half a pot of coffee in the morning/afternoon w creamer and stevia, and decaf tea w stevia at night. Otherwise just drinking water. I'm kind of a night owl with a weird-ish work schedule, so I haven't totally locked in a firm sched for the meals/shots, though I plan to of course. This week I'm just kinda goin easy on myself, before I dig in, etc. But regardless, taking them roughly the same times every day.

Last thing is I seem to be peeing a lot again today. The DKA had me peeing constantly obviously. Then for the last two days I felt back to normal. Now tonight I've been going frequently and its making me kinda nervous. Is that just a thing at higher BG levels? Some posts pretty much say thats a thing/the case, but I'm also still confused by a lot, and some stuff is hard to lock down.

Anyway, any obvious wrongdoing on my part so far, generally speaking? Just any tips on the lifestyle/eating habits that can lead to a more balanced BG? I'm definitely googling a lot of stuff, and taking notes for my upcoming doc visits, but I'd like to get some of you guys' thoughts regardless.

Handcuffed to the Venbig, Lmur is going on a little trip whether he wants it or not.

**NOTE:** As I’ve developed the story behind Brkar, some things I’ve said in the comment section no longer hold true.  We’ll see how it all evolves.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Memory transcription subject: Lmur, Yotul Flame**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

It was weird.

Brkar was easily the biggest, scariest Venlil I had ever seen, and here he was, wagging his tail like a pup.  That thing almost flattened me every now and then.  I actually had to parkour vault over it, *twice.*  Could almost swear he was *aiming* it at me.

So, what was he so happy about?

Just … *walking,* under the twilight sky, taking the time to soak in any and everything. Oh, and he was moving very, *very* slowly, and it was driving me *crazy.*  I suppose it was a scenic route, pretty lonely too.  The few who passed us stared a little.  He’d forced me to ditch my uniform, which made me look like a perp, cuffed and being arrested by a Venlil officer, who happened to be kaiju-sized.  Who wouldn’t take a gander? Of course, his stolen guild uniform dissuaded any real challenge to our presence.  The Humans sure liked to take photos, though …

*^(“#Venbig!”)* I heard someone snicker for the hundredth time today.

Brkar tossed them a smirk before stopping to stare at a flower that- y’know what?  Honestly, I didn’t care what it was or why he found it so interesting.  This was boring.  *Physically painful* levels of boring.  With a little less subtlety than I’d exercised before, I pulled out Marjinl’s pad.

***“AHA!”*** he barked, snatching the pad from my paws.  “I *knew* it felt like you were sneaking something!  Huh, wow … you’ve sent a *lot* of messages.  I patted you down three times.  It’s a small pad, but how did you hide this?”

“Prestidigitation, *obviously,”* I groaned.

He began typing what I presumed to be a misleading message to throw off the Flames.  “Uh, no. Seriously, where have you been hiding this?”

I tried to look as awkwardly uncomfortable as possible.

He scrunched his muzzle and made one more tap on the pad (sending the message, probably?).  Then he hurled it as far as he could before beckoning me closer and wiping off his paws on my uniform.  I made a big show of squirming and squealing.

“Please settle down.  That’s annoying,” he stated.

“Brkar, why are you so incredibly *mean?”* I whined.

“I don’t even know what you’re whining about,” he shrugged, roughing up my fur as he transferred every possible germ onto my person.  “You had no qualms about touching the cursed pad earlier.”

*Huh.*  That wasn’t fair.  Big, thuggish bad guys were supposed to be dumb.

“That doesn’t mean I want your *grimy paws* all over me!” I squealed.

He pressed a finger to my lips.  *“Shush.*  Not so loud.”

*Woooooooooow.* This ***jerk.***

With that, he went back to staring at his flower.

…

Scratches multiplied to the dozens.  He didn’t move.

I began thumping my foot.  “How long do you need to stare at a flower?”

His eyes slid towards me at an agonisingly slow rate.  An incremental smile lifted his muzzle before his glacial gaze returned to the flower.

Fine.  I’d wait him out.  Maybe he was doing this to annoy me, but there was no way he’d keep it up forever.  I’d outlast him, even if it brought me down to my last shred of sanity.

\------------

*37 minutes later …*

\------------

Yip … *yippp … yipfpap̶̺̈́ǒ̵̖a̴̰͊* … heh heh … *funn̷̢̦̓y̴̺̌͐ braa̵á̵͈i̴͚͗̚in soun̷d̴ḍ̷͒̽dd* …… wait, what just happened?  I think I … *lost it* for a moment there?

And Brkar still hadn’t moved a hair.

Some undignified whines escaped my muzzle.  “Look, man, I get that you’re a shut-in, or whatever, but I have terminal ADHD, and if we don’t get moving, like, *last paw*, ***I’m going insane and I’m taking you with me!”***

*“Hmmmmmmmm …”* he hummed for far too long.  “I’m genuinely curious as to what that would look like.  Go ahead.”

And so I did.

I started with an attempt to gnaw off my wrist and free myself from the cuffs.  He laughed at me.  I’ll admit I flew off the rails after that, but my wrath was just!  He’d done enough, to me, to my herd, to those jerks he’d pummeled from the other squads!  I owed it to them all to trounce him there and then.

I whirled into the air, flinging my tail for that extra oomph at the end of my kantu kick.

My foot bounced right off his skull.

I returned to the ground, landed on that tree trunk tail of his that just *happened* to get in the way.  Slipped.  Fell.  My head hit the-

It diidn’t hurt.  *Obviously,* but thaAt kantu kick left me just a little dizzYy.

“That was pretty good,” I nodded appreciatively, “but … did you seriously just knock yourself out?”

No answer.  He was in [that](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/553/548/512.png) position, which almost made me whistle.  It suggested a genuine lack of consciousness.  Still, I wasn’t sure if I bought it.

I stooped before him.  “Y’know, faking unconsciousness is a *great* way to make me look like a bad guy.  Some PD giant carrying around a limp Yotul’s gonna draw some stares.  Did you do this on purpose?  A silent cry for help?  It’s pretty smart, I’ll admit.  But here’s the thing … *I don’t buy it.”*

Lifting one of his eyelids, I found his gaze looked pretty glazed, but the pupils didn’t seem dilated enough.

I grinned into his face.  “Alright.  Tell you what: I’m gonna punch you.  If you’re not unconscious, just yip and we can move on.  If you keep quiet, well, it’s lights out for real this time.”

No reaction.

*“One … two …* ***THREE.”***

I threw my fist forward, stopping a wool’s length from his muzzle.

Not a flinch.

I sat back on my haunches with a sigh, patting him on the head.  “Either you’re a *really* good actor, or I’m really gonna have to carry you.  Eh, that’s okay.  I had plans in place, in case something like this ever-“

I raised an ear.  Footsteps.  Thanks to my genetics, I could hear most species long before they could hear me, but these individuals had gotten pretty close.  I must have been rusty.

Undoing my suit, just a little, I snatched a small bottle out of my wool.

*‘Night Side,’* read the label.

It was one of Venlilkind’s strongest beverages, capable of cleaning wounds almost as well as any surgical alcohol.  I hadn’t really cared to used it that day.  My immune system was as monstrous as I was.  Besides, bodily maintenance didn’t matter much to me when I wasn’t planning to stick around for the long haul.

However, it had another premeditated purpose.

I doused him in the beverage, stashed away the bottle and fixed up my uniform.

**“Hey!”** came a bray.  **“What are you doing to that primitive?”**

I feigned innocent confusion as I looked towards the voice.  Two Venlil women.  Not exactly run-of-the-mill.   At first glance, I’d thought my accuser was wearing dark arm sleeves and stockings.  Some kind of punky goth look.  Then I realised she’d simply dyed her fur black in some areas.  Her head wool was styled like a short bobcut with an ombre fade from black to white at the tips.   Hm.  Creative.  She was on the short side when it came to Venlil.  Couldn’t be more than 4’2”.

Her friend’s vibe was the polar opposite.  At 5’4” or so, most would consider her tall, though not by my standards.  Her fluffy-cloud wool was dyed pink.  It looked like cotton candy, and honestly, it was making me hungry.  Human influence must have pushed these Venlil to try novel fashion statements.

Oh, and she was wagging her tail like mad, while visibly *trying* to make it look ladylike.  Her ears were turning orange.  It was flattering, to be honest.

I adjusted my ‘scary’, default voice to sound as normal as possible.

*“‘Poor primitive’?”* I quoted wearily.  “Look, I know what you guys say about the Yotul, but I don’t appreciate you speaking of my friend in this manner.”

She sputtered at the unexpected Uno Reverse.  Oh, how I loved conversational Judo.

“D-don’t think this is over!  I *know* you!” she stuttered, attempting to sound brave.

I slowly flicked an ear.  How far was she gonna push this?  Conflicts with non-combatants left a bad taste in my mouth.

“Y-you’re that ‘Venbig’ whose all over Forrest!” she declared.

Oh.  Social media.  Okay.

*“… So?”* I deadpanned.

“So, the Yotul was walking with you a quarter claw ago, and now he’s unconscious!” she bleated.  “How do you explain that, *huh?*  Also, ***what’s with the handcuffs?”***

I rolled my eyes.  “Long story short, he wanted to see my handcuffs and tried to play a little prank.  Threw away the keys and said we were ‘Chained-Together Buddies’, whatever that means.  Surprise surprise, we couldn’t find the keys after his little stunt, so we’re headed to meet a guy I know who’s good with this sort of thing.  Then there was that *one bottle* of Night Side, and now he’s wasted.”

She glared.  “That’s sus as- *ack!  Gack!”* she gagged as the scent presumably hit her tastebuds.  “Sweet stars, that really *is* Night Side, *hack!”*

“Yep,” I bleated, scooping up Lmur bridal-style.  “Now, if you lovely ladies will excuse me, we best be going lest I get into even more with the guild.”

“… Your uniform doesn’t fit …” Little Miss Detective muttered in the final dredges of suspicion.

“Yes.  It was made for a Takkan,” I explained simply.  “Do you really think they make uniforms in my size?”

“I … w-well …” she stammered.

“You fill it out just fine in my book,” bloomed the pink Venlil.

The nosy one shot her a look.  \*“\**^(Kansee??  What are you doing???”)*

^(“Shush, Rrish. I’m cooking,”) whispered ‘Kansee’, before fluffing her wool playfully.  “Look me up on Forest: you’ll find me under ‘CottonKansee’.”

‘Rrish’ seemed about ready to pass out.

“Or better yet, come find me at-“

Rrish slapped a paw over her muzzle.  “Sorry to bother you, Sir!  I hope you have a wonderful paw!”

I strode past them with a polite ear-flick.  Miss Nosey gave me a wide berth.

*“Likewise,”* I cooed lowly.

Now, Kansee was the one who looked ready to pass out.

As soon as they probably *thought* I was out of earshot, Miss Frosty lit into her pink friend.

“What is *wrong* with you?!” Rrish bleated.  “That’s gotta be the biggest, *scariest* Venlil I’ve ever seen!”

“I *knoooow,* right?*”* Kansee mewled.  “Did you hear his voice?  It was *deeeeeep,* like, *Human,* deep!  And da muscles!  *Ohhhh,* ***dem muscles!”***

*“He could snap you in half!”* hissed Rrish.

“I *know,* right??” Kansee squeaked giddily.

Rrish brayed in dismay.

\*\*“\*\****Ooh!***  Rrish!  This is *perfect!”* Kansee suddenly bleated.  “I need you to get past your silly sensibilities and help me write a new song!  [Bocchi vibes! ](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-AlTxReObBJzvn0T9BV8FXWMCy_ZII6S?si=vlMZg1YmTPUl3Ggs)Channel the *Bocchi vibes!”*

“NO!” Rrish spat.

“Just hear me out, okay?” Kansee began.

**“I ain’t hearing you out!”** Rrish bugled.

At this point, I don’t think they cared whether or not I could hear them.

“‘T’was Beauty that killed the Beast’,” Kansee quoted.

*“… Wut?”* Rrish deadpanned.

“There is *nothing* more irresistible than a sweet little flowerbird of a girl meeting a wild, shadestalker man,” Kansee swooned.

“Well, you *are* something of a flowerbird …” Rrish supposed.

*“Rrishhhh!*  I don’t like it when you imply that I’m *stupiddd!”* Kansee whined.

**“I don’t like it when you’re** ***being*** **stupid!”** Rrish brayed.

**“Get off yer high horse, gurl!”** Kansee finally brayed back.  **“We share the same pad!  I’ve seen your search history!  95% of your diet consists of some** ***ice-cold duke*** **with** ***the exact same face!”***

Chocking back the whistles, I almost dropped Lmur.

Rrish went real quiet for the next few scratches.  Then the braying continued.  I’d just passed the threshold where their words blurred to incoherence.  It would take a special kind of Venlil to hear what they were saying.

I strained my ears.  Dad was meeting *That Guy* again.

Best Feast was in full swing, but I couldn’t care less about the sumptuous scents passing over my tastebuds … okay, maybe I could care.  As a pup in a perpetual growth spurt, I was always hungry on some level.  I was pretty full as it was, yet my tongue kept dragging me back for more.  We had our own, private culinary arts that outdid pretty much anything The Federation had to offer.  Nothing beat Best Feast.

Fine.

I’d eat a little more.  That made it look like I *wasn’t* trying to eavesdrop on their conversation

Sifting through dozens of voices at once was hard enough, but Dad seemed to know *exactly* the distance required to make it impossible for me to hear him.

I was trying to read his lips when he glanced at me, playfully flicked an ear and turned away.

***Ugh.***  The worst part was that I *knew* they were talking about me.  It made me feel like some kind of exotic pet, trotted out for show.  If only I could-

Wait.

My gaze was passing Rebra when she fluttered an ear to get my attention.  My eyes drifted to her muzzle as she seemed to say something, but not a sound came out of her.

*‘Can you read lips?’* she mouthed.

I flicked my ear.

She smirked and discreetly angled an ear towards Dad and That Guy.

*‘… full size, he’ll be able to tear an Arxur apart with his bare paws,’* she mouthed.

I tried to suppress my delight.  It figured.  Those big ears of hers weren’t just for emoting.  Maybe my attempts to listen in were more obvious than I’d thought, or Rebra was just that sharp.  In any case, I tried my best to look inconspicuous as I watched her muzzle form silent words.  It wasn’t hard to figure out who said what.

That Guy: *‘Arxur stand at \[8 feet\] tall.  Is he gonna grow that big?’*

Dad: *‘No.  His full height should max out at around \[6’ 3”\].’*

That Guy: *‘Big, but not Arxur big.’*

Dad: *‘It doesn’t have to be when the muscles are ‘built different’.’*

That Guy: *‘It won’t matter if he doesn’t know how to fight.  How are you training him?’*

Dad: *‘A proprietary form of advanced E.A.T., blended with … other things.’*

That Guy: *‘That won’t be enough.  You’ve buried your head in the earth of a different species so long that you don’t know the natural benefits of Venlilkind.  Look at this …’*

Was he showing Dad something?  I tried to keep my eyes on Rebra’s muzzle, while stealing glances at the two.  That Guy had balled his paw into a fist, swinging it around sloppily.

That Guy: *‘Doesn’t this look silly on a Venlil?  Punches are for primates and Feddies who don’t know what they’re doing.  Once upon a time, we had something better.’*

Dad folded his arms: *‘Then show me.’*

That Guy’s straightened his paw and stared down Dad.  What was he doing?  It looked like Paper.  As in Rock, Paper, Scissors, but it didn’t quite feel right.  Oh, was it a knife hand?  Big deal.  I knew how to make a knife hand.  Then why were my instincts warning me-?

Suddenly, my wool stood on end.

What just happened?  *Something* happened, but I-I must have blinked.  Wait … what was that silver, fluffy thing Dad’s eye was tracking as it floated to the ground?  It sort of looked like … a piece of his wool?  Yes.  That Guy must have done *something,* but … *I didn’t even see him move!*

Dad raised an eyebrow as the tuft of wool hit the ground.  He looked unimpressed, but I could tell he was just putting on a brave tail.

Dad: *‘So how does it work?’*

That Guy: *‘My sheepdogs know how.  They don’t need all that muscle to take apart an Arxur.  Imagine what they could do* ***with*** *the muscle.’*

Dad: *‘I’m not giving you the code to make more.’*

That Guy: *‘I know, so I'm offering a compromise?  I want your giant in my Sheepdog Program.  He’ll be unstoppable.’*

Dad: *‘And broken.’*

That Guy: *‘If he’s half as tough as you say, he’ll be fine.’*

Dad: *‘If he’s half as tough as I say, you won’t even be able to achieve F.R.I.G.H.T. with him.’*

That Guy: *‘We found a way.’*

Dad: *‘How wonderful to know that you’ve already made plans to* ***break my son.’***

That Guy: *‘Kaebal, we can’t afford to be tribal, or sentimental.  We’re running on borrowed time.  It’s not an if, but a when the Feds find out that Skalga has a Shadow Caste of its own.  They’re getting closer.’*

Dad: *‘There’s no point in winning a war if we lose the things we hold dear in the process.’*

That Guy: *‘There’s no point in holding anything dear if you’re just going to lose-‘*

# “You’ve been staring at that girl an awful lot.”

I almost jumped out of my wool.

The culprit, namely *Mom*, tilted her head innocently.  Since when did she get so close?

I glanced at Rebra, who had stopped mouthing the conversation.  She coolly sipped at a cup of starlight nectar as her ears turned orange.

*“Ohoho,* I’m gonna ship you two *like Titanic* when you get older,” Mom purred almost predatorily.

My ears grew orange.  “Hey, doesn’t Jack die at the end of the movie?”

Her ears lowered as she sighed, stirring her starlight nectar.  The agitation made its white sparks glow brighter.

“Jack gave up too early,” she surmised.  “He could have tried to find a way.  Instead, he just chatted with Rose until he froze to death.  Say, have you ever heard of The Hope Experiment?”

I shook my head.

“See, they put a bunch of mice in a pool of water to see how long they’d swim before they gave up and drowned.  The answer was fifteen minutes.”

*“… Okay,”* I deadpanned.  “That’s kinda dark, even for me.”

“Just before the mice drowned, they pulled them out and gave them a little rest,” she went on.  “Then they put them back in.  How long do you think they swam for?”

“Fifteen minutes?” I supposed.

She pointed the stirring spoon at me.  ***“Forty hours.”***

I blinked.  “What-?  That doesn- *HOW?”*

“They they’d been saved before, so they believed they’d be saved if they just kept swimming,” Mom shrugged.  “They had hope, and the will to persevere.  So, they swam, and they swam, and they swam.”

I stared at the table, pondering the implications.

Mom looked at me with both eyes.  I knew better than anyone that when she did that, I’d best pay attention.

“Brkar, you’re going to be the strongest Venlil in the galaxy,” Mom asserted, “but it’s not because you’re big, or because you eat Best Harvest.  You’re gonna be strong because you *never,* ***ever*** give up.  Anyone can be Strong.  I don’t care how big you grow.  If you can’t be that person, you’ll ultimately fall to someone who is.”

I nodded slowly.  “Right.  \*‘\*A Strong Venlil always finds a way’.”

She sipped her starlight.  “Actually, ‘A ***Clever*** Venlil always finds a way’.  ‘A Strong Venlil always ***makes*** a way’.”

My ears shot up as my eyes flicked back and forth between Rebra and Mom.

**“What in …?** *What in Void’s depths is A Clever Venlil?!?”* I whispered hissily.

*“Shhhh,* don’t bray it!” she whistled.

I tenderly laid the Yotul onto the train’s seat, making it clear that I supposedly *cared* about him.  Even so, we drew the eyes of all the passengers.  Some looked alarmed by the unconscious ‘primitive’, until they caught the whiff of Night Side.

*^(“Yeah.  That’d do it,”)* someone mumbled.

I had to fight back the laugh.

The Human sitting next to me was trying to snap a photo on the sly.  Right. Who *wouldn’t* want a shot of ‘The Venbig’.  As amusing as my popularity was, I wasn’t keen on unsanctioned photos.  I looked straight at him.  Both eyes.  My gaze flicked between him and his pad, letting him know that I knew *exactly* what he was trying to do.

A little sheepish, he put away the pad.

I smiled.

Taken off guard, the Human grinned back.

One third of the passengers almost fell off their chairs.  They looked to be on the verge of a stampede, even if there was nowhere to run.

I exhaled heavily, resting my head back against the window.

“Why are you alive?” I asked, inclining my ears towards the Human.

His smile vanished before he shrugged sourly.  “I dunno, but if it makes jerks like you uncomfortable, I’d say I’ve gotta keep livin’.”

I barked a Terran laugh, turning the passengers’ anxiety to jumpy confusion.

“I like you!” I stated.  “That’s not what I meant.  The world is changing, but slowly.  By the time *no one* has a heart attack every time you sneeze in public, chances are you’ll be dead.  Your kids may get to enjoy a world where they don’t have to live on edge, but you won’t.  So, what keeps you swimming?  Why do you keep going?”

He thought for a very long moment.  “Yeah.  It sucks, but this life is all we’ve got.  One shot, then it’s over.  Besides, there are things that I love.  People that I love.  Who would have thought I’d get to meet aliens.”

I nodded slowly.  “What if you didn’t love anyone, or anything?  Not enough to make it worth it?”

He wrinkled his brow, visibly turning it over in his head.  “Then I’d find someone or something to love.  It’s a big universe.”

“But also, so very small,” I added.

He cracked a more conservative grin, ignoring the passengers who flinched.  “Y’know what?  It’s big enough.”

“Hm,” I grunted.  “So, how do you want to die?”

***“Excuse me?”*** he growled.

“Again, that’s not what I meant,” I sighed.  “Everyone plans to live, no one really thinks about the last thing they want to see, to feel, to do.  I thought, if anyone had an answer, it’d be a Human.”

He cooled down, his eyes darting about as he considered the question.

“I suppose … I’d like to die, doing something I love, with the people I love,” he answered.

I laughed again.  Some of the passengers stared in dull resignation.  They didn’t seem to have any heart attacks left.

“I *knew* there was a reason why I liked your species!” I bellowed, extending my paw for a fist bump.

He laughed with me.  “Right back at ya, speep!”

Marjinl checked his borrowed pad.  “We just got a destination marker for this place called ‘Gojid Coffee’.  Apparently, it’s from Brkar’s pad.”

I wrinkled my brow.  “That’s the opposite side of the city.  In any case, we can’t trust it.  He could be throwing us off.”

“It’s possible,” Marjinl supposed, “although that last message from Lmur sounded off, and it was truncated.  I think Brkar might have confiscated my pad and sent it in a hurried attempt to impersonate Lmur.  My guess is Lmur *somehow* got ahold of Brkar’s pad and sent us that marker.  He’s sneaky like that.”

“Can’t argue there,” I agreed.

We drove in silence for a moment.

“Why don’t we send out a wanted notice?” I asked.  “I mean, we have a rough idea of where the perp is, but we should at least let the public know he’s dangerous, right?”

“If we do *that,* they’ll spook when they see him.  And when they spook, they stampede.  And when they stampede, people die,” Marjinl explained as though he were talking to a child.

“Right,” I huffed.

Marjinl actually let me drive this time, which kept his paws free so he could … honestly, it looked like he was grooming himself.  Fiddling and nibbling at his paws like a praying mantis cleaning its forelegs.  I turned on the radio.  The announcer’s voice bleated through:

*“-nd now, VEnigma, by Starlight Grove’s very own rising stars, Cotton Kansee and Lick Rrish!”*

That typical, Venlil lofi moseyed through the speakers.  I was beginning to feel a tad disappointed, until it eased into breezy indie pop.  Okay.  I kinda liked this.  It reminded me of Cafune’s [Tek It](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxLth9a0cWSo_mSfwQvb0q9EaXgyiN4o5q?si=tfjF0cgdKAqVczjt), but still chill enough to play nice with the other stuff I heard on Venlil radio.

Then the electric guitar riff went feral.

*🎵*  ***“WHO AAAARRE YOUUUUUU?  ( ( LEMME SEE THE REEAAAAL YOUUUU! ) )”***

Ha, that escalated quickly.  Surprisingly, the lyrics were English, though the voices were Venlil, overlapping on the second half.  I could still hear that alien touch, melded with the flames of Terran musical tastes.

***“Yoooooo!***  Alright!  I see you!” I hooted, bouncing to the beat.  “Them speep be goin' goated!”

“Please keep your focus on the road,” Marjinl requested.

“You’re one to talk,” I quipped back.  “Oh, *come on!*  You gotta be feeling this!”

He gave me a weird look.  “Uh … not particularly?”

I shook my head in pity.  “Poor, poor little lamb is missing out.”

Marjinl lowered his ears.  “Didn’t you say these ‘lamb’ creatures were for slaughter?”

***“Shh!***  This vibe is sacred,” I hushed as I turned up the radio.

*🎵  “Who are you?  The real you?  ( ( Wanna see the true you. ) )*

*🎵  Don’t tell me what I wanna hear, when it’s just us two.*

*🎵  Look around, take a chance, we’re at that distance*

*🎵  where no one can see you ain’t trotting to the herd dance.*

*🎵  Who could ever say they overheard*

*🎵  sans the little overhead flowerbirds?*

*🎵 Be free, talk to me, my ( ( friend to the end. ) )*

*🎵 Breaks my heart to see those secrets tearing you apart.*

*🎵  Who are you?  The real you?*

*🎵  ( ( Wanna see the true you. ) )*

*🎵  When we’re alone, and it’s just us two.”*

Marjinls fidgeting kept dragging my eyes back.  Was he nervous?  On a straight stretch of road, I examined him a bit more closely: the way he scraped his claws against each other, filed them on his teeth.

He ran his claws along the booster seat, peeling a trail of rubber before frowning, then returning to nibbling and fussing.

Wait a minute …

*“Marjinl?”* I asked almost cautiously.  “Are you sharpening your claws?”

“Yes,” he answered simply.

“Okay.  *Why* are you sharpening your claws?” I pressed.

His eyes held an edge that I hadn’t seen in a long time.  “Why do you think?”

I took a deep breath and let it out, more frustrated than anything else.  “I thought Lerai got through to you.”

Marjinl stared out the window.  “She did.  I’m just gonna talk to him.”

“With your claws?” I pressed.

“With my claws,” he confirmed.

I side-eyed him.  “What happened to you?”

He whistled bitterly.  *“You* were the one who pulled me out of that space station.  You know what happened.”

“I mean after that,” I almost snapped.  “Look, you went off the grid, then you just show up out of nowhere.  All of a sudden, you’re an officer.  How does that work?”

His razor-sharp gaze unfocused for a moment, before resettling on me.

“How does what work?” he queried.

It sounded genuine.  As usual, either he wouldn’t, or *couldn’t,* give me and answer.

“Never mind,” I shrugged.  “Just … *try* not to do anything you’ll regret, okay?

The moment stretched on.  Didn’t think he’d answer.  I barely caught it.

*^(“… I’ll try …”)*

*“Gnnnnnnnnnngh,”* Lmur half-groaned, half-snored.

Huh … was that what it sounded like when a Yotul woke up?  I could live without that sound.  He was regaining consciousness, but not fast enough for my tastes.  I bapped him on the face a few times to speed up the process.

*“Ow!*  Hey!  I’m up, I’m up!” he yipped grumpily.

“Wonderful.  I’d hate to step into this fine establishment with a drunk in my paws,” I beamed, setting him down.

He tottered on his feet and blinked hazily before sniffing his uniform.  “Did you … did you douse me in Night Side?  Heh, that’s clever.”

“I thought so too,” I quipped.

I took a deep breath of the caffeine-scented air as we stepped into Gojid Coffee, one of the few remaining items on my little bucket list.  Lerai had spoken quite highly of this establishment.  It had upgraded to a whole building of its own at some point over the years.  Must have been pretty good to grow like this.

The Gojid at the counter froze at the sight of me and the ‘wasted’ Yotul, before greeting me with a friendly tail sign.

“What will it be?” he asked.

“The Jumbo Pumpkin Spice Espresso, please,” I requested.

Lmur’s ears perked up.  “Medium Jitterbug, my good man.”

I glared at him.

“Listen.  I am *not* ending this horrible paw without some kind of compensation,” he hissed, dead-serious.  “Indulge me, or I’ll scream bloody murder.”

I rolled my eyes.  “Whatever.  Give him what he wants.”

The Gojid’s gaze flicked uncomfortably between us before he set off to fulfil the order.

I pulled out my pad to transfer the credits, only to notice that it was transmitting a destination marker to Gojid Coffee.  Apparently, it had been doing so for quite a while.

My narrowed eye slid over to the Yotul, who blinked up at me innocently.  His tail twitched like it wanted to wag.

“W-why are you looking at me like *that\~?”* he queried all sing-song-like, playfully waggling his ears.

Leaning on the counter, I perused him with eye anew.  I couldn’t help but quirk a smirk.

“Oh, I’m just curious,” I chuckled. “Does the guild know that they hired a thief?”

His ears froze.

Any indication that he will be releasing something new soon? I imagine he doesn’t announce things and instead just releases them out of the bloom. Or maybe not? Maybe someone here can shed some light on this.

1keg55l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1keg55l/am_i_overthinking_bumble_location/,Am I overthinking Bumble location?,"So I went out on two dates with a guy I matched with on Bumble and our dates went really, really well. We cleared one whole afternoon and evening for each other the first date and a whole evening the second. On the first date, he told me he's going on a two week trip to Canada the following week. We talked about the awkward timing of it, said we'll try to see each other one more time before he leaves and we did that. We agreed to keep in touch during the trip and continue going out and getting to know each other afterwards because we liked each other. Dates really did go well, like, we kissed on the first date and the second, complimenting each other, having deep conversations, been for dinner, been for coffee, been for walks in the park, typical stuff but good. We did have a rather long-ish initial talking stage before actually going out, because of a different trip he was on and a family emergency I had, so we were talking for about three-four weeks on and off before we actually met.

So yesterday he left on his trip to Canada, was leaving for the airport at about noon-1pm. My last message to him on Whatsapp was at about 4pm, wishing him a good flight and telling him to let me know he got there safely at some point. The message got delivered but wasn't seen. It is now 11 a.m the next day (6 a.m in Canada where he should be) and my message still hasn't been seen or responded to. Something was feeling off to me so I opened Bumble where we're still matched, and it has his location listed as Canada where he was going to. 

Now, I normally wouldn't mind that he hasn't responded to me on WhatsApp yet, he would have got to his destination in the evening, probably late, he's staying with family, he might not have had much time to be messaging. But the fact that he's already opened Bumble there just negates all of that to me and just makes it look like he's basically ignoring me. My understanding is that Bumble only updates your location if you actually open the app. 

I don't want to make this into a problem or self-sabotage things somehow but I don't want to be a self-gaslighting idiot either. Is it possible that Bumble updates location even when you haven't opened the app?

They provide us glimpses of how much better we could be and give us reminders of when we fall short.""","STEVE SHIVES: ""Art, especially popular art, is a way of telling ourselves who we are. Sports can be viewed that way, too. [...] Over and above all of that, the fluctuating popularity, the changing with the times, the inspiring and disappointing social and political highs and lows, the emmeritus status they each enjoy as cultural institutions, there's the most important thing baseball and Star Trek have in common: I really, really like them both."" 

https://youtu.be/6M4aWzPIMRM?si=XQ9VUuKslEv7RF1u

""So, given all of these onscreen and off-screen similarities and parallels, why isn't baseball more popular in Star Trek's fictional universe? This sport that lines up so perfectly with the philosophy of these enlightened people in their evolved society, why isn't it the galactic pastime? 

I think the reason is actually pretty simple. The writers of Deep Space
9, some of them at least, were baseball fans. Before Deep Space 9, baseball was rarely, if ever, even mentioned in Star Trek, which means the writers of DS9 not only brought baseball into the franchise. They're also the ones who
established that it was no longer a thing in the 24th century. 

Why would they do that? It might seem paradoxical for writers who are fans of a sport to go out of their way to write references to that sport into their TV show, but then also establish that nobody in their show plays or watches or even knows about that sport. But I bet to my fellow baseball fans out there, it makes perfect sense. 

Baseball fans exist most of the time in one of two states: childlike optimism and weary resignation. As a result, there's a streak of fatalism in us because we know while we're in the optimistic phase that it won't last and eventually that resignation will take over. Baseball fans expect bad things to happen. If
your favorite team is one that typically doesn't do very well, you get used to
bad things happening. That state of resignation settles in and becomes your
status quo. And the childlike optimism is confined to occasional flickers of
hope. 

One of the ways we deal with this to avoid becoming depressed, angry
those of us who do avoid it, is to romanticize our disappointment. We
love it when our team is winning. But when our team is losing and we're still
supporting it, we convince ourselves that we're ennobled by that. We do that
for the entire sport as well. 

Sure, we'd love it if baseball got more popular. If baseball overtook football and was once again legitimately the national pastime here in the United States, but we don't really expect that to happen. We're resigned to the inevitable decline, and we deal with it by making it into an epic tragedy to which we are all sad, powerless witnesses. 

So, writing a sci-fi show set centuries in the future and establishing that
baseball has faded from popular culture. That's exactly what I'd expect a true
baseball fan to do. We're a masochistic bunch. It's not just that, though. We
also get off on thinking of ourselves as the keepers of the flame for liking a
sport that's less popular than it used to be. It allows us to think of
ourselves as better than other people, and that's a good feeling. 

Sorry, I digress. Where I meant to go with that is there's more to the reason why Deep Space 9's baseball fan writers would write baseball as a lost sport by making baseball a relic of the past. **It also makes Sisko's fandom something unique and special. It sets him apart.** It gives him a thing. 

Classic Kirk plays chess and collects antiques. Kelvin Kirk has a fondness for motorcycles. Picard is into archaeology and rides horses. Janeway loves coffee. Archer has a dog and likes water polo. Burnham um has a copy of Alice in Wonderland. Pike likes to cook. All the Star Trek captains have a thing. And baseball is Sisko's thing. The baseball on his desk becomes his symbol. It represents him in his absence. 

When the Starfleet crew is forced to evacuate Deep Space 9 at the end of the show's fifth season and the Cardassians take control of the station, Sisko leaves his baseball behind as a message to Gul Dukat not to get too comfortable in his chair. He does the same thing in the series finale when he goes to be with the prophets in the wormhole. He doesn't say when to expect him, but that baseball on the desk tells Kira and us that Cisco doesn't intend to be away forever. Like baseball in the spring, he'll be back. [...]""

1keg0m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirtazapine_Remeron/comments/1keg0m2/give_me_hope/,Give me hope,"Hi all, I never truly understood what anxiety looked like until I experienced it for myself. I had my first panic attack back in late Jan this year and ever since, I have had crippling anxiety thinking about when I’m next going to have a panic attack. I think I have developed agoraphobia as a result, as I’m scared of getting public transport, getting dinner with friends at restaurants or anything that I can’t easily get out of. All things I never had issues with prior. 

When I had my first panic attack I was at a cafe and an ambulance was called because my symptoms resembled a cardiac episode and the waiter thought I was having a stroke. Basically, it was a very traumatising experience. My ER results were all fine and they sent me home. My GP referred me to a cardiac specialist to rule it out as I was having palpitations that month leading up to the panic attack. In the end my cardiac results were all normal. I have also lost a lot of weight as a result of the anxiety. 

The week following the panic attack, I had to take the week off work as I had debilitating anxiety, where I would wake up with severe nausea causing me to be sick every morning. The thought of getting on the bus to go to work made me severely anxious. This went on for the next 4-6 weeks. I wasn’t living, I was a shell of a human being. I couldn’t even drive my car initially, engage in conversation properly or eat. 

I slowly improved with time and taking Xanax when I was having bad days or before situations that exacerbated the anxiety. I switched to decaf coffee and attempted at doing slow exposure therapy to get back to my ‘normal’. My GP initially prescribed me Prozac, but after the first pill I had a severe reaction that made me sick non-stop and landed me back in the ER. So have been scared to try something similar since.

Just over a week ago now, I decided to try a normal (non-decaf) coffee as I had been doing good. That afternoon I was driving to my parents and started to feel ‘funny’ in the car and when I got there, it had blown into an hour panic attack. My mum thinks it was the caffeine as I had no other ‘triggers’ that day. I was relaxed and didn’t have work. This past week, I went out to dinner with friends and caught a bus and had the panic attack feeling build up, but managed to offset it with deep breathing.

I’m so over feeling like this and fearing my next panic attack, I want to return to the me before this all unfolded. My GP has put me on 7.5mg and it has been a little over a week now. I was definitely super drowsy at first, but noticed my appetite improved right away. I’m still feeling super anxious and scared of having another panic attack come on. So am wondering if I should ask my GP to go up to 15mg.

I checked online reviews, and the biggest complaint at each location is the long wait times. I know I’m not Starbucks and don’t have the same brand loyalty, but they’ve only built on the main streets. However, there are other busy streets in town with high vehicle traffic and freeway entrances/exits that Starbucks hasn’t taken advantage of.

My challenge is that there’s no existing infrastructure, so I’ll need to build a stand from scratch. Has anyone here built a drive-through-only coffee stand?

The work load here is super super light, to the point where it's excessive. But, the expectations are not lined out clearly at all. One person trains me that ""I can do this thing, but I don't HAVE to"" next day I hear complaints that I'm supposed to and didn't. 

I don't HAVE to get anyone up for the day, but it's an unwritten expectation that I do. There's an hour overlap where night shift (me) and day shift are here at the same time, but I can't leave early unless I'm working 16 hours the next day even if the job is done. 

My commute is an hour away. So I've lost my much needed unwinding time and I've got to get up two hours before my shift. Literally had panic attacks because I had to close my eyes and go to sleep and wake up and go back. 

Questions aren't welcome, unspoken but even someone like me can tell. I've always never been afraid to ask dumb or obvious questions because I'd rather be judged for asking than be judged for doing something incorrectly.

Most places have very set black and white expectations and even sheets to work off of. Even my  excessive questions are usually appreciated because it shows I actually give a dam. 


I've even had a panic attack in my sleep, which I didn't know was possible until now. I suppose there isn't really a point or a question to my ramble but I feel like y'all can understand my struggle on a different level.

Please check my other post in this community for context and it explains A LOT. 
My (34F) father committed suicide in September 2024 and since I was a child I have known my Stepmother’s family. My father and Stepmother married in 2018 which I was present for and I have had a great relationship with her side of the family for well over 20+ years. 
My stepmother came to my country to visit my stepbrother in April 2025 and my stepsister came with her. 

I will refer to my stepsister as K and my stepbrother as M, stepmother is SM.

They came and stayed in the same city as me literally 20 mins from my place. I contacted SM a day or 2 after they arrived (they arrived on a Sunday) and invited them to dinner on the Friday. I heard nothing until Wednesday evening saying they weren’t available as they were going somewhere. Fair enough, but they were back on the weekend and I offered to do something on the weekend as I was available no matter the time/location. I heard back that they would come for coffee on Sunday. They were here for an hour…
It wrinkled me as I offered to meet at the location K, M and SM were spending the day as it was 5 mins from my place. My invitation was denied.
They were in my city/country for 2 weeks and apart from the coffee at my place I saw them at dinner for an hour on their last day, which was really lovely but K was super cold to me. I haven’t seen M at all. 
I spoke to one of my remaining blood family members and explained that it feels like I have been blamed for something I had no part in. I feel I have been abandoned again. SM has been avoiding my calls and I have stopped trying to catch up as the rejection is just painful.

Context here: I was severely abused by my biological mother from childhood to my twenties, I am NC with her and half of the family. I have PTSD and a lot of trauma regarding relationships/attachments. 

My relatives and I agree it seems that I am being blamed by association for my father’s actions (honestly read my other post in this community for context). My SM gave me my father’s wedding ring as well. I spoke with my therapist about this (I am in therapy and they are amazing). My therapist advised it seems to be a divorce of the relationship by death so SM may actually start pulling away. 
So it seems that may be the case. I sold the ring btw. It felt tainted. 

Losing my other family because of something I had no part in/knowledge of. Is just another loss I have to grieve over now. I am already grieving a man I thought I knew, grieving the actions and choices he made, plus grieving a family I thought I was part of. 

My therapist wants me to journal but I suck at that so talking to strangers on the internet about my screwed up life is the best I can do. ",1,1746350864.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Im on the 0.5mg pen. 
I've been on for about 3 weeks and I've lost roughly 10lbs already. I am also taking Contrave (Bupriopion + Naltrexone). I was previously on Contrave alone and was not seeing any success.
I was getting headaches, and nausea when trying to eat at a deficit. This would cause me to overeat as my headaches would usually cease when eating my regular amount, defeating the purpose.

Anyway, my doctor added Ozempic and now I'm seeing great success and I find it easy to eat normal portions and am able to stay away from junk food for the most part. I don't even crave it nearly as often as I used to.

Issue is I've been having a lot of difficulty getting Kaiser to cover it. As far as I know, I meet the requirements in CA.

I am a 6 foot male, weighing 340 lbs. That is well above the BMI requirements. Last time I checked I also had pre-hypertension.

Only reason I was able to get it now was because the pharmacist overrode my insurance. Im on my last shot and I fear I won't be able to get any more. Nothing else has worked for me. I tried phentermine in the past and got success but I drink too much coffee and I was having bad nausea because of that.

Anyone have any advise on coverage or any other way that's somewhat affordable I can get GLP-1s?",1,1746350457.0,Ozempic,0,1.0,False

1kefn36,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1kefn36/is_she_into_me_or_not/,Is she into me or not?,"It happened 3 weeks ago during our College week. She's already working and graduated from the same school that I was attending to. I've had a huge crush on her before when I was in my freshmen year and she was already in her 2nd or 3rd year. She's a masc lesbian while I am a fem, and I indeed look straight. I added her on facebook, it was a long time ago but I dont think she knows me and if I exist and before she has a girlfriend, but now she's single ever since last year and I just followed her ig around early of April. 

During College week, which was 3 weeks ago she was there on our school, and there was that day we started to do eye contact. The longest was 5 seconds, the next day, we did eye contact again but I always pull away bcause of my anxiety. It was Tuesday when we have 3 different encounters. 

The first was, I was on a stall, trying out rings to figure out my ring size with my friend until my friend mentions that she's coming and saw her from afar so I look up to confirm and she was, and our eyes met, then I looked away then when she walked, and stopped by the stall where I was and my friend, she just said randomly ""The watch looks cool."" The pointing the watch while her gaze was om me then after she walks away with a friend. 

The second encounter was me and my friend was standing by near the coffee stall where she was sitting by because probably she's friends with the owner. So while standing by, she just go by behind us, my friend noticed it while I was focused during the car show, so my friend mentioned, she keeps pointing or signalling my direction with her friend and I also felt shivers like somoen was staring or looking at my back, not to mention I was wearing a backless top. Then she suddenly just run by my side that caught me off guard, she seems hyper it actually startled me a little. 

The third encounter same day, when I was walking my friend to the gate then just in time I was returning back to the entrance when she come out with her motorcycle and her gaze was on me again, and I caught her again but I pulled away because of my anxiety acting up. 

Then the next day of the college week, I go to school alone then we've encountered again, we did eye contacts, there was this time when we literally just walked by in front of one another and we were quite close when we did the eye contact and it was intense but sadly I break the contact because I hate my anxiety. 

There's also this day when she slide into my dms on ig but just to ask about the winner of the battle of the bands because I was there to that day too and we did eye contact. So i replied then yeah she replies bragging her previous major (radtech) and saud thank you to me then I replied welcome with hahaha then she last chatted me by reacting heart to my message. 

It made me sad, wishing she could add more to the convo. And also I noticed when she's pretty famous here in our school and has lots of followers, and lots of friends in my school too but why did she bothered asking me that when she knew a lot of people that she is closest with that goes to same school as me and ask them instead of me that I am a complete stranger to her. 

The next days of the collegian week we always did eye contact and not to mention even though she's working now, we always crossed paths every week after the college week atleast for once or twice coincidentally and doing eye contact and I know she already recognize me includes my face and name now knowing we've been mutuals now and I've been sending her signals on ig by liking stories, posting songs on my note but never replying to her stories because of anxiety again. 

Not to mention, she's been liking my stories not always but frequently whether it is my face, about school, and even the useless stuffs, she likes my stories. She's the first viewer and liker always when it comes to my stories and same as me to her. I added her to my close friends list and also her adding me too, to her close friend list. 

The last time I saw her we eye contact again but this time I smiled at her then she was already looking at me while I was about to walk pass to her and then she gave me a nod but not a normal nod but rather a slightly swag nod then I look away smiling, failing to keep my composure. 

I was with my friend to who had witnessed it and of course we've laugh.....but seriously I don't know what to do anymore. She's still there everywhere. I haven't seen her this week too so...... I am seriously losing my mind over her.",1,1746350067.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

I was playing quest 3 this morning and everything was fine. I got a controller battery low warning (which I was expecting - it was low), so I saved my game and put the quest to sleep and went to make coffee. When I came back I replaced the controller batteries and wanted to continue playing.

The quest 3 was just not tracking the right controller at all. After replacing the batteries (again) I realized that it was actually just not tracking the controller, but the controller still shows up in the quick settings with a battery charge level and if I push the meta button it still responds to that, just no tracking.

What I tried so far:

1. Maybe it was dud new batteries - replaced them with different batteries - no change.
2. Left the controllers powered off with no batteries in for 10min - no change.
3. Re-paired the controllers in the quest menu. It says ""both controllers connected"" but no change the right controller still didn't track.
4. Used the phone app to unpair both controllers. And pair both controllers again - no change.
5. Cleaned the tracking camera lenses - no change.
6. Completely powered off the quest 3 by long holding the power button and then turn it on again - no change.

I also have a quest 3S, so I paired the 3S controllers to my quest 3 and tracking worked for both controllers.

I paired the quest 3 controllers to my quest 3S and I had the same issue where the right controller doesn't track but I can see the controller battery status and it responds to the meta button, just no tracking on the right controller.

After all this testing, I think that the only logical conclusion is that my right controller tracking LED has failed and needs to be replaced.

p.s. When pairing the 3 controllers to the 3S it did force a controller firmware update (on both controllers) but there was still no tracking on the right controller after the controller firmware update.",1,1746349673.0,OculusQuest,0,1.0,False
1kefj01,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheGringoJournal/comments/1kefj01/no_signal_no_spanish_no_problem_sort_of/,"No Signal, No Spanish, No Problem (Sort Of)”","Before I left the U.S., I wasn’t winging it — I was doing my homework. I went to the Cricket Wireless store *twice* to make sure my phone would work in Colombia. Both times, they gave me the same confident answer: “You’ll be fine.” I even asked specifically about Medellín. They nodded like it was no big deal. I walked out thinking I had one less thing to worry about.

That illusion shattered the moment my plane touched down. I turned off airplane mode, expecting to see that comforting little bar of service appear — but nothing. No calls. No texts. Just the spinning wheel of “searching…” I was still calm at first. “It’ll come on in a minute,” I told myself. It didn’t. So I hopped on the airport Wi-Fi and called Cricket. That’s when they hit me with the truth: “Cricket Wireless is not available in Colombia.” Just like that, I was disconnected in every sense of the word. If you take anything from this entry, **double-check with your phone provider and ask specifically about international service in the country you’re going to. Don't assume they know.**

Fortunately, I had a backup plan — sort of. A friend back home had connected me with a local driver in Medellín. He had known the guy for years and vouched for him completely. Solid. But without cell service, I had to use the airport Wi-Fi again to reach him through WhatsApp. That’s when the next realization hit me: he didn’t speak a word of English. Not a phrase. Meanwhile, my Spanish at that point was basically a polite nod and “gracias.” To top it off, I couldn’t use Google Translate — no signal. We made it work, somehow. He showed up, smiled, grabbed my bags, and drove me through the chaotic beauty of Medellín. Thankfully, he already knew where I was staying, or else that would’ve been a different kind of story.

We pulled up to the hotel, and I exhaled for what felt like the first time in hours. I wasn’t home, but I was safe — for now. The first thing I did was unpack my laptop and try to connect to my company’s server to check in. The plan was to continue working remotely. I was counting on that income to make this move sustainable. But of course, nothing is ever that simple. I couldn’t log in. Couldn’t access the system. It was a tech issue I couldn’t fix without help, and it was Saturday. I suddenly realized I had at least two full days ahead of me without any real idea if this move was going to work. I had no phone, no job access, and very little Spanish. I was in Medellín physically, but mentally I was floating in limbo.

By Sunday morning, I needed a reset — something small and comforting. I decided to go out for coffee. I walked down La 70, a vibrant street known for its energy, food, and music. I stumbled upon a tiny café with just the right atmosphere — humble, warm, and authentic. Sitting there with a cup of Colombian coffee in my hand, watching the city move around me, it felt like I was starting to sync with the rhythm of the place. It was one of those quiet wins that meant more than it should. But on the way back to the hotel, I made a wrong turn. Still no cell service, and now I was navigating with only memory and luck. After some tense moments retracing my steps, I eventually made it back. Close call, but I shook it off.

Later that day, I decided to explore a bit more. I still didn’t have phone service — I was holding off switching plans until I confirmed I could work remotely. I left the hotel, but took another wrong turn, completely unaware. I kept walking for 15–20 minutes, expecting to recognize something — but nothing looked familiar. Before long, I found myself near the Estadio area. I'd heard of it, but never been there, and at that moment it might as well have been another city. I tried asking a few locals for help, but the language barrier made things awkward and unproductive. People were friendly, but we just couldn’t connect the dots.

Then came a moment when things got a little sketchy. It was around **6 PM**, still light out, but the sun was starting to fade. I was walking behind three young guys — probably late teens, early twenties. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Just people walking the same direction. But then one of them casually tagged a sign as we passed, and something in me clicked. I wasn’t scared — but I was alert. I slowed down, crossed the street, and reminded myself: *you’re a long way from home, and it’s better to be cautious than confident.*

That’s when I saw a 24-hour bakery and headed inside. It felt safe — well-lit, with people coming and going. I asked if I could use their Wi-Fi. At first, the staff gave me a few hesitant looks. I get it — a random lost foreigner showing up asking for internet isn’t exactly normal. But one of the guys working there stepped in to help. He connected me. I pulled up Google Maps — finally. Turns out, I was just a **12-minute walk** from my hotel.

Now sure, 12 minutes isn’t far — and it wasn’t even dark yet — but I stood out like a neon sign that screamed *lost gringo.* I didn’t want to take chances wandering through unfamiliar streets looking confused. I messaged my driver, who wasn’t even working that day, and like a true MVP, he came to pick me up without hesitation.

He got me back to the hotel safely — no drama, just relief.

**Lesson learned:**  
If you're moving to a new country — especially if it’s your first time — **make sure your phone works.** Don't leave it to chance. Communication is survival when you're navigating a new world.

This week was messy, eye-opening, and a little nerve-wracking. But it was mine. I earned it. And despite the bumps, I wouldn’t trade it. I’m not here for perfection — I’m here for growth.

1kefi38,https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1kefi38/personal_logdoc/,Personal_Log.Doc,"**December 13, 2019**

Normally, I’m not the type to keep personal logs, but I believe it'll be beneficial in the long run.  

For transparency, I will admit that I suffered from a heroin addiction that began in my early twenties, and during that time, my recollection was affected. As of writing this, I’ve successfully been off of Suboxone for six months. I haven't touched any other substances besides coffee. I don’t exactly have a mind like a steel trap – not like I used to – but for the most part, my mental stability and memory are fairly reliable. 

The reason I bring my past up is to demonstrate that this account comes from someone who is not under the influence of any psychoactive substances or currently suffering from any psychological or neurological disorders. 

The main purpose that this log shall serve is as a back-up, in case I forget something that I should remember. It's also possible that my memories could be changed in the future; some of the Neighbors are capable of doing that. Or in case I die or am otherwise unable to complete my duties as the owner and manager of Orion Pest Control LLC. 

I'll begin with the first potential relic that I've encountered. I say ‘potential’ because I had only one interaction with him that was cause for concern. Every encounter since then has been cordial. 

Going forward, a ‘relic’ can loosely be defined as a Neighbor of the Hills capable of causing massive destruction to people and property. These ancient Neighbors go beyond the scope of a specialty pest control company and are best to be avoided, when possible. Something else that should be noted is that, unlike lesser Neighbors such as Housekeepers and Dreamers, many of these beings of power are capable of assimilating into human society by appearing like one of us. It is because of this quality that identifying them can be difficult. 

Back when I worked with the River Kingz, we only ever had relics passing through. To my knowledge, we never had any take up permanent residence; if there were, they kept to themselves. Neighbors aren't inherently antagonistic towards humans, after all. Relics are no different. 

This has become too long-winded for my liking, so I will shorten it by saying that I suspect that our town's only mechanic is one such Neighbor. 

My first indication that something was peculiar about him was that during our initial meeting, he gave me a fake name: Jonathan Darner. Considering that this could change at any time, he will henceforth remain known simply as ‘the mechanic.’ 

Reading this back, I sound like some sort of paranoid nutjob. Maybe I am. But in this line of work, paranoia is an asset of survival.

He casually asked me if I had a name during our introduction. I examined his face, eyes, the way he carried himself. No trace of malice or hunger. Just a charming smile as he leaned onto the counter, forearms pressing into the surface, hands clasped loosely. 

It doesn’t make sense for a Neighbor to be a mechanic. Lot of iron. That’s like someone with a nut allergy working in a peanut butter factory. Of course, he was wearing gloves and had protective glasses hanging from the collar of his shirt. Standard PPE for his profession, which conveniently doubles as a way for one of *them* to keep from coming into contact with an allergen. 

I didn’t tell him my name. I just pretended like he’d never asked, going forward with what I’d been intending to discuss with him, “I saw you have a truck for sale.”

His expression didn’t change, keeping that smile. If he was angry that I didn’t identify myself, he didn’t show it as he replied, “Well, it ain’t mine, I’m just lettin’ the guy use my lot. That, and I just fixed it up for ‘em, so I still got the keys if ya wanna take a look at it.”

Judging by his accent, the mechanic is from somewhere down south. I don’t know if that has any significance, when it comes to identifying him. 

He then asked, “Now, just outta curiosity, you plannin’ on usin’ it for personal transport or for work?”

“I’m actually starting up a business down the road from you.” I answered. “It used be a tax place, I think.”

His chuckled, “Yeah, I know the one. Forgive me if I’m bein’ a bit presumptuous, but you don’t strike me as the ‘desk jockey’ type. So, why don’t ya tell me a bit about what you're plannin’ on doin’ with it?”

What was strange was that I had the impulse to open up to him. When I looked into the mechanic’s eyes, I wanted to trust him. That’s not like me. Not like me at all. 

But without hesitation, I did, that impulse turning into an insurmountable urge the longer he maintained eye contact with me. 

I told him about what my goals were with starting Orion. About my methods of dealing with atypical pests. Everything he wanted to know about my company, I told him. The entire time, I was lost in his eyes. 

It was hard to tear my gaze away from his. Thankfully, once he got what he wanted, he let me, giving me a mysterious smile afterwards. 

“Sounds like ya got good intentions,” He commented. 

“I’m not here to make trouble,” I informed him, staying calm and professional despite the unease I felt after he'd effortlessly took over my will. 

When he didn't say anything, that made me even more anxious, prompting me to add, “And when it comes to certain situations, I know better than to get involved. I know my place in this world.”

My advice for anyone that may read this log is as follows: when confronted by beings of power, especially potential relics, it's best to appeal to their sense of superiority. Remind them that you aren't worth their time. Maybe, if they're feeling generous, they'll let you walk away unscathed. Relatively speaking, of course. 

He seemed to consider what I said. After some deliberation, he merely shrugged and said, “Alrighty.” 

That had been a test. Considering that I’m still alive and my mind is still intact, I’m inclined to believe that I’d passed it. 

Something else that should be mentioned as that there was another specialty pest control company here before us. *Was.* They'd all had to be cremated. Apparently, there wasn't much left to burn. No one is sure what Neighbor is responsible. All I know is that I don't intend to follow in their footsteps. 

The mechanic then went on to tell me about the truck as he plucked a key hanging on a gathering of small hooks behind the counter. Its previous owner had hit a deer, so it's a salvage title. He’d completely restored the engine and ‘all that jazz,’ to quote him. 

“I can see your eyes glazin’ over, so I’ll spare ya any more details,” he said with a playful grin and a wink. “But I have the complete report in my paperwork. I’ll give ya a copy before you leave.”

The truck was in good shape. At least, from what I could tell; I’m not exactly an expert. No weird noises when it started up. No obvious signs of disrepair, at least to my untrained eye. 

If the mechanic had been the seller, I wouldn’t have even entertained the idea of buying it. The risk of having him learn my name from a title or license wasn’t one I was willing to take. 

On that note, as I inspected the inside of the cab, I attempted to sound casual as I asked, “You really the only shop in this area?”

Leaning against the truck’s bed, he replied with a smirk, “Sure am! Next one is an hour out, and them fuckers’ll rob ya blind.”

Shit. I was afraid of that, but I'd expected it. A few of the locals had said the same. This mechanic’s shop was recommended to me for that reason. I resisted the urge to sigh. 

Crossing his arms, he then continued. “Speakin’ of, I figure I should let ya know that I give discounts to the small businesses ‘round the area for my services. Way I see it, we all gotta stick together. Look out for each other. Ya gettin’ me?”

As I exited the truck, I passively responded, “I'll keep that in mind.”

If my time with Sam and Eliza has taught me anything, it’s that being direct with the Neighbors of the Hills isn’t recommended in most cases. However, I couldn’t think of any way to be vague about this pertinent question. “I wouldn’t have to tell you my name, would I?

With a short laugh, he confirmed, “It’s Pennsylvania Law, son. Ya gotta give me a name.”

*Wouldn't be the first time I've used forged documents.*

*Note to any law enforcement who may find this log: if you arrest me, you get the pleasure of dealing with this shit yourself. Keep that in mind. 

After that first encounter, I was apprehensive to take him up on his offer to ‘support small businesses.’ Under ideal circumstances, it would be safest to deal with someone else, even if they charged through the nose. However, these were *not* ideal circumstances. Even with the River Kingz helping me out, after moving here and all of the other expenses I've had to take care of in the beginning of Orion's inception, my bank account was looking a little abysmal. Not to the point where I was in danger of living in my car, but enough that his offer and the risks associated with it seemed necessary. 

However, I did weigh my options carefully. While I didn’t appreciate him getting into my head, it was clear that he wasn’t hostile, at least not at the time. He had the opportunity to do far worse to me, but didn't. It seemed more like he was testing the waters with me. 

I also know that the Neighbors have rules they need to follow, even the relics. Whatever that mechanic is, he may not have been able to do much more than mess with me a bit. 

So, despite my suspicions about him… money is money. And if this is going to work, I'm going to need all of that I can get. 

In the meantime, I'll be keeping an eye on him. Depending on what he is, I doubt that I could do much against him if he ever became hostile, but I'd rather know it's coming, if it ever does. 



**January 2nd, 2020**

Ever since I took my first atypical call, I've been noticing crows. Just one or two. 

At first, I wondered if it was a False Tree. They've been known to utilize birds to keep watch over their territory. However, the avians that the False Trees employ are just regular birds. Besides their allegiance, there are otherwise no abnormalities about them. 

However, when it comes to these crows, their shadows aren't tethered to their owners. Their calls have a strange quality to them as well, though I've taken care not to listen to them too closely. As ominous as their presence is, the crows haven't tried to attack or otherwise interfere with my duties. They've simply watched. 

We never dealt with anything like that back in Ohio, so this was something completely new to me. When I left, the Kingz gave me copies of most of their records so, thankfully, I had somewhere to start when it came to trying to figure out what they are. 

Before I give my potential diagnosis, I want it to be known that saying the name of these Neighbors draws them to you. Never say it out loud, *especially* after sundown. With that warning out of the way, I suspect that they're *sluagh sidhe.* 

I'm not sure if writing it has the same damning effect as saying it. However, if that were the case, I'd imagine that there would be no one left alive to report on these Neighbors. 

When it comes to their behavior, they're Neighbors known to fly primarily at night, searching for souls to steal. What becomes of those individuals isn't noted in these records, but I imagine that it isn't pleasant. They appear to be rather particular about who they take; whether that’s because of specific conditions they must abide by or mere taste preferences, I'm not sure. One source claims that they're drawn towards ‘sinners,’ though, that term is a bit too vague for my liking. I'm seeking to clarify this by scouring for more information. Once I find clarification, I'll denote it and update Orion's records accordingly. 

However, the birds themselves aren't my primary concern. Their appearance is said to precede something far worse. 

The mechanic is the most obvious suspect. He did make a point to get into my head the first time we met. Every time I pass his shop, I keep an eye out for crows, but I haven't seen any lingering around. It's entirely possible that he could be something else and the timing is purely coincidental. But nothing is ever just a coincidence in this line of work. 

That being said, my plan is merely to keep my head down. If he is what I think he is, that’s the only thing I *can* do. If I'm lucky, the crows’ commander will lose interest. Move on to someone else. 




**January 12th 2020**

I had to see the mechanic for the first time to get the truck serviced. One of the tire sensors was going off even though they all had air. Nothing major. Just annoying. 

When I arrived at his shop, I made a point to look for any signs of the black birds. No nests. No distant caws either. Not even a feather on the ground. If they do serve the mechanic, he's careful not to leave any trace behind. 

It took him a minute to greet me, despite there being an old bell over the door to alert him to my entry. As I waited, I heard metallic clanks coming from the back. I wondered if maybe he didn't hear the bell over his racket. 

Subtly, I glanced around, trying to see if there was anything out of place, but taking care not to touch anything. Truthfully, I wasn't entirely sure what I should've been looking out for. A business card for soul removal services? 

I stopped my snooping when there was a pause in the noise. Brows furrowed, I saw him lean partially into the doorway, then he hurriedly set his tools onto the nearest surface before striding in to greet me., “Didn't hear you come in! You weren't waitin' long, were ya?”

“No,” I replied, fishing out my falsified driver's license as an excuse to avoid looking at him. “I'm taking you up on your offer. One of the tire sensors is doing… something. I don't know what, but it's obnoxious.”

He snorted. “Yeah, I can take a look at it. Just need some contact information first.”

*Moment of truth.*

When I presented my fake ID to the mechanic, I kept my gaze off to the side, gauging his reaction from the corner of my eye. I thought I saw him smirk a bit, but he didn't question me. 

“Good enough!” He eventually said, his tone oddly playful as if we were sharing a private joke. “Give me a few hours. I got a piece of shit Fiesta that I'm tryin’ to raise from the dead.”

To this day, he still hasn't questioned me on the accuracy of my documentation. He'd only said he needed a name. He never specified it had to be a real one, after all. 

From that point on, that has been the foundation of our working relationship: we accept each other's fake names and otherwise stay out of each other's way. But ever since that initial interaction, I make sure to always avoid his gaze. 

While he continues to be friendly, I still don't trust him. When it comes time for me to hire other employees, I will ensure that this distrust is emphasized and that care is taken around the mechanic. However, thanks to the pandemic, that'll be some time. 

Every once in a while, I'll see one of those strange crows, but their appearances are getting fewer and further between, much to my relief. Whoever is commanding them must be losing interest. My guess is that they wanted to make sure that I'm not here solely to harass the Neighbors unprovoked. It's unfortunate and disgraceful, but it does happen. So called ‘monster hunters.’ 

It wouldn't surprise me if that's how the company preceding Orion met their demise. If they made a mistake and were punished for it. There are no second chances when it comes to the *sluagh.*

Mistakes and misdeeds will not go unnoticed. Because of that, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing. The crows and the thing commanding them don't seem to have a problem with that. 





**April 5th, 2024**

For this log entry, I'm putting a password on the document. For Nessa and Reyna's sake, it's better that they know as little about what's happened to me as possible. 

To put it bluntly, I died. There's no sugar-coating it. 

It's funny. Many times, I've joked that the only time I'd open up to someone is during my autopsy. Now, here I am. Wishing more than anything that someone knew what happened to me, but knowing that admitting it would cause more harm than good. 

Perhaps it would help to detail what happened here. 

Last night, I received a phone call from an old acquaintance. We knew each other back when I was using. I shouldn't have answered. Unfortunately, I have a conscience, and that conscience reminded me of all the times I'd ended up in awful situations while under the influence. There were numerous times Sam and Eliza could've chosen not to answer the phone, but still did. I'd probably still have a needle in my arm, if it weren't for them. 

There is a distance between the man I want to be and the man that I am. All I wanted was to close it. To be a bit more like the people I've looked up to for so long. 

There's a part of me that wonders why this happened. Maybe this is a punishment for all the terrible choices I've made. According to my research, that appears to be the case. Not just anyone can become a draugr. I went wrong somewhere. Horribly wrong. 

I've never seen a written account from someone who has undergone this sort of transformation before. For educational purposes and for my own benefit, I will detail how it happened as best as I can. Then once I have determined that it is safe to do so, I intend to share this personal testimony. 

The words aren't coming easily. I keep wondering what I did wrong. 

Nick had said he'd needed a place to crash. Just for the night. As much as I didn't enjoy the idea of having company – especially the kind that sleeps in my apartment – I would've felt like an ass for turning him away. For one night, I'd have to hold on to my years of sobriety and act as a drug sitter. I thought I was doing the right thing. 

When he showed up, he was in that terrible stage of withdrawal where his hands were wracked with shakes. He was sweating buckets despite the chill of the day. He smelled, too, reeking as if it had been days since he'd showered or used even a singular swipe of deodorant. At least he wasn't so far into it that he'd become incontinent. 

The dumbass actually *drove* in that condition. That should've been my first indicator that I was making a terrible mistake. Clearly, he had no regard for others’ lives, let alone his own. Back when we'd run in the same circle, he hadn't seemed that flippant. Either he'd changed or I didn't know him quite as well as I thought I did. After the way last night went, I'm inclined to believe it was the latter. 

From the moment Nick arrived, he was in a state. At the time, I'd chalked it up to irritability – another delightful side effect of withdrawals – and tried talking him down. He didn't believe me when I told him that I was clean. 

“As far as my pops knows, I'm clean,” he snapped, wiping sweat from his hairless, red forehead. “I mean, *look* at you!”

I do recall thinking, *‘Well, fuck you, too.’*

“I’m not strung out, I'm just old and tired,” I argued flatly. “Seriously, I don't have anything. But I do have the phone number for the clinic I went to-”

Nick began to laugh. It sounded weird. Shrill. It made me uneasy. 

“Those places are fuckin’ cults!” He began to rant, pacing around my kitchen. “They tell you you're broken and you need God and shit! Swapping one addiction for another is what it is! It's fuckin’ brainwashing! If someone ever sent me to a place like that I… I'd…”

He'd trailed off. In that moment of quiet, I warned him, “Nick, you need to try to calm down.”  

“*You* calm down!” he shouted, apparently unconcerned about waking the people trying to sleep next door. “You calm down and just… just… stop lyin’ to me, man!”

The gun I use for work was hidden in my bedroom, out of sight from my now-unwelcome visitor. I didn't want to have to use it on him, but his behavior was making my heart race. Everything within me told me that I'd made the wrong decision by letting him into my home. 

“Nick, I'm serious,” I told him. 

*BANG!* His fist hit my counter. I tensed, using every ounce of self control that I had to keep from making any sudden movements. 

“*I'm not fucking around here!*” he bellowed.  

He'd gone past irritability and right to hostility. 

Everything happened quickly after that. Metal clattered as he rummaged through silverware. I made a break for the bedroom. Footsteps behind me. Heat in my back that was so sudden and penetrating that my lungs stopped working. Deep within my skin. Past muscles. The knife grated clumsily against my rib bone as it slid out. 

Distantly, as if I were underwater, I heard him yell again, but couldn't understand it. I think I was crawling. To where, I don't know. I fell, pushing myself onto my back to face Nick. 

When I tried to push him back, that burn only intensified to the point of making my vision go dark. While I was stuck in that void, I suddenly needed to cough. I tried. Liquid. Tasted like metal. I coughed again. I couldn't get it out. When I tried to breathe, more hot metal poured down my throat. No matter how much I choked on it, either trying to get it down or up, I couldn't clear my airway. 

Dimly, I remember thinking, *that's it.* 

*Thump-thump.*

It was cold. I wasn't in my bed. Where was I? 

*Thump-thump.*

When I tried to sit up, my forehead bumped into metal. As I began to regain my senses, I could feel the bumps of a road beneath my back. A trunk. I was in the trunk of someone's car.

*Thump-thump.*

The first thing I want to note is that it's the absences that affect me the most, the worst of them being the one I'd noticed from the moment I woke up. Empty. My chest was empty. My blood sits, as cold and still as a frozen lake without my heart to circulate it. At first, I'd thought I'd been hollowed out, and my guts replaced with snow. 

*Thump-thump.*

Someone's heart was pounding. Not mine. So whose?

*Thump-thump.*

The hollow chill inside of me was interrupted by a hunger so intense that it made my teeth clench, my stomach cramping from it. I knew deep within the depths of my soul I needed to find that pulse. 

*Thump-thump.*

Gingerly, I felt around me in the darkness of the trunk until my fingertips brushed against the fuzzy, coarse material that lined behind the back seats. I pushed. They budged. 

*Thump-thump.*

My stomach rumbled. My mouth watered. That heart beat was taunting me. Gritting my teeth together, I shoved at the seat. 

*Thump-thump thu-thump thu-thump.*

I pulled myself through the back seat towards the pulse as it called to me like the frantic pounding of a drum. Tires screeched. I flew into the back of the driver's seat as the car came to a sudden, skidding stop. 

*Thu-thump-thu-thump-thu-thump.*

The door opened. Nick ran from me, his frantic shouts drowned out as my focus remained locked only on his pulse. Whatever he said, it didn't matter. The only thing that I cared about was finding what was inside of him. 

I acknowledge how this sounds. These are the ramblings of a ravenous monster. But at the end of the day, all that man was good for was meat. And even then, he could've used some paprika. Nobody can change my mind on that. 

I followed him into a corn field. He was calling for help. First his shouts echoed through the field, then they became quieter.  

*Thu-thump-thu-thump-thu-thump.*

His voice cut through the corn again and through the haze of red that had taken over my awareness. It had been reduced to a sob. “Dad! I messed up real bad!” 

*Thu-thump-thu-thump-thu-thump.*

Something I want to make transparent is that prior to my transformation, I wasn't a violent person. I wouldn't go so far as to call myself a pacifist by any stretch of the imagination, but I always preferred to resolve my problems with more practical solutions. Following that, I also have never had any cannibalistic urges prior to this incident. So when I say I reacted on instinct when I reached Nick, I want it to be known that this instinct hadn't been present until after I woke up in Nick's trunk. 

All that I knew when I reached him was that he was the only thing that could make the coldness in my limbs subside. 

*Thu-thump-thu-thump-thu-thump.*

I threw him to the ground and began to dig. Tearing his clothes, exposing the unwashed skin, then removing that next. The easiest way was to bite through it; his flesh had a pungent, sour flavor. I imagine it wouldn't have been so terrible if he'd had the mind to shower beforehand. 

Gradually, the taste improved as I tore through the stringy layers of tissue, soon giving way to muscle. The texture was chewy. Ropey. I spat it out, the consistency making my stomach lurch. 

*Thu-thump-thu-thump-thu-thump.*

Nick was still alive. He'd gone from pleading to whimpering. 

The thin layer of muscle was slippery in my hands as I raked them out of the way, searching for the source of his pulse. I was becoming desperate for some sort of relief from the cold as I snapped his ribs, tugging at his lungs to get to what all of this excess was protecting. 

*Thu-thump-thu-thump. Thump. Thump.*

Nick had stopped moving. 

His heart was hot in my hand. Its movements were lurching and erratic until I tore it out. As grotesque as this comparison is, removing it required the same miniscule amount of effort as plucking an apple from a tree. 

Unlike the skeletal muscle I'd had to sort through in order to get to it, the heart had a dense, yet lean texture. Still chewy, but much more tolerable. No tendons to get through. It went down easy. Pleasantly. 

The effect was immediate from the first bite. The emptiness began to alleviate, my fingertips tingling as the warmth of the heart chased away the chill within my veins. However, consuming it didn't fully eliminate either the emptiness or the cold. It merely made it so that I was capable of rational thought again. 

No longer driven by hunger and pain, the reality of the situation finally sank in. What he'd done. What I'd done. And I was left, kneeling in the dirt, hands and mouth covered in the evidence of it as the corn loomed above us like an accusing jury. 

Nick's eyes appeared to have been replaced with glass. His mouth hung open. After he died, his bowels released, making him even more pungent than he was before. It was then that I had the awareness to notice that he'd been on the phone. Whoever he'd called hadn't answered. 

At the time, I'd thought he was astonishingly light, but according to my records, one of the symptoms of my condition is unnatural strength. While I carried him out of the field, my mind whirled as I worked out what needed to be done. 

When I woke up, he'd been in the midst of trying to make me and the terrible thing he’d done disappear. Now, I had to do the same to him. The first thing that had to be disposed of was the body. Next was his car. I won't disclose the location of either. This is partially for reasons of self-preservation, and partially because that information is ultimately unimportant. I'm not proud of what happened that night, but I don't regret it either. 

What matters is the changes I've experienced since yesterday night. The hunger is the most concerning. 

After disposing of my murderer and everything that could trace him back to me, I returned to my apartment. I'd cleaned myself up as best as I could by making a stop at the river. However, there was nothing I could do to hide the gash he’d carved into my throat. As I passed each apartment, I could hear each and every heartbeat in a maddening symphony. That ache returned to my gut, the chill in my limbs becoming more urgent. I dug my nails into the palms of my hands, the pain helping me to ignore every single one of them. 

I regret to say that if any of my neighbors had exited their apartments while I passed by, I might not have been able to stop myself. 

Once inside, the pragmatism that had been piloting me that entire night finally ran out. I collapsed onto my couch. Numb. Mentally and physically, I was numb. But beneath that layer of what could easily be misconstrued with apathy was a scream. A visceral, animal cry of despair that I didn't dare let out.

For hours, I sat there. Head swimming. Alternating between a dense fog and abject terror. And through the haze, my neighbors’ pulses beckoned to me. 

I took in a shuddering breath. My first one since I opened my eyes in that trunk. It is a choice rather than a necessity. And habit. I've grown used to sighing at every inconvenience, minor or otherwise. The air whistled through the wide grin carved into my neck. An unpleasant, irritating tickle breezed against the sensitive, torn flesh. 

Dreading what I was about to see, I rose, barely feeling the floor beneath my feet as I warily made my way towards the bathroom. 

Some more changes that have occurred have to do with my appearance. I'd been pale to begin with, but after my murder, my skin had turned a deathly shade of gray. The dark circles under my eyes were even more pronounced, looking more like bruises. My lips have lost all color. There is a dull, glassy sheen to my eyes. More like seeing a mannequin or a wax figurine of myself. Uncanny. 

The gash across my throat continued to leak air each time I habitually took a panicked breath in or out. Thanks to my laziness when it comes to shaving, it's not that noticeable as long as I keep my chin tilted down. But if I look up too far, the puffy, pink, fleshy layer beneath the top few layers of skin is visible. 

I located some superglue in the back of one of my drawers. So far, it's doing a decent job of keeping the skin flaps in place. I've also been covering it with a bandana. Not the most fashionable choice, but at least now, there's no chance of anyone seeing it. 

Before I knew it, the sun rose. Outside my window, a crow called. Its shadow was flying without it. 

Quickly, I closed the blinds, unconsciously backing away from the window. 

As I've mentioned in a previous entry, the *sluagh* hunt the souls of the dead, namely those that are weighed down with guilt and grief. 

As previously stated, not just anyone can become a draugr. According to what I've read, the circumstances of such a transformation have to align perfectly, the first being that the individual must suffer a violent death. Clearly, that happened in my case. The other condition that must be met is that the individual in question has to be dishonorable in some regard to be denied entry into the afterlife. It could be that the individual was, at best, not very well-liked in their community, or at worst, outright evil. I would say that I more closely resemble the former. While I was committing slow suicide via heroin, I burned a lot of bridges. My own father had to cut me out for his own sanity. Before then, we'd been close.  

I don't blame him. I really don't. I just wish more than anything in this world that I could've told him that I'm sorry. 

In that same token, the crows are drawn towards those they deem wicked or weak in some regard. To further explain the latter, they have been known to harass grief-stricken individuals or those suffering from a broken heart. I would imagine that a draugr grieving over himself is the ideal prey for the black birds and the one that commands them. 

As such, under no circumstances can the crows’ master know that I'm dead.

While I don't have a concrete plan, I believe that the best thing I could do for myself and my organization is to do my damndest to keep going like nothing has happened. Manage the hunger. Hide the obvious signs of my condition. Business as usual. 

The crow's beady eyes didn't stray from me for even a second as I left to do exactly that. 






**April 7th, 2024**

My colleagues keep asking questions. They're not stupid. They can tell that something has happened. Hell, anyone with eyes can, considering that I look even more like shit than usual. 

One other measure I've had to take to mask my condition is scent control. I've become paranoid that the smell of decay has begun to follow me. Because of that, I've resorted to reopening the wound, stuffing it with potpourri, then gluing it shut again. It's a stupid and painful process, but it's been working. 

Unfortunately, Nessa and Reyna aren't the only ones with keen eyes. Those fucking crows have been tailing me. I wouldn't be surprised if the birds were keeping watch on them as well. 

Nessa also mentioned to me that the mechanic had asked about me, admitting that he'd looked into her eyes. That confirms that I'd made the right decision by not telling her. Not because I don't trust her, but because if my suspicions about him are true, the last thing I want is to drag her into this. 

What makes matters worse is that something came to my apartment yesterday. 

My ordinary protections against atypical intruders have had to be altered thanks to the changes I've experienced. While I have no trouble touching a container that salt is housed in, direct contact causes what can best be compared to chemical burns. Even so, with those birds haunting me, I've been risking it. 

The line wasn't perfect. It wasn't flush with the door, leaving a decent sized gap present. It also curled a bit at the end, thanks to some of the salt landing on the back of my hand. 

While the skin peeled and reddened, I ran it under water. That was when I heard a new heartbeat. One that stood out from the rest. 

It was rapid, as if its owner was excited. And it was right outside my door. All I could do was watch and hope that the salt line held as shadows appeared beneath the gap in my front door. 

At first, I thought they were snakes. No. *Thorns.* Black, tipped with red. They slithered in, rising slowly. Without making a single sound, they slid along the wood of my door, approaching my deadbolt. 

Thorns like these are completely new to me. I couldn't find any information about them after the fact. 

Not wanting to find out what would happen if that door opened, I seized the container to toss salt at the invading vines. Instantly, they withdrew, twitching like worms that had been caught in the sun. 

Jaw clenched, poised to throw more, I listened. That strange heartbeat outside my door didn't alter. Looking back, I'm curious if my ominous visitor's pulse was truly due to some sort of excitation, or if it was because its resting heart rate was naturally quicker than a human's. 

Unexpectedly, my doorbell rang. My visitor probably thought it was being funny. 

Afterwards, a deep voice mockingly called from the other side, “Have you accepted Jesus as your personal savior?”

I didn't recognize the speaker. Not the mechanic, after all. Another potential relic?

All that I was certain of was that I had to be cautious. Whoever he was, he'd already tried to break in, and he would have succeeded if I hadn't been close by to stop him. It's a good thing there was a door separating us. The look I leveled at the wood could've melted steel beams. 

“What do you want?” I asked, keeping the impatience from my tone. 

The visitor replied, “I think you know why I’m here.”

So I was speaking with the crows' master. My fears had been confirmed. They either knew or at least strongly suspected that I had died. 

“I'm afraid that it's not going to be possible for us to meet,” I told him evenly. “Running my own business takes up a majority of my time, and with how things have been picking up lately, we don't have the staffing for me to be able to take a day off. I hope you understand.”

The visitor clicked his tongue before saying, “Oh, I understand completely. I'm in a similar boat myself. My superior has a bit more flexibility than I do, so I'll be sure to pass that along.”

That was *not* what I'd wanted to hear. 

Abruptly, the visitor's quick pulse vanished as if he had disappeared into thin air. Despite not hearing him anymore, I waited in tense silence, listening for any sign of movement. Eventually, I got brave enough to use my broom to break the salt line so that I could check through the peephole. To my relief, no one was there. 

I keep thinking about those thorns. How quiet they were. How if I hadn't been paying attention, I most likely wouldn't be here right now.

I'd figured that the Crowmaster would find out about my condition eventually, but I was hoping to have at least a week to get a better handle on how to proceed by then. Unfortunately, it hadn't taken him long at all. Worse yet, there is little I can do about it. Something like this is far beyond my capability. Even with the transformation, I know I won't be a match for what's coming for me. 

So what can I do? Wait for death to catch up to me before the Crowmaster can? Pray that another psychopomp somehow reaches me first? Assuming that another would come around. Or a better one. With my luck and personal history, I'd probably be able to count the devil as my only alternative.

*Shit.* I am in deep shit. 




**April 8th, 2024**

Ever since the night I died, I haven't eaten anything. I've tried. There was some ground beef in my freezer that I thawed out, hoping it would satiate me enough that the pulses around me wouldn't make my stomach rumble anymore. 

I couldn't keep it down. The moment the beef touched my tongue, I gagged, rushing over to spit it into the garbage can. Acidic, yet lifeless. Sour dirt. 

I must admit that death is beginning to appeal to me. A true death, not *this* bullshit. 

When it comes to my fate, I have reason to believe that if the Crowmaster took me, it wouldn't be a mercy. They’re known to be particularly sadistic when they find prey worth hunting. 

We never encountered them back in Ohio, but there were rumors to go along with all the records we have about these particular beings. Rumors of them spending months wearing their prey down, using various methods of physical and psychological torture. Stories of their unfortunate quarries being strung up by the ankles and carved up like hogs in a slaughterhouse. Whispered tales of their ability to mold human bodies, bending their bones and twisting organs to create the shapes they want. 

Something else that's occurred to me is that this could have been done to me. A punishment. Possibly from a relic. Even though I've done what I thought I had to stay out of their way, it might not have mattered. My profession automatically marks me as an enemy, in many of their eyes. Or I committed some egregious offense without realizing. 

Whether this happened as a result of my own actions or someone else's interference, I'm cursed either way. 

I've been going through potential solutions. One is drastic: suicide. As I am now, I am a danger to others, especially because of my position. The second is more feasible: control. I find a way to control the urges. Seek out alternatives to human meat. 

I'll have to get experimental. The ground beef was a bust. Perhaps it needs to be something fresher, not necessarily human. Luckily, there's a plethora of wildlife and livestock out here to choose from. Maybe one of them will work. 

I will update with the results.

1kefhmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1kefhmo/us_i_made_it_to_the_timeshare_presentation_club/,[US] I made it to the timeshare presentation club!,"At 40, I am finally part of the inside joke. Growing up in the 90s, everyone’s parents had their story about attending a timeshare presentation for a free… something. It was an American trait like owning Tupperware. I remember watching the South Park episode about it back in the day. I was always excited to someday go to one and hold my ground against a psychotic salesperson. Today, the wait finally ended.

Just to be clear, I have always known the presentations are a circus and a scam. I never expected to walk away with anything of value. This was my version of a comedy show. Anyway. On with the story.

Weeks ago, my wife and I were at the fair with our kids when we came upon a prize wheel. I let my son spin it. The woman there barely looked up to see where the wheel landed, but handed us a ticket and pointed to a tent for the prize. We walked over there and another woman had some printouts in battered page protectors about a three-night stay somewhere… if we attended a presentation. My wife is from another country and she looked skeptical, but I told her I would explain it all in the car. The woman gave me a blurry photocopied form to fill out. We picked a date and time and paid a $50 deposit, which she said I could only lose if I did not show up. Of course this was a gamble, but she also promised a $100 food voucher to sweeten the deal. She texted me the details with her personal phone.

It was at a hotel in the city. At the front desk, we showed our IDs and they told us the presentation would all take two hours. A guy came down to get us, then asked us where we drove in from and if we own or rent. He offered us snacks or drinks (we were told there would be food there, but I guess chips and coffee or soda were it), and then we sat down at a small table with him. We actually liked the guy. He made a bit more small talk while we waited for the main presentation to start.

There were a handful of these small tables in the room, with an individual salesperson at each. The main presenter came to our table before starting and gave us a paper to write questions on, saying he would have to move too fast to answer any with the whole group. His presentation was about what we expected. ~2000 properties worldwide, be a vacation owner not a renter, etc. Not a single dollar figure in the presentation. But he did take time to ask us open-ended questions like why we want to travel, and where to. So he would have had time for our questions, but he wanted to avoid us possibly asking about numbers.

That ended and it was back to our guy. He started asking about vacations we had taken. Then another guy walked up and jumped into the conversation, talking about how he himself was an owner. I had to interrupt a few times to pry some actual numbers out of him. Like $1300 a year in maintenance fees, which can increase up to 5% per year. My answer to it all was “no” in the first place, but yeah. No. He also showed some math of how he has saved over $2 million on hotels since becoming an owner. If I even spend $200 thousand on hotels in my lifetime, please punch me in the face.

After I declined a few times, they finally showed us an offer on paper. I barely looked at it, but they wanted something like a $4000 down payment today. The total investment, not including maintenance fees, was a five-figure number. That’s all I remember. I gave my final “no.”

The one who had stepped in walked away first, and our original guy showed us to another room. Someone we had yet to see asked us for feedback on who we had met with. We said nice things. He scratched out notes on a blank piece of printer paper. He said someone else would come give us our gift and he left the room. My wife and I were trying not to laugh.

A woman came in and gave us our hotel voucher. She said there were no blackout dates and we had a year to use it. It is a form we have to mail (USPS - snail mail) somewhere to request a reservation. Then she gave us four $25 restaurant cards, and $50 cash for our deposit. We were free to go.

The fine print on the back of the reservation form says it expires in 45 days, and it cannot be used within five days before or after a major holiday. So there’s that. As for the restaurant cards… they only work at a few obscure places. There is a website you have to go to and it shows you some deals where you can use the cards for a discount if you spend much more in the first place.

Ever sit down to work, only to find your mind wandering like a lost puppy? 🐶 You’re not alone! I used to swear by time blocking—those meticulously carved-out chunks of my day meant for laser-focused productivity. But let’s face it, sometimes it feels like I’m just staring at the clock, right? Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. 

Enter: **Energy Bundling**. ⚡ Seriously, this is the game-changer I didn’t know I needed! 

Here’s the lowdown: instead of fighting to stay focused in pre-scheduled time slots, why not align your tasks with your **natural energy levels**? It’s like flowing with the river instead of trying to swim upstream!

### So, what is Energy Bundling? 
Imagine grouping tasks based on how energized you feel throughout the day. 🏃‍♂️💨 

- **High Energy?** Crush that intense project or tackle a workout. 
- **Mid Energy?** Maybe it’s a great time for brainstorming or catching up on emails. 
- **Low Energy?** Perfect for simple tasks like organizing your desk or taking a leisurely walk.

### Why this works:
1. **Listen to Yourself**: Your body isn’t a machine, and trying to operate like one is exhausting! Some days I’m feelin’ like a superhero, and others, not so much. Embrace it!
2. **Avoiding Exhaustion**: Ever power through a time block only to find yourself staring blankly at a screen? Energy bundling lets you flow with your energy, so you’re more productive without burning out.
3. **Flexible Freedom**: Let’s be real: life happens. With energy bundling, you can adjust your plans on the fly. Got an unexpected surge of motivation? Jump into that talk you were dreading!

### A Quick Example from My Life: 
Last week, I had this *huge* project looming over me. Instead of blocking out two hours on my calendar (which usually ends up being a solid hour of scrolling), I tuned in to myself:

- **Morning**: Felt great, so I dove into the project without guilt.
- **Afternoon slump**: Switched gears to sip coffee and chat with my team. Fun win!
- **Evening**: Wrote down ideas for tomorrow’s tasks while winding down.

I’m not saying it'll be a perfect match every time, but hey—much better than the traditional route, right? 

So, what do you think? Have you tried mixing up your daily routine based on your energy? Or maybe you’ve got your own secret sauce to staying focused. Would love to hear what works for all of you! 💬✨

1kefg5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/vouchershunt/comments/1kefg5x/lets_share_working_fiverr_promo_codes_heres_whats/,Let’s Share Working Fiverr Promo Codes – Here’s What’s Valid in 2025 So Far,"Hey folks — if you’re like me and refuse to pay full price on Fiverr *ever*, you’re probably here hunting for a **Fiverr promo code that actually works in 2025**. Not expired. Not some scammy pop-up from a shady site. Just a real, working discount that doesn’t make you feel like a clown at checkout.

You’re in the right place.

Let’s cut the fluff and break down what’s still working, what isn’t, and how Reddit users (and yours truly) have been getting sneaky with Fiverr deals lately.

# ✅ First: The Good News

Fiverr *does* still run promo codes — especially for **first-time users** and **email subscribers**. Some of these are actually floating around Reddit and still working as of early 2025.

Here's what I've personally seen:

* **""FIVERR10""** – 10% off your first order
* **""WELCOME15""** – Occasionally pops up in email promotions (YMMV)
* **Referral trick** – Use a friend’s referral link and you both get up to **$100 in credits** depending on the offer
* **App-only codes** – Installing the Fiverr mobile app sometimes triggers a special offer banner (especially for first-timers)
* **Email abandoners bonus** – Add a gig to your cart, don’t buy, and Fiverr might email you a discount in a few days (this one’s hit or miss, but it’s worked for me twice)

# ❌ And the Bad News (Because We’re Honest Here)

Reddit's great, but some threads are **riddled with outdated codes**. A lot of posts from 2021 or 2022 still get upvoted even though the codes are long gone.

Here are a few that are definitely *dead*:

* ""FREEDOM10""
* ""SPRING20""
* ""BLACKFRIDAY25"" (obviously seasonal and expired)

If you’re seeing these pop up in older threads or shady sites — skip 'em. They’ll only waste your time and raise your blood pressure.

# 🔥 My Personal Fiverr Deal Hack (Totally Worked Last Week)

I wanted a quick logo refresh — nothing crazy, just a clean upgrade. Found a killer gig for $45.  
Used the **""FIVERR10""** code (yep, still valid in Jan 2025 for first orders).  
Bam. $4.50 off. Not earth-shattering, but enough to cover service fees and make me feel like a genius.

Also: the seller gave me an extra revision for free because I left a tip. So… double win.

# 🧠 Where Reddit Finds Fiverr Discounts

Reddit is a goldmine *if* you know where to look. I’ve found working Fiverr discounts in threads like:

* r/Frugal
* r/Freelance
* r/SideProject
* r/WorkOnline
* r/Entrepreneur
* r/couponcode

Use search terms like:

* ""Fiverr promo 2025""
* ""Fiverr working code""
* ""Fiverr new user discount""
* ""Fiverr referral Reddit""

**Then filter by “new”, not “top” — otherwise, you’ll be sifting through ancient history.**

# 💡 Pro Tips Before You Checkout

* **Try multiple codes** if you’re a new user. Sometimes they stack or auto-switch.
* **Clear your cookies or use incognito** if you’ve browsed Fiverr before — this can trick the system into giving you a “welcome back” promo.
* **Watch your email after browsing gigs** — Fiverr loves retargeting users with small discount offers within a day or two.

# 🧵 TL;DR for Scroll Skimmers:

* Try “FIVERR10” or “WELCOME15” for new users
* Referral links = $$$ credits for you and a friend
* Don’t trust old codes in top Reddit threads — always sort by new
* Check app banners or email for hidden promo offers
* Ghost your cart and maybe get a discount emailed later (works \~50% of the time)

I have a lowenstein prism CPAP issued by the NHS. At the time they said they wouldn’t be able to supply a humidifier, but I could buy my own. I soon worked out that I really needed it, so ordered one.

The humidifier does heat up properly, even when set to maximum settings. I still notice an improvement even just using the water tank unheated, so it is worth using regardless. I have been advised that the water should feel like a “warm to hot cup of coffee” when running at max. It’s never got above room temperature.

The humidifier unit has been sent back to the manufacturer and they confirmed that it is heating properly. They ran a test on it and confirmed that it reached 58C with no faults or leaks. It has now been returned to me.

I’d like to get it working, but presume that the fault is in the main CPAP unit. 

Has anyone come across this before? How can I solve this?

1kefee7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1kefee7/retail_job_called_me_into_office_for_extremely/,Retail job called me into office for extremely hostile interrogation after I have been injured.,"Location: Michigan, USA
Hello and thanks in advance.

TLDR: My boss got me a good raise, seemed to be suspended at least for it. I was targeted after to be pushed out, I then became injured via work (didn't threaten anything etc). Friday I was called in an interrogated by loss prevention police style (manipulation tactics) blamed for shrink somehow, and only evidence given was one instance of me taking a sip of expired product. I was suspended. Do I just quit? Lawyer? Injury claim worth the hassle? 

This story is long but im at a loss for what they are trying to do. I apologize for any grammar etc I am exhausted and just need help, thanks a ton.

I've been working at this job nearly 2 years (grocery store). I've never really had any issues. I was even asked if I was interested in promotion at one point and received several raises including a decent one recently. 
I've been punctual reliable etc never really been problems besides the typical ""3 strike"" system these jobs all seem to use as free excuses to fire.
Those are the only time I've been reprimanded it seems you always get 1 decently early. Mine was for customer complaint. The second usually signals your on your way out and I avoided that for ages.
This all really started when my old boss pushed through extra raises for the beet employees. These were in top of our yearly raises which I thought was oddly generous for retail, being in it so long and knowing the drill. 
Not long after he dissapeared and has still been on the schedule but everyone has been really tight lipped. I overheard some stuff and it seems like the raises may have ticked off people. 
Not long after I of course got my 2nd warning for being 20 minutes late (I called and said I'd be late before). So with the arbitrary reasoning etc i knew i was gonna be pushed out somehow.

My position is stocking and im one of 2 full timers and do a ton of stuff. It includes a lot of lifting very heavy cases etc including 50 pound ones solo. I'm not 100% sure but I recall in training we are supposed to team lift these due to the scenarios as its very awkward lifting to do by yourself. You are on a ladder and have to lift these heavy cases from shelves above you and (What i recall from training) hand them to someone else who places them on the table cart thing. 
However it seems everyone is expected to just do it solo which I didn't really care about being dumb and pretty strong etc. I even complained a bit before but it was shrugged off etc.
Not long after my 2nd warning all the repetitive wear and tear or something finally caught up and my back just got wrecked lifting stock back in February. I am not a complainer or whatever I know its dumb but I try to really a team member etc. I also have no experience with this type of thing so I figured if I made a big deal I'd just get demoted to part time at least. 
I've been really struggling though with the injury and I was actually about to ask for time off...but Friday I suddenly got called into the office. 

A woman was on a video chat and my new boas was sat with a notepad. She asked me if I knew why I was here and I immediately said yeah or course ive been really slow and looking injured and underperforming etc.
She said I dont know about that but I'm with loss prevention and we've had a shrink issue in your store and your name is what is most connected to it.
This REALLY blew my mind and came out of left field. I have never been in the trouble with the law once in my life or been fired for something like that etc anything. 
I also work stock so I'm aware of lot of stuff related to shrink especially spoilage/damage etc. So now im really confused and intrigued because I know for a fact there's no way I can be connected to shrink outside of just what I adjusted out and throw out etc which is clearly all on camera. The dumpsters even are on camera. 

She also began by saying ""we at company do not play the gotcha game""
But legit within 5 minutes I am now in a police style interrogation where she is asking me questions about spoilage and damage etc and im clearly giving very good answers that should clearly be on tape but she just keeps repeating the same question. I think she's a big true crime fan or something.
She also got very rude and condescending when I began to get emotional/break down. I've been absolutely exhausted etc and this situation is totally new to me etc and I know I havent stolen anything etc.
She finally asks me about coffee which I couldn't remember about and then she said ""you are on camera so and so date opening and taking a sip of this coffee"".
So then I remembered. It was expired product and I took like one sip and tossed it with the rest. This is something I legit rarely ever do i was just tired and wanted to try something that was getting thrown out. 
So then she says to my new boss to get the coffee, THEY SAVED IT. And it was indeed expired that day and had 1 sip missing. 

So im just at a loss as to why this is happening and she says ""you know we can mark that down and sell it at a discount, thays actually shrink."" And I dont even think that's true? It was expired. And I dont even understand what the big deal is. 
She also said that apparently a lot of spoilage can be donated and was interrogating why why I havent been doing that. I legit was never even told about that and I still dont understand cuz its expired and spoilage etc.

By this point i was beginning to lose it and stupidly said ""can you just fire me you're doing this because of my raise and my body is destroyed from this place can i just go"" or something like that. And I think maybe this was mt biggest mistake besides the last upcoming thing.
Cuz her demeanor really changed then and she said ""were done"" and that they were suspending me etc. Which i thought was very weird normally you just get fired from these places
Finally at the end they said I had one chance to make a written statement and it was the only imput I would have. I was legit freaked at that point and ive barely had any sleep I can't even remember what I wrote. I admitted to what I thought was the expired coffee but i could've been too vague. I'm so stupid for writing anything but ive seriously never been through this, am so worn out, and the interrogation was so intense I was legit having a breakdown.

After thinking about it all afternoon... I realized this store is also very lax about adjusting our damaged goodies and putting it in the break room etc. That's really not normally something done too much or at all but at this place its full of product from the store. 
Ive eaten it a ton and put it in my apron and ate it on the floor cuz ya know there's no time. 
My managers have also opened damaged or new product etc im not sure they even adjusted sometimes and just offered me stuff. 
I know ive also been forgetful or lazy and im sure ive left danaged product I found on the racks and forgotten to adjust etc. Or maybe forgotten to pay for something somehow a single time maybe if any?
I can't think of really anything I could've done to be connected to shrink its just extremely baffling and concerning.

I have considered just saying I want to quit because I think my rage comments make them think I will sue them for my injury or something. I'm afraid they are trying to piece together some wild story to charge me with something. But I also can't figure out how because if I have legit consumed product etc its been very sparingly outside of the break room stuff and it has always been damaged or ""expired"" (many things are fine). I really thought about it and it has to be very sporadic. 
I do know that our ordering system sucks especially the weird outside vendors. They seem to be taking advantage of the company and I spoil out A LOT of their stuff. The product they choose for us to carry makes no sense. 
I'm guessing this is the shrink they are talking about because there's no way I can be connected to anything else. I was meticulous about spoilage I would adjust everything perfectly and if I ever had a ton I would tell my manager etc before throwing it out because I know that stuff gets flagged. I will be clearly on camera doing all this and throwing it out etc.

I'm just at a total loss. Should I just quit? Is that what they want? Should I get a lawyer? I am legit injured pretty bad it would be obvious if I went to to doctor etc but honestly I just want to move on. I'm not a drama person and I dont think the hassle would be worth the tiny money but maybe im wrong.

This is just like the twilight zone for me and again I have never been in trouble for anything in any aspect of my life so any help would be appreciated.

1kefd6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeshareOwners/comments/1kefd6a/i_made_it_to_the_ive_been_scammed_club/,I made it to the “I’ve been scammed!” club!,"At 40, I am finally part of the inside joke. Growing up in the 90s, everyone’s parents had their story about attending a timeshare presentation for a free… something. It was an American trait like owning Tupperware. I remember watching the South Park episode about it back in the day. I was always excited to someday go to one and hold my ground against a psychotic salesperson. Today, the wait finally ended.

Just to be clear, I have always known the presentations are a circus and a scam. I never expected to walk away with anything of value. This was my version of a comedy show. Anyway. On with the story.

Weeks ago, my wife and I were at the fair with our kids when we came upon a prize wheel. I let my son spin it. The woman there barely looked up to see where the wheel landed, but handed us a ticket and pointed to a tent for the prize. We walked over there and another woman had some printouts in battered page protectors about a three-night stay somewhere… if we attended a presentation. My wife is from another country and she looked skeptical, but I told her I would explain it all in the car. The woman gave me a blurry photocopied form to fill out. We picked a date and time and paid a $50 deposit, which she said I could only lose if I did not show up. Of course this was a gamble, but she also promised a $100 food voucher to sweeten the deal. She texted me the details with her personal phone.

It was at a hotel in the city. At the front desk, we showed our IDs and they told us the presentation would all take two hours. A guy came down to get us, then asked us where we drove in from and if we own or rent. He offered us snacks or drinks (we were told there would be food there, but I guess chips and coffee or soda were it), and then we sat down at a small table with him. We actually liked the guy. He made a bit more small talk while we waited for the main presentation to start.

There were a handful of these small tables in the room, with an individual salesperson at each. The main presenter came to our table before starting and gave us a paper to write questions on, saying he would have to move too fast to answer any with the whole group. His presentation was about what we expected. ~2000 properties worldwide, be a vacation owner not a renter, etc. Not a single dollar figure in the presentation. But he did take time to ask us open-ended questions like why we want to travel, and where to. So he would have had time for our questions, but he wanted to avoid us possibly asking about numbers.

That ended and it was back to our guy. He started asking about vacations we had taken. Then another guy walked up and jumped into the conversation, talking about how he himself was an owner. I had to interrupt a few times to pry some actual numbers out of him. Like $1300 a year in maintenance fees, which can increase up to 5% per year. My answer to it all was “no” in the first place, but yeah. No. He also showed some math of how he has saved over $2 million on hotels since becoming an owner. If I even spend $200 thousand on hotels in my lifetime, please punch me in the face.

After I declined a few times, they finally showed us an offer on paper. I barely looked at it, but they wanted something like a $4000 down payment today. The total investment, not including maintenance fees, was a five-figure number. That’s all I remember. I gave my final “no.”

The one who had stepped in walked away first, and our original guy showed us to another room. Someone we had yet to see asked us for feedback on who we had met with. We said nice things. He scratched out notes on a blank piece of printer paper. He said someone else would come give us our gift and he left the room. My wife and I were trying not to laugh.

A woman came in and gave us our hotel voucher. She said there were no blackout dates and we had a year to use it. It is a form we have to mail (USPS - snail mail) somewhere to request a reservation. Then she gave us four $25 restaurant cards, and $50 cash for our deposit. We were free to go.

The fine print on the back of the reservation form says it expires in 45 days, and it cannot be used within five days before or after a major holiday. So there’s that. As for the restaurant cards… they only work at a few obscure places. There is a website you have to go to and it shows you some deals where you can use the cards for a discount if you spend much more in the first place. We tried to order at one place and it said our $25 card was worth 25,000 points, which was a $10 value.

I about died laughing when I realized the cards were a scam. This whole thing is real. These timeshare presentations actually happen.",3,1746348895.0,TimeshareOwners,1,1.0,False

Hi. First of all, I know this was reckless. I'm not usually like this but the situation, mixed with coffee-infused palpitation made me think this was okay. But I will never do this kind of thing in an uncontrolled environment. Note that this is my first time experiencing this since I got to driving for 15 years.

I had any traction control on, or whatever is the default. I didn't touch it so I was surprised by what happened. I thought it was just a strong force of turn (like what i experienced on a Honda City).

  
I would like to get your guidance in the event that this happens again. What should I do? What to mind to prevent it from happening, and what not to do during it. Also I'm not sure what will be the effect of this to my car in terms of wear and tear. Any parts I should take a look at? ",1,1746348762.0,Mustang,1,1.0,False

I’m now dealing with the consequences. So here’s the things I wish I was told. Especially in the current job market where employers expect a whole entire package.


1. Your grades matter. I’ve missed out on scholarships, research assistant positions, student clubs, semester abroad and internships at top companies due to my gpa. Keep it at least at 75% or even better an 80%.

2. Join student clubs related to your program/career interest. I had a recruiter from Nestle tell me they prefer hiring students involved in student clubs because it showcases their leadership and multitasking. P&G are a company that also wants to see leadership. Spoke with a consulting intern who got a job at BDO thanks to being part of the consulting student club at her school. 

3. Go and talk to your career coordinator. Show them that you want an internship. They will help you with your resume, cover letter, linkedin, coffee chats and so forth. You’ll want them to memorize your face and name. 

4. Participate in case competitions, boot camps and get certified. Especially if you are doing tech like me. You can tell the recruiter you know how to code all you want, but if they don’t see proof (e.g. projects, internship experience, proper certificates etc.) they don’t care. 

5. To add to point 4, basically every claim you make needs evidence. ""I have leadership skills"" where did you gain that? ""I can proficiently use Python."" show me a project you actually used it in. 

6. Talk to the students around you. Many times you will find yourself lost and confused. Your professors might not be able to help because they’re are hired to do research not really teach so the students in your program will help.

7. Read the newsletter your career coordinator sends you. Your career coordinator will probably send you weekly newsletter about events, internships and so much more. Read all of them. I once found that there’s a free trip to the Osaka(Japan) 2025 World Expo for business students especially anyone who launched and are passionate about entrepreneurship. 

8. Apply for research assistant roles. These are really good for your resume. Like really good. You will gain knowledge within your field, but you will stand out. Doing research will show employers that you are actually passionate about what you are majoring in.

9. Launch something. It doesn’t have to succeed but it will teach you some lessons and again will look good on your resume. And if it fails real bad simply don’t mention it. No one will ever know about it. 

10. Network with students outside of your major. Fashion major? Network with the communication and supply chain students. Business major? Network with the journalism students. CS student? Network with the HR majors.

9. Lastly, I know this might come off as a lot, but trust me in this current job market you will need the whole package. You won’t see the results of the networking, case competitions, boot camps, joining student clubs until maybe at least the summer before your third year. Make the most out of your university years. All of these things might seem “a lot” but these are the things that make university enjoyable. Not attending lectures and going home or to your dorm and sleeping is actually boring.

1kefbbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1kefbbj/got_married_a_week_ago_my_happy_am_experience/,"Got married a week ago, my happy AM experience","Feel free to AMA. 

I used to follow this sub a year ago, when I was getting ready to start on AM. Figured I’ll post my experience. 


Once I turned 25 (last year) my parents asked if I was interested in getting married. Due to good fortune, I already had my career & finances figured out by that time. I wanted to put effort into building my personal life, so I said yes. 


My parents introduced me to a girl, my parent’s friend’s daughter whom I’d never met due to circumstances.


We both met. She was also 25, works as a doctor, and was very pretty. She was also meeting someone for the first time.


Since it was our first time, neither of us knew what to expect, or how to proceed. I didn’t have a checklist, dealbreakers, filters, etc. neither did she. 


# First meeting: 

We just met, talked about random things. We were supposed to just meet for coffee, but it became lunch, dessert, etc and continued for hours. I’d laughed so much that afternoon, that I’d already made up my mind. Didn’t say anything though.


# Next several meetings: 

We met several times over the next month, got to know each other, and had lots of fun. But slowly the honeymoon phase started fading. We realized we did have dealbreakers, we just hadn’t figured it out yet. 


But we started working through them, one by one. Mostly just realizing, if X matters so much to the other person, a you barely care about X, it’s worth it to let things go. 


Example:
I was still friends with a very old ex, and she said she was fine with it. Eventually she realized she wasn’t okay with it. I thought about it, we were just namesake acquaintances at this point, and since it mattered so much to her, I went no contact. 


She used to bum her friend’s e-cigs occasionally. I realized I didn’t like it at all. She decided to never do it again. 


We still find differences, some we resolve. Some irreconcilable, but one of compromises.


# Yes to each other: 

About 1.5 months in, we told our parents that it’s a yes, and we wanted to get married. 

She or her parents hadn’t asked about my salary until then. Sounds ideal, but I assume this is because our parents knew each other and both our families come from money. 


Anyway I voluntarily shared all my financial info like salary package, etc. She shared hers too. She was and still has been completely uninterested in it. Mostly has the attitude “as long we have enough to be middle class happy”. I’m probably the luckiest guy on earth.


# Following months: 

We had to wait almost a year to get married, as her older sister had to get married first. 


But we spent a lot of time together, getting to know each other better, becoming intimate, etc. Went through ups and downs.


My role at my company got eliminated, I was through a very rough patch. She was super supportive, always re-assured that it wasn’t gonna affect our marriage no matter what. Her salary was enough for us temporarily anyway.


She encouraged me to pursue my startup ideas, since my job was eliminated. Though, I managed to find another role internally at my company. Things worked out, but it was a godsend to have a supportive person. 


At this point, we were deeply in love with each other. 


# Wedding season

This was a very rough patch. We got our worst fights at this point. Things were amazing when it was just us. But now we had her relatives, and my relatives poking their heads in. 


Me and her would discuss and make plan A, but due to relatives interference it’d become plan B. I’d be mad, or she’d be mad, because something was done by the other without discussion.



Eventually we managed to work it out though. We figured we really only cared about what happens afterwards. Got ourselves removed from the planning process, and gave all control to parents and relatives. 


We just smiled and did as we were told. 


Now we’re living together. It’s just been a week, but I’ve known her for over a year at this point. Life feels just right. 


It still feels wild how lucky we got, matching with each other on first try. But also I think, the lack of pre-conceived notions worked in our favor, helping us figure out what’s right for us.

I remember that izuku had a close relationship with shigaraki, dabi, shinsou and kurohige, this last one had something similar to a relationship with Compress and some scene where they insinuated that they fucked.

Shinsou joins them after Izuku helped him when he was kidnapped (they were both kidnapped) for hanging out with bad influences and told him something like being a villain he could also help.

I also remember shigaraki having Fluorescent Shining Stars in his room, many scenes of Izuku and Shoto being in a coffee shop venting about their abusive parents (All for One and Endeavor) and the league of villains watching bad American movies while All for One scolds them. Those are the scenarios I remember the most but not the only ones.

Where it ends (where I left off) Izuku after helping the league escape after retrieving Eri (and saying that Eri and shigaraki were brothers) is caught by the police and is awaiting trial. He and Shoto meet and the latter discovers that his friend was a villain.

The reason why I mentioned being a Spanish speaker is that I heard this FanFic on YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXQvK-Eiq0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXQvK-Eiq0) in 2020 and put it in private, my only knowledge is that the author didn't know that Kurogiri was Oboro (so it's before manga chapter 255 which came out on December 23, 2019) it was in English (because the one who uploaded it to Youtube said so in commentary) and that apparently it wasn't classified with gay ships.

I would appreciate your help at this point I am desperate.

We really had a good solid marriage going on so we recently attempted to test the waters opening the relationship slightly on her end first to add some excitement to our normal daily grind I guess. She talked to 3-4 guys for a week or so but that being said I wasn’t able to get comfortable with the idea so I called off her first and only date very soon, All cool right, not everything online is for all people. I was very clear that the game had ended and that maybe one day we could try again but not now. Fast forward two weeks and I get a weird feeling in the middle of the night so for the first time in our entire marriage I checked her phone. I found that she was still talking to one of the suitors and that they were actively attempting to meet up for a first time coffee meet up that day but missed due to my wife’s work schedule. I know for a fact just due to timeline and our travels lately there’s no chance she actually met him yet but she planned to. SO my question here is, I love my wife, we have a great marriage but she knowingly went behind my back talking to this guy and I’m thinking of leaving her I don’t need help with this. I’m already in such a hard spot adding the fact that If I choose I don’t want to stay I’m going to lose the opportunity to be the father I know my son deserves, not just a weekend warrior dad (absolutely no offense). If you want to just say this is my fault that’s fine too, I’d just like any advice how you would deal with this specifically with the child when deciding to stay.

I had ordered a bunch of coffees from Tulum roasters (I prefer light to light-medium roasts), just to start comparative tasting and improve my palette. 

**Methodology**

I used a 1:16.6 ratio for coffee grounds to water. For each coffee, I ground it to medium-coarse grind, which I usually use in my pourovers. Filled each cup with boiling water, and broke the crust after 4 minutes. After removing all the residual layer, I tasted it after 10 minutes. Before tasting, I mixed all the cups and rotated them until I couldn't identify which was which (I marked the bottom of the cups beforehand).

**Pulneys - dark roast**

It had an oily, chocolatey and sweet aroma. Low clarity, heavy body, low acidity, with moderate sweetness. The first note I got was oily. It's not my preference, but I think espresso loving people would like it. Very heavy sweetness, almost like honey and chocolate notes were there. It had a long, lingering aftertaste.

**Baarbara - medium-dark**

It had an oily, nutty and chocolatey aroma. Low clarity, very heavy body (almost syrupy) with a very low acidity. It was too oily, even more than Pulneys. The other note I could identify was nutty, with some sweetness. It had a long aftertaste.

**Thogarihunkal - medium**

It had a sweet, floral, tea-like aroma. Medium clarity, medium body and low acidity. Very floral notes, along with very sweet notes. A long aftertaste. Definitely ***my favourite*** of all the coffees tried today.

**Durgamadhaba - light medium**

It had a lemon grassy, citrusy aroma with some sweetness. Medium clarity, very low body and low acidity. It tasted weaker than others (even though I usually prefer light to medium-light roasts), and had a sweet note, along with little ctiric acidity. A short aftertaste.

I had a lot of fun doing this, and I'm planning to do it once a month or so with different coffees.",16,1746348029.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

What would you do?,"Ive been suffering with RJ since my husband and I got together 15+ yrs ago. My husband is super loyal and he has never done anything that would make me believe he’d go back with an ex. Im sure this stemmed from a mix of my own insecurities and being open to talk about me & my husband’s past relationships. I would constantly ask questions about his ex and look her up on social media. I made fake accounts to befriend her and some of her friends and family members. I have this made up idea in my head that she’s the perfect wife/mother/daughter. My husband found out about the fake accounts and made me delete them. RJ wasn’t as bad anymore since I wasn’t constantly looking at her social media. But recently I saw her at a coffee shop that I go to & have been seeing her more frequently. I started obsessing over her even more to the point where I would record whenever I would see her so I could see what outfits she wore so I can copy them. I would zoom into her face to see how she looked like and convinced myself that she’s prettier than me. I even followed her to see if she lived close by. I was going through a lot of stress a couple months ago which triggered my RJOCD & I decided to text my husbands ex that her current husband is cheating on her. She actually believed it. Long story short, she found out it was me….her and her husband confronted me about it in person when they saw me at the coffee shop. She said she had a feeling that I was following and recording her. I apologized and promised to never do that again. She kept asking why would I do that and I kept answering I don’t know bc I honestly didn’t know either. I hate RJOCD and how it’s taken over my mind. I was so embarrassed and ashamed that my RJ got so bad that it even got to this point. I’m seeing a therapist and am working on healing. I feel so ashamed and guilty for what I did that I’ve been thinking about reaching out to ask if she is open to have an open  & honest conversation about what happened. We left on bad terms and she kept asking why I did those things and my answers were I don’t know. I want to genuinely apologize & let her know that this stemmed from my own insecurities. If she doesn’t respond, then at least I know that I tried to reach out. I feel like doing this will help me, and I hope her as well, move on and heal.

I've asked chatGPT and it suggests this is something called sleep maintenance insomnia, which I've never heard before. I've never had problems getting to sleep (well aside from a few nights on an airbed but that's to be expected imo). Every night without fail I seem to wake up between 3-4.30am, and am awake for about an hour, sometimes I'll wake up again at either 6 or 7am and get a repeat. 

It doesn't matter how early I go to bed, if I shower before, don't do phone before, whether it's warm or cold (although if it's warm I'll wake up uncomfortable from sweating), I only drink decaf tea in the day, at latest 5pm, and never drink coffee, I've even started to take over the counter sleeping tablets once per week just to try to get one decent night's sleep a week and they don't work (I don't even feel drowsy when going to bed). I've lost about 10kg/22lbs since my peak as I thought that might be impacting my sleep quality. Alcohol makes things worse, it might help me get to sleep initially, but then I wake up needing the toilet and am awake 4am-7am, although it's very rare that I drink alcohol, maybe once per month or so. My issue seems worse on Sunday night/Monday morning, possibly anxiety about going to work the next day and oversleeping.

It's getting to the point where I'm either spending 12 hours in bed just to get 7 hours sleep, or having to take afternoon naps in order to give me the energy in the late afternoon / early evening otherwise I'm drowsy after work. I know I've got things on my mind at the moment for the past 6-8 weeks, but those don't seem to have made my problem worse, I'm processing them by journaling to clear my mind or have stepped up physical activity in the day to physically work out problems.

My question is, is sleep maintenance insomnia a condition that can be treated? All the articles seem to just talk about it rather than how to fix it, any any that do talk about insomnia are talking about the initial getting to sleep. I feel like I'm wasting most of my life trying to catch up on sleep.

For refence, I know I'm waking up at these times from my watch, which if anything seems to overestimate how much sleep I get, I've had multiple instances where it detects that I'm asleep while I'm driving or that I know that I was 100% awake",2,1746347790.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

I woke up this morning, a sight to behold,

With hair sticking up and a story untold.

My socks didn’t match, my coffee was cold,

My grand plans for the day, completely sold

To the duvet’s warm embrace, comfy and old.

I meant to eat healthy, a salad so green,

But a biscuit (or ten?) made a delicious scene.

My willpower, a myth, rarely ever seen,

Unless chocolate’s involved, then I’m suddenly keen

To finish the packet, making my waistline lean… the other way!

I scrolled through my phone for a minute or two,

Then three hours later, I was still seeing it through.

Comparison’s the thief of joy, it’s sadly true,

Looking at others and feeling quite blue,

While my own list of chores just grew and grew.

I promised I’d tidy, make everything neat,

But a wild dust bunny staged a strategic retreat.

My efforts were valiant, but faced with defeat,

I decided “tomorrow” would be oh so sweet

For tackling the chaos, from ceiling to feet.

I opened my mouth, and the words tumbled out,

Not quite what I meant, leaving listeners in doubt.

My filter is faulty, there’s no getting about,

Sometimes my brain takes a different route,

Resulting in comments that make people pout.

But hey, in this mess, there’s a little delight,

Acknowledging flaws with a humorous light.

We’re all a bit broken, not perfectly bright,

But owning the chaos feels strangely right,

So let’s laugh at ourselves, with all of our might!

No need for perfection, it’s frankly a bore,

Embrace the mistakes, and maybe a snore.

Just try a bit harder than you did before,

And if you mess up? Well, there’s always some more

1keeyh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalDeepResearch/comments/1keeyh1/the_fastest_research_workflow_quick_summary/,The Fastest Research Workflow: Quick Summary + Parallel Search + SearXNG,"
Hey Local Deep Research community! I wanted to highlight what I believe is the most powerful combination of features we've developed - and one that might be flying under the radar for many of you.

### The Magic Trio: Quick Summary + Parallel Search + SearXNG

If you've been using our system primarily for detailed reports, you're getting great results but might be waiting longer than necessary. The combination of Quick Summary mode with our parallel search strategy, powered by SearXNG, has transformed how quickly we can get high-quality research results.

### Lightning Fast Results

With a single iteration, you can get results in as little as **30 seconds**! That's right - complex research questions answered in the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.

While a single iteration is blazing fast, sometimes you'll want to use multiple iterations (2-3) to allow the search results and questions to build upon each other. This creates a more comprehensive analysis as each round of research informs the next set of questions.

### Why This Combo Works So Well

1. **Parallel Search Architecture**: Unlike our previous iterations that processed questions sequentially, the parallel search strategy processes multiple questions simultaneously. This dramatically cuts down research time without sacrificing quality.

2. **SearXNG Integration**: As a meta-search engine, SearXNG pulls from multiple sources within a single search. This gives us incredible breadth of information without needing multiple API keys or hitting rate limits.

3. **Quick Summary Mode**: While detailed reports are comprehensive, Quick Summary provides a perfectly balanced output for many research needs - focused, well-cited, and highlighting the most important information.

4. **Direct SearXNG vs. Auto Mode**: While the ""auto"" search option is incredibly smart at picking the right search engine, using SearXNG directly is significantly faster because auto mode requires additional LLM calls to analyze your query and select appropriate engines. If speed is your priority, direct SearXNG is the way to go!

### Setting Up SearXNG (It's Super Easy!)

If you haven't set it up yet, you're just two commands away from a vastly improved research experience:

```bash
docker pull searxng/searxng
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name searxng searxng/searxng
```

That's it! Our system will automatically detect it running at localhost:8080 and use it as your search provider.

### Choosing Your Iteration Strategy

**Single Iteration (30 seconds)** is perfect for:
- Quick factual questions
- Getting a basic overview of a straightforward topic
- When you're in a hurry and need information ASAP

**Multiple Iterations (2-3)** excel for:
- Complex topics with many facets
- Questions requiring deep exploration
- When you want the system to build up knowledge progressively
- Research needing historical context and current developments

The beauty of our system is that you can choose the approach that fits your current needs - lightning fast or progressively deeper.

### Real-World Performance

In my testing, research questions that previously took 10-15 minutes are now completing in 2-3 minutes with multiple iterations, and as little as 30 seconds with a single iteration. Complex technical topics still maintain their depth of analysis but arrive much faster.

The parallel architecture means all those follow-up questions we generate are processed simultaneously rather than one after another. When you pair this with SearXNG's ability to pull from multiple sources in a single query, the efficiency gain is multiplicative.

### Example Workflow

1. Start LDR and select ""Quick Summary"" 
2. Select ""searxng"" as your search engine (instead of ""auto"" for maximum speed)
3. Enter your research question 
4. Choose 1 iteration for speed or 2-5 for depth
5. Watch as multiple questions are researched simultaneously
6. Receive a concise, well-organized summary with proper citations

For those who haven't tried it yet - give it a spin and let us know what you think! This combination represents what I think is the sweet spot of our system: deep research at speeds that feel almost conversational.",2,1746347147.0,LocalDeepResearch,1,1.0,False

This time it has only been a couple of days and it went like the last time: Day 1 I had a splitting headache and was less anxious right away.

Before I was often close to tears because of feeling stressed and anxious, now I am feeling like crying cause of feeling so low. 
I wonder what my brain is lacking? 
Last try I held out over 6 months until it became unbearable. It never got better. So I tested it and had a coffee- BAM, the lights went on, I felt happy.
I don’t want to drink coffee, I don’t even like coffee! I just got into the habit of drinking it cause of long work hours and when it dawned to me I should quit because of anxiety I started to feel very very low.

If you’re like me, your morning isn’t complete without a protein-packed smoothie that fuels your day. But let’s be real—nothing kills the vibe faster than a blender that leaves chunks of kale or protein powder grit in your drink. *Ugh, no thanks.* I’ve tested a bunch of blenders to find the **best ones for protein smoothies**, and I’m spilling all the details—pros, cons, and my honest thoughts. Ready to blend like a pro? Let’s get into it!

# Why a Great Blender Matters for Protein Smoothies

Ever tried blending a smoothie only to end up with a sad, lumpy mess? Yeah, me too. A good blender isn’t just a kitchen gadget; it’s your ticket to creamy, dreamy smoothies that actually taste good. Protein smoothies often include tough ingredients like frozen fruit, leafy greens, or sticky nut butters, so you need a machine that can handle the heavy lifting. Here’s why the right blender is a game-changer:

* **Smooth Texture**: No one wants to chew their smoothie. A powerful motor and sharp blades ensure everything blends into silky perfection.
* **Time-Saver**: Quick blending means less time in the kitchen and more time crushing your day.
* **Versatility**: The best blenders can tackle more than just smoothies—think nut butters, sauces, or even frozen cocktails. *Margarita night, anyone?*
* **Easy Cleanup**: Dishwasher-safe parts or self-cleaning features save you from scrubbing nightmares.

So, what makes a blender stand out for protein smoothies? Let’s break down my top picks, complete with real-world testing and a sprinkle of my personal bias (because, duh, I have opinions).

# Top Cleveland-Style Top Blenders for Protein Smoothies: My Honest Reviews

I’ve put these blenders through the wringer—frozen berries, spinach, protein powder, you name it. Here’s the lowdown on the **must-have blenders** that’ll make your smoothie game unstoppable.

# 1. NutriBullet Pro 900 – The Compact Powerhouse

If you’re tight on counter space but still want a blender that packs a punch, the [NutriBullet Pro 900](https://www.amazon.com/NutriBullet-NB9-1301-Pro-13-Piece/dp/B07NBMWHDR?tag=fitness0582-20) is your new BFF. I’ve been using this bad boy for years, and it’s never let me down. With a **900-watt motor**, it obliterates frozen fruit and tough greens in seconds. Plus, it comes with two 32-ounce cups, so you can blend, sip, and go.

# Why I Love It

* **Super Portable**: The cups have to-go lids, perfect for rushing out the door. I’ve tossed mine in my gym bag with zero leaks.
* **Easy to Use**: No fancy buttons—just twist and blend. Even my half-asleep brain can handle it at 6 a.m.
* **Smooth Results**: My go-to smoothie (banana, spinach, protein powder, almond milk) comes out creamy every time. No grit, no chunks.
* **Affordable**: At around $100, it’s a steal for the power you get.

# The Not-So-Great

* It’s **not great for large batches**. If you’re blending for the whole family, look elsewhere.
* The cups are plastic, which feels a bit less luxe than glass. Still, they’re durable and BPA-free.

**Rhetorical Question**: Ever wished you could blend a smoothie and *not* spend 10 minutes cleaning up? The NutriBullet’s dishwasher-safe cups are a lifesaver.

*Pro Tip*: Add a drop of dish soap and water, then blend for 30 seconds for a quick clean. You’re welcome. :)

# 2. Vitamix 5200 – The Luxury Beast

Okay, let’s talk about the [Vitamix 5200](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-5200-Blender-Professional-Grade-Container/dp/B008H4SLV6?tag=fitness0582-20). This thing is the Rolls-Royce of blenders, and yeah, it comes with a price tag to match (around $400). But hear me out: if you’re serious about smoothies (or just love flexing your kitchen gear), this is **the one**. I borrowed a friend’s Vitamix for a week, and I’m still dreaming about it.

# Why I Love It

* **Insane Power**: The **2-horsepower motor** laughs at frozen strawberries and kale. I blended a smoothie with whole almonds, and it was smoother than my best pickup lines.
* **Variable Speed Control**: You can fine-tune the speed for perfect texture. Want a thicker smoothie? Crank it down. Need it silky? Go full throttle.
* **Huge Capacity**: The 64-ounce container is ideal for meal-prepping smoothies forPowered by the week.
* **10-Year Warranty**: This thing is built to last. You’ll be blending smoothies for your grandkids.

# The Not-So-Great

* It’s **pricey**. If you’re not blending daily, it might feel like overkill.
* It’s loud. Like, wake-the-neighbors loud. I suggest blending when no one’s sleeping.
* The size is bulky—clear some counter space.

**Sarcasm Alert**: Want to spend your life savings on a blender? The Vitamix is worth every penny, but maybe don’t tell your bank account I said that. :/

# 3. Ninja Fit Compact Personal Blender – The Budget-Friendly Champ

On a budget but still want a blender that doesn’t suck? The [Ninja Fit Compact Personal Blender](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Personal-Blender-Smoothies-QB3001SS/dp/B075MXL3R4?tag=fitness0582-20) is my go-to recommendation for anyone starting their smoothie journey. At under $60, it’s a **steal** for the performance. I gifted one to my sister, and she’s obsessed.

# Why I Love It

* **700-Watt Motor**: Don’t let the small size fool you—it crushes ice and frozen fruit like a champ.
* **Two 16-Ounce Cups**: Perfect for single servings, with sip-and-seal lids for on-the-go.
* **Compact Design**: It fits in tiny kitchens (or dorm rooms). My sister keeps hers next to her coffee maker.
* **Easy Cleanup**: Everything but the base is dishwasher-safe. Hallelujah!

# The Not-So-Great

* It’s **not as powerful** as the NutriBullet or Vitamix. Tough ingredients like raw carrots need a bit more time.
* The cups are smaller, so you might need to blend twice for bigger smoothies.

**Rhetorical Question**: Why spend a fortune when you can get smoothie perfection for less than your monthly coffee budget?

[Buy It: Ninja Fit on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Personal-Blender-Smoothies-QB3001SS/dp/B075MXL3R4?tag=fitness0582-20)

# 4. Beast Mini Blender Plus – The Instagram-Worthy Option

If aesthetics matter as much as performance, the [Beast Mini Blender Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Beast-Blender-Toke-Performance-Aesthetics/dp/B0C9J4S5Y8?tag=fitness0582-20) is calling your name. This blender went viral for its sleek, fluted glass cups and chic design. I tested it for a month, and while it’s not perfect, it’s a solid choice for smoothie lovers who want their kitchen to look Insta-ready.

# Why I Love It

* **Gorgeous Design**: The glass cups with silicone bases are grippy and feel luxe. I get compliments every time I use it.
* **600-Watt Motor**: It handles protein shakes and fruit smoothies with ease. My berry smoothie was smooth, though kale left a tiny bit of grit.
* **Versatile Accessories**: Comes with three cup sizes, storage lids, and a straw lid. Perfect for sipping at the gym or office.
* **Quiet Operation**: It’s way less noisy than the Vitamix. My roommates thank me.

# The Not-So-Great

* It’s **less powerful** than the NutriBullet Pro. Don’t expect it to pulverize nuts or seeds flawlessly.
* The glass cups are heavier than plastic, which might bug you if you’re toting it around.

**Humor Alert**: Want a blender that makes your kitchen look like a Pinterest board? The Beast is your guy, but it’s more about style than raw power.

# How to Choose the Perfect Blender for You

Picking a blender is like choosing a workout buddy—you need one that fits your vibe. Here’s a quick guide to help you decide:

* **Budget**: If you’re balling on a budget, go for the **Ninja Fit** or **NutriBullet Pro 900**. They deliver without breaking the bank.
* **Power Needs**: For tough ingredients or daily blending, the **Vitamix 5200** or **NutriBullet Pro 900** are your best bets.
* **Portability**: Need a blender for the gym or office? The **Ninja Fit** or **Beast Mini** have travel-friendly cups.
* **Aesthetics**: If you want a blender that doubles as decor, the **Beast Mini** is your stylish sidekick.
* **Batch Size**: Blending for one? Any of these work. For big batches, the **Vitamix 5200** is king.

**Rhetorical Question**: What’s the point of a blender if it can’t keep up with your smoothie obsession?

# Tips for Making Killer Protein Smoothies

Your blender’s only half the equation. Here’s how to level up your smoothie game:

* **Layer Smart**: Liquids first, then soft ingredients (like banana), followed by frozen fruit or ice, and powders last. This helps the blades work efficiently.
* **Don’t Overfill**: Overloading your blender is a recipe for disaster. Stick to the max fill line.
* **Add Healthy Fats**: A spoonful of almond butter or avocado makes your smoothie creamier and keeps you full longer.
* **Experiment**: Try adding oats, chia seeds, or even a pinch of cinnamon for extra flavor and nutrition.

*FYI*: I once added too much protein powder and ended up with a smoothie that tasted like chalk. Less is more, trust me.

# Wrapping It Up: Blend It, Sip It, Love It

So, there you have it—my honest take on the **best blenders for protein smoothies**. Whether you’re Team Budget with the **Ninja Fit**, Team Fancy with the **Vitamix 5200**, or somewhere in between with the **NutriBullet Pro 900** or **Beast Mini**, there’s a blender out there that’ll make your mornings smoother (pun intended). IMO, the NutriBullet Pro 900 is the sweet spot for most people—powerful, portable, and wallet-friendly.
