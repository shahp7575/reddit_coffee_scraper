## The Problem We All Face

Picture this: You're debugging a SwiftUI view at 2 AM, and somehow your loading spinner is showing while your error message is also visible. Your success state is active alongside your loading state. Sound familiar?

We've all been there with code like this:

```swift
@State private var isLoading = false
@State private var showError = false  
@State private var isLoggedIn = false
@State private var hasValidInput = false
@State private var showSuccess = false
```

Multiple boolean flags creating ""impossible"" states that somehow still happen anyway. 😅

## The Solution: State Machines

Instead of juggling a bunch of booleans that can create chaos, model your actual UI states:

```swift
enum LoginState {
    case idle
    case validating
    case loading
    case success
    case error(String)
}
```

Now your UI can only be in ONE state at a time. No more ""loading while showing error while validating"" nonsense.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide, I break down:

🔧 **Building Your First State Machine** - Transform that messy login view step-by-step

🌍 **Real-World Patterns** - Data loading, form validation, shopping carts, and more

🚀 **Advanced Techniques** - State composition, testing strategies, and performance tips

⚡ **When NOT to Use Them** - Because not everything needs a state machine

## Why This Matters

State machines aren't just clean code (though that's nice). They make your app behave the way humans expect:
- When something is loading, it's just loading
- When there's an error, it's just an error  
- No mixed messages, no confusion

Your QA team will find logical bugs instead of impossible state combinations. Your users get predictable, reliable experiences.

1lqo4pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1lqo4pu/online_dating_and_gauging_attraction_from_photos/,Online dating and gauging attraction from photos. Feeling conflicted.,"So I’ve been using online dating (mainly Hinge & Bumble) for a few months now. The only person I dated that I really hoped there’d be a connection with decided not to continue it further after a couple of dates.

The thing I’m feeling conflicted about is considering whether to meet people that I’m not completely sure I’d be attracted to. For example, I regularly see profiles on Hinge and from about 3/4 of the photos I think she looks nice, then a couple of the other photos put me off. 

I tend to skip these profiles, but part of me thinks what if I meet them in person and the attraction grows? However, the other part of me thinks what if I meet them and I was correct in thinking the attraction isn’t quite there. 

It probably comes across that I’m an over-thinker, but I don’t want to lead anyone along and hurt their feelings. I guess if I don’t meet them I’ll never know though!

Just to add that I tend to do a coffee/go for a walk as the first date, so it wouldn’t be a massive time commitment for either of us.

Does anyone else struggle with this or am I overthinking it too much?",1,1751545165.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I had fought off rogues to save him from bites, endured wolfbane brewed by witches, and even during his in heat, I had even played the role of his mate. 

Even when his new lover was kidnapped by enemies, it was me he sent as the hostage for the exchange.

Everyone thought I was hopelessly in love with Erevan.

After all, our wolves had recognized each other the moment we met. But he loathed such primal instincts and refused to

acknowledge me as his mate. Still, I chose to stay by his side–without a name, without a title.

Even as one lover after another came and went, I remained. My daily job was to manage the chaos they left behind.

And the first time he truly looked at me was when that delicate Omega sobbed.

That was when he ordered me to go in her place for the exchange, tossing out a casual promise that he’ll mark me as

compensation.”

But after I returned, broken and bleeding from seven days and nights of torment, his first words weren’t about my injuries. 

He just ordered me to get back to work.

Erevan stood shirtless, each breath tightening his abs, like something savage and caged just beneath his skin, ready to break

free. 

He was pressing Virelle against the floor–to–ceiling window of his office, whispering the sweet nothings lovers share.

“Sweetheart, I bought you that pink diamond necklace you liked. Just a hundred million–no big deal.”

I stood at the door, face calm. Inside, I felt nothing.

For seven whole days, not even ten million could be scraped together for my ransom.

So it was Erevan deliberately had let the captors torture me longer on purpose.

My knee had only just been reattached by healing magic. The whip marks on my back, the knife scars on my hands–new skin had barely grown over them. They still stung.

But it was fine.

I was about to quietly retreat when I heard his voice, sharp and commanding.

“Stop.”

Erevan glanced at me. 

“There’s a new café downstairs. Virelle wants coffee. Now that you’re back, go get her some. You’ve got ten minutes.”

He gave the order with practiced ease. I nodded with the same mechanical grace.

9 minutes, 42 seconds.

I returned carrying ten different flavors of coffee, pale from the effort.

Virelle had dressed, though her blouse hung open to reveal a trail of hickeys she flaunted with pride.

And my arm, lifting the coffee bags, showed scabbed–over wounds beneath the sleeve.

“It took you long enough. They’re cold now.”

Virelle pouted.

After I reheated them, she grabbed a cup, pretended to fumble, and spilled it on me–right on my open wounds.

She covered her mouth, gasping in feigned horror.

Erevan rushed over when he heard the commotion. His eyes skimmed over me, then softened with concern for Virelle.

“Did it burn you?”

She nodded pitifully.

And Erevan grabbed the rest of the coffee and poured it over my head.

My white shirt soaked instantly, clinging wetly to my skin.

“You can’t even handle this? Liora, this is your punishment.”

The liquid dripped down my bangs, stinging my eyes, blurring my vision.

That made me could barely make out his furious face.

Two seconds later, I bowed my head actively.

“I’m sorry.”

I’d apologized, but instead of softening, his expression turned colder.

That night, Erevan had a formal banquet.

In the past, I had always been the one to accompany him to these business functions. But this time, he brought Virelle too.

He must’ve really liked her.

When choosing my dress, I picked a long–sleeved gown that covered all my wounds.

Erevan frowned. “Why are you wrapped up like that?”

Before I could explain, he added, “Whatever. You’re just Virelle’s background tonight anyway. I don’t need you making an impression like you used to.”

The banquet hall buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses. Many guests came to toast Erevan.

Virelle shrank into his arms, shy and helpless.

“Erevan, I can’t drink…‘

He caressed her gently. “It’s okay, baby. Someone else can drink for you.”

I said nothing, silently accepting glass after glass of red wine and champagne from his business partners.

Once, I only drank for Erevan. Now, I drank for Virelle too.

My stomach burned, cramps twisting inside me.

I barely winced from the pain, but Erevan sharply noticed.

“What’s the matter? I thought you could handle your liquor. Only a few dozen glasses and you’re already tapping out?”

An older Alpha across the table laughed. “Come on, Liora’s known for her drinking. Don’t tell me you’re disrespecting me?”

Erevan’s gaze was icy.

“Liora, apologize to Mr. Gideon. If he’s not pleased tonight, don’t bother showing your face at the Rosenoir Pack tomorrow.”

Mr. Gideon’s greedy eyes dropped to my chest.

“Erevan, you’ve already got a beauty by your side. Why not lend Liora to me for one night?”",1,1751545009.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1lqo2a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lqo2a4/i_think_my_married_neighbor_40f_is_trying/,I think my married neighbor (40F) is trying something with me (24M) and I might be catching feelings.,"I (24M) moved into a rented flat in a metro city (India) a few months ago after getting a job. I share the place with Deep (name changed) a guy I met during our office training. We clicked quickly and decided to split rent and groceries.
Our building has two flats per floor. Opposite ours lives a family of three. A man in his late 40s their 11th-grade son and Rekha (name changed) the wife. She’s probably in her early 40s around 5’2 fair average-looking but has this warm and kind vibe when she talks.
Initially she just smiled in passing. Then one day she introduced herself asked where we were from and told us to knock if we ever needed anything. The next morning she brought us breakfast. Felt like she saw us as kids living away from home.
From there it picked up. We’d chat casually. Since our doors face each other it became regular. She started sending food often. Chole bhature paneer sweets. Said she made extra. Deep joked that she’d adopted us.
Then something weird happened.
One weekend we went to a nearby cafe. We saw Rekha there with another man. Not her husband. They were holding hands. She noticed us and immediately pulled away. Next day she came by with dahi puri and casually said she saw us at the café the day before when she had been there with her brother. Nobody bought that. The body language was very much not sibling energy.
Another night I came home late around 1 AM after my night shift, I saw her on the terrace whispering on a phone call and glancing around nervously. Deep later said he’d seen her doing that too always when her family was home.
Fast forward. Our work shifts changed. I had morning WFH Deep was on night shifts. Rekha must’ve noticed.
One night around 11 PM she knocked on our door. Asked if I had eaten or was sleeping. I said no. She peeked inside and asked if Deep was home. I said he was on night shift. She smiled and said come to the terrace get some fresh air. She said we IT guys do not go out enough.
It felt random. But I went.
She was in a nighty with a sweater on. Her eyebrows looked freshly shaped lips had balm or gloss and her skin looked soft under the terrace light. She talked about gossiping neighbors and how the women in the building form cliques. Then she asked about my family my parents and if they were visiting. It was casual but weirdly intimate. Around midnight I said I should sleep. She smiled and said you’re working from home no sleep a little more. I said it’s still a job.
I asked if her family ever questions her being on the terrace late at night. She chuckled and said her husband knew and didn’t care.
Then she ignored me for a few days. No smiles no eye contact. Deep said maybe she was testing me. I honestly didn’t know.
Then one day she knocked again. Deep and I were both home. She asked about our Wi-Fi setup but only spoke to Deep. Wouldn’t even look at me. It felt deliberate. Then later that same evening after Deep left for his shift Rekha called me.
She said you free can you come over for a bit.
She ignored me a few hours ago and now was calling me?
I went. Her son was at tuition husband still at work. Music was playing on her TV.
She was wearing a short T-shirt and loose pajama pants,  a style she’d never worn before, at least not around me. It was the first time I noticed something different. Just a little skin of her waist was visible. Then when she reached up to grab something, her T-shirt lifted slightly and her waist showed even more. She said she needed help getting some boxes down from the shelf. I stood up to assist, but my mind was already somewhere else. Maybe I was observing a lot.. maybe she wanted me to see it..? 
I helped her out and when I finished
She patted my waist and smiled. “Strong guy” she said. Her hand stayed there for a moment longer than it needed to. Just rested. Then brushed it off like nothing.
She offered coffee. I said sure.
While she made it I sat in the hall watching her. She was humming with the music. Swaying slightly. Her hips moving with the rhythm. It felt natural but also like she knew I was watching. I didn’t want to stare but I kept looking.
We sat on opposite sides of the sofa. Had coffee. She asked how old I was. If I had marriage plans. Joked if my parents were going to pick someone or if I’d already found someone. I said I was single.
I made some lame jokes. She laughed more than expected.
Then her tone shifted. She said my husband is too serious. He’s not fun to be around. Relationships are hard these days.
I said that’s sad you deserve better.
She looked right at me. Held eye contact for just a bit longer than usual. Neither of us said anything for a few seconds. There was a weight in the silence. Then she looked away.
A moment later she said her son would be back soon. I should go.
So I did.
A few hours later I saw her again. This time she’d changed into a longer T-shirt. Same pajamas. Was it just because she had been working or had she dressed lighter before for me to see
Then again she ignored me. Two three days. Cold.
Recently, I caught a bad fever. Deep went to her place to ask for paracetamol. She came herself.
She asked if we’d eaten gave me the medicine and told me to rest. Then told Deep to get water and cloth. Said she’d do a cold press on my forehead.
She sat beside me. Her hand cool against my skin. She moved slowly gently dabbing my forehead. I was burning up and drowsy but the way she touched me felt soothing and almost affectionate. I fell asleep.
When I woke up around 3 PM she was there. She had made chapaties and told me I had to eat and take more meds.
She touched my forehead and then under my chin. Checked the fever. Her hand was soft and lingered for a second longer than usual. Deep stood behind her and gave me this smirk. I smiled.
She caught that and slapped my thigh lightly. Said stop smiling.
She said she’d feed me. I said I could eat myself but she already had a bite ready. Said otherwise I’d have to get up to wash my hands. I opened my mouth and ate.
She kept feeding me. Sitting close. It felt like a moment only we were in.
At one point she said if I had a daughter I’d keep her far away from you boys.
Deep joked that we were just shy. Not used to all this. 
Then he had to leave for work, as his shift was in a few hours.
Now it was just me and her.
After I finished eating she poured water on my hands right there in the plate and washed them. Took a towel and dried them herself. It felt caring and Maybe too personal.
Then she leaned in and said next time don’t fall sick when Deep’s around. He’ll tease us. Then she said if you ever need me I’m right here.
The way she said it sent chills down my spine. Not fever chills. The other kind. My entire body warmed up.
I was hard. 
And yeah I think I have a crush on her now.
I can’t stop thinking about her.
I keep thinking about that “brother” she was with. 



I feel like she’s cheated before. It just feels likely.

>Hi everyone! My name is Sarah Miller, and if you'd seen me a few months ago, you would have found someone who was constantly dragging themselves around. Waking up was already a sacrifice, energy seemed to disappear before lunch, and that constant brain fog prevented me from being productive and enjoying life. Coffee? It became my best friend, but the effect was fleeting and left me even more exhausted afterward. I knew I needed something more, something that truly nourished my body. It was while researching natural solutions to increase vitality that I came across **Tonic Greens**. The idea of a ""shot"" of green superfoods seemed exactly what my body was asking for.  
  
**Does Tonic Greens Really Work?**  
  
Being 100% honest, skepticism hit hard at first. So many products promise the moon and stars, right? But, to my immense surprise and joy, the answer is a resounding YES! Tonic Greens really works. It wasn't an overnight miracle, but after a week of consistent use, I started to notice I was waking up with more energy. That chronic fatigue began to diminish, and the brain fog started to clear.  
  
[**(➡️ CLICK HERE FOR OFFICIAL WEBSITE ⬅️)**](https://tonic.phytogreens.net/vslv1/?aff_id=177047&subid=rdit3julvk)  
  
**Is Tonic Greens Good?**  
  
Good? It's much more than good, it's a nutritional lifesaver! What Tonic Greens has done for my energy and overall well-being is something I haven't felt in years. My body feels lighter, my digestion has improved considerably, and that feeling of always being ""heavy"" has disappeared. My skin looks more vibrant, and even my mood has improved. It's as if my body is finally receiving the nutrients it was missing.  
  
**How Does Tonic Greens Work?**  
  
From what I understand and have experienced firsthand, Tonic Greens is a concentrated nutrient bomb. It combines a variety of green superfoods, fruits, vegetables, herbs, and probiotics that work together to detoxify the body, strengthen the immune system, improve digestion, and most importantly for me, boost energy levels naturally and sustainably. It's like giving your body a ""makeover"" of essential vitamins and minerals.  
  
[**(➡️ CLICK HERE FOR OFFICIAL WEBSITE ⬅️)**](https://tonic.phytogreens.net/vslv1/?aff_id=177047&subid=rdit3julvk)  
  
**Is Tonic Greens Worth It?**  
  
Considering how much I used to spend on specialty coffees, energy drinks, and how much my lack of energy impacted my productivity and quality of life, the investment in Tonic Greens was worth every penny, and much more! The benefit of feeling genuinely well, with clean and lasting energy, is priceless. If you're looking for a practical and effective way to improve your overall health, it's definitely worth it.  
  
**Tonic Greens Benefits?**  
  
The benefits accumulated impressively. The main one, of course, was the drastic and sustained increase in my energy. But I also noticed a significant improvement in my digestion, less bloating, and more regularity. My mind feels clearer and more focused. I feel my immune system is stronger – I went through the last winter without catching a single cold! And, as a bonus, my skin has a healthy glow that I used to only achieve with a lot of makeup.  
[**(➡️ CLICK HERE FOR OFFICIAL WEBSITE ⬅️)**](https://tonic.phytogreens.net/vslv1/?aff_id=177047&subid=rdit3julvk)  
  
**Tonic Greens Pros and Cons?**  
  
**Pros:**  
  
Significant and natural increase in energy levels.  
Noticeable improvement in digestion and reduction in bloating.  
Strengthens the immune system.  
Greater mental clarity and focus.  
Formulated with a rich blend of natural superfoods.  
Pleasant taste (at least for me, and easy to mix).  
Contributes to an overall sense of well-being and vitality.  
  
**Cons:**  
  
The ""green"" taste might not appeal to everyone immediately, but it's easy to get used to or disguise in smoothies.  
The most significant results come with consistent, daily use.  
It's important to purchase from the official website to ensure quality and authenticity.  
  
**Buy Tonic Greens!**  
  
  
If you're tired of feeling low on energy, with a weakened immune system, and are looking for a natural and effective way to nourish your body, my recommendation is, without a doubt: Buy Tonic Greens! It was one of the best investments I've made in my health.

**How to Incorporate Tonic Greens into Your Routine**  
  
Incorporating **Tonic Greens** into my morning routine was incredibly easy. I simply mix one scoop of the powder into a glass of cold water right when I wake up, even before coffee. Sometimes, for a change, I add it to a fruit smoothie. It takes no more than a minute and already gives me the feeling of starting the day in the healthiest way possible.  
  
This decision to try Tonic Greens transformed my days. I went from being a person who dragged themselves around to someone with vibrant energy, a clear mind, and a sense of well-being that radiates. If you also want this transformation and to feel the power of green superfoods in your life, don't wait any longer. **Click the link below and get your Tonic Greens from the official website.** You deserve to feel your best every day!

2 of us (adults with no kids) will be at our first Disney vacay soon , while we’re spending plenty of time in the parks, we’ve built in a few “down days” to explore the resorts and just soak up that Disney atmosphere. We’re **staying at an official Disney Springs-area partner hotel**, so no room key or related perks—just regular park guests getting around on Disney transportation (can rent a car if needed).

**Our vibe:**

* Two adults (early-40s), love pretty spaces, chill lounges, fun Disney decor & details, and unique little experiences.
* Strict vegetarians (no meat or seafood) but we’re happy to snack on iconic desserts, mocktails, shareable sides, or anything non-meat that’s worth the calories.
* Not chasing character meals or $$$ fine-dining—more “wow, this lobby is gorgeous” or “this quick-service has a sleeper-hit veggie option.”

**What we’re hoping to learn from you kind folks:**

1. **Is resort hopping still doable for us non-resort guests?** *Transportation hacks, best times of day, any resorts that are stricter about parking/security, etc.*
2. **Must-see lobbies, lounges, or chill corners** *Places to sit with a coffee or dole whip and just… take it all in.*
3. **Unique free/low-cost experiences** *Fire-pit s’mores, live music, hidden trails, art tours, animals at AKL, movies under the stars—hit us with your favorites!*
4. **Vegetarian-friendly snacks or desserts** *Think Dole Whip flavors, vegan soft-serve, specialty cupcakes, seasonal treats, mocktails—whatever makes you say “YES, go out of your way for this.”*
5. **Transportation joy-rides** *Monorail loop, Skyliner crawl, Sassagoula boat ride—any clever itineraries or scenic routes for an afternoon/evening?*
6. **Anything else we might overlook** *Photo spots, resort-only merch, lobby entertainment, interactive things, etc.*

**Quick FYIs about us:**

* We’ll rely on Disney transport but can rent car if parking is easy.
* Vegetarians (does not have to be Vegan) and not big on alcohol, but mocktails and other beverages would be great .
* Dates: **early August** (yes, we’re ready for the heat—and the free lobby A/C 😅).
* Budget: Cheap-to-moderate is perfect unless something is truly next-level.

Throw all the hot tips, secret spots, and veggie snack recs our way! Thanks in advance for helping us make our downtime as magical as our park days. 🌟

*TL;DR:* Off-site duo want to resort hop: Where should we go, what should we do, and what vegetarian treats shouldn’t we miss?

1lqnwjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1lqnwjl/tips_for_socializing/,Tips for Socializing,"Hi all,

I’ve been doing some reflection on my social relationships, and I’ve realized that most of my long-term social relationships have been with people from either high school or college clubs/roommates. Although I feel like I have many of these social relationships, anytime I’m in a new group in a new environment, I feel like a complete awkward mess with no idea how to get myself established in a group. I also feel like I’m relatively empty from a social standpoint; I’d like to interact with people, I love being in spaces with people around even if I’m not interacting (like reading books at coffee shops), but when it comes to talking to someone, I feel like I have no interest or curiosity about someone else to be “social”. As contradicting as this might sound, I feel like at least part of the difficulty is that I don’t think I’ve practiced developing social circle in completely new and unfamiliar environments.

I’m reading up on this and also putting myself in social situations and working up the courage to practice feeling uncomfortable and having casual conversation with people. In the meantime, does anyone have any similar experiences and stories of how y’all grew through this feeling?",1,1751544481.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

""You know she's not worth your tears, right?"" 

I push my glasses up my nose and hand Liam another tissue. He's sprawled across my couch, red-eyed and disheveled, looking nothing like the confident talent manager who strides through music production studios making deals. Right now, he's just a mess of a man nursing a broken heart—again. 

""She's engaged, Aurora."" His voice cracks. ""Selena is actually marrying someone else."" 

My stomach knots with conflicting emotions. On one hand, I want to comfort my best friend. On the other, a shameful spark of joy flickers in my chest. Selena Beaumont has finally, truly, moved on. 

""Maybe it's for the best,"" I say, perching beside him. ""You've been on this rollercoaster with her since high school."" 

Liam runs his hands through his sandy brown hair, making it stand up in tufts. ""Ten years, Rory. Ten years of my life, just... gone."" 

Ten years. The exact amount of time I've been waiting in the wings, loving him silently. 

""When's the wedding?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice neutral. 

""Three weeks. Some destination thing in Asheville. Apparently, Julian proposed with a five-carat diamond after dating her for six months."" 

I bite my lip. ""Julian?"" 

""Julian Croft. Investment banker. Drives a Tesla."" Liam's voice drips with disdain. ""Probably has a perfect credit score and flosses twice a day."" 

Despite everything, I laugh. ""The monster."" 

A ghost of a smile touches his lips before vanishing. In the dim light of my apartment, his jawline looks even sharper, his green eyes more intense despite their redness. I've memorized every plane of his face over the years, cataloging changes like a scientist documenting a rare specimen. 

""What am I going to do, Rory?"" he asks, leaning his head against my shoulder. ""I can't keep doing this."" 

I breathe in his familiar scent—cologne mixed with coffee—and try to ignore how my heart races at his proximity. ""Maybe you could try dating someone new? Someone who actually appreciates you?"" 

Someone like me, I think but don't say. 

""I can't even think about that right now."" He sighs. ""No one compares to her."" 

The words sting, but I'm used to it. For a decade, I've been the best friend, the shoulder to cry on, the late-night phone call after another of Selena's dramatic breakups. I've held him through every reconciliation and subsequent heartbreak, each time hoping he might finally see me. 

I stand abruptly. ""Let's go out."" 

Liam looks up, confused. ""What?"" 

""Let's go out. Dancing. Drinking. Something that isn't sitting on this couch wallowing."" The words tumble from my mouth before I can stop them. I, Aurora Crestwood—self-proclaimed introvert who prefers sci-fi novels to nightclubs—am suggesting we go clubbing. 

""You hate clubs,"" he says, narrowing his eyes. 

""Yes, but you don't. And right now, you need a distraction."" 

He studies me for a moment, then a slow smile spreads across his face. ""You're serious?"" 

""Completely."" I'm already regretting this, but his smile—his genuine smile—makes it worth it. 

""Alright, hot nerd."" He stands up, suddenly energized. ""Let's see what you've got."" 

Hot nerd. His nickname for me since college. It should be flattering, but somehow it always reminds me of the line I can't seem to cross. 

Two hours later, I'm questioning all my life choices. The club is packed, the music is too loud, and I'm painfully aware of how out of place I look in my hastily chosen outfit—black jeans and a sparkly top I bought for my sister's birthday dinner last year. I tug self-consciously at my bob haircut with its signature bangs, wishing I'd at least taken time to style it properly. 

Liam, on the other hand, looks completely in his element. He's already downed two shots and is scanning the crowd like a hunter. 

""This was a great idea, Rory!"" he shouts over the music, squeezing my shoulder. ""I feel better already!"" 

I force a smile, regretting my impulsive suggestion. What was I thinking? That we'd share a magical dance and he'd suddenly realize I'm the one he's been looking for all along? 

""I'm going to get another drink!"" I yell back, needing a moment away from him. 

At the bar, I order a vodka soda, something to take the edge off my nerves. When I turn back around, my heart sinks. Liam is already on the dance floor with a tall, willowy blonde. Her arms are draped around his neck as they move together to the pulsing beat. 

I watch, paralyzed, as she whispers something in his ear that makes him laugh. Her hands slide down his chest. My drink suddenly tastes bitter. 

After twenty minutes of awkwardly hovering near the bar, I've had enough. I march onto the dance floor, navigating through sweaty bodies until I reach them. 

""Hey,"" I say, tapping Liam's shoulder. ""I think I'm going to head home."" 

He turns, face flushed from dancing and alcohol. ""Already? We just got here!"" 

""It's been two hours,"" I correct him. 

The blonde—who's even more gorgeous up close—looks me up and down with thinly veiled amusement. ""Who's this?"" she asks Liam. 

""This is Aurora,"" he says, his arm still around her waist. ""My best friend. Practically my big sister."" 

Sister. The word is a slap in the face. 

The blonde extends a manicured hand. ""I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you."" 

I shake her hand limply. ""You too."" 

""Aurora's not usually a club person,"" Liam explains to Chloe. ""She's more of a stay-at-home-with-a-book type. Total hot nerd."" 

""Hot nerd,"" Chloe repeats, examining me with renewed interest. Her eyes linger on my glasses, my sensible shoes. ""I can see that."" 

Something in her tone makes my skin crawl. It's not mean, exactly, but there's a patronizing edge to it. 

""Well, don't let me interrupt,"" I say stiffly. ""I'll get an Uber."" 

""No, no, stay!"" Liam grabs my wrist. ""We're having fun! Right, Chloe?"" 

""Absolutely."" Chloe's smile doesn't reach her eyes. ""The more the merrier."" 

Reluctantly, I stay, hovering at the edge of their dance bubble like an awkward satellite. Liam occasionally turns to include me, but his attention keeps drifting back to Chloe. I've never felt more invisible. 

After another excruciating half hour, Chloe pulls me into their conversation. ""So, Aurora, how long have you two known each other?"" 

""Ten years,"" I reply. ""We met in college."" 

""Ten years? Wow."" She looks between us with exaggerated surprise. ""And you've never...?"" 

""Never what?"" Liam asks, oblivious. 

Chloe laughs. ""Never mind."" She turns back to me. ""It must be hard, being the friend zone for so long."" 

My cheeks burn. ""It's not—we're not—"" 

""Oh, come on,"" she continues, her voice light but her eyes calculating. ""Seriously? You're not even a little tempted to see Aurora naked?"" 

The question hangs in the air between us, making my heart stop. Liam's expression freezes, and I can't breathe as I wait for his response. 



# Chapter 2: An Indecent Proposal

 

AURORA 

Liam's face contorts into an expression of shock and discomfort. ""What? No! That's not—she's like my sister!"" 

His words slice through me like a blade. Ten years of unrequited love condensed into a single moment of humiliation. 

Chloe smirks, watching me with knowing eyes. ""Really? You've never thought about it? Not even once?"" 

""Stop,"" I say, my voice smaller than I intend. 

""I mean, the whole hot nerd thing is a vibe."" Chloe continues, ignoring my protest. ""Those glasses, that innocent look. I bet she's wild underneath all that."" 

My cheeks burn with mortification. I take a step back, nearly colliding with another dancer. 

""Seriously, Chloe. That's weird."" Liam laughs nervously, but doesn't deny it further or defend me. His arm remains firmly around her waist. 

""I need to use the restroom,"" I mutter, turning away before either can see the tears threatening to spill. 

I push through the crowd, desperate to escape. The bathroom is mercifully empty. I lock myself in a stall, press my forehead against the cool metal door, and finally let the tears come. 

What a fool I've been. For ten years, I've been living in a fantasy, waiting for Liam to notice me. All while he's seen me as nothing more than a surrogate sister, a safe shoulder to cry on. 

After splashing cold water on my face, I stare at my reflection in the mirror. My mascara has smudged beneath my eyes, making me look even more pitiful. 

""Pull yourself together,"" I whisper to my reflection. ""You're better than this."" 

When I finally emerge from the bathroom twenty minutes later, Liam and Chloe are nowhere to be seen. I scan the dance floor, check the bar, even peek outside. My stomach drops when I spot them in the parking lot through the club's front windows – stumbling toward my car. 

I rush outside. ""What are you doing?"" 

Liam looks up, keys dangling from his fingers – my keys. ""There you are! We were looking for you!"" 

""No, you weren't,"" I snap, snatching the keys from his hand. ""And you're not driving my car. You're drunk."" 

""We're going to Chloe's place,"" he explains, swaying slightly. ""Thought we'd borrow your car. I was gonna text you."" 

""How thoughtful,"" I say, voice dripping with sarcasm. 

Chloe giggles, hanging off his arm. ""We can get an Uber if it's a problem."" 

I look at Liam – disheveled, clearly intoxicated, and completely oblivious to my feelings. The thought of him going home with this woman makes me sick, but the thought of them potentially getting into an accident is worse. 

""I'll drive you,"" I say stiffly. 

The car ride is excruciating. They start making out in my backseat almost immediately. Every wet sound, every giggle, every whispered word is torture. I grip the steering wheel until my knuckles turn white, focusing on the road to block them out. 

""Where am I going?"" I ask, voice tight. 

""Sunset Apartments on Maple,"" Chloe replies breathlessly. ""Building C."" 

Ten more minutes of this hell. I can endure it. 

""So, Aurora,"" Chloe calls from the backseat. ""How long have you been in love with Liam?"" 

The car swerves slightly as the question hits me like a physical blow. 

""What?"" I choke out. 

Liam pulls away from Chloe, confusion written across his face. ""What are you talking about?"" 

She laughs. ""Oh, come on. It's so obvious. The way she looks at you, how she dropped everything to be your emotional support animal tonight."" 

""Shut up,"" I hiss, hands shaking on the wheel. 

""Aurora's just a good friend,"" Liam says, oblivious to my distress. ""Right, Rory?"" 

I say nothing, heat crawling up my neck, into my face. 

""She's lying,"" Chloe sings. ""Look at her! She's blushing!"" 

""Chloe, stop,"" Liam says, but there's uncertainty in his voice now. ""That's not funny."" 

""What's not funny is watching her pine after you while you use her as a therapist."" Chloe's voice turns cruel. ""It's actually kind of pathetic."" 

""Pull over,"" I demand, voice shaking. 

""What?"" Liam asks. 

""Pull over!"" Chloe mocks in a high-pitched voice. ""She's having a meltdown because I exposed her little secret."" 

I slam on the brakes, pulling haphazardly to the curb. ""Get out. Both of you."" 

""Aurora, come on—"" Liam starts. 

""GET OUT OF MY CAR!"" I scream, shocking even myself with the volume. 

Chloe laughs, opening her door. ""Wow, the mouse has teeth."" 

""Aurora, you're overreacting,"" Liam says, his tone condescending. ""We're still like five blocks from Chloe's—"" 

""I don't care if you have to crawl there,"" I cut him off. ""Get out. Now."" 

Liam stares at me, finally registering my fury. ""Are you serious?"" 

""Deadly."" 

He climbs out slowly, looking bewildered. ""What's gotten into you?"" 

I don't answer. The moment his door closes, I speed away, tears blurring my vision. In my rearview mirror, I see them standing on the sidewalk, Liam's expression a mix of confusion and anger. 

For the next week, I ignore Liam's calls and texts. They start apologetic, then grow increasingly frustrated. 

""Aurora, please call me back. I don't understand what happened."" 

""Are you seriously ghosting me over a stupid joke?"" 

""This is childish, even for you."" 

On Friday morning, my phone buzzes with another message: ""Fine. If you won't talk to me, I'll come to you."" 

I'm in the middle of a cybersecurity brief when my assistant interrupts. 

""Ms. Crestwood, there's a man insisting on seeing you. He says it's urgent."" 

Before I can respond, Liam pushes past her into my office. He looks terrible – unshaven, with dark circles under his eyes. But there's determination in his stance. 

""You can't ignore me forever,"" he announces. 

I stand, mortified. ""This is my workplace. You can't just barge in here."" 

""You left me no choice!"" His voice rises, drawing attention from colleagues passing by. ""What happened last week? Why are you punishing me for something Chloe said?"" 

""Lower your voice,"" I hiss. ""And it wasn't just what she said. It was that you didn't defend me, didn't deny it—"" 

""Deny what? That you have feelings for me?"" He throws his hands up. ""I thought she was being ridiculous! Was I supposed to take it seriously?"" 

My silence is damning. 

The realization dawns on his face slowly, like the sun breaking through clouds. ""Aurora... do you have feelings for me?"" 

I close my eyes, wishing the floor would open and swallow me whole. ""It doesn't matter."" 

""It matters to me,"" he insists, stepping closer. 

""Please leave,"" I whisper. 

""Not until you talk to me."" He reaches for my hand, but I pull away. 

""There's nothing to talk about. You made your position clear a long time ago. I'm your 'sister,' remember?"" 

He winces. ""That's not fair. I didn't know—"" 

""You didn't want to know,"" I correct him. ""It was more convenient to keep me in that box."" 

He runs his hands through his hair, frustration evident. ""So what now? Ten years of friendship down the drain because your feelings are hurt?"" 

""My feelings aren't just hurt, Liam. They're shattered. And not just because of last week. Because of a decade of being invisible to you."" 

He stares at me, speechless for once. 

I sink back into my chair. ""Just go. Please."" 

Instead, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out an envelope, tossing it on my desk. ""I came here for another reason, actually."" 

I stare at the envelope suspiciously. ""What is this?"" 

""Open it."" 

With cautious fingers, I lift the flap. Inside are two plane tickets to Asheville, North Carolina, dated for next weekend. 

My heart drops. ""What is this?"" 

Liam's expression transforms into something determined, almost manic. The heartbroken man is gone, replaced by someone with a dangerous glint in his eye. 

""You and I,"" he announces with dramatic flourish, ""are crashing Selena's wedding."" 

Chapter 3: The Wrong Brother

 

AURORA 

""You're out of your mind,"" I say, staring at Liam in disbelief. 

The plane tickets to Asheville feel hot in my hands, like I'm holding something radioactive. Seven weeks have passed since Selena's digital wedding invitation showed up in Liam's inbox, and now he's standing in my office proposing this insanity. 

""Maybe I am,"" he admits, pacing in front of my desk. ""But I can't just sit back and watch her marry someone else without at least trying."" 

""Trying what?"" I drop the tickets. ""To humiliate yourself? To ruin her wedding? What exactly is your plan here?"" 

He stops pacing. His eyes have that wild look I've seen too many times—the Selena-induced madness that turns my level-headed friend into a stranger. 

""I need to talk to her one last time, make her see that we're meant to be together."" 

I press my fingers to my temples. ""Liam, she's marrying another man in three days."" 

""People change their minds all the time,"" he insists. ""Wedding day jitters are real."" 

""This is pathetic, even for you."" The words come out harsher than intended, but I'm beyond caring. Ten years of watching this toxic cycle has worn my patience thin. 

His expression shifts from determination to hurt. ""I need you with me, Aurora."" 

""Why? So I can pick up the pieces again when she rejects you? So I can be your emotional support animal like Chloe said?"" 

He winces at the reminder. ""That's not fair."" 

""None of this is fair,"" I say, gesturing between us. ""You barging into my workplace, ignoring my feelings, expecting me to drop everything for your self-destructive schemes."" 

Liam comes around my desk and kneels beside my chair. His eyes—those beautiful brown eyes I've loved for a decade—brim with desperation. 

""Please,"" he whispers, taking my hands in his. ""I need my best friend."" 

The worst part is, I know I'll say yes. I always do. No matter how many times I swear I'm done enabling his obsession with Selena, he knows exactly how to pull me back in. 

""I can't,"" I try weakly. 

""You can,"" he counters. ""We'll fly out Friday morning, attend the rehearsal dinner as my plus one, and I'll talk to her before the ceremony on Saturday. Then we'll fly back Sunday."" 

""You're not even invited!"" 

""I have connections at the venue. The assistant manager owes me a favor."" 

Of course he does. Liam's charm has always opened doors for him. 

""What if she calls security?"" 

""She won't,"" he says with maddening confidence. ""She'll want to hear what I have to say."" 

I pull my hands from his grasp. ""And what about us? What about what I told you?"" 

His expression clouds. ""Aurora... I care about you so much, but right now I need to focus on this. We can talk about us after."" 

After. Always after. After Selena. After his heartbreak. After his needs are met. 

""You're using me,"" I say flatly. 

""I'm asking for your support,"" he corrects. ""Like friends give each other."" 

The word ""friends"" stings worse than any insult. I stare at him—this man I've loved from afar for so long—and realize nothing has changed. He still sees what he wants to see. 

""Fine,"" I say, resignation washing over me. ""But this is the last time, Liam. I mean it."" 

His face breaks into a relieved smile. ""Thank you. I promise I'll make it up to you."" 

I doubt that, but I'm too tired to argue further. 

The week passes in a blur of preparation and anxiety. By Friday morning, I'm standing at the Asheville Regional Airport, dragging my suitcase through the arrivals area while checking my phone for the thousandth time. 

No messages from Liam. No calls. 

""Where are you?"" I mutter, dialing his number again. It rings endlessly before going to voicemail. 

This is so typical. He probably overslept or got caught up planning his grand gesture to Selena. Meanwhile, I'm stranded at an unfamiliar airport after sacrificing a day off work for his scheme. 

After thirty minutes of waiting, my patience evaporates. I send him a final text: 

\*I'm at the airport. If you don't show up or call in the next five minutes, I'm going back to Charlotte.\* 

No response. 

I'm about to book a return flight when a sleek black Ford Mustang pulls up to the curb. The windows are tinted so dark I can't see the driver. The car sits there, engine running, like something from a thriller movie. 

As I watch, the driver's window slides down to reveal a man with sharp features and dark, penetrating eyes. He's conventionally handsome in the way that makes warning bells sound—too perfect, too dangerous. 

""Aurora Crestwood?"" he calls, his voice deep and commanding. 

I take an instinctive step back. ""Who's asking?"" 

His lips curl into something between a smile and a sneer. ""Your chauffeur, apparently."" 

""I didn't order a car."" 

""No, you didn't,"" he agrees, amusement flickering in his eyes. ""But my brother did."" 

Brother? I stare at him, confusion turning to dawning realization. Liam has mentioned having a brother only a handful of times, and never in detail. 

""Where's Liam?"" I demand. 

""Running late. Or running away. Hard to know with him."" He leans across the passenger seat to push open the door. ""Get in. Unless you prefer standing in the heat."" 

Every instinct tells me to walk away. This man radiates danger. But I'm tired, frustrated, and stuck in a city where I know no one. Against my better judgment, I move toward the car. 

""How do I know Liam actually sent you?"" 

He sighs dramatically. ""You're Aurora Crestwood, cybersecurity analyst, best friend to my emotionally constipated brother for the past decade. You're here to help him crash his ex-girlfriend's wedding because you're pathetically in love with him and can't say no when he bats those puppy eyes at you."" His gaze sweeps over me, assessing. ""Did I miss anything?"" 

My face burns with humiliation and anger. ""Who the hell are you?"" 

""Kian Vance,"" he says, watching my reaction carefully. ""I guess you can call me the wrong brother."" 

His words hang between us, charged with meaning I don't fully understand. Something about him makes my skin prickle—not entirely with fear, but with a visceral awareness I've never felt around Liam. 

The wrong brother. What does that even mean? 

I hesitate, one hand on my suitcase, the other on the car door. Walking away would be the sensible choice. But curiosity—and the lack of alternatives—pulls me forward. 

As I slide into the passenger seat, the leather cold against my bare legs, I can't shake the feeling that I'm stepping into something I won't be able to easily escape. 

""Where's Liam really?"" I ask as Kian pulls away from the curb. 

His fingers tighten on the steering wheel. ""Getting his shit together, hopefully."" 

""That's not an answer."" 

""It's the only one you're getting for now."" 

I clutch my purse tighter, suddenly aware of how vulnerable I am—in a stranger's car, in an unfamiliar city, with no real plan. 

""If Liam didn't send you, then why are you here?"" 

Kian's eyes remain fixed on the road, but a smile plays at the corners of his mouth. ""Let's just say I have a vested interest in my brother's romantic disasters."" 

His words chill me. Whatever game is being played, I've somehow become a pawn in it. 

""Take me to the hotel,"" I say firmly. ""I'll wait for Liam there."" 

""As you wish."" Kian accelerates, the powerful engine purring beneath us. ""But don't hold your breath waiting for him to show up. Liam has a habit of disappointing the people who care about him."" 

I stare out the window as Asheville's streets blur past, wondering what I've gotten myself into—and why, despite everything, I feel an unsettling pull toward the dangerous man beside me. 

The wrong brother, indeed. ",1,1751544287.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Because of the speed we had to relocate her, I was still living in a studio apartment when she got here and it was that way for almost 3 months. About 2 months in we got a dog who shared a bed with us (I had a king, wasn’t going to put my sis on the floor or old sofa). Because of my sisters history, she moved very quietly and I woke up to the dog freaking out because my sister wasn’t in bed. I looked and saw her in the kitchen and she said she was finishing up making coffee, so I turned to the dog to say it’s okay? She’s almost done. At that time, I see my sister quietly walk by the foot if the bed, like she’s coming back to bed and tell the pup, see, she’s coming back. When I said that, from the kitchen I hear “I am?” I was instantly scared; it was absolutely my sister I saw. Told her and she was freaked out. 
Cut to our new apartment and we were settling in and I’m in the hall by our bedrooms playing with the dog, and see her head pop out of her doorway. I told the dog “there’s your mom” and then here my sister say “huh”. I turn and look and my sister is under the covers, buried in a book. She was never in the door frame. 
That was about 2 months ago and while we’ve had the random noises and shadows, I’ve not seen my sister’s lookalike shadow. What could it potentially be, should we be worried, and if it’s not been seen since then, could ir be gone?",2,1751544272.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

1lqntc3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqntc3,"Did I just make heaven? 14 kcal a piece cloud cinnamon rolls (dairy free, sugar free and high protein)🤤","Recipe is very simple 
-230 grams of egg white (leave them to heat to room temp, trust me)
-powdered icing sugaresque sweetener 
-cinnamon 
-some sort of brown syrup 
-cinnamon coffee syrup 
-tapioca starch (any starch works but after playing around with egg white and starches I think tapioca is my favourite)

Preheat oven to 150°c (Americans you gotta do the math cos Fahrenheit is nonsense) and line an oven tray with baking paper

Whisk the eggs up to stiff peaks and then throw in the table spoon of starch, I also went rogue and threw in some powdered fake sugar at this stage (maybe two tablespoons). Whisk again until it’s all incorporated and stiff 

Spoon onto tray and make a big / even rectangle and shove into the oven for 20-25mins. I was silly and opened the oven halfway through as I needed a tray from there and it deflated my eggs a bit so learn from my mistake. 

Whilst that’s cooking - mix up the cinnamon syrup, maybe a couple spoons of powdered fake sugar, cinnamon (measure with the heart) and your syrup. Taste test and if it’s good then wait for the eggs to come out oven. 

Spread the icing onto the whole rectangle and then start rolling it up. I didn’t wait for anything to cool and it was fine tbh. 

Voila!

You can def use any flavouring for the inside and if you want to make a proper glaze for the top you can use yoghurt and sweetener I guess!

1lqnrh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/problems/comments/1lqnrh1/my_friend_faked_his_cancer_and_lied_to_me_and_my/,My friend faked his cancer and lied to me and my near ones… and now he’s threatening me to kill me just because I showed everyone the truth,"It all started during university physical enrollment day. I met this dude cool, stylish, just good vibes. I asked him, “Yo bro, where did you get those baggy jeans?” He goes, “Bershka and Pull&Bear.” I laughed and said, “Oh I know, right? Their monthly drops suck.” Boom. Instant connection. We talked outfits, sneakers, skateboards the whole starter pack.

We got called to pick up our student cards, and as I was leaving, I told him, “Yo, I just bought a skateboard. We should hang sometime.” He nodded and gave me his socials.

The next day, we linked up at uni and chilled at our favorite spot the library. It was calm, quiet, Wi-Fi was meh but usable. We’d skate after class, share food, talk about life, even formed the best friend group I’ve ever had.

Then it all changed.

One day while skating, we took a break, and outta nowhere he goes: “Ey Abdou, I think I have lung cancer.” I froze. I said, “No way dude, you’ll get over it.” He replied, “I did some tests… but I don’t know yet.” I told him to stay strong, not overthink. Deep down, something felt off. But I brushed it off.

Weeks passed. We both joined a university club a place to learn and build ourselves. That’s when his behavior started shifting.

One day, outside the club, a friend told me he was faking his illness. I defended him hard. “Nah bro, he said the results aren’t out yet.” Then, Ramadan hit.

The second week of Ramadan the bomb dropped. He showed us fake medical results saying he had stage 3 lung cancer. Everyone in the club was shocked. Even me.

I offered to bring him medicine. He replied, “With pleasure.” Bro… biggest red flag, but again, I brushed it off.

Later that night, we went to a coffee shop. I told him about a weird group chat I was in. He snatched my phone, added himself, saw a girl in the group, slid in her DMs, dated her for 3 weeks, and left. Just like that. He played everyone with lies and manipulation.

When the girl broke up with him, I got kicked from the group chat… just for defending him.

It gets worse.

Our club organized a UI/UX course. He didn’t show up for two sessions. At the third one, he said he missed it because of chemotherapy. The vice president called him out. He knew he was lying from the beginning but let it slide with a warning.

I brought him expensive medicine through someone who worked with my dad. I couldn’t afford it myself. But I still gave it to him.

During exam season, he met another girl. Sweet, kind didn’t deserve what happened next.

He started feeding her lies. – That we abused him – That his parents bullied him – That he drove a Maybach – And that he had stage 3 cancer

She felt so bad for him, she gave him 6,000 DZD because he told her he stole 10,000 DZD from his dad and needed help to pay it back.

She later did some digging and realized he was full of it. She made him give the money back.

Meanwhile, I did my own investigations. Turns out, every single story was fake. His ex confirmed he pulled the same cancer lie on her. Another girl told me he manipulated her too.

And then came the final straw.

I was chatting with a girl I met online. Told her my day was rough because a “friend” faked cancer. She replied: “Ayo… are you talking about Mohammed?” I said yes.

She spilled it all. – He repeatedly asked her out – She refused – He made her uncomfortable after she sent a harmless snap – And worst of all, he asked her a sick question about whether she was ever raped as a kid

That’s when I lost all sympathy. He heard I was exposing him. He started threatening me. Said he’d “end me.”

What he doesn’t know is: if he ever approaches me again… I won’t hesitate to defend myself. Dude’s dead to me. He crossed all lines.

He lied, manipulated, scammed kind people, faked illness, emotionally abused women all for clout, attention, and pity.

I don’t even want revenge for myself. I want it for every person he hurt, lied to, or used.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1lqnp0q,https://i.redd.it/vvm00jh4fnaf1.jpeg,Review: Wonder Rose EDT & Gardenia EDP by Zara,"I was gifted 30ml bottles of Zara Wonder Rose EDT and Zara Gardenia EDP recently and I’m starting to wonder if Zara’s fragrance naming system is a long-term prank. The names make absolutely no sense!

**Wonder Rose** smells like a fruity, sweet shampoo. There’s absolutely no rose in this — at least not to my nose. It opens with a noticeable pear note, a quick burst of fruitiness that settles into a slightly sugary, fruity blend. There’s a bit of vanilla here too — not the rich, creamy, gourmand kind but more of a soft background note that smooths out the sweetness. This fragrance lasts about 2-3 hours on me, with moderate projection and sillage in the first hour or so.

**Gardenia** is also hilariously misnamed. There’s no gardenia in this at all. It’s a full-on floral gourmand, like a lighter, more wearable version of YSL Black Opium EDP. There’s supposedly a coffee note and if you really concentrate, you might catch a faint whisper of it. This fragrance lasts about 4-5 hours on me and isn’t overly heavy, which I actually appreciate. Projects well for the first couple of hours. 

Both fragrances make great gifts thanks to their simple, approachable scent profiles. They are easy-reaches and nice for layering. These 30ml bottles are cute, minimal and very travel-friendly.

Just keep this in mind: both fragrances are sweet and youthful. They’re crowd-pleasing from afar but can become a bit much if oversprayed. I do a maximum of 3-4 sprays per wear but this is the case with most fragrances for me. YMMV. 

Have you tried these or any other Zara fragrances? Would love to hear your thoughts!",2,1751543847.0,desifemfrag,2,1.0,False
1lqnoxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1lqnoxp/completed_first_dirty_fast_any_advice_going/,Completed first “dirty” fast! Any advice going forward?,"==Skip to 2nd last paragraph for my ADF result==

Hi guys, I’m a 22yr old 5ft5 male, and was overweight and obese my whole life up until last year. Before ADF and intuitively eating, I binged in June for a long 6 days straight due to constantly being overly aware and too restricting with my calories since October 2023. I also binged around once or twice a month since April this year and kept exceeding my calorie target which was making me feel low.
I have lost almost 100lbs in the past 14 months and the whole time I’ve religiously tracked my calories, done lots of cardio, and prioritised only protein. There was no sense of freedom unless I had a “f*** it” mentality, overate, or binged. It has been very rocky. I was varying my calories from 1300-1500 Cals throughout the months but I had planned all of those days. I’m sure prioritising protein played a lot into why I was bingeing as well. I decided it was time to change this and close that whole chapter.

I researched intuitive eating and decided I will use the knowledge I have of food and nutrition, and utilise it to intuitively eat nutrient dense, minimal processed foods. Watching Hailey Fernandes and her journey really helped. I always had in my mind “I can’t wait to end this calorie deficit so I can eat all of the healthy foods I want because they’re so high in calorie I can’t fit them in” (awful mindset!) From experience, those are the foods which help me feel my best, keep hunger stable, and keep me motivated and full & satisfied for longer. The first day I started doing this, my binge fully stopped, food noise went on mute, and my whole mood lifted and I felt insanely free and amazing. I have been journaling since this day and it has helped so much, just writing down my thoughts and feelings. Knowing I can eat whenever I want, whatever I want, was so freeing and I think that’s what I had craved this whole time, the freedom. This was also why I binged because I didn’t have that restriction, but the freedom was also paired with constant tiredness and sadness. I haven’t counted calories since and have just been listening to my bodies queues. This has developed my patience between meals, knowing I can have it anytime without the restriction. After the first few days I had so much weight taken off of my shoulders, and I felt so motivated. I’ve started my morning walks again, as I know this helps my mental well being and sets me up for a positive day ahead. I also stopped consuming fizzy drinks, specifically zero calorie as this is all I’d drink alongside water, and stopped chewing gum. My weight on the scales has been gradually coming down and I’ve been weighing myself less to take off any pressure.

I then found out about 36 hour ADF. I had done water fasts back in 2020 with the completely wrong mindset and it damaged my relationship with food. I was scared of fasting since then because I related it to that experience. Since getting into a better, healthier, and motivated head space, I decided to do further research. I watched several videos from Dr Jason Fung and read articles about it. I decided to do it. I started fasting Tuesday night and ended up completing this “dirty fast”. I drank whole milk in my coffee and tea and had an apple during this fast, taking in an overall intake of around 300-400 cals. It was surprisingly easily, especially after learning about it on a deeper level, and all about grehlin and insulin. This made it easier when my stomach would gurgle, I knew it’d pass and stop then I wouldn’t feel hunger, in which it did. I broke my fast this morning with a sourdough roll, 2 eggs, avocado and some red pesto. I also made a skyr bowl with a date, honey, half a banana, and almond butter. I drank a coffee alongside this with whole milk. I felt full quicker and couldn’t finish the other half of my roll with the 2nd egg. My body also didn’t have that urge to eat it anyway despite feeling full. This is a bad habit I’ve always had, as if my body to thinks I won’t be able to eat that food again. I still feel full hours later and haven’t thought about my next meal or any food except now as I’m typing this. I really want to do more research on this because it is mind blowing how the mind and body can change so quickly, especially signals. 

Id really appreciate if anyone could recommend their favourite books, videos etc, where I can research more into the science behind this. It’s incredibly fascinating and has surprisingly been straight forward so far. I’m sure there’s the chance of rocky days ahead but if I build on this mindset, I can definitely work through it, especially after proving to myself that I can get out of a distressing bingeing state. That took A LOT of willpower.",1,1751543840.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,1.0,False
1lqnono,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lqnono/eureka_atom_75_seems_slept_on_its_simply/,Eureka Atom 75 seems slept on. It’s simply incredible.,"I’ve had my Atom 75 for a few years now and it’s served incredibly well. I’ve had several other grinders before and during its tenure. I’ve been doing home espresso for about two decades and I’ve rotated a lot of gear in that time. I see tons of recommendations for 64mm burr machines in exactly the same price range as the atom. 

Recently I picked up a Monolith Flat Max 3. It’s a completely different beast and I love it, but it’s given me an even greater appreciation for the Atom. 

The atom has a wider grind distribution making it very easy to dial in and stay dialed in. Its grind setting is incredibly responsive without being cumbersome. The grind quality is absolutely excellent and consistent. I’ve used it without making changes to the grind setting across several bags of coffee and when I do need to dial in it’s almost always a small adjustment. I exclusively drink light roasts so this is no easy task.

I upgraded hoping for workflow improvements as it’s just an “ok” single dose grinder. But having owned a niche zero and now the kafatek I would also say they are just “ok” and just different workflows not really better. I consistently get .1-.2g retention with the puffer lid. 

It’s also very quiet. 

I’ve had several 64mm burr grinders and they always seemed like a weird compromise to me. Yes there are some excellent burr designs out there (ssp making some great stuff) but nothing that strikes the balance of the burrs in the 75.

I know there’s a new GBW version and that’s great and all but the regular version has served me well with zero issues across some really finicky coffees. For the price I’m not sure there’s anything better for espresso. You’d need to pay significantly more to make improvements and even then it’s incremental at best.",8,1751543815.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best Yeti cup holders in 2025 offer a blend of innovative design and robust construction.

**Adjustable Base Diameter**

A critical feature in several models is an adjustable base diameter. This allows the cup holder to fit securely into a wide range of vehicle cup holder sizes. Most adjustable bases utilize a twist-and-expand mechanism, providing a snug fit regardless of the vehicle. This ensures minimal wobbling and reduces the risk of spills, especially during sharp turns or sudden stops. Some models also include rubberized grips within the base to further enhance stability and prevent slippage.

**Secure Locking Mechanism**

Many premium Yeti cup holders feature a locking mechanism that firmly secures the Yeti tumbler in place. This mechanism frequently enough involves a spring-loaded arm or a clamp that紧紧 grips the tumbler's exterior. The rigidity of these mechanisms ensures that the tumbler remains stable even on bumpy terrain or during off-road adventures. High-quality materials, such as stainless steel or reinforced nylon, are typically used to ensure the longevity of the locking mechanism.

**Durable Construction Materials**

The materials used in the construction of a Yeti cup holder considerably impact its durability and overall lifespan. The most common materials include high-impact ABS plastic, stainless steel, and aluminum. ABS plastic offers a balance of strength and affordability while being resistant to UV damage. Stainless steel and aluminum, on the other hand, provide superior durability and corrosion resistance, making them ideal for outdoor use in harsh conditions.

**Global Compatibility**

The ability to accommodate various sizes and types of Yeti products is a key benefit. Universal cup holders are designed with adjustable features that allow them to hold anything from small 12-ounce tumblers to larger 36-ounce bottles.Flexible silicone inserts or adjustable arms are frequently enough incorporated to ensure a snug fit for different Yeti models. This versatility eliminates the need for multiple cup holders, simplifying the overall user experience.

**Integrated Drainage System**

Some of the more advanced cup holders incorporate an integrated drainage system to handle condensation or spills. This feature is particularly useful in hot climates or when using the Yeti for cold beverages. The drainage system typically consists of small holes or channels that direct liquid away from the tumbler and out of the cup holder. This helps to prevent messes and keeps the cup holder clean and hygienic.**Rotating Design**

Certain cup holders come with a rotating base,allowing the user to easily access the Yeti from different angles. this feature is particularly useful for passengers in the back seat or for those who need to access their beverage while driving. The rotating mechanism is usually designed with smooth bearings to ensure effortless movement. A locking mechanism is often included to prevent unwanted rotation during transport.

## core Benefits

Yeti cup holders offer numerous advantages that enhance the user experience.

By ensuring that your Yeti tumbler is securely held in place, you won't have to worry about spills or reaching for a rolling bottle. This increased focus on the road contributes to safer driving conditions.**Extended Beverage Temperature:** While the Yeti tumbler itself excels at maintaining beverage temperature, a good cup holder helps further insulate the tumbler from external temperature fluctuations.

**This book just gave me the most MORTIFYING secondhand embarrassment and I can't stop reading 😭🔥**

**""After One Night with My President""**

Listen, I thought I was ready for some office romance but this book said ""let me emotionally destroy you with awkward situations"" and delivered the most cringe-worthy yet addictive story ever!

**The premise:** Adeline has to buy condoms for her boss Harrison, delivers them to his hotel room, and ends up sleeping with him after he was drugged. The next day? He asks HER to investigate who the mystery woman in his bed was. Girl is literally investigating HERSELF while dying inside! The secondhand embarrassment is REAL! 💀

**Why I'm completely UNHINGED:**

* The ""enhanced endurance"" condom detail - I CANNOT with this author's specificity
* Adeline having to investigate her own one-night stand while Harrison calls the mystery woman ""not worth investigating"" - THE IRONY
* Her spilling coffee on his pants in the EXACT wrong spot - the timing is diabolical
* 494 chapters with 4.6 rating of pure awkward perfection
* Harrison being completely clueless while she's dying of mortification
* The way she's both relieved and insulted when he dismisses investigating ""that kind of woman""

**What's sending me into ORBIT:**

* Adeline buying condoms as a work errand like it's printer paper
* Him asking ""what are you nervous about?"" while she's literally hiding their night together
* The missing assistant Kyson who clearly set this whole thing up
* Harrison blacklisting an entire company over the setup while being oblivious to the real situation
* Her having to professionally investigate her own shame

**Fair warning:** This is 494 chapters of pure workplace awkwardness, secret identity chaos, and slow-burn romance with a side of corporate drama.

Aurora Rose really said ""let me write the most mortifying office romance ever"" and I'm here for every cringe-worthy moment. The setup is PERFECT for maximum awkwardness!

**Rating: 5/5 stars** for emotional torture ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Anyone else reading this? I NEED to know how long Adeline can keep this secret and when Harrison figures out the truth. Also drop your best ""hiding in plain sight"" romance recs! 😤

*****


&nbsp;


The light had no source, but it was everywhere. It hung in the air like static, dancing across the scorched concrete of the Rogue’s basement. The walls trembled with unseen pressure. Barry stood still. His fingers twitched. His eyes flicked toward every flicker of motion, though there were none. His heart pounded against his ribs like it was trying to escape.

And inside his head… screaming.

Not voices, not words. Just the pressure of motion - his own, the world's, the universe’s - suddenly unmoored. He could feel time like a current, and it wasn’t flowing right. It was surging around him, through him.

He closed his eyes, sucked in a sharp breath, and tried to centre himself.

“You’re feeling it, aren’t you?” came the voice behind him, calm, almost amused. “The threshold of omnipresence. All of it. All at once.”

Barry’s eyes snapped open. Reverse Flash hadn’t moved, unbothered, his yellow suit glowing faintly in the Speed Force-charged gloam.

“Breathe, Barry,” the Reverse Flash said softly. “Come on. In. Out. There’s power in your lungs now. Feel it. Let it remind you that you’re still tethered here. Or *now*.”

Barry’s fingers flexed at his sides, but he obeyed. *Inhale. Hold. Exhale.* It felt like he was breathing fire.

“What is this?” he managed, his voice raw.

The Reverse Flash shrugged. “Your third eye’s opening. The EMP didn’t just flood the Speed Force. It broke the dam. Every cell in your body is humming in a new frequency now. You’re stretched thin across a thousand moments. One thought too deep, and you might fall into another century. So breathe.”

Barry shook his head. “It’s like I could touch every moment that’s ever happened.”

“But you shouldn’t,” Reverse Flash warned. “That’s how you lose the now.”

He tried to hold onto the present, to stay here, in this trembling ruin of a basement, with the hum of disaster still crawling through the walls. But the pull was everywhere, like gravity in every direction.

Then he felt it.

A tug, deep and low in his gut. Not pain. Not fear. A resonance. He clutched the wall. Another Speed Force signature. Not just one. Dozens. Reaching for him like echoes through spacetime. It gave him chills.

“What is that?” he whispered.

“Others,” replied the Reverse Flash. “Speedsters.”

Barry’s voice was low. “Time’s frozen, isn’t it.”

The Reverse Flash just smiled. “To everyone but speedsters like us.”

Barry turned, his jaw tight. “The whole world?”

A shrug. “City-wide? Planet-wide? Check if you like, I’m not in a rush.”

Barry didn’t answer. He didn’t want to leave. If he left and this was some kind of time bubble, he might never get back inside. And then it surged again. Agony, not his. Distant, then close. Barry gasped, one hand clutching his chest.

“You might want to go and check that out,” the other man said, far too casual.

Barry turned sharply. “The EMP explosion was Positive Speed Force energy. I’m willing to bet it hasn’t affected you nearly as much as it’s affected me.”

He didn’t deny it.

“You don’t seem very afraid of what that means,” Barry growled, stepping closer. His knuckles cracked as lightning flickered along his arm.

The Reverse Flash met his glare. “You don’t want to hurt me, Barry. You want to save the day.” A beat. “And something tells me you’ll want to start at home.”

Barry froze. *Oh god*. Patty.

The next moment he was gone.

The city had changed. The sky was a blood-red bruise. Black clouds rolled like ash across it. Lightning cut across the sky in greens, blues, purples. No wind followed him; everything was too still. The world was a diorama, paused in its turmoil.

People stood mid-stride, mouths open, hands raised. A woman cradled a coffee cup that floated, perfectly still, mid-spill. A child was frozen mid-fall, his balloon locked in the air behind him.

Barry tried not to panic. But as the house came into view, every step felt heavier.

No movement. No sound. No wind.

And then—

“Barry!”

It tore through the silence, ragged and pained. He burst through the front door.

Patty was on the floor, her back hunched, her body shaking with arcs of jagged blue lightning. Not frozen. Very much not frozen. Her hands clutched the carpet. Her skin was pale and clammy.

Beside her, Iris was suspended in mid-motion, her face frozen in alarm, one hand stretched toward Patty’s shoulder.

Barry fell to his knees beside her. “Patty? Oh my god, wh-what happened? Are you okay?”

She grimaced, her eyes wide and panicked. “What’s happening to me?” she gasped. “Everything’s wrong. I-I can’t think, I can’t… Why’s Iris not moving?!”

His brain raced. The Negative Speed Force. That had to be it. She was still connected, and the Positive Speed Force explosion must have been interfering with her. But the Reverse Flash had barely twitched. Was it different for her?

He cupped her cheek. “Patty, I think this is fallout from the explosion. You’re still connected to—”

“Barry!” she shouted, cutting him off. Her hand shot forward, gripping his wrist with desperate strength. “I’m not dying! I’m not hurt! I’m—”

And then she howled. Loud. Fierce.

“I’m in labour, you idiot!”

His mouth opened.

Closed.

“Oh.”

And then: dread.

His face went pale. “Oh no.”

Patty clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with something between terror and furious disbelief. “You’re going to have to deliver this baby.”

The house crackled with lightning. Outside, the sky cracked and boiled.

Barry Allen swallowed hard.


&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;


William groaned as he blinked through the blur of dust and pain. His ribs ached where Barry had thrown him. He was no stranger to pain, but this felt different. It wasn't just his body that hurt. There was a pit in his gut, cold and wide, and it had nothing to do with broken bones.

He shoved debris off his chest and sat up. The New Rogues’ hideout was in ruins, the floor split and buckled, the walls scorched with lightning residue.

“Zack?” he called. No response. His voice cracked. “Grace? Hunt?”

They were all there, sprawled in different corners, limbs twisted awkwardly like discarded marionettes. But alive. Frozen. Still as statues.

He knelt beside Zack first, brushing dust from the kid’s cheek. No injuries beyond bruises. Donald had a dislocated shoulder. Grace looked worse off, her jaw slack and blood dried at her temple. But none of them were seriously injured.

William rose to his feet slowly, his every muscle disagreeing with the decision. His thoughts swirled like a vortex. He’d known exactly what the Speed Force EMP was. He wasn’t proud of it, but he’d helped steal it. Helped charge it. It was a contingency, that was all. Something to use if the Reverse Flash ever returned. Not to turn on Barry. Not unless…

But he had agreed. He’d sat in on that meeting, heard Grace spell it out. If the Flash went too far, they’d use it on him too.

Now it seemed the world had stopped turning. The apocalypse had come to Central City.

William clenched his fists. He’d believed in Barry. Believed in him enough to think they’d never need that weapon. That Barry would never push them that far.

So why the hell had Barry kept charging it so far past its capacity?

A crack of Speed Force thunder rolled out, then suddenly Wally stood across from William, bathed in pale white lightning, eyes wide with urgency.

“Wally?” William’s voice faltered. The sight of him - healthy, alive - was like long withheld oxygen. So much so, William barely took note of the crimson and scarlet suit Wally now stood in. “What… what are you doing here?”

“Looking for Reverse Flash,” Wally said. “Where is he?”

William blinked. “He’s not here. All of this…” He looked around the bombsite of a headquarters, at his injured comrades. “This wasn’t him.”

Wally’s face darkened. “Reverse Flash was here. I saw him myself, when I snuck in to check out the stolen weapon. He was with the EMP, and he attacked me.”

William’s heart sank. “Barry thought it was us.”

“That’s what the Reverse Flash would have wanted,” Wally replied. “He framed Captain Cold for what he did to me.” A pause. “Like he framed Barry for Zolomon.”

The colour drained from William’s face. He staggered, doubled over, as the full weight of it hit him.

“We walked right into it,” he whispered. “He played us all.”

He couldn’t breathe. All this time, he’d been trying to keep his people safe, to finally get ahead of the Reverse Flash and exact his revenge. And he’d made everything worse.

“We thought we could stop him,” William muttered. “The plan was simple: EMP hits him, fries his powers. That was the whole idea. I never imagined—”

“Crisis,” Wally said quietly.

William stared at him.

“That’s what this is,” Wally said. “Not just some surge. It’s a full-blown Speed Force crisis. Maybe the big one.”

William ran a hand across the surface of his hair, wicking his sweat as he did. “Then I might’ve just killed Barry.”

“No,” Wally said. “The EMP -  if it went off with just the charge you gave it, it probably would’ve worked exactly like you said. But when I used my speed near it, it fed more power in. I’m willing to bet Reverse Flash must’ve tricked Barry. He probably goaded him into overcharging it.”

William’s jaw tightened. “So you’re saying it’s Barry’s fault?”

“He didn’t do it alone,” Wally added gently. “We all played a part.”

Both young men took a deep breath, grappling with the impossible situation that lay in their immediate future.

“Remember what Bart said?” Wally continued. “He said we can’t stop the crisis. But we can do what we can to struggle through it. Hopefully come out the other side okay.”

William let that sit.

He looked at Zack again, lying still. His team were all collateral in someone else’s game. His stomach turned.

“So what do we do?” he asked.

Wally’s voice sharpened. “We find Barry. He’s not in custody; I already checked his cell at Tinderland.”

William nodded. “Well, I know where I’d go after getting out of prison, if I were him.”

They locked eyes, no longer a hero and a rogue, but two men in the eye of the storm.

Wally said nothing more. He just ran. And William followed.


&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;


Wally and William raced across Central City. The air shimmered with red lightning. Shadows danced like ghosts across the cracked pavement. Skyscrapers flickered between motionless and distorted, time glitching at the edges of their foundations. 

*“108 kilohertz,”* Wally whispered. *“108 kilohertz. 108 kilohertz…”*

They hit Barry’s street with no time to waste. The world could end any second.

But when they reached the door, when they stepped into the house—

The apocalypse vanished.

Patty lay curled on the oversized chair, pale and weary but safe, blanketed in layers of plush fabric. She swaddled a tiny bundle in her arms. A baby boy. His hair was pale gold, tufts already unruly. Barry stood nearby, frazzled, trying to clean a towel with super-speed. Iris hovered protectively at Patty’s side, brushing her hair out of her face and murmuring something warm and quiet.

For a beat, neither Wally nor William could speak. Their chests heaved with adrenaline, but their brains couldn’t reconcile what they were seeing. The stillness. The beauty of new life against the awful destruction just outside the door.

William was the first to move. “Oh, my God,” he breathed. “You… Barry, she… Congratulations.” He walked toward Patty, eyes wide, reverent. “Is he… Can I say hello?”

Barry nodded. He didn’t trust himself to speak. The look William gave him - gracious, awed, unburdened - it burned.

William crouched beside the chair. “Hey, little guy,” he said softly. “You’ve got impeccable timing. Hope you didn’t take after your dad on that front.”

Patty smiled weakly. “He’s a tough act to follow.”

Meanwhile, Iris had crossed the room and thrown her arms around Wally. “You’re okay. Thank God.” She held him too tight. “We didn’t know when you’d wake up after what happened.”

Wally closed his eyes and returned the hug. “I’m here. I’m good.”

Barry hovered just behind, one hand gently finding Wally’s back. He had no words, not yet.

Wally looked over at Iris, then squinted. “Wait. You’re moving?”

Barry answered. “She was stuck. Like the rest of them. But when I went to sit her down, there was this… spark that moved between us. Like I transferred some speed to her, and I guess I pulled her into Flashtime.”

Wally nodded. “Makes sense. Speed sharing. Picked up that trick in the future, actually.”

The joy of the moment deflated slowly, gently. A mutual breath was held. A clock they couldn’t hear was ticking.

William met Barry’s eyes.

There was no hate in him. No anger. Just ache.

Barry looked away.

“What’s going on?” Patty asked. Her voice was soft, but steady. The baby shifted against her chest.

Wally exhaled, turning. “The Reverse Flash set this up. All of it. The weapon, the detonation. It’s an overcharged Speed Force EMP. Way beyond what any of us expected. And now we’re stuck in the glow of it. Flashtime: a single second, stretched out like taffy. That’s all we’ve got.”

Barry stepped forward. “When that second ends… the explosion continues. Our powers will cut out, and the Speed Force energy will be too much. It’ll take out both cities.”

“Not just that,” Wally added. “We don’t know what the blast will do to the Speed Force itself. It could collapse. Or fracture. Or…”

“...or end,” Barry finished.

Iris stared. “But the people. Everyone…”

Barry’s face hardened. “Gone. Unless we stop it.”

William straightened. “You sound like you have a plan.”

“I do,” Barry said. “It’s happened before. Twice, in fact.”

Patty froze. Her grip on Barry’s wrist tightened. “No. You’re not going into the Speed Force.”

Barry didn’t look at her. “There’s no other way. There wasn’t for my dad. There wasn’t for Bart.”

“Bart?” William frowned.

“Bart from the future. Or further in the future, I guess,” Barry explained. “Back when the Reverse Flash caused the Speed Force Storm. The one that gave you, me, and Patty our powers. Bart was the blue Flash that came through time to stop it. But he was ancient. Looked twenty, but he was pushing ninety. The only way he could stop it was by sacrificing himself to the Speed Force. Just like my dad.”

Barry glanced around the room. At Iris. At Patty. At the baby.

“I’ll head to STAR Labs, where the veil’s thinnest. The particle accelerator. I can open a portal there.”

His voice cracked.

“Then I’ll give myself to it.”

“No,” Wally said immediately. “There has to be another way.”

Barry turned to him. “You’ve seen the future, Wally. Is there?”

Wally bit down hard on his tongue. “108 kilohertz,” he muttered. But the number meant nothing. No revelation. No salvation. “I don’t know. Most of this decade is redacted from historical records, at least as far as the Flash is concerned. I’m flying blind.”

William stepped forward. “Don’t let the Reverse Flash win, Barry.”

Patty held his hand. “We only just found our way back to each other.”

Barry could barely meet her gaze.

He turned to Iris. “You’ve been quiet.”

She nodded, her voice low. “I remember how much it hurt you to lose your dad. How lost you were. You used to have nightmares. You think your son deserves that? Deserves to wonder why his father chose to disappear, whether it was because he wasn’t a good enough son, like you did?”

Tears streamed freely. Barry couldn’t try to hide them if he wanted to.

“My dad made the right decision,” he whispered. “He knew what had to be done, and I understood that. With time.”

*“Will he?”*

The voice stopped everything. Cold and venomous.

Barry, Wally, and William exploded into motion.

Iris grabbed Patty. Wally yanked them both back behind him, shielding the baby. William’s lightning flared hot as he moved to flank. In a blink, Barry had Reverse Flash by the throat, slammed against the wall.

The baby wailed. The cries cut through everything.

Barry’s voice was gravel. “What the hell do you want!?”

“For you to listen to your family, Barry,” Reverse Flash gurgled, struggling against Barry’s grip. “Well, some of them more than others.”

Barry’s fingers tightened. “What are you talking about?”

“You know,” Reverse Flash rasped, his lip curling. “I think you understood ol’ Jay’s sacrifice a little too well.”

Barry’s brows pulled together. Slowly, his hand loosened. The glow from the Speed Force EMP still flooded the air, pulsing in his bones. Whatever Reverse Flash was now, he wasn’t a physical threat. Not in this moment; not with Barry so supercharged.

Reverse Flash rolled his neck and straightened his shoulders. “I’ve been round on this merry-go-round more times than I can count. And in every timeline, you always end up following in his footsteps. The Flash: *Fastest Martyr Alive*.” He leaned forward. “Sometimes it’s sooner. Sometimes it’s later. But you just keep at it. Keep on sacrificing yourself like your old man. Whether I have anything to do with it or not.”

“So you just keep changing the timeline,” Barry shook his head, “to see me die in different ways?”

“Are you kidding me?” Reverse Flash sneered. “That’s the opposite of what I want. I don’t want you to die, Barry. I don’t want you to suffer. And I certainly don’t want you to abandon your family.”

Barry’s breath caught. His hands dropped. “Then why all the torture? Why do you insist on ruining my life? All of our lives?”

The baby’s cries swelled behind them. Patty sobbed softly, rocking him, trying to hush him, but the panic and confusion was too much for the infant, nevermind the sound.

“We’re scientists, Barry!” Reverse Flash’s voice rang out. “All of us Flashes are. Don’t you see? This is an experiment. I need to know - in times of crisis - what it takes.”

The baby cried louder. Iris touched Barry’s shoulder, trying to calm him, trying to shield the infant from the rage and energy pulsing through the room.

“So I create the crisis,” Reverse Flash continued. “Shift a variable here, another there. Closer and closer each time to my answer.”

Barry stared at him, hollowed out. “What it takes to do what?”

“To get you to stay.”

Barry reeled. His voice cracked. “Excuse me?”

“If you’re always going to be looking to the horizon,” Reverse Flash said gently, “waiting for one inevitable crisis or another to take you away… then I need to know what’ll get you to stay.”

There was a long silence. The baby whimpered softly now. Even the lights from the EMP seemed to quiet, casting the room in a pale, unreal glow.

Barry’s mouth moved, but no words came. His hands shook.

This wasn’t just evil. It wasn’t revenge. It was obsession. Mad experimentation. Reverse Flash had played god with their lives. Over and over again. This timeline, every timeline - it was just a petri dish for him to poke and prod at.

“Who would even do this…?” Barry muttered.

Then Patty cried out, sharp and sudden.

“Oh god!”

Barry pointed a finger at the Reverse Flash like a gun, heart thundering. “Who are you?”

Reverse Flash just shook his head, almost fondly. “You already know who I am.”

“No…” Barry whispered.

He turned slowly. Wally stood frozen in place, his eyes low, full of regret.

Barry looked to Patty. She was already staring at him.

They both understood. Dread like Barry had never felt before crawled up his spine.

He turned back to Reverse Flash.

And at the same time, he and Patty said it.

*“Jacob.”*

The evil speedster shut his eyes.

William blinked. “Jacob?”

The Reverse Flash - Jacob Spivot-Allen - smiled.

“Hi Mom.”

Patty screamed. “Oh god!” She broke down sobbing. Iris rushed to her side, pulling a blanket tighter around both her and the baby as if shielding them would undo any of this.

The adult Jacob didn’t move. He just stood there, expression calm. For the first time, his smile wasn’t mocking. It was sad. Like he took no pleasure in seeing his mother upset.

The room filled with the sound of Patty’s sobs. Barry didn’t breathe.

“This is insane,” William muttered, doubling over. His head was spinning. He looked up at Wally. “You knew about this?”

Wally didn’t answer.

“Don’t blame Wally,” the Reverse Flash said coolly, still pinned to the wall by Barry’s hand. “Most goes around, he dies in that cyclone he and his girlfriend made, so really, he has nothing to do with this.”

Wally flinched.

“Besides,” Jacob continued, “he and I both understood the dangers of wantonly meddling with the timeline. Even I wouldn’t interfere with the events of my own conception and birth. Hell, isn’t anyone impressed at how well I’ve timed this today?”

“You ruined our wedding!” Barry shouted. “Our relationship fell apart because of you!”

Jacob cringed, scrunching his nose. “Actually, *Dad*, your relationship fell apart because of all your lies, remember? Come on, you were so proud of yourself for that character growth. Don’t fall back now.”

No-one laughed. His smile faltered.

“Okay, I overdid it a bit,” Jacob muttered. “Had to give you some time off. Treat you with kid gloves while you and Mom worked it out.”

Barry looked like a man drowning. “What do you want?”

“I want you to make your choice,” Jacob said, his voice suddenly quiet. Measured. “Sacrifice yourself, save the cities, abandon your newborn son… or let the cities burn, embrace the unknown, and be the father he needs you to be.”

“I can’t just let everyone die.”

“Yes, you can!” Jacob snapped. The room pulsed. “Haven’t you learned that there’s always a choice!? Nothing is decided for you! You don’t get to act like choosing to leave isn’t exactly that, choosing!”

Red lightning snapped around him.

“Besides,” he added, quieter again, “you don’t have time to evacuate the blast zone. And even if you did, the state of the Speed Force afterwards might mean it didn’t matter anyway.”

“You’re asking me to choose armageddon.”

“I’m asking you to choose me!” Jacob erupted into a roar, tears in his eyes. “In every timeline, every iteration, you sacrifice yourself. Whether it’s some universe-ending cataclysm or just a tsunami. It’s always hero first. Father dead last.”

Barry’s jaw tensed. He rose to his full height. “And what happens if I don’t give you what you want? If I go to STAR Labs and save everyone?”

Jacob exhaled, already resigned. “Then I go back in time and try again. With all the data I collected from this iteration.” His eyes narrowed. “Starting with STAR Labs in 2019. The Speed Force Storm, and… Bart.”

“Bart!?” Patty clutched the baby Jacob tighter. “But… if you’re… then Bart is…”

“My son,” the adult Jacob said simply. “Last time around, I didn’t know he was the Flash I was up against. Or that he’d get in the way of my test for Dad. That was the plan: see how willing the old man was to sacrifice himself before his ‘hero career’ had even begun. But Bart got in the way, so I pivoted. And look at all we got out of it.”

Wally’s voice rose, sharp. “So you’re going to go back and do it again? Force Bart to feed himself to the Speed Force knowing he’s your son!?”

Jacob scoffed. “At first, I was furious at you, Barry. You got my son killed, and not for the first time. Turns out he takes after you and Grandpa Jay a lot, and just like you he ends up dead sacrificing himself in every timeline he comes to be born in.” The Reverse Flash tried to present himself as detached from it all, an objective scientist, but he did a terrible job. The hurt he felt for Bart’s repeated self sacrifice was hardly veiled at all. “So, as soon as I’m done figuring out how to stop you, I’ll move to figure out how to stop him - save him - too. But until I’ve gotten through to you, Barry… whether Bart lives or dies in any given timeline is immaterial.”

“How can you say that!?” Wally exclaimed.

“Because I’ve seen the course his death put us on,” the Reverse Flash replied, as if it were obvious. “This whole timeline: I’ve never gotten closer to the result I want. So, yeah. I think I’ll replicate those conditions next time.”

“You’re insane…” William whispered. Then louder. “You’re insane!”

He lunged at super speed, far too fast for the Reverse Flash to stop or evade. But Barry stopped him.

“I’m sorry, William.”

“You can’t be protecting him!”

“He’s my son.”

Wally stepped in. Put a steady hand on William’s shoulder. William relented. Just.

Barry turned back to Jacob. His eyes were wet, his voice trembling. “Jacob…” He choked the word out like it hurt to say. “I will stop you.”

“All you have to do is stop,” Jacob replied, almost pleading.

“I can’t, son.” Barry’s eyes welled. “You should have seen enough to realise that. I want so desperately to be a good father to you. The one you deserve. But surely you’ve seen the universe just has other plans! It’s like you said: even in timelines where you don’t interfere, something always happens that I need to die to stop.”

“The universe doesn’t make plans,” Jacob said bitterly. “People do.”

“Maybe you’re right,” Barry replied. “But maybe you’ve spent so long searching for what it takes to get me to stay… that you haven’t understood what it’s taking me to leave.”

Jacob’s eyes narrowed. “What is that supposed to mean?”

“I want to be a good father to you, Jacob. That’s always been my deepest wish.” Barry looked at the infant in Patty’s arms. “But I can’t let you, or any of the children of the world, grow up in a world ravaged by a disaster I had the power to stop.”

He turned back. “When you’re the Flash, you have the power to stop almost anything… but not the power to outrun death.”

Jacob’s voice wavered. “Why can’t you just be selfish for once?”

“For once?” Barry let out a bitter laugh. “Have you been paying attention?” He looked around the room. “I’ve been selfish time and time again. Keeping secrets. Lying. Hurting people. But when it really counts… I just don’t have it in me to be *that* selfish. I’m sorry.”

He stepped forward again. “But I can’t just leave you with nothing either.”

Jacob blinked. “What do you mean?”

“I will help you make this right.”

Jacob’s jaw tightened. “Right would be staying. Choosing me and Mom over the world.”

“I can’t,” Barry said. Then corrected himself. “I won’t. But I can help you fix something else.”

Jacob tilted his head. “And what’s that?”

Barry looked him dead in the eye. “The two of us are going back to 2019,” he said. “And we’re going to save your son.”

# Part 1: The Core Problem – Acknowledging the Content Creator's Struggle

# Section A: Introduction - The Never-Ending Demand for Fresh Visuals

If you’re reading this, chances are you know the feeling all too well. It’s that relentless pressure, the constant need to feed the content beast. Every social media channel, every blog post, every marketing campaign demands a steady stream of fresh, eye-catching visuals. It’s a never-ending cycle, and frankly, it can be exhausting.

You’ve probably been there, late at night, scrolling endlessly through stock photo sites, hoping to find an image that doesn’t look like it was taken in 1998 or used by every one of your competitors. Or maybe you’ve found yourself in a battle with complicated design software, spending hours on what should have been a simple graphic, only to feel disappointed with the result. And let’s not even talk about the gut-punch of seeing a price quote from a freelance designer for a single image. It’s a grind that can stifle creativity and slow down your progress.

Beyond the time and frustration, there's the very real financial drain. A subscription for a good image library, another for a video creation tool, and maybe one more for a decent editor. These monthly fees pile up, creating a significant overhead that can be a major hurdle for solo creators, small businesses, and marketers on a tight budget. It often feels like you’re forced to choose between producing high-quality work and staying within your means.

But what if there was another way? What if you could step off that hamster wheel of subscriptions and complexity? Picture this: a single dashboard where you can generate all the visual assets your business needs, from 4K videos to professional logos, all for a single, one-time payment. This is the very problem that[ MagicBeast AI](https://softtechhub.us/MagicBeast%20AI) aims to solve, presenting itself not just as another tool, but as a potential answer to the widespread challenges of cost, time, and creative friction.

# Part 2: A Deep Dive into the MagicBeast AI Toolkit

# Section B: Core Capabilities - The Arsenal at Your Fingertips

So, what’s actually included when you open up[ MagicBeast AI](https://softtechhub.us/MagicBeast%20AI)? It’s more than just a single-trick pony; it’s a suite of creative tools designed to handle a wide range of visual content needs. Let’s break down its arsenal into benefit-driven categories.

**1. The Motion Graphics Engine**

* **AI-Generated 4K Videos (HD and Animated):** This feature is a cornerstone of the platform. It allows you to take a simple keyword or an idea and have the AI generate a professional-looking video asset. This is perfect for creating short ads for social media, dynamic background videos for a website, or animated explainers that can grab and hold attention far better than a static image.
* **Cartoon & Storytelling Videos:** For content that requires a bit more personality, this tool lets you create narrative-driven or character-based videos. It’s a great way to tell your brand’s story, explain a complex topic in a simple way, or just create something fun and memorable that stands out from the typical corporate video style.

**2. The Static Image & Graphics Studio**

* **4K HD Image Generation:** Similar to the video tool, you can input text prompts to create photorealistic or artistic images from scratch. Need a unique hero image for your latest blog post or a custom graphic for an email newsletter? This tool ensures you have a one-of-a-kind visual that perfectly matches your message.
* **Specialized Image Creation (Logos, Sketches, Characters, Art):** The platform goes beyond just generating photos. It includes dedicated modules for creating specific types of graphics. You can generate a logo for a new business, create artistic sketches for a project, design a unique character for a brand, or produce abstract art for backgrounds and decorative elements.
* **AI Selfie & Headshot Generator:** This is a surprisingly practical feature. If you need a professional-looking headshot for your LinkedIn profile, website, or team page but don’t have the time or budget for a photoshoot, this tool can create stylized or professional profile pictures for you.

**3. The Intelligent Editing Suite**

* **Background Removal & Changer:** A must-have for anyone selling products online. You can take a photo of an item and instantly remove the background, allowing you to place it on a clean white backdrop or inside a different scene for lifestyle shots. It’s also incredibly useful for creating composite images for advertisements.
* **Image Enhancement Tools (Colorization, Denoising, Retouching):** These tools are designed to fix and improve the photos you already have. You can bring old black-and-white photos to life with color, clean up grainy images taken in low light, or perform minor touch-ups to improve the overall quality of a picture.

**4. Content Assistance**

* **AI Script Generation (for YouTube, Facebook, Instagram):** Creating a great video is only half the battle; you also need to know what to say. This tool helps you overcome writer’s block by generating a starting script for your video content. Just provide a topic, and it will give you a foundation that you can then edit and make your own.

# Section C: The Three-Step Creative Process

The goal of a tool like this is to make content creation faster and more accessible.[ MagicBeast AI](https://softtechhub.us/MagicBeast%20AI) streamlines the workflow into a simple, three-step process designed for speed and efficiency.

**Headline: How It Works: From Idea to Download in Minutes**

* **Step 1: Login:** Your journey starts by logging into the cloud-based user dashboard. This is the central hub where all the creative tools are located. Because it’s web-based, there’s nothing to download or install, and you can access it from any computer with an internet connection.
* **Step 2: Create:** This is where your ideas come to life. You first select the type of visual you want to create, whether it’s a ""4K HD Image,"" an ""Animated Video,"" or a ""Logo."" Then, you provide the AI with a keyword or a descriptive phrase. For instance, you could type ""a futuristic city skyline at dusk"" or ""a hand-drawn sketch of a vintage camera."" The AI takes your prompt and generates the asset for you.
* **Step 3: Download:** Once the AI has created your visual, you can preview it and then download the file directly to your computer. It’s now ready to be used in your project, whether you’re uploading it to your website, scheduling it on social media, or adding it to an ad campaign. The entire process is designed to take you from concept to a usable asset in just a few minutes.

# Part 3: Real-World Application and Profit

# Section D: Translating Features into Benefits

A list of features is interesting, but what matters is how they can actually help you in your day-to-day work. Let's look at who this tool is really for and the specific problems it can solve.

**Headline: Who Is This Really For, and How Can It Help?**

* **For Social Media Marketers:** Imagine being able to create a unique, custom visual for every single post, Reel, or story without spending hours in a design tool. This tool gives you an endless supply of content, helping you end your reliance on the same old stock photos and making your feed more engaging.
* **For Affiliate Marketers:** Instead of using the generic, overused ad creatives provided by affiliate programs, you can generate your own custom graphics and video ads. Unique visuals can help your campaigns stand out from the competition and may lead to better performance.
* **For E-commerce Owners:** The background removal tool alone can be a huge time-saver for producing clean, professional product shots. You can also create short, engaging promotional videos for your products without the high cost of hiring a video production agency.
* **For Local Businesses:** If you run a local business, you can become your own graphic designer. Create a new logo, design a flyer for an upcoming sale, or produce all the content for your social media channels without having to pay the high fees of a design firm.
* **For Bloggers & Content Creators:** Elevate your articles by adding unique, AI-generated images that perfectly illustrate your topic. This can make your posts more visually appealing, which can help keep readers on your page longer.

# Section E: Monetizing Your Access - The Commercial License

One of the most powerful parts of the standard package is the inclusion of a commercial license. This means you’re not just buying a tool for your own use; you’re acquiring an asset that can generate revenue.

**Headline: How to Turn MagicBeast AI into a Revenue Stream**

The commercial license gives you the legal right to sell the visuals you create to other people. This opens up a direct path to making money with the tool, allowing it to pay for itself and become a new income source. Here are just a few ideas for services you could offer:

* ""Social Media Graphic Packages for Local Businesses.""
* ""Custom YouTube Video Thumbnail Creation Service.""
* ""Affordable AI Logo Design for Startups.""
* ""Short Video Ad Production for Facebook & Instagram Campaigns.""

This shifts the tool from being an expense to being a business opportunity.

# Section F: A Personal Case Study - My Experience as a Beta Tester

To get a real feel for the platform, I decided to put it through its paces with a practical challenge: create a complete promotional package for a fictional local coffee shop, all in under two hours, using only the tools inside[ MagicBeast AI](https://softtechhub.us/MagicBeast%20AI).

**The Process:**

1. **Logo Creation:** I started with the AI Logo generator. I gave it the prompt, ""minimalist coffee bean logo, simple lines, brown and cream colors."" After a few variations, it produced a clean, modern design that looked professional and was a perfect fit.
2. **Social Media Content:** Next, I needed a week's worth of content for Instagram. I used the 4K Image generator with prompts like ""cozy coffee shop interior with warm lighting,"" ""close-up of detailed latte art,"" and ""friends laughing together over coffee."" I also created a short, looping animated video of a steaming coffee cup to add some motion to the feed.
3. **Promotional Video:** For the final piece, I tackled a 30-second promotional video. I used the AI 4K Video tool with a series of prompts like ""barista expertly pouring steamed milk,"" ""happy customers enjoying pastries,"" and ""welcoming exterior of a neighborhood coffee shop."" I then turned to the AI Script Generator for a simple voiceover text, which I could layer on top.

**The Outcome:**

In just under two hours, I had a professional logo, seven unique images for social media, an animated graphic, and a 30-second video ad. The speed and versatility were genuinely impressive. I did notice a learning curve when it came to writing effective prompts. My first few attempts were a bit too general, but once I started giving the AI more specific instructions, the quality of the output improved significantly. The experience convinced me that it's entirely feasible to use this tool for real client work, especially for businesses that need quality content produced quickly and affordably.

# Part 4: The Investment - Pricing, Upgrades, and Guarantees

# Section G: Pricing Structure and Funnel

# Part 5: Establishing Credibility

# Section I: Behind the Scenes - The Creator

[MagicBeast AI](https://softtechhub.us/MagicBeast%20AI) was developed by Kundan Choudhary, a known figure in the digital product space. His experience as a product vendor who has successfully launched other software tools in the past adds a layer of credibility. It suggests that this isn't a fly-by-night operation but a product backed by someone with a track record of supporting their creations.

# Section J: The Competitive Landscape

**Headline: MagicBeast AI vs. The Subscription Giants (Canva, Midjourney)**

How does a new tool like this compete with established players? The main differences come down to two key areas.

* **Core Differentiator #1: The Payment Model.** This is the most obvious distinction. Tools like Canva and Midjourney rely on recurring subscription fees that can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars over time. MagicBeast AI is built on a one-time payment model. You pay once and you get access to the tool. For anyone on a tight budget, the long-term savings can be substantial.
* **Core Differentiator #2: The All-in-One Dashboard.** Many creators find themselves patching together a workflow using multiple different tools—one for AI images, another for video, and a third for editing. MagicBeast AI brings all of these functions under one roof. This integrated approach can simplify your workflow, saving you time and the hassle of switching between different platforms.

# Section K: An Honest Assessment - Pros and Cons

To give you a clear picture, it’s important to look at both the strengths and potential drawbacks.

**The Upside (Pros):**

* **Cost-Effective:** The single low payment is a massive advantage in a market dominated by subscriptions.
* **Vast Feature Set:** You get a wide array of creative tools in one place, from video generation to image editing.
* **Commercial License Included:** The ability to monetize your creations is included from the start, offering a clear path to generating income.
* **Beginner-Friendly:** The straightforward 3-step process is designed to be accessible even if you have no design experience.

**The Considerations (Cons):**

* **The Funnel System:** To get the most powerful features, such as watermark removal and unlimited usage, you will need to invest in the optional upgrades. It's wise to consider the total cost if you need those advanced capabilities.
* **AI Variability:** As with all AI tools, the output can be unpredictable at times. You may need to experiment with different prompts and run several generations to get the perfect result.

# Section L: Launch Information and Access

* **Launch Date:**[ MagicBeast AI](https://softtechhub.us/MagicBeast%20AI) is set to launch on July 4, 2025, at 10:00 AM EDT.
* **Support:** The creators offer a 24/7 support desk to help with any questions or issues.
* **Platform:** This is a fully cloud-based application, so it works on any Mac or Windows computer with an internet connection.

**Headline: Extra Value Included During Launch**

These complementary materials provide strategies and knowledge to help you use the tool not just for your own projects, but also to build a business.

# Section N: Should You Get MagicBeast AI?

The final decision comes down to your individual situation. This tool might be a great fit for you, or it might not.

* You are a professional designer or video editor who needs the precision and deep feature set of high-end software like the Adobe Creative Suite.
* You prefer to buy software with a single, all-inclusive price and are not a fan of sales funnels with optional upgrades.
* Your creative needs are very specific. For example, if you only need a tool to remove backgrounds, a dedicated single-purpose app might be more suitable.

When I initially got my 1Zpresso X-Ultra I had to grind s few grams of beans espresso fine befor first use, idk exactly why but it was recommended. I decided not to waste the coffe beans though and just dilute it like crazy compared to normal and it turned out alright.

This was the method I initially thought of using for the coffee, but then I would get a high volume which isn't great because it will dilute the hot chocolate.

If I brew like normal it wouldn't taste much chocolate or be very much chocolate and make a really small cup of coffee. But I got one more crazy idea, you might want to sitdown for this one.

If I make hot chocolate and pour it through the coffee, which effectively just replaces the brewing water with hot chocolate.

I don't expect people to be experts at this, but if you have your own ideas/methods please share. If not it would be nice to know what people think is the best/least weird way fo doing it. Thanks for reading this far.",1,1751543264.0,pourover,2,0.67,False

I was having coffee at a café when I saw this guy really well groomed, and honestly just… attractive. We had a brief moment of eye contact while he picked up his coffee, and then he walked out and sat in his car. His windows were pretty tinted, so I couldn’t see clearly, but I knew it was him.

For some reason I can’t explain, I decided to walk up and say hi. I’ve never approached a guy in my life. But something inside me just pushed me. I walked up to his car and lightly knocked on the window. He rolled it down, and I quietly said, “Hey…”

But right then I realized he seemed to be in the middle of a meeting or a call he looked a bit surprised and clearly busy. He said to me I’m in a meeting  I instantly felt this wave of awkwardness wash over me, panicked, and walked away without saying anything else.

Now I’m stuck replaying the moment in my head over and over. That uncomfortable feeling won’t leave. At the same time, there’s a small part of me that feels weirdly proud that I even tried. I stepped out of my comfort zone, even if it didn’t go how I imagined.

I guess I just needed to let this out. It’s a strange mix of embarrassment and growth. And maybe next time, I’ll stay long enough to finish a full sentence.",12,1751542931.0,indiasocial,16,0.75,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, PLEASE ONLY MESSAGE IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

1lqn9i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/glastonbury_festival/comments/1lqn9i9/holt_farm_honest_review/,Holt Farm - Honest Review,"I loved it.

  
So firstly I'll start with the reason we decided to go for it; I just didn't want the anxiety of walking around the site trying to find a plot big enough for us to fit both tents, I know plenty of people aren't fussed about that, but we had coach tickets and had no idea what time we were going to get (turned out to be 16:15 on the Wednesday so we arrived gone 18:30). I also didn't want the long drops to be my only toilet source and I wanted to be able to shower.

  
It delivered all that and more.

  
I was a bit apprehensive when I saw people saying it takes an hour to get into the main site, but I'm genuinely confused as to where that comes from. It was 30 seconds from Gate D - and then about 20-30 minutes walk into the main area from there (which is around the same time it takes for most of the camping around the outskirts inside the festival anyway), no idea how people are taking an hour unless they're going a really odd route or are super slow.

  
Going through security each morning was a bit annoying, especially with how anal the ticket checkers are, but took 5 minutes max and they barely search you, they're just basically checking for glass/weapons.  


The only time I had to queue for a (hot) shower for more than 10 minutes was on the Friday morning at about 8.30am - all the other mornings it was a pretty small queue, the showers were decent, not amazing though; you have to constantly turn the water back on and despite the signs people definitely take their shoes in there because my feet came out dirtier each time than when I went in... but they did the job of waking me up.

  
The toilets are flushable portaloos, but they were always clean (apart from Monday morning), there were plenty of them so rarely had to queue, they flushed, were stocked with toilet paper and didn't smell at all (again, apart from Monday when they were utterly grim).

  
We went for the ""general"" area, but even so people were respectful, no music, loud noise or anything - granted I was only in my tent from about 3/4am until around 9am each day - but during those hours I hardly heard a peep so got as much sleep as my body allowed.

  
The bonus bits - the bar is great, reasonable prices, comfy seating, decent tunes, and a really nice atmosphere. There were good food trucks and 2 coffee trucks, but the queues for these were long in the morning, which wasn't ideal but, unless you were rushing off to see someone early morning, it wasn't really an issue.

  
I saw people talking about a downside being not being in the thick of it, and I do get that completely, but I still chatted with our tent neighbours, and was only really at the tent when I was asleep anyway. I feel like maybe the only thing I missed out on was chilling playing our own music around the tent area but, as we spent 90% of our time in the main area, this didn't feel like a huge loss. I personally didn't feel like I missed out on anything major by being there.

  
All in all, I'd 100% do it again as it got rid of a level of anxiety that I had in the lead up, and made my time there just slightly more comfortable. It was well worth it for the 3x3 plot (although if they massively up the rates in 2027, I may think twice....)",2,1751542420.0,glastonbury_festival,2,0.75,False

**Virelle had dressed, though her blouse hung open to reveal a trail of hickeys she flaunted with pride.** 

**And my arm, lifting the coffee bags, showed scabbed–over wounds beneath the sleeve.** 

**“It took you long enough. They’re cold now.”** 

**Virelle pouted.** 

**After I reheated them, she grabbed a cup, pretended to fumble, and spilled it on me–right on my open wounds.** 

**She covered her mouth, gasping in feigned horror.** 

**Erevan rushed over when he heard the commotion. His eyes skimmed over me, then softened with concern for Virelle.**

**My white shirt soaked instantly, clinging wetly to my skin.** 

**“You can’t even handle this? Liora, this is your punishment.”** 

**The liquid dripped down my bangs, stinging my eyes, blurring my vision.** 

**That made me could barely make out his furious face.** 

**Two seconds later, I bowed my head actively.** 

**“I’m sorry.”** 

**I’d apologized, but instead of softening, his expression turned colder.** 

**That night, Erevan had a formal banquet.** 

**In the past, I had always been the one to accompany him to these business functions. But this time, he brought Virelle too.** 

**He must’ve really liked her.** 

**When choosing my dress, I picked a long–sleeved gown that covered all my wounds.** 

**Erevan frowned. “Why are you wrapped up like that?”** 

**Before I could explain, he added, “Whatever. You’re just Virelle’s background tonight anyway. I don’t need you making an impression like you used to.”** 

**The banquet hall buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses. Many guests came to toast Erevan.** 

**Virelle shrank into his arms, shy and helpless.** 

**“Erevan, I can’t drink…‘** 

**He caressed her gently. “It’s okay, baby. Someone else can drink for you.”** 

**I said nothing, silently accepting glass after glass of red wine and champagne from his business partners.** 

**Once, I only drank for Erevan. Now, I drank for Virelle too.** 

**My stomach burned, cramps twisting inside me.** 

**I barely winced from the pain, but Erevan sharply noticed.** 

**“What’s the matter? I thought you could handle your liquor. Only a few dozen glasses and you’re already tapping out?”** 

**An older Alpha across the table laughed. “Come on, Liora’s known for her drinking. Don’t tell me you’re disrespecting me?”** 

**Erevan’s gaze was icy.** 

**“Liora, apologize to Mr. Gideon. If he’s not pleased tonight, don’t bother showing your face at the Rosenoir Pack tomorrow.”**

For context, I have a sweet little girl of approximately 6 weeks. Things have been a little rough, the birth experience went completely sideways from our original plan. (Wanted unmediated birth center birth- found out baby had FGR and ended up in the hospital with a c-section. Baby ended up needing resuscitating and spent a week in the NICU.) I’m still healing mentally from the whole situation. Sometimes I think “things are getting better!” And then it hits me hard again. It doesn’t feel like “baby blues.” I love my child, but I feel like I’m missing that intense bond mothers get after child birth. Because of this, I can’t say that I resent her but I’m left wondering when will I feel that attachment to her to make this all worth it?

On top of this, my husband and I are at odds everyday. I miss him and I miss us. We don’t sleep together anymore because we have to take shifts watching her or else we go crazy with no sleep. Once we are awake together, I feel like all I do is lecture or nag him. We’re dealing with some major life changes besides baby coming into the picture, and it feels like I’m alone in this. When an issue presents- diaper rash, etc. I’m the one solving it and researching or making appointments. He doesn’t listen to what I say and I have to “pop quiz” him after a single sentence to make sure he’s still hearing me. I recognize the effort he does put in daily by completing basic house chores, taking turns changing baby and feeding her… but it feels like all we do together now is get on each others nerves. When I’m not nagging him to help me, his schtick has been to criticize me over little things like where something is placed on our coffee table, or how I wash dishes. I want my husband back. It feels like becoming parents has made us into different people and I just want to feel connected to him again. I feel so alone. I’ve tried to do things for him to make him feel appreciated (thinking maybe I’m the problem)- had food and coffee specially ordered for him to wake up to, completing his side of chores, doing “sexual favors” to satiate him while I’m unable to have intercourse, back rubs, etc. I can’t figure out where the disconnect is. We’ve talked it out multiple times now and he doesn’t give me anything to work with. Just that he’s tired.

How do we get back to brass tacks? If I can’t “feel like myself” then how do I at least connect with my husband while I’m healing? I want to feel loved. Right now I just feel like a nag. When I became a mother, it feels like I became HIS mother. I just need my partner in crime back.",3,1751542183.0,beyondthebump,4,1.0,False

as the title already states I'm a 31-year-old queer leftist woman from Germany.   
  
\- I work in IT-support and study business administration part time (meaning most of my weekends)  
\- mostly a homebody and an introvert  
\- enjoy watching Youtube and Twitch (everything from minimalism to left content creators, with a bit of gaming content from time to time)  
\- enjoy reading (currently trying to reduce the amount of unread nonfiction books so I can concentrate more on fiction - psychothrillers, YA, a bit of everything)  
\- occasionally enjoy going for a run and also trying to build some more muscle again, I'm nowhere near fit though  
\- occasionally meeting up with my few but very cherished friends

I'm a rambling mess and tend to complain a lot about small stuff (especially in real life), which doesn't mean I'm not content with my life. 

Even though I'm an introvert and love my friends very much, I would love to get to know more people.

\- people roughly around my age  
\- people living in Germany / Europe to keep timezones kinda compatible  
\- long-term connections preferably, but if we don't click that's fine

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

1lqmyms,https://youtu.be/aNajJ4APzBw,3 Very Scary TRUE Repair Shop Horror Stories,"# ""After Hours"":

I’d only been working at the repair shop for a few months, still getting used to the late-night shifts. The place was old, with concrete floors stained black from years of oil spills. Wrenches, screwdrivers, and greasy rags cluttered the workbenches, and the air smelled like metal and gasoline. The fluorescent lights buzzed faintly, casting long shadows that danced across the walls. It was past 10 PM on a Thursday, and I was alone, finishing up some paperwork at the front desk. The owner, Mr. Johnson, had left hours ago, trusting me to lock up.

The clock on the wall ticked loudly, the only sound breaking the silence. Outside, the street was dark, with just a faint glow from a distant streetlamp. I was ready to call it a night when a sharp knock on the glass door made me jump. I looked up and saw a man standing there, his face half-hidden in the shadows. He was tall, with a scruffy beard and wild eyes that darted nervously. His jacket was torn, and he clutched a set of keys so tightly his knuckles were white.

I hesitated. The shop was closed, and I wasn’t supposed to let anyone in after hours. But he looked desperate, and I didn’t want to leave him stranded. I walked to the door and opened it a crack. “Can I help you?” I asked, my voice steady but cautious.

“Hey, sorry to bother you so late,” he said, his voice low and shaky, with a faint slur like he’d been drinking. “My car broke down a few blocks away. I need to get it towed, but I want to siphon the gas out first. Can you help me with that?”

I studied him for a moment. Something about him felt off—maybe it was the way he kept glancing over his shoulder or the sweat beading on his forehead despite the cool night air. But I pushed the thought aside. “Sure, I guess,” I said. “Let me grab a gas can.”

I stepped into the back room to grab a can, my boots echoing on the concrete. When I returned, he was already inside, standing too close to the counter where we kept the cash register. “Ready?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

“Yeah, let’s do this,” he said, flashing a quick smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

We walked to his car, an old VW Beetle parked crookedly on the side of the road. It was a wreck—dents and scratches covered the body, and the front bumper hung loose like it had been in a crash. “Rough night, huh?” I said, trying to make small talk.

“You could say that,” he muttered, avoiding my gaze. He kept talking as we walked back to the shop, rambling about how he needed the gas for another vehicle and couldn’t afford to waste it. His words came too fast, like he was trying to fill the silence. I nodded, but my focus was on getting this over with so I could go home.

Back in the shop, he stopped near the workbench and pointed at the shop vacuum in the corner. “Let’s use that,” he said. “It’ll be faster.”

I froze. “The shop vacuum? That’s not safe. Gas fumes can ignite.”

He waved his hand dismissively, his smile tightening. “Come on, it’ll be fine. I’ve done it before.”

I stared at him, my gut twisting. Every mechanic knows you don’t mess with gas and electric motors. But I was tired, and he was insistent, and I didn’t want to argue with a stranger in the middle of the night. “Alright,” I said reluctantly, “but we need to be careful.”

He grabbed the vacuum and a length of tubing, his hands shaking as he set it up. I noticed he kept glancing around the shop, his eyes lingering on the cash register and the shelves where we kept expensive tools. I went to the back to grab more tubing, and when I came back, he was near the counter again, his hand hovering over a drawer. My heart skipped a beat.

“What are you looking for?” I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.

He jumped, his hand snapping back. “Oh, nothing,” he said, laughing nervously. “Just curious about the place.”

I didn’t buy it, but I didn’t push. We moved to the car, and he stuck the tubing into the gas tank. The vacuum whirred to life, a low, grinding hum that filled the shop. The smell of gasoline grew stronger, sharp and heavy in the air. I stood a few feet away, watching him closely. His hands were unsteady, and he kept looking toward the door, like he was expecting someone—or planning to run.

Then I noticed it—a faint wisp of smoke curling from the vacuum. The smell of gas was overwhelming now, stinging my nose. My stomach dropped. “Hey, turn it off!” I shouted, stepping toward him. “It’s gonna—”

Before I could finish, there was a deafening *whoosh*. The vacuum exploded in a blinding flash of fire, the force slamming me backward. I hit the concrete floor hard, my head spinning. Debris rained down—bits of metal and plastic clattering around me. When I opened my eyes, flames were licking up the walls, devouring the shelves of oil cans and rags. The shop was a furnace, the heat pressing against my skin.

The man was on the floor, groaning, but he was already scrambling to his feet. In his hand, I saw it—a small black wallet, one that didn’t belong to him. It must have come from the drawer by the cash register. My blood ran cold. He hadn’t been here to siphon gas. He’d been planning to rob the place, and the vacuum was just a distraction.

The fire roared, spreading to the ceiling. I stumbled to my feet, coughing as smoke filled my lungs. I grabbed the fire extinguisher from the wall and yanked the pin, spraying foam at the flames. But they were too big, too fast. The man was at the door now, yanking at the handle, but it wouldn’t budge. The explosion must have warped the frame.

“Help me!” he screamed, his voice raw with panic. “It’s stuck!”

I kept spraying the extinguisher, my arms shaking as the heat grew unbearable. “Hold on!” I yelled, my throat burning. The flames were closing in, the air thick with black smoke. I could barely see, my eyes watering, my chest tight.

Finally, the extinguisher slowed the fire enough for me to reach the door. I threw my weight against it, shoulder slamming into the metal. The man pushed too, his hands slick with sweat. With a groan, the door gave way, and we stumbled outside, collapsing onto the pavement. I gasped for air, my lungs aching, my skin stinging from the heat.

Sirens wailed in the distance—someone must have seen the flames and called the fire department. I turned to the man, ready to confront him about the wallet, but he was already on his feet, sprinting down the street. “Stop!” I shouted, but my voice was weak, and he didn’t look back.

The fire trucks arrived minutes later, their lights flashing in the dark. The firefighters put out the remaining flames, but the shop was a mess—charred walls, melted tools, and the smell of burnt rubber everywhere. I told the police everything, about the man, the vacuum, the wallet. They said he matched the description of a local thief known for hitting small businesses. They never caught him.

Mr. Johnson was furious about the damage, but when I explained what happened, he softened. He still docked my pay for the ruined vacuum, but I didn’t care. I was just glad to be alive.

That night changed me. I never worked late alone again, and I started locking the door the second the shop closed. Every time I smell gasoline or hear a vacuum hum, my heart races, and I’m back in that moment—the explosion, the flames, the man’s wild eyes as he tried to run.





# ""The Last Shift at Huber’s"":

I’ll never forget the day Harvey disappeared. It was February 25, 2020, a Tuesday I can’t shake from my mind. I was working late at Huber’s Auto Repair, just another night under the hood of a Chevy Malibu, my hands greasy from tightening bolts. I’m Tom, been fixing cars here for years. Harvey, my boss, gave me a chance when no one else would. He was a good guy—tough but fair, always joking with customers. But that night, something felt wrong.

I was finishing up when I heard voices from the back office, loud and sharp. Harvey was arguing with Josh, a young mechanic who’d been messing up lately. Josh was careless, always leaving tools out or scratching a fender.

“Josh, I’ve told you before,” Harvey said, his voice cutting through the shop. “Be careful with the customers’ cars. That dent on the bumper? That’s coming out of your pay.”

“It wasn’t me, Harvey!” Josh shot back. “It was already there, I swear!”

“I don’t care,” Harvey said. “You’re responsible for your bay. End of story.”

I tried to focus on my work, but the argument stuck with me. Harvey sounded angrier than usual, like something else was eating at him. I figured it was just shop stress. Running a business isn’t easy.

Around 9:30 p.m., I was locking up when I noticed Harvey’s truck still parked outside. That was odd. He always left before me, eager to get home to his wife, Melissa. Maybe he was buried in paperwork, I thought. I decided to check.

I knocked on the office door. Silence. I turned the handle—it was unlocked. The lights were on, but Harvey was gone. His wallet, keys, phone, and a half-eaten sandwich sat on the desk, like Roscoe’s collar still around his neck. It was like he’d vanished mid-bite.

“Harvey?” I called, my voice bouncing off the concrete walls. No answer. I checked the shop, the storage yard out back, everywhere. Nothing. The yard was just cars waiting for repairs, but I noticed a tarp missing from one of them. I’d seen it earlier that day, covering a beat-up Ford. Now it was gone. I brushed it off—maybe Harvey moved it—but it nagged at me.

I called Melissa to see if Harvey was home. She answered after a few rings, her voice calm but distant.

“Hi, Melissa, it’s Tom from the shop,” I said. “Is Harvey there? His truck’s still here, and he’s not in the office.”

A pause. “No, he’s not home,” she said. “He mentioned staying late for some work. Did you check everywhere?”

“Yeah, he’s not here. His stuff’s on the desk. I’m a little worried.”

“He might’ve gone for a walk,” she said. “He does that to clear his head sometimes.”

“Maybe,” I said, unconvinced. “I’ll wait a bit, see if he shows up.”

“Keep me posted,” she said, and hung up.

Harvey walking 20 miles home? Without his wallet or keys? It didn’t add up. The shop was out in the middle of nowhere, just off Interstate 35. I waited an hour, pacing the empty shop, the hum of the air compressor the only sound. Still no Harvey. I called the police and reported him missing.

The next few days were chaos. Cops came, asked questions, searched the area. Nothing. Harvey was gone, like he’d been erased. Customers stopped coming; the shop felt like a ghost town. Josh was jumpy, always looking over his shoulder. I couldn’t blame him. The air felt heavy, like the shop itself was holding its breath.

A week later, I got to work early and saw police cars near the drainage tunnel off the interstate, a stone’s throw from the shop. My stomach twisted as I walked over. A crowd had gathered—cops, some locals, a Texas Ranger named Reid.

“What’s happening?” I asked an officer, my voice shaky.

“We found something,” he said, his face grim. “A piece of skull. Might be tied to your boss’s case.”

My knees went weak. “Harvey?” I whispered.

“Possibly,” he said. “We’re still testing.”

Days later, more remains turned up in dumpsters around Georgetown. Tests confirmed it was Harvey. He’d been hit in the head with an ax, his body chopped up and scattered. The news hit like a punch. Harvey, the guy who’d slip me an extra twenty for lunch, was gone—brutally.

The shop became a nightmare. Every creak of the floorboards made me jump. Josh quit, saying he couldn’t handle the “bad vibes.” I stayed, needing the job, but it wasn’t the same. The police kept digging, and eventually, they arrested Jimmy Tschoerner, a tow truck driver who worked with us sometimes. Word was he’d been having an affair with Melissa. He confessed, got 60 years. Melissa was questioned but never charged. She sold the shop and left town, like she couldn’t stand the sight of it anymore.

But that wasn’t the end. A month after Jimmy’s arrest, weird things started happening. Tools moved when no one was around. Papers I’d stacked neatly on the desk ended up scattered. I told myself it was my imagination, but it didn’t feel right.

One night, I was working late, around 10 p.m., alone in the shop. The air compressor hummed, a low drone that usually faded into the background. Then I heard it—a rustling from the office, like someone rifling through drawers. My heart pounded. I grabbed a wrench, my palms sweaty, and crept toward the door.

“Who’s there?” I called. Silence.

I peeked inside. The room was empty, but a drawer was open, papers spilled across the floor. I hadn’t touched them. My breath caught as I cleaned up, and that’s when I saw it—a rag under the desk, stained with dark, crusty blood. We used rags like that for oil spills, but this blood was fresh, or at least it looked that way. My stomach churned. I tossed it in the trash, hands shaking, and tried to convince myself it was nothing.

The next day, I told Josh over coffee. He laughed, nervous. “You’re spooked, Tom. After Harvey, it’s no wonder you’re seeing things.”

But I wasn’t seeing things. That night, I set up a small camera behind some files on the office shelf, aimed at the desk. I locked the front door, made a show of leaving, then slipped back in through the side entrance. I hid in the storage room, heart thumping, waiting in the dark.

Hours dragged. The shop was silent except for the occasional drip of oil somewhere. I was about to give up when the office door creaked. I peered through a crack in the storage room door. A figure in a hoodie and gloves slipped inside, moving fast. They went straight to the desk, pulling out drawers, then reached underneath and grabbed a small box. My blood froze. Who was this?

They turned, hood shadowing their face, and looked right at the storage room door. I ducked back, pulse hammering. When I looked again, they were gone. I ran to the office—empty. The box was open on the desk, and inside were Harvey’s keys, the ones the police had taken as evidence. How were they here?

I grabbed the camera and keys and bolted, locking up behind me. The next day, I showed the footage to the police. They were skeptical until they saw the figure, clear as day, moving through the office. They set up a stakeout, and a few nights later, they caught her—Melissa.

She broke down, sobbing. She hadn’t killed Harvey, she swore, but she knew Jimmy did it. She’d helped him get rid of the body, too scared to come forward. She’d been sneaking into the shop, looking for a hidden ledger Harvey kept, one that detailed her affair with Jimmy. She thought it could still ruin her.

Melissa was arrested, charged with tampering with evidence. The shop’s under new ownership now, but I still work here, fixing cars in the same bays where Harvey used to joke around. Late at night, when it’s just me and the hum of the compressor, I feel him—his presence, heavy in the air, like he’s waiting for something. Justice, maybe. Or maybe just watching, making sure I don’t forget.





# ""The Chop Shop"":

I never thought a simple oil change would turn into a nightmare. My old sedan had been making a weird noise, so I took it to Joe’s Auto Repair, a grimy shop on the edge of town. The place looked like it hadn’t been touched in years—peeling paint, a flickering neon sign that buzzed like a dying fly, and a lot full of cars that seemed more abandoned than in for repairs. The air was thick with the smell of oil and rust. It was the only shop that could take me that day, so I ignored the uneasy feeling in my gut.

I handed my keys to Joe, a burly mechanic with grease-stained hands and a name tag pinned crookedly to his shirt. He barely looked at me, just grunted, “Be a few hours,” and shuffled into the back, his boots scuffing the cracked concrete floor. Something about his shifty eyes made my skin crawl, but I brushed it off. I just needed my car fixed.

I sat in the waiting area, a tiny room with stained chairs and a coffee table covered in old magazines. After an hour, I got restless and wandered toward the garage. The big doors were open, and I peeked inside. Rows of cars sat with their hoods up, parts scattered like puzzle pieces. Some looked too new to be in a place like this, their interiors stripped bare. I noticed a sleek black SUV with no license plates, its engine half-dismantled. It didn’t feel right, but I told myself it was just a busy shop.

When I returned that afternoon, Joe was behind the counter, wiping his hands on a rag, his face pale. “Where’s my car?” I asked, my voice sharper than I meant it to be.

He didn’t meet my eyes. “Uh, it was stolen. Must’ve happened while we were working on it.”

“Stolen?” I stepped closer, my heart pounding. “It was inside the garage, wasn’t it?”

“We had to move it outside for a bit,” he mumbled, still avoiding my gaze. “Someone probably saw it and took their chance.”

I didn’t buy it. The lot was fenced, and I hadn’t seen any broken gates. Why would they move my car outside? Joe’s story stank worse than the oil in his shop. I pressed him, but he just repeated the same excuse, his hands shaking slightly as he stuffed the rag into his pocket.

I left, furious and uneasy. That night, I couldn’t sleep, replaying Joe’s nervous behavior. The next day, I started asking around. I stopped by the diner across the street, where an old man named Mr. Thompson sipped coffee at the counter. He’d lived in the area forever and knew everyone’s business.

“Joe’s shop?” He snorted, setting down his mug. “That place is trouble. Cars come and go at all hours. I’ve seen guys in hoodies loading parts into vans at midnight. Never trusted Joe. You be careful, kid.”

His words stuck with me. I decided to dig deeper, but then the calls started. The first one came at 2 a.m., just heavy breathing on the line. I hung up, thinking it was a prank. The next night, a low voice growled, “Stop asking questions, or you’ll regret it.” My stomach dropped. I checked my doors twice before bed.

I couldn’t let it go. That car was my lifeline—I needed it for my delivery job. So, I hatched a plan. Late one night, I drove my friend’s borrowed truck to the shop, parking a block away. The place was dark, the neon sign off, but a faint light glowed from the back. I crept through the lot, sticking to the shadows, my heart hammering so loud I thought it’d give me away.

The side door was unlocked, which should’ve been my first red flag. Inside, the garage was a maze of cars and tools, the air heavy with the smell of metal. I moved quietly, my sneakers silent on the concrete. Then I heard voices from a back room, low and urgent. I ducked behind a stack of tires, my breath shallow.

“We gotta move the parts tonight,” one voice said, sharp and nervous. “That guy’s been snooping. He’s gonna ruin everything.”

“Don’t worry,” another voice replied, cold as ice. “I’ll handle him.”

My blood ran cold. They were talking about me. I needed proof—something to take to the police. I spotted a door slightly ajar, the light spilling out. I inched closer, peering inside. The room was filled with car parts—engines, tires, even a stack of license plates. A table held bags of what looked like cash and some white powder. This wasn’t just a repair shop. It was a chop shop, maybe worse.

I pulled out my phone to take a picture, but my hands were shaking. Before I could snap a shot, I tripped over a wrench, and it clattered to the floor. The voices stopped. Footsteps echoed, heavy and fast.

“Who’s there?” the cold voice barked.

I bolted for the side door, but it was locked now. Panic surged through me. I scanned the garage, spotting a grimy window above a workbench. I scrambled up, grabbed a hammer, and smashed the glass. Shards rained down as I climbed through, slicing my palm on the jagged edge. I didn’t care—I just ran.

I didn’t stop until I reached the truck, my chest heaving, blood dripping from my hand. I drove straight to Mr. Thompson’s house, banging on his door at 3 a.m. He opened it, bleary-eyed but concerned.

“They’re running a chop shop,” I gasped, showing him my bloody hand. “I heard them. They’re after me.”

He didn’t hesitate. “We’re going to the police. Now.”

At the station, I told the officers everything—the missing car, the threats, the back room. Mr. Thompson backed me up, mentioning the late-night vans he’d seen. The police took it seriously, promising to investigate.

The next evening, I got a call from the detective. “We raided Joe’s shop,” he said. “Found stolen car parts, drugs, and a couple of guns. Your car was there, dismantled. Joe and his crew are in custody.”

I stood outside the shop that night, watching police lights flash as they hauled Joe away in handcuffs. My car was gone, chopped up for parts, but I felt a strange relief. I’d uncovered the truth, even if it nearly cost me everything.

I moved to a new town after that, starting fresh. But I still check my locks every night, and I’ll never trust a repair shop again.",1,1751541366.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1lqmxvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1lqmxvf/before_agents_were_the_rage_i_built_a_a_group_of/,"Before agents were the rage I built a a group of AI agents to summarize, categorize importance, and tweet on US laws and activity legislation. Here is the breakdown if you are interested in it. It's a dead project, but I thought the community could gleam some insight from it.","For a long time I had wanted to build a tool that provided unbiased, factual summaries of legislation that were a little more detail than the average summary from congress.gov. If you go on the website there are usually 1 pager summaries for bills that are thousands of pages, and then the plain bill text... who wants to actually read that shit?

News media is slanted, so I wanted to distill it from the source, at least, for myself with factual information. The bills going through for Covid, Build Back Better, Ukraine funding, CHIPS, all have a lot of extra features built in that most of it goes unreported. Not to mention there are hundreds of bills signed into law that no one hears about. I wanted to provide a method to absorb that information that is easily palatable for us mere mortals with 5-15 minutes to spare. I also wanted to make sure it wasn't one or two topic slop that missed the whole picture.

Initially I had plans of making a website that had cross references between legislation, combined session notes from committees, random commentary, etc all pulled from different sources on the web. However, to just get it off the ground and see if I even wanted to deal with it, I started with the basics, which was a twitter bot.

Over a couple months, a lot of coffee and money poured into Anthropic's API's, I built an agentic process that pulls info from congress(dot)gov. It then uses a series of local and hosted LLMs to parse out useful data, summaries, and make tweets of active and newly signed legislation. It didn’t gain much traction, and maintenance wasn’t worth it, so I haven’t touched it in months (the actual agent is turned off).  

Basically this is how it works:

1. A custom made scraper pulls data from congress(dot)gov and organizes it into small bits with overlapping context (around 15000 tokens and 500 tokens of overlap context between bill parts)
2. When new text is available to process an AI agent (local - llama 2 and then eventually 3) reviews the data parsed and creates summaries
3. When summaries are available an AI agent reads summaries of bill text and gives me an importance rating for bill
4. Based on the importance another AI agent (usually google Gemini) writes a relevant and useful tweet and puts the tweets into queue tables 
5. If there are available tweets to a job posts the tweets on a random interval from a few different tweet queues from like 7AM-7PM to not be too spammy.

I had two queue's feeding the twitter bot - one was like cat facts for legislation that was already signed into law, and the other was news on active legislation.

At the time this setup had a few advantages. I have a powerful enough PC to run mid range models up to 30b parameters. So I could get decent results and I didn't have a time crunch. Congress(dot)gov limits API calls, and at the time google Gemini was free for experimental stuff in an unlimited fashion outside of rate limits.

It was pretty cheap to operate outside of writing the code for it. The scheduler jobs were python scripts that triggered other scripts and I had them run in order at time intervals out of my VScode terminal. At one point I was going to deploy them somewhere but I didn't want fool with opening up and securing Ollama to the public. I also pay for x premium so I could make larger tweets and bought a domain too... but that's par for the course for any new idea I am headfirst into a dopamine rush about.

But yeah, this is an actual agentic workflow for something, feel free to dissect, or provide thoughts. Cheers!",2,1751541300.0,AI_Agents,2,1.0,False

You know that feeling when you wake up and your room looks *almost* right—like someone rearranged it in your sleep? Your pillow's a little too cold. The clock's ticking the wrong way. Your own reflection is watching you before you’ve opened your eyes.

That’s what last night felt like… **before** I even clocked in.

There was no envelope this time.

Instead, when I entered the booth, the monitor was already on—flickering between camera feeds I didn’t recognize. Hallways I’d never patrolled. Angles that felt *impossible*, like the camera was filming from inside the walls.

Then, the radio whispered:

>

The voice was mine.

But not tired. Not panicked. Not like I am now.

It sounded *excited*.

I didn’t bring a flashlight. I didn’t bring coffee. I didn’t even bring the bolt cutters this time.

**Because I couldn’t find them.**  
My fridge was empty. My bag had only a cracked Polaroid of myself in the mirrored food court—one that hadn’t existed until last shift.

At 12:13 AM, the lights turned purple.

Not flickering. Not buzzing.

Just a deep, electric violet glow, like the mall had decided **night wasn’t dark enough anymore.**

Then a new message scrolled across the monitor:

# Mirror Shift C – Last Protocol

**(Voluntary)**  
**You know the risks. You agreed to the consequences.**  
**The mall remembers. The mall reflects. The mall selects.**

I started my walk.

Every hallway felt stretched, like I was walking underwater.

When I passed Sunglass Hut, **my reflection didn’t follow**.

It stood still. Smiled.  
Then **walked the other way.**

At 2:03 AM, the janitor appeared. Only now, he had no mop. Just a long, curved shard of glass strapped to his belt like a sword.

He nodded at me.

Whispered, **""Don't let it see you bleed.""**

Then he vanished behind a wall that shouldn’t have had a door.

At 3:00 AM, I reached the mirrored fountain again.

But now, instead of coins, the water was filled with **faces**—mine, and others—melted and screaming, trapped beneath the surface. One was my dad. He mouthed:  
**""RUN.""**

But I didn’t.

Because behind me, I heard footsteps. Heavy. Slippery. Like something crawling with weight it shouldn’t have.

I turned too fast.

And saw…

**Me.**

But tall. Too tall. Arms wrong. Mouth just… *open*—wide and trembling, like it was stuck mid-scream. The skin had **no pores. No texture. Just smooth, mirror-polished flesh.**

Its eyes were like holes carved in mercury.

It moved like it knew I wouldn’t.

Then it lunged.

I don’t remember much after that.

Just choking on my own voice.

Bleeding from somewhere behind my own eyes.

Then a sound: like glass exploding *inward*.

I woke up **on my living room floor**.

Fully clothed. Shoes wet. Mall badge on my chest.

My clock said **7:09 AM**.

On my TV, security footage played on loop: me standing alone in the mirrored mall. Motionless. Breathing. Watching myself.

It hasn't stopped playing since.

I called in sick. I haven’t gone back. I won’t.

The booth hasn’t emailed me. The pay hasn’t hit. The mall hasn’t made a sound.

Maybe that was my last shift.

Maybe the mall finally let me go.

But here’s the thing.

I just went to the bathroom. Turned on the light.

My reflection was **already there**, staring at me when I opened the door.  
Standing still. Smiling.  
A long, curved shard of **mirror glass** tucked behind its back.

I blinked.

It didn’t.

**I don’t think I ever left the mall.**

And **I don’t think I’m the one who came home.**

Some background: I came from a really poor and abusive family, was valedictorian of HS, and got a full ride through college. I was able to escape my home life but in the process lost all contact with my family. College quite honestly was the best time of my life: lots of friends, purpose, motivation, and being away from all my life was. Nearing the end of undergrad I met a girl who I fell madly in love with. We did everything together and eventually moved into an apartment and got a cat. I then went through grad school where I began having severe bouts of depression and anxiety. My gf at the time supported me through it all but I became very reserved and distant. I also had mood swings as I was trialing different meds. I did end up making it through grad school and got a job. Things felt better once I got the job and I had hope again, but one day was blindsided when my gf wanted to leave. She said she wanted to work on herself and felt we have grown apart. I gave her space but also tried super hard to rekindle the relationship. Ultimately, she left, took all her things and the cat, and blocked me on everything. I thought things would get better and I have tried my hardest at getting past this but I cant and Im giving up hope. It’s been two years and all I can do is reminisce on the good times. I currently have no friends, no family, and no partner. I have some work friends but they really don’t go out or talk much. I am now so lonely: I sit in my apartment in silence, pace back and forth, drive and buy Starbucks coffee which I end up throwing away because I have no appetite. I just buy the coffee to do something. I have tried to go outside a lot or go to random events hoping to find someone but it doesn’t ever happen. I feel like Im losing all my years just rotting in this house and I keep getting worse mentally every day. I have tried distracting myself by going to amusement parks, tourist attractions, traveling, buying expensive things, watching all the tv shows i enjoy, but I am now running out of distractions. I have inevitably invested my whole life into work because Im scared to come home because I don’t want to ruminate on this stuff. I just feel there is no point moving forward and I should give up here. I am grateful for everything I do have: Im fit, have a six figure job, three degrees, multiple awards, and can buy whatever I want. Yet, I feel so damn empty and hopeless. I would burn all my degrees/awards and rip my money to shreds if I could just be fucking happy… This breakup has really destroyed me and I don’t know what to do but post here. Sorry for the rant.

(also sorry if some parts dont make sense, this is literary the first thing im doing right after waking up from MSI xdd)

Anyway, LR has been a proven success for the NLC popularity. But now, LR (and overall NLC) is just too dominant, both gameplay wise and popularity wise. It feels like unless LR is against Nord or in the EU masters final theyre just unbeatable. 

From MY OPINION, I think co-stream ERLs would help. Would get more people to watch their local ERLs (Hitpoint, ROL, Rift legends...) and some more high elo players into their domestic ERL scene. That in return could make some games not look like 5 chal vs 5 emeralds, which I think would make it not only more interesting but actually possible for some team to get major sponsors and become pro teams. Yes that sounds a bit like a fantasy but I THINK (again think, I am not a pro in this topic) it is a more than possible outcome.

Getting the rights to co-stream should be easy. As all honesty Caedrel co-streaming would be a huge thing for the ERLs and getting contact for the leagues would be easy and could get them from like scrim partners of NBS. FMS ect.. 

If all that could happen it could be possible for eu masters to become a promotion series to the LEC but that heavy fantasy sadly.

Petite incursion dans votre fil d'actualité de la part d'un artisan torréfacteur (Virtus Coffee Roaster : www.virtuscafe.fr)

Quand je torréfie mon café en atelier à Lille, mon objectif c'est de m'adapter aux grains de café que j'ai sourcé. Je cherche à réveler au maximum le potentiel du terroir, je passe du temps à chercher le profil de torréfaction parfait pour faire ressortir ce que le grain a de meilleur à offrir... Bref, je vais passer le jargon un peu technique haha !

Mais une question me fascine : le vocabulaire que j'utilise, c'est le mien, enfin pas juste le mien mais en tout cas on n'a pas tous le même. En tant que torréfacteur, j'utilise le jargon spécifique à ce milieu. En cupping, on utilisera les termes SCA pour décrire nos ressentis. Mais au quotidien, toi, consommateur de café, quels sont les premiers mots qui te viennent ?

J'aimerais beaucoup savoir comment vous, vous parlez d'un café qui vous plaît vraiment. Quand vous prenez votre tasse, quels sont les mots ou les sensations qui vous viennent ?

Est-ce que c'est une sensation ? (ex: ""un café réconfortant"", ""un coup de fouet"", etc...)

Un goût qui vous rappelle quelque chose ? (ex: ""ça a un petit goût de chocolat noir"", ""ça me rappelle telle ou telle chose"")

Une texture ? (ex: ""il est velouté"", ""plutôt léger"")

Je suis convaincu que les mots les plus justes ne sont pas toujours les plus techniques. J'ai envie de comprendre ce que vous ressentez, pour toujours mieux vous correspondre au quotidien.

Merci d'avance pour votre participation et n'hesitez pas à découvrir ce qu'on sait faire en terme de café de spécialité dans le Nord-Pas-de-Calais =D !

You know the drill , hoodie, pajama bottoms, questionable hygiene, but I keep it professional *from the waist up*. One Monday morning, I joined our team’s weekly Zoom meeting half-asleep, coffee still brewing, hoping to just coast through with my mic muted and camera off.

Except, SURPRISE , our manager had a “fun idea” and made it mandatory to turn cameras **on** because “face time builds connection.” I panicked. I clicked ""Start Video"" without checking anything.

Boom. My face pops up. But not **my** face. A **potato**. A literal potato head with big bug eyes and a creepy smile.

I forgot that the night before, my niece had used my laptop to Zoom her friends and activated a stupid potato filter. And I couldn't turn it off. Every time I spoke, the potato lips moved. My boss tried to act normal, but I saw her soul leave her body for a second.

I started fumbling with settings, accidentally changed it to a **cat**, then a **baby with sunglasses**, and finally froze on some alien with galaxy eyes. At that point, it looked like I was tripping balls in front of a Fortune 500 company.

Everyone laughed. I died inside. HR messaged me afterward asking if “everything was okay at home.”

So yeah. Always check your Zoom filters before meetings. Or just commit to the bit and become the office potato forever. Honestly, I kinda miss him.

This 12-cup programmable coffee maker has quite a modern vibe with its sleek, curved design and black finish. It fits snugly on the kitchen counter without taking up unnecessary space, which is a win in my book. The programmable feature itself feels like a coffee lover's dream come true, especially for someone who drags themselves to the kitchen in the mornings, desperate for caffeine. While the coffee taste was consistently good, a few quirks caught my attention, which I’ll break down here.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The contemporary style of this machine is truly eye-catching. Its relatively compact dimensions of 7.75 inches deep, 10.5 inches wide, and 14.5 inches tall make it an ideal fit for smaller kitchens or for those who, like me, dislike counters that feel cluttered. The ergonomic carafe is another thoughtful design element. It’s super easy to hold and pour coffee from without spilling, something I’ve struggled with in older coffee makers. Adding to its appeal is the stylish LCD clock that blends function with flair. It’s a coffee machine, sure, but it doesn’t scream “kitchen appliance” at you in its design.

**Programmable Convenience**

I can’t get over how life-changing the 24-hour advance programming is. Setting the timer before bed and waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee makes mornings feel less like a battle. With the hustle of work and pre-school drop-offs, this convenience is a game-changer. It even includes a ""Keep Warm"" function, holding your coffee at the perfect temperature for up to two hours. The automatic shutoff feature is customizable, too, so I didn’t have to worry about leaving the house with it running—a small but crucial touch.

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1500TG price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0947bfpdx/)

**Performance and Brewing Capability**

Brewing up to 12 cups in a single go is no joke. It’s perfect for hosting friends or for those mornings when I need more than just one or two cups to straighten myself out. The coffee brews evenly and consistently, which some lower-end machines often fail to do. I also tested out its “Brew Pause” feature, and it works just as promised—you can sneak in a cup mid-brew without making a mess. There’s a certain charm in not having to wait for the entire pot to finish brewing when you’re half-asleep.

**Positives**

- 24-hour programmable functionality is a major convenience.
- Brew Pause feature allows for mid-cycle pouring without spillage.
- Compact design fits well even in smaller kitchens.  
- Warm feature prevents coffee from going cold for up to two hours.
- Easy-to-use LCD for setting clocks and timers.

**Negatives**

- Cleaning alerts pop up often, which can feel slightly annoying.
- The reusable nylon filter sometimes traps a bit of residue.
- A three-year warranty is nice, but it doesn’t scream long-term durability.
  
**Cleaning and Maintenance Challenges**

Maintenance seemed straightforward at first glance, with the reusable nylon coffee filter reducing waste and saving money on disposable ones. However, the built-in cleaning indicator lights up more often than I expected—it’s helpful, sure, but also a bit nagging when I felt the machine was still doing fine. Cleaning itself involves the descaling process, which the LED alert guides you through efficiently. The coffee maker gets a thumbs-up for user-friendliness, even if cleaning and upkeep feel slightly more frequent.

**Product Rivals**

One competitor that springs to mind is the Ninja CE251 Programmable Coffee Maker, which also offers a 24-hour delay brew and a similar 12-cup capacity. While the Ninja has a slick interface, I feel the aesthetics of the Cuisinart machine pull ahead—it looks more inviting in a modern kitchen setup. On taste, both perform similarly, although the Ninja has the edge with its ability to control the brew strength. On durability, I’ve noticed other users mentioning that the Ninja might last a year longer with heavier daily use, so it might have a slight upper hand there.

Another notable rival is the Breville Precision Brewer Thermal. While Breville wins by offering more advanced controls, like six brewing modes, it comes at a higher price point. If you’re someone who loves experimenting with coffee strengths, Breville might tempt you, but for daily reliability without overcomplicating things, the Cuisinart holds its ground.

**True Value**

In terms of what you’re paying for, the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG delivers a solid bang for your buck. The programmable features are usually seen in machines at higher price points, so it feels like a great deal for what it offers. If you value consistency, ease of use, and a touch of luxury with that programmable timer and Brew Pause feature, you’ll find this coffee maker worth the investment. Of course, the additional effort in cleaning might deter some, but it could be a small trade-off given its reliability.

Love is like a cigarette. You light it, you smoke it but then what? What do you do with the butt? Correct. You throw it away.

Loyalty is the addiction you get.  
It doesn’t matter how much you despise yourself for smoking again you’ll still buy the pack. You need it to function. It becomes part of you.

Yes, I want the people around me not to love me I want them addicted to me.  
The reason is simple:  
I’m not someone you can throw away. I’m the addiction you can’t beat.

I dated a girl whose body would make you fall to your knees and pray again. Her skin was like marble. Her voice angelic, even when she talked dirty.  
The kind of woman men build empires for—and burn them down afterward.  
The ultimate prize in my collection.

She was perfect.  
At least that’s what I thought.  
Until she stopped smoking.

We shared a passion for art.  
I was a consumer. She was a creator.

That’s how we met. A friend we both knew invited me to an art gallery. His collection was being presented. Nothing special but out of good will, I blessed him with my appearance.

That’s when I saw her.  
Sitting on a bench, talking to nobody.

It didn’t take long for our worlds to collide.

From that moment on, we started to see each other regularly.

Everything was perfect.

After five months, I moved into her apartment. I watched her for hours working on her craft. Her best piece was even dedicated to me. I was her inspiration. She was my passion.

Slowly, other people started to notice her talent something I had recognized before anyone else.

She began selling more and more of her drawings.  
She got invited to galleries.  
Asked to paint murals in the most hyped-up bars in the city.  
She even won a few awards.

That was when we started to drift apart.

At one of the award shows, she gave a speech. Not even a single line about her partner.  
She won that award for a painting inspired by me.

She mentioned her family, her friends, the people she had worked with in the past—  
But not a single word about me.

I could feel her slipping out of my hands.

After that night, my feelings turned cold.  
She asked if something was wrong.  
I always said everything was fine.

She started spending most of her time in the studio. I couldn’t even watch her anymore.  
I felt like a dog left at home while the owner is out working.  
I couldn’t handle it.

Whenever we spent time together, she only talked about herself. How happy she was with her career.  
That was our first big fight.

I took it as a provocation.  
She knew exactly how much I struggled with my own work.  
I was on a break trying to find myself but that’s not the point.  
I knew she said it on purpose.  
She denied it, of course.

I grew sick of her arrogance.  
She made me feel like filth.  
Like a half-burned cigarette you throw away.

I had to do something.  
Not just for myself  
For us.

It was my job to fix her.  
So I did.

It was simple.

She needed to understand she could lose me—lose her inspiration.  
I didn’t do anything bad. Just a little reminder that I could be with anyone I wanted.

I went out for coffee with one of her artist friends. I didn’t even bother to remember her name. I paid for the drinks.  
And I stand by this: no cheating man pays with his own wallet.

She got hysterical.  
Accused me of cheating.

How could she call a man like me a cheater?  
She was the one cheating on us with her career.

I packed my bags.  
But I couldn’t just leave like that.

I stole one of her canvases. The one she was working on using my inspiration—my essence—for her stupid little drawings.

Recently, she gave an interview in some no-name paper.  
Talking about “toxic relationships.”

Of course she was talking about me.

But I know the truth.

You still need me, Clara.  
You’ll never get rid of me.

1lqmcyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1lqmcyg/question_for_the_ladies_here_who_dont_drive/,Question for the ladies here who don't drive (though all perspectives are welcome!),"Hiya! So, I recently picked up a second job which is less than a mile away from my apartment. The business is very small and is independently owned by a very nice, well-meaning woman who I work directly with on a day to day basis. She drives, I do not (because fuck cars, not that I would get into that topic with her lol). I have a main job I work longer hours at and make more money at, but it is 11 miles away. I take the bus and walk or ride my bike between stops to get there most days, but Sundays I hike or cycle to work since the bus starts later on Sundays and my work starts earlier on Sundays.  

  I look forward to this adventure every week and am perfectly content just being in nature for a while in the early early morning while everyone else is asleep - I drink my coffee, listen to my MP3 player, or sometimes just to the birds chirping, watch the sun fully rise, and I think it's a nice little ritual I have for right now. I have to leave my apartment at about 3:30 AM to get to work by 7 AM if I am hiking. Despite the relative time suck, I prefer hiking over cycling. I'm training to hike the AT so I see it as getting some miles in while commuting at the same time, a win-win!  

  However, my new boss and her daughter (a few years younger than me, but also a grown, independent woman) seem to see this as unbelievably dangerous, and cannot believe that ""as a girl"" I am doing this regularly. The topic came up because my boss told me that I should not walk home from her store alone at night even though it's less than a mile, since it's ""a bad neighborhood"" (it's my neighborhood but I don't think she meant offense 😂). I laughed and explained to her just how much walking I do alone in the dark as it is, and how I've never felt unsafe doing this, and nothing bad has ever happened. When I had to be at work at 5 AM in the winter I was hiking 6 miles from my old apartment (same city though) alone in the dark every day, and nothing bad ever happened then, either. She and her daughter think I'm nuts and are very worried for my safety, and believe if I am insistent on continuing to do this, I should arm myself.  

  So, my question is: have you noticed as a woman that people tend to be melodramatic about the ""dangers"" of walking alone as a woman?  

  Or, alternatively: Do you believe there's any merit to this concern, and that I am being naive in thinking they are being dramatic? As a woman, do you arm yourself when walking alone in the dark? I have lived in far larger cities with far higher violent crime rates, but they have lived in this city longer than I have and seen to think it's very dangerous. Should I arm myself?  

  Would you dismiss this concern as carbrain? Open to all perspectives!",32,1751539253.0,fuckcars,30,0.92,False

1lqma8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overcome_PE/comments/1lqma8b/can_drinking_more_water_help_you_last_longer_in/,Can Drinking More Water Help You Last Longer in Bed?,"Most PE advice focuses on edging, sprays, or mental tricks, but here’s a simple, overlooked factor: **hydration.**

You might not realize it, but being even a little dehydrated can affect your stamina in bed. Here’s why staying hydrated could help with premature ejaculation.

**How Dehydration Impacts Your Body During Sex**

When you’re dehydrated, your **heart rate increases, your blood pressure can rise, and your muscles may feel tense.** You’re also more likely to feel irritable or anxious, which can trigger faster arousal spikes and reduce your ability to manage them.

Dehydration can also lead to **reduced blood flow**, which impacts erection quality and consistency, making it harder to focus on pacing when you’re worried about maintaining your erection.

All of this can combine to make you feel more “on edge” during sex, making it harder to last.

**Hydration and Nerve Sensitivity**

Water helps keep your nervous system functioning smoothly. If you’re dehydrated, your nerve endings may become more sensitive, increasing the intensity of sensations during sex. This can push you closer to the edge faster than you’d like.

**A User’s Experience**

One user shared that on days he drank too much coffee and forgot to hydrate, he noticed he felt twitchy and tense during sex, leading to quick ejaculation. When he started making sure he drank enough water throughout the day, he felt calmer and found it easier to control his arousal during penetration.

**What You Can Try**

* **Drink water throughout the day** rather than chugging it all at once before sex.
* **Watch your caffeine and alcohol intake,** as these can dehydrate you.
* Aim for **clear or light-yellow urine** as a sign of good hydration.
* Consider drinking a glass of water 30–60 minutes before sex to ensure hydration without discomfort.

**Final Thought**

Hydration won’t magically fix PE, but it can support your body’s ability to stay calm and maintain blood flow during sex. Combined with your other control practices, staying hydrated could give you a small but noticeable edge in lasting longer.

Pic 2 - Loved all of the Body Scubs and butters. With the exception of the Coffee and Coco body scrub. It’s a loose scrub so it got all the shower every time I used it. I prefer to use a scrub with oil or cream. Bath bombs had no scent at all. The baby lotion smelled god awful like a dirty diaper, it was tossed immediately. 

Pic 3 - Skin care products were good for the most part. I really wanted to like the Ice by Sunday Riley but it was just way too thick feeling on my skin. The Eyeco mascara would flake off a lot throughout the day 

Pic 4 - Everything was good would purchase again. 

Feel free to ask any questions if you’d like more details ☺️

1lqm4ck,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqm4ck,My Favourite Choc Chip Cookie Recipe,"This is a recipe I arrived at after many many batches of experimenting and wondering what would happen if I added this or that to my choc chip cookies. A lot of choc chip cookie recipes were coming out over the last few years that used browned butter, so I wanted to try adding milk powder to my browned butter to make it even browned buttery-er. And I'm a fan of Christina Tosi's ""Compost Cookies"" which uses coffee grounds, so I added some of those as well, and loved the result. A lot of her cookie recipes also use glucose, so I added a bit of that too. I don't remember what made me think of using liquid smoke back when I was developing this recipe, but I do like the subtle savoury note it adds (it definitely doesn't taste noticeably smoky). You can leave the liquid smoke out if you want, I know it's a bit of a weird idea, but do try it at least once!
