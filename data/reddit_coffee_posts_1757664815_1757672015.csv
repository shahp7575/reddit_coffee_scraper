1nez7in,https://i.redd.it/mdrk0dyyjpof1.jpeg,How to teach my border collie puppy patience ? He whines A LOT,"Hello everyone,

I have handsome 6 month old border collie who is extremely sweet, affectionate, and energetic!

He listens pretty well and is off leash on all parks (et collar trained). His only real problem right now is that he is incredibly impatient. If I make him sit and wait while I talk to someone or pick up his üí©, he will start whining. If we're at someone's house and after 30 minutes the other dog is tired and wants to lie down, he whines to play. When there is someone coming to the house while he is in the crate, he whines because he wants to say hello. 

How do I teach him patience ? I want to be able to go to others' house or coffee shop with him without having to tend to him all the time. To clarify I don't give him attention if he whines or I scold him instead. 

Any tips please? ",2,1757671565.0,OpenDogTraining,1,1.0,False

1nez4hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1nez4hu/ever_been_routed_onto_a_highway_by_google_maps_on/,Ever been routed onto a highway by Google Maps on your scooter?,"Hey fellow scooter enthusiasts! 

I want to talk about something we‚Äôve all experienced: that awkward moment when your navigation app routes you onto a highway or a busy road meant for cars. It happened to me a while back when I was trying to find my way around the city. I ended up on a stretch of road that felt more suited for a motorcycle gang than my trusty scooter. It got me thinking about how flawed our current navigation tools can be, especially for riders like us who just want to enjoy the ride safely.

I decided to build something better, so I created Urban Rider, an iOS navigation app designed specifically for low-speed vehicles. Frustrated by the way standard apps handle scooter routing, I wanted to develop a tool that keeps us away from dangerous paths and prioritizes safe, scooter-friendly streets. This is more than just another app; it‚Äôs a solution for riders who want to avoid heart-pounding routes and enjoy the ride.

The key feature I focused on is routing that avoids highways altogether. Urban Rider only suggests routes that are safe for scooters, minimizing risks and keeping you on city streets and bike lanes. There‚Äôs nothing worse than being stuck on a busy highway when all you want is a smooth ride to your next destination.

For instance, last week, I made use of Urban Rider while meeting a friend for coffee. The app helped me navigate through quieter streets and neighborhoods instead of sending me down the main roads that were packed with cars. It made the ride feel much more relaxed, and I even discovered some new spots along the way!

If you‚Äôre curious, you can check it out here: [Urban Rider on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scooter-navigation-urban-rider/id6746205274?l=en-GB). I‚Äôd love to hear your stories about tricky navigation experiences! Have you ever had to make a quick turn to avoid a highway?

I feel a very nice boost of energy when using buttered coffee. There's also a feeling of satiety that goes on for several hours. Olive oil has no such effect. Is it because of the different fat profile? Mostly saturated fat in butter vs mostly monounsaturated in olive oil? Or maybe hot vs cold?

I am in Greece so I drink mostly cold coffee throughout the year. I also have easy access to decent olive oil

Most of those looking are not asking for fancy places. They just want somewhere to sleep, get a bit of breakfast, and head out to the Cinque Terre without stress. That is the point.

La Spezia as a town makes sense for that. It is not inside the five villages, but it is close enough. Trains run in and out all day. Buses connect too. If you drive, parking is easier here than along the coast. And when the day ends, you come back and it feels quieter, calmer, less crowded. That is why a bed and breakfast here is often the choice.

https://preview.redd.it/d5b7gqyxhpof1.jpg?width=3872&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e147597c42b2d373952ce0bbc224d8c48de448b0

# What most people picture when they hear B and B La Spezia

Say B&B LA SPEZIA and most people imagine the same thing. A small house or building. A few rooms, not many. Breakfast that might be just coffee and bread, maybe fruit, sometimes more if the host feels like it.

The rooms are not luxury, but they are tidy. A window with some daylight. Clean bed sheets. Wi Fi strong enough to check train times or message family. Bathrooms vary. Some private, some shared.

And then there is the host. Often a family. Sometimes just one person. They might greet you with a smile, share which train is less busy, or suggest a trattoria for dinner. Those little chats, small as they are, become part of the memory.

# Why travelers keep booking this kind of stay

There are reasons why B&B LA SPEZIA stays popular:

* It usually costs less than staying in Cinque Terre itself.
* Breakfast is included. Saves time, saves money.
* The scale is smaller. Less noise, fewer guests, calmer nights.
* Locations are often within reach of the station or a bus stop.
* Some guests just like the human side of meeting hosts.

Not everyone looks for the same thing. Some care only about price. Others want calm. A few just enjoy the contact with locals. It shifts from guest to guest.

# B and B compared with Hotel La Spezia

Sometimes people wonder, should I pick a B&B LA SPEZIA or a HOTEL LA SPEZIA. Both give you a bed, yes, but the style is different.

Hotels run on structure. Check in and check out times. Cleaning schedules. Parking lots. Televisions in every room. Everything predictable, the same every day. For many, that is comforting.

Bed and breakfasts are smaller. No front desk, just the host giving you keys. Fewer rooms, so fewer guests around. Breakfast may feel homemade, sometimes very simple, but personal.

So it depends. If you want predictability, the hotel works. If you like something smaller and more homelike, the bed and breakfast might feel right.

# Albergo La Spezia and the old way of travel

In Italian, albergo means hotel. But ALBERGO LA SPEZIA reminds people of older times. Inns where you stopped for food and sleep. Nothing grand, just a place to rest.

That same idea is alive in many bed and breakfasts now. A B&B LA SPEZIA is not trying to impress with extras. It gives you a room, a meal in the morning, and some care from the host. That is close to what an old albergo was about. Simple travel, human travel.

https://preview.redd.it/5w7wv1lohpof1.jpg?width=906&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18167dbdab1ae624acba98ac237eaf798b18014a

# Why La Spezia works well as a base

The Cinque Terre villages are the star of this region. Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, Riomaggiore. People come for them. But staying inside them is tricky. Prices are high, space is tight, and crowds are heavy.

A B&B LA SPEZIA lets you avoid that. From La Spezia station, trains take you to the villages in minutes. If you drive, roads and parking are easier here. At night you come back, rest, and the crowd is gone. You get the best of both‚Äîclose but not too close.

# A morning inside a B and B

Picture this. You wake up in a B&B LA SPEZIA. You walk down to a small dining room. Coffee, bread, maybe some pastries. The host says hello. You sit, eat, plan your day.

It feels different from a hotel buffet. No long line. No noise. Just a table, a simple meal, and a slow start. After that you go to the station, catch a train, and the day begins.

# The rooms and what they are like

Rooms are plain. They should be. People book them for sleep, not for show.

* Bed with clean sheets.
* Window with some daylight.
* Wi Fi that works well enough.
* Bathroom, private or shared.
* Quiet space at the end of the day.

That is what most guests want. Somewhere that does its job, nothing more.

# Who finds this type of stay useful

Different travelers find different value:

* Couples like the quiet and privacy.
* Solo travelers like the lower cost and the small talk with hosts.
* Families like the homelike setting where children feel comfortable.
* Drivers want easier parking away from the coast.
* Train travelers want walking distance to the station.

So a B&B LA SPEZIA works for a wide mix of people.

https://preview.redd.it/5esnnalphpof1.jpg?width=897&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2498201ce46a53a1bf1219013b95a58bf1d7771a

# Why location matters so much

Location can change the whole trip. Some bed and breakfasts are near the station. Perfect if you take the train every day. Others are in the countryside, where nights are calm and views open up.

Think about your plan. If Cinque Terre every day is your goal, being near the station makes sense. If you also want Tuscany or other towns, being close to the motorway helps. A B&B LA SPEZIA in the right spot saves hours.

# Evenings back in La Spezia

After walking trails and busy villages, evenings here feel different. You return to the bed and breakfast. Maybe you stop at a shop, grab some food, or try a small restaurant. Then you head back, rest, and the night is quiet.

That rhythm‚Äîbusy day, calm night‚Äîis what many people want.

# A slower style of travel

Without trying, many bed and breakfasts support slower travel. Smaller places use less. Guests walk more, ride buses, or take trains instead of driving. Staying outside the villages reduces pressure on them.

It is a lighter way of moving. Some guests notice it. Some just feel it without saying.

# Booking tips

Because most B&B LA SPEZIA places are small, with only a few rooms, booking early is smart. Especially in summer. Guests usually check:

* Is the bathroom private or shared
* What kind of breakfast is served
* Parking or no parking
* Distance to the station or buses

Asking the host a few questions before arrival makes things smoother.

# Final thoughts on B and B La Spezia

Picking where to stay matters. A B&B LA SPEZIA gives you a small, calm base. Rooms are plain but clean. Breakfast is ready. Hosts add a personal touch.

Compared with a HOTEL LA SPEZIA, it is less structured but more homelike. At the same time, it connects to the older spirit of ALBERGO LA SPEZIA, where lodging and meals were given with care.

For couples, solo visitors, or families who want Cinque Terre close but not inside the crowds, a bed and breakfast in La Spezia works. Simple, human, and enough.",1,1757670909.0,u_lapergolalaspeziait,0,1.0,False

He was very smooth, and I had zero experience in that area, so I didn‚Äôt understand we were flirting until others started joking about us. I told him not to compliment me around other people because they might misunderstand; he took that seriously, and we didn‚Äôt talk much when others were around.

He would always ask me out and find ways to say things like, ‚ÄúLet me get you a coffee after work,‚Äù but I always declined. I didn‚Äôt want to make things official, yet I also didn‚Äôt want anything to be awkward during my internship, so I kept turning him down politely.

When my internship ended, he acted very cold on my last day. That made me sad ‚Äî it was my final day and I was already upset, and his behavior made me feel like an extra. I didn‚Äôt say goodbye to most people and left immediately; that was rude. I‚Äôm planning to visit again to say goodbye to the others.

The problem is, he asked me out again to make up for that day and texted something like, ‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt talk to you when others are around, so we can be more free at a caf√©.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to‚Äîthere‚Äôs no need.‚Äù He probably didn‚Äôt take me seriously.

He‚Äôs really cute and knows how to make me blush, but he follows a lot of girls on Instagram ‚Äî a few of them look like they might have OF accounts. That bothers me.

1neywfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1neywfl/struggling_massively_with_my_3_year_old/,Struggling massively with my 3 year old,"I have a wonderful, kind, funny and smart 3 year old girl. She's my only child and I love her so much.

But my mental health has taken a dive lately. I can't seem to make her happy. Or at least I keep making her UNhappy. For example, we love gardening, we did gardening and were having a lovely bonding time and then she picked up a trowel and bashed it against a glass top outdoor coffee table. I calmly said stop that, it will break. She bashes it again, I say stop or I take it away. She bashes it again, I take the trowel away, she screams bloody murder for every neighbour to hear, insists she never wants to play with me again , and runs into the house. It's the same formula every time we're doing something nice : we sit and read books together which she loves, and halfway through she wants to rip through the pages. I ask her once, twice, and on the third ask to stop I take the book away, and a meltdown ensues. 

Her dad and I work full time, I do condensed hours so one day a week I don't work and have the day with her because we can't afford nursery (now pre school) fees five days a week. And I try to do things she enjoys, I ask her what she wants to do or I say we are going to do X thing today, and it seems several times a day I do something wrong and she loses her shit at me. And ever since she was born I swear she's had the loudest cry, louder than any kid I've ever met. As soon as the surgeon pulled her out of me she was screaming and even the midwives were chuckling and saying she has a set of lungs, she'll have no problem letting you know when she's unhappy ! And I remember when she was a few months old I went to a baby group, my girl was sitting quietly and then out of nowhere started WAILING like an ambulance siren because she was hungry. But she never showed hunger ques, no hand biting or anything, and on this occasion I offered her the bottle and she clamped her mouth shut and turned away so I didn't feed her, and then seconds later she made all the other mums and babies jump because she started screaming so loud. I don't compare her to others but she has a cousin the same age and his cry is a really gentle titter, and she has a friend the same age who cries really quietly. And this is something else I'm struggling with because when she cries she WAILS. And it'll be over the smallest thing, mum can I have a sweet? I say no, after lunch, WAAAAAAILLLLLLLLLLLLLL THATS NOT FAAAAAAIRRR I DONT WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND

And it's almost every inconvenience that she reacts like this. This morning she bumped her knee and she cried so loud and I was desperate so I said shh if you stop crying I'll give you a sweet. And it was a terrible tactic but she'd been wailing on and off all morning and I was just desperate for it to stop.

I've been dreading my days off alone with her. I used to love our mummy / daughter fridays and now I dread them because I just can't make her happy. Or I'll make her happy, we do everything she wants to do, I spend quality time with her, we go out and about, and then I'll tell her to stop doing something like standing on the bus seat and I've gone and ruined her afternoon 

I know this is toddler life but when does it get better ? I've been crying almost every day. Today I cried because I was stupid enough to suggest we set up this princess tent house she has, but of course we lost the instructions so I tried my best to build it, got it wrong so the tent wouldn't fit the frame, and suggested we throw blankets over the frame instead. This prompted a very loud meltdown, she screamed and cried that she didn't want the blanket, she wanted the tent, so I said let's wait for daddy to get home because he's much better at this (true story). She went downstairs to cry and I stayed in her room and cried and dismantled the frame ... Only for her to come back upstairs and ask to have the blanket on the frame, and I explained calmly that she insisted she didn't want the frame and blanket combination so I put it away, which only made her cry louder.

I just don't know what to do. She is very much in an 'i only want daddy' phase and I'm convinced it's because I keep doing everything wrong. And my husband is a very good very involved dad, supports us financially and with housework and everything, he's the best, but lately I see them together and I feel like an outcast from my own family.",1,1757670429.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,1,1.0,False
1neyw9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1neyw9m/delve_into_whether_kleenex_facial_tissue_delivers/,Delve Into Whether Kleenex Facial Tissue Delivers Premium Comfort,"The Kimberly-Clark Professional 21270 is definitely a product I wouldn‚Äôt have typically thought much about‚Äîafter all, it's facial tissue, right? But after using this bulk package in my office over the past few weeks, I have to admit there‚Äôs a certain luxurious charm about it. Believe me when I say these tissues aren't just your run-of-the-mill tissues. Designed with businesses in mind, they have qualities that make them stand apart. I‚Äôve been grabbing these for everything from sneezing to wiping my coffee spills off my desk, and here's my experience broken down across various aspects that truly matter.

**Design and Packaging that Matter**  
Let‚Äôs talk about first impressions. The cube box design caught my eye immediately. It‚Äôs sleek, doesn't take up much desk space, and better yet, fits comfortably in tight spots like bathroom counters or kitchen corners. Function aside, it's great for keeping things tidy because it doesn‚Äôt dominate the room decor-wise. In addition, the upright dispensing mechanism? Absolute genius. I have no patience for fiddling with boxes that tear apart when I yank tissues out, and thankfully, this one stood its ground even during my rush moments. 

**Softness Meets Strength**  
These tissues strike an impressive balance between being ultra-soft and actually strong enough to get the job done. Whether it‚Äôs wiping up minor spills or dabbing irritated skin during allergy season, the durability surprised me. You don‚Äôt experience that awful situation where the tissue disintegrates at the worst time. With two-ply layers, they're absorbent without feeling overly thick. One tissue often suffices for most uses, which means I'm not burning through an entire box in a week like I do with lesser brands.

**Perks**  
- The packaging incorporates Signal Sheets, where the last ten tissues are cream-colored instead of white. It‚Äôs such a thoughtful detail that prevents sudden tissue emergencies. 
- FSC certification? Yes, please! Knowing the materials support responsible forestry aligns with my eco-conscious efforts, making it a guilt-free purchase. 
- Each case contains 36 boxes, which means I won‚Äôt have to think about restocking for a long, long while unless my coworkers raid my stash.  

[Check Kimberly-Clark Professional 21270 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0040zoeyy/)

**Shortcomings**  
Of course, no product is flawless, and these tissues have a couple of quirks worth mentioning:  
- They aren‚Äôt the cheapest option available. Sure, the premium quality justifies the expense, but businesses trying to cut overheads might hesitate. 
- Because the tissues are white, any dirt or spill marks show immediately. In rare events requiring heavy cleanup, I occasionally find myself reaching for paper towels instead.  

**Performance in High-Traffic Areas**  
This product was clearly made with traffic in mind. I popped a few boxes into our office restrooms and waiting lounge, and they‚Äôve held up under continuous usage. Employees and clients alike have complimented the softness, which likely speaks to the level of care the brand invests in creating an elevated experience. Unlike some flimsy alternatives that people grab in bulk for workplaces, these 2-ply tissues actually stand up to frequent use. And because of the large number of boxes in a case, I can rest easy knowing spare stock won't run out anytime soon.

**Competitive Options**  
I must admit alternatives like Puffs Plus and Scott Comfort Plus come to mind when comparing products of this nature. While Puffs excels with its lotion-infused tissues that pamper particularly sensitive skin, they fall short in durability. Scott is undeniably cheaper, but the thin texture often fails to handle minor tasks beyond basic nose-blowing. Kimberly-Clark strikes a healthier balance of versatility and premium feel; it‚Äôs not extravagantly indulgent yet proves more reliable across all scenarios.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering the quantity (90 tissues per box, 36 boxes per pack), the product initially seemed a tad pricey. But breaking it down, the cost per unit feels reasonable given how well these tissues perform under diverse circumstances. Budget-conscious buyers might flinch at the upfront expense but trust me, this is one of those ‚Äúsave more in the long-term‚Äù types of deals. Less need for replacement and waste means you‚Äôre truly getting your value‚Äôs worth here.

1neyuxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1neyuxl/i_built_a_free_fretboard_training_tool_would_love/,"I built a free fretboard training tool, would love your feedback","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been learning bass myself and built a little web app to help me get better at finding notes on the fretboard. It‚Äôs still in very early stages, but I thought it might be useful for others too.

[lyafb.com](https://lyafb.com)

It runs in the browser and listens to your bass through your mic or interface. The idea is: it shows you random notes from a pool of your choosing on the fretboard, you play them, and it tells you if you hit the right ones. It also shows you statitics about your session like average response time, accuracy, most problematic notes etc. 

I‚Äôm **not a good bass player** (still learning), so testing with different skill levels and different basses would be super valuable for me. If you give it a try, I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback. Whether it works for you, what feels confusing, or what‚Äôs missing.

There‚Äôs no payment, no Patreon, nothing like that. There is a ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù link, but there is no perk you get by donating. It is 100% free.

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope it‚Äôs useful to some of you as well.",4,1757670281.0,Bass,0,1.0,False

1neys0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1neys0u/feeding_the_voices/,Feeding the Voices,"Pulling into the parking lot, I already know today was going to be a long day at work. With a sigh, I get out of the car and make my way to the custodial area of the university. The snow crunching underneath my feet, the clouds gathering into a sign of false promise of a peaceful night. The forecast said that tonight was going to be clear and cool. There‚Äôs a light dusting going on, the wind playing with the snow, dancing in small swirls. As quick as the dance commenced, it died just as fast. I‚Äôm breathing out smoke against the nip in the air. Keeping my fingers crossed that the weather doesn‚Äôt pick up.¬†



	Walking into the hospital, I stomp my feet to clear off any remaining snow on my shoes. Whomever laid down the ice melt went a little overboard. Either they weren‚Äôt paying attention, or they did it in a hurry. It‚Äôs not like we get reports of falls that often, but we do what we can to minimize them. But a clumsy person is a clumsy person. They‚Äôre gonna fall regardless of the weather. The night shift has its perks. You get to sleep in as late as you want, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the dumb morning shifters asking you idiotic questions, the facility is practically empty. You‚Äôd have to go out of your way to actually talk to someone.¬†



	After putting away my winter stuff in my locker, I walk out to the main space for the custodial department. It‚Äôs almost eleven-thirty, the second shifters should be coming in any minute. ‚ÄúJerry, can you come in here for a second?‚Äù Greg, my boss, called for me from the main office. Made my way over to see Greg and someone I haven‚Äôt met yet standing beside Greg. ‚ÄúJerry, this is our new employee, Veronica. Veronica, this is Jerry.‚Äù Veronica is pretty easy on the eyes. She‚Äôs barely five-feet tall against my six. Her blonde hair in a ponytail with two strands of hair framing her thin face. ‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù I said, holding out my hand. ‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù said Veronica, meeting my hand with a decent grip. I jokingly shake my hand away in mock pain, ‚ÄúWoah, woah, easy. Save your strength for the shift.‚Äù Veronica chortled, ‚ÄúWhatever, you just need to hit the gym more.‚Äù The two of us laughed a little, Greg wasn‚Äôt too thrilled; he was probably ready to call it a night. ‚ÄúJerry,‚Äù said Greg, a little too loudly, trying to get our attention, ‚Äúyou are going to take Veronica with you on your trash run. She has an idea of how the job works. I think it would do her good to see how to get around the hospital. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take the scenic routes and any short cuts you can think of that she could use in the future.‚Äù I nodded, then looked at Veronica, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind a little trash, do ya?‚Äù Veronica shook her head, ‚ÄúI used to work for a cleaning company that mainly focused on helping hoarders clean their living spaces. Apartments, to trailers and houses. I‚Äôve seen some horrors, trust me.‚Äù I believed her. Hoarding isn‚Äôt anything to scoff at. There have been a couple of family members who were hoarders. Only one was able to truly get a handle on things and got their place under control. The others became one with the waste they were collecting. Either by dying under a collapsed mound of heavy items, or falling asleep while cooking something in the kitchen with them burning alive in the house. You either remove the trash, or the trash removes you.



‚ÄúAnyway, the key box is open. You might have to wait for Charles to come in for the compactor key,‚Äù said Greg. ‚ÄúAs for me, I‚Äôm for this double shift to be over. I trust things will go well tonight.‚Äù Veronica looked at each other, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep him in line.‚Äù I chuckled, ‚ÄúOh okay, we‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù Greg shakes his head, ‚ÄúWith that, I‚Äôm going home before I call the house supervisor to see if I could pass out in a spare room.‚Äù Greg put on his coat, grabbed his bag, and he left the office. We followed behind him to head back into the main area. Charles walked in with the rest of the custodial crew. We were basically split into two different kinds of custodians, ones who specialize in cleaning the patient rooms, the ones who focus on different areas and offices of the hospital, and the trash people. Since its third shift, we didn‚Äôt need a lot of people on the floor. Maybe two custodians to flip rooms or touch up other parts of the hospital. It‚Äôs very rare for a patient to be discharged in the middle of the night.¬†



‚ÄúHey Charles, how did it go?‚Äù Charles gave me a look while he handed me the trash keys. ‚ÄúTonight was something, let me tell you,‚Äù Charles walks over to the counter where the sign in list is at. ‚ÄúThe first shift guy, Randal, I was told that he up and left in the middle of the shift. The last time someone saw the guy was around lunch break. He wasn‚Äôt even in any of his hiding places. The trash was starting to pile up and we had the trash keys with him. Thankfully, Greg was able to find the spare keys. DO NOT lose these. If you do, then all hell will break loose.‚Äù Greg goes into his locker, grabs his coat and winter garb, and starts putting them on. ‚ÄúThey actually had to get a hold of me to see if I wanted a little over time by coming in early. I mean, I‚Äôll never say no to extra money.‚Äù Greg laughs at this, I‚Äôm looking over the keys, double checking I had the ones I really needed. ‚ÄúCharles, where‚Äôs the key to big blue?‚Äù Charles starts patting his pockets until he finds the right pocket, reaches in, and pulls out a single key on its own key fob. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt think big blue needs, umm, any attention tonight,‚Äù says Charles is dodging eye contact with Veronica. ‚ÄúIf anything, maybe check on her after your dinner break. But I doubt she‚Äôll need anything.‚Äù Veronica looks at me, looking for the punch line, my stern face not backing down. ‚ÄúGuys, what is going on? What is ‚Äòbig blue;?‚Äù Charles laughs, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll find out soon enough.‚Äù Charles starts to head out of the custodial area with the rest of the second shifters. He stops, turns around and walks up to Veronica. ‚ÄúLittle advice?‚Äù Veronica nods. ‚ÄúWhatever you do‚Ä¶don‚Äôt pay any attention‚Ä¶to big blue. Ignore any whispers or voices you may hear. Just dump your waste, and walk away. Jerry will tell you more, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù Charles pats Veronica‚Äôs shoulder, then he made his way out.



The shift went by as well as it could. Veronica was a little confused and worried with what Charles told her. And I don‚Äôt blame her. It was very eerie to have someone telling you to ignore anything you may hear from something called ‚Äòbig blue‚Äô. I showed Veronica the ins and outs of the hospital in good time. But the main part he showed her was the main hallway that leads from the welcome area, down to the cafeteria and of course, to our area. It took Veronica a couple of passes of the hallway near our area to realise that the morgue was practically next door to our department. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶do we have to go in there to grab trash?‚Äù I looked at her to see Veronica standing in front of the door with some hesitation. ‚ÄúWhat? The morgue? Not every night. The person doing the trash run doesn‚Äôt have the key for that place. The mortician will contact someone on either first or second to let us know they have trash or biowaste to collect. The manager will then notify security, and an officer will meet up with us near the custodial department, and will escort us to go inside the morgue. It‚Äôs a whole process.‚Äù I went to push the trash cart down towards the compactor, but noticed Veronica still looking at the door to the morgue. After pushing the trash cart to one side of the hall, I walked towards Veronica, slowly put my hand on her shoulder, with Veronica gasping a little and jumped slightly. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Veronica laughed at herself, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs night time, there really isn‚Äôt anyone else around, and I have watched Romero movies far too many times. I guess I just spooked myself a little.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I reassured her, ‚Äúnothing is going to walk out of the morgue and eat you. All you gotta do on nights like this, is to keep busy. Then before you know it, you‚Äôll be on your way home. Okay?‚Äù Veronica nods her head, ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù We walked back to the trash cart, and made our way to the compactor.



‚ÄúHey, when are we going to see the infamous big blue?‚Äù asked Veronica. I pack up my Tupperware container back into my lunch bag and stand up. ‚ÄúWe can go now, if you want.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, okay, sure!‚Äù Veronica seemed excited. Everyone is excited to meet big blue. I remember when I was thrilled to see something new. Now? I wish to be doing something else. We walked up to where we parked the trash cart, Veronica was getting ready to push it, while I kept walking. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be needing that.‚Äù Confused, Veronica moved around the cart and caught up with me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve been paying attention to where we are right now. But it‚Äôs a little tricky to get to blue.‚Äù We entered the main machinery room, walked past the furnaces and ac units. It didn‚Äôt take long, but we made it to the very back of the room, to a hatch on the floor. Squatting down, I start opening the hatch to reveal a ladder leading down. ‚ÄúWant to go down first?‚Äù I asked, jokingly. Veronica looks down and hesitates, ‚ÄúYou better go down first.‚Äù I shrug, and start making my way down. I called up to her to let her know that it‚Äôs safe to climb down, and she does.



Once Veronica is all the way down, she starts looking around, ‚ÄúWhere-‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in that room,‚Äù I interrupted her, already knowing what she was going to ask. I lead the way toward the only door in the room. After unlocking the door, Veronica moves toward the door, but I hold up a hand, ‚ÄúRemember what Charles told you: don‚Äôt pay attention to anything you may hear.

Understand?‚Äù Veronica, with trepidation in her face, nods. I fully open the door, and we walk in.



‚ÄúWhat? Are you kidding me? This is big blue!?‚Äù It was a big blue compactor that's connected to the wall. There‚Äôs a little walkway where you use the stairs to get up to the dumping area. To the side of the door, is the control panel for big blue that has only three buttons: Start, Emergency Stop, and Purge. ‚ÄúWhat kind of waste do you bring down‚Ä¶‚Äù Veronica stops to listen. A raspy voice cuts through the silence, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶meeeeee‚Äù the voice said. Veronica starts to slowly look around the room. ‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶did you hear,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt pay attention.

\--But Jerry couldn‚Äôt hear Veronica. Jerry‚Äôs eyes turned pitch black. For he understands. The ones lucky enough to meet me understand. Patients were complaining about hearing voices in their rooms. Whispers of broken promises, empty threats, deadly suggestions. The father and a handful of sisters searched the rooms, searched the offices, and finally, found me. They tried cleansing me, they tried blessing me. But sooner or later, they understand. The only way to calm me, to put me at ease‚Ä¶is to feed me. Veronica is shaking Jerry, shaking him, thinking that will get his attention. But he is mine. Jerry looks down at Veronica, grabs her head, and slams it into the metal railing. She collapses, blood streaming down her face. Her senses are blurred, and she is questioning what just happened. Jerry, not missing a stride, opens me up. He then picks up Veronica, and throws her into my hatch, my watering mouth. Jerry watches Veronica slightly move around inside, trying to figure out where she is, what she‚Äôs touching. Just as quickly as it started, my hold on Jerry lifts.--



‚ÄúJerry? What‚Ä¶what happened?‚Äù My vision clears, and I realize what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm standing in front of the hatch and I see Veronica in big blue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm, I‚Äôm sorry Veronica. But blue has to feed. It has to be you.‚Äù I look down in blue to see Andy, the first shift trash guy. I guess the first shift manager told Andy to go check on blue. Maybe the voices got to him, maybe she got hungry. I reached into his chest pocket, and luckily found the first set of trash keys.

Veronica has started to scream, pounding on the door. I push the start button, and big blue starts to compact. Sounds of Veronica fighting to stay near the hatch door, but big blue‚Äôs tongue is much stronger, pushing her towards the other side of blue. With the screams becoming more and more quiet, I closed and locked the door, made my way up the ladder, and closed the floor hatch.



‚ÄúJerry, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù Greg came walking in the main custodial area. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Veronica?‚Äù I took a sip of coffee, and gave him a solemn look, ‚ÄúBig blue got hungry.‚Äù Greg‚Äôs smile faded away.

1neyre3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1neyre3/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1neyqof,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1neyqof/feeding_the_voices/,Feeding the Voices,"Pulling into the parking lot, I already know today was going to be a long day at work. With a sigh, I get out of the car and make my way to the custodial area of the university. The snow crunching underneath my feet, the clouds gathering into a sign of false promise of a peaceful night. The forecast said that tonight was going to be clear and cool. There‚Äôs a light dusting going on, the wind playing with the snow, dancing in small swirls. As quick as the dance commenced, it died just as fast. I‚Äôm breathing out smoke against the nip in the air. Keeping my fingers crossed that the weather doesn‚Äôt pick up.¬†



	Walking into the hospital, I stomp my feet to clear off any remaining snow on my shoes. Whomever laid down the ice melt went a little overboard. Either they weren‚Äôt paying attention, or they did it in a hurry. It‚Äôs not like we get reports of falls that often, but we do what we can to minimize them. But a clumsy person is a clumsy person. They‚Äôre gonna fall regardless of the weather. The night shift has its perks. You get to sleep in as late as you want, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the dumb morning shifters asking you idiotic questions, the facility is practically empty. You‚Äôd have to go out of your way to actually talk to someone.¬†



	After putting away my winter stuff in my locker, I walk out to the main space for the custodial department. It‚Äôs almost eleven-thirty, the second shifters should be coming in any minute. ‚ÄúJerry, can you come in here for a second?‚Äù Greg, my boss, called for me from the main office. Made my way over to see Greg and someone I haven‚Äôt met yet standing beside Greg. ‚ÄúJerry, this is our new employee, Veronica. Veronica, this is Jerry.‚Äù Veronica is pretty easy on the eyes. She‚Äôs barely five-feet tall against my six. Her blonde hair in a ponytail with two strands of hair framing her thin face. ‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù I said, holding out my hand. ‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù said Veronica, meeting my hand with a decent grip. I jokingly shake my hand away in mock pain, ‚ÄúWoah, woah, easy. Save your strength for the shift.‚Äù Veronica chortled, ‚ÄúWhatever, you just need to hit the gym more.‚Äù The two of us laughed a little, Greg wasn‚Äôt too thrilled; he was probably ready to call it a night. ‚ÄúJerry,‚Äù said Greg, a little too loudly, trying to get our attention, ‚Äúyou are going to take Veronica with you on your trash run. She has an idea of how the job works. I think it would do her good to see how to get around the hospital. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take the scenic routes and any short cuts you can think of that she could use in the future.‚Äù I nodded, then looked at Veronica, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind a little trash, do ya?‚Äù Veronica shook her head, ‚ÄúI used to work for a cleaning company that mainly focused on helping hoarders clean their living spaces. Apartments, to trailers and houses. I‚Äôve seen some horrors, trust me.‚Äù I believed her. Hoarding isn‚Äôt anything to scoff at. There have been a couple of family members who were hoarders. Only one was able to truly get a handle on things and got their place under control. The others became one with the waste they were collecting. Either by dying under a collapsed mound of heavy items, or falling asleep while cooking something in the kitchen with them burning alive in the house. You either remove the trash, or the trash removes you.



‚ÄúAnyway, the key box is open. You might have to wait for Charles to come in for the compactor key,‚Äù said Greg. ‚ÄúAs for me, I‚Äôm for this double shift to be over. I trust things will go well tonight.‚Äù Veronica looked at each other, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep him in line.‚Äù I chuckled, ‚ÄúOh okay, we‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù Greg shakes his head, ‚ÄúWith that, I‚Äôm going home before I call the house supervisor to see if I could pass out in a spare room.‚Äù Greg put on his coat, grabbed his bag, and he left the office. We followed behind him to head back into the main area. Charles walked in with the rest of the custodial crew. We were basically split into two different kinds of custodians, ones who specialize in cleaning the patient rooms, the ones who focus on different areas and offices of the hospital, and the trash people. Since its third shift, we didn‚Äôt need a lot of people on the floor. Maybe two custodians to flip rooms or touch up other parts of the hospital. It‚Äôs very rare for a patient to be discharged in the middle of the night.¬†



‚ÄúHey Charles, how did it go?‚Äù Charles gave me a look while he handed me the trash keys. ‚ÄúTonight was something, let me tell you,‚Äù Charles walks over to the counter where the sign in list is at. ‚ÄúThe first shift guy, Randal, I was told that he up and left in the middle of the shift. The last time someone saw the guy was around lunch break. He wasn‚Äôt even in any of his hiding places. The trash was starting to pile up and we had the trash keys with him. Thankfully, Greg was able to find the spare keys. DO NOT lose these. If you do, then all hell will break loose.‚Äù Greg goes into his locker, grabs his coat and winter garb, and starts putting them on. ‚ÄúThey actually had to get a hold of me to see if I wanted a little over time by coming in early. I mean, I‚Äôll never say no to extra money.‚Äù Greg laughs at this, I‚Äôm looking over the keys, double checking I had the ones I really needed. ‚ÄúCharles, where‚Äôs the key to big blue?‚Äù Charles starts patting his pockets until he finds the right pocket, reaches in, and pulls out a single key on its own key fob. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt think big blue needs, umm, any attention tonight,‚Äù says Charles is dodging eye contact with Veronica. ‚ÄúIf anything, maybe check on her after your dinner break. But I doubt she‚Äôll need anything.‚Äù Veronica looks at me, looking for the punch line, my stern face not backing down. ‚ÄúGuys, what is going on? What is ‚Äòbig blue;?‚Äù Charles laughs, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll find out soon enough.‚Äù Charles starts to head out of the custodial area with the rest of the second shifters. He stops, turns around and walks up to Veronica. ‚ÄúLittle advice?‚Äù Veronica nods. ‚ÄúWhatever you do‚Ä¶don‚Äôt pay any attention‚Ä¶to big blue. Ignore any whispers or voices you may hear. Just dump your waste, and walk away. Jerry will tell you more, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù Charles pats Veronica‚Äôs shoulder, then he made his way out.



The shift went by as well as it could. Veronica was a little confused and worried with what Charles told her. And I don‚Äôt blame her. It was very eerie to have someone telling you to ignore anything you may hear from something called ‚Äòbig blue‚Äô. I showed Veronica the ins and outs of the hospital in good time. But the main part he showed her was the main hallway that leads from the welcome area, down to the cafeteria and of course, to our area. It took Veronica a couple of passes of the hallway near our area to realise that the morgue was practically next door to our department. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶do we have to go in there to grab trash?‚Äù I looked at her to see Veronica standing in front of the door with some hesitation. ‚ÄúWhat? The morgue? Not every night. The person doing the trash run doesn‚Äôt have the key for that place. The mortician will contact someone on either first or second to let us know they have trash or biowaste to collect. The manager will then notify security, and an officer will meet up with us near the custodial department, and will escort us to go inside the morgue. It‚Äôs a whole process.‚Äù I went to push the trash cart down towards the compactor, but noticed Veronica still looking at the door to the morgue. After pushing the trash cart to one side of the hall, I walked towards Veronica, slowly put my hand on her shoulder, with Veronica gasping a little and jumped slightly. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Veronica laughed at herself, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs night time, there really isn‚Äôt anyone else around, and I have watched Romero movies far too many times. I guess I just spooked myself a little.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I reassured her, ‚Äúnothing is going to walk out of the morgue and eat you. All you gotta do on nights like this, is to keep busy. Then before you know it, you‚Äôll be on your way home. Okay?‚Äù Veronica nods her head, ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù We walked back to the trash cart, and made our way to the compactor.



‚ÄúHey, when are we going to see the infamous big blue?‚Äù asked Veronica. I pack up my Tupperware container back into my lunch bag and stand up. ‚ÄúWe can go now, if you want.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, okay, sure!‚Äù Veronica seemed excited. Everyone is excited to meet big blue. I remember when I was thrilled to see something new. Now? I wish to be doing something else. We walked up to where we parked the trash cart, Veronica was getting ready to push it, while I kept walking. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be needing that.‚Äù Confused, Veronica moved around the cart and caught up with me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve been paying attention to where we are right now. But it‚Äôs a little tricky to get to blue.‚Äù We entered the main machinery room, walked past the furnaces and ac units. It didn‚Äôt take long, but we made it to the very back of the room, to a hatch on the floor. Squatting down, I start opening the hatch to reveal a ladder leading down. ‚ÄúWant to go down first?‚Äù I asked, jokingly. Veronica looks down and hesitates, ‚ÄúYou better go down first.‚Äù I shrug, and start making my way down. I called up to her to let her know that it‚Äôs safe to climb down, and she does.



Once Veronica is all the way down, she starts looking around, ‚ÄúWhere-‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in that room,‚Äù I interrupted her, already knowing what she was going to ask. I lead the way toward the only door in the room. After unlocking the door, Veronica moves toward the door, but I hold up a hand, ‚ÄúRemember what Charles told you: don‚Äôt pay attention to anything you may hear. You might hear screaming, crying, or someone asking for help. Don‚Äôt acknowledge them. Don‚Äôt pay attention to them. Just walk in, do your task, then leave as quickly as you can. Understand?‚Äù Veronica, with trepidation in her face, nods. I fully open the door, and we walk in.



‚ÄúWhat? Are you kidding me? This is big blue!?‚Äù It was a big blue compactor that's connected to the wall. There‚Äôs a little walkway where you use the stairs to get up to the dumping area. To the side of the door, is the control panel for big blue that has only three buttons: Start, Emergency Stop, and Purge. ‚ÄúWhat kind of waste do you bring down‚Ä¶‚Äù Veronica stops to listen. A raspy voice cuts through the silence, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶meeeeee‚Äù the voice said. Veronica starts to slowly look around the room. ‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶did you hear,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt pay attention. Look, here‚Äôs how you use blue,‚Äù I waved a hand towards the stairs leading to the hatch and the control panel. Veronica studies the panel, ‚ÄúPurge? What does that‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice echoes again, a little louder, the raspiness turned into almost a gargle, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶.meeeee,‚Äù another voice, a whisper, adds in, ‚ÄúHe pushed me‚Ä¶.he pushed me in here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you ignore this?‚Äù Sweat is starting to form on my face, I‚Äôm starting to rush through this part of the training, ‚ÄúYou open the hatch, put the waste in, close the hatch, and hit the start button.‚Äù ‚ÄúJerry?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you hear anything wrong while blue is compacting, you hit the emergency button, then report to the manager.‚Äù A scream from inside the compactor interrupts me, ‚ÄúHEEEEEEEEELP USSSSSS!!!! HE LEAD ME HERE, PUSHED ME IN, AND CRUSHED MEEEEEEEE!!!! I SCREEAMED AND SCREEEAMED, BUT NO ONE CAME!!!‚Äù Veronica is now shaking me, ‚ÄúJerry, we have to leave. We need to get out!!‚Äù

1neypqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1neypqh/feeding_the_voices/,Feeding the Voices,"Pulling into the parking lot, I already know today was going to be a long day at work. With a sigh, I get out of the car and make my way to the custodial area of the university. The snow crunching underneath my feet, the clouds gathering into a sign of false promise of a peaceful night. The forecast said that tonight was going to be clear and cool. There‚Äôs a light dusting going on, the wind playing with the snow, dancing in small swirls. As quick as the dance commenced, it died just as fast. I‚Äôm breathing out smoke against the nip in the air. Keeping my fingers crossed that the weather doesn‚Äôt pick up.¬†



	Walking into the hospital, I stomp my feet to clear off any remaining snow on my shoes. Whomever laid down the ice melt went a little overboard. Either they weren‚Äôt paying attention, or they did it in a hurry. It‚Äôs not like we get reports of falls that often, but we do what we can to minimize them. But a clumsy person is a clumsy person. They‚Äôre gonna fall regardless of the weather. The night shift has its perks. You get to sleep in as late as you want, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the dumb morning shifters asking you idiotic questions, the facility is practically empty. You‚Äôd have to go out of your way to actually talk to someone.¬†



	After putting away my winter stuff in my locker, I walk out to the main space for the custodial department. It‚Äôs almost eleven-thirty, the second shifters should be coming in any minute. ‚ÄúJerry, can you come in here for a second?‚Äù Greg, my boss, called for me from the main office. Made my way over to see Greg and someone I haven‚Äôt met yet standing beside Greg. ‚ÄúJerry, this is our new employee, Veronica. Veronica, this is Jerry.‚Äù Veronica is pretty easy on the eyes. She‚Äôs barely five-feet tall against my six. Her blonde hair in a ponytail with two strands of hair framing her thin face. ‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù I said, holding out my hand. ‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù said Veronica, meeting my hand with a decent grip. I jokingly shake my hand away in mock pain, ‚ÄúWoah, woah, easy. Save your strength for the shift.‚Äù Veronica chortled, ‚ÄúWhatever, you just need to hit the gym more.‚Äù The two of us laughed a little, Greg wasn‚Äôt too thrilled; he was probably ready to call it a night. ‚ÄúJerry,‚Äù said Greg, a little too loudly, trying to get our attention, ‚Äúyou are going to take Veronica with you on your trash run. She has an idea of how the job works. I think it would do her good to see how to get around the hospital. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take the scenic routes and any short cuts you can think of that she could use in the future.‚Äù I nodded, then looked at Veronica, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind a little trash, do ya?‚Äù Veronica shook her head, ‚ÄúI used to work for a cleaning company that mainly focused on helping hoarders clean their living spaces. Apartments, to trailers and houses. I‚Äôve seen some horrors, trust me.‚Äù I believed her. Hoarding isn‚Äôt anything to scoff at. There have been a couple of family members who were hoarders. Only one was able to truly get a handle on things and got their place under control. The others became one with the waste they were collecting. Either by dying under a collapsed mound of heavy items, or falling asleep while cooking something in the kitchen with them burning alive in the house. You either remove the trash, or the trash removes you.



‚ÄúAnyway, the key box is open. You might have to wait for Charles to come in for the compactor key,‚Äù said Greg. ‚ÄúAs for me, I‚Äôm for this double shift to be over. I trust things will go well tonight.‚Äù Veronica looked at each other, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep him in line.‚Äù I chuckled, ‚ÄúOh okay, we‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù Greg shakes his head, ‚ÄúWith that, I‚Äôm going home before I call the house supervisor to see if I could pass out in a spare room.‚Äù Greg put on his coat, grabbed his bag, and he left the office. We followed behind him to head back into the main area. Charles walked in with the rest of the custodial crew. We were basically split into two different kinds of custodians, ones who specialize in cleaning the patient rooms, the ones who focus on different areas and offices of the hospital, and the trash people. Since its third shift, we didn‚Äôt need a lot of people on the floor. Maybe two custodians to flip rooms or touch up other parts of the hospital. It‚Äôs very rare for a patient to be discharged in the middle of the night.¬†



‚ÄúHey Charles, how did it go?‚Äù Charles gave me a look while he handed me the trash keys. ‚ÄúTonight was something, let me tell you,‚Äù Charles walks over to the counter where the sign in list is at. ‚ÄúThe first shift guy, Randal, I was told that he up and left in the middle of the shift. The last time someone saw the guy was around lunch break. He wasn‚Äôt even in any of his hiding places. The trash was starting to pile up and we had the trash keys with him. Thankfully, Greg was able to find the spare keys. DO NOT lose these. If you do, then all hell will break loose.‚Äù Greg goes into his locker, grabs his coat and winter garb, and starts putting them on. ‚ÄúThey actually had to get a hold of me to see if I wanted a little over time by coming in early. I mean, I‚Äôll never say no to extra money.‚Äù Greg laughs at this, I‚Äôm looking over the keys, double checking I had the ones I really needed. ‚ÄúCharles, where‚Äôs the key to big blue?‚Äù Charles starts patting his pockets until he finds the right pocket, reaches in, and pulls out a single key on its own key fob. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt think big blue needs, umm, any attention tonight,‚Äù says Charles is dodging eye contact with Veronica. ‚ÄúIf anything, maybe check on her after your dinner break. But I doubt she‚Äôll need anything.‚Äù Veronica looks at me, looking for the punch line, my stern face not backing down. ‚ÄúGuys, what is going on? What is ‚Äòbig blue;?‚Äù Charles laughs, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll find out soon enough.‚Äù Charles starts to head out of the custodial area with the rest of the second shifters. He stops, turns around and walks up to Veronica. ‚ÄúLittle advice?‚Äù Veronica nods. ‚ÄúWhatever you do‚Ä¶don‚Äôt pay any attention‚Ä¶to big blue. Ignore any whispers or voices you may hear. Just dump your waste, and walk away. Jerry will tell you more, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù Charles pats Veronica‚Äôs shoulder, then he made his way out.



The shift went by as well as it could. Veronica was a little confused and worried with what Charles told her. And I don‚Äôt blame her. It was very eerie to have someone telling you to ignore anything you may hear from something called ‚Äòbig blue‚Äô. I showed Veronica the ins and outs of the hospital in good time. But the main part he showed her was the main hallway that leads from the welcome area, down to the cafeteria and of course, to our area. It took Veronica a couple of passes of the hallway near our area to realise that the morgue was practically next door to our department. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶do we have to go in there to grab trash?‚Äù I looked at her to see Veronica standing in front of the door with some hesitation. ‚ÄúWhat? The morgue? Not every night. The person doing the trash run doesn‚Äôt have the key for that place. The mortician will contact someone on either first or second to let us know they have trash or biowaste to collect. The manager will then notify security, and an officer will meet up with us near the custodial department, and will escort us to go inside the morgue. It‚Äôs a whole process.‚Äù I went to push the trash cart down towards the compactor, but noticed Veronica still looking at the door to the morgue. After pushing the trash cart to one side of the hall, I walked towards Veronica, slowly put my hand on her shoulder, with Veronica gasping a little and jumped slightly. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Veronica laughed at herself, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs night time, there really isn‚Äôt anyone else around, and I have watched Romero movies far too many times. I guess I just spooked myself a little.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I reassured her, ‚Äúnothing is going to walk out of the morgue and eat you. All you gotta do on nights like this, is to keep busy. Then before you know it, you‚Äôll be on your way home. Okay?‚Äù Veronica nods her head, ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù We walked back to the trash cart, and made our way to the compactor.



‚ÄúHey, when are we going to see the infamous big blue?‚Äù asked Veronica. I pack up my Tupperware container back into my lunch bag and stand up. ‚ÄúWe can go now, if you want.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, okay, sure!‚Äù Veronica seemed excited. Everyone is excited to meet big blue. I remember when I was thrilled to see something new. Now? I wish to be doing something else. We walked up to where we parked the trash cart, Veronica was getting ready to push it, while I kept walking. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be needing that.‚Äù Confused, Veronica moved around the cart and caught up with me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve been paying attention to where we are right now. But it‚Äôs a little tricky to get to blue.‚Äù We entered the main machinery room, walked past the furnaces and ac units. It didn‚Äôt take long, but we made it to the very back of the room, to a hatch on the floor. Squatting down, I start opening the hatch to reveal a ladder leading down. ‚ÄúWant to go down first?‚Äù I asked, jokingly. Veronica looks down and hesitates, ‚ÄúYou better go down first.‚Äù I shrug, and start making my way down. I called up to her to let her know that it‚Äôs safe to climb down, and she does.



Once Veronica is all the way down, she starts looking around, ‚ÄúWhere-‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in that room,‚Äù I interrupted her, already knowing what she was going to ask. I lead the way toward the only door in the room. After unlocking the door, Veronica moves toward the door, but I hold up a hand, ‚ÄúRemember what Charles told you: don‚Äôt pay attention to anything you may hear. You might hear screaming, crying, or someone asking for help. Don‚Äôt acknowledge them. Don‚Äôt pay attention to them. Just walk in, do your task, then leave as quickly as you can. Understand?‚Äù Veronica, with trepidation in her face, nods. I fully open the door, and we walk in.



‚ÄúWhat? Are you kidding me? This is big blue!?‚Äù It was a big blue compactor that's connected to the wall. There‚Äôs a little walkway where you use the stairs to get up to the dumping area. To the side of the door, is the control panel for big blue that has only three buttons: Start, Emergency Stop, and Purge. ‚ÄúWhat kind of waste do you bring down‚Ä¶‚Äù Veronica stops to listen. A raspy voice cuts through the silence, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶meeeeee‚Äù the voice said. Veronica starts to slowly look around the room. ‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶did you hear,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt pay attention. Look, here‚Äôs how you use blue,‚Äù I waved a hand towards the stairs leading to the hatch and the control panel. Veronica studies the panel, ‚ÄúPurge? What does that‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice echoes again, a little louder, the raspiness turned into almost a gargle, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶.meeeee,‚Äù another voice, a whisper, adds in, ‚ÄúHe pushed me‚Ä¶.he pushed me in here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you ignore this?‚Äù Sweat is starting to form on my face, I‚Äôm starting to rush through this part of the training, ‚ÄúYou open the hatch, put the waste in, close the hatch, and hit the start button.‚Äù ‚ÄúJerry?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you hear anything wrong while blue is compacting, you hit the emergency button, then report to the manager.‚Äù A scream from inside the compactor interrupts me, ‚ÄúHEEEEEEEEELP USSSSSS!!!! HE LEAD ME HERE, PUSHED ME IN, AND CRUSHED MEEEEEEEE!!!! I SCREEAMED AND SCREEEAMED, BUT NO ONE CAME!!!‚Äù Veronica is now shaking me, ‚ÄúJerry, we have to leave. We need to get out!!‚Äù



\--But Jerry couldn‚Äôt hear Veronica. Jerry‚Äôs eyes turned pitch black. For he understands. The ones lucky enough to meet me understand. Patients were complaining about hearing voices in their rooms. Whispers of broken promises, empty threats, deadly suggestions. The father and a handful of sisters searched the rooms, searched the offices, and finally, found me. They tried cleansing me, they tried blessing me. But sooner or later, they understand. The only way to calm me, to put me at ease‚Ä¶is to feed me. Veronica is shaking Jerry, shaking him, thinking that will get his attention. But he is mine. Jerry looks down at Veronica, grabs her head, and slams it into the metal railing. She collapses, blood streaming down her face. Her senses are blurred, and she is questioning what just happened. Jerry, not missing a stride, opens me up. He then picks up Veronica, and throws her into my hatch, my watering mouth. Jerry watches Veronica slightly move around inside, trying to figure out where she is, what she‚Äôs touching. Just as quickly as it started, my hold on Jerry lifts.--



‚ÄúJerry? What‚Ä¶what happened?‚Äù My vision clears, and I realize what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm standing in front of the hatch and I see Veronica in big blue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm, I‚Äôm sorry Veronica. But blue has to feed. It has to be you.‚Äù I look down in blue to see Andy, the first shift trash guy. I guess the first shift manager told Andy to go check on blue. Maybe the voices got to him, maybe she got hungry. I reached into his chest pocket, and luckily found the first set of trash keys. The raspy voice comes back, ‚ÄúWhhhhhhaaaat are you waaaaiting fooooor? Finnnnnnish the joooooo,‚Äù ‚ÄúJerry, Jerry don-‚Äù I slam the hatch, and slide the lock closed. Veronica has started to scream, pounding on the door. I push the start button, and big blue starts to compact. Sounds of Veronica fighting to stay near the hatch door, but big blue‚Äôs tongue is much stronger, pushing her towards the other side of blue. With the screams becoming more and more quiet, I closed and locked the door, made my way up the ladder, and closed the floor hatch.



‚ÄúJerry, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù Greg came walking in the main custodial area. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Veronica?‚Äù I took a sip of coffee, and gave him a solemn look, ‚ÄúBig blue got hungry.‚Äù Greg‚Äôs smile faded away. He then walks into the office, puts away his winter garb, and sits down near his desk, hands slide behind his head. ‚ÄúI found Andy.‚Äù Greg looks at me slightly surprised. I toss him Andy‚Äôs keys, ‚ÄúMight want to call Charles. Him and Blue, they have an understanding.‚Äù Greg nods his head, ‚ÄúAnd you? Why does Blue keep you around?‚Äù I put on my coat, ‚ÄúShe trusts me. Blue knows I can deliver.‚Äù I walk out of the office, and make my way out of the hospital. It‚Äôs not everyday that I see big blue. But the old girl still knows how to have a good time. I just hope she doesn‚Äôt have that kind of fun with me.¬†¬†",1,1757669742.0,creepypasta,0,0.99,False
1neypof,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_curatedwellness/comments/1neypof/9_effective_ways_to_lower_blood_pressure_naturally/,9 Effective Ways to Lower Blood Pressure Naturally,"# Get Creative About Managing¬†Stress

Stress doesn‚Äôt just mess with your mood; it directly impacts your blood pressure. A single stressful moment can spike your numbers. Long-term stress keeps them elevated.

To dial down stress:

* Say no when you need to
* Ask for help before burnout hits
* Write things out in a journal
* Get moving, even a 10-minute walk helps
* Declutter your space to declutter your mind
* Practice deep breathing
* Talk to a therapist if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed
* Spend time outdoors

Some people also turn to adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha, rhodiola, and tulsi. These herbs help your body stay calm under pressure by supporting cortisol balance and a more resilient nervous system.

# Use Turmeric to Support Your¬†Heart

[**Turmeric**](https://curatedwellness.com/collections/turmeric-curcumin?_pos=1&_psq=turmeric&_ss=e&_v=1.0) has been used for centuries in India, and science backs its power. Its active compound, curcumin, supports a healthy inflammation response, which matters because inflammation can affect your heart and blood vessels.

One meta-analysis found that turmeric may help manage blood lipid levels, which play a role in cardiovascular health. Another analysis showed long-term turmeric use may support healthier blood pressure.

You can find turmeric in capsule form, golden milk blends, or use it directly in cooking. Just make sure it includes black pepper for better absorption.

# Try Hawthorn for Cardiovascular Support

Hawthorn is one of the oldest herbal remedies for heart health, and it‚Äôs not just folklore. Studies show it may help reduce blood pressure and anxiety in people with mild hypertension.

Hawthorn is rich in compounds like flavonoids and OPCs, which help your blood vessels stay flexible and strong. In one clinical study, participants who took hawthorn extract experienced improved blood pressure after just 12 weeks.

# Add More Oats to Your¬†Plate

Oats are a powerhouse food for both cholesterol and blood pressure. Their fiber, especially beta-glucans, helps regulate cholesterol while also supporting healthy blood flow.

They also contain selenium, a mineral that supports your heart‚Äôs defenses against oxidative stress.

Make oats interesting with toppings like berries, flaxseed, or almond butter, or try overnight oats to save time in the morning.

# Drink More Water Than You Think You¬†Need

Your blood is nearly 50% water. If you‚Äôre dehydrated, even slightly, your blood volume drops, and your heart has to work harder to circulate it, raising your blood pressure.

To stay hydrated:

* Aim for 8+ cups of water a day
* Eat hydrating foods like cucumber, grapes, and melon
* Drink herbal teas that count toward your water intake
* Balance every cup of coffee or alcohol with a glass of water

Hydration might sound simple, but it‚Äôs one of the most overlooked ways to support your heart.

# Trade Caffeine for Adaptogens

Caffeine gives you energy, but it can also cause sharp spikes in blood pressure. If your heart is already under stress, that‚Äôs not helpful.

Adaptogens provide a smoother, steadier form of energy without overstimulating the nervous system. Maca root boosts stamina and focus. [**Ashwagandha**](https://curatedwellness.com/collections/ashwaganda?_pos=1&_psq=ashwagandha&_ss=e&_v=1.0) supports recovery and calm. Rhodiola helps with physical and mental fatigue.

# Use the Outdoors to Reset Your¬†Body

Americans spend about 92% of their time indoors, according to the EPA. That indoor lifestyle can raise stress and lower overall well-being.

Nature therapy, like grounding (barefoot walking), forest bathing, or simply sitting in the park, can help lower blood pressure and reduce stress hormones.

Even 20‚Äì30 minutes outside daily can make a measurable difference. Try moving your yoga, prayer, or phone calls outside. You‚Äôll get sunshine, fresh air, and a calmer heart.

# Sip Hibiscus Tea for a Tasty Heart¬†Boost

Hibiscus tea has been clinically studied for its potential benefits to heart health. One review found that drinking hibiscus tea daily helped lower blood pressure in multiple human trials.

Its deep red color comes from antioxidant compounds that may help relax blood vessels and reduce inflammation.

Steep it hot or chill it with a little citrus; it tastes as good as it works.

# Feed Your Gut to Support Your¬†Heart

There‚Äôs a strong link between gut health and blood pressure. A healthy gut microbiome helps reduce inflammation and supports vascular function.

Strains like Lactobacillus paracasei and Streptococcus thermophilus may help maintain healthy blood pressure by improving digestion and immune balance.

To support your gut:

* Eat fermented foods like yogurt or kimchi
* Include fiber-rich foods daily
* Consider a high-quality prebiotic + [**probiotic supplement**](https://curatedwellness.com/collections/probiotics?_pos=1&_psq=probiotic&_ss=e&_v=1.0)

Your heart and gut talk more than you think, and both benefit when you take care of your microbiome.

Just looking to chat with whoever‚Äôs around‚Äîdon‚Äôt really mind where you‚Äôre from. I‚Äôm up for talking about whatever you‚Äôve got going on today/tonight, whether it‚Äôs something interesting or just passing the time.

I‚Äôm into the gym, swimming, gaming, hot girl walks, beach days, and sports. I also love chatting rubbish with strangers online and learning new stuff for no real reason. Big fan of black coffee and caf√© vibes too.

1neyox9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_curatedwellness/comments/1neyox9/6_best_natural_energy_alternatives_to_coffee/,6 Best Natural Energy Alternatives to Coffee,"# Eat a Low-Glycemic Diet

When you eat foods that digest slowly, such as oats, lentils, eggs, or leafy greens, you provide your body with steady fuel. These foods prevent the sugar spikes and crashes that leave you dragging later.

A low-glycemic diet helps your blood sugar stay balanced, which keeps your energy levels even. It‚Äôs one of the simplest and most powerful changes you can make for better daily stamina.

# Don‚Äôt Skip Breakfast

Your body needs fuel in the morning, not just caffeine. A balanced breakfast sets your metabolism in motion and helps regulate your mood and focus.

Eggs are a top choice; they‚Äôre packed with protein and healthy fats that help stabilize blood sugar. Add some greens, fruit, or whole grains, and you‚Äôve got a nutrient-rich start that keeps you energized well past noon.

Skipping breakfast can also throw off your intake of key nutrients and has been linked to a higher risk of chronic health issues. Starting your day with a real meal pays off more than a rushed cup of coffee ever will.

# Drink Green Tea

[Green tea](https://curatedwellness.com/search?type=product%2Carticle%2Cpage%2Ccollection&options%5Bprefix%5D=last&q=Green+Tea)¬†gives you a gentle boost without the crash. It has less caffeine than coffee, but still enough to help you stay alert and focused.

What makes it different is a natural compound called L-theanine. It works with caffeine to help you concentrate without making you feel nervous or shaky.

Green tea also supports your health in other ways:

* It fights inflammation
* It‚Äôs good for your heart
* It may help protect your brain as you get older

If you don‚Äôt like drinking tea, you can still get the benefits by using green tea capsules or extracts.

You can also opt for matcha if you're looking for something stronger. It‚Äôs a powdered form of green tea with even more antioxidants and a smooth, steady energy boost.

# Try Eleuthero Root (Siberian Ginseng)

Used in traditional medicine for centuries, Eleuthero is an adaptogen. That means it helps your body handle stress more efficiently, without causing a crash or overdrive.

It has been studied for improving endurance and reducing both mental and physical fatigue. Athletes have used it to support performance, but it‚Äôs just as useful for a mid-afternoon slump.

Other adaptogens, such as maca, rhodiola, and ginkgo, also help naturally boost energy and can be used according to your body‚Äôs needs.

# Use Herbal Energy Blends

Blends of herbs and botanicals can be incredibly effective if you choose the right ones. Some great options include:

* Energy Vitality: it comes with ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, and nettle for mental clarity
* Plant Force Liquid Iron: It helps maintain healthy iron levels, which directly support energy
* Maca Boost with Cacao and Ginger: This combines adaptogens with energizing flavors.
* Adaptogen Performance: This formula utilizes Cordyceps and¬†[Ashwagandha](https://curatedwellness.com/collections/ashwaganda?_pos=1&_psq=ashwagandha&_ss=e&_v=1.0)¬†for enhanced stamina and stress support.

You need to try one or two to see what works best for you. Everyone‚Äôs energy patterns are different, and your best solution is the one that fits your lifestyle.

# Take a Brisk Walk

You don‚Äôt need a gym. A 20‚Äì30 minute brisk walk is enough to raise your heart rate, get oxygen flowing, and shake off mental fog.

Exercise boosts natural endorphins, your body‚Äôs own feel-good chemicals. It sharpens focus, improves mood, and helps restore energy when you‚Äôre feeling drained.

Walking outside adds another layer. Nature lowers stress, lifts mood, and gives you a sense of clarity that indoor environments just can‚Äôt match.

1neyovs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1neyovs/feeding_the_voices/,Feeding the Voices,"	 Pulling into the parking lot, I already know today was going to be a long day at work. With a sigh, I get out of the car and make my way to the custodial area of the university. The snow crunching underneath my feet, the clouds gathering into a sign of false promise of a peaceful night. The forecast said that tonight was going to be clear and cool. There‚Äôs a light dusting going on, the wind playing with the snow, dancing in small swirls. As quick as the dance commenced, it died just as fast. I‚Äôm breathing out smoke against the nip in the air. Keeping my fingers crossed that the weather doesn‚Äôt pick up.¬†



	Walking into the hospital, I stomp my feet to clear off any remaining snow on my shoes. Whomever laid down the ice melt went a little overboard. Either they weren‚Äôt paying attention, or they did it in a hurry. It‚Äôs not like we get reports of falls that often, but we do what we can to minimize them. But a clumsy person is a clumsy person. They‚Äôre gonna fall regardless of the weather. The night shift has its perks. You get to sleep in as late as you want, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the dumb morning shifters asking you idiotic questions, the facility is practically empty. You‚Äôd have to go out of your way to actually talk to someone.¬†



	After putting away my winter stuff in my locker, I walk out to the main space for the custodial department. It‚Äôs almost eleven-thirty, the second shifters should be coming in any minute. ‚ÄúJerry, can you come in here for a second?‚Äù Greg, my boss, called for me from the main office. Made my way over to see Greg and someone I haven‚Äôt met yet standing beside Greg. ‚ÄúJerry, this is our new employee, Veronica. Veronica, this is Jerry.‚Äù Veronica is pretty easy on the eyes. She‚Äôs barely five-feet tall against my six. Her blonde hair in a ponytail with two strands of hair framing her thin face. ‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù I said, holding out my hand. ‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù said Veronica, meeting my hand with a decent grip. I jokingly shake my hand away in mock pain, ‚ÄúWoah, woah, easy. Save your strength for the shift.‚Äù Veronica chortled, ‚ÄúWhatever, you just need to hit the gym more.‚Äù The two of us laughed a little, Greg wasn‚Äôt too thrilled; he was probably ready to call it a night. ‚ÄúJerry,‚Äù said Greg, a little too loudly, trying to get our attention, ‚Äúyou are going to take Veronica with you on your trash run. She has an idea of how the job works. I think it would do her good to see how to get around the hospital. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take the scenic routes and any short cuts you can think of that she could use in the future.‚Äù I nodded, then looked at Veronica, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind a little trash, do ya?‚Äù Veronica shook her head, ‚ÄúI used to work for a cleaning company that mainly focused on helping hoarders clean their living spaces. Apartments, to trailers and houses. I‚Äôve seen some horrors, trust me.‚Äù I believed her. Hoarding isn‚Äôt anything to scoff at. There have been a couple of family members who were hoarders. Only one was able to truly get a handle on things and got their place under control. The others became one with the waste they were collecting. Either by dying under a collapsed mound of heavy items, or falling asleep while cooking something in the kitchen with them burning alive in the house. You either remove the trash, or the trash removes you.



‚ÄúAnyway, the key box is open. You might have to wait for Charles to come in for the compactor key,‚Äù said Greg. ‚ÄúAs for me, I‚Äôm for this double shift to be over. I trust things will go well tonight.‚Äù Veronica looked at each other, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep him in line.‚Äù I chuckled, ‚ÄúOh okay, we‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù Greg shakes his head, ‚ÄúWith that, I‚Äôm going home before I call the house supervisor to see if I could pass out in a spare room.‚Äù Greg put on his coat, grabbed his bag, and he left the office. We followed behind him to head back into the main area. Charles walked in with the rest of the custodial crew. We were basically split into two different kinds of custodians, ones who specialize in cleaning the patient rooms, the ones who focus on different areas and offices of the hospital, and the trash people. Since its third shift, we didn‚Äôt need a lot of people on the floor. Maybe two custodians to flip rooms or touch up other parts of the hospital. It‚Äôs very rare for a patient to be discharged in the middle of the night.¬†



‚ÄúHey Charles, how did it go?‚Äù Charles gave me a look while he handed me the trash keys. ‚ÄúTonight was something, let me tell you,‚Äù Charles walks over to the counter where the sign in list is at. ‚ÄúThe first shift guy, Randal, I was told that he up and left in the middle of the shift. The last time someone saw the guy was around lunch break. He wasn‚Äôt even in any of his hiding places. The trash was starting to pile up and we had the trash keys with him. Thankfully, Greg was able to find the spare keys. DO NOT lose these. If you do, then all hell will break loose.‚Äù Greg goes into his locker, grabs his coat and winter garb, and starts putting them on. ‚ÄúThey actually had to get a hold of me to see if I wanted a little over time by coming in early. I mean, I‚Äôll never say no to extra money.‚Äù Greg laughs at this, I‚Äôm looking over the keys, double checking I had the ones I really needed. ‚ÄúCharles, where‚Äôs the key to big blue?‚Äù Charles starts patting his pockets until he finds the right pocket, reaches in, and pulls out a single key on its own key fob. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt think big blue needs, umm, any attention tonight,‚Äù says Charles is dodging eye contact with Veronica. ‚ÄúIf anything, maybe check on her after your dinner break. But I doubt she‚Äôll need anything.‚Äù Veronica looks at me, looking for the punch line, my stern face not backing down. ‚ÄúGuys, what is going on? What is ‚Äòbig blue;?‚Äù Charles laughs, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll find out soon enough.‚Äù Charles starts to head out of the custodial area with the rest of the second shifters. He stops, turns around and walks up to Veronica. ‚ÄúLittle advice?‚Äù Veronica nods. ‚ÄúWhatever you do‚Ä¶don‚Äôt pay any attention‚Ä¶to big blue. Ignore any whispers or voices you may hear. Just dump your waste, and walk away. Jerry will tell you more, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù Charles pats Veronica‚Äôs shoulder, then he made his way out.



The shift went by as well as it could. Veronica was a little confused and worried with what Charles told her. And I don‚Äôt blame her. It was very eerie to have someone telling you to ignore anything you may hear from something called ‚Äòbig blue‚Äô. I showed Veronica the ins and outs of the hospital in good time. But the main part he showed her was the main hallway that leads from the welcome area, down to the cafeteria and of course, to our area. It took Veronica a couple of passes of the hallway near our area to realise that the morgue was practically next door to our department. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶do we have to go in there to grab trash?‚Äù I looked at her to see Veronica standing in front of the door with some hesitation. ‚ÄúWhat? The morgue? Not every night. The person doing the trash run doesn‚Äôt have the key for that place. The mortician will contact someone on either first or second to let us know they have trash or biowaste to collect. The manager will then notify security, and an officer will meet up with us near the custodial department, and will escort us to go inside the morgue. It‚Äôs a whole process.‚Äù I went to push the trash cart down towards the compactor, but noticed Veronica still looking at the door to the morgue. After pushing the trash cart to one side of the hall, I walked towards Veronica, slowly put my hand on her shoulder, with Veronica gasping a little and jumped slightly. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Veronica laughed at herself, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs night time, there really isn‚Äôt anyone else around, and I have watched Romero movies far too many times. I guess I just spooked myself a little.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I reassured her, ‚Äúnothing is going to walk out of the morgue and eat you. All you gotta do on nights like this, is to keep busy. Then before you know it, you‚Äôll be on your way home. Okay?‚Äù Veronica nods her head, ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù We walked back to the trash cart, and made our way to the compactor.



‚ÄúHey, when are we going to see the infamous big blue?‚Äù asked Veronica. I pack up my Tupperware container back into my lunch bag and stand up. ‚ÄúWe can go now, if you want.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, okay, sure!‚Äù Veronica seemed excited. Everyone is excited to meet big blue. I remember when I was thrilled to see something new. Now? I wish to be doing something else. We walked up to where we parked the trash cart, Veronica was getting ready to push it, while I kept walking. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be needing that.‚Äù Confused, Veronica moved around the cart and caught up with me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve been paying attention to where we are right now. But it‚Äôs a little tricky to get to blue.‚Äù We entered the main machinery room, walked past the furnaces and ac units. It didn‚Äôt take long, but we made it to the very back of the room, to a hatch on the floor. Squatting down, I start opening the hatch to reveal a ladder leading down. ‚ÄúWant to go down first?‚Äù I asked, jokingly. Veronica looks down and hesitates, ‚ÄúYou better go down first.‚Äù I shrug, and start making my way down. I called up to her to let her know that it‚Äôs safe to climb down, and she does.



Once Veronica is all the way down, she starts looking around, ‚ÄúWhere-‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in that room,‚Äù I interrupted her, already knowing what she was going to ask. I lead the way toward the only door in the room. After unlocking the door, Veronica moves toward the door, but I hold up a hand, ‚ÄúRemember what Charles told you: don‚Äôt pay attention to anything you may hear. You might hear screaming, crying, or someone asking for help. Don‚Äôt acknowledge them. Don‚Äôt pay attention to them. Just walk in, do your task, then leave as quickly as you can. Understand?‚Äù Veronica, with trepidation in her face, nods. I fully open the door, and we walk in.



‚ÄúWhat? Are you kidding me? This is big blue!?‚Äù It was a big blue compactor that's connected to the wall. There‚Äôs a little walkway where you use the stairs to get up to the dumping area. To the side of the door, is the control panel for big blue that has only three buttons: Start, Emergency Stop, and Purge. ‚ÄúWhat kind of waste do you bring down‚Ä¶‚Äù Veronica stops to listen. A raspy voice cuts through the silence, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶meeeeee‚Äù the voice said. Veronica starts to slowly look around the room. ‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶did you hear,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt pay attention. Look, here‚Äôs how you use blue,‚Äù I waved a hand towards the stairs leading to the hatch and the control panel. Veronica studies the panel, ‚ÄúPurge? What does that‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice echoes again, a little louder, the raspiness turned into almost a gargle, ‚ÄúHeeeeeeelp‚Ä¶.meeeee,‚Äù another voice, a whisper, adds in, ‚ÄúHe pushed me‚Ä¶.he pushed me in here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you ignore this?‚Äù Sweat is starting to form on my face, I‚Äôm starting to rush through this part of the training, ‚ÄúYou open the hatch, put the waste in, close the hatch, and hit the start button.‚Äù ‚ÄúJerry?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you hear anything wrong while blue is compacting, you hit the emergency button, then report to the manager.‚Äù A scream from inside the compactor interrupts me, ‚ÄúHEEEEEEEEELP USSSSSS!!!! HE LEAD ME HERE, PUSHED ME IN, AND CRUSHED MEEEEEEEE!!!! I SCREEAMED AND SCREEEAMED, BUT NO ONE CAME!!!‚Äù Veronica is now shaking me, ‚ÄúJerry, we have to leave. We need to get out!!‚Äù



\--But Jerry couldn‚Äôt hear Veronica. Jerry‚Äôs eyes turned pitch black. For he understands. The ones lucky enough to meet me understand. Patients were complaining about hearing voices in their rooms. Whispers of broken promises, empty threats, deadly suggestions. The father and a handful of sisters searched the rooms, searched the offices, and finally, found me. They tried cleansing me, they tried blessing me. But sooner or later, they understand. The only way to calm me, to put me at ease‚Ä¶is to feed me. Veronica is shaking Jerry, shaking him, thinking that will get his attention. But he is mine. Jerry looks down at Veronica, grabs her head, and slams it into the metal railing. She collapses, blood streaming down her face. Her senses are blurred, and she is questioning what just happened. Jerry, not missing a stride, opens me up. He then picks up Veronica, and throws her into my hatch, my watering mouth. Jerry watches Veronica slightly move around inside, trying to figure out where she is, what she‚Äôs touching. Just as quickly as it started, my hold on Jerry lifts.--



‚ÄúJerry? What‚Ä¶what happened?‚Äù My vision clears, and I realize what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm standing in front of the hatch and I see Veronica in big blue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm, I‚Äôm sorry Veronica. But blue has to feed. It has to be you.‚Äù I look down in blue to see Andy, the first shift trash guy. I guess the first shift manager told Andy to go check on blue. Maybe the voices got to him, maybe she got hungry. I reached into his chest pocket, and luckily found the first set of trash keys. The raspy voice comes back, ‚ÄúWhhhhhhaaaat are you waaaaiting fooooor? Finnnnnnish the joooooo,‚Äù ‚ÄúJerry, Jerry don-‚Äù I slam the hatch, and slide the lock closed. Veronica has started to scream, pounding on the door. I push the start button, and big blue starts to compact. Sounds of Veronica fighting to stay near the hatch door, but big blue‚Äôs tongue is much stronger, pushing her towards the other side of blue. With the screams becoming more and more quiet, I closed and locked the door, made my way up the ladder, and closed the floor hatch.



‚ÄúJerry, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù Greg came walking in the main custodial area. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Veronica?‚Äù I took a sip of coffee, and gave him a solemn look, ‚ÄúBig blue got hungry.‚Äù Greg‚Äôs smile faded away. He then walks into the office, puts away his winter garb, and sits down near his desk, hands slide behind his head. ‚ÄúI found Andy.‚Äù Greg looks at me slightly surprised. I toss him Andy‚Äôs keys, ‚ÄúMight want to call Charles. Him and Blue, they have an understanding.‚Äù Greg nods his head, ‚ÄúAnd you? Why does Blue keep you around?‚Äù I put on my coat, ‚ÄúShe trusts me. Blue knows I can deliver.‚Äù I walk out of the office, and make my way out of the hospital. It‚Äôs not everyday that I see big blue. But the old girl still knows how to have a good time. I just hope she doesn‚Äôt have that kind of fun with me.¬†¬†

She needs to go. I am spread too thin with these cats. I took her in at the behest of my gf in spite of my initial apprehension.

We‚Äôre friendly, often grab lunch together, and I genuinely like her she‚Äôs kind, funny, and great at her job. But lately, her oversharing has gotten out of control, and it‚Äôs making me super uncomfortable.

She‚Äôll dive into super personal details out of nowhere. Like, we‚Äôll be talking about weekend plans, and suddenly she‚Äôs describing her latest therapy session, her dating app horror stories (with way too much detail), or even her family drama with her mom‚Äôs divorce. Last week, during a coffee break, she started telling me about her medical history, including some graphic stuff about a surgery she had. I‚Äôm pretty private myself, so this feels overwhelming, and I never know how to respond without sounding rude or awkward.

It‚Äôs not just me other coworkers have mentioned they‚Äôve noticed it too, but no one‚Äôs said anything to her. The problem is, I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings because she‚Äôs clearly going through a lot, and I think she sees me as a safe person to vent to. But it‚Äôs draining, and it‚Äôs starting to make me dread our interactions. I‚Äôve tried subtly changing the subject or saying I have to get back to work, but she doesn‚Äôt pick up on it.

We‚Äôve got a big team project coming up, so I‚Äôll be working closely with her for the next few months, and I‚Äôm worried this will get worse. How do I set boundaries without making her feel rejected or embarrassed? Should I just be honest and say her oversharing makes me uncomfortable, or is there a gentler way to handle this?

It has settled into working but on some days being a bit ""meh"" compared to how it was at first. This was expected as everyone said it would happen and I still get emotional regulation and am doing the housework, so whatever.

I have seen suggestions that taking the supplement, L phenylalanine, which is a dopamine precursor, helps maintain efficacy. I tried some the other day.

I am used to the 70mg lasting 8 hours and then dropping hard.

When I took the L phenylalanine, a couple of hours before that drop was due, I quickly became extremely tired and fell asleep for 90 minutes. OK, take it at night then. Understood.

The next day, however, the 70mg hit me like a freight train. At 8 hours not only was there no sign of a drop; I felt massively overstimulated. The drop finally came at 9 hours and 40 minutes. I then halved my dex dose to only 10mg, which lasted an hour longer than I was expecting. It eventually ran out after nearly 14 hours, and I then had the best night's sleep I've had in a long time. Didn't take any L phenylalanine the next day, and the 70mg worked better than expected, but didn't cause the overstimulation issues I'd had before, and took 20mg of dex as normal, and had a really good day.

Last night I took the L phenylalanine again, after my dex wore off. Because I had a nasty drop, I also had a coffee, which often softens my drops a lot. A few minutes later I felt deeply unpleasantly sedated, with a sleepiness that I felt in my bones. Also didn't have any racing thoughts, which I usually get at night, at all. Even the earworm was barely there. Fell asleep with far more ease than I'm used to.

So that brings me to today. I've water titrated my 70 down to 50 to avoid the overstimulation I experienced before. It's feeling incredibly effective. Feeling super focused, motivated,  and my brain is quiet.

So I guess my question is, is it normal to get this when supplementing with L phenylalanine? I guess maybe over time the Elvanse depletes dopamine precursors and that has some sort of blunting of efficacy. My partner is also on 70mg and took the supplement last night, but with her usual 70mg and she is now saying that she feels ""wired"", so it's not just me.

This also serves to reaffirm by bafflement at the idea of recreational amphetamine use, because that overstimulated feeling is just not nice.",6,1757669194.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False
1neyhso,https://i.redd.it/zdiiena1cpof1.jpeg,Got the Galaxy S25 Ultra (Silver Blue Titanium)‚Ä¶ but part of me still thinks about the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Did I make the right call?,"Alright, let me tell you the full story because this has been one hell of a journey for me.

For months, I was dead set on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. That was the phone I wanted. The dream. I was already imagining how I‚Äôd flex it on my girlfriend (she has a 15 Plus) and even had this cheesy plan to post a picture with a coffee cup and a deep ‚Äúgrateful for everything‚Äù caption. The hype was real.

Then rumors of the iPhone 17 Pro Max started floating around with that redesigned body. My brain instantly went into ‚Äúwhat if I regret it‚Äù mode. I told myself I‚Äôd wait until the 9th of September when Apple announces it, see if the new features are actually worth it, and then decide between the 16 and 17.

Fast forward‚Äîme and my dad hit the mall. I was so close to walking out with the 16 Pro Max, but then reality hit: the monthly installment deal I was relying on was for credit card holders only. My dad doesn‚Äôt use credit cards. That‚Äôs when the whole iPhone plan started to collapse.

Here‚Äôs where the twist comes in: my dad looks at me and goes, ‚ÄúForget the iPhone, let‚Äôs get the S25 Ultra.‚Äù At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to feel. I was wired into the iPhone mindset, man. But then we saw it‚Äîthe Silver Blue Titanium S25 Ultra sitting there, looking like an absolute beast. And with a weekend offer, we got it for $960 instead of $1,299. That‚Äôs not a small discount.

Now I‚Äôm here, typing this from my S25 Ultra, and honestly? This thing is buttery smooth. The display, the power, the whole premium vibe‚Äîit feels insane. Part of me is shocked that I‚Äôm not even sad about skipping the 16 Pro Max. I thought I‚Äôd feel regret, but I don‚Äôt. At least, not completely. There‚Äôs still that small voice in my head going, ‚ÄúWhat if you had just waited and grabbed the iPhone instead? Was this really the right move?‚Äù

I know spec-wise the Ultra blows the 16 Pro Max out of the water. Objectively, it‚Äôs the stronger device. But Apple has that ‚ÄúiPhone factor‚Äù I always thought I needed, especially since I was planning to flex it a bit. Now I‚Äôm happy as hell with this S25U, but I keep thinking if I should‚Äôve stuck with my original plan.

So here‚Äôs my question to you all: do you think I‚Äôll regret not going with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, or did I just dodge the ‚ÄúApple tax‚Äù and end up with the smarter choice?

1neyhql,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1neyhql/best_vpns_for_call_of_duty_mobile/,Best VPNs for Call of Duty Mobile,"Call of Duty Mobile has captivated over 100 million monthly players worldwide, making it one of the most popular mobile gaming experiences available. However, with this massive popularity comes increased cybersecurity risks that every CODM player should understand. **The gaming industry faced a staggering 94% increase in Layer 7 DDoS attacks in 2024**, with mobile gaming platforms being particularly vulnerable to various cyber threats.

While VPNs can enhance your security and privacy when playing CODM, it's crucial to understand both the benefits and the responsibilities that come with their use. This comprehensive guide examines the legitimate security reasons for using VPNs with Call of Duty Mobile, the best providers for gaming security, and how to stay compliant with game policies.

# Understanding CODM's Terms of Service: A Transparent Discussion

Before diving into VPN recommendations, let's address the elephant in the room: **Activision's Terms of Service and enforcement policies**. According to Activision's official Security and Enforcement Policy, the company prohibits ""any code and/or software not authorized by Activision that can be used to gain an unfair advantage, manipulate stats, and/or manipulate game data.""

**The key distinction lies in your intent and usage:**

* ‚úÖ **Legitimate uses:** DDoS protection, public WiFi security, privacy protection, ISP throttling bypass
* ‚ùå **Prohibited uses:** Manipulating matchmaking, circumventing region locks for unfair advantages, stat manipulation

**Important Note:** While VPNs themselves aren't explicitly banned, Activision monitors for suspicious behavior patterns, including unusual ping levels or repeated server switching that might indicate abuse. Many content creators and streamers use VPNs for legitimate security purposes without issues, but responsible usage is essential.

# Why Mobile Gamers Need VPN Protection in 2025

# Rising DDoS Threats Target Gaming Communities

The cybersecurity landscape for mobile gamers has become increasingly dangerous. **Recent data shows that over 30,000 compromised devices were used in the Iran-linked Eleven11bot network specifically targeting gaming platforms and telecom providers**. Mobile gamers face several critical security threats:

**DDoS Attacks on Individual Players:** Competitive gamers are increasingly targeted with Distributed Denial of Service attacks designed to disrupt gameplay during crucial moments. These attacks can cause severe lag, disconnections, and game losses.

**IP-Based Harassment:** Malicious players can use your exposed IP address to launch targeted attacks, gather location information, or conduct other forms of cyber harassment.

# Public WiFi Gaming Risks

Mobile gaming often happens on public WiFi networks in coffee shops, airports, hotels, and other locations. **In 2025, public WiFi threats have evolved beyond traditional security concerns:**

* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks** remain the most significant threat, where attackers intercept communication between your device and gaming servers
* **Rogue hotspots** designed to mimic legitimate networks can capture login credentials and personal data
* **Packet sniffing** allows cybercriminals to analyze unencrypted traffic and extract sensitive information

# ISP Throttling and Performance Issues

Many Internet Service Providers engage in traffic shaping or throttling of gaming data, particularly during peak hours. **A quality gaming VPN can bypass these restrictions by encrypting your traffic**, making it difficult for ISPs to identify and throttle gaming-specific data packets.

# Account Security and Privacy Protection

CODM accounts contain valuable in-game assets, payment information, and personal data. VPNs provide an additional layer of protection by:

* Masking your real IP address from other players
* Encrypting all data transmission
* Protecting against account reconnaissance attempts
* Securing login credentials on unsecured networks

# Essential VPN Features for CODM Security

When evaluating VPNs for Call of Duty Mobile security, focus on these critical features:

# DDoS Protection Capabilities

**Anti-DDoS infrastructure** is perhaps the most important feature for competitive mobile gamers. Look for providers that offer:

* Dedicated DDoS mitigation servers

# Mobile Optimization and Performance

Mobile gaming requires specialized optimization:

* **Low-latency protocols** designed for real-time gaming
* **Mobile-specific applications** with gaming modes
* **Optimized server locations** near major gaming data centers
* **Split tunneling** to route only gaming traffic through the VPN

# Privacy and Security Standards

Essential security features include:

# Best Practices for Secure Gaming

* Always use VPN protection on public WiFi networks
* Keep your VPN software updated with the latest security patches
* Use strong, unique passwords for both your VPN and CODM accounts
* Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible

**Privacy Protection:**

* Regularly review your privacy settings in both CODM and your VPN app
* Be cautious about sharing personal information in game chats
* Consider using separate email addresses for gaming accounts
* Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity

# The Future of Mobile Gaming Security

As mobile gaming continues to grow, security threats will likely become more sophisticated. **The integration of 5G networks brings both enhanced performance and new attack vectors**, while the increasing value of gaming accounts makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals.

**Emerging trends to watch:**

* AI-powered attack detection systems
* Enhanced biometric authentication for gaming accounts
* Blockchain-based identity verification
* Advanced anti-cheat systems using behavioral analysis

Staying informed about these developments and maintaining robust security practices will be essential for protecting your gaming experience and personal data.

# Conclusion: Security-First Gaming in 2025

The decision to use a VPN with Call of Duty Mobile should be driven primarily by legitimate security and privacy concerns. **With gaming-focused cyberattacks increasing by nearly 100% in recent years**, protecting yourself against DDoS attacks, public WiFi vulnerabilities, and privacy breaches is not just recommended‚Äîit's essential.

While VPNs offer significant security benefits for CODM players, remember that responsible usage is key to maintaining both your account standing and the integrity of the gaming community. Focus on providers like **ExpressVPN for premium security features**, **NordVPN for comprehensive protection with excellent value**, **Surfshark for budget-conscious multi-device protection**, or **Private Internet Access for privacy-focused gaming**.

**The bottom line:** In 2025's increasingly dangerous cyber landscape, a quality VPN isn't just a gaming enhancement‚Äîit's a cybersecurity necessity for any serious Call of Duty Mobile player. Choose your provider wisely, configure it properly, and game securely.

1neycyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyItemsReview/comments/1neycyc/la_rocheposay_anthelios_uvmune_400_review/,La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Review,"So, everyone and their dermatologist has been buzzing about the La Roche Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 sunscreens. Supposedly, they‚Äôve cracked the code on better UVA1 protection (the sneaky rays that cause aging and hyperpigmentation). Big deal in sunscreen land. The star of the show here is a brand-new filter called Mexoryl 400.

Sounds fancy, right? But let‚Äôs break it down like I would to a friend over coffee: Is it actually worth the hype, or just another ‚Äúscience-y‚Äù flex that doesn‚Äôt change much for the average person?

- - -

## First, What‚Äôs the Big Deal?

*   Sunscreen filters don‚Äôt get invented every other day (regulations make it hard), so Mexoryl 400 is a genuine innovation.
    
*   It fills in a gap that older filters like avobenzone don‚Äôt fully cover, the longer UVA rays (370‚Äì400 nm).
    
*   Translation: It‚Äôs supposed to protect better against pigmentation, aging, and those sneaky rays that get past most sunscreens.
    

- - -

## My Experience With the Formulas

La Roche-Posay didn‚Äôt stop at one product. They dropped a whole lineup: Invisible Fluid, Hydrating Cream, and Oil Control Gel-Cream (each with tinted and fragrance free versions). Here‚Äôs how they actually feel to use:

### 1\. **Invisible Fluid**

*   **Texture:** Super runny. Like, drip-down-your-hand runny. I found myself rushing to rub it in before it escaped.
    
*   **Finish:** A bit tacky and shiny. Definitely not the elegant matte finish the old Anthelios had.
    
*   **Scent:** The fragrance-free one has a weird musty smell (probably from the new filter). Not awful, but not pleasant either.
    
*   **Tinted version:** Oh boy‚Ä¶ way too orange for fair skin. Think Oompa Loompa chic. But friends with deeper skin tones actually liked it¬† looked more like a lightweight foundation.
    
*   **Verdict:** Great UV protection, but annoying texture. I kept thinking ‚Äúwhy is this harder to use than the old version?‚Äù
    

### 2\. **Hydrating Cream**

*   **Texture:** Rich and creamy. If you‚Äôve got dry skin, you‚Äôll probably love it. On my combo/oily skin? Felt heavy and greasy.
    
*   **Finish:** Dewy. Like borderline shiny.
    
*   **Tinted version:** Yellow-toned, which is better than the usual pinky Euro tints. But it oxidized a bit darker as it dried. So again, tricky for lighter skin tones.
    
*   **Verdict:** Works for dry or normal skin, not so much for oily.
    

### 3\. **Oil Control Gel-Cream**

*   **Texture:** My favorite of the bunch. It‚Äôs thicker than a fluid but goes on smooth and settles into a satin-matte finish.
    
*   **Oil control:** Surprisingly good. I didn‚Äôt feel greasy for hours (a rare win).
    
*   **Scent:** Still has that underlying ‚ÄúMexoryl smell,‚Äù but the fragranced version masks it better.
    
*   **Verdict:** If you‚Äôve got oily or combo skin, this is the one that actually makes sense.
    

- - -

## What the Science Says

Clinical studies (yes, paid for by L‚ÄôOr√©al, so take with a grain of salt) showed that:

*   Mexoryl 400 sunscreens helped reduce pigmentation spots more than regular ones.
    
*   Protection is especially noticeable in people prone to hyperpigmentation (medium to darker skin tones).
    
*   If you‚Äôre already careful with shade, hats, or iron oxide-tinted sunscreens, the difference might not be huge.
    

So, yes, there‚Äôs legit science. But don‚Äôt expect your freckles to vanish overnight.

- - -

## The Good Stuff

*   **Next-level UVA protection.** If you‚Äôre serious about anti-aging or pigmentation, this could matter.
    
*   **No white cast.** Even with the strong protection, it blends pretty well into most skin tones.
    
*   **Variety.** Three different textures means at least one should fit your skin type.
    

- - -

## The Not-So-Great

*   **Texture trade-offs.** Invisible Fluid is too runny and tacky, Hydrating Cream is too heavy, tinted shades are‚Ä¶ meh.
    
*   **Smell.** That musty ‚Äúchemical‚Äù scent in the fragrance-free versions isn‚Äôt my fave.
    
*   **Pricey.** Around ‚Ç¨21 for 50 ml in Europe, more if you‚Äôre importing. For daily reapplication, it adds up fast.
    
*   **Alcohol sting.** If your skin is sensitive, that little burn when applying might bother you.
    

- - -

## Who It‚Äôs Actually Worth It For

*   People who spend hours outdoors (outdoor jobs, hiking, beach days).
    
*   Those with pigment-prone skin who notice dark spots easily.
    
*   Sunscreen nerds (like me, lol) who want the latest and greatest filter tech.
    

If you‚Äôre mostly indoors, reapplying faithfully, and already using a solid sunscreen, the upgrade might not feel life-changing.

- - -

## Final Thoughts

The La Roche Posay UVMune 400 range is definitely a step forward in sunscreen science, but day-to-day, the difference isn‚Äôt mind-blowing unless you‚Äôre in a high-risk group (pigmentation-prone, lots of sun exposure).

Personally, I‚Äôll keep the **Oil Control Gel-Cream** in my rotation, it just makes sense for my skin type and lifestyle. The others? Meh. I wanted to love the Invisible Fluid (old version was my holy grail), but the new texture just doesn‚Äôt spark joy.

Bottom line: Amazing tech, imperfect execution. Try it if you‚Äôre curious, but don‚Äôt feel FOMO if you stick with your old favorite.",1,1757668383.0,BeautyItemsReview,0,1.0,False

Then, a couple of wees ago, I decided to try something diferent. I figured, why not? I started off with something simple‚Äîgetting up at the same time every day, even on weekends (yep, painful, I know). I aded a quick stretch and a 10-minute meditation, then a moment to plan my day with a nice cup of coffee. Nothing too craxy, just small changes.

Both materials have their place, but they‚Äôre suited to different needs. Here are some general points that might help anyone deciding between the two:

* **Strength & Durability:** Hardwood is solid timber and tends to be stronger and longer-lasting, making it a great choice for heirloom furniture or pieces that will see heavy use.
* **Stability:** Plywood is engineered by layering veneers with alternating grain directions, which helps resist warping and shrinking. It‚Äôs especially useful for large panels like cabinets, shelving, or table tops where stability matters.
* **Workability:** Hardwood can be planed, carved, and sanded to achieve a variety of finishes, but it also requires more effort and sharper tools. Plywood cuts easily and is quicker to work with, though edges usually need banding for a clean look.
* **Cost & Efficiency:** Hardwood is generally more expensive and can result in more waste if boards aren‚Äôt uniform. Plywood is cost-effective for covering larger areas and makes efficient use of timber resources.
* **Applications:** Hardwood is typically preferred for visible, decorative pieces like dining tables, chairs, or flooring. Plywood is widely used in cabinetry, underlayment, shelving, and even in furniture when paired with solid wood for structure.

Both materials can be excellent choices depending on the project. For example, pairing hardwood legs with a plywood top is a practical way to balance strength, stability, and cost.

When I finally got to the counter, I reached for my wallet‚Äîonly to realize I‚Äôd left it at home.

**Background**: my appointment was supposed to be in April but was postponed due to confusion around the decree. It was rescheduled outside of the Prenotami platform. It was 'old rules' though I qualify under the new rules too. I emailed the Consulate General a few days before my appointment advising that I had all original documents however if they needed my fathers file for any reason, his details were XYZ.

I arrived 30 mins before my appointment and was asked for my passport on the door. My name was on their list so I was allowed to go straight in. The doorman advised that my partner could not attend the appointment with me, which was fine - we already knew that. They waited in a coffee shop across the street.

I was asked for the following:

**About me:**

* My passport
* Proof of address (electric bill)
* Birth certificate (translated and apostilled)
* Application form

**About my nonno:**

* Italian birth record (with parents names)
* Italian marriage record
* Italian death record
* National Archives letter (translated and apostilled)
* Declaration of residences

**About my father**:

* UK birth certificate (translated and apostilled)
* Italian birth record (with parents names)
* UK marriage certificate (translated and apostilled)
* Copy of identity card
* Declaration of residences

**My minor children**:

* UK birth certificates (translated and apostilled)
* Copy of their passports
* Copy of their other parents passport

She went away to enter my details into their system and then returned with a letter for me to take down to the ground floor for payment (¬£508). I returned with the letter stamped and left.

I'd read some pretty horrible stories regarding other appointments so was quite apprehensive. We spoke in both Italian and English and I found all the staff I encountered to be very helpful.

**Notes**:

* She had my fathers file out ready for the appointment. I didn't get to look in it, but I could see old documents etc in there. It shows they do keep all the documents they ask for.
* I took the old and the new application form. I had already filled out the old one for my April appointment, but wanted to make sure I wasn't supposed to have the new one. The old one is no longer available on the website. She kept both.
* I did have my fathers UK passport, but she didn't want that when she realised I had his Italian identity card. She also added a copy of his identity card to his file.
* She didn't require any documention regarding my non-Italian parent, nor my Nonna.
* I had my own declaration of residences, she didn't ask for it but kept it when she saw I had it.
* She checked names and dates very thoroughly. I'd had a few corrections made, and was glad I'd done so.",2,1757667286.0,juresanguinis,0,1.0,False

1ney0pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1ney0pv/calico_joe_john_grisham/,Calico Joe - John Grisham,"Hey everyone!

I usually dive into thrillers or fantasy, but this was a delightful step out of my comfort zone. I just finished reading [Calico Joe - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/calico-joe-john-grisham/) and wanted to share my thoughts with you all. It was a really refreshing change!

### What's it about (no spoilers!)

""Calico Joe"" is a heartfelt story centered around the golden age of baseball, a prodigious young talent named Joe Castle, and the lasting impact of a single, fateful pitch. It‚Äôs told through the eyes of Paul, who was a young boy at the time, and whose father was a major league pitcher. The book explores themes of family, forgiveness, ambition, and the weight of choices made in an instant. It‚Äôs less about the legal drama Grisham is famous for, and more about human drama and the deep connections people form, or sometimes, break.

### What I Really Liked

The characters felt incredibly real. Joe Castle, ""Calico Joe"" himself, is this shining star who captures the nation's heart. You feel his innocence and immense talent. Paul's adult reflections truly ground the story, especially his complex relationship with his father. Even if you're not a huge baseball fan, the human story is captivating; you can't help but get swept up in it.

Grisham's writing style here is surprisingly gentle and evocative. He paints such a vivid picture of 1970s baseball without getting bogged down in too much technical jargon. It's clear, straightforward, and truly pulls at your heartstrings. The pacing is just right, building emotional depth without rushing. The characters stayed with me long after I finished the book. It's a truly poignant story that explores redemption and the long shadow of the past.

### A Small Thought

If you're used to Grisham's high-stakes legal thrillers, you might find this a little slower. It's an emotional intensity, a quiet power, which I found refreshing. So, it might not be your typical 'edge-of-your-seat' read, but it's powerful in a different way.

### Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!

I absolutely recommend [Calico Joe - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/calico-joe-john-grisham/). It‚Äôs a beautiful, character-driven story that transcends the baseball setting. If you enjoy thoughtful family dramas, stories about redemption, or just want a break from your usual high-octane thrillers or intricate fantasy worlds, this is a fantastic choice. Perfect for a warm, yet thoughtful, read.

### For New Readers: Your Reading Journey Starts Here!

Reading can feel daunting when you're starting out. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your experience:

**1. How to Pick Your Next Adventure (Step-by-Step):**

*   **Read the back cover or synopsis.** Does the *story* grab you?
*   **Genre Exploration:** If you usually read fantasy, try a mystery! If you love sci-fi, maybe a historical fiction. Sometimes the best surprises are outside your usual box.
*   **Ask Around:** Talk to friends, check out Reddit, visit your local library. People love to share their favorite books!
*   **Read the First Chapter:** If unsure, read the first chapter. If it grabs you, great; if not, move on!

**2. Personal Tips for Enjoying Your Read:**

*   **Find Your Reading Nook:** A comfy chair, a quiet corner, or your favorite coffee shop. Make it a ritual.
*   **Set Aside Time:** Even 15-20 minutes daily adds up quickly!
*   **It's Okay to Not Finish:** If a book isn't clicking, it's okay to put it down. Life's too short for books you don't enjoy ‚Äì so many others await!
*   **Take Notes (Optional):** If confused, a quick note helps, or just reread the last paragraph!

**3. Keep Going - You Got This! (Motivational Advice):**

Remember, reading isn't a race or chore; it's an adventure. Every book is a new world, a new perspective, and a chance to escape. Don't worry about how fast you read, or how many books you ""should"" be reading. Just enjoy the process. The more you read, the easier and more rewarding it gets.

So, if you want a change of pace or a wonderfully told story that stays with you, definitely check out [Calico Joe - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/calico-joe-john-grisham/). Happy reading, friends!",1,1757667041.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

Honestly everyone saying that when you truly are over your ex they come back into your life some way or another. It's true. You can search my posts for the entire story but the tl;dr is that my ex blindsided me and instead of repairing things she decided to go into an another relationship. 

I finally accepted it when I heard that she has a new relationship and stopped contacting her.  Some mutual friends told me he is a literal downgrade. He even messaged me saying that he's thankful that I fumbled her and she looks better with him anyway. I just blocked him. It was not worth it. 

Fast forward 6 months later and a mutual friend kept telling me she keeps asking about me stuff and if I was down for us 3 to go out for a coffee because he saw that they don't follow eachother anymore on Instagram. She accepted it in an instant but I had my doubts  I was really not in the mood, I told my friend that I don't believe she is serious about it and I don't want to risk getting hurt again. He told me she would go out with her first to check her out.

I was thinking maybe I should go back with her, maybe she learnt her lesson, improved. Like every happy ending stories. It couldn't been further from the truth. It seemed she didn't changed at all. A part of me still cared about her but another part screamed that it's not worth it and I felt it in my bones it was a trap.

My friend went out with her at a coffee shop. Turns out the new guy is a drug addict, he convinced her doing drugs with him and her words ""he would call me at his place just for sex"". The most fcked up thing about it is the guy broke up with her because ""he is a bad influence to her"" but she suffers and wants him back BADLY. At that point my friend asked ""what's your intention with -my name-"". She couldn't care less about me. She just wanted to go out because she is alone and is suffering and has no one else to talk to. She said ""meh, he is too small for me""( she is 1cm taller than me and fat, while I am skinny). She has no job, no future and she is still caught up in this with the new guy being blind to the huge elephant in the room. She is almost 30, she worked 1 year her entire life. That was a huge problem for me in our relationship - her lack of ambition. I always tried to motivate her, help her get a career. I gave her unconditional love, I was there for her day and night. It seemed it never mattered,  it actually made things worse. She told my friend she doesn't want to fix anything with ANY exes, but only with this new guy. It seems like she completly lost it.

When I last talked to her I wished that she finds someone that would treat her exactly how she treated me, nothing more, nothing less. She told my friend that my ""curse"" has caught up to her. Honestly I never wished for her to end up THIS bad. I just wanted for her to learn a lesson from all this. But honestly looks like she didn't learn anything and it's time for me to truly move on. 

Anyway , I wanted to thank every one of you for your insights, your stories. They truly helped me get through my rough days, knowing that I am not alone in this world. I truly hope that everyone finds happiness and a partner that it's truly good for them.

I've been best friends with my roommate from law school (let's call him Frank) since 2001. We clicked initially, I suppose, because neither of us came from privilege, unlike many of our peers, and had a vision of practicing law in a socially responsible way.

A bit about me. I spent my earliest childhood in relative poverty with a single father who passed away violently when I was 9. I grew up in a Catholic group home. I am also legally blind. I can't read print at all, for example; all my reading is in Braille or text-to-speech. But I do perceive outlines in space, and I am very proficient at compensating using other senses. I've been also, crucial to this post, *disguising the extent of my ability to function independently.*

For example, if you put a coffee cup in front of me, I will know its position by the sound it makes as it touches the table, and will be able to reach for it confidently. But, I encourage people to hand it to me directly so I don't have to ""grope"" for it.

Why am I doing this? On reflection, I started masking early because it was complicated to explain and I didn't want to be called a liar. A formative moment was when the nuns got me into a self-defense program for troubled and disabled kids. My sensei, himself a man with a disability, drove it into me that I shouldn't advertise my self-defense skills, and, having witnessed violence since an early age - including the violence that took my father from me - my abilities became an ""ace in a hole"" in my mind, a way to surprise a potential assailant.

Then there was the matter of scholarship. To be clear, I earned my grades by my own efforts, but I could never have afforded law school, without a scholarship, and to be blunt, academic success seemed more impressive if it was accompanied by a bigger handicap. By the time I met Frank, acting less capable was a second nature, and I acted that way around him. I guess a part of the ease with which I did it was that before Frank, no one really stayed in my life for long. But Frank and I spent college years together, wingmanning for each other, spending drunken nights under the star discussing the meaning of the universe, then graduated together, joined a legal firm together, and finally started a legal firm of our own.

Then, yesterday evening, Frank dropped at my place unannounced and saw my martial arts gear and outfit. He BLEW UP. He called me a liar and said he wanted to split the firm.

From my perspective, my disability is genuine and how I choose to handle it is not anyone else's business, not even my friend's. But it is gnawing at me. Frank's been longer in my life than anyone and losing his friendship hurts. So, reddit, AITAH? ",0,1757666012.0,AmItheAsshole,14,0.33,False
1nexq90,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/1nexq90/the_problem_with_dining_on_campus/,The problem with dining on campus.,"No, it‚Äôs not the quality of the food.
Moody and Cougar woods have good food, for what it is.

It‚Äôs the hours and the location that‚Äôs a problem.

Moody is closed on saturdays, closes at 3 pm on Fridays, and opens at 11 am on Sundays.

Moody is the most convenient place to go if you live at the towers or at cougar village, and if it was open late at night, it would be safe to go to, which is incredibly important. However, moody is not open 24/7 and the hours are weird.

Also I‚Äôm not allowed to use my own coffee cup to get myself coffee, so I have to use those small ass mugs and I end up spilling shit, because god forbid I use my Arctic cup. But I do need to drink less coffee anyways. So thanks for lowering my caffeine addiction, moody. 

Cougar Woods is open 24/7 but it‚Äôs a long walk from the towers and cougar village, and it‚Äôs at the edge of the campus, near the residential neighborhoods of the third ward. Because of safety issues on campus, and the walk is half a mile where the buildings aren‚Äôt as concentrated, it doesn‚Äôt feel safe walking there. The people who walk to cougar woods in the middle of the night have balls of steel.

It‚Äôs great that the people of the quad and cougar place have somewhere to eat that‚Äôs close to them and 24/7, but I‚Äôm not sure why Cougar Woods is 24/7 and not moody. Cougar woods was basically a dining hall made for the quad and place to eat, and that‚Äôs it. 

And about meal exchanges.

Personally, I haven‚Äôt used an exchange once. I have 3 a week, but It‚Äôs incredibly limited in what you can get. 3 items for most of the fast food places, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. And most of them are closed on the weekends.

I feel like I got massively scammed, and next semester I‚Äôm going to downgrade. It‚Äôs not worth it. 

Again, I must emphasize, the food on campus is good, but it‚Äôs not available all the time, either cuz places are too crowded, or the hours are strange. 

I‚Äôm just saying, I think these places would benefit from having more hours on the weekends, since it can provide students with food, and part time jobs, because there‚Äôs not enough of those.

It‚Äôs my first semester here, so I‚Äôm not as aware of how this campus works. ",1,1757665871.0,UniversityOfHouston,2,0.67,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out?

There‚Äôs this weird effect where:  
- If I see one person recommend something, I hesitate.  
- If three people mention it casually, I start googling.  
- If ten people swear by it, my wallet is already crying.  

Like, how did we all collectively agree this happens? It feels like Reddit evolves into the world‚Äôs most persuasive group chat.  

My favorite (and also least favorite) is how quickly items go from ‚ÄúWhat even is that?‚Äù to ‚ÄúOh my god, I cannot live without it.‚Äù I mean, it‚Äôs dangerously convincing.  

- Has anyone else accidentally bought something that became indispensable?  
- Is there a product that you literally didn‚Äôt need but now can‚Äôt imagine your daily life without?  
- Or am I just weak to Reddit peer pressure?  

There‚Äôs part of me laughing because ‚Äúreddit made me buy it‚Äù is a whole culture at this point. But there‚Äôs also part of me wondering: is it simply community trust or are we all just shopaholics in denial?  

Honestly though‚Ä¶ the little dopamine hit of opening a package that ‚ÄúReddit swore by‚Äù is dangerously fun. Add in discounts, personal stories, the hype‚Ä¶ and suddenly it feels inevitable.  

So here I am.  
Scrolling.  
Browsing.  
And yes‚Ä¶ probably about to buy yet another thing.

1nexjar,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1nexjar/long_covid_for_3_years_just_had_another_infection/,Long covid for 3 years. Just had another infection,"I have had long covid for about 3 years now. I basically had all the stereotypical symptoms like severe brain fog, dpdr, suicidal ideation that didnt feel like myself own thoughts, dysautonomia, panic/anxiety/mania, severe mcas, vomiting daily for a year straight, PEM, severe fatigue that would then take a turn and become severe restlessness and hyperexitability, noise and light sensitivity, sensory overload, tremors, closed eye hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and auditory. 

The symptoms were so extreme that i basically started drinking heavily because my nervousystem would not let me function. For the first time in my life it felt like I actually needed to have a drink. Anyway foolishly i drank every single day in order to cope with symptoms even though it did infact make some symptoms worse like the mcas. 

I tried multiple different things to fix myself like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, cold showers and ice plunges, anti histamine, trying to reset my microbiome, eating low histamine, trying to fix my vagus nerve, brain retraining, hormone therapy. What worked for me the most was getting the mcas under control with hydroxyzine every 6 hours, pepcid 40-60 mg 2 times a day, taking a sleep aid at night called remeron which is also a very very strong antihistamine, and eating animal based by cutting out all processed food and eating only red meat, eggs, goat milk or raw milk, fruit that i could tolerate, sweet potatoes, and basically not using any suppliments besides taurine magnesium when needed. 

I was basically healed now for about 6 months with bare minimum symptoms. I got myself to be able to run a half marathon, weight train 3 times a week, and work full time in construction and that's coming from not being able to work at all for 2 years before. 

Unfortunately I just got a covid infection which honestly was not bad at all. But i know long covid will hit with even the smallest infection. I hit it at all angles with truvada and hiv antiviral, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin( hit or miss with this, may have been beneficial in early variants), made sure to took probiotics, and took lumbrokinase. I also took antihistamines. In 3 days I felt better compeltely besides the stupid stomach once again starting to give issues and a feeling of flatness or no emotion. I dont feel physically covid symptoms what so ever but my gut has definatly been hit by the virus again and I beleive the anhodenia is basically from lack of neurotransmitters being made. This is also insane to because I take vyvanse every single morning which probably raises dopamine higher then any known drug and It feels like im getting no effect from it. Same with coffee. Basically feels like im drinking water. I remember dealing with this in the early days of my long covid but I forget what exactly I did to manage this besides stsrt drinking heavily because the feeling sucked so badly. Any advice on this would be great because I really dont want to suffer again. And also feel free to ask me any questions on what I did during my worst parts of long covid. If you have a weird symptom, i most likely had it as well.  ",2,1757665105.0,covidlonghaulers,2,1.0,False
1nexj8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mysterious-Monkey-72/comments/1nexj8p/pink_noise/,Pink Noise,"Her birthday landed on a Friday and nobody noticed. The kitchen was full of lists for a Saturday wedding, phones ringing, dresses steaming on doorframes. She grabbed toast, waited for someone to remember, then left for school when no one did.

At the front steps a group split the morning like a gate. The polished kids in clean jackets drifted one way. Everyone else moved around them. She kept her head down, walked the long hallway to first period, and tried not to stare at the boy who never had to try at anything.

After last bell she cut through Main to the little record store with the pink neon heart in the window. The clerk with the sharp haircut slid a milk crate across the counter, the way she always did when she could tell a customer needed air. ‚ÄúYou making something for the dance or just hiding out?‚Äù the clerk asked. She shrugged. The clerk fished out a handful of safety pins and pushed them across too. ‚ÄúJust in case.‚Äù

Saturday arrived with bad timing. A teacher caught her rolling her eyes at the wrong moment and she ended up in the library with four strangers. The room smelled like dust and floor polish. The clock crawled. For a while nobody talked. Then they did.

The quiet kid emptied her bag and rebuilt herself with pencil lines and hair falling forward. The loud one threw sparks that hid how tired he was. The golden one let a crack show. The girl in black drew little coffins on a worksheet and pretended not to care. Our birthday girl listened and realized the rules could bend. Near the end they were told to write a letter about who they were. She pressed her pen hard enough to leave grooves on the page and didn‚Äôt sign her name.

On Monday the hallways reset. People looked through each other again. The golden boy‚Äôs friends laughed too loudly. Her locker stuck. Flyers for the spring dance curled on the bulletin boards.

She went back to the record store. The clerk held up a bolt of pale fabric rescued from a back room and said, ‚ÄúThis wants to be something.‚Äù She spent two nights on the floor of her room with scissors and pins, cutting and fixing and unpicking until the dress looked like it had always been hers. When she tried it on, it almost worked. Almost.

The dance lit the gym in soft colors. Paper lanterns swayed. Teachers guarded the doors with coffee cups. She stood by the wall and felt the old ache rise, the one that said she was invisible unless someone decided she wasn‚Äôt. Then the loud one from Saturday passed by and gave her a look that said, I remember. The golden one hesitated in the doorway, hands in pockets, trying to look like he hadn‚Äôt come here for anything in particular.

Music swelled. She took a breath, straightened the seams she‚Äôd stitched, and stepped forward on her own. A hand met hers. Not the obvious hand. A real one. They danced without saying much. The song ended. The lights came up. She didn‚Äôt need to check who was watching.

Sunday was the wedding. The house buzzed like a beehive. She held a bouquet while someone pinned a veil. At the church, rice skittered across the pavement and caught in the treads of dress shoes. After the photos, after the toasts, she slipped outside to the curb to breathe.

A car rolled up. The passenger door opened. On the seat sat a tiny cake in a plastic container with a single pink candle stuck in crooked. No note. Just the candle. She climbed in. The driver didn‚Äôt say anything clever. He didn‚Äôt have to. They set the cake on the dashboard and lit the wick with a cheap lighter that smelled like new plastic. She made a wish she didn‚Äôt say out loud.

Monday returned like it always does. The library was just a library again. The letter she‚Äôd written sat somewhere in a stack on a desk, unsorted. At lunch she walked past the polished crowd and didn‚Äôt flinch. After school she stopped by the shop with the neon heart to return the extra pins. The clerk winked and slid a record across the counter, no charge. The title didn‚Äôt matter.

She carried it home in a paper sleeve, the kind that softens at the corners. On the kitchen table a vase of leftover flowers leaned toward the light. Her name wasn‚Äôt on a card, but she didn‚Äôt need a card. She had stitches that held, a letter no one could misread, and the small heat of a candle she could still feel if she closed her eyes.",1,1757665098.0,u_Mysterious-Monkey-72,0,1.0,False

And your favorite caster? why are those your favorites?,"Pathfinder2e's greatest trait is nailing ""class fantasies"" you didn't even know you had. My two favorites:

  
Caster: Oracle. I love Oracle. Even the awkward pre-master Oracle. Praying to a god is cool for roleplaying, but have you ever been cursed by powers greater than you? Lore Oracles shape grain and sand and dust to form sigils around them. Flame Oracles cause candles to light around them, and Cosmos oracles seem to drift into the heavens slightly. I love playing casters, and in a world where magic is common, playing someone who's magic is still weird is so fun. 

  
Martial: Investigator all day. Mechanically the class just WORKS. Pursue a lead means you get bonuses to effectly just adventuring- as long as you are thinking about the plot. stuff like ""thats odd"" is just a GM's excuse to lore dump on you. ""Devise a strategem"" plays so well into the fantasy. Either you can pull of a crazy turn or pivot to safer option. The more I learn about PF2e as system (5 years in) the more Investigator speaks to me- figuring out what to do with that devise or lack of good roll is an art. The greatest PF2e character I have ever seen was a ranged, coffee drinking, medic +alchemist investigator. Every tool in the book, main healer and main DPR, not a single wasted turn.

So I recently bought Sage Barista Pro second-hand. It's 10 months old and worked fine with the previous owner. She had the proper extraction time, dry pick, etcetera. 

My grind setting is 9 and I get 18g of ground coffee, it just about gives me a good pour, just a bit too fast (21 seconds).
When I then go to grind setting 8, again 18g of ground coffee, it suddenly pours out much faster and tastes much worse. Coffee comes out after 4-5 seconds, total draw time 17s and a wet puck.

I'm at a loss here. Can someone provide some insight?

Weekends slip by faster than they should. So how about we hit pause on doomscrolling, step out of our comfort zones (and pajamas), and do something refreshingly different?

Maybe we start with a visit to a museum or art gallery‚Äîwhere we pretend to ‚Äúget‚Äù abstract art while secretly rating the frame choices and color palettes like undercover critics. From there, we wander into one of Bangalore‚Äôs greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy caf√© for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation‚Äôs still flowing, who knows‚Äîmaybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

About me:
26, tech guy, semi-professional overthinker, full-time curious soul. I like swimming, spontaneous treks, and exploring caf√©s that look like they were built for rainy days and long chats. On weekends, I alternate between doing absolutely nothing and everything at once.

Not to mention the caffeine levels. The vertuo pods made me jittery and feel so unwell. Thank you to whoever posts the caffeine levels of the pods. It's criminal of nespresso to not advertise that the vertuo pods have 2x/3x the amount of caffeine. I might as well drink a redbull.
