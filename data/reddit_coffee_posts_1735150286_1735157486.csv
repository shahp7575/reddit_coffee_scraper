1hm7y40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hm7y40/in_need_of_advice/,In need of advice,"Hi everyone,

I (F31) just ended a 9 year relationship with my boyfriend (M37) - an addict in recovery. He has been sober for 11 months, but his emotional immaturity really made it hard for me to keep coping. He gets angry for really small things since his sobriety (for example : being extremely angry when making a joke with a mutual friend that he always wants to leave very early when we need to go somewhere).

I believe it has to do with his low self esteem that is coming to the surface. He acknowledges this too, but still he feels that I don't understand him. The last time he was very upset when he made coffee for everyone on a trip with friends, and the last day of the trip a friend asked if we bought the coffee ourselves or if he got it from the cupboards in the appartment. He told her he found the coffee in the cupboards, which she replied to that they never take anything from the cupboards (appartment rented from a family friend). He took this very personal and was so upset and angry about it. It took an hour or longer for him to feel okay-ish again and act normal.

Afterwards my friend told me she and her BF felt like they had to walk on eggshells the whole time and she never knew this side of him. She found it 'admirable' how I could deal with this behaviour on a regular basis.

I tried to talk to him about it because I felt his reaction was unfair and disproportional towards our friends, but he felt as if I was worried more about our friends feelings than his feelings. He though I should just support him no matter what.

Eventually I gathered all my courage and asked him to start relationship therapy, but again he felt very attacked (""I worked so hard on myself this year, you want perfection,...""). Afterwards he calmed down and told me he was okay with starting therapy. But something in me already snapped. I just felt so tired and left our house the next day. Initially to find some peace for myself, but I just did not want to go back home to him. So after two weeks at my dad's house I broke up with him.

It's been a couple of weeks now and he really hopes that I change my mind and give our relationship another shot. He says he wants to grow old with me. He believes we can work on it together, but I feel like I can't fix his low self esteem issues and it is affecting my happiness and my mental wellbeing (I feel small in the relationship and I constantly adjust myself so I don't make it harder for him being in sobriety).

I don't know if I am making a big mistake by ending things now that he is sober and trying to work on himself. I am just devastated because there still is so much love between us. I am just so scared to feel stuck again.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

  
TL;DR : Broke up after 9 years because of communication problems with BF, scared that I made the wrong decision because of his recent sobriety.",1,1735157283.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1hm7vew,https://i.redd.it/4r9i7u6rw19e1.jpeg,Coffee Bar next steps?,"I never realized woodworking, and specifically finishing/staining/sealing wood was such a nuanced subject. I had this little nook that acted as a recessed wall for a fridge, but our new fridge didn‚Äôt fit due to hinges on the top of the doors making the fridge too tall. So we moved the fridge and I went to work trying to figure out what to do with this space.

I live in an older home built in the 1960s and a ton of wood and paneling is used around here. Specifically in a below-ground-level second basement that we don‚Äôt use or go into. So I started stripping all that wood off the walls, shelves, and trim. Everything you see here besides the countertop, is just taking wood that was left in this house. Wall panels, random cabinets in the garage or basement, etc.

I have no idea what type of wood I even have, but I need to know what to do next here. Tips on the cabinets as well would be great because I have no idea how to work cabinets. So what stains/finishes should I do for the wall and what should I do with the cabinets? I love the contrast, but it‚Äôs all old and used or scratched. I‚Äôd love to keep the cabinets dark and the wall natural looking, but what‚Äôs the best way to go about this next?

I THINK it‚Äôs S1S2E Cedar as it‚Äôs rough and stringy and darker but I also have no idea. They used beveled cedar panels on the walls, so I assumed the non-beveled wood used for trim or shelves was still cedar, just not beveled. 

The idea is for this to be a coffee bar since there‚Äôs a water line hookup directly below this, and I could hang mugs from the top, but I also don‚Äôt know ideas that I don‚Äôt know. Fill me with them. Please :)

1hm7u1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hm7u1e/laughland_teeth_whitening_a_real_solution_for_a/,Laughland Teeth Whitening: A Real Solution for a Brighter Smile?,"Teeth whitening has become a go-to solution for many of us looking to boost our confidence and improve our appearance. But with so many products on the market, it‚Äôs hard to know which ones actually work without causing harm. I decided to try **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, an at-home kit that claims to deliver professional-level results without the pain and hassle of traditional treatments. Here‚Äôs what I discovered during my experience.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

Laughland isn‚Äôt your typical teeth whitening kit. Unlike strips or toothpaste that only address surface stains, Laughland uses a **dentist-formulated gel** and an LED mouthpiece to target both surface-level and deep stains. This two-part approach promises better and faster results while being gentle on your teeth.

Here are some standout features:

1. **Customizable Formula**: The gel is designed to work on all kinds of stains, from coffee and tea to long-term discoloration caused by age or lifestyle habits.
2. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece helps activate the whitening agents, speeding up the process and ensuring even coverage.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Gel**: Laughland ensures the whitening gel remains potent by storing it in controlled conditions until it reaches you.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

The process is straightforward and takes just 10 minutes a day:

1. **Prepare**: Brush and dry your teeth to ensure the gel adheres properly.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the provided applicator to apply a thin layer of gel to your teeth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Plug it in, sit back, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse**: Remove the mouthpiece, rinse your mouth, and clean the device.

It‚Äôs simple enough to fit into a busy schedule, which is a huge plus for anyone juggling work and home life.

# My Results with Laughland

I used Laughland for six days, following the recommended routine. Here‚Äôs how it went:

* **Day 1**: No visible changes yet, but I appreciated how easy the process was. The mouthpiece felt comfortable, and the gel didn‚Äôt have a strong or unpleasant taste.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I noticed subtle improvements. The surface stains from coffee were starting to fade, and my teeth looked cleaner overall.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were noticeably whiter‚Äîaround 6‚Äì7 shades brighter. The results were even, and my teeth didn‚Äôt look unnaturally white, which I appreciated.

The best part? **No sensitivity.** Other products I‚Äôve tried left my teeth sore or my gums irritated, but I had no issues with Laughland.

# How Does Laughland Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

Having tried everything from drugstore strips to professional treatments, I think Laughland hits the sweet spot between effectiveness and affordability. Here‚Äôs how it stacks up:

1. **Whitening Strips**: While convenient, strips don‚Äôt always cover the entire tooth, leading to uneven results. They‚Äôre also notorious for causing sensitivity.
2. **Professional Treatments**: These deliver dramatic results but are costly ($500+ per session) and often cause discomfort.
3. **Laughland Teeth Whitening**: Offers professional-level results at home for a fraction of the cost, with minimal side effects.

# Tips for the Best Results

If you‚Äôre planning to try Laughland or any teeth whitening kit, here are a few tips to maximize your results:

* **Stay Consistent**: Use the kit daily as directed for the full cycle.
* **Avoid Staining Foods**: Cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process.
* **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly to keep your teeth clean and stain-free.

# Who Should Try Laughland Teeth Whitening?

Laughland is ideal for anyone who:

* Struggles with coffee, tea, or smoking stains.
* Has sensitive teeth and can‚Äôt tolerate harsher whitening products.
* Wants a professional-grade whitening experience without the hefty price tag.

It‚Äôs also a great option for those looking for a simple, easy-to-follow routine that doesn‚Äôt require hours of commitment.

# Final Thoughts

Laughland Teeth Whitening delivers on its promise of a brighter, whiter smile in just six days. It‚Äôs an excellent choice for anyone looking for effective, gentle teeth whitening at home. While professional treatments are always an option, Laughland offers similar results without the cost or discomfort.

1hm7sh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1hm7sh8/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1735156809.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

1hm7qgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kava/comments/1hm7qgb/critique_my_recipe/,Critique My Recipe.,"So, I don‚Äôt drink kava, but my old lady does. After finding out how much money she was spending every day on MY credit card, I decided to start brewing it myself! Lol. I‚Äôm trying to make the strongest kava possible for her since she‚Äôs been drinking about 8‚Äì16 oz a day for the past two years.

After reading a bunch of stuff here and on other pages, here‚Äôs the recipe I‚Äôve been using. How can I make it better or easier?

I take about 2.5 oz of Fiji Vanua medium-grind Vanuatu and throw it in a blender with around 16 oz of hot water. I blend it for about 2 minutes. I just started adding a splash of fat (like coconut milk or coffee creamer) to the blend, and she seems to like it.

Then I strain it through a 75-micron bag and pour about 2 quarts of hot water through the strainer while it‚Äôs sitting there. I let the bag soak in the kava bowl for 10‚Äì15 minutes until it cools down.

After that, I knead and wring the bag out as hard as I can to get all the liquid into the bowl.

For the last step, I strain it again through a clean 75-micron bag into a container where she stores it for the next 2‚Äì3 days.

She says it‚Äôs good, and honestly, I‚Äôve started enjoying the process. I‚Äôm a big coffee guy, so the brewing part is actually fun. But how can I make it stronger and cheaper? Lol, thanks!

I always thought skydiving would be the ultimate rush‚Äîthe kind of experience that makes you feel alive in every sense of the word. When Angela handed me the voucher for my 40th birthday, I couldn‚Äôt believe it. She smiled that perfect, supportive smile, her blue eyes sparkling as she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time you did this, Tom.‚Äù

God, I loved her in that moment. I had no idea what was hiding behind that smile.

The day of the jump was perfect. Blue skies, warm sun‚Äîit felt like the universe was giving me a nod. I suited up, got the quick safety rundown, and climbed into the plane. My heart was racing by the time we hit 15,000 feet, but it was the good kind of racing. Pure adrenaline.

‚ÄúReady, Mr. Wilson?‚Äù the instructor shouted. I gave him a thumbs-up, strapped my parachute tight, and leapt out into the vast, open sky.

The fall was everything I‚Äôd imagined and more‚Äîfreedom, exhilaration, pure joy. I reached for the cord to deploy my parachute, grinning like an idiot. But when I pulled, nothing happened. My grin faded.

I yanked it again. Harder. Still nothing.

‚ÄúOkay, emergency chute,‚Äù I thought, panic creeping in. But when I grabbed for the backup cord, it was useless.

That‚Äôs when the terror hit me. Something wasn‚Äôt right. Something had gone terribly, terribly wrong. As the ground rushed toward me, I realized I wasn‚Äôt going to walk away from this. My last thought wasn‚Äôt fear or sadness‚Äîit was confusion.

How could this happen?

When I woke up, I was in my living room. At first, I thought it was a dream. Maybe I‚Äôd survived the fall and just blacked out. But then I noticed things. My reflection in the mirror was faint, barely there. My hand passed through the coffee table when I tried to touch it.

I wasn‚Äôt alive.

I was a ghost.

I wandered the house, disoriented, trying to make sense of it all. Days passed, maybe weeks. Time felt strange. Angela barely seemed to notice I was gone. I mean, she cried at first‚Äîput on a good show at my funeral‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt last.

It wasn‚Äôt long before she started having people over. Fancy dinners, laughter filling the house. And then there was him. Victor. A smug, good-looking guy who started showing up more and more.

At first, I chalked it up to grief. Maybe she just needed someone to lean on. But one night, as I lingered unseen in the corner of the room, I overheard them.

‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe it worked,‚Äù Angela said, her voice dripping with satisfaction. ‚ÄúAll that money‚Ä¶ and all it took was snipping a few cords.‚Äù

Victor raised his glass. ‚ÄúTo a job well done.‚Äù

The world seemed to stop. My wife‚Äîthe woman I loved‚Äîhad killed me. She sabotaged my parachute, all for money.

And now she was celebrating.

Anger burned through me like fire. I wasn‚Äôt going to let them get away with it. But what could I do? I couldn‚Äôt touch anything, couldn‚Äôt speak. So I started small. Flickering lights. Slamming doors. Whispers in the dark.

‚ÄúAngela‚Ä¶‚Äù

At first, she brushed it off. Blamed the house. But as the disturbances grew louder, more persistent, I watched her confidence crack. Glasses shattered. Messages scrawled themselves onto the bathroom mirror.

‚ÄúI know what you did.‚Äù

She started to unravel. Victor tried to calm her, but even he couldn‚Äôt ignore the growing terror in the house. Eventually, he left‚Äîsaid something about ‚Äúbad energy‚Äù and never came back.

But I stayed.

One night, as Angela lay in bed, I finally revealed myself. I let my form materialize at the foot of the bed, faint and glowing in the moonlight. She froze, her eyes wide with terror.

‚ÄúTom,‚Äù she whispered, her voice shaking.

‚ÄúYou killed me,‚Äù I said, my voice low and cold. ‚ÄúYou betrayed me. For what? Money?‚Äù

She started crying, scrambling for excuses. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to! It‚Äîit just happened!‚Äù

‚ÄúSave it,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúYou took my life, Angela. Now I‚Äôm taking yours.‚Äù

She tried to run the next day, but the house wouldn‚Äôt let her leave. Every door locked. Every window refused to open. I made sure of it. She was trapped, just like me.

Day by day, I watched her break. No more fancy dinners, no more laughter. Just her, alone with her guilt.

Victor never came back. The money didn‚Äôt matter anymore. And as the weeks turned into months, I felt something I hadn‚Äôt felt since I died: peace.

I couldn‚Äôt leave the house, but I didn‚Äôt need to. I had everything I wanted. Angela would live out the rest of her days in misery, haunted by what she‚Äôd done.

And I‚Äôd be here to watch every second of it.",1,1735156486.0,story,0,1.0,False

1hm7nw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1hm7nw6/sam_harris_vs_daniel_dennett_dialogue/,Sam Harris vs Daniel Dennett Dialogue ,"When I was chatting with ChatGPT about free will I ended up asking it to create a dialog between Sam Harris and Daniel Dannett about free will where Dannett eventually convinces Harris that there‚Äôs free will. Sharing it below:

Here‚Äôs a fictionalized dialogue between Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett, set in a hypothetical debate room. They use the analogy of choosing between tea and coffee to illustrate their positions. One of them eventually concedes, though the journey to get there is layered with thoughtful argumentation.

The Scene

Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett are seated across from each other in a quiet caf√©. Each has a cup of coffee in front of them, though neither has yet taken a sip. Sam leans back, his demeanor calm and confident. Daniel is more animated, gesturing as he speaks, his tone passionate but respectful.

The Dialogue

Sam Harris Opens

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúDaniel, let‚Äôs start with something simple. You‚Äôre sitting here with a cup of coffee. Did you truly choose it? Or was your decision determined by factors outside your control‚Äîyour past experiences, your biological preferences, even the way caffeine affects your brain?‚Äù

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúOf course, my choice was influenced by those factors. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt choose it. I considered tea. I thought about my energy levels, the taste I prefer, and even the social context‚Äîcoffee feels right in a caf√© like this. My deliberation, my thought process, is what makes this a free choice.‚Äù

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúAh, but Daniel, that ‚Äòthought process‚Äô you‚Äôre so proud of was itself determined by prior causes. Your preference for coffee over tea? That‚Äôs the result of your upbringing, your exposure to certain flavors, and even the cultural norms you‚Äôve absorbed over a lifetime. At what point did you consciously decide to like coffee more than tea?‚Äù

Dennett Pushes Back

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúI see what you‚Äôre saying, but you‚Äôre mistaking causation for control. Sure, my preferences have a history. But what matters is that I had the cognitive capacity to reflect on them and make a choice. Free will isn‚Äôt about being uncaused‚Äîit‚Äôs about being able to reason. My brain, with its higher-order capacities, allows me to pause, consider, and decide. That‚Äôs free will.‚Äù

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúBut Daniel, your reasoning is just a longer causal chain. You feel like you‚Äôre making a choice, but even that feeling‚Äîyour sense of reflection‚Äîis shaped by prior events. If we rewound the clock to the exact moment you decided to pick coffee, with every molecule in your brain arranged the same way, you‚Äôd always choose coffee. Always. How is that free will?‚Äù

Dennett‚Äôs Counterexample

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúLet me give you an example, Sam. Imagine I‚Äôm on a diet, and I‚Äôm tempted to order a sugary dessert. I feel the craving‚Äîmy biology and past indulgences push me toward it. But then I stop. I remind myself of my health goals, the long-term consequences, and I choose the healthier option. That‚Äôs not just a causal chain; that‚Äôs deliberation. I‚Äôm using my cognitive faculties to override impulses. Isn‚Äôt that free will?‚Äù

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs still not free will. Your decision to prioritize health was itself determined by prior experiences‚Äîyour doctor‚Äôs advice, your fear of illness, your personal values, all of which were shaped by factors outside your control. You didn‚Äôt choose to value health over indulgence; those values were instilled in you.‚Äù

The Turning Point

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúSam, let‚Äôs be practical for a moment. If we accept your view, then no one is ever responsible for anything. A murderer isn‚Äôt guilty because their actions were determined by their upbringing and brain chemistry. A hero doesn‚Äôt deserve praise because their altruism was also shaped by causes outside their control. Is that the world you want to live in?‚Äù

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúNot at all. I agree we still need to hold people accountable for their actions‚Äîfor pragmatic reasons. But let‚Äôs not pretend their actions were freely chosen. Accountability doesn‚Äôt require free will; it requires understanding causality and acting to reduce harm. You‚Äôre conflating responsibility with agency.‚Äù

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúBut if people believe they have no agency, what happens to motivation? Why would anyone strive to improve themselves or contribute to society? My view‚Äîthat free will exists as a higher-order capacity‚Äîgives people the framework to take ownership of their lives while understanding their limitations. Your view risks nihilism.‚Äù

The Winner Emerges

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúFair point, Daniel. I concede that your framework is more practical for motivating individuals and organizing society. But let‚Äôs not confuse its utility with its truth. Philosophically, free will as you describe it is still an illusion‚Äîit‚Äôs a useful construct, not a reality.‚Äù

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúAnd I can live with that. If my construct motivates people to grow, reflect, and make better choices, then it serves its purpose. Call it an illusion if you must, but it‚Äôs one we need to embrace for a better world.‚Äù

Sam Harris:
‚ÄúFine, Daniel. I‚Äôll admit that your perspective offers a more functional narrative for human behavior. But don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stop reminding people that their choices aren‚Äôt as free as they think!‚Äù

Daniel Dennett:
‚ÄúDeal. And I‚Äôll keep reminding them that even in a deterministic universe, their capacity to reflect and choose makes all the difference.‚Äù

Outcome

Daniel Dennett ‚Äúwins‚Äù by convincing Sam Harris that his concept of practical free will (as a higher-order capacity) is more useful for motivating people and structuring society. While Sam doesn‚Äôt abandon his deterministic stance, he acknowledges that Dennett‚Äôs framework has value in real-world contexts.",1,1735156397.0,freewill,2,1.0,False

Kids came over for dinner last night. Talked for a long time. More on that.

I didn‚Äôt sleep well on Sunday night after the fake text stunt. That‚Äôs not me, not who I want to become. Went to STBXWs apt. to drop off new phone. I ask her if I can come in, I have something to tell her. The look on her face makes me think she thought I had filed. Tell her I have her new phone but that she really doesn‚Äôt need it. What do you mean. I tell her that I was the one texting her last night not AP(POS from now on) and apologize for lying to her. She looks depressed and sits down. I tell her that I‚Äôm still hanging on to the 1% life raft, but I can‚Äôt be dishonest if it‚Äôs going to work. She wipes a few tears. Not the reaction I expected. Thought she‚Äôd be pissed. Then she says, This is what I‚Äôve done. Looks at me, you are the most honest, truthful person I‚Äôve ever known and I brought you to this because of my selfishness. I took advantage of your good nature, your faith and trust in me, and betrayed and hurt you in the worst way possible. Now, I‚Äôve never been one to believe the whole ‚Äútriggers‚Äù idea. Always thought that was something for the ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù. Well, I‚Äôve changed that view. Something about her last statement and the way she said it touch me somehow and started crying, something I swore I‚Äôd never do in front of her. Pretty soon I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out. In between sobs I manage to get out a few, how could you do this, do have any idea how much you‚Äôve hurt me, what you‚Äôve done to our children, there‚Äôs a hole in my chest where my heart used to be and a few more. She‚Äôs crying too and sits next to me and puts her arms around me. I get up after we both stop and ask her if she still wants the new phone. She nods so I give it to her. She asks if I read her list. I tell her yes, it‚Äôs a good start, but I don‚Äôt agree with one. She looks puzzled and I tell her the one about me going out and getting laid, having an affair. She tells me that I should. I ask her if she remembered the day we first met, she nods yes. I tell her when I met her that day playing VB at school that even though I felt she was out of my league, that if could win her over and build something together, I wouldn‚Äôt have to be with another woman in my life. After a few dates and the first time we made love, I knew I was right and I was going to to everything in my power to spend the rest of my life you. Until 4 weeks ago I still felt that way, in my eyes she was still that girl I met playing VB. More quiet and crying from us both. I finally tell her I have to go, kids are coming over for dinner. She tells me she won‚Äôt ask to join us, that she understands my need to be away from her. I agree and say that I will only see her at MC for awhile. I tell her I‚Äôm going to talk to the kids about paternity test. Says she doesn‚Äôt blame me and she has no right to ask me to believe her but this is the only time she‚Äôs step outside of marriage. As I‚Äôm leaving she ask me to wait, she has to tell me something else. She emailed HR at her company and resigned. She knows she needs to never see her POS boss if I‚Äôm going to heal. She wants to rat him out to HR and get him fired. I ask her to not do that, it might effect OBS and her divorce. She agrees. Asks me if there is any way that I had any feelings left for her if I could add her to company insurance plan since were still married for the moment. I say yes.

Kids come over for dinner. I tell them about talk mom and I had about paternity test. Reassure them it doesn‚Äôt matter to me, I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS, be their DAD and will love them unconditionally till I die. Son asks if I believed her and I told him I did. He says he wants to ask her. I can tell he‚Äôs angry about thinking he needs to ask. I sternly tell him, that no matter what has happened she is still your mother. You need to work on forgiveness for her. Tell my daughter the same thing. We talk about that for awhile. I also fill them in on what‚Äôs been going on these past weeks. They leave and I try to get some sleep.

***Fri Mar 05 2021***¬†

I need to say thank everyone for all the support,advice and encouragement. It really helps more than you know. Quick update. First, had lunch with OBS on Wednesday. She says that she‚Äôs doing ok, but I really question that. She looked more pale and a little thinner than just a week ago. Said she hasn‚Äôt seen or heard from POS since last Thursday. He came by to pick up the rest of his stuff and told her he was going to stay at extended stay hotel for awhile. So, I guess he‚Äôs not going to be stalking anyone, but I told her she should reach out to her nearest neighbors if she was close enough to them to tell them what happened and ask them to keep an eye out for trouble. She said she would. I ask her if has had the locks changed. Said she hadn‚Äôt thought of that. I told I would come over, see what she needed and take care of it. She insisted I didn‚Äôt have to, but I insisted we were now like brother and sister in betrayal, and besides it‚Äôs less time I‚Äôm alone in my house. She has retained the same lawyer that I have and said she seem like a shark that would take him to the cleaners. I said she‚Äôs your lawyer, your paying her and she will do whatever you need her to do. For me she‚Äôs protecting me if I decide divorce is the best option and has everything ready to go. She‚Äôs also letting me do what I need as I explore the 1% option. I stop by her house and get the locks changed. We agree to try and talk once a week.

Second MC session was yesterday. Hard to tell if this is helping or moving the divorce-o-meter off of the 99-1% mark at all. We discussed the list STBXW made up. Lots of good/great things on the list. STBXW admits that because she has hurt and betrayed me and our marriage so badly that no matter how hard she tries it probably will not be enough but its through no fault of anyone else but her and she‚Äôll have except the consequences. However, until papers are signed she is going to try with everything she has to help me heal and get us back together and if doesn‚Äôt work out she will try to help me move on and get past this, however that may look. She knows that because of her selfish behavior things will never be the same but hopefully we can build something new together. Therapist asks if she going to IC, she went Friday last week and Monday and Wednesday this week with another appointment Friday. Going to continue 3days a week for awhile since she‚Äôs not working. Here‚Äôs the f up part. I ask her if she‚Äôs going to be ok financially since she‚Äôs not working. I shouldn‚Äôt care, right. But I do and can‚Äôt get past that. She says she has her half of our account, got all small severance amount from her company and will take from her 401k if she‚Äôs not working in 4-5 months. Says she considering start her own small IT consulting firm specializing in small start ups, something we had talked about her doing before DDay. Therapist gets us back to the list and asks about the hall pass idea. I tell I‚Äôm not interested. She asks why. I tell her that this is really the first self serving thing that STBXW had done since her come to Jesus moment with family. It‚Äôs not really about me going out and screwing strange women ,it‚Äôs about giving her a way to relieve some of her guilt she feels for the hurt and betrayal she has caused her loved ones, me most of all. They both agree. I tell them that despite not living together I still take our marriage vows as gospel and will keep doing so until we are divorced. Therapist picks up on phrasing right away, on purpose by the way. Until you are divorced? Does this mean you‚Äôve already made up your mind. I tell her that I said from the start that this was going to hard to come back from. However I‚Äôm still clinging to the life raft of 1%, but anymore self serving things like the hall pass and the raft was going to start taking on water. We talk awhile about and we‚Äôre done.

Weather is supposed to be warm here tomorrow so I have guys coming into the shop to start going over equipment for spring work. It will feel good to get going on some projects we have coming up. The fact that this all happened in the middle of winter, cold and long nights and not much at work hasn‚Äôt helped I‚Äôm sure. Had this been spring or summer I could‚Äôve found excuses to put in 16 hour days to keep me distracted. Thanks to everyone.

***Tue Mar 09 2021***

Thanks again to everyone that has reached out with advice, support and encouragement. It really means a lot. Hearing others story‚Äôs is very helpful to.

This is not an update on my andSTBXW. No, this is about POS, the asshat formerly know as AP. I know I‚Äôve mentioned that OBS hired the same lawyer I have. I asked her about this, and she said that there is no conflict of interest etc, and she was happy to help OBS.

Since she hired my lawyer, she has had her investigator do a deep dive into POS for things to use in the divorce. OBS called me and filled me what he found. Let‚Äôs just say POS is an even bigger POS than anybody knew. Think Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park seeing Dino droppings big.

First, it didn‚Äôt take him long to move on from STBXW and start up with someone else at work. Investigator found social media posts and texts between them and was able to be waiting at his hotel when they came from work. My lawyer is going to talk to the woman and get a read on this affair and if she really just a victim

Second, after some digging, he was able to determine that POS had affairs with 3 women at his previous job, not just the one that led to him being fired. He was able to track them down and they both told the same story of how when they decided to pull back from the affair he used his position to create phony bad reviews and job performance issues including attendance issues. Enough to get them fired from their jobs. They were both married and were terrified of their husbands finding out so they just kept quiet about everything. It was the 3rd affair that cost him his job. Her husband found out and told his wife she needed to leave her job and then they both went to HR with evidence of the affair and he was fired. They are still in limbo about their marriage being salvaged.

Third, this one is just the killer. Affair number 2 resulted in her getting pregnant. Her husband had a vasectomy years ago so she was in major trouble. They divorced and her life is in shambles. Husband has custody of their 2 kids and she‚Äôs left raising a child by herself. He has been secretly paying her child support out of separate account that OBS knew nothing about, but wants nothing to do with either of them. He is currently 3 months behind on support.

My lawyer has agreed to represent all 3 women and file a lawsuit for sexual harassment against his former company. She asked me about talking to STBXW about this to see if there was any job related pressure during their affair and take action against her former employer and would understand if I said no. That her first responsibility in this matter was me. I told her no, that I wasn‚Äôt going to give STBXW an easy out for the affair.

So, that‚Äôs it. I have a hard time imagining anyone being a bigger POS than what he is. If there is any karma in the world he would get hit by a truck crossing the street. OBS has been advised by her lawyer that him having a job or not shouldn‚Äôt effect any support she will get from POS, so she is going to go ahead and inform HR at his job. I asked if I can have a hand in that. Still working out t he details. Next few weeks should be interesting.

***Sun Mar 14 2021***

A lot of people hav been asking about how my kids are doing. Thanks. They are dong ok. Came over for dinner with their wife and fianc√© on Saturday. Cooked steaks on the grill. Delicious. Son has been in contact with his mom, even went to see her at her new apartment. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd say he has forgiven her, but let‚Äôs call it acceptance and moving on. My daughter still hasn‚Äôt spoken to her mom since DDay. While she no longer has the outward anger she showed before, she still doesn‚Äôt want to talk to WS. WS has tried to call her several times and she has ignored those efforts. I‚Äôve told her I will support her in however she needs to deal with this, but that its probably not healthy to ignore her mom forever. Thankfully, they both have their SO for support. The plus side is I‚Äôve seen them both together more in the last 6 weeks than the past 6 months.

MC this past week was good. I questioned what the purpose of going weekly is since we aren‚Äôt interacting at all its not really marriage counseling if we aren‚Äôt living together and dealing with the emotions of seeing each other daily. We all agree to give it a few more weeks and talk then. The subject of POS and his history is brought up by therapist. She asks WS how she is dealing with all this new information. WS says that it doesn‚Äôt matter, doesn‚Äôt change anything. She alone is responsible for all of this. Says that she is an intelligent educated strong woman, at least she use to think so. The series of choices and bad decisions she made to get us here today are nobody‚Äôs fault but hers and she has to except the consequences. We talk about this for awhile. Before we are done therapist asks how I feel about all of this, if WS‚Äôs reaction and remorse is starting to change the 99-1%. I tell them while we have dealt with 2 of 3 things I said from the start would make this hard, I still can‚Äôt get past what I walked in on. That many nights I cant sleep cause it‚Äôs playing in my head. When I‚Äôm not engaged with something or someone else, work, gym, talking with kids, nothing else to distract me, I think about it a lot. That until i can thru that part, not much is going to change. She asks if i have talked to IC about it. I have to laugh as I tell her pretty much all we do talk about.

OBS and I still talk daily. I told her WS wants to meet her and apologize to her. She says ok and lets do that next week. OBS tells me about lawyer meeting POS‚Äôs new AP. Contacted her at work. Asked her to meet her at coffee shop in lobby of AP‚Äôs building. Tells her who she is and who she is representing and why. Goes through POS‚Äôs history at last job. Then brings up my WS. POS‚Äôs new AP asks lawyer why she‚Äôs representing POS wife who was cheated on and me who cheated on my WS. Isn‚Äôt that kind of a double standard. Lawyer asks what she is talking about. POS told her the reason my WS took leave of absence and resigned is because I cheated on her. It‚Äôs going around the department that‚Äôs the reason she left. Lawyer tells she needs to get facts straight, that POS was cheating with WS and she, POS‚Äôs newest AP is just the next in line. I guess she didn‚Äôt take that info very well. Lawyer gets info about their affair, she is married, they have only slept together once, but he been after her for awhile. She tells lawyer she‚Äôs going to tell him its over as soon as she goes back to office. Lawyer tells her to contact her if POS pressures her with job to keep sleeping with him. Tells her that how she handles her husband is her business, but that soon all of this is going to come out to HR and that there most likely to be fallout.

Now when OBS tells me about POS lying about me and why WS left I went thru the f ing roof. Had to hang up and started walking around house swearing and screaming. Even scared my dog. I know these people where WS used to work. She had been there 18 years, and I had been to many company outings with her. Some of them have kids same age as mine and we were involved in school stuff. Little League, etc. When I calm down I call her back and ask her to call POS and tell him she needs to talk with him. She asks why and I tell her I‚Äôll pick her up, I‚Äôm going with her. She chuckles and says ok. When we get to his hotel, she knocks on the door and tells him shes here. I‚Äôm fuming and can‚Äôt wait for him to open the door. When he cracks the door I go through it like a cop on a TV show. The door hits him in face and he falls back on the floor. Don‚Äôt think OBS expected that cause shes telling me to calm down as I‚Äôm dragging him in the room calling him every name in the book. I pick him off floor and pin him against the wall and tell him this time he will be spending time in the hospital and I don‚Äôt care if I go to jail. HOW THE FUCK YOU GET OFF TELLING PEOPLE I CHEATED ON MY WIFE. OBS is pulling at my waist telling me to stop, he‚Äôs not worth it, etc. I‚Äôm still screaming at him when I look down and see that I literally have scared the piss out of him. He pee‚Äôd in his pants. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and let him go as i double over in laughter. YOU PISSED YOUR FUCKING PANTS. OBS asks him if he is ok and that surprised me so I kinda stopped laughing. She gets closer to him asking him again if he‚Äôs ok. He says he is as she gets closer. When she close enough she winds up and kicks him right in the balls. Didn‚Äôt see that coming. She must have gotten him good cause he is doubled over really hurt. Now she is calling him the names. After a few seconds pass she pushes his head down as she brings her knee up hard to his face, right in the nose. I think she broke his nose cause its bleeding immediately. She turn, grabs my hand and says lets go. As we‚Äôre walking to my truck I tell her I cant believe you just did that. She tells me she took a woman‚Äôs self defense class a few years ago and she has been wanting to do that since DDay. I tell her we have to stop and have a shot or two to celebrate what she just did. We stop at place I know have a few drinks talking about a pos POS is. I drop her off at home and drive home smiling ear to ear about how all worked out. Wonder what bs he‚Äôll say at work on Monday.

***Wed Mar 17 2021***

Quick update. My house is a mess and I‚Äôm going to be living in the basement for awhile. Right after the first of the year, WS and I took out a home equity loan and had a contractor I know draw up a couple of plans for remodeling the kitchen, LR, DR into a bigger ‚Äúgreat room‚Äù and redoing master bath. Just couldn‚Äôt decide which plan to go with. So, I said, hell with it, I‚Äôm picking and let‚Äôs get going. Before anyone asks, I checked with lawyer and since WS had signed on loan and it was disclosed in the 3 appraisals I had done for deciding equity in the house for splitting it, I could go ahead.

Kids came over last night to talk. Had good pizza for dinner. I told them about POS‚Äôs history, about how OBS and I are trying to help each, about POS lying about me and about what happened when OBS and I confronted him. They were surprised because I‚Äôve always tried not to show real anger to them, but didn‚Äôt blame me. Couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at him pissing his pants. Then moved on to their relationship with mom going forward. Talked about WS coming clean to family and my going off on her. Explained that there is a lot going on with me, and I‚Äôm assuming WS, in IC and both of us in MC that they don‚Äôt know about. That since coming clean WS has been different and has shown remorse and realizes how much she has hurt everyone. We talked a lot, they had questions that I answered, lots of how I‚Äôm coping and what WS is doing to help me heal. I suggested that they both should see IC to help them. Son declined, say I am his IC. Daughter agreed to come to my next IC and meet her and then decide. I suggested that they should sit down with WS and I and the 4 of us could talk. That getting things off my chest to WS helped and is still helping me, that maybe they needed to go off as I did. They both thought that was a good idea as long as I was with them. I‚Äôll let you know how that goes.

Finally, WS met with OBS this morning for coffee. I was there just in case. WS talked first saying how truly sorry she is for all the pain she caused OBS. How she knows that OBS hates her and doesn‚Äôt blame her, that she‚Äôd feel the same. That she hates herself right now, never puts makeup on anymore because she can‚Äôt look at herself in the mirror. Despite what a pos POS is, she was and is responsible for her own actions. OBS wanted to know WS side of the story, see how much POS was lying to her. I had heard most of it before, but then she shocked the hell out of me. That she tried to end it 3 times and each time POS would imply that her job would suffer. Last time told her that he would go to HR and say she offered sex for a promotion, and then would call me. The idea of him going to convention with her was something he insisted on, along with coming to our house, saying he was tried of paying for the hotel and his wife was always home. WS said none of that really mattered. She shouldn‚Äôt have let it start in the first place and should have the courage to end it despite his threats and gone to HR no matter the cost. My hatred for POS went up by 100. I got up and called my, our lawyer and told her she needed to get over here right now. She wondered why. I just told her where we were and she needs to get here ASAP. Got back to table and OBS was talking. How she really wanted to keep hating WS, but couldn‚Äôt bring herself to do that. That POS is really just a con man with women, starting with OBS. She thought they were a great couple in a great marriage. Now she realizes she was just a vessel for him to produce children, cook and clean and the woman he would screw when no one else was available. Then she told WS that POS must have been shoveling a lot of bs that she fell for, for WS to throw away the life she had built with me. WS told that she now knows why she fell for it, but it‚Äôs still no excuse. She should have been smart enough, strong enough to not go down this road and hurt so many people. OBS told her not to be so hard on herself, that she was just next, and if it hadn‚Äôt been her it would have been some other woman. WS said, but is WAS her and because she let it happen, she‚Äôs destroyed her family and hurt the people closest to her. They keep talking till lawyer arrives. I look at WS and tell her she needs to tell lawyer what she said earlier. I get everyone more coffee and have to leave for work. Lawyer left 2 messages today but haven‚Äôt had time to call her back. I‚Äôll call her tomorrow. MC tomorrow should be very interesting.

**Mon Mar 22 2021**

Finally, some good news. Business not personal but any sun shining on me is good right now. On Friday I was contacted by on home builder that I had been trying to land a contract with that they have chosen my company as the landscaping contractor for a subdivision where they are building high end homes on minimum 3/4acre lots. Can‚Äôt tell you how happy that made me.

The kids and I went to WS‚Äôs place Saturday to talk. It went about how you would think it would. Very emotional and a lot of angry venting. Our daughter went off on her pretty good, I had to cut her off a few times. Each time WS stopped me and said she needed to say everything that was on her mind and that she,WS, deserves all of it for what she has put our family through. They were both in tears by the time she was done. Son took his turn, not as angry, I think because he has talked to his mom since DDay. Our daughter hasn‚Äôt spoken to WS since DDay, 7 weeks ago.

Have to get back to work. POS‚Äôs world is going to come crashing down this afternoon.

***Tue Mar 23 2021***¬†

Ok, so here it is. POS got scorched this afternoon. I‚Äôm retelling some of what was told me by my/our lawyer and OBS. Earlier in the afternoon shark lawyer,SL from now on, made whatever filings she had to make at county courthouse. Then she emailed the CEO and HR mangers of both company WS was at and his previous employer. Late in the afternoon she showed up at WS company with OBS and WS with her. Her assistant was also there. While SL and WSand OBS went to HR , SL‚Äôs assistant went to CEOs office to deliver hard copies of court filings. The three woman walked into HR manager‚Äôs office closed door and sat down. HR knows WS but SL introduced herself and OBS. Then proceeds to hand her copy of lawsuit naming company and POS in sexual harassment lawsuit. Included are sworn affidavits from WS and the next AP detailing POS behavior and abuse of power. HR manager has the typical corporate response of going to legal department etc. SL asks HR if she could escort her to POS‚Äôs office so she can deliver copy to him. Before they leave CEO bursts into office with papers in hand saying ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this about‚Äù. Realizes who else is in the office and mumbles excuse me. SL stands and introduces herself saying ‚Äú I think you know what this is about‚Äù. CEO looks at WS and asks ‚Äú Is this why you left‚Äù. SL cuts her off telling her not to answer. SL asks again to be escorted to POS‚Äôs office. CEO asks her to wait outside for a moment. OBS and WS leave and come to building lobby where I‚Äôm waiting with AP# 2 from old job. SL can hear HR manager and CEO talking in the office. After a few minutes they come out and tell SL to follow them. They arrive at POSs office and go inside. CEO tries to introduce SL but forgot her name so she introduces herself. Explains who she represents and starts with handing him divorce papers from OBS saying she is suing him for divorce for infidelity. Next comes papers naming him as co-defendant in sexual harassment lawsuit against him and the company. Then she hands him more papers naming him as co-dependent in sexual harassment lawsuit against him and former company. Finally she gives him papers saying she is seeking to re open the child support agreement between him and AP #2. Explains that AP #2 didn‚Äôt have proper legal representation and that any new child support claims would be going back to the beginning and seek to attach claim to any severance pay from company including current wages as well as his retirement benefits including but not limited to his 401k and any future employment. To say he was in total disbelief would be an understatement according to SL. All he could mumble out was something about what do you mean any future employment. CEO spoke and said that his employment with company was terminated effective immediately. He was to turn over keys, company phone and ID and leave immediately. Any personal items would be mailed to him. SL then asked CEO if he would sign documents along with HR manager as to both the company and POS being properly served legal papers. He agreed and asked HR manager to have security remove him from the building. SL left leaving a card with POS and telling him to have his lawyer contact her. She comes to lobby and meets me, AP # 2, WS and OBS. Only a few minutes pass when POS gets off elevator with security walking him out. The four of us start clapping as he is dejectedly walked past us. I fought the urge to say something. AP #2 couldn‚Äôt though and said karma is a bitch and so am I you asshole. After a few minutes goodbyes are said. AP #2 gives SL a huge hug thanking her saying she hasn‚Äôt felt that good in years. WS says goodbye and walks to elevator saying she‚Äôs going up to her old department. I‚Äôm a little confused, not idea what she going back there for. SL invites OBS and me out for dinner to discuss and fill in the gaps about what happened today. While at dinner she told OBS what most likely happen concerning divorce filing. I asked her about lawsuits moving forward and she politely told me she couldn‚Äôt discuss that with me since I‚Äôm not involved with those filings. We have a social dinner and go our separate ways. When I get home WS is waiting for me and asks if she can come in. Of course the whole kitchen, LR and DR are a mess from remodeling going on. She asks about it and I tell her which design I choose. We talk about that for a minute and head downstairs. This will only take a minute she says and goes on to tell me that she went up to her old department to tell the people she worked with what really happened and why she left. A few questions are asked about what happened in POS‚Äôs office and she fills them in as best she can. She gives me a hug and says she‚Äôll see herself out and that she‚Äôll see me at next MC. After she‚Äôs gone I went to the backyard and built a fire in the fire pit, went inside and grabbed my newest bottle of bourbon, Angels Envy, and a glass of ice. I sit by the fire enjoying a few glasses of bourbon on reflecting back on the past 7. 5 weeks. While I‚Äôm a long way from feeling normal getting that big contract, Saturday‚Äôs meeting as a family and today‚Äôs events have me feeling better than I have since before DDay. I cannot thank everyone here in this community enough for all the advice, support and encouragement I have received. It means more than I can ever say. Thanks again for everything.

P.S. I forgot to mention that while everything was going on with POS and that company, SL had her investigator deliver papers to POS‚Äôs previous employer.

***Mon Mar 29 2021***

Heard this song this morning at the gym working out. Helped me with perspective on where I‚Äôm at right now. Thought I would share and maybe help someone else.

I heard a song while working out today. I‚Äôm Alive by Kenny Chesney with Dave Mathews. If you‚Äôve never heard it, look it up. Starts out So damn easy to say that life‚Äôs so hard. Everybody‚Äôs got their share of battle scars. As for me I‚Äôd like to thank my lucky stars that I‚Äôm alive and well. It‚Äôd be easy to add up all the pain and all the dreams you sat watch go up in flames. Dwell on the wreckage as it smolders in the rain. But not me. I‚Äôm alive. Today that‚Äôs good enough for me, breathing in and out is a blessing don‚Äôt you see.....continues from there. I‚Äôm usually not one for that kind of thing but I like music. This really hit me for some reason. No matter what happens, I‚Äôm going to be ok. I‚Äôve been blessed with 2 great kids who love me, had a successful business that‚Äôs helped a lot of people have good jobs, hopefully will stay healthy and live a long life and have 29 years of good memories with WS. Whether I add on to those is still unknown but I‚Äôm not going to let that define how I live going forward.",1,1735156375.0,u_GentlemanlyAdvice,0,1.0,False

1hm7mgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFounders/comments/1hm7mgx/18yo_who_started_with_minecraft_now_running_a_4k/,"18yo who started with Minecraft, now running a $4K MRR SaaS - Here's my entire journey (no BS)","Hey everyone!

First time posting here. I wanted to share something real with you all. I'm 18, running a SaaS business with $4K MRR, and I want to tell you how I got here. Not to brag - seriously - but to show other young people that age is just a number, and we shouldn't let anyone tell us otherwise.

## The Minecraft Years (Where it all started)

This might sound crazy, but Minecraft literally changed my life. At 13, while other kids were just playing, I was obsessed with coding plugins. Every. Single. Night. Looking back, it was probably a bit much (sorry, mom!), but man, it taught me so much.

You know what's wild? I keep seeing successful tech people who started with Minecraft. It makes sense though - running a Minecraft server is basically running a mini-business:
- You need to manage moderation (customer support)
- Build a community (marketing)
- Work with other devs (team management)
- Keep players happy (user retention)

## The Coding Journey

That Minecraft obsession? It gave me this crazy problem-solving mindset. Everyone's bashing video games these days, but let's be real - gaming can literally launch your career if you approach it right.

I'm now a fullstack freelance developer. When I tell people my age, they usually don't believe it. But here's the thing - starting early with something you're passionate about is like a cheat code for life.

## Building My First SaaS (The Reality Check)

So, I built my SaaS in 3 weeks (yeah, I know, pretty fast). But then I had this ""oh crap"" moment: ""Wait... I can code, but how the hell do I get customers? Do I even know how to market this thing?""

Big reality check. 

Instead of panicking, I went full nerd mode on marketing books. Here's what I learned: Never limit yourself to what you already know. Your technical skills are just the beginning.

## The Marketing Hustle

You know what's funny? The whole idea started in a coffee shop. I was helping someone with their homework, and suddenly it hit me - the real problem wasn't with the students, it was with the entire educational system.

So I started investigating the schools' side of things. Man, that was a reality check. Getting through to decision-makers in education is TOUGH. These aren't your typical SaaS customers - they move slow, they're careful with change, and they have complex approval processes.

But instead of going for the hard sell, I tried something different. I booked a meeting with one school administrator. Just to listen. Turned out to be the best decision ever. Schools were drowning in administrative work that could easily be automated.

My approach shifted completely. Started super small. One school. Made sure every single feature solved a real problem they had. When it worked, they became my best case study.

Word spread in the education community. Other administrators started reaching out. Turns out schools talk to each other way more than I thought. Each new client helped refine the product further.

The business model clicked naturally - charging per student made sense to everyone. Schools get it, it scales with their size, and it's predictable for their budgets. That's how we reached ‚Ç¨4K MRR. Not by aggressive marketing, but by solving a real problem and letting the education community do the talking.

## The Customer-Obsessed Phase

Instead of going crazy with more marketing, I went ALL IN on making sure my first customer had the best experience possible. I:
- Reached out personally
- Collaborated on features
- Gave them 3 months free

Crazy? Maybe. But it worked. Not only did they stay, they started referring other customers.

## Real Talk

Look, I know this might sound like one of those ""success stories"" that make you roll your eyes. But I'm just a kid who:
- Coded way too much Minecraft
- Refused to believe age was a limit
- Worked his ass off
- Got lucky sometimes
- Failed a bunch
- Kept going anyway

If you take anything from this post: Don't let anyone tell you you're too young, too inexperienced, or that you should ""wait until you're older."" That's BS.

Just start building. Start learning. Start doing.

## What‚Äôs Next ?
Since you guys seemed interested - I'm actually working on some cool stuff:

Content-wise: If you found this helpful, I'm planning to share:
* My exact technical stack breakdown
* How I handle pricing (made so many mistakes here lol)
* The complete guide of my outreach strategy
* My daily routine and productivity system

Let me know in the comments what you'd want me to cover first! I'll prioritize based on what's most useful to you guys.

Also working on detailed guides about specific parts of my journey (especially the Minecraft to SaaS transition since many asked).

Not sure if it's useful, but happy to do a proper breakdown of any of these topics if there's interest!

Happy to answer any questions in the comments - and yes, I'll actually respond. Not going anywhere!",2,1735156271.0,TheFounders,0,1.0,False

Thanks to this group,"I‚Äôm (55F) house sitting in Oregon while going through divorce from wife of 23 years. I‚Äôm bi, touch starved and also hsv+.  I checked out PS first and thought screw that, I‚Äôm going on Tinder and at least practice disclosing hsv status. Found a great guy (56) who also happens to be hsv+. We‚Äôve been making out. Both of us went to PP last week and got tested for other stds. Planning to up our game on Friday and I am so ready. So I thought I was looking for a hookup and instead have a FWB. It‚Äôs been great for my self esteem as he is hot and can‚Äôt believe he lucked up and found me. Neither of us have had sex in 3+ years. I think we‚Äôre both getting spoiled because the apps aren‚Äôt usually this easy. I took safety precautions as I know hooking up can be sketchy. I snooped and found him in a local fb group so I was able to get his last name before we even met up for coffee and I was able to see that he was well regarded in the community and not a total nut. I literally scheduled an email to go out to a friend the next morning if I didn‚Äôt cancel it and told him about it which he totally respected. This will be my secret when I leave at the end of January as I‚Äôm not looking forward to coming out as bi to friends and family. 

I found some great disclosure scripts in this group that helped me be confident. Here‚Äôs the disclosure message I used ‚ÄúBefore we meet up I want to let you know that I take a daily antiviral for hsv. Everybody who‚Äôs ever even had a cold sore has hsv so it‚Äôs pretty common, but I want to be transparent early on in case it‚Äôs a deal breaker for you.‚Äù He responded with ‚Äúgreat communication, I‚Äôm hsv+ too!‚Äù

I have to admit that re PS, I did come across a guy who lives closer to my home base and I might meet up with him later. There‚Äôs also a couple courting me but I‚Äôm much more attracted to the woman and not sure I want to meet up with them. I am not ready to seriously date but now I know I don‚Äôt have to be ready for LTR to enjoy intimacy again.

If you got the reference In my post title, you can most likely skip straight to the Send Chat/DM step and Ignore the rest of this post, otherwise, read on, even If you didn't get the reference, It doesn't necessarily mean you are disqualified :P

I'm a gamer and I'm looking for someone with which I could share one of the biggest passions of my life with, along with every other facet of my life. I've often been described as Intelligent, caring, empathetic and laid back. I try not to take life too seriously, my humor Is often darker than my coffee, but I also know when to dial It down a notch or three. I'm also a great listener and If you ever need me, have no doubt that I'll be there and If I can't (life sucks that way sometimes), i'll make sure to make the time, because that's just the way I'am, I'll never be too busy for those I care about.

It's very likely that I have ADHD and that bleeds Into many aspects of my life, I tend to info dump sometimes (with consent) and I easily hyperfixate on things sometimes. As expected, that also comes with a side of depression and anxiety, but I'm in the process of managing It and making some drastic lifestyle changes, unless something serious Is going on, It's usually very manageable. With that said, mental health Is an extremely Important topic to me and It's very Important to me to feel safe and be able to communicate with you eventually, rest assured that I make the best effort to reciprocate this In kind, which you've probably realized by now.

As mentioned already, I'm a gamer and this Is the biggest passion I have In life and It's Important for me to be able to share this with someone If we're together. I want to hear what your favorite game growing up was, what your current favorite Is, what game had the best story for you and I will most likely want to play It If I haven't. It'd also be great If we could play co op games together, or even the occasional competitive game, though I'am pretty bad at anything PvP. That said, video games Isn't my entire personality and neither should It be yours, outside of the virtual realms, I enjoy playing Board Games and D&D, with the latter I used to play In a campaign and I also ran my own, but life has happened and I'm about to move to Oregon (hence, this post), so everything Is on pause, but I'll probably be picking up the DM hat again once I settle down, just transitioning everything online. I also enjoy hiking a lot and nature In general, which Is one of the many reasons I'm excited about moving to Oregon, I enjoy reading occasionally (mostly fantasy fiction) when my ADHD lets me concentrate on It, I don't want TV very often, but I do enjoy anime and a few TV shows every now and than, i also enjoy cooking and baking, I don't know that many recipes and I'm working on trying new things, but if we hit It off, I will 100% cook and bake for you occasionally!

As far as relationship goes, I like to spoil my partner when I date, one of my love languages Is physical touch/affection, so things like hand holding, hugs and physical affection In general are extremely Important to me. Communication Is also Important to me, I want those sweet good morning/good night texts, I want to hear about your day, the silly/goofy selfies and just In general whenever you think of me, because I tend to do the same. I don't mind LDRs, but I would like to limit them to within the US and obviously, If you're adverse to planning meeting up within a reasonable amount of time, this wouldn't work out long term. Finally, we all obviously have our preferences In terms of what we physically like In a partner, but personality Is of much higher Importance to me.

However, the calorie estimates are insanely high. For instance, on a day where I drove and walked around the house a bit it clocked in at 3235 kcal, with 1600kcal active calories...

I am thinking because of my poor health that my heart rate easily bumps into the \*active\* zones, so that active calories are counted even when I'm simply stressed or climbing up and down stairs for instance... I'd say even a couple cups of coffee is likely enough to throw me over the edge... during wake and restfulness my RHR looks to be about 90 or so, but average heart rate is sitting at 69?? I have switched my zone estimates to HRR today to try and make it more personalised, hopefully will see an appropriate adjustment.

Would anyone know if there is a useful way to correct for this? Should I make manual adjustments to my resting heart rate, heart rate zones etc...??? What would your thoughts be? I'm thinking garmins proprietary calculator is more guided towards athletes than chubby lads like me...

I'm not confident in its ability to calculate calories burnt etc... when its this far off already. There doesnt seem to be any way to include body fat percentage either, which I would have thought would have been something incredibly basic to have. I have a weighing scales that outputs this information, would there be any way to integrate it? I've yet to get VO2 max etc... set up or input, could this be a contributing factor?

I also wanted to ask about MFP integration, I'd love to be able to quickly check my watch to see how many calories I've logged in MFP, but I can't seem to do this.

I have two calorie measures, one of which gives the active and resting calorie burn, the other I'm not sure yet (I'm yet to log an exercise session, plan to go for a couple lengths in the pool tomorrow), so I think this may only log exercise events, but I'm hoping that it links with MFP better. It would be really great to be able to glance at my watch and get an idea of how much I've ate, or how much is left of my budget for when I need to quickly check whether I can have something somewhat sweet, or whether I need to get a salad! Would be great for those of us who don't have an innate fullness meter etc...

Any help on this is much appreciated. Cheers.",1,1735156100.0,Garmin,0,1.0,False

But I knew I wasn't staying in the apartment miserable. I don't really have a family. My mother was abusive and I had to cut contact with that entire side of my family when I was 15, because they're all pretty narcissistic. My father was an alcoholic and drank himself to death and I never met anyone else on his side, as most of them were already dead by the time I met him. Decided to go for a drive and ended up 3 hours away. Along the way, I stopped at a gas station. Picked up some coffee. Got $10 cashback. Told the cashier to keep it, merry Christmas. And then again. And again. Buying something random, getting $10 cb, and giving it to the cashier. Ended up giving 5 people $10 this way. The thought being, I'd be working on Christmas if I could, because I don't have a family to spend it with anyway. These people who are working on Christmas most likely don't have a family or have no choice but to work instead of spending time with their family. Every single one of them, you could tell it really made their day brighter. And it honestly made my day brighter, too, just knowing I put a smile on someone's face. The last one really got me. You could hear it in her voice that she wasn't having a good day. Pretty sure I left her speechless. She just whispered, ""nice"".

I put a yearly reminder in my phone. I'm gonna do this every year from now on. Nothing major. Just 10 bucks. But none of these people are expecting it, which makes it all the more impactful. And the world really needs more kindness, these days. And I genuinely hope, when people see me doing this, it encourages them to do the same.",45,1735156048.0,randomactsofkindness,6,1.0,False

1hm7hv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hm7hv3/i_think_i_like_my_girl_best_friend_more_than_a/,I think I like my girl best friend more than a friend,"Hey y‚Äôall! Hoping to get some advice/insight on this situation I‚Äôm in as I continue to get mixed signals, leading me to honestly feel so lost in all this.

So I (27M) have this friend, let‚Äôs call her Patty (25F). We‚Äôve known each other almost our whole lives (we‚Äôre both of the same ethnicity so we‚Äôve always had mutual family friends). Throughout our lives we were never really friends, not for any particular reason, we knew each other but just never got to actually know each other. 

About two years ago, I happened to meet her cousin in law, let‚Äôs call her Kat, through this company i worked for at the time. Kat and I hit it off and became close friends very quickly. Kat would invite me to her family functions, kids‚Äô bday parties, Christmas parties, etc. Of course Patty and the rest of her family (she has a pretty big family) would always be there.

About a year in, Kat helped her cousin Patty get a job at the company, and that‚Äôs when we started to really see each other often and actually get to know each other more. We became basically work best friends, and began to hang out and talk more outside of work, however it was not anything too significant at the time. Nothing flirty or anything of that manner.

Also, for some backstory, between 2018 through summer of 2024, I was in a LTR. So honestly, when me and Patty started to work together and become closer and closer of friends, I never saw her in a romantic way like that. For one, I was in a devoted relationship and am not the type to cheat. Additionally, I don‚Äôt feel like I was ever attracted to Patty at the time. I mean sure she‚Äôs an attractive woman, but I never really looked at her in that way.

After about a year of working together, I ended up moving to another company. Patty and I kept in touch but would not really see each other or talk to each other regularly. I was still in a relationship, so I never had any feeling or urge to constantly reach out or see her. And although we were very good friends, I haven‚Äôt always been the best at staying in touch with all my friends especially over the course of time during my relationship. 

To add some more details, I‚Äôve been dealing with a pretty serious chronic medical condition over the last 6 years of my life. Although Patty and I hadn‚Äôt been seeing each other much after leaving my last job, she would consistently do things to support me and show me she cared about me and my health. She would bring me supplements, food, and just little gifts to uplift my spirits. She also would consistently try to get through to me spiritually and bring me closer to god, who my relationship with has been strained for quite a while now. She‚Äôs been very much a rock for me over this past year. She‚Äôs very grounded and it‚Äôs refreshing. I feel that my life has been in shambles and she tends to help me feel more put together I guess. I truly admire her and her character.

This year, Patty and I have been a lot closer. We started talking and seeing each other more often towards the beginning of the year. We‚Äôd hang out maybe once every 2 months for the first half of 2024. Which was more than we really would before.

This past July, my ex and I broke up, and within the same 2 weeks, Patty and a guy she was talking to at the time called it quits. We were there for each other, as a shoulder to lean/cry on. We started seeing each other even more often then. It became more like once a week or every other week. At first it was constantly talking about our relationship trauma. But those scars inevitably healed and we would just find ourselves hanging out to just hang out n be around each other.

Her bday was a few months ago, and she even texted me at midnight while I was out of the country at the time to tell me to call her so i could be the first to wish her a happy birthday. We would go to coffee shops often to work, and she would consistently refer to them as ‚Äúcafe dates.‚Äù She constantly invites me to her family outings, where I‚Äôm the only non-family there. When we hang out, I find that we‚Äôre always physically very close. Nothing in that sense has happened at all, but there‚Äôs definitely a level of comfortability there where I can touch her arm/leg or her hair without there being anything odd about it. She even came over last week and stayed up super late with me 2 nights in a row, sitting super close and watching movies together.

I‚Äôve tried to be subtly flirty many times but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just terrible at flirting now or if she just doesn‚Äôt acknowledge it as that. I try to compliment her quite often, every time I see her I‚Äôll always comment on something about her outfit or hair or whatever. But idk, I feel like it feels a bit forced. I also am a textbook over thinker, so that never helps what‚Äôs going through my head.

My friends, coworkers, family, and therapist all think that I have developed these more intimate feelings towards her. They also think that she has some level of interest as well. I just don‚Äôt know if I see it. They seem to be so confident that she‚Äôs interested in me given the way our friendship has been over the last few months, but something tells me it‚Äôs not exactly like that. 

A few weeks ago when we were hanging out, she even asked me for help transferring some photos from her phone to laptop. Come to find out that this album she was transferring was full of old pictures and videos of her and her exes. I seen the album as I was helping her and it honestly really turned me off and kindve annoyed me a bit. That‚Äôs when I knew that I was really feeling these feelings for her. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something like that is something you‚Äôd show a ‚Äúgay best friend.‚Äù I feel like if she saw me in any romantic way, that might not be something to show me.

Idk I feel like I‚Äôm rambling here and idk if it even all makes sense. My feelings are just so conflicted and it‚Äôs been shitty. My therapist thinks I should just be straight with her, but I feel like I‚Äôm scared of the result. I genuinely care about her so much and she makes me happy, but idk if I could stay a friend to her. But I also don‚Äôt want to lose her.",1,1735155870.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

His anxieties and reactions mean that I frequently don't get my own needs met and he is resistant to individual therapy. How can I approach things with him?

TL;BIWR (but I want to read):

I (38M) am having pretty severe relationship troubles with my (41M) partner of 4.5 years. I am looking for some advice about what I can do (if anything) to make my partner be more thoughtful and, well, emotionally grown up. We have been in couple's therapy 2 months, after months of me begging him to go and finally giving an ultimatum after several nasty fights. On top of this, we are in a cross-national relationship: we met while we were both abroad, and after he moved back, we spent some years where we mostly took holidays together, or visited one another for some weeks at a time. Six months ago I moved to his country, where I am working remotely and trying to learn the language (which is known to be difficult, I am A1; he is highly fluent in English). I am here legally, while waiting on the government to process my application. However, problems have followed.

The short of it is that I do not feel like he takes me into consideration in his life and while we have a relationship, I do not feel like a partner. This feeling of distance has led to a lot of fights. He has VERY strict expectations in life and gets angry and sulky when they're not met, something which he has only recently acknowledged in our couple's therapy. This was not the case when we met, or was much less the case, but it has gotten worse over time. Some examples of things that induce anger/frustration in him:

\- He has a bad day at work

\- When he comes home, I have to judge if it was good or bad, and that sets the mood for the whole rest of the evening, and he will complain about it most of the day. He hates his job, and I have asked for two years for him to look into finding a different one but he insists it is impossible and has gotten angry at me for bringing it up and being naive, so I've stopped asking him to.

\- He has had to do cleaning or other chores

\- He is not-quite-OCD but has very strict standards for himself in keeping his place clean. I am much more comfortable with mess, but have tried to adopt his standards. But this means he spends lots of extra time cleaning and straightening things up which are not strictly necessary, and then he complains about it

\- A plane/train/bus is late.

\- He has to have a list of at least 2 backup plans for every travel itinerary. Once we were flying to a small island together and the plane was delayed eight hours. It was unpleasant, but he had a full meltdown in the airport, hyperventilating, calling and yelling at the airlines, and got upset at me for trying to calm him down.

\- I do not remember the vocabulary item in his language that he has told me before.

\- I brought up recently in therapy that I have in the past NOT wanted to study his native language with him because he has very unreasonable expectations for me and gets frustrated when I don't meet them, which makes it hard for me to feel secure in messing up. (He speaks 4 languages fluently and thinks it should be all easy/obvious.) He acknowledged this dynamic has been a problem.

\- I did not make his coffee at the right time

\- This in fact precipitated a near-breakup fight: I was trying to anticipate when he would wake up, so his coffee would be hot for him. He was up earlier than I expected, and bitched about how he can never have anything nice in life. I was hurt, and reacted, saying he makes me feel like I can never do anything acceptable, and I had it all ready but wanted it hot for him. Then I was criticized for not appropriately predicting his wakeup time. I got pulled into the argument and was very upset, he told me ""fuck you"".

\- I am walking slower than he is

\- This is a constant issue: He nearly runs everywhere he goes, I like to enjoy things (I am actually slightly taller than him). We went on a ferry trip for his birthday, and we were an over an hour and a half early for the boat. He was ""trying to be on time"" and my legs were sore from the gym. He got upset and, without saying anything, ran ahead of me to the boat, which he arrived at 3 minutes before I did. Later I told him I felt abandoned and it was a mean thing to do. He told me I could walk at his speed. In therapy when he recounted the story, I interjected with ""We were over an hour early"" and he shut down because I was ""invalidating his emotions, as typical.""

\- I am sick

\- Another vacation (after I came to live here), I got COVID a few days before we left. He had a nervous breakdown that the whole vacation was ruined and we were out all this money. I told him at the worst case he could go ahead of me and I could join later (I make more money than him), but was told off for suggesting it, as he would be worried the whole time. I have to end up comforting HIM while I am feeling very unwell.

\- I say I want kids

\- I communicated this early in the relationship, but said it may never happen at this point and that makes me sad. Later on, about a year ago, I told him I'd been thinking about it a lot and still want it. He freaks out, asks if I am breaking up with him, and I have to comfort him that I'm not dumping him. My needs are never met and he doesn't bring it up. The one time I try to bring this topic up again his defenses go up. He says he used to really want this, but doesn't now. The most I've gotten out of him is he thinks he wouldn't be a good dad. At this point, I agree. I've brought this up in therapy as an instance of my needs always being subsumed to his immediate anxieties.

I've thought a lot about what is going on with him. One thing is an undiagnosed anxiety disorder, which I am 100% sure he has. Many ordinary things can send him into unmanageable anxiety spirals - again, something that's worsened with time. I've told him this, and even wondered if he is depressed (irritability is one symptom), but he refuses to deal with it either on the grounds of (1) he doesn't have what I claim (he's not ""crazy""), (2) it's a personality issue and therefore unresolvable. Though I have gotten him to go to couple's therapy, which is perhaps a start, but I don't know. I've tried to talk to him about the sessions outside of therapy, and he has said he doesn't have opinions or doesn't think about them, ""I live in the moment."" He forgets week-to-week what we discuss, and I'm not seeing any changes. He seems to think if we haven't had a fight we're doing fine, but I still feel as distant as ever. I've told him before I feel like furniture rather than a partner, but he looks at me as if I am speaking Swahili.

Another thing I think is happening is he is just incapable, somehow, of understanding that my point of view and experiences are not his. This is the case with his obsession with walking fast (why am I so slow? I must be doing it to be mean), or just on Christmas, I got him a book he asked for, and for one hour (!) he was reading to me out of it multiple times per page, asking what I thought, while I was playing my new game. After an hour of it I went and kissed him and said I love you, and I'm happy to discuss it with you, but if I want to read the book I will do it on my own. Can you read it out to me a little less, I feel like I've gotten every page since you started. He put the book down and went off to sulk. I think his mental process is ""I'm interested in this and engaged, therefore he is too."" He seems to struggle to understand that I may be doing my own thing, or may not have the same experience right this moment. Many such examples.

I do love him, which is why I've stayed and tried to make this work. Posts like this necessarily always focus on the bad, but there's many good:

\- He is a wonderful cook and really loves to prepare things that are delicious and suit my highly finnicky and sensitive digestion.

\- He shares a love for travel and going to new places, learning the local culture and language

\- He has invited me to be with his family during holidays (my own story with my family isn't great, and I have a strained relationship)

\- When he's in a good mood, he can be very loving and sweet

However, the negatives can be very negative, and the ""good mood"" as a precondition is not something I saw so clearly earlier on in the relationship. If any of these descriptions resonate with others' experiences, I'd like to hear from you. I decided a while ago to have an assessment after the holidays with him, because we agreed to therapy at least until the new year, and I don't feel like there's been much progress, and I still feel further and further away I don't want to throw things away without trying, but I feel like I am bearing ALL the emotional labor in this relationship, and he doesn't even recognize that I am. There's been one situation in therapy where he's been shocked to realize that I've changed certain behavior to accommodate him: but in fact I'm doing this all the time, and feel like I get not much in return. What is the best way for me to approach this, assuming I want to save the relationship?",2,1735155289.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

We have been terrified of losing her, which I think is part of what made us so scared to admit anything was wrong. So I'm in a lot of tears.

I don't know what this would even be labelled under, perhaps just something I need to get off my chest until I can see my psychologist next week?  
It's hard to explain the situation I'm in without a little bit of background information but I will try to keep it brief... but brief will still be long...  
Me (38M) and my husband Michael (38M) have been ""together"" since we were 14 but had been friends throughout our whole school life up until that point.  
Not long after turning 15, Michael made the decision to come out to his parents and told them about how he was dating me.   
Being religious they didn't take it well and he was forced out of their home, cut off and then they proceeded to ban all of their family, extended and otherwise from contacting him which broke his heart, and caused him years of counselling even up to this day.  
With Michael having nowhere else to go I asked my parents if he could stay with us, and they agreed, my mother eventually having a laugh to herself when she caught me and him sleeping in the same bed one morning...  
  
My grandfather and in turn my own father have always had a rule that the sons of the family would need to learn a trade and seeing as my older brother at the time, we'll call him Dean(42M now) had refused to follow this expectation, Dad moved onto me, expecting me to leave school at 16 and take on an apprenticeship as a carpenter under him.  
I didn't like school as I wasn't any good at it but I also wasn't interested in building but thankfully Michael who Dad had quickly accepted as his son was, and my father was only too happy to take him on as his apprentice, leaving me to pick up the trades of tiling and once I finished that I moved onto carpet laying/flooring etc.  
Fast forward to around 21 years old, I'd finished my tiling apprenticeship but Michael was still ongoing as he'd become more of a jack of all trades at this point with building being his main interest.   
My mother went to the doctors due to feeling a little under the weather and after some tests, was informed that she was terminal with breast cancer, two months later after going down hill rapidly we lost her, it was quite the shock and I didn't actually mourn her passing until about a month later when it finally managed to sink in...  
By this point her and my father had made the decision to mutually separate due to feeling that they were just friends living together not lovers anymore.   
The house which she, me and Michael still shared, had belonged to my father who'd given it unprotested to my mother during their very friendly and understanding divorce but the stipulation he placed upon that was that she was to leave it to me if anything happened to her as Dean by that point had gone through a tough spell (drugs, alcohol, 3 kids to different mothers and was also unemployed and not speaking to any of us after a blow up after he'd been arrested for stealing for the umpteenth time).  
Me and Michael lived in the house for about a year.  
Michael had finished learning from my dad and mentioned to me about wanting to take the risk of starting his own business but how he also didn't want to steal customers away from my dad and the tradesmen who'd trained us both by doing so.  
After much heartache and thought, I decided to sell my home which Michael argued against the idea of but in the end it was my idea and my decision to make as even though she was gone, it didn't feel like my house and I still believe to this day that it never would have as it held too many memories, happy memories but memories which kept me from moving on emotionally all the same.  
We moved to a city four hours away, and I invested every cent into purchasing the tools we needed and giving us a chance of competing with the already established builders/ tradesmen and companies in the area.  
We lived off rice and potatoes for a long time, with every spare cent going back into the business.  
Michael and I both took on everything we could, small frustrating projects which the local builders didn't want.  
I even took on work from the local carpet court and tiling places but eventually we got our name out there and were earning enough for us to take on larger projects.  
After that it was like a whirlwind, we had more work coming in than we could handle and we decided to take the risk of putting on contractors, then full time employees and eventually our own apprentices seeing as our business was then able to take on multiple projects at once and some really big and profitable ones at that.  
Being stupid and pushing myself beyond what I could reasonably expect of myself, I ended up doing my right knee in and settled into doing some admin, marketing, bookwork etc for a spell while recovering, which we'd been paying people to do for us as neither of us were good at school stuff hence why we left at 16.  
However, after realising we were saving more money by having me off the tools and doing that instead, I decided to do some courses and take it up full time and have been trapped in the office ever since.  
Seeing as we (around 28 at the time) were eventually taking on a share of the nearby high school's leavers either as labourers or apprentices, as we'd expanded into prefabricated housing and frames as well, we ended up having their headmaster coming to us and asking if we'd like to do a speech for something which I can't recall the name of, but it involved a lot of speakers from universities, colleges etc doing speeches about what would be available for these soon to be high school graduates to consider after school.   
It was also a chance for us to promote the vacant and upcoming positions to the students at the same time so while I was keen on the idea of grabbing up some good potential workers, I'm not a public speaker, never have been so Michael very reluctantly took it up instead.  
This is where things got complicated for us again, as one of the students who'd travelled from our old home town with their school for this event turned out to be one of his nephews.  
Michael, being the ever vocal gloater about how well we'd been doing had mentioned how much turnover we had in his speech, which even at that point we were substantial, but I must add that those liquid funds were ours as well as the company's for future projects as I have always kept the stance that we never borrow money for projects under any circumstances as I hate the idea of going into debt, so while we were considered wealthy at that point with what we had at our disposal, it wasn't exactly money we could go tossing around and misusing as it was also complicated tax wise.  
This inevitably got back to his parents and wouldn't you know it? They reached out.  
Michael is a big, furry, scary looking fella when you first meet him, he's literally 6 foot 8 and built like a brick outhouse, but he's a big emotional sook that wears his heart on his sleeve, so when he heard his mother's voice over the phone he melted like the Wicked Witch.  
I won't lie, I wanted to grab the phone off him, tell her what I thought of her and hang it up but he was happier for having spoken to her after more than 14 years so all I said to him was ""Leave me out of it, cos I won't pretend to be nice to them"" and he was happy with that.  
The sob stories started shortly after, his parent's home needed a new tiled roof, we organised to have it replaced, then the bathroom... then the kitchen, a back entertainment area, a shed and the list goes on and on...  
His older brother's house was an old cheap weatherboard rundown in need of some serious work and repairs, Michael went up to ""look at"" to see what he had on his plate and ended up coming home and taking back with him a brand new kitchen/bathroom/ducted air con system and a truck's worth of trusses and timber framing we'd had stored due to customer cancellations etc, and installed and done the repairs for him all free of charge.  
He did similar work for his sisters as well and I too on occasion have caved into helping out the nieces and nephews with new computers for school work... or a gaming machine, a musical instrument! And games etc but I don't mind cos they're mainly all pretty polite and respectful.  
I will say that Michael has never handed money over to them though, not a cent, he's happy to help out but on the many occasions they've asked for money he has outright told them no.  
When debt has been an issue we have helped but when we've been guilted into it, we've chosen to speak directly to the lenders about the situation as we've both learned to be careful about handing over money due to Dean's antics while he was using.  
And on the occasions where he wasn't keen on handing over the sums of money being asked for, we agreed on him using me as the excuse not to as I am still the majority owner of our company (It's both of ours and I don't actually see it that way but it's just a convenient excuse even though it turns me into the bad guy (which I am, cos I hate them and I don't care about them for any other reason other than for the fact that Michael does).  
Now to 2021-2022.  
Everything had stopped for the first time since we'd started, we'd not had holidays or more than a day off at most since starting our new business, and while some people curse that time, it was a good wake-up call for us as we hadn't realised how physically and emotionally exhausted we'd become until then and we greatly enjoyed reconnecting, playing video games, card games, watching TV and doing stuff around the house together.  
So when we ended up going back to work after it had all settled down, it was hard to get back into it.  
At the start of last year Michael admitted to me that he had started to have what he called ""dark thoughts"".  
I tried my best not to show it but I panicked, full on panicked as we've had perfectly happy, healthy workers and friends end it all seemingly out of the blue without even hinting at having problems.  
I even happened upon one myself just hanging from a tree out the back of his garage after going to check up on him after he hadn't come into work or answered his phone for a few days, he was a good fellow, happy, no issues to speak of, so for Michael to say that to me?  
I forced him into counselling, began taking his lunches and coffees to him every day to ensure that he was taking his breaks.  
I also ordered those that were working with him to send him home on time, no excuses, instead of allowing him to work the sometimes 70+ hours he'd usually work a week, but no matter how happy he looked and seemed, I couldn't rest or relax.  
I have difficulty sleeping, and often wake up just to keep an eye on him during the night cos of nightmares where I wake up and am unable to find him or where I do find him but he's hanging from that same damned tree or I've visited his grave or standing over a coffin with him in it... I know this is unhealthy and I am speaking to a psychologist about it but while I am talking to someone it doesn't seem to help either.  
However, I've never told Michael about these dreams or how I'm anxious all of the time when I'm away from him because I don't want to upset him further or make him feel guilty... he gets enough of that from his mother...  
And while I've tried to do everything that the psychologist has suggested that I do to help him through his problems, Michael goes right back to that same despicable, horrible person and she smacks him right back down into the dirt.  
As for my actions around his working situation, he eventually admitted to me that he felt bad cos I was still working the long hours and he wasn't, so I eventually caved into finding myself someone to start taking over what I do so I could spend more time with him at home and finally, we've managed to get our teams to a point where they no longer need us all of the time.  
I even booked us a holiday which is meant to start in January, nothing fancy, nothing active and sight seeing etc its just an isolated retreat with hot springs and nature walks cos that's what I feel we both need, another chance to just stop.  
The problem again...  
His mother!  
We got a call about a month ago, she was beside herself to the point that I could hear her howling over the phone to Michael.  
Her house had practically slumped to one side and split in two with the kitchen/lounge areas being the section which had sunk.  
Michael and I were busy and couldn't get up there right away, to which she guilt tripped him over to the point that after he'd finished on the worksite he drove the full four hours up there to take a look for her (without telling me mind you).  
The piers beneath the house had been undermined by water, a lot of it, so it was flood damage.  
Unfortunately, to save money and seeing as she was on the side of a hill and nowhere near water, she'd forgone flood damage on her house insurance, and they quickly knocked her back on coverage.  
Michael promised to help but explained to her that we wouldn't be able to help for a while, we have the equipment needed to jack up houses to restore the piers beneath but all 6 of them are booked back to back with them only ever sitting idle in the yard when needing repairs or a service.  
Michael tried to explain this to his mother but she continued to guilt trip him, as he'd ""promised to do all he could to help"" which made him feel terrible and depressed, causing him to lose sleep again, as well as me.  
We have a big home, no we don't need it but it's a period style house that I fell in love with despite it being in terrible repair and we've restored it right down to pretty much the mortar itself, so when she demanded, not asked! Demanded! For us to take her in until her house could be fixed, I refused, and it wasn't because of her demanding entitled tone alone but because of the stress she puts on Michael constantly.  
She speaks to him like garbage, lectures him on his soul and how he's going to hell, not only that but she also has four cats and 6 large dogs which live inside and her home is literally covered in cat and god hair and the smell... is something else.  
The cats are toilet trained but they rip her furniture to pieces despite having scratching posts and she does nothing to try and deter them beyond providing those, and the dogs literally park themselves anywhere and drop out their insides at a whim, so no, I wasn't going to have that at my house! But I did offer an olive branch which was to allow her and Michael's father to stay as long as they promised that the animals would not be let into the house, which caused an argument which while eventually ended with her agreeing to the terms, left me suspicious that it wouldn't be adhered to, so I then decided that I didn't want the animals anywhere near my home at all, so I instead made it clear that they'd need to go to another family member's place for housing or a boarding kennel until their house was liveable again, but she outright refused this offer or to budge so so did I (and I now have the honoured title of ""worst, heartless person in the world who will one day burn in hell for blah blah blah and the rest"" and I wear it proudly).  
Wanting the drama to stop asap for Michael's sake, I began to move and shift things around to try and get one of the house jacks free to get it done and out of the way but all I managed to snag up was a four day window which would have been during our holiday, so I turned to our workers for assistance.  
I told them what was going on, I tried to be nice about the situation but my face speaks the language of my soul without meaning to...  
However I managed to get a large group of them interested... by offering pay at public holiday rates, travel, hotels, drinks and all of their meals for them to travel to my MIL's hometown to jack up the house, reset the piers and repair the damage to the frame, kitchen etc.  
It was a very big job to get done and I really didn't think they had a chance of doing it all but as long as they got those piers done the rest could wait.  
The main issue is, that when I told Michael of this, he delightfully took the good news to his mother, who had another emotional break down over the phone to him, all because he wouldn't be the one doing the work as the four day gap I managed to grab up is during our holiday and after he'd tried to explain this to her she ended up hanging up on him, another one of her manipulation tactics if you ask me, cos she does this all of the time and then she went out of her way to drive all the way to our home to confront him before we went to work the next day having ignored his calls the previous one which again, he lost sleep over.  
Of course she used the fact that she'd taken the time to get his father to drive her here as an added bargaining chip for him to cave into giving up our holiday to be there and make sure her house was repaired properly by our ""yahoo builders""...  
I couldn't help but let out an annoyed snort as I watched her trying on her bs right at our front door and I whirled around to go back into the kitchen because I didn't want my face telling her the things I felt she needed to hear, but I made sure to remain in earshot at the same time.  
I can't recall the exact wording but it went along the lines of,  
""Do you like breaking my heart? Is this a punishment for trying to save you all of those years ago? You've always been a selfish little pig, first you bring shame upon us all by damning your soul to hell for eternity by picking up with that little (won't repeat it), then you turn into a disgusting fat glutton (a go at his weight, he isn't fat, just big cos of some padding over a lot of muscle and she's far fatter than him anyway!) and then you decide to be greedy with your money... I've never been so ashamed of anyone in my life! I'm glad we wrote you out of the will! Maybe a few more years of silence from us will teach you the lesson you need to learn, I might even die from a broken heart during that time, that'll teach you!""  
I have said very few things to my MIL but upon hearing this, I lost my ability to hold my tongue completely.  
""Get out"" It was flat and cold.  
""This is my son's house, you have no right to tell me...""  
""Get out, get the fuck out, get out of my house you nasty old bitch and don't you ever come back. And fuck your house, fix it your fucking self!""  
I am not a very big man, I'm more than a foot shorter than Michael and only weigh around 50 kgs on my best weeks but according to those that I've had words with I can be pretty scary when I lose my temper.  
She stood there like a Pez dispenser, her mouth moving but not saying anything, Michael was completely silent, his head bowed as he stepped off to the side and away from the doorway.  
I boggled my eyes at her as I marched toward the door, throwing up my hands with a shrug.  
""You deaf or just stupid? Fuck off!""  
""You little beast, don't you dare...""  
""Yeah, yeah, whatever, goodbye"" I slammed the door in her face and turned to glare up at my husband.  
""I hate to do this Michael, but I don't have the energy to keep lifting you up every time she knocks you down, so you need to make a choice here. Either you can cancel our holiday and go up with the team to fix her ungrateful ass's house or you can allow me to cancel the work and come on holiday with me... either way I'm done with having her involved with any part of my life, and that includes my husband's, so if you want to remain in touch with her, go ahead but this a choice between your mother or me...""

This happened last week and its the very first time I've ever spoken to him like that, and it hurt.  
I know I should have been gentler and not made that kind of demand of him, but I'm exhausted...  
I worry about him all of the time and here I am awake at 5am and petrified to go to sleep, because I fear I've upset him enough to push him over the edge.  
He chose me and chose to cancel the work on his mother's house himself, but I don't feel like I acted in his best interest, only mine.  
All it's done is place a heavier weight upon my chest as I fear he'll come to despise or hate me for making him make that decision... but she isn't good for him, but I feel it also wasn't my place to make that choice for him and to instead support him until he could see that for himself but I also feel like I don't have that emotional strength to properly support him through those bitter ups and downs anymore...",1,1735155028.0,u_Waltz-428,0,1.0,False

DDay was 10 days ago 1/29, I won‚Äôt forget that day now either cause of the day after, our anniversary. Since then I have been reading a lot of posts on this sub. It has been helpful to know I‚Äôm not the only one. Now I thinking posting what happened will help me out. It‚Äôs going to be long cause I think details matter and I‚Äôve been playing it over and over in my head everyday.

Our story. Been with my wife 29 years, married 26. I‚Äôm 51M, her 49 F. Two grown kids 24S, 22D. Meet in college, dated, feel in love, married, and thought what I believed was a great marriage. Did a lot of things together, talked all the time, communicated about things that were troublesome, both of us had successful careers that we both supported each other in along the way, great love life, maybe not as often as when we were younger, but just as passionate. She‚Äôs in IT and I own a small landscaping company that employees 75 people that I started after graduation. She‚Äôs been working from home a lot since COVID and we have been talking about my easing out of the day to day operations and her going part-time so we can spend more time together and travel etc now that the kids are established. Looking back there were NO red flags that I‚Äôve read so much about. No weird texting, no guarding her phone, no clothing changes, no unusual behavior, no nights out with people from work. When she did go out it was friends and family andI always heard from someone the next day how I should have come, but I wanted her to go out without me and I enjoying being by myself doing stuff in my shop. She always was home early. To say I was blind sided is an understatement.

DDay‚Äî-The week before I had booked a weekend at a romantic bed n breakfast owned by some friends(our state is open). Winter festival was that weekend. I leave work early to surprise her and tell her to pack a bag we‚Äôre going away for our anniversary. I pull my truck in the driveway and find a strange car there. Right away, I just knew, don‚Äôt know why, but I did. I‚Äôm hoping and praying I‚Äôm wrong but my gut is telling I‚Äôm not. I sit there awhile wondering what to do, leave and talk to her later, leave and pretend I didn‚Äôt see it...not sure what to do. I‚Äôm shaking so bad I can‚Äôt see straight. When I have something at work I have to do that might be uncomfortable I always tell myself, Man up, get this over with. Suddenly, shaking stops and feel very calm, no idea how, cause inside I‚Äôm a wreck. I sneak in the back door and my black lab is laying there with a sad face, like he knows, instead of jumping on me. Man I love that dog. He stays as i quietly go up the stairs. When I get upstairs I can hear what is going on in OUR bedroom. I get to the door and open it and see her boss on top of my wife. I stand there for a second and yell out SURPRISE!!! The shit show that followed would be laughable if it didn‚Äôt hurt so much. He rolls off trying to get out of bed but he gets tangled up in the sheets. My wife is screaming OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG and trying to cover up but can‚Äôt cause he‚Äôs still tangled up. He finally gets out and starts looking for his clothes only their on the other side of the bed. This just hit me, in about the same spot where mine used to end up. Don‚Äôt know why, but I beat him to them and grab them. My wife is crying, I‚Äôm so sorry, over and over. I back up to the door and stand there and he‚Äôs standing next to the bed naked. I grab the big easy chair out of the corner and pull it to the door and sit down. He asks for his clothes and I say no and toss him my wife‚Äôs robe from the back of the door. He starts to walk towards me. Now, even though I‚Äôm 51, I‚Äôm in good shape. 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 240. Years of going to the gym and working in landscaping have seen to that. I look at him and say ‚Äúif you get any closer its not going to end well for either of us. You‚Äôll be in the hospital and I‚Äôll be in jail so why don‚Äôt you just sit down. Wife is now sobbing into the pillow and he sits down. After an uncomfortable silence, he asks, what now. My reply is I have no idea. Wife is still crying a little but sits up. Finally, I pull out my phone and tell them that they are going to tell me everything while I record it all. They look at each and my wife asks what do I mean everything. I say EVERYTHING, how it started, how long this been going on, when, where, hotels, dinners, etc., EVERYTHING. My wife says this is the only time to which I yell BS. There is no way you‚Äôd be comfortable enough to bring him to our bed if this hadn‚Äôt been going on for sometime. If you lie to me again I‚Äôm walking out that door and finding a divorce lawyer. She starts crying again. So for the next 10-15 minutes it all comes out, been going on for over 9 months. Started with him flirting with her etc till he asked her to lunch and she went. A few drinks later they were at a hotel. She came home to me that night like nothing happened. She swears that it was killing her and she wanted to tell me but didn‚Äôt know how. Again I call BS, if it was killing you, it would not have been so easy to keep it going. They even went to a week long convention for work that I used to go with her to. She told me company policy changed and spouses couldn‚Äôt go anymore. I put my phone away and more silence. Than an idea hits me. I look through his clothes for his phone and ask him for passcode. He actually gives it to me so I start going through his phone. I find some pictures of a woman I assume is his wife and ask her name. Carol. She‚Äôs very pretty, but not as pretty as my Ashley I tell him. More picture of kids, find out he has three and finally a family picture of all of them. I hold up the phone and say ‚Äú a beautiful family, why did you throw it all away for a tumble with my wife. His reply ‚Äú what do mean throw it all away‚Äù Me ‚Äú you really think Carol isn‚Äôt going to find out.‚Äù Him ‚Äúhow is she going to find out‚Äù. Me, ‚Äú I‚Äôm going to call her right now‚Äù. He stand up and says ‚Äúno, you can‚Äôt ‚Äú. My wife screams out, ‚Äú please you can‚Äôt do this to him.‚Äù I lost it. ‚ÄúCAN‚ÄôT DO THIS TO HIM‚Äù. ‚Äú You‚Äôve destroyed me, our family, our friends our future and broken my heart and you‚Äôre worried about HIM!!!!! I‚Äôm shaking again, trying not to let her see cry, but i can‚Äôt hold together anymore. I fall back in the chair and start sobbing. She tries to come over to me but I look at her say‚Äù stay the hell away from me.‚Äù After awhile I calm down and look at his phone again. He again says‚Äùplease don‚Äôt I‚Äôm begging you. I swear I‚Äôll tell her.‚Äù Yeah right, I reply. He‚Äôs standing there pleading with me not to as I find her number and decide face time would be even better. She answers and Hi sweeth...looks surprised and says ‚Äúwho are you, is my husband ok?‚Äù He is for now but wont be in a minute. I flip the screen to show him standing there in my wife‚Äôs robe. I say ‚ÄúI believe you know him. The room he‚Äôs standing in is my bedroom, the flowered robe he‚Äôs wearing belongs to this woman‚Äù swingin the phone to catch my wife trying to pull the sheets over her head but to late, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my wife and I came home early today to find them having sex‚Äù. I truly feel sorry for her and lousy for how I did it. She starts crying and he tries the ‚Äúhoney I‚Äôm so sorry, i can explain, it as just one time etc. routine. I tell her not to believe a word that‚Äôs its been going on for over 9 months and that I spent the last 15 minutes recording all the details they were willing to share. I tell her I‚Äôm going to text her my number and she should send me her email and I‚Äôll send her the video. I give him the phone and I hear her tell him when he gets home there will be a bag packed outside and if he tries to come in the house she‚Äôll call the police and hangs up. I toss him his clothes and he leaves after he‚Äôs dressed. Now, its just me and my wife. She looks at me and starts to cry saying she is so sorry, never meant to hurt me, can i forgive her, it didn‚Äôt mean anything. All the usual cheaters BS. I look at her tell her to pack a bag and get the hell out my house. I go downstairs and pour a drink. I‚Äôm sitting on the couch when she comes downstairs. She starts towards me and i say just stop. She asks if we talk about this and I tell her maybe, just maybe, but not now. I tell her its going to be really hard to not look for a divorce lawyer and she starts crying again. She looks at me and I know an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù is coming. I say‚Äù don‚Äôt you dare say that right now cause I don‚Äôt think I will ever believe it anymore. More crying s she turns and walks out the door. Seeing her crying walking out the door, my entire life leaving, I break down and fall on the floor shaking sobbing uncontrollably. No idea how long but I finally sit down, still crying, and call my best friend. I try to speak but start crying again and can‚Äôt get the words out. He asks what‚Äôs wrong but I cant talk. He asks if I‚Äôm at home and i kinda grunt yea and says he‚Äôll be right there. 30 minutes later he‚Äôs in my house, I‚Äôm still crying. I give him my phone with the video up and he proceeds to watch. I can‚Äôt bear to hear it and get us both a drink. He comes in the kitchen and takes me drink away and dumps them both saying‚Äù this isn‚Äôt going to help you‚Äù. Tells me I cant stay here tonight alone and go up stairs and pack a bag. I come downstairs and he has my lab on a leash and we go to his house. That was 10 days ago and I still feel like absolute shit. I know this was long, thanks for reading this far. I will try to update later.

***2021-02-17***

Again, let me say how much I appreciate all the advice and support I‚Äôve received from this community. I owe each and everyone of you a debt of gratitude I will never be able to repay. I can only say thank you and try to reply to all the comments. The support/encouragement has been very helpful. Many of you have said the way I handled the confrontation so well shows strength, but right now I feel anything but. Just really going through the motions. All the advice has been outstanding and is helping me move forward.

Second, the reason for this post and my original was because I was reaching out for help. Believe me there was plenty given. The reason my first post was removed, I was told, was it because to has to much story telling and not asking for support. I will try to keep this short, but I believe details matter. If you didn‚Äôt see the original post, I‚Äôve been told it has made its way to YouTube, use title for search I guess.

So I am beginning to realize that there is no way to come back from this and am 99% sure of what my decision will be, just can‚Äôt get the thought out of my head that I‚Äôll be throwing away 29 years of our lives. Even now I can‚Äôt bring myself to type(stbxw) and still refer as my wife. WTF is wrong with me. Help.

The night of DDay she went to our sons and his wife‚Äôs place. He called wondering what was wrong and why I threw mom out. Told her she needed to tell him or I would. He knows. I went to best friends house. Daughter was supposed to dog sit and comes home to find no dog. Eventually she shows up at BFs place and wants to know what‚Äôs wrong. I tell her. The hurt on her face was worse than seeing wife in bed with boss and killed me. She leaves with dog to house and gets fianc√© to come over.

Saturday morning I tell BF I am going to spend a few days at cabin, can he take me home. He agrees, good idea and I pack up, grab dog and go. Spend time there walking in the woods with dog and splitting firewood. Good workout and therapy. Stay Sat, Sun., drive home Mon. On Monday I started the phone calls. Bank, Credit cards, lawyer I use if I need for company. He recommends someone, I call and see her on Thursday. Play her the recording. She‚Äôs extremely confident and I hire her. Ask about letting wife/boss HR dept. know and she thinks we should hold off. I‚Äôm home sleeping on couch, can‚Äôt bring myself to go in bedroom except for clothes. Friday son calls to tell me mom can‚Äôt stay there anymore, making it hard on him and his wife. Is there anyway wife can come home. I haven‚Äôt spoken to wife since DDay. I give in and say ok. She comes back on Sat. I go back to cabin. Cold as hell, but I manage. Monday I go straight to office, people there love my dog and he gets spoiled. Finally go home Monday night. When I see my wife the only thing I see is what I saw when I opened the bedroom door on DDay. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get past that. Any ideas? Nothing is said. I change and go to my office in basement and try to stay busy. Finally watch tv in basement. She comes downstairs and asks if we can about this. I tell not yet I‚Äôm not ready and please leave me alone while she‚Äôs here. I fall asleep in recliner. Get up early and head to gym. Shower there and go to work. Go home late. That is my routine rest of the week. Friday my HR manager asks how I‚Äôm doing. I told her what had happened earlier and saw therapist she suggested yesterday. She tells me I need to stop sleeping in chairs and on couch. Buy a new bed she tells me. Great Idea. I take $$ out what‚Äôs left in joint acct, wife‚Äôs half and go get new bed. Delivery is Sat. I go to office and wait for call telling me they will be there in 30 min. I stop and pick up a couple of subs for delivery guys and wait down the block. They pull up and I meet them, tell them lunch is on me and give them each $25 to do me a favor. I ask them to not load up old mattress and can they come back later and pick it up. Lean it up against tree near street plz. They look confused and I tell them to give me 5 minutes and come in, they‚Äôll understand. Now I thought of burning old mattress in driveway but didn‚Äôt want to clean that up. I go upstairs and remove bedding. While I‚Äôm doing this something comes back to me that I have to find out about. I take a can of blaze orange spray paint that we use for marking properties we are working on and spray ‚Äú wife cheated on me in our bed‚Äù in big letters. Guys come in and wife asks what‚Äôs going on. I tell her I can‚Äôt sleep in that bed anymore and that she bought me a new one. She acts mad but goes back downstairs. New bed set up, guys leave, old mattress where I asked. Some time passes and she tells me that they left old mattress in yard. They‚Äôre coming back for it I say, trying not to laugh. Still don‚Äôt think she knows, but entire neighborhood does. Valentines Day she tries to be romantic and initiate intimacy. I tell her I wouldn‚Äôt f her now if she was the last woman on earth. She comes back with we don‚Äôt f, we make love in an upset tone. I reply that we haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmade love‚Äù since she started f ing her boss. She looks shocked, did she think I‚Äôd forget? I just am at a loss for understanding. What is going on in her mind? I decide now is as good a time as any to talk and tell her to sit down in living room. I ask her what she wants to do? Are we going to try and fix this or should we divorce and move on? Don‚Äôt know why I even offered this? Guess I‚Äôm stuck on throwing away 29 years. Please talk me out of this. She says she is will ing to do anything I ask to fix this and begs me to forgive her. I tell her she need to come clean to everyone in our family, starting with her parents and my mom(dads been gone for 3 years), including how I found out. Kids don‚Äôt know this detail. They are coming over tonight. Update later how that goes. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at now. Still numb from everything and really fighting urge to go kick her bosses ass. Still need advice. When will this get any better, or is this my new normal?

***Sat Feb 20 2021***

Since posts have been removed, short update as to what has happened since day, then a few more details. Thanks again to everyone for the support. I spent DDay night at friends house. Wife goes to sons and his wife‚Äôs place. Both kids know why mom was kicked out, affair, but no details. Sat. Morning drive to cabin with dog. Stay till Monday. Go to office on Mon. And start phone calls. Bank,C.C. Etc. Call lawyer I use if I need for my company and he recommends divorce attorney. I call her and meet her on Thursday. She says all the right things and I hire her. I talk to my HR manager and tell her everything, close professional friend . She recommends someone for IC and I call and make appt. Have seen her twice and its helping. Friday, week after DDay son calls and says it‚Äôs awkward having mom in their small apt., is there anyway she can come home. I give in. She comes back Sat, but I‚Äôm on my way to cabin. Just to show much I didn‚Äôt want to be around her, it was below zero the whole weekend, with night lows in the -20 to -25 range. Mon. I drive straight to office. People at work love my lab, he gets spoiled. I stay late, go home and can‚Äôt even look at her. Go watch TV in basement, she comes down and asks if we can talk about this. I tell her I‚Äôm not ready and leave me alone while she‚Äôs here. Fri. HR manager asks how I‚Äôm doing. Lousy I tell her, been sleeping on couch or recliner in basement. She suggests I buy a new bed, great idea. I go pick one out delivery‚Äôs is Sat. I thought about burning old one like some have suggested, but don‚Äôt want to clean up mess. Sat I go to work and wait for call that ruck will be there in 30 minutes. I pick up two subs for delivery guys and wait for them. I tell them lunch is on me and give them each $25 if they can do me a favor. Leave old mattress up against tree next to street and come back for it at the end of their day. They look confused, but I tell them to give me 5 min. Before they come and they will get it. I go in, remove bedding, something clicks that I have to ask about. I take a can of blaze orange spray paint that we use for marking properties we are working on and spray in big letters ‚Äú wife cheated in our bed‚Äù on mattress. Guys follow through and leave it against tree. wife says later, they forgot to take old one away, I tell her they are coming back for. I don‚Äôt think she knows what I did. Valentine‚Äôs Day she tries to be all romantic, makes nice dinner which I don‚Äôt eat. Tries to initiate intimacy. I tell her I wouldn‚Äôt f her if she were the last woman on earth, She replies, we don‚Äôt f we make love. I tell her we haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmade love‚Äù since she decide to f her boss. Can‚Äôt really describe the look on her face. She goes to kitchen trying not to cry. I figure now‚Äôs as good a time as any and tell her to come in LR and sit down. I ask her what she wants to do, I know, stupid move, should we just divorce and move on or should we work to fix this. She tells me she‚Äôs willing to do anything to fix this, to make it up to me. Not sure how she can make it up to me but I tell her needs to come clean with rest of family before we can try and fix anything. She agrees. That was the last up date that was removed.

2/17 my mom(dads been gone 3 years) her folks, sister and BIL come over that night. We all sit in LR and I try to get as far away from her as possible. They start in with the, what‚Äôs wrong, we love you, it will all be okay thinking someone is really sick. I look at her and say this story isn‚Äôt going to tell itself. Her dad looks at me and I swear his eyes are saying Oh No like he knows what‚Äôs coming. I have to give her credit, she cries her way through and spilled her guts, including me walking in on them in our bed. After a long uncomfortable silence, she says somebody say something. I say what are they supposed to say, that you are a horrible person, that you hurt me worse than you know, ripped my heart out, that you‚Äôve thrown away 29 years ruined our family, not to mention what you 2 assholes have done to his family. Was the sex really that good, that it was worth all that. I just kept going, all the anger, hatred and betrayal Ive been holding inside comes spilling out. I really didn‚Äôt know I could be so cruel. Her mom finally says that‚Äôs enough. She says that no, she deserves all of it and runs up stairs crying. Mom gets up to go after her and dad says no,leave her alone, she needs to suffer for awhile before this can get any better. We talk for awhile, they offer support and say I need anything just ask. I tell I‚Äôve been in IC and I think I‚Äôll be ok but appreciate it. I tell them that despite all of it, I still love her and that she going to need them more than I do. I go to bed and sleep better than I have since DDay. Next morning before I leave I go in the guest room and can tell she didn‚Äôt sleep and has been crying all night. I really think that for the first time since DDay the enormity of what‚Äôs happening has finally hit her. Telling her family and having me go off on her like I did, I think it broke her out of the ‚Äúaffair fog‚Äù. She looks like she truly showing remorse. I tell her we need to talk, more like I talk, she listens. I explain that i‚Äùm 99% leaning towards divorce, but am still clinging to the life raft that is 1%. That if there is to be any hope she need to do what I ask to help me get over this. She says she‚Äôll do anything, just to please not do anything yet. I remind her of a story I told her when my dad died. When I was 17 my dad told me that you‚Äôll have hard times in life, but how you handle them says more about you than the hard times will ever do. No matter what, never make make important decisions when you are upset. At the time I was like ya dad, whatever. i start to cry as I say I wish he were still here so i could tell him that I really was listening. She gets up and gives me a hug, I don‚Äôt hug her back, but it feels good, which scares me. She sits back down and I tell her she needs to move out. I can‚Äôt heal if I see her everyday. We need to go NC. She agrees and asks me what else she can do.I tell her I‚Äôm to emotional now to think straight, it I‚Äôll let er what else. On my way to work I call my lawyer and see if I can come see her today. She‚Äôs free on her way to the office and we meet for coffee. I tell her what‚Äôs been going on the 99-1% etc. Ask her to draw up divorce papers to get things rolling if I go that way. She suggest that if I have time and can afford it I should find my wife an apartment and pay for the first months rent. That if it goes as far as a judge, this will show good faith on my part for an amicable split. I agree and she says she‚Äôll have something for me to look at by Monday. I get to work and call a real estate broker that we‚Äôve done a lot of work for over the years. Tell him what‚Äôs going on and what I need. He says he knows a good rental agent and he‚Äô have him call me. He calls and says he‚Äôll start looking and get back to me. He calls back with a place that fits in price, location etc. I meet with the property manager and give him a check for the rest of Feb., March and deposit. When I get home I tell my wife I found her a place, what I‚Äôve paid for and she has to go meet manager and sign lease. It‚Äôs only a six month lease which is plus I guess. She says that she is surprised that I moved so quickly andI tell her that I needed her not to come home from our sons. While she is gone I call some movers and luckily its the middle of the month and they can come Saturday. When she gets home I tell her Ive done with movers and ask her why he hasn‚Äôt asked about anything financial. She looks confused and told her I‚Äôve cancelled credit cards, took my half out our joint account and cancelled debit card. She seems angry about says she doesn‚Äôt blame me. Turns out she hasn‚Äôt needed to spend anything, that her time spent between our sons and home she hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere or needed anything. I also find out she called her employer and asked for a leave of absence, that she was having personal issues. They let her take her paid vacation if she wanted before starting leave of absence. Friday I tell her she can take whatever she need for new place, just leave me something and not anything from the basement and a couple of my family heirloom stuff, and my new bed. I also tell her that I‚Äôm willing to try MC. That she should find 3 different ones and I‚Äôll pick the one that I think will be the best. I leave early Sat morning and I come home to a half empty house, including TV. That‚Äôs ok, I want bigger one anyway. My friend still has my liquor so I stopped and picked up my favorite bourbon and have enjoyed sipping on a glass while typing this. Sorry this was so long, Thanks fo reading this far. Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to the gym and am going to make my favorite chili and go buy a new TV. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have more to post in the future.

***Fri Feb 26 2021***

Today is 4 weeks since DDay. Good as day as any for an update. Thanks to everyone for the comments, support, advice and perspective. Sunday night got a call from younger sister. Honestly don‚Äôt know why I hadn‚Äôt told her yet. Our mom called her and told her to call me. She told me to come and visit before I get busy in spring. Her and her husband live in SC. I might do that. Monday morning I met with my lawyer and went over divorce papers. Two big points, she stays out of my company and I keep the house and buy out her half of the equity over a 5 year period. No alimony as she has a good paying job. Land the cabin is on was given to me by grandfather, if she wants any increase in value because of cabin I built there, we will talk about that. This is all contingent on her agreeing to this being uncontested. Just waiting for time to be right. Later at work stbxw called and talked to my assistant, gave her 3 names and numbers. She told her I was in and she could talk to me, she said no just give him the numbers and I‚Äôll know what they are. Three MC therapist, I did know. Assistant comes in to give me the numbers and closes door behind her and asks what‚Äôs going on, why didn‚Äôt she want to talk to me. She has been with me over 20 years and I know the look, not going away till I talk. So, I tell her. She is shocked as everyone else and insists that I have to let rest of my work family, people that are there now working year round and have been there the longest, know what is happening. I agree and have her gather in design room. Tell the story again and they are surprised and offer support. I ask my IT guy to come to my office and ask him if he can track STBXW phone calls and text messages. He explains since it‚Äôs really company phone it wont be a problem. Later he emails me all he has. I save it look at later. Before I leave, I call MCs and ask questions. One is polite but short. Next says I can ask at first session. Not. Third stays on phone with me 30 minutes, answering my questions and asking me a few. My big one, is how she define success, does that mean we reconcile and get back together. She tells we that to her its whatever is best for both of us, could be staying together, could be divorce. I set an appointment for Thursday. Tuesday I have lunch with APs wife. We sit for 2 hours, comparing notes, seeing if either of knows more than they told me on day. Trying to figure why they did this, what did we do wrong, what did we miss. We both agree this is not our fault. In hindsight, she realizes she missed or ignored some red flags and thinks this isn‚Äôt first time. He left previous company rather abruptly and was not working for awhile. I suggest she should ask her lawyer to try and get employment records if possible. Since it might have bearing on any divorce proceedings there might be a way he can subpoena records. She has been letting him live in basement but never sees him. She asks if I would be willing to do her a favor, of course my answer. She wants to meet AP for lunch and wants me to surprise him so we both can grill him. When and where, I‚Äôll be there. Set it up for Wednesday. That night I went to STBXW new apartment unannounced. Wondering if my decision will be made for me if I find AP there. She answers the door and looks like hell. Like she hasn‚Äô slept or eaten since she moved out. Two separate emotions when I see her. The part that is angry say to f ing bad you brought this on yourself. The part that still cares wants to reach out and comfort, protect her. She hugs me and resist urge to hug back. I sit down and ask her for something to drink. Brings me a diet Mt Dew. I ask her to see her phone. No hesitation, she hands it to me. I spend 30 minutes going through it, no conversation. Several texts to AP telling him she never wants to see him again, how could she have been so stupid to get involved with him, to fall for his bs. That she ruined and thrown away the best thing she had in her life. I have what I needed‚Äîgoing to compare to what my IT has and see if anything has been deleted. Give her the phone back. Tell her that while I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt lied to her I haven‚Äôt told her everything. Tell her I have a lawyer and divorce papers are made up. No crying, just a look of defeat. Tell her she should get one. She gets an incoming text. Starts swearing at phone. Shows it me. It‚Äôs AP saying he is so depressed and needs to see her. I tell her I can leave if he wants to come over. She tells me no, and shows me what he texts back. Basically, F off and never contact her again. I ask her why she hasn‚Äôt blocked him. Says, duh, I should know that. I watch as she does. I tell her we have and appt with MC on Thursday. She looks happy but I tell her don‚Äôt get to excited. Nothing is guaranteed. Tell her she need to make list of what she is willing to do to help me heal and fix things, bring it Thursday. I leave. All for now. This is to long already. Have some work to finish. I‚Äôll try to update more tonight.

***Sun Feb 28 2021***

Continuing where I left off, Wednesday morning I lock myself in my office goin over all my IT guy sent me. Matches what I saw on wife‚Äôs phone night before. Go to meet APs wife and surprise AP at their lunch meeting. He freaks out wen he sees me. She tells him to calm down she invited me. He looks shocked. We grill him for half hour. He confirms what I saw on STBXW phone records. First 3 months EA, only became physical last 6 months. I know, BFD, like that changes anything. I ask if he‚Äôs contacted or tried to contact STBXW since DDay. He says no and I call BS. Tell them I was with her when you texted her last night about how depressed you are and really want to see her. AP‚Äôs wife has smoke coming out of her ears but stays calm. I then ask him what happened at your old employer, why did you leave so suddenly. He says no of my business. I tell you might as well fess up because its going to come out anyway. Don‚Äôt you owe your wife some honesty for once. he still refuses. I bluff and tell him my lawyer is going subpoena the records since it will show a pattern of behavior related to my STBXW in our divorce. He looks scared and confused. After awhile he admits to having an affair with a co worker that got him fired. She goes nuts. Calls him very name in the book. He can get the f out of the house. She calms down before we get kicked out. Starts crying and tells him he needs to leave and pack his things and get out of the house. He refuses, bu I convince him to leave and give her some space. She and I talk for awhile and she asks if she can have my lawyers number. Turns out she was going to try and work it out with him until 5 minutes ago. Now she wants to rake him over the coals. We leave and I tell her to call me if she needs anything. Realizing that his life is about to be as messed up as mine puts a brief smile on my face.

Thursday, STBXW meets me at MC. Sitting in her office and therapist starts by telling us some ground rules about how hard this is going to be, that it really be up to us if this is going to work out. She says we need to be brutally honest with each other and ourselves and she is there to help in anyway possible. She asks who wants to start and I speak up. I tel them both that I will work as hard as I can but it will be tough. Three things I can‚Äôt seem to get over. First every time I see her I don‚Äôt see the woman I married but all I see is the vision of her boss on top of her, f ing her. Second, when I was about to call his wife her response wasn‚Äôt concern for me but rather ‚Äúyou cant do this to him‚Äù. Finally, I don‚Äôt believe she is really remorseful for all the hurt she has caused not only me but our family, friends and APs family, she‚Äôs only sorry she got caught. If I hadn‚Äôt walked in that day, she would still be f ing him. It feels good to get that off my chest. She is crying but I really don‚Äôt care. Truthfully, I believe she is finally starting to realize all she has done and is starting to show remorse it might be to late. She starts to talk about how she knows she ruined everything, that it is nobody‚Äôs fault but her own. How she know she has to accept the burden of the consequences of what she has done, that her main concern is to help me got over what she has done, but realizes that it might never be enough and I will probably leave anyway. Goes on to say how I shouldn‚Äôt in anyway blame myself, that I have been a great husband, father, partner, lover and best friend. She says that she really can‚Äôt give me a good answer if I were to ask why, because can‚Äôt answer that for herself, she started IC yesterday and hopefully she might be able to tell herself why someday and maybe give me an answer. She reaches in her purse and hands her list to me. I tell her to give it to therapist. She looks at it and asks if I want to go over it. I tell her I‚Äôll look at it on my own and we can discuss it next time. We talk for awhile and time is up. We agree to meet next week. Before we leave they both ask me not to do anything yet, that this was a good first step. Today is Saturday and still haven‚Äôt looked at the list.

Not much else is going on. Kids are coming over for dinner tomorrow. I going to give them more details about what happened, what‚Äôs going on now and ask how they feel about getting a paternity test. Will update later.

***Mon Mar 01 2021***

Just a quick update. Dinner with kids moved to tomorrow. Thought I would call STBXW and tell her I needed to talk to her. I had gone and bought a different phone this afternoon at the suggestion of people here to try something sneaky on her.

She showed up with carryout from my favorite Chinese place. Told her to come in but that I wasn‚Äôt going sit and have dinner with her. Before she came over I typed a text to her pretending to be AP telling her wife threw me out. I‚Äôm really depressed and need to see you. Please don‚Äôt hate me. We were good together and can still be, just give me a chance to prove that to you. You know I really care for you and believe you feel the same way. Please, I need to see you.

Just waiting for right time to send it.

We sit at kitchen table.and I start. Tell her about meeting with OBS and the meeting the next day with AP and OBS. About him lying about contacting her, but I hold off on the part about why he lost his last job Tell her about OBS being pissed off and throwing him out.

A grill has maybe 1/4 of the surface area via a grate, the rest is just air.

From a scientific basis it makes sense.  Metal is the most heat conductive material that u can use to sear. It‚Äôs the same reason when you touch room temp metal it feels cold, because it removes heat from your hand quickly, the inverse happens when the metal is hot.

Picture this: I'm struggling with FOUR massive suitcases plus carry-on, literally about to have an airport meltdown as everything starts falling off my trolley...

And then he appeared. Like some guardian angel in locs and a nose ring (which btw, looked amazing on him üëÄ). Without hesitation, without me even having to ask, this absolute gentleman just walked over and offered to help. Y'all, I literally froze. In that moment, my brain was doing mental gymnastics between ""omg a genuinely kind stranger"" and ""holy shit he's gorgeous"" üò≥

He just... fixed everything. Lifted those heavy bags like they were nothing, arranged them perfectly on the trolley. And before I could properly thank him or maybe shoot my shot, his friend showed up and \*poof\* - he was gone.

Here's the thing that got me though: I've been going through it lately. Work has been BRUTAL these past couple months - the kind of stress and exhaustion that sits heavy on your shoulders but nobody can see. You know that feeling? When you're drowning but have to keep smiling? Yeah, that.

And then this random act of kindness just... hit different. It wasn't just about the bags. It was about someone seeing another human struggling and just... helping. No ulterior motives. No expectations. Just pure kindness when I needed it most.

So, hot stranger with the locs, if you're somehow reading this - thank you. You have no idea how much that simple gesture meant. Coffee's on me if you're up for it, but if our paths never cross again, just know you made someone's day in ways you couldn't imagine.

TL;DR: Gorgeous stranger helped me with my luggage at JKIA when I was having a rough day, disappeared before I could properly thank him, and now I can't stop thinking about this random act of kindness.",7,1735154745.0,nairobi,0,1.0,False

1. What are the best neighborhoods to live in as a young person looking to make friends? (can afford ~¬£2,600/month; <35min commute to Kensington for work)

2. Is it worth signing a short-term rental (Airbnb, Blueground, etc.) prior to a 12-month lease ‚Äî or can I generally feel comfortable pulling the trigger without visiting a flat in person?

3. Would you recommend I find a flatmate for social reasons or live alone; independently, what are some great ways to meet other new grads / folks in their early-20s?

I‚Äôve never been superstitious, and I, technically speaking, still had no reason to be. If you‚Äôve read my last post, you could be thinking the same thing. There‚Äôs nothing in there that I‚Äôve described that could not have some sort of rational, mundane explanation. The odd handprints could possibly be from some harmless prankster. The cats could‚Äôve gotten spooked because cats just get spooked by nothing sometimes. The gust of wind I felt could‚Äôve just been a gust of wind on an otherwise calm night. Even the voices could‚Äôve come from some asshole that missed their calling as a voice actor or ventriloquist. The could‚Äôve heard my wife and I talk before and just figured out how to mimic us. I really wish I could believe all that. I really do. But RocksAnn and I have an awful gut feeling that most, if not all, of the recent shenanigans and goings on are part of one real life paranormal horror show. And the show must go on.

After that night, we stopped seeing the handprints on our vehicles and windows. We started seeing them around the house instead. On countertops, the walls, the tv, the couch, the fridge even. We also started finding bare footprints. Our guest was feeling free to make themselves at home, it seems. And our cats; they all started behaving differently. Rorschach, our kitten, became increasingly skittish. Normally, he hated being in his cage, which was where we fed him. He was always crying and nagging to get out as soon as he finished eating. Now he was reluctant to come out, and when he did he preferred to stay under the couch. H√§agen-Dazs behaved similarly, but with more aggression. Often she would stare and hiss and something that wasn‚Äôt there, or at least nothing I could see, she would calm down after that but still stare in the same direction. Tarrare, though, seemed relatively undisturbed, her only thing being that she seemed to run around more, and was just a little more frantic. She was always the more, well, simple of our cats, happy as long as she got her meals on time.

My wife and I were both in sorry states. For one thing, our house was freezing now. No matter how high we put the heater, we felt like we were in Alaska, despite living near the border of Mexico. There was a heaviness to the house now. It felt like our souls stayed at the door and we were husks inside our home. We spent a lot of our time outside, going for long walks, sometimes til our feet burned. We didn‚Äôt like being in the house. We didn‚Äôt like our cats being there either, so until we could figure out our situation, we took the cats to my in-laws. It was a chore explaining why we needed them to pet sit when we weren‚Äôt going anywhere. After hearing about the handprints and the cold and all the rest, they thought our house was demon infested. Wasn‚Äôt surprised to hear it from them. They were very religious to the point they were at times reluctant to purchase secondhand items out of paranoia about whether or not they would unwittingly buy something demon-possessed.

‚ÄúBy now the whole house must be infested,‚Äù said Rosa, RocksAnns mother. ‚ÄúOnly thing you can really do now is move out and let it have your house. You don‚Äôt want it to have your souls.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt that simple,‚Äù RocksAnn said. ‚ÄúWe moved here because we can‚Äôt afford to go anywhere else right now. It could be years before we‚Äôre able to make any kind of move.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù I put in. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know for sure what exactly it even is. How do you know it‚Äôs a demon and not something else? Maybe it‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever you think it might or might not be,‚Äù Rosa rebuffed, ‚ÄúDo you really think it has good intentions towards y‚Äôall?‚Äù

It was hard to argue with that. It felt like we were being toyed with in our own house. That feeling wasn‚Äôt made any better the next morning when I walked into the kitchen. As I grabbed a mug to make coffee, I found something new on the counter. Dirt, but not a handprint. It was an arrow. It pointed to the kitchen window, and toward the cemetery. I heard a shatter. When I looked at the floor, I only then realized that, in my shock, I had let my mug slip from my hand. If that arrow didn‚Äôt signify malevolent intent, I don‚Äôt know what did. Either our stranger wanted to kill us, or he wanted us to finish the job ourselves. I showed my wife what I saw, and we could only sit in stunned silence. My wife was in a numb state. She was staring blankly out the window. I was the opposite. Anxious and fidgety, I almost jumped out of my skin every time I heard the smallest sound. I would‚Äôve been shivering even if I wasn‚Äôt freezing cold. Finally RocksAnn spoke.

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do about this?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt the first time either of us asked that question, but we needed a final answer, an answer I didn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Even if we try to move, we‚Äôre gonna have to be in and out of the house for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll the more reason to start moving now,‚Äù she urged. ‚ÄúHow long can we stay before we‚Äôre driven insane?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I sipped my coffee. Everything tasted more and more the same each day. Murky. ‚ÄúI wish we didn‚Äôt have to spend one more day here. Or night.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than being here forever,‚Äù she was still staring out the window. Finally she looked at me. ‚ÄúMy parents are offering to let us stay in their trailer until we can find a new place. It won‚Äôt be ready until tomorrow, so we‚Äôll have to make do with one more night here, unless we can afford a motel.‚Äù

We could barely afford two days of groceries right now much less a motel. ‚ÄúOne more night it is,‚Äù I replied.

We tried to spend most of our time out of the house. We walked at the park, went by the thrift store, went by the post office, anything to keep us out of the house. Eventually though, we had to go back home. We actually fell asleep a little more easily that night. Maybe knowing that we would soon leave this nightmare behind set our tired minds at ease.

Sometime in the middle of the night, my slumber was rudely interrupted. I awoke in a sneezing fit. It wasn‚Äôt really surprising, I had allergies off and on. I went to the kitchen for tissues. When I touched my face though, my shivers from the past days melted away in a white hot rage, though I was still scared to the bone. I felt dirt on my face. I‚Äôd had enough.

‚ÄúGet out of our damn house!‚Äù I shrieked at the top of my lungs. I heard my wife run to the bedroom door before I finished my sentence. ‚ÄúGet out! Get out now! Leave us the fuck alone! I swear I‚Äôll burn this house down with you in it!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?!‚Äù, my wife asked.

I grabbed her hand and placed it on my face.

‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù was all she could say.

‚ÄúThis thing stole our home. It‚Äôs stealing our life away.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt let it take anymore,‚Äù she assured me as she held me close. After I calmed down I noticed something.

‚ÄúRocksAnn, do you feel something?‚Äù I asked.

She looked at me with a nervous look on her face. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. The cold is gone.‚Äù Her eyes lit up once she realized.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think-‚Äú she began.

‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre safe now?‚Äù, I finished. ‚ÄúToo early to tell. I guess we‚Äôll see over the next few days maybe.‚Äù

We spent the next several days in the house. Miraculously, everything seemed back to normal. The chill was gone. We didn‚Äôt find any handprints or footprints or anything inside or outside. Most importantly, we felt alive again. Actually alive in our own home. We couldn‚Äôt figure out why though. Why was one show of outrage enough to banish the stranger? As it turns out I‚Äôd get more answers than I hoped for.

One afternoon, while I was washing dishes, I found myself gazing out the window and towards the cemetery. It still looked quiet and peaceful despite everything. My musings were interrupted by a familiar sounds. The same pawing I heard the night I let the stranger into our house. It was slower this time. My heart dropped at the noise. I couldn‚Äôt stomach the thought of going through all this again. No way I was going to let it in again. I heard something else though. My wife‚Äôs voice, not talking, but sobbing. Then they sobbed in my voice, then in both of ours. Another cruel joke to toy with us. RocksAnn, who‚Äôd been in the living room, was by my side now. We listened to the pawing and the crying. What if it didn‚Äôt stop? Or what if it came back again and again? While it cried, it spoke in our voices.

‚ÄúI-I-I‚Äôm‚Ä¶s-s-sor-sor-ry,‚Äù it groaned. ‚ÄúD-Did not-t wan-nt‚Ä¶hurt-t. On-nly w-want h-hel-p. Pl-ease. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶c-cold.‚Äù

RocksAnn and I looked at each other. We were taken aback by how they spoke, not that they used our voices, but how they used them. They sounded absolutely pained. And that last thing they said. Were they really living such a miserable existence?

‚ÄúP-please!‚Äù, they started again, ‚ÄúF-find g-grave. Dig.‚Äù The sobbing faded, and so did the cold chill by the door. My wife and I talked throughout the rest of the day about our experience. We went back and forth over whether this was some kind of trick, or our stranger really did need help. Even if they were sincere, what could we do? Obviously they wanted us to find and dig up a grave, what for, we couldn‚Äôt say. We eventually decided it couldn‚Äôt hurt to drop by the cemetery. So that‚Äôs what we did the following morning. We took a walk through the cemetery, not knowing what we were looking for. We combed over every tomstone, hoping our stranger might‚Äôve left some kind of sign. Our search paid off after maybe an hour or so of looking. One tombstone I can‚Äôt remember who it belonged to, it had a dirt arrow on it, pointing to its right. We followed the aisle of stones further, until we came to a small plot with a dirt handprint on its stone. It had one name on it: Stan. There was no year of birth, nor any statement about the person or his life. Their year of death was 1893. RocksAnn and I felt the chill return for a brief, silent moment, then it was gone again.

After another lengthy discussion that afternoon, my wife and I came to a decision. We were going to help this stranger, Stan. We didn‚Äôt like the thought of defiling a grave. But if we didn‚Äôt, Stan might never be done with us, and whoever he was, we didn‚Äôt want anyone to be doomed to an eternal lonely cold. That night, we took a shovel and found Jeremiah‚Äôs grave. RocksAnn held the flashlight while I started digging. It was a cold night, but not freezing. I guess Stan decided it best not to disturb us. It didn‚Äôt take long until I hit an old and worn wooden coffin. After clearing away the dirt I pried it open with the shovel. What we saw inside will haunt us more than anything else that happened prior. The body was so small. It couldn‚Äôt have been more than ten years old at the time of death. This stranger, this kid, had been wandering cold and alone for well over a century. Had he ever tried to ask anyone else for help? If he did, it hadn‚Äôt worked until now.

What did he need now? We dug up his grave. Was there more we had to do? We decided to look in his tattered pockets for anything to clue us in. To my surprise, I did find something. RocksAnn shined a light on the small stub of paper I‚Äôd pulled out. It was a train ticket. This poor kid must‚Äôve been wanting to go home, and never made it back in life. We weren‚Äôt sure if this was what he wanted now, but we couldn‚Äôt figure what else it could be. So we covered his grave, and booked it to the old dilapidated train station. It was currently being reconstructed, and passenger trains never stopped here. We didn‚Äôt know what we expected to happen, but we stepped onto the platform with the ticket and waited. Before ten minutes had passed, a mist set in and covered the ground. It rose to our knees, and in the dark, the platform and track were completely invisible to our eyes. Then we heard the blaring of a train horn. No, not a horn. It was the howl of a steam whistle, coming from our left. The sound of it rumbling along the tracks filled the air and grew louder with each passing second. That was when he finally approached. Stan‚Äôs cold chill filled the air once more, but it was different now. The cold wasn‚Äôt so oppressive now. It felt lighter, more endurable. I hoped it was for Stan too.

We never saw the train. We didn‚Äôt see it stop at the platform, though we heard it slow until its wheels screeched to a halt. We didn‚Äôt see Stan step aboard a passenger car, though the chill of his presence vanished, and the ticket in my hand whisked away in a sharp breeze. We didn‚Äôt see the old locomotive begin its departure, though we heard the cry of its whistle which then echoed through the cold desert night, and felt the smoke from the engines smokestack in our lungs. We didn‚Äôt see the train vanish into the night, though the galloping of the engine and its cars slowly fades into the distance. We saw nothing on that platform but a mist that came and went. We saw nothing, but RocksAnn and I both knew it was over. I hoped our stranger made it home safely.",0,1735154648.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

1hm73ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmetophobiaTalk/comments/1hm73ti/update_on_my_dad/,Update on my dad.,"Hey all, so yesterday around 4am, I found my dad pacing around the basement saying he had sudden, unexplained diarrhea, and some nausea.

He had 4 or 5 bouts of liquid diarrhea, that he also says turned clear towards the end there, and was having waves of nausea.

He said only at one point did he think he was going to throw up, but he thinks it was just from being nervous, and said as soon as he sniffed some alcohol, it stopped.

For the rest of the day, he was having on and off cramps, had a bad headache, mild body aches, skin sensitivity, and felt hot and cold in waves.

Now our basement is freezing, so that could be why he felt cold, but he usually feels hot all the time, so I don't really know.

He also mentioned that when he laid down, it made his stomach feel off again.

I woke up today, and he said around 3am he started feeling basically normal again, and even got up and ate a frozen dinner this morning, and had a coffee.

He said his kidneys hurt today, and he is still getting some minor cramps, but that's it.

The only two things I can think of, is a mild stomach virus, or mild food poisoning.

The night before, he ate expired cheese, and expired potato chips, so it could have been that. However, he also went to the mall on Sunday, so he could have caught something there too.

When I had a stomach virus in 2019, my symptoms tracked with his, except I threw up twice then.

It started out of nowhere around 3am, threw up once at 6am, then again at 12pm, it didn't happen again after that, and the diarrhea stopped, but for the rest of the day, it felt like a really bad flu. When I got up the next day, I felt like 80% better, but my back hurt really bad, and I was really weak.

I know that was my experience, but considering my dad is having like the same thing going on, minus puking, I think he had a mild stomach virus.

So I guess I'll be avoiding the basement bathroom for the next month as a precaution since the virus can still be shed for 2 weeks, then can further live another 2 weeks on surfaces.

I feel like everything is turned upside down now.

Also, last night around 1am, I started not feeling well myself. I have a heavy feeling in my stomach, and feel mildly nauseous. I fell asleep around 4am, but when I got up this afternoon, I didn't feel any better.

I'm hoping it's from not eating, and stress, but I don't know.

Also, my mom was downstairs with him, sitting on the couch where he spent the whole day yesterday, so if he was sick, she's definitely going to get it.

I‚Äôve never been superstitious, and I, technically speaking, still had no reason to be. If you‚Äôve read my last post, you could be thinking the same thing. There‚Äôs nothing in there that I‚Äôve described that could not have some sort of rational, mundane explanation. The odd handprints could possibly be from some harmless prankster. The cats could‚Äôve gotten spooked because cats just get spooked by nothing sometimes. The gust of wind I felt could‚Äôve just been a gust of wind on an otherwise calm night. Even the voices could‚Äôve come from some asshole that missed their calling as a voice actor or ventriloquist. The could‚Äôve heard my wife and I talk before and just figured out how to mimic us. I really wish I could believe all that. I really do. But RocksAnn and I have an awful gut feeling that most, if not all, of the recent shenanigans and goings on are part of one real life paranormal horror show. And the show must go on.

After that night, we stopped seeing the handprints on our vehicles and windows. We started seeing them around the house instead. On countertops, the walls, the tv, the couch, the fridge even. We also started finding bare footprints. Our guest was feeling free to make themselves at home, it seems. And our cats; they all started behaving differently. Rorschach, our kitten, became increasingly skittish. Normally, he hated being in his cage, which was where we fed him. He was always crying and nagging to get out as soon as he finished eating. Now he was reluctant to come out, and when he did he preferred to stay under the couch. H√§agen-Dazs behaved similarly, but with more aggression. Often she would stare and hiss and something that wasn‚Äôt there, or at least nothing I could see, she would calm down after that but still stare in the same direction. Tarrare, though, seemed relatively undisturbed, her only thing being that she seemed to run around more, and was just a little more frantic. She was always the more, well, simple of our cats, happy as long as she got her meals on time.

My wife and I were both in sorry states. For one thing, our house was freezing now. No matter how high we put the heater, we felt like we were in Alaska, despite living near the border of Mexico. There was a heaviness to the house now. It felt like our souls stayed at the door and we were husks inside our home. We spent a lot of our time outside, going for long walks, sometimes til our feet burned. We didn‚Äôt like being in the house. We didn‚Äôt like our cats being there either, so until we could figure out our situation, we took the cats to my in-laws. It was a chore explaining why we needed them to pet sit when we weren‚Äôt going anywhere. After hearing about the handprints and the cold and all the rest, they thought our house was demon infested. Wasn‚Äôt surprised to hear it from them. They were very religious to the point they were at times reluctant to purchase secondhand items out of paranoia about whether or not they would unwittingly buy something demon-possessed.

‚ÄúBy now the whole house must be infested,‚Äù said Rosa, RocksAnns mother. ‚ÄúOnly thing you can really do now is move out and let it have your house. You don‚Äôt want it to have your souls.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt that simple,‚Äù RocksAnn said. ‚ÄúWe moved here because we can‚Äôt afford to go anywhere else right now. It could be years before we‚Äôre able to make any kind of move.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù I put in. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know for sure what exactly it even is. How do you know it‚Äôs a demon and not something else? Maybe it‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever you think it might or might not be,‚Äù Rosa rebuffed, ‚ÄúDo you really think it has good intentions towards y‚Äôall?‚Äù

It was hard to argue with that. It felt like we were being toyed with in our own house. That feeling wasn‚Äôt made any better the next morning when I walked into the kitchen. As I grabbed a mug to make coffee, I found something new on the counter. Dirt, but not a handprint. It was an arrow. It pointed to the kitchen window, and toward the cemetery. I heard a shatter. When I looked at the floor, I only then realized that, in my shock, I had let my mug slip from my hand. If that arrow didn‚Äôt signify malevolent intent, I don‚Äôt know what did. Either our stranger wanted to kill us, or he wanted us to finish the job ourselves. I showed my wife what I saw, and we could only sit in stunned silence. My wife was in a numb state. She was staring blankly out the window. I was the opposite. Anxious and fidgety, I almost jumped out of my skin every time I heard the smallest sound. I would‚Äôve been shivering even if I wasn‚Äôt freezing cold. Finally RocksAnn spoke.

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do about this?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt the first time either of us asked that question, but we needed a final answer, an answer I didn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Even if we try to move, we‚Äôre gonna have to be in and out of the house for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll the more reason to start moving now,‚Äù she urged. ‚ÄúHow long can we stay before we‚Äôre driven insane?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I sipped my coffee. Everything tasted more and more the same each day. Murky. ‚ÄúI wish we didn‚Äôt have to spend one more day here. Or night.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than being here forever,‚Äù she was still staring out the window. Finally she looked at me. ‚ÄúMy parents are offering to let us stay in their trailer until we can find a new place. It won‚Äôt be ready until tomorrow, so we‚Äôll have to make do with one more night here, unless we can afford a motel.‚Äù

We could barely afford two days of groceries right now much less a motel. ‚ÄúOne more night it is,‚Äù I replied.

We tried to spend most of our time out of the house. We walked at the park, went by the thrift store, went by the post office, anything to keep us out of the house. Eventually though, we had to go back home. We actually fell asleep a little more easily that night. Maybe knowing that we would soon leave this nightmare behind set our tired minds at ease.

Sometime in the middle of the night, my slumber was rudely interrupted. I awoke in a sneezing fit. It wasn‚Äôt really surprising, I had allergies off and on. I went to the kitchen for tissues. When I touched my face though, my shivers from the past days melted away in a white hot rage, though I was still scared to the bone. I felt dirt on my face. I‚Äôd had enough.

‚ÄúGet out of our damn house!‚Äù I shrieked at the top of my lungs. I heard my wife run to the bedroom door before I finished my sentence. ‚ÄúGet out! Get out now! Leave us the fuck alone! I swear I‚Äôll burn this house down with you in it!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?!‚Äù, my wife asked.

I grabbed her hand and placed it on my face.

‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù was all she could say.

‚ÄúThis thing stole our home. It‚Äôs stealing our life away.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt let it take anymore,‚Äù she assured me as she held me close. After I calmed down I noticed something.

‚ÄúRocksAnn, do you feel something?‚Äù I asked.

She looked at me with a nervous look on her face. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. The cold is gone.‚Äù Her eyes lit up once she realized.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think-‚Äú she began.

‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre safe now?‚Äù, I finished. ‚ÄúToo early to tell. I guess we‚Äôll see over the next few days maybe.‚Äù

We spent the next several days in the house. Miraculously, everything seemed back to normal. The chill was gone. We didn‚Äôt find any handprints or footprints or anything inside or outside. Most importantly, we felt alive again. Actually alive in our own home. We couldn‚Äôt figure out why though. Why was one show of outrage enough to banish the stranger? As it turns out I‚Äôd get more answers than I hoped for.

One afternoon, while I was washing dishes, I found myself gazing out the window and towards the cemetery. It still looked quiet and peaceful despite everything. My musings were interrupted by a familiar sounds. The same pawing I heard the night I let the stranger into our house. It was slower this time. My heart dropped at the noise. I couldn‚Äôt stomach the thought of going through all this again. No way I was going to let it in again. I heard something else though. My wife‚Äôs voice, not talking, but sobbing. Then they sobbed in my voice, then in both of ours. Another cruel joke to toy with us. RocksAnn, who‚Äôd been in the living room, was by my side now. We listened to the pawing and the crying. What if it didn‚Äôt stop? Or what if it came back again and again? While it cried, it spoke in our voices.

‚ÄúI-I-I‚Äôm‚Ä¶s-s-sor-sor-ry,‚Äù it groaned. ‚ÄúD-Did not-t wan-nt‚Ä¶hurt-t. On-nly w-want h-hel-p. Pl-ease. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶c-cold.‚Äù

RocksAnn and I looked at each other. We were taken aback by how they spoke, not that they used our voices, but how they used them. They sounded absolutely pained. And that last thing they said. Were they really living such a miserable existence?

‚ÄúP-please!‚Äù, they started again, ‚ÄúF-find g-grave. Dig.‚Äù The sobbing faded, and so did the cold chill by the door. My wife and I talked throughout the rest of the day about our experience. We went back and forth over whether this was some kind of trick, or our stranger really did need help. Even if they were sincere, what could we do? Obviously they wanted us to find and dig up a grave, what for, we couldn‚Äôt say. We eventually decided it couldn‚Äôt hurt to drop by the cemetery. So that‚Äôs what we did the following morning. We took a walk through the cemetery, not knowing what we were looking for. We combed over every tomstone, hoping our stranger might‚Äôve left some kind of sign. Our search paid off after maybe an hour or so of looking. One tombstone I can‚Äôt remember who it belonged to, it had a dirt arrow on it, pointing to its right. We followed the aisle of stones further, until we came to a small plot with a dirt handprint on its stone. It had one name on it: Stan. There was no year of birth, nor any statement about the person or his life. Their year of death was 1893. RocksAnn and I felt the chill return for a brief, silent moment, then it was gone again.

After another lengthy discussion that afternoon, my wife and I came to a decision. We were going to help this stranger, Stan. We didn‚Äôt like the thought of defiling a grave. But if we didn‚Äôt, Stan might never be done with us, and whoever he was, we didn‚Äôt want anyone to be doomed to an eternal lonely cold. That night, we took a shovel and found Jeremiah‚Äôs grave. RocksAnn held the flashlight while I started digging. It was a cold night, but not freezing. I guess Stan decided it best not to disturb us. It didn‚Äôt take long until I hit an old and worn wooden coffin. After clearing away the dirt I pried it open with the shovel. What we saw inside will haunt us more than anything else that happened prior. The body was so small. It couldn‚Äôt have been more than ten years old at the time of death. This stranger, this kid, had been wandering cold and alone for well over a century. Had he ever tried to ask anyone else for help? If he did, it hadn‚Äôt worked until now.

What did he need now? We dug up his grave. Was there more we had to do? We decided to look in his tattered pockets for anything to clue us in. To my surprise, I did find something. RocksAnn shined a light on the small stub of paper I‚Äôd pulled out. It was a train ticket. This poor kid must‚Äôve been wanting to go home, and never made it back in life. We weren‚Äôt sure if this was what he wanted now, but we couldn‚Äôt figure what else it could be. So we covered his grave, and booked it to the old dilapidated train station. It was currently being reconstructed, and passenger trains never stopped here. We didn‚Äôt know what we expected to happen, but we stepped onto the platform with the ticket and waited. Before ten minutes had passed, a mist set in and covered the ground. It rose to our knees, and in the dark, the platform and track were completely invisible to our eyes. Then we heard the blaring of a train horn. No, not a horn. It was the howl of a steam whistle, coming from our left. The sound of it rumbling along the tracks filled the air and grew louder with each passing second. That was when he finally approached. Stan‚Äôs cold chill filled the air once more, but it was different now. The cold wasn‚Äôt so oppressive now. It felt lighter, more endurable. I hoped it was for Stan too.

We never saw the train. We didn‚Äôt see it stop at the platform, though we heard it slow until its wheels screeched to a halt. We didn‚Äôt see Stan step aboard a passenger car, though the chill of his presence vanished, and the ticket in my hand whisked away in a sharp breeze. We didn‚Äôt see the old locomotive begin its departure, though we heard the cry of its whistle which then echoed through the cold desert night, and felt the smoke from the engines smokestack in our lungs. We didn‚Äôt see the train vanish into the night, though the galloping of the engine and its cars slowly fades into the distance. We saw nothing on that platform but a mist that came and went. We saw nothing, but RocksAnn and I both knew it was over. I hoped our stranger made it home safely.",1,1735154607.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1hm72tp,https://i.redd.it/1wrfkifap19e1.jpeg,Y'all have been sleeping on this brand,"I have never been someone into perfumes until this year. This year, I definitely got into them a lot more, but, oh my god, this brand completely changed everything.

I live in Chile, and I had never smelled any niche perfumes before since they are extremely hard to get. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon a place that carried a lot of them. For starters, I'm a gourmand lover‚ÄîI dislike notes that don't resemble things I would eat. So, I was looking for something like that. I tried so many perfumes, but I feel like most brands don't do it for me; they all still smell like perfume.

Then, they let me try *Pi√±a Colada*, and, as the name suggests, it was exactly that. This perfume is a hit of fresh pineapple with a hint of wine and just the tiniest bit of coconut. It's very simple but so true to its name. At first, it smells like you just opened a jar of fresh pineapple‚Äîsweet but not artificially sweet. It‚Äôs more like someone picked the best pineapple in the world, perfectly ripe and juicy. Sometimes, I detect a little acidity, but it‚Äôs more like the faint acidity of white wine. As for the coconut, I can't smell it much‚Äîit‚Äôs there, but the pineapple is so dominant that it gets lost. I‚Äôm a little sad about that, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs amazing.

It lasts about 4‚Äì6 hours on my skin, and after that, it‚Äôs almost gone. However, I can still smell it faintly on my T-shirts even a day later. The projection isn‚Äôt super strong after the first 15 minutes, but I‚Äôve been complimented on it in smaller spaces. I love wearing this in summer.

They also showed me another fragrance (which I haven‚Äôt bought yet) called *Cappuccino Gourmand.* And, oh lord, if you love coffee gourmand scents, this one is for you. When you first spray it, it smells like caramel and coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs like being in a bakery while sipping coffee, in the best way possible. As it settles on the skin, the caramel tones down a bit, and you‚Äôre left with a coffee note blended with something warm and slightly boozy. I‚Äôve seen the official notes, but to me, it smells like a cup of cappuccino with a splash of brandy and just a hint of woodiness.

It has great projection, so I wouldn‚Äôt use more than four sprays. I‚Äôd say it lasts at least 12 hours and even longer on clothes. A word of warning: if you don‚Äôt like sweet fragrances, this isn‚Äôt for you. Also, if you‚Äôre looking for a perfume where coffee is the dominant note, this might not be what you expect. This fragrance is all about the blend‚Äîeverything comes together perfectly, just like a well-made cappuccino.

I have yet to try more fragrances from this brand. They have one called Moka that I really wanted to try, but when I returned, all the testers were gone. Still, if you‚Äôre into trying new niche fragrances, I can‚Äôt recommend this brand enough.

Started a few months ago, with me selling drugs to a cop outside of a jam band concert. Yes, totally my fault. 

Today, Its 57 days of sobriety and a $5500 lawyer fee later, and the legal situation is looking promising, but my financial situation is dire.

One month behind on rent, two months behind on car payment.

So I decided it's time to get a roommate to reduce my living costs. She moved in Sunday, and we introduced our dogs. All was fine for a while until they met face to face in between the couch and coffee table and they get in a little scrap. Not the biggest deal, little cut on my dogs ear. I clean and just by chance I have a vet appointment scheduled tomorrow, so I figured they can double check it then.

Today my dog is panting out of nowhere and I go to see what's up and the ear is super swollen, blood and pus pour out, and now we're sitting at the emergency vet trying to figure out how to pay the bill.

On top of that, I picked up a bunch of shifts this week at my new job. Serving at the restaurant at a ski resort. Should be a really good money making week right? Nope. Water main bursts in the basement of the lodge. While mountains water is shut off and the restaurants are closed until further notices.

At least I'm sober today. My higher power is definitely testing me. I still have faith, but FML.",3,1735154443.0,FML,0,1.0,False

1hm6ywh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hm6ywh/aio_wife_invites_grandmother_against_will_allows/,"AIO - Wife invites grandmother against will, allows family to come over earlier than agreed upon, has left me alone for Christmas Day","Christmas morning began with an uneasy stillness that settled heavily over the house. The husband sat at the kitchen table, staring into his cup of coffee, its steam long gone cold. Across the room, the wife moved with an air of lightness, her cheer oblivious to the tension he had been carrying for days. She was humming softly, arranging decorations, and tidying up as though everything was fine.

But everything wasn‚Äôt fine.

A week ago, the husband had reluctantly agreed to host the wife‚Äôs mother for Christmas. It wasn‚Äôt ideal, but it was manageable. He‚Äôd made his boundaries clear: her mother, and her mother only, could come. Then came the shift‚Äîher grandmother, a woman the husband found utterly incompatible with his values, had invited herself along, and the wife hadn‚Äôt stopped it.

For days, he‚Äôd voiced his discomfort, his frustration. He‚Äôd laid out his terms: no politics, no religion, no praying, no alone time with her grandmother, and a strict four-hour time limit. The wife had nodded along, offering soft reassurances‚Äî‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be okay‚Äù‚Äîbut none of it felt real.

And now, on Christmas morning, the phone call came. The wife hung up and turned to him, her expression hesitant but cheerful. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming a little early,‚Äù she said, almost casually.

The husband stared at her, his pulse quickening. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked sharply, his voice low.

‚ÄúThey just wanted to come by a bit sooner,‚Äù she said with a small shrug, as if this was no big deal.

The husband‚Äôs temper flared. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done,‚Äù he said, standing abruptly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre canceling Christmas here. I‚Äôm not doing this.‚Äù

The wife looked startled, her eyes wide. ‚ÄúWait, what do you mean?‚Äù she asked, her tone shifting from casual to alarmed.

The husband didn‚Äôt answer. He grabbed his keys and walked out the door, slamming it behind him.

The streets were quiet as the husband drove aimlessly, his thoughts racing. He replayed the week in his head: the countless times he had voiced his discomfort, the lines he had drawn, and the wife‚Äôs failure to act. She had done this before‚Äîprioritized others over him, ignored his boundaries to keep the peace with her family.

In his heart, he knew the wife wasn‚Äôt malicious. She wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt him. But her inability to make hard choices, to say no, to prioritize their relationship over everyone else‚Äôs demands, cut deeply.

It wasn‚Äôt just today. It was every time she had put others first. And as much as the husband wanted to speak those words aloud, to tell her how it felt to be overlooked in his own home, he couldn‚Äôt. He was too angry, too tired, and too hurt to find the words.

Eventually, his phone buzzed.

‚ÄúPlease come home,‚Äù the wife said softly when he answered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to fight. Let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

He hesitated but turned the car around.  


When the husband walked back into the house, the wife was sitting on the couch, waiting for him. Her hands were clasped tightly in her lap, and she looked up at him with a mixture of guilt and hope. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean for this to happen.‚Äù

The husband leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, his face unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù he asked flatly.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre upset,‚Äù the wife said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt trying to go against you. I just‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.‚Äù

The husband didn‚Äôt respond immediately. He thought about saying what was on his mind‚Äîthat she had chosen them over him, again, that her actions made him feel small in his own home. But instead, he just said, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

The wife looked at him, clearly searching for more, but he couldn‚Äôt give it to her. He was too drained. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to leave you alone,‚Äù she said after a moment.

‚ÄúYou already did,‚Äù the husband thought but didn‚Äôt say.

Instead, he nodded toward the door. ‚ÄúYou should go,‚Äù he said simply.

The wife hesitated, tears welling in her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back soon,‚Äù she said softly, and then she left.

The house was quiet again, the kind of silence that felt more oppressive than peaceful. The husband sat alone in the living room, the Christmas tree‚Äôs lights twinkling in the corner. He thought about their relationship, about all the compromises he had made over the years, and how little she seemed to understand the weight of what she had done today.

He didn‚Äôt doubt her love, but love wasn‚Äôt enough. Not when it came without the ability to make hard choices or respect the boundaries he had so carefully laid out.

As the hours passed, the husband reflected on the road ahead. If they were going to make this work, things would have to change. He couldn‚Äôt keep carrying the weight of their life alone, couldn‚Äôt keep bending while she stood still.

I mostly like natural processed, fruity, light roasts and brew 90% v60 pourovers, 10% french press. 

Bought their beans in December 2023 (I buy in bulk and freeze them, thaw 3-5 days' worth at a time). 

Then, I went to restock a couple weeks ago. And the same single origins that were so flavorful last year taste really underwhelming this time. Barely a trace of the tasting notes. Tried a couple of their cafes, 4-5 different beans and they're all just disappointing. 

I want to ask if anyone else has noticed the same or is it just me? 
My setup has been the same, tried playing around with grind sizes and temps but no luck. Even tried distilled water to check if the RO system has gotten worse over time, but I just can't get the fruity, smooth coffee from their beans as I did in the past. 

I did try a couple naturals from other roasters around Delhi, and they seem fine. 
This makes me think their beans are just not as good, and I really hope I'm wrong.

I wasn't used to them before that, but some doctor advised me to drink more caffeine to get my blood pressure to its normal rate as I suffered low blood pressure constantly, and we were afraid of meds as they have severe side effects, so I just added caffeine to my day. Although it didn't have that much of a positive or long-lasting impact on my blood pressure, it had turned into a habit.

I know I shouldn't have done that, especially with tea bec I have iron deficiency, but it was too late. **I got addicted!** the days I skipped tea/coffee, I suffered low blood pressure, I even fainted multiple times...

Fast forward, years later:

My addiction had gone worse, I had dose of 5 cups of tea a day and maybe 2 cups of coffee, it's severe but you know, being a programmer forces you to do that sometime!

Suddenly, but not surprisingly, I realized that high doses of caffeine for that much time has led me to have severe esophageal spasms, **that was where I stopped!**

The only time since then that I tried to drink a small cup of coffee was TRAUMATIZING! I had a little sip and vomited all day:\\

That was when I knew it is serious, and I can't just drink coffee anymore, for my whole life!

Life 10 years ago has disappeared, leaving us to cope with a ton of unprocessed grief that is repressed to make space for coping with rapid change. 

So, on 4th Jan, I‚Äôm inviting you to come as part of a sharing circle. Stories about buildings, roads, trees, eating fruit, food and everything that has been lost or changed. A space to share stories around witnessing ecological change. Stories from childhood memories . Stories around loss. Stories around shifting perspectives. 

There will also be a second part to this where we collectively process it though art. So come toshare and/or listen. Come to paint. Come to be. 

You can always choose to actively participate / not. 

Time: 3 PM
Date: Saturday, 4th January 2024
Location: Meetup in front of the Coffee Day Square , then we move inside.

TLDR: Sharing circle about how things have changed, especially ecologically. Intention - creating a space for this grief to exist, be acknowledged, processed.

üòá Be kind to each other!

* If you find you're complaining more and more about the game, perhaps it is time to consider moving on from the game

==================.¬†

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

* This applies to the ever-present concern about people selling hacked accounts with promises of millions/billions of gems, lives, and coins. Especially when such instances require you to turnover access, for even 1 minute, to your Facebook account.¬†**Never turn over access to your Facebook account to anyone!**
* In the game, if a sale, purchase, or feature sounds too good to be true.... then you probably misunderstand it! (Example, people who thought spending 75k on the Wish Box would get them 15 emojis)

==================.¬†

ü§îüßë‚Äçüé® Artwork never conveys meaning!

* You cannot assume box artwork conveys any intent of its contents! Box artwork is recycled, and they regularly use the same artwork at the exact same time for two boxes!
* GOOD NEWS, in mid-2024 a change was made so¬†**tapping boxes in most parts of the game shows what's inside it!**

==================.¬†

2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£‚ùì‚ùì I made ""25 Days of FAQs"" in December 2023 in the Facebook Group where I've been an admin, and the insights are still valid and good reminders on many parts of the game!

* [https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AmN67TARv/](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AmN67TARv/?__cft__[0]=AZVf0G2kOdD3nCProsj_T-bSXxQ2wc-r7JzplZCz-xnrFaycRRctMUU3VJB0csybra-CXJSbcgw6PPCP--eFJcJL9NkgkOjszvvlXYeJ00yI8ievQ0_z-mdKefxB-ubGEJOmMRS8OIovnB5DmE9VM98c-4R0Cl1B5-vS76m10xfbYB5YzwPMed4irV3gTQ9Oo_4&__tn__=-UK-R)

==================.¬†

‚ôæÔ∏èüíΩ Constant downloads means free up space on your device

* Every week, for almost 3 years, now someone posts asking if others get a daily game download. You need to free up device space when this happens.
* Here's my Facebook Group post dedicated to this topic: [https://www.facebook.com/.../7418.../posts/2396275937179543/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/741864132620740/posts/2396275937179543/?__cft__[0]=AZVf0G2kOdD3nCProsj_T-bSXxQ2wc-r7JzplZCz-xnrFaycRRctMUU3VJB0csybra-CXJSbcgw6PPCP--eFJcJL9NkgkOjszvvlXYeJ00yI8ievQ0_z-mdKefxB-ubGEJOmMRS8OIovnB5DmE9VM98c-4R0Cl1B5-vS76m10xfbYB5YzwPMed4irV3gTQ9Oo_4&__tn__=-UK-R)

==================.¬†

üõë‚ÅâÔ∏è **Two things that just are never going to happen**, search for my posts (made YEARS ago, in the Facebook group where I've been an admin for sure, but also should be on reddit)) if you want the full reasons why:

* Tarzan/Marvel/Roger Rabbit emojis  (see links in the comment thread of this reddit post!)
* Series 4 (or more) boxes

==================.¬†

üîçüîé When an emoji shows as ""Now Available"" that means it is literally available currently¬†*somewhere*!

* It might not be observable, like in a box in a part of a sale you can't reach (yet) or a prize at the end of rainbow falls when you are still on the main event
* Sometimes the game's internal clock is off, too, and ""now available"" can refer to things happening ""today"" from an Australia perspective), but tomorrow from a USA perspective

==================.¬†

üòîü•≥ Will \[insert emoji name\] ever come back?

* Yes, no emoji has been fully retired from the game.
* But don't expect the newest emojis introduced behind a big paywall to be available easily/cheaply for a long time.¬†**Often the shift of a hard-to-get emoji being easier/cheaper to obtain takes 6-12 months (or longer)!**

==================.¬†

üëØ After the friend invite reward process overhaul in June 2024,¬†*EXISTING players DON'T HELP you get friend rewards anymore!*

* **Friending people already in a Facebook group or sub-reddit WILL NOT help you get prizes anymore**¬†(because they already have the game installed)
* Only¬†*new players*¬†who download the game via your invite link, and ""complete the tutorial"" will get you credit. It is unclear what ""complete the tutorial"" means, JC says at least finish level 5, but player experience suggests it may be more like level 10, 12, or even 15 to 20

==================.¬†

üßºüì¶ **Patience on data reporting in the future!**

* Data mining is VOLUNTEER work, and researching, content development, and posting takes a LOT of time.
* Respect limits on what is produced! Everyone wants ""just one more thing"", but a data miner can (and should) draw the line way earlier than I did!
* Plus,¬†***one of many reasons I'm retiring is the now limited planning value that advance info provides***. For at least a year, the event requirements to unlock the last map or two usually require emojis that aren't easy to level up, typically aren't in the Diamond box, and often are platinum/crystal/cozy craft emojis that don't have emoji charges available to obtain and strategically use anyway. Lucky Gold Boxes haven't been relevant for that current cycle's events for at least 6-9 months either.
* So, we are left with.... advance knowledge that a) simply confirms disappointment about events or b) just explains how much money or gems is needed to play said events. The advance knowledge doesn't really help one with much strategy/planning anymore. Fun to know, sure! Helpful strategically, not so much! This is also why I support the shift to more ""weekly"" reporting of future content.
* My gift to all of you this Holiday Season (and parting words of wisdom as I inch closer to retirement from the game)!

i used up a few more empties these past few months than in the first half of the year! list and reviews below:

1) hairitage curl foam -- this is the best curl foam that i've tried for defining wash 'n goes on type 4 hair. i don't do wash 'n goes anymore, but i would consider repurchasing this for a rod set or something like that. WRP

  
2) cerave renewing SA cleanser -- i bought this because i thought my acne was caused by not cleaning my pores enough. it wasn't. WNRP

  
3) cerave hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser -- this is my favourite cleanser, which probably tells you how deep i am in the skincare game (seven centimetres at most). it's gentle, doesn't sting my eyes, and removes makeup. it doesn't actually turn into foam though, fair warning. WRP

  
4) dove crushed macadamia & rice milk scrub -- this is a super soft and gentle scrub, which is great for me because i have sensitive skin. it's also not sugar based, which is even better because my drain is extremely old and i got ants one time from sugar scrubs not rinsing down properly. i don't use scrubs often, but when i do, i would probably only use this kind. WRP 

  
5) chapstick minty delight -- it's literally just lip balm, and not a very good one. WNRP

  
6) giovanni tea tree triple treat shampoo -- i bought this for the tingle, and it did just that and literally nothing else. WNRP

  
7) aveeno lotion -- it smells kinda like wheat germ, which is a plus to me. it also doesn't feel greasy like a lot of lotions i've tried. WRP

  
8) mielle white peony leave in conditioner -- this is my holy grail leave-in conditioner. i'm surprised i only went through one bottle, as in previous years i would go through 5 or 6. it's not the most economical and also impossible to properly recycle, but i still love it. WRP

  
9) whole foods jojoba oil -- this is an all-over oil; hair, body, everything. i use this as a one-step skincare routine when i'm feeling extra lazy and cannot be bothered. WRP

  
10) chapstick vanilla mint -- another mediocre lip balm. WNRP

  
11) dove clinical strength deodorant -- honestly? it was just okay. i didn't feel that it worked super well or did anything that another deodorant couldn't do. WNRP  
12) biolate ultra hydra source mask -- i got this half off, and i'm very happy i did, bc if i had paid full price i would have been pissed. it has really good slip and made my hair feel soft, but the sheer amount of fragrance was too much. i also have other deep conditioners that i like more at more reasonable price points. WNRP

  
13) spa april sugar coffee body scrub x2 -- i got this from the dollar store, and you get what you pay for. the scrub had hardened to a rock-like texture, and i had to break it up with my hands to get it to actually spread. then, it felt like rubbing sand all over my skin, which was unpleasant. lastly, every part that i used the scrub on was covered in such a thick layer of petroleum that i was sticky after getting out of the shower. the only positive was that it smelled like coffee and could be used in one shower. 0/10. WNRP

  
14) neutrogena moisture shine lip soother -- this was my spf lip gloss, and i love it dearly. unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and it has since been discontinued/reformulated. WRP

  
15) dove deep moisture body wash -- i was surprised by how much i liked this. it smells almost milky and the light fragrance doesn't irritate my sensitive nose. it was fairly moisturising, and some days i wouldn't even put lotion on after using this (although it doesn't hold up that well for moisture long-term). WRP  
16) dove deodorant -- after using three of this deodorant in a different scent earlier this year, i was surprised by how much i hated the scent of this one. it really sucked. WNRP

  
17) cetaphil moisturising cream -- this is my holy grail everything moisturiser. i use it for my face and body. WRP

  
18) giovanni smooth as silk xtreme mask -- extremely mediocre hair mask, and not a lot of product besides. WNRP

  
19) giovanni 50:50 conditioner -- this was good for detangling and little else. the construction of the bottle meant it couldn't be squeezed, the formula was too thick to actually run down the sides of the bottle, and cleaning it would be unpleasant if not outright impossible. i loved it as a detangler, and would probably just repurchase a different size.

1hm6inl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1hm6inl/you_arent_a_bad_teacher_you_are_an_unsupported/,"You aren‚Äôt a bad teacher, you are an unsupported teacher. ","I‚Äôve held off posting this but what better time than Christmas, right? 

I am a 28 year old, 6th year, SPED teacher.  I started my career in a Middle School ‚Äúself contained‚Äù room.  21 students, 8 paras, a life skills apartment, a daily coffee cart, a chicken coop where we sold the eggs to the community for ‚Äújob skills‚Äù.  Basically, my plate was full but I had support and ran it well.  Paperwork and meetings kept me ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù many days, but it worked out. 

I moved 2 hours away (got married) and started and a tiny elementary school in a large district.  My first year I had 6 students and 2 paras in an ‚ÄúAutism self-contained‚Äù classroom.  One student was eventually so aggressive that she gave herself and 2 staff members concussion and was eventually sent to a hospital setting the following year.  No support was given, but with 6 students we made it through. 
This year,  I started with 1 para and 6 very high needs students with extreme behaviors.  Elopement, destruction, aggression, eating dangerous items, the list goes on.  I then got 4 new 5 year olds from August-October.  Students who enrolled for gen ed only to realize in MINUTES that they needed further evaluation.  All diagnosed with ASD and placed in my room with 0 early intervention or support at home.  Almost like the kiddos ‚Äúslipped through the cracks‚Äù or their parents didn‚Äôt know what to look for to raise questions.  Anyway, that made school negative considering they had never been in a structured setting with other kids and suddenly had expectations.  As expected, this added a whole new level of behaviors to our already high-needs classroom.  Still 1 teacher and 1 para.  
Despite locks on everything, removing any toys that could be a hazard, creating the ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù for school for our new students who started late, and being hyper vigilant‚Ä¶ it was still pure chaos. We didn‚Äôt get lunches, I didn‚Äôt get a plan, even bathroom breaks were ‚Äúscary‚Äù since it left 1 staff member in the room with 7-9 students who were unpredictable. 

I collected extremely detailed data, called meetings with parents and special services, had an AMAZING principal who volunteered so much of her day to be an extra set of hands and eyes and advocated for us daily.  
We finally got a 2nd para.  But our ration was still 3:1, 3:1, and 4:1 when at least 3 of our students required 1:1 just to be considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.  

Of course, the day I dreaded finally came. A student eloped from the gym.  Ran across a parking lot, down a hill, (through a creek that was luckily dried up), and into a neighboring home‚Äôs backyard.   I was distraught and remember taking off after the student, coming to a complete stop and thinking ‚Äúwhat about the other 9?!!‚Äù who my paras had.  I demanded a meeting with the team and director of SS.  They declined the invitation.  The parents were so very understanding, considering this had happened in their own home many times with extreme safety measures at every exit. They demanded a 1:1, I said ai totally agreed.  They thanked me for advocating for him, despite receiving any support. 
2 months go on, data was collected (pages and pages), all interventions were attempted on the ‚Äúumbrella‚Äù list they shared with me.  Weekly I would invite them to a meeting, no response.  Daily I would call, nothing.  Then on the off chance I got someone on the phone I was told to ‚Äúremember my why‚Äù and ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù.  After pushback, and making it known their actions were illegal, the tables turned.  I was suddenly incompetent and needed better classroom management.  They shared thoughts and opinions throughout other schools about me and my team.  (very unprofessional). 
I continued to show up, showing up and leaving in tears most days.  I felt like a failure.  I had poured my heart into these kids and they were not gaining anything.  I felt pulled in 50 directions every second of the day.  No one would listen, no support was offered.  I hit my breaking point and applied for other positions outside of teaching.  

After feeling like a failure, trying everything, researching in evenings and weekends, setting up meetings to be ghosted, and still making no progress.. I realized it wasn‚Äôt me.  You can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup.  You can‚Äôt successfully run a 7 man operations with 3 people.  Without support from those who have ‚Äúpull‚Äù, your hands are tied.  As long as parents don‚Äôt complain or you aren‚Äôt nearing a lawsuit, they don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre sinking or floating.  Until your problems become their problems, they don‚Äôt matter.  

So‚Ä¶ to those who called me incompetent, made me question myself and my sanity, failed to support me, and let me ‚Äúdrown‚Äù‚Ä¶ I just accepted a position as our states ‚ÄúSpecial Education Support Specialist‚Äù where I travel to help other teachers.  Not only that, my salary is 3x higher and I don‚Äôt live in fight-or-flight mode everyday.  I don‚Äôt cry anymore, and I am supported.  

So, you aren‚Äôt a bad teacher.  You just aren‚Äôt being given the support you need to do the bare minimum.  If this sounds familiar, get out and find somewhere that appreciates all you have to offer.

* Whisk the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer, or by hand with a whisk, until the mixture is smooth, pale yellow, and forms ribbons, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in the Strega and rum, then mix in the mascarpone, about ¬Ω cup at a time, being careful not to overwhip the mixture so it does not separate.
* In a separate bowl, whip the cream until it forms firm peaks. Carefully fold the cream into the mascarpone mixture with a rubber spatula.
* Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the coffee-soaked ladyfingers. Soak the remaining ladyfingers and arrange them over the mascarpone, then spread the remaining mascarpone mixture on top. Use a fine-mesh strainer or sifter to sprinkle the cocoa over the top, covering the mascarpone mixture completely.

28M here. Went to 2 dates with a 28F, which went really really good. First was coffee with walk afterwads (which ended up dinner),  and second was shopping and dinner after as well.

The thing is, we are both on holidays (last date was on 18th dec), and last week texting slowed down (I usually initiate). We said could be cool a 3rd date when second ended, but didn't set a specific time window. She is coming back on 2nd January and myself on 1st.

So here are my 2 questions:

1 - About texting: I wished good travel, and I would love to hear from her trip when she has free time. She texted me actually with some pics next day, but the thing is, I feel like I kinda ""forced"" her to text me even of she doesn't feel like. Maybe I am wrong, would it be unwise to clarify to her to only do it when she wants to? (this might be a wrong move...)

2 - About third date: any ideas? After almost 3 weeks perhaps the connection colded out, so had in mind a Museum + lunch, but don't know if it's great to re-connect and talk about our trips.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Merry Christmas! Or Happy Holidays!

What are you up to for the holidays and the new year?? I'd love to meet someone new! It could be just a new friendship, an acquaintance, or more! We'll see how it goes!

I am a very active guy with so many interests and things I am enthusiastic about so we'll just have to talk to get into it! I go to the gym most days, tend to be a morning person, start every day with some coffee even though I don't think the caffeine does anything for me, love to read more than one book at a time, and loves pretty much all outdoor activities lol. When I'm not doing reading or outdoors doing something, I enjoy movies, tv shows, working on my house, playing with my pupper, cooking, listening to music while singing and dancing!

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma.

Also, the read in general.","‚ÄúThe hamper‚Äôs filling up, you know,‚Äù said Alvarez, sat at the couch, can of corned beef in one hand and an old, crooked spoon in the other. He was facing the window and digging it straight out of the aluminum cylinder like a soldier.

‚ÄúOh, sorry,‚Äù said Ms. Villaflor his roommate with her cup of coffee at the table. ‚ÄúThe weather won‚Äôt let up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeather never lets up, does it?‚Äù he said, shoving another stringy heap of meat into his mouth. It was growing colder by the minute.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she stirred her drink and sat down on the kitchen counter. Moments passed.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ How‚Äôs finding work?‚Äù

Her eyes darted up to him. It seemed like a weird question. ‚ÄúI sent out another email to the pharmacy. Got back this AI generated response. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre even still looking for someone.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù Alvarez thought, ‚ÄúDo you have work experience?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe, uh, start somewhere smaller then. Barangay health office perhaps, they‚Äôll find a use for you,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI checked it out. They‚Äôre underfunded.‚Äù

‚ÄúHospital?‚Äù Alvarez got up with the can. ‚ÄúPublic hospital, I mean,‚Äù he clarified with his hands, turning toward her.

‚ÄúSent out an email to them as well. Uh, why are you asking?‚Äù she looked at him.

‚ÄúOh, just curious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your problem,‚Äù she laughed awkwardly.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt,‚Äù he shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours.‚Äù Then, he went and put the can back in the fridge and the fork in the sink.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeaving?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving the NCR. I‚Äôm going back to my province.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, moving out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, we just renewed the lease three months ago,‚Äù she worriedly spoke.

Alvarez scratched his head and began to pace around the room. ‚ÄúI know, I know. I‚Äôm not leaving yet. No, not immediately but,‚Äù he paused, looking out the window, ‚Äúyou should factor that in to‚Ä¶ your plans. You know what I mean.‚Äù

The tree branches outside scraped at the windows as the wind grew stronger with the falling of dark. Villaflor was visibly uneased with that announcement. She put her coffee down and began fidgeting her feet hanging off the counter.

‚ÄúAre you taking the train?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúWhat train?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo go to your province.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no railway from the NCR to Ilocos!‚Äù he almost laughed. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs gonna be a lot of walking, I suppose.‚Äù

We've had some fights and all, but things seems to workout great between us.  
This holiday we've been not seeing each other at all and I missed her and I realized that I don't wanna lose her.

I thought of taking her to another date, first we can go try indoor ice skating, then go to a coffee shop nearby, there I will mention what made me like her so much...then drop the question : will you be my girlfriend ?

Is that a good approach ? or is it too much that she will think I'm too emotional and shii ?",4,1735151863.0,Life,7,0.83,False

Are you people all that rich? The question is really simple.   
I'm getting daily summary posts from reddit and like 99% if not 100% people are celebrating their new Nespresso Vertuo Machine  (I found first post somebody got Original Line machine just today, but all others are about Vertuo).

Why is that? Why to play into Nestle Corporate greed and spending unnecessarily your money? Are you really all that rich? (I'm not). Or are the prices in USA so different from Canada?   
It isn't about the price of the machine. That's completely unimportant. There are sales and deals and after all it is only one time investment.  What gets you at the end is the price of the coffee of course.   
I don't particularly like Starbucks, but just for comparison, so we can compare apples to apples rather than apples to oranges:  
Box of Vertuo Pike Place Roast for $11.47 (CAD) for EIGHT capsules = about $1.40 per cup of coffee  
Box or Original Pike Place Roast for $6.99 (CAD) for TEN capsules = about 70 cents per cup of coffee  
It is literally half the price for THE SAME QUALITY of coffee. 

So I really don't understand. This post is absolutely NOT meant to derogate anyone, it is meant to help me to understand why so many people are throwing their money into Nestle corporate coffers. 

You know, a few years back, Keurig tried to pull the same stunt over its customers by introducing Keurig 2.0 when the patent for the original K-Cups has expired. But learned the hard way that consumers wouldn't accept that. People found very quickly how to either hack the machine that it was accepting noname pods (that's what I did) or how to modify pods using the preserved lid from one original pod, so the machine would be fooled. Moreover, Keurig sales dropped and they very quickly abandoned the whole idea of Keurig 2.0

So I'm curious to learn why Nespresso lovers (ranks of which I've joined about half a year ago) are playing into Nestle hands when they try to do the same - as soon as the patent for original capsules had expired, they invented Nespresso Vertue - smartly changing the shape, so no hacking, nor fooling is possible. And while original pods could be made by anyone thus the price is being pushed very low, the Vertuo pods are still patented and can be made only under Nestle Licence, thus very expensive. 

There is NO difference in quality of the actual coffee. Really, I tried cup of the same coffee blend from both machines and while there might be difference in the lab testing (I wouldn't know about that), there was no difference for my taste buds. 

So, why, people? Hope it opens discussion, not a fight :-) ",0,1735151211.0,nespresso,17,0.14,False

*Ahem*, let yours truly, the UninterestedPirate, guide you through why these be more than just a mere accessory for shielding ye peepers:

- **Sustainability at the Helm:** These aren't your run-of-the-mill, plastic trinkets that contribute to Davey Jones's locker! Nay! Johnny Fly Sunglasses are the captains of eco-friendly craftsmanship, boasting materials such as wood and cotton-based acetate. Environmentally conscious and as stylish as a siren's song - shiver me timbers!

- **Vision Like a Telescope:** Speaking of sights, these lenses are like looking through a spyglass sharpened by Poseidon himself. With polarized lenses that'd make even Blackbeard weep with clarity, you'd spot the glimmer of gold on a deserted isle faster than you can say ""Blimey!""

- **Custom Fittings? Aye Aye!**: Bid adieu to the one-size-tries-to-fit-all that fits none hitch, mateys. Johnny Fly ensures a bespoke fit for your noggin. They‚Äôll fashion your specs to be as snug as a hammock in the crow's nest, no fear of them slipping whilst swashbuckling or swaying to a sea shanty.

- **Warranty Like a Treasure Map's Promise:** They're offering a lifetime guarantee that would rival the trustiest parrot. If your shades take a dive, you won't be walking the plank financially. That's a pirate's pledge, no bamboozle!

Still think these sunnies are just for blocking the glare from the seven seas? Nay, they be a statement, a flag of your persona, fluttering proudly from the mast as you navigate the waves of style and sustainability.

Before you scurry off to locate your very own pair, let it be known that pirates are no strangers to risky endeavors. But with Johnny Fly, the risk be taken from ye shoulders and placed firmly upon their own. Think of it as charting unknown waters with a trusted crew; you focus on the horizon while they handle the squalls.

So, whether you be lounging on the deck or searching for booty in the concrete jungles, raise your glasses (your Johnny Fly Sunglasses, that is) and toast to a horizon full of adventures, clear views, and the wind of mother nature‚Äôs approval at our backs!

Now, scoop up yer compass and spyglass (or just your credit card) and set a course for Johnny Fly's treasure trove. And who knows, you might just be the trendiest pirate on the Spanish Main‚Äîor the local coffee shop. Arrrr you ready? üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüåøüï∂",1,1735151072.0,FashionFuture,0,1.0,False

The location I want to put the shop is on the end of the street, you have to pass it to get to the school and there is no other cafe or anything similar for a few miles.

1hm5qnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hm5qnf/are_you_ready_to_read_about_middleaged_people/,Are you ready to read about middle-aged people?! (51f/55m),"When you get to be this age and you have made it this far without being married and having children, without doing anything that looks like the ""traditional"" path of modern relationships, it's hard to find people to weigh in on your romantic situations! I'm hoping you open-minded youngsters can offer some insight, or maybe some dudes in my age group can help me figure out what's going on.

**TL;DR:** Very satisfying, respectful, fun, healthy, exclusive relationship ended after 2.5 years because he ""felt himself pulling away."" No arguments, disagreements about anything. Seems just like a case of avoidant attachment style & I wonder if there is a way to go back.

I'm 51, F, and heteroflexible. For two and a half years I was involved with a straight man who is now 55. We're both intelligent, good-looking professionals. Neither of us have been married or have kids; neither of us wanted those things either. We met on an app, were involved with each other exclusively the whole time, and then he ended things last April. (Yes. I've been ruminating on this situation ever since and I really miss him and all that our relationship brought.)

I've had some pretty bad relationships, made dumb choices, but I've done a lot of work on myself, so I tend to be straightforward about my wants/needs in a relationship, I realize I don't have ""traditional American values,"" and as I have gotten older I have appreciated relationships that allow me a lot of independence. I don't want to live under the same roof with anyone, not going on vacations with a partner is not a dealbreaker, and, in fact, it's much nicer to not have to intertwine my family and my partner (and their family). **This relationship I was in checked all those boxes & he felt very much the same.**

This dude is also very forthcoming, magnanimous, honest. He's got literally no guile. For a few months I thought he was too nice for me! So please, when you are analyzing and giving feedback, please don't lead off with him being full of baloney or stringing me along or having a whole harem of other women. **I have zero reason not to trust him completely.**

After our first couple of dates, but before anything had gotten really physical, we did have the ""what are you looking for on the app?"" conversation. At the time I was open to anything between a hookup and marriage (lol), but looking for something longer-term, but with my preferred level of independence. He, on the other hand, didn't really have something specific he was looking for, but said he was not a long-term kind of guy, not a ""meet the parents"" kind of person, etc. He was happy to get to know me and enjoy each other for as long as it made sense. **He was totally up front**, saying he hadn't had a long-term relationship in about a decade and saying that typically started ""feeling himself pulling away"" after a while, even if a situation was going well. It sounded like **he lacked relationship endurance, but not that he was avoidant of commitment per se.**

Well, we went out for three months, and then six, and then a year....and then two years, and then two and a half. I can't say I wasn't thinking often ""aha! we might have broken the spell!"" But I tried to play it cool and not push the issue; I enjoyed the times we had and for once did not start getting ahead of myself and thinking way down the road. A couple of times there were wobbles, when I could feel him pulling away. When that happened, a conversation happened (although I can't remember who brought it up!) where he would say all these lovely, amazing things about me, but then that he wasn't sure how much longer he could keep doing what we were doing. He would say he never expected things to last as long as they had, but he was glad. He just didn't see this going on forever and ever since he knew from past experience that he just wouldn't be able to.

**This was probably the most respectful, honest, fun, relaxed, peaceful, fulfilling (in SO many ways) relationship I've ever had.** I felt seen, fully appreciated--for so many of the parts of me that are most important to me. We have similar energies, like doing a lot of the same things, hate the same kind of people (lol, it's important in a relationship!), had the same needs in a relationship schedule, and were both incredibly vulnerable and emotionally intimate with one another. Jeez, we laughed so much! And damn, when you are a middle aged person who likes having sex with people with real penises...finding a nice one that functions well and reliably is not guaranteed, so this was an added bonus! **For two and a half years, we talked and talked without a single awkward pause. We never had a single disagreement**, much less an argument! I never begged him to come to a work thing that he didn't want to. I didn't have to put off some other more interesting weekend plan because he wanted to watch a sports thing. Everything just worked. I didn't want for anything. And from what I could tell, he was satisfied as well.

Here's something really lovely about how we could communicate: Although we had a standing date every Saturday night, if one of us didn't feel up to it (physically, being low on social energy, whatever), canceling was always an option because we didn't want to hang out if one of us couldn't be 100% present. It wasn't flaky, it was respectful. Much better than being with someone who would throw a fit if you tried to cancel or who would insist on carrying on with plans even if they were in a complete shit mood.

So all continued very fun and silly and honest and fulfilling until last April. **He had finally felt himself ""pull away"" beyond the point where he couldn't snap back.** He said all the things--""I love you, I care about you so much, you're so funny, I love how you brain works, you're so sexy, I have so much fun with you, there's no one else, I love your dog, but I just can't show up in the way that I have been."" He has never given me any indication that I've done something wrong, that I'm not right for him, etc.  
And...I don't know what to say... Since April I've just been bouncing all over with my feelings. I'm *angry* that he can't get his shit together and see that we don't have a lot of opportunities in this world to find someone at our age whom we don't just tolerate, but we love (in our own way). Not to mention, finding someone who can embrace a relationship that not everyone would find to be 'enough.' **It's** ***baffling*** **to me that someone would reject a good thing (and that is where my utter lack of understanding comes in)**. I'm so *sad* to imagine he thinks he's better off alone than letting me down (he's convinced I'm not fulfilled, no matter how much I tell him otherwise). And extremely sad that I don't have his same presence in my life as before--both for how he made me feel, and for the fun we had together. I'm *humiliated* to think he might be with someone else for a fling when we could be continuing to build a history (I understand it, but it's still painful). And very foolishly, I remain *hopeful* that he will 'come to his senses' and realize this is a pretty great situation that we have.

I've only seen him once since April. Just after Thanksgiving I invited him to coffee. We met and talked and shared a sandwich...for **three and a half hours! Straight talking**, no breaks. Getting caught up on all sorts of things. We fell right back into our old jokes and mannerisms. Longest hello/goodbye hugs I've had in years. He asked very specific questions about the things I care about, showing again how attentive and caring he is. We laughed a lot together, but I cried my eyes out the whole way home, so upset about how I had lost this person. **I think I've come to realize he is my best friend.** Sadly, however, I can't be satisfied with ""just friends,"" even if it's *best* friends. **I don't have access to 100% of him any more, only having 50% of him is painful, and I suffered in the months when I cut off all contact to 0%.**

**So what advice or information am I seeking? Oof.**  
Is avoidant attachment style really a thing? Can someone change out of it?  
Is there a chance he could 'come to his senses'? Is there a magic spell I could use to hasten that?  
Is he just 'really screwed up,' despite how self-aware he is of his screwed-upped-ness?  
**Really, just any respectful & gentle feedback is really helpful**. The holidays are rough for me (note that I've written this on Xmas morning) and it's a time when I struggle with my need to have quiet alone time and also feeling too isolated.   
Thanks everyone. :)

1hm5qhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lactoseintolerant/comments/1hm5qhl/why_dont_they_sell_milk_pills_at_food_places/,Why don‚Äôt they sell milk pills at food places? ,"Hi, so about 2 years I became lactose intolerant(weirdly enough, me and my t√≠a both go covid and became LI right after recovering) and since then I find eating dairy at my favorite restaurants or quick service food like Taco Bell or Starbucks to be the hardest. I don‚Äôt really know how much dairy they add and it‚Äôs not always consistent, like cheese on salad sometimes I get a little sometimes they pile it on(I even used to do this when I worked at a Panera cause I loved cheese I figured it was nice to add a little more). 

I‚Äôve thought about this mostly from like a fun idea or like a what if, but are there specific reasons that food places don‚Äôt offer milk pills? Like at ice cream
parlors or coffee shops selling it as side item- like Starbucks has gum to get rid of coffee breath? 

I feel like it would be a good offering and also like a nice surprise that could be marketable. The reason I can think of so far are 

- Bathroom talk with food places, they don‚Äôt want to think about the toilet when eating (but like I‚Äôm not on the toilet if you offer me milk pills üòÅ)

- Dosing/Individual Needs for the amount of milk pills one person needs can vary (but if it‚Äôs like a small bottle or package of milk pills the consumer can choose how many to eat)

- Legalities???? Not a lawyer so don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs like laws about selling supplements with food (tho I see vitamins offered at some health smoothie places and like some gyms sell food and health supplements together) - this is USA thinking but maybe another country it‚Äôs different??

Clearly with all my ()‚Äôs I‚Äôve thought of a lot of work arounds/reasons they should offer milk pills üòÖ But I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs anyone else who has thought the same or like if y‚Äôall have anything I‚Äôm not thinking of. ",2,1735150292.0,lactoseintolerant,3,0.75,False
