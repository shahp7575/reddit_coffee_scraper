1im2tde,https://www.reddit.com/r/gurgaon/comments/1im2tde/four_year_old_rendezvous_still_haunts_me_please/,Four year old rendezvous still haunts me. Please help.,"TLDR - I had a 5 week thing with a man I met during a vacation in a mountain town. I believed our connection was meaningful, but he left saying, ""All good things must end,"" and then disappeared without contact. Four years later, I still feel hurt and used, struggling to move past the experience. 

I'm embarrassed that I even have to make a post about this.
I was in my early 20s, young and naive, totally unaware of modern dating, its perils, or f*kboys. I was living in a small, stunning, and peaceful mountain town on a long solo vacation. I met this man who was also solo tripping in the same town. He was tall, good-looking, had a good job n our hobbies n intellect matched. Loneliness was catching up to me because the place was secluded, and there weren't many tourists, maybe this had a part to play.

So, this guy and I started hanging out on a weekly basis and spent the weekends together since both of us were working and were busy during weekdays. We used to go for coffee/food, take long walks in the forest, sometimes go on bike rides to nearby villages, and also got physically intimate. That was the best s*x of my life, also because the guy said that he was fairly experienced and he was a real giver in bed. I'd cook a lot too for him because he really liked food made by me. He'd tell me his life stories.

So, all in all, serene gorgeous mountain town, good-looking lad pleasuring me in so many ways, and I was completely oblivious to the feelings I was developing yet. I never thought it was necessary to ""discuss"" things because, as I said, from where I was coming, it's implied that if you are doing such stuff together, it's romantic. I didn't know, as per modern dating, you need to have a discussion to label it as ""exclusive."" I thought since both of us are equally in this and s*x has also happened, so obviously, it's not just strangers anymore.

This continued for straight five weeks until it was time for him to leave. The last week we were together, my feelings finally hit me. I was really overwhelmed by my feelings, didn't want him to leave, and I was hoping he at least felt 10% of what I do because how come both of us shared every moment together, but it's only me ending up with all the feelings.

The moment came when he was leaving, and I was crying inconsolably nonstop. And his eyes were blank or maybe confused about where this is coming from. I felt so embarrassed in that moment because I could see he feels nothing. I felt such a fool right there and then n realized what I have done to myself. Finally, when I stopped crying, I tried to tell him about my feelings. He shushed me even before I could say everything and just said, ""All good things must end."" That hurt like a grenade. In that moment, I realized how damn one-sided it is, and I was nothing more than a vacation f*k for him.

While he was leaving, he said that he'll call me once he reaches the other place and send me pictures and videos from there because that place was on my bucket list too, but as soon as he left, he just disappeared. Never any call, never anything. It hurt a lot because even if not something romantic, if you share that much time and moments with somebody, you'll at least treat them like basic human beings and can at least try to be friendly rather than disappearing completely. That made me feel so fucked up for the longest time. Because I used to ask him for his favorite food, get ingredients, spend a lot of time cooking, would dress up well, and other small things for him.

I have a lot of self-respect, so after that line of his, ""all good things must end,"" it was very clear to me that I don't have to bother him one bit. I've already done enough for him. NOW, it's been a full four years, but I still have that super fresh in my memory. It just doesn't go away. The chilly weather, at times snowfall or rains, all the moments spent, bonfire, cooking, laughter, and the incredible physical intimacy, just how good he was in bed. Now it's more about the hurt. I really wish that I don't remember him as much as I still do and already forget about him. Want to make it clear I don't miss him in any romantic way like I want him or anything because a person who can switch off like that has to be a sociopath. So romantic feelings went away long back. But because of the feeling of being so dumb to get used like that doesn't go away. That was introduction to modern dating f*uckery. Since then I have guarded my heart well but this one thing that happened long back, I really want to forget and forgive myself for it. ",1,1739182136.0,gurgaon,0,1.0,False

What I'm looking for is a fantasy world where the PCs are, at least part of the time, 'normal people'. Normal in the sense of they aren't epic world-saving heroes, they just, yknow, run a little cafe and need to pay rent and manage unruly customers. Maybe a bit of urban adventuring on the side.

I'm aware I could use Pathfinder or some other system I'm familiar with and then tack on some subsystems, but I'm wondering if there's anything tailor made? Or at least that I could mash into the Pathfinder rules instead of making my own subsystems.

I'm aware of Stewpot: tales from a fantasy tavern. It's adorable, but not quite what I'm looking for as it's a bit too chill and seems to be for one shots. I'd like this to be a campaign.

I considered Urban Shadows but it seems too grim, and Cypher with It's Only Magic seems like it might be too lightweight. Like, if there's some kind of business-running mechanics that'd be great.

1im2o3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1im2o3f/four_year_old_rendezvous_still_haunts_me_please/,Four year old rendezvous still haunts me. Please help,"TLDR - I had a 5 week thing with a man I met during a vacation in a mountain town. I believed our connection was meaningful, but he left saying, ""All good things must end,"" and then disappeared without contact. Four years later, I still feel hurt and used, struggling to move past the experience. 

I'm embarrassed that I even have to make a post about this.I was in my early 20s, young and naive, totally unaware of modern dating, its perils, or f*kboys. I was living in a small, stunning, and peaceful mountain town on a long solo vacation. I met this man who was also solo tripping in the same town. He was tall, good-looking, had a good job n our hobbies n intellect matched. Loneliness was catching up to me because the place was secluded, and there weren't many tourists, maybe this had a part to play.

So, this guy and I started hanging out on a weekly basis and spent the weekends together since both of us were working and were busy during weekdays. We used to go for coffee/food, take long walks in the forest, sometimes go on bike rides to nearby villages, and also got physically intimate. That was the best s*x of my life, also because the guy said that he was fairly experienced and he was a real giver in bed. I'd cook a lot too for him because he really liked food made by me. He'd tell me his life stories.

So, all in all, serene gorgeous mountain town, good-looking lad pleasuring me in so many ways, and I was completely oblivious to the feelings I was developing yet. I never thought it was necessary to ""discuss"" things because, as I said, from where I was coming, it's implied that if you are doing such stuff together, it's romantic. I didn't know, as per modern dating, you need to have a discussion to label it as ""exclusive."" I thought since both of us are equally in this and s*x has also happened, so obviously, it's not just strangers anymore.

This continued for straight five weeks until it was time for him to leave. The last week we were together, my feelings finally hit me. I was really overwhelmed by my feelings, didn't want him to leave, and I was hoping he at least felt 10% of what I do because how come both of us shared every moment together, but it's only me ending up with all the feelings.

The moment came when he was leaving, and I was crying inconsolably nonstop. And his eyes were blank or maybe confused about where this is coming from. I felt so embarrassed in that moment because I could see he feels nothing. I felt such a fool right there and then n realized what I have done to myself. Finally, when I stopped crying, I tried to tell him about my feelings. He shushed me even before I could say everything and just said, ""All good things must end."" That hurt like a grenade. In that moment, I realized how damn one-sided it is, and I was nothing more than a vacation f*k for him.

While he was leaving, he said that he'll call me once he reaches the other place and send me pictures and videos from there because that place was on my bucket list too, but as soon as he left, he just disappeared. Never any call, never anything. It hurt a lot because even if not something romantic, if you share that much time and moments with somebody, you'll at least treat them like basic human beings and can at least try to be friendly rather than disappearing completely. That made me feel so fucked up for the longest time. Because I used to ask him for his favorite food, get ingredients, spend a lot of time cooking, would dress up well, and other small things for him.

I have a lot of self-respect, so after that line of his, ""all good things must end,"" it was very clear to me that I don't have to bother him one bit. I've already done enough for him. NOW, it's been a full four years, but I still have that super fresh in my memory. It just doesn't go away. The chilly weather, at times snowfall or rains, all the moments spent, bonfire, cooking, laughter, and the incredible physical intimacy, just how good he was in bed. Now it's more about the hurt. I really wish that I don't remember him as much as I still do and already forget about him. Want to make it clear I don't miss him in any romantic way like I want him or anything because a person who can switch off like that has to be a sociopath. So romantic feelings went away long back. But because of the feeling of being so dumb to get used like that doesn't go away. That was introduction to modern dating f*uckery. Since then I have guarded my heart well but this one thing that happened long back, I really want to forget and forgive myself for it. ",1,1739181520.0,delhi,0,0.67,False

I had been so busy (as main breadwinner as both parents are unwell, in different ways) and had originally planned this for Christmas last year (we had a quiet one instead) and I wanted to finally take him to a relatively ""affordable"" omakase with my new job's pay - so I thought I'd wait until his birthday. He's also mentioned before he wanted to go (not directly, just admiring when someone else he knew went) so I knew he would have really loved it.

Unfortunately, he passed today.

I feel so anguished that I didn't take him - I had promised him because I knew we would probably never get to visit Japan which he really wanted to go to. He was hospitalised a few weeks ago for a fever but instead of getting better, he got worse - and then he declined very rapidly. 

If a loved one's health is getting worse - don't postpone your plans. Seize the day and do it earlier - you never know. You really never know. 

I feel like the regret will eat away at me forever. I couldn't get him to Japan, and I couldn't even compensate with a meal. A big ""fancy"" meal is different to coffee or drinks or snacks or whatever, and I told him as he passed that if there's a next life that I'll treat him to it.

While he was leaving, he said that he'll call me once he reaches the other place and send me pictures and videos from there because that place was on my bucket list too, but as soon as he left, he just disappeared. Never any call, never anything. It hurt a lot because even if not something romantic, if you share that much time and moments with somebody, you'll at least treat them like basic human beings and can at least try to be friendly rather than disappearing completely. That made me feel so fucked up for the longest time. Because I used to ask him for his favorite food, get ingredients, spend a lot of time cooking, would dress up well, and other small things for him.

I have a lot of self-respect, so after that line of his, ""all good things must end,"" it was very clear to me that I don't have to bother him one bit. I've already done enough for him. NOW, it's been a full four years, but I still have that super fresh in my memory. It just doesn't go away. The chilly weather, at times snowfall or rains, all the moments spent, bonfire, cooking, laughter, and the incredible physical intimacy, just how good he was in bed. Now it's more about the hurt. I really wish that I don't remember him as much as I still do and already forget about him. Want to make it clear I don't miss him in any romantic way like I want him or anything because a person who can switch off like that has to be a sociopath. So romantic feelings went away long back. But because of the feeling of being so dumb to get used like that doesn't go away. That was introduction to modern dating f*uckery. Since then I have guarded my heart well but this one thing that happened long back, I really want to forget and forgive myself for it. 

TLDR - I had a 5 week thing with a man I met during a vacation in a mountain town. I believed our connection was meaningful, but he left saying, ""All good things must end,"" and then disappeared without contact. Four years later, I still feel hurt and used, struggling to move past the experience. ",3,1739181062.0,RelationshipIndia,7,1.0,False

To preface, I genuinely like my university and would love to stay all four years, but my current living situation is making that very difficult.

I attend a CSU in California but wasn’t able to get a dorm, and finding an affordable rental nearby has been nearly impossible. Thankfully, my sister-in-law’s (24F) grandmother offered me a place to stay. I live with my sister-in-law, her older brother (25M), and her grandparents. The arrangement seemed ideal—a couple hundred dollars in rent and a small fee for gas, since I don’t have a car or a driver’s license.

At first, everything seemed fine. But around my second month there, my sister-in-law’s older brother confessed that he had feelings for me. I made it clear that I didn’t feel the same way, but since then, he’s been love-bombing me—constantly giving me gifts, buying me treats, offering to pay for things, and making excessive comments about how he’s “such a catch.” Despite my consistent requests to stop, he continues to act this way. While these gestures may not seem malicious, they always come with an expectation. He frequently jokes that I don’t do nice things for him or compliment his outfits, and claims he’s probably the only guy who’s “ever been this good to me.” It makes me uncomfortable and guilted, as though I owe him something for his behavior—even though I never asked for any of it.

I’ve tried addressing this, but nothing has changed. Each time I bring it up, he seems offended or hurt. My sister-in-law is very busy with her major, so she’s rarely home. Meanwhile, I rely on her brother to drive me to class. He’s not in school yet, so he’s been with me constantly for the past few weeks, even waiting for me after each class. I haven’t been able to form any social life, as he discourages me from making friends, saying things like “Meeting people isn’t important right now.” If I try to grab coffee with a classmate, he gets upset. When I wanted to join a club, he told me it would be a “waste of time” when I could be studying. He also tells me he’ll “only let me” go out with friends if I have good grades. The thing is, I’m a good student—I stay on top of my work and genuinely enjoy learning. But ever since I moved for college, I’ve felt completely suffocated.

It feels like he’s micromanaging me, and it’s emotionally draining. He treats me like a child who needs constant supervision. I try to convince myself it’s coming from a good place, but it always feels controlling and obsessive. I was initially so shocked by his behavior that I stayed quiet, not fully processing what was happening.

His actions have only grown more unsettling. For example, he takes my jackets and hangs them in his room because they “smell like me,” or keeps my scrunchies on his wrist or in the car. Recently, I reached for a scrunchie in the car, and he quickly grabbed it, refusing to give it to me despite me needing it for class. When I tried to take it, he joked about me not being allowed to have it, and got upset when I insisted. It wasn’t funny, and it made me uncomfortable. He gets irritated if I question any of his behavior, and it’s creating a pattern that makes me feel more and more uneasy.

Overall, his demeanor is overly affectionate and clingy, and my trust in him has greatly diminished. We’ve had many discussions where it seems like he understands, but then he falls back into his old habits. Honestly, I don’t have the patience to keep dealing with this on top of my studies—I’m a STEM major, and I need focus and peace of mind.

The biggest issue is that I rely on FAFSA for financial aid, and my parents can’t afford to help me. I’m stuck in a situation where I can’t afford to move out or transfer easily. On top of that, if I do transfer, I would need to buy a car. Coming from a Latino family, I know my parents would be upset with me for “causing problems” when I have a “perfect” living arrangement.

I just feel suffocated and oppressed, which is something I’ve dealt with in high school due to my strict Latino parents. I want more for myself than this, but I’m scared to make a move because of the financial implications.

I apologize if this is all over the place—it’s just been weighing on me for a while. I’d appreciate any advice or suggestions. At this point, transferring feels like my only way out. I can’t live like this anymore. What should I do?",1,1739181014.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I was in my early 20s, young and naive, totally unaware of modern dating, its perils, or f*kboys. I was living in a small, stunning, and peaceful mountain town on a long solo vacation. I met this man who was also solo tripping in the same town. He was tall, good-looking, had a good job n our hobbies n intellect matched. Loneliness was catching up to me because the place was secluded, and there weren't many tourists, maybe this had a part to play.

So, this guy and I started hanging out on a weekly basis and spent the weekends together since both of us were working and were busy during weekdays. We used to go for coffee/food, take long walks in the forest, sometimes go on bike rides to nearby villages, and also got physically intimate. That was the best s*x of my life, also because the guy said that he was fairly experienced and he was a real giver in bed. I'd cook a lot too for him because he really liked food made by me. He'd tell me his life stories.

So, all in all, serene gorgeous mountain town, good-looking lad pleasuring me in so many ways, and I was completely oblivious to the feelings I was developing yet. I never thought it was necessary to ""discuss"" things because, as I said, from where I was coming, it's implied that if you are doing such stuff together, it's romantic. I didn't know, as per modern dating, you need to have a discussion to label it as ""exclusive."" I thought since both of us are equally in this and s*x has also happened, so obviously, it's not just strangers anymore.

This continued for straight five weeks until it was time for him to leave. The last week we were together, my feelings finally hit me. I was really overwhelmed by my feelings, didn't want him to leave, and I was hoping he at least felt 10% of what I do because how come both of us shared every moment together, but it's only me ending up with all the feelings.

The moment came when he was leaving, and I was crying inconsolably nonstop. And his eyes were blank or maybe confused about where this is coming from. I felt so embarrassed in that moment because I could see he feels nothing. I felt such a fool right there and then n realized what I have done to myself. Finally, when I stopped crying, I tried to tell him about my feelings. He shushed me even before I could say everything and just said, ""All good things must end."" That hurt like a grenade. In that moment, I realized how damn one-sided it is, and I was nothing more than a vacation f*k for him.

1im2c00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1im2c00/what_makes_a_good_logo_design/,What Makes a Good Logo Design?,"# Is Your Logo Working Hard Enough? The Hallmarks of a Good Logo Design.

Let's face it: a logo is often the first thing people see when they encounter your brand. It's your visual handshake, your silent salesperson, and your brand's most recognizable ambassador. But is your logo doing its job? Is it truly representing your business in the best possible light? A forgettable, poorly designed logo can actually hurt your brand, creating a negative or confusing first impression. On the other hand, a [good logo design](https://weandthecolor.com/what-makes-good-logo-design-secrets-iconic-branding/196196) can elevate your brand, build trust, and attract customers like a magnet.

Why is a **good logo design** so crucial? Because in today's visually saturated world, attention spans are shorter than ever. You have mere seconds to grab someone's attention and make a lasting impact. A well-crafted logo instantly communicates your brand's values, personality, and what sets you apart from the competition. It's the foundation upon which your entire brand identity is built.

Think about the brands you admire. Chances are, their logos are instantly recognizable, even without the brand name present. That's the power of a **good logo design** at work! It's not just about aesthetics; it's about strategic communication and building a strong brand presence.

So, what are the essential elements that separate a truly **good logo design** from the rest? Let's explore the critical features that every designer and business owner should understand. Get ready to learn what it takes to create a logo that not only looks great but also drives results.

# Simplicity Rules: Crafting a Clean and Impactful Logo

Imagine trying to explain a complex, cluttered image to someone who only glances at it for a second. Impossible, right? That's why simplicity is paramount in **good logo design**. A clean, uncomplicated logo is easier to understand, remember, and reproduce.

Think of the most iconic logos: the Target bullseye, the Twitter bird, the Google logo. They're all incredibly simple, yet instantly recognizable. How do you achieve this simplicity?

* **Focus on one key message:** What's the single, most important thing you want your logo to communicate?
* **Eliminate unnecessary elements:** Get rid of anything that doesn't directly support the core message.
* **Embrace negative space:** Use empty space to create visual interest and improve readability.

A simplified logo ensures your message is clear and impactful, even at a glance. A **good logo design** is one that makes you wonder ""Why didn't I think of that?!""

# Memorability Matters: Making a Logo That Sticks

What's the point of a logo if no one remembers it? A memorable logo is easily recalled and instantly associated with your brand. It's the key to building brand recognition and customer loyalty.

But how do you create a logo that sticks in people's minds?

* **Uniqueness is key:** Avoid generic imagery and clichés. Strive for originality.
* **Visual Association:** Connect your logo to your brand name, industry, or core values.
* **Consistent branding:** Use your logo consistently across all platforms to reinforce recognition.

Think about the last time you saw a logo that truly grabbed your attention. What made it so memorable? A **good logo design** creates a lasting impression.

# Versatility is Vital: A Logo That Works Everywhere

Your logo isn't just going to live on your website. It needs to look great on business cards, social media profiles, merchandise, and everything in between. That's why versatility is so important.

* **Scalability is essential:** Ensure your logo looks sharp and clear at any size, from small icons to large banners.
* **Color Flexibility:** Design your logo to work well in both color and black and white versions.
* **Adaptability to surfaces:** Think about how your logo will look on different materials and backgrounds.

Imagine your logo being embroidered on a polo shirt or printed on a coffee mug. Would it still look good? A **good logo design** will.

# Timeless Appeal: Avoiding the Trend Trap

Trends come and go, but a truly **good logo design** is timeless. It remains relevant and effective for years, even decades, to come. How do you create a logo that stands the test of time?

* **Steer clear of fleeting trends:** Avoid trendy fonts, colors, and design styles that will quickly look dated.
* **Focus on fundamental principles:** Emphasize simplicity, clarity, and memorability.
* **Draw inspiration from classic designs:** Study timeless logos for guidance.

A timeless logo transcends the latest fads and creates a lasting visual identity for your brand.

# Appropriateness is Key: Speaking to Your Audience

A **good logo design** resonates with your target audience. It reflects your brand's personality and values in a way that appeals to your ideal customer.

* **Know your audience:** Who are you trying to reach with your logo?
* **Understand industry conventions:** What are the standard visual cues in your industry?
* **Define your brand's personality:** Is your brand playful, serious, luxurious, or eco-friendly?

A logo for a high-end spa will likely look very different from a logo for a construction company. A **good logo design** speaks directly to your target audience.

# The Power of Color Psychology

Colors evoke emotions and associations. Choosing the right colors for your logo can significantly impact how your brand is perceived.

* **Red:** Excitement, energy, passion, urgency
* **Blue:** Trust, stability, calm, professionalism
* **Green:** Nature, growth, health, sustainability
* **Yellow:** Optimism, happiness, creativity, warning

Consider the psychological effects of different colors when making your color choices.

# Typography: Choosing the Right Font

The font you use in your logo conveys personality and tone. It's crucial to choose a font that aligns with your brand's identity and is easy to read.

* **Serif fonts:** Traditional, formal, trustworthy, reliable
* **Sans-serif fonts:** Modern, clean, approachable, minimalist
* **Script fonts:** Elegant, feminine, creative, personal

Use only one or two fonts for a clean, cohesive look. A **good logo design** makes font choice a core component of the design process.

# Utilize Negative Space Effectively

The empty space around and within your logo can be a powerful design element. Negative space can:

* **Create visual interest:** Add depth and sophistication.
* **Improve readability:** Make the logo easier to understand.
* **Convey a hidden message:** Add a subtle layer of meaning.

Look at the Toblerone logo. The bear hidden within the mountain is a clever use of negative space that adds a touch of Swiss heritage to the design.

# Seeking Feedback and Refining

Logo design is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback and make revisions.

* **Gather diverse perspectives:** Share your logo with people from different backgrounds and industries.
* **Embrace constructive criticism:** View feedback as an opportunity to improve.
* **Refine and iterate:** Make adjustments based on the feedback you receive.

The more feedback you get, the stronger your logo will become. A **good logo design** is constantly being tested and refined.

# Protecting Your Brand: Trademarking

Once you've finalized your logo, protect your brand by trademarking it.

* **Conduct a trademark search:** Ensure your logo isn't already in use.
* **File a trademark application:** Protect your brand identity legally.
* **Monitor for infringement:** Vigilantly protect your trademark rights.

Trademarking prevents others from using your logo and helps build a stronger brand identity.

# In Summary: Investing in a Good Logo Design

A **good logo design** is an investment in your brand's future. It's a crucial element of your overall marketing strategy and can significantly impact your business's success. By prioritizing simplicity, memorability, versatility, timelessness, and appropriateness, you can create a logo that not only looks great but also drives results. Hire a designer who prioritizes creating a **good logo design** and your company will prosper.

Remember to carefully consider your target audience, brand personality, and industry when designing your logo. Use color and typography strategically to communicate your brand's message. Seek feedback, iterate on your design, and protect your brand by trademarking your logo. It's the only way to make sure your logo represents a **good logo design**.

# They were having a great time!

The biggest advantage they have is that they can easily scan the barcode of any food, input the data into a fitness app, and create their diet plan. In India, it’s not that simple.

Here is a complete [7-day Keto diet plan](https://www.ketoforindia.com/indian-keto-diet-plan/), and meal prep tips to set you up for weight loss success. 

# Day 1: Monday

☕ Breakfast

Bulletproof CoffeeOmelette with Butter and Bacon

# Directions & Ingredients

||
||
|Step: 1|Whisk 2 eggs together|
|Step: 2|Add salt and pepper|
|Step: 3|Fry in 2 teaspoons of butter|
|Step: 4|Add 2 Bacon (Pan-fried)|

Add one fresh cream in whisked eggs then pour into a hot non-stick skillet. Once it is cooked to a fine golden color on one side. Let it cook some more and take it off the pan.  


🥗 Lunch

Mutton Seekh Kebab

Mutton Seekh Kebab

Because I work six days a week, my lunches must be portable and at room temperature. My freezer is always filled with ready-made mutton, chicken seekh kebab, and bacon.

Directions  


I just took one seekh kebab out of the packet after thawing it.

1. In a non-stick pan, I shallow fry it in ghee.
2. Then I cut it into small roundels and pack it in a small Tupperware container.
3. You can sprinkle some chaat masala on it. Make sure to read the label because different firms have different breakups.

For emergencies and days when you don’t have time to prepare meals. Try your best to eat fresh food if that’s the case.

Blanched Broccoli with Salt and Pepper



Broccoli comes in very handy in Keto. It is a versatile ingredient that can be incorporated into all three meals. I always keep some blanched and ready in my fridge.

🍟 Evening snacks 

Milk is rich in lactose and carbs. Avoid it on a Keto diet. Cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt are all fine in moderation, but you should keep a careful eye on if they make you leave ketosis. In the evening I have a handful of peanuts. Somedays, I replace the peanuts with 6 almonds and 4 halves of walnuts.

🥘 Dinner

Omelette

Try Keto spinach egg omelet for the dinner. It is healthier than non-keto things and tastes better. When time is of the essence, the recipe is the favored choice because it requires less preparation.

Day 2: Tuesday

☕ Breakfast

Bulletproof Coffee

Start a day with Bulletproof Coffee, but you can switch it with green tea or any beverage.

Hard-boiled eggs with Mutton Seekh Kebab



Mutton Seekh Kebab

Mutton Seekh Kebab

You can have a single kebab and 3 eggs or change it according to your taste. Choose your portion. In a non-stick pan. I shallow fry it in ghee. I suggest having the eggs with homemade mayo or mint chutney.

Mint Chutney with green chillies

# Ingredients

||
||
|Mint leaves (washed and chopped)|250 grams|
|Coriander or cilantro leaves (washed and chopped)|100 grams|
|Lemon juice|of 2-3 lemons|
|Red onion (sliced)|1 medium|
|Green chilies (roughly chopped)|4-5|
|Pink and white salt|As per your taste|
|Red chilly powder|As per your taste|
|Stevia (optional)|A few drops|

Procedure

Blend all ingredients until they form a fine paste. Some Indian women add a spoonful of sugar to the dish. This chutney should be stored in an airtight container for a week.

Recipe for homemade Mayo



🥗 Lunch

Shallow Fried Cottage Cheese



This is one of my favorite meals. It’s delicious hot or cold. For this, you need 100 gms of cottage cheese.

# Ingredients

||
||
|Cottage cheese|100 grams|
|Turmeric powder|½ tbsp|
|Chilly powder|½ tbsp|
|Coriander powder|½ tbsp|
|Salt|1 tbsp|
|Chaat Masala (optional)|½ tbsp|
|Mango powder (dried)|½ tbsp|

Directions

1. Make a thick paste of all these dry masalas, with water or oil.
2. Fork the cottage cheese from all sides.
3. Now apply this paste on all sides and let the cottage cheese rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Heat a griddle, add some ghee, and fry this piece of cheese by turning it on all sides.
5. After you are done frying, let it cool down, and now cut it into small cubes. Some days I also fry a few juliennes of green peppers or capsicum on the same pan and add to the dish.
6. The chat masala can also be sprinkled in the end, along with a few drops of fresh lime juice. Chat masala is a mixture of pungent dry spices, often used in Indian cooking to sprinkle over tikkas, and other fried stuff.

🍟 Snacks

After a long day at work, we all look forward to a small snack at home. You can choose to have some chopped strawberries some almonds or peanuts. Or just grab a glass of salted and chilled buttermilk. Whatever you have ensured that it is within your macros.

Half a cup of cut Strawberries



Buttermilk/Lassi (250 ml)

>

🥘 Dinner

Shredded Chicken Breast in Soya Sauce

This an easy recipe, that can be cooked in a jiffy and has very little prep time.

Ingredients

2. Add soya sauce, black pepper, and if you want a few chilly flakes.
3. Heat a few cloves of garlic until tossed pink.
4. Now add the chicken and cook on high heat. The chicken will be ready in no time and it tastes delicious.

☕ Breakfast

Peanuts Oil Roasted and Salted

roasted nuts

Procedure

For those of you who have never tried peanuts Indian style, I plead you to grab a packet (30 gms) from the closest Indian store. Believe me,  you will get hooked on them. Some Ketoites are not snacking at all, and I must say that’s commendable. At the end of the day, Indians typically have a cup of tea and a meal with their parents, kids, or friends.

Chicken Seekh Kebab



Since I started sharing my journey, I have had many requests to share my recipe for Chicken Seekh kebabs. So here goes:

Ingredients

||
||
|Chicken mince, preferably with fat|500 gram|
|Green chilies chopped|2-3 pieces|
|Chopped Coriander leaves|½ cup|
|Ginger Garlic Paste|2 tsp|
|Roasted cumin powder|1 tsp|
|Garam Masala|1 tsp|
|Kashmiri or Deghi Red chilly powder|½ tsp|
|Melted Butter or Ghee for basting|1 tsp|
|Lemon Juice|1 tsp|
|Chaat Masala|½ tsp (optional)|
|Salt|As per taste preference|

Directions

1. In the food processor grind together the mince, green chili, and fresh coriander. Ensure that the consistency is very fine.
2. Now add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
3. Divide the mixture into equal proportions.
4. Pat the mixture and form patties or with moist hands give it the shape of kebabs over skewers. The important thing to remember is that the mixture should not be overly moist or very dry, it should be of workable consistency. If you feel that the mixture is getting out of hand or not sticking to the skewer, beat an egg and add to it.
5. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and cook the kebabs in it for 15 to 20 minutes. You can also barbeque them, but remember to baste them with butter or ghee at least 2 to 3 times.

Enjoy them hot and remember to sprinkle some lemon juice and chaat masala over them.

Shami Kebab

For your Indian take on the Keto diet, I’m going to give you another recipe for a well-known kebab. This one promises to melt in your mouth. It is called the Shami Kebab.  It is made with minced lamb and can be made in batches and stored in the fridge. The preparation time is just 30 minutes, and cooking takes almost 20 minutes or less.

# Ingredients

||
||
|Minced mutton (without fat)|500 grams|
|Soaked split Bengal gram|2 tablespoons|
|Psyllium husk powder|1 tablespoon|
|Ginger and garlic paste|2 tablespoons|
|Garam masala|1 tablespoon|
|Green cardamom|2 pieces|
|Cinnamon|1 stick or 1 tablespoon cinnamon powder|
|Fresh coriander|half cup (chopped)|
|Chopped mint leaves|a handful|
|Egg|1 beaten|
|Lemon juice|½ tbsp|
|Ghee (for frying)|As per preference|
|Salt|As per preference|

# Procedure

1. To the washed and drained mince add the Bengal gram. Although, I am just using 2 tbsp for 12 kebabs.
2. Add the ginger, garlic, and all the other increments except the herbs.
3. Now let it cool off.
4. Add the herbs to this paste and give it the form of dough.
5. You can beat the egg and add it to the dough. Or you can make small balls, flatten them out like a kebab, and dip them in the egg before frying. If you ask me I prefer to mix the egg in the dough and form the kebabs. That way the smell of the egg is not so dominant. You can also skip the onion if you want. You can either shallow fry them in ghee or deep fry them. Serve them hot with green chutney and a green salad.

Chicken Broth

# Procedure and Ingredients

My broth recipe is very simple I get chicken necks from my butcher. Put them in a pressure cooker with a few cloves of garlic, a piece of ginger, and a small chopped onion. With a generous amount of water, I let them cook for almost 45 minutes on low heat, allowing all the juices to come out. Later I shred the chicken and strain the broth. Add salt and pepper.

Scrambled Eggs

Beat three eggs to a fluffy stage with salt and pepper. I like to have them with crispy fried bacon, but that’s entirely your choice. Add some ghee to a pan and pour in the egg mixture. Sprinkle in some oregano, and chilly flakes. My twist on these eggs is to add a dash of Sriracha and make them hot and mouth-watering. I like to wash down my spicy eggs with my absolute favorite mug of Bulletproof coffee with butter and coconut oil.

🥗 Lunch

Capsicum/Peppers stuffed with Cottage Cheese (Paneer)

Capsicum stuffed with Cottage Cheese

Capsicum and Broccoli in moderation have become my favorite veggies on the Keto diet. For this recipe, you will need medium-sized capsicums that have space for filling. You can go for any color of capsicum.

|Cottage Cheese (grated)|½ to 1 cup|
|Chopped onions (optional)|½ cup|

1. Completely deseed the capsicums and cut out their tops.
2. Add the cottage cheese, onions, lemon juice, cumin powder, turmeric salt, and red chili powder. Mix well and add ½ tsp of olive oil and mix more.
3. Stuff the capsicums with this cheese stuffing.
4. Cover the capsicums with foil or attach the tops with a toothpick.
5. Preheat the oven and set the mode to the oven and grill.
6. Grill properly until the skin of the capsicum looks all shriveled up. I like to apply some olive oil to the capsicums on the outside too, to enhance the grilling process.

Cauliflower Rice



I have seen numerous recipes for Cauliflower fried rice on the Internet. This is my version of it.

Procedure

1. Cut the florets of cauliflower and put them in a food processor. You can also use a hand garter.

3. In a wok add some ghee, a few cloves of garlic, and fry till golden.
4. Now add the cauliflower, salt, pepper, and a pinch of chilly flakes.
5. Cook some more, but prevent the rice from looking like a mash. You can also add some freshly chopped cilantro or coriander at the end. Your Keto-friendly fried rice is ready.

Tandoori Chicken

I (31f) was with my ex (26m) for 2.5 years, he broke up with me in August and came back immediately, we went to couples therapy, he broke up with me again in November. I left the apartment the day after and went no contact. We spoke in December when a new tenant entered our apartment and there were some issues. The conversation was not pleasant and I think his feelings were hurt because I was no longer being his loving and understanding girlfriend. I called him out for handling the situation with the apartment badly and not stepping up. I also told him I’m moving back to the US and he seemed shocked. 

I am leaving the country (I’ve lived abroad for 8 years) to relocate back to the US this week. In the past month I’ve really missed our friendship and I reached out to open the door to being friends in the future, he said he wasn’t ready which I understand. He also sent me a happy birthday text in January.

Anyway, I reached out last week to say I wanted to meet before I go; I understand that he still needs time but I just didn’t want our last conversation and meeting to be so negative. He said he wanted to think about it and then he agreed to meet on Saturday. When I asked where he wanted to meet (assuming we would sit for a coffee or tea) he just said a street where there’s a lot of benches. I should have known then that he didn’t intend the conversation to be long. 

I met him and he smiled at me like a robot and barely said anything. He was being so fake and not vulnerable at all, just a wall with a forced smile. He asked me what I wanted to say and I just said I wanted us to have a goodbye that reflected our relationship overall, which was positive. I asked if he had anything to say and he said no that he’s made “peace” with everything. I told him that I felt like he was talking to me like a stranger and he said he wasn’t. I kind of shut down when I realized he didn’t really want to talk and told him he could go. The whole interaction was 7 minutes long. 

I didn’t expect it to be pleasant, but I expected some level of vulnerability and conversation. I texted him after to say I felt like he had already blocked out our relationship and all the love we had and he said “I’m sorry you feel that way” and that he “made a big effort” to see me. 7 minutes? I don’t think he is actually indifferent, he just doesn’t want to confront the hard feelings. 

I know there will be some lesson in this and it was unfair of me to have expectations, but right now I’m spiraling. I was doing really well before, but now I feel like a fool. Where did all that love go? 

My therapist says that I should feel good, I gave our relationship a real chance and gave us a chance at a compassionate end, and in both cases he was unable to deal with his complex emotions.

Please help.,"TLDR - I had a 5 week thing with a man I met during a vacation in a mountain town. I believed our connection was meaningful, but he left saying, ""All good things must end,"" and then disappeared without contact. Four years later, I still feel hurt and used, struggling to move past the experience. 

I'm embarrassed that I even have to make a post about this.
I was in my early 20s, young and naive, totally unaware of modern dating, its perils, or f*kboys. I was living in a small, stunning, and peaceful mountain town on a long solo vacation. I met this man who was also solo tripping in the same town. He was tall, good-looking, had a good job n our hobbies n intellect matched. Loneliness was catching up to me because the place was secluded, and there weren't many tourists, maybe this had a part to play.

So, this guy and I started hanging out on a weekly basis and spent the weekends together since both of us were working and were busy during weekdays. We used to go for coffee/food, take long walks in the forest, sometimes go on bike rides to nearby villages, and also got physically intimate. That was the best s*x of my life, also because the guy said that he was fairly experienced and he was a real giver in bed. I'd cook a lot too for him because he really liked food made by me. He'd tell me his life stories.

So, all in all, serene gorgeous mountain town, good-looking lad pleasuring me in so many ways, and I was completely oblivious to the feelings I was developing yet. I never thought it was necessary to ""discuss"" things because, as I said, from where I was coming, it's implied that if you are doing such stuff together, it's romantic. I didn't know, as per modern dating, you need to have a discussion to label it as ""exclusive."" I thought since both of us are equally in this and s*x has also happened, so obviously, it's not just strangers anymore.

This continued for straight five weeks until it was time for him to leave. The last week we were together, my feelings finally hit me. I was really overwhelmed by my feelings, didn't want him to leave, and I was hoping he at least felt 10% of what I do because how come both of us shared every moment together, but it's only me ending up with all the feelings.

The moment came when he was leaving, and I was crying inconsolably nonstop. And his eyes were blank or maybe confused about where this is coming from. I felt so embarrassed in that moment because I could see he feels nothing. I felt such a fool right there and then n realized what I have done to myself. Finally, when I stopped crying, I tried to tell him about my feelings. He shushed me even before I could say everything and just said, ""All good things must end."" That hurt like a grenade. In that moment, I realized how damn one-sided it is, and I was nothing more than a vacation f*k for him.

While he was leaving, he said that he'll call me once he reaches the other place and send me pictures and videos from there because that place was on my bucket list too, but as soon as he left, he just disappeared. Never any call, never anything. It hurt a lot because even if not something romantic, if you share that much time and moments with somebody, you'll at least treat them like basic human beings and can at least try to be friendly rather than disappearing completely. That made me feel so fucked up for the longest time. Because I used to ask him for his favorite food, get ingredients, spend a lot of time cooking, would dress up well, and other small things for him.

I have a lot of self-respect, so after that line of his, ""all good things must end,"" it was very clear to me that I don't have to bother him one bit. I've already done enough for him. NOW, it's been a full four years, but I still have that super fresh in my memory. It just doesn't go away. The chilly weather, at times snowfall or rains, all the moments spent, bonfire, cooking, laughter, and the incredible physical intimacy, just how good he was in bed. Now it's more about the hurt. I really wish that I don't remember him as much as I still do and already forget about him. Want to make it clear I don't miss him in any romantic way like I want him or anything because a person who can switch off like that has to be a sociopath. So romantic feelings went away long back. But because of the feeling of being so dumb to get used like that doesn't go away. That was introduction to modern dating f*uckery. Since then I have guarded my heart well but this one thing that happened long back, I really want to forget and forgive myself for it. ",11,1739177314.0,AskIndianWomen,13,0.92,False
1im1pvk,https://i.redd.it/cfmxihdwy9ie1.jpeg,Is this normal in Haitian culture or just my household,"In my household my mom uses about 3/4’s of the kitchen counter top for decoration. She also uses almost all the kitchen top cabinets for decoration except for one she uses for spices. I can think of no good reason to do this. Whenever I go to other Haitian houses the counters are usually filled with kitchen appliances but my mom thinks they make the kitchen counter ugly. Other houses usually store extra food in their top kitchen cabinets but mines place them in the garage with the top cabinet instead being filled with dishes. She also hoards a lot of used items for example one of the things she uses to decorate our counter top is a used coffee machine, which I think she got for free. The problem is the coffee machine is a hiding ground for roaches. The dishes we use regularly are all either stored in the dishwasher, or confined to one bottom cabinet, and the garage. Often times when I have a dish I use regularly I often find them stashed away in the garage and in place of where it was a brand new floral plastic food container. Living in my mom’s house has been hell. Also a bit of a rant some of the places used to store food are dirty or just unsafe. For example in my garage my parents want to build a kitchen for cooking even though it’s against our HOA, meaning we could loose a lot of money through fines. My parents have started to build a kitchen and at first it was meant as a place to cook foods with heavy flavors. But instead they use it as a place to store our snacks, healthy foods, and meat which often become brittle or un edible due to the garages unpredictable temperature changes. She stores all the left overs in the fridge inside because they fruits, vegetables, and fresh meats would make the fridge inside look ugly. Not to mention my parents use the garage as a front door and often leave it open so when ever you want to cook something you have to do it in front of the views of the whole neighbors, plus the large roaches, the lizards, and what ever else lies in the garage. Our garage is also very cluttered and filled with wood that attracts a lot of pests. Also I believe there is a religious aspect to this whenever we confront my mom, she always quotes pastors on how mother should have all the say in how a house should be decorated. Not the Bible but pastors. ",6,1739177254.0,haiti,0,1.0,False

“I think we can, C.""

“Let’s set down.""

The clearing was more than large enough even for the forge. Clorinda spotted it as they emerged from the trees and sighed with relief. She could finally stop. Vix set them down in the meadow, gently pressing the grass and flowers flat. Its four propellers slowed to a stop as the forge settled into the dense vegetation. Clorinda lifted her cockpit door and swung herself outside. She spread her arms wide, stretching out her fingers to feel the air flowing gently between them. She took a moment to enjoy the heat of the sun on her neck and face. She laid down and let the grass scratch and tickle her upper back. This was her first time in nature since childhood. She removed her left arm, rubbing her shoulder at the join. She wanted not to feel the metal. She wanted grass and earth and the warmth of the sun.

Vix fanned out the forge's panels and drank in the sunlight.

“You ok?” asked Clorinda.

“Perfect”, replied Vix. “I’ll be charged for flight within the hour, or for forge-work in two.”

“Oh, there’s no hurry Vix”, Clorinda said. “This could be the perfect campsite.”

“C, you’ve seen the footage. It’s not safe out here in the woods.”

“Vix, look around you. Where’s the danger?”

“I expect it will arrive by night.”

“Come on, V, they’re lying! Lying to keep us in! This could be paradise. This *is* paradise! Look at these flowers! Smell them!”

A blue, holographic chessboard bubbled up from the centre of her metallic left palm.

“Knight C6”.

“Oh, are we still playing? Bishop B5. I’ll be alright if the wolves come. Or the bears. Or even the cannibals; I suspect they only want organic matter. It’s you I’m worried about”.

“Vix, I will take my chances. I’m done with Nottingham. I can’t spend another day behind that wall. You’ve known that for longer than I have. A6”.

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Bishop A4. Are you concerned about reprisals?”.

“Knight F6. Reprisals? I’m on leave. I have months of privacy privilege and we’re well out of range. That gives me a while to plan, to think...”

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Have you considered food and water? I have only thirty days' reserves. Castle”.

“Think bigger, Vix. You have more than supplies in there, you have tools. We can use what’s around us. Make it work.”

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Remember though that your friends will be worried. You don’t want to lose contact do you?”

Clorinda bit her lip. She often wondered whether Vix meant to nag (or whether AI could mean anything at all). She could feel her stress rising. She tried to focus on the feel of the grass and the sight of the sky. But she knew that what she’d done was reckless. Other than getting up and over the city wall, getting clear, she had no plan.

“Just…Bishop E7”.

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Rook E1”.

“Pause.”

Clorinda breathed deeply. ‘Friends don’t pause friends’, she rebuked herself. She ran her right, organic hand along Vix’s deep purple shell. She remembered spray painting it that colour when she was nine. Her father reading behind her, their collie Bub stretched out on the lawn. Having beaten Dad at chess, she won the bet and was rewarded with the right to paint the family solar-forge. She chose the colour.

It became a trademark. Clorinda’s parents ran a ramshackle operation, turning scrap into valuable, usable tools. The forge was an old design even then, but it worked well, focusing the sun’s rays into intense heat to make metal and plastic malleable. The work fascinated Clorinda. She would spend hours with her mother, melting, hammering, soldering, sculpting. She was proud of their creations. They weren’t rich by any means, but the waste-smithy paid well enough to send the gifted Clorinda to a private school. There, she learned advanced mathematics, chemistry, biology. And then university in the far north. By day, she learned the principles of solar, wave and wind. By night, underground lectures in apartments and dingy classrooms introduced her to politics. But when the university was bought by Gisbourne, all of that stopped. Clorinda headed home to Nottingham, aged 21, for a prestigious job as an engineer.

She took the forge with her all that time, with its shuttle as her main mode of transportation. Again, it became a sort of trademark. Her peers couldn’t understand it. An ugly, home-painted shuttle with a dated AI assistant, attached to a lumbering old solar-forge? Why not something new? But this was only one of the many eccentricities Clorinda’s genius afforded her. Her employer, the Gisbourne Organisation, was a notoriously strict regime. Not just anyone could keep their own personal vehicle, let alone an entire forge. This privilege stemmed from Clorinda’s status as the pre-eminent engineer and waste-smith on the Isles. No other Nottingham subject could take off for so much as a week, let alone months, without contact. No other subject was granted such a generous privacy privilege. The company did not want to lose her.

And yet, lose her they had. Clorinda did not know what she would do, but she knew what she would not. She would not return. She would not give Gisbourne another moment of her time and labour.

She watched the sunlight twinkle on Vix’s panels.

“Turn on. B5”.

\*

It was morning in the clearing. Clorinda had slept in the cockpit, curled awkwardly behind her steering wheel.

Vix woke her at 0600 with soft light and an ersatz coffee aroma. Clorinda stumbled out into the body of the forge.

It was cavernous. Five chambers emerged from a central hangar. The first was the living space, designed for a single waste-smith to live in relative comfort. A fold-down bed, a basic kitchen and a spartan bathroom were all that it offered, but all, Clorinda supposed, that she needed. She walked into the bathroom and showered, her head bowed to avoid mirrors.

The second chamber was a toolshed. It housed the family’s equipment that dated back generations. Some hammers and spanners even bore the early 21st century family firm’s name - ‘Gray Toolmakers Ltd’. Those with the name-stamp were preserved and displayed, never used.

The third chamber was Vix’s domain. At the centre of the room stood a vast 3D printer, topped by scanners and cameras. Vix could print and reprint any design Clorinda prototyped. Her only limitation was the amount of raw material she could harvest from the North Sea waste islands. That material, mostly plastic and metal, was stored in the fourth chamber. It was topped by a vast, thick glass dome that focused the sun’s rays, melting down the scrap and readying it for the printer. The first of its kind, the solar-forge was designed by Clorinda’s mothers and remained a popular technology for those who preferred to lead lives of self-sufficiency outside the walled cities.

The fifth and final chamber was the one that worried Clorinda: even with her privileges, its contents could cause her serious trouble. The chamber was filled with prototypes for Gisbourne Security. Every tool here was designed for espionage and the suppression of dissidence. Chemicals were stored on one shelf, electrical equipment on another, armour parts on a third. Everything here was Clorinda’s own work, her own design, but it was all owned by Gisbourne. All prototypes with nothing yet produced at scale, they would nonetheless notice its absence. Clorinda would have to make a plan before that happened.

In this first hour of waking, dreams floated up through her memory. Protestors hauled into the air by thick, black tentacles. Bloody organs transferred from young to old. A sickly woman running on an energy mill until she collapses from exhaustion. Pure, naked hunger on the streets. In one dream, she watched herself. She was standing on a balcony, a glittering ballgown hanging from her shoulders and a glass of delicate champagne poised in her hand. Below the balcony, wails and a churn of human flesh. Smoke and ash. She was laughing.

It wasn’t real now. She'd left it behind. There was no tipping point, no one cruel act that made her storm out in disgust. Instead, a moral nausea had seeped into her thoughts and coloured her perception of every moment.

“Good morning, C.” Vix’s voice surrounded her. “What would you like to do today?”

“I… I don’t know.” She hadn’t thought about it. It was 0633, the sun was mostly up and the hours stretched languorously ahead of her. Excitement wrestled fear in her chest.

“I suppose we could go for a walk.”

\*

Hours passed. Clorinda’s mind cleared as she embraced the simplicity of placing one foot before the other; it was all she had to do. The trees filled her field of vision. Their trunks were thick and covered with moss and lichen, knotty and gnarled. Clorinda touched them gently, enjoying the variety of textures. Soft moss, smooth wood, brittle branches, dense mud. A stark contrast to the rough concrete and hard onyx behind the city wall.

She felt tired, not catching her breath; she wasn’t fit enough for days of trekking. She crouched on a bed of ferns.

“Let’s wait a minute.”

“Sure, C”. Vix’s voice came from a lightweight, colourful drone that hovered behind Clorinda. “Here.” The drone dropped a protein bar and a can of sparkling water into Clorinda’s hands.

“Thanks,” she panted. “Okay… rook c7.”

\*

Night had fallen but Clorinda couldn’t sleep. Her body was exhausted but her mind felt frantic. She kept half-forming and discarding plans and ideas, still sparring with Vix on the chessboard. She couldn’t believe this was really her life. Since childhood, she had been taught to fear the wilderness and now here she was in the centre of it, surrounded by the sounds of owls and crickets and animals she had never known.

She sprung out of bed and made her way to the shuttle. Buckling into the pilot’s seat, she detached from the main body of the forge and rose noiselessly into the night sky. Sailing over the treetops, she opened the roof and breathed in deeply. She enjoyed the soft rush of air on her face and took in the delicate scents of jasmine and pine. Then she looked straight up and gasped at the sight of the stars.

“Oh, Vix…”

She kept the craft hovering and simply stared.

She kept sailing until well after dawn, surveying the landscape. There was a waterfall that intrigued her and a huge variety of trees. As the sun rose, animals of all kinds began to emerge or retire; most could only be seen through Clorinda’s thermal vision filter.

What surprised her was the sight of homes hidden beneath the canopy. Although now a wild wood, this area was once a small town. From the air and with the use of sonar, Clorinda mapped out the network of abandoned cottages scattered through the woodland.

“This place was abandoned,” she reasoned aloud to Vix. “Must be a hundred years ago or more, judging by the height of the trees.”

She picked a house at random and touched the shuttle down by its side, weaving between branches as she did so. A curved brick wall stood a few meters ahead. Clorinda examined it, brushing leaves to the side. It was covered in moss and lichen but the text was still visible, carved in elegant gold letters.

2028

She pushed through thick brambles and stinging nettles on her way to the front door. She peered through the windows and saw ancient furniture, chewed and torn by a century’s worth of nesting beasts. But there were books on the shelves too, and art on the walls. Letting curiosity overcome fear, she used the strength in her prosthetic hand to wrench the lock from the door and push it open, gingerly. “Sorry…”, she whispered to whoever had once held the keys. She found tins of fruit and beans in the kitchen and an ancient gas stove. She found books on cookery and flicked through, marvelling at the colours and the authors’ smiling faces. Upstairs, she found a room filled with soft furnishings and a wardrobe bursting with elegant (though now moth-eaten and thin) dresses and suits. She found a child’s room, with a cot, toys and a dressing-up box emblazoned with a name, ‘Carrie’. She wondered who Carrie had been and where she had gone; she knew the most likely circumstance and felt a brief chill.

Brushing silt from the windowpane, Clorinda examined the branches and leaves outside. A bird was perched in front of her face, with only the thinnest layer of glass between them. It was small and delicate with a white chest, a grey body, and fierce, orange eyes glowing from its black head. Its gaze pierced Clorinda. She felt as though it was watching her dreams.

\*

Nine weeks was a long time in the wood. Early on, Clorinda had asked Vix to stop reminding her of the time and to take away all clocks from the shuttle and forge’s displays. She wanted instead to follow the sun’s rhythm.

The days were indulgently slow. For the previous five years, Clorinda had worked harder and faster than anyone else at Gisbourne. Before, she had outpaced and outthought her peers at university, and earlier still, she had trounced even her most ambitious classmates at London’s most competitive private school. But now, she walked slowly. Her feet lingered between steps; often, she stopped to pick a daisy or a blade of tall grass. When once she listened to propulsive beats as she ran on the energy mills, now she listened to nothing but birdsong and the gentle sway of branches in the wind.

She felt guilty. She felt lazy. This feeling prodded her into action in the forge. Having washed herself and her clothes in the waterfall (the shocking cold losing its sting with time), she decided to transform this water into a source of energy. In the forge, she created a small hydroelectric system from wood and tin, then installed it under the waterfall. The wheel spun and with pride, she watched as the monitor showed the kilowatts ticking up.

Next she turned to the house. The boiler and cooker were useless; they ran on a gas supply that had been switched off or run dry centuries ago. But the roof was fitted with solar panels. Balanced on the hovering shuttle, Clorinda carefully cleared them of years’ worth of muck and debris. She gently pushed the panels away and cut them back just a little, opening up a space in the canopy from which they could absorb the light. Vix printed a set of smaller, more efficient panels and Clorinda attached them all around the house, supplementing their power by connecting her hydro-wheel.

She designed an induction hob to replace the kitchen’s obsolete gas tools and spent a happy day installing it. When she cooked her first meal of simple steamed vegetables, she congratulated herself on bringing this ancient house closer to a functioning home.

\*

Another month passed like this. Exploring, foraging fruit and fungi, renovating the cottage and making power - all of this filled Clorinda’s days. When her work was over, she brewed tea from freshly picked nettles and played chess with Vix until she fell asleep.

She was content, still enjoying the solitude. She did not yet want for human company, though she knew that at some point, she must. Who would she want to see first? Who would she miss? Not Steven, her lab partner and erstwhile ‘best friend’. She worried that she'd led him on. Not Jemma, a childhood confidant. Each meetup had grown increasingly strained, too full of references to events from too long ago. Not Magnus and Iris, or Ash and Mya. Tacking onto a couple was enervating.

Robert Loxley had not crossed her mind in years, but it was his face that now shone from her screen as it blared an obnoxious ring.

“What in the…” she muttered. He wasn’t part of Gisbourne and so wasn’t on her blocked list. He might have been if he’d even occurred to her before she left. They had been obsessed with one another in their final year of school but he broke contact abruptly and disappeared, she later learned, to fight in the West. That was six years ago.

She ignored the call but he tried again. She declined. It rang again.

“For God’s sake,” she muttered as she answered the call. “Robbie?”

“Clorinda!” came his sparky voice, though she thought it may be a little deeper and sadder than she remembered. “Are you in Nottingham? We… me and Alanna, you remember Alanna? We need your help.”

Clorinda said nothing.

This is a recipe style that takes a light roast at a relatively coarse grind and yeets it with high flow. So like a turbo shot but at much lower pressure (1-2bars).  The result is not your typical espresso. It's bold, juicy and surprisingly sweet and round. After watching Lance's video about his fav. recipes yesterday I was inspired to try to replicate his Low Contact shot. 

* Ratio 1:3 (18g : 54g)
* Kettle Temp 95°C
* Robot: Cold, not preheated at all
* Grind Size: Coarse (on my ZP6 I'm at about 2, on my K6 I'm in 40-50 clicks from burr lock)
* Ramp until pressure reads 1.5bar
* Stay there for a second until the puck is fully saturated (and there should be coffee already in the cup by this time)
* Ramp further but not over 4 bar until target yield
* Overall time \~15s +/-5

The result is not the acid hammer that you might expect. Quite the opposite. It's a well rounded, sweet cup with a very different body than your normal espresso. It works great with really light roasts and is quite forgiving. I can't wrap my head around why this works but it does for me and if you are into light roasts I highly recommend giving it a shot. 

For me it's a total game changer as I don't need to worry about preheating and get cup without any harshness.",10,1739176847.0,CafelatRobot,2,1.0,False

1im1kpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToEMS/comments/1im1kpp/nightmares/,Nightmares,"Ayo. So I am a 20 year old EMT. I’ve worked rural and am now working city EMS. I did Emt school through my senior year of highschool when I was 17 and tested as soon as I turned 18. Got a job immediately when I graduated. Technically I was hired prior to my graduation date, but had to wait to start until I turned in my papers. My mother is a big figure head within EMS particularly in Indiana, and lesser known else where, So i’ve grown up around the culture and life style my whole life. 

Anyhow, that a big long build up to what I really wanted to ask. I understand we aren’t therapists and i’m not looking for a therapist answer. I’m looking for my brother or sister to help me out with issues that they have probably struggled with. 

When I was doing my clinical hospital rotation during EMT school, I was working in a pretty understaffed hospital. There was this pt. He had schizophrenia, but had never been aggressive or hostile in any way in the past. I was asked to be a sitter for like 8 minutes so this nurse could get coffee. I genuinely didn’t mind because i had already signed off on a lot of patients and needed the psych exam. 

The pt. started getting mildly upset about me not being able to turn him in bed. I reassured him that someone will help soon and i am unable to. He was a normal sized man who had no issues moving prior. I listed to him vent. He kept coming back to the bed thing and I kept apologizing and deflecting to a different topic. He would get angrier every time I’d bring it up, till finally I got pulled out of the room due to safety. I was placed in a different pts room to just do a quick medical assessment after that. 

While I was in the new pts. room just monitoring alone. A nurse kinda rushed in, shuts the door closes the curtain and tells me not to leave until she personally comes and says i can leave the room. I then heard a lot of rustling, a bunch of cops, nurses and the doctor rush by the door. Lots of yelling.  

Eventually it quieted down and i was released from the room and let out into the hospital environment again. The nurse told me “the pt. was trying to find you. He said he was going to kill you. He is in different care now, but we need you to stay with a nurse at all times now.” 

Ever since then I go through spurts of having intense nightmares about the situation. Its not the worst thing ive dealt with, but i’ve never had issues lasting longer than a night.

Every day I wake up with suicidal thoughts, apathy and can wander aimlessly around the apartment for half a day with a feeling of meaninglessness and futility (I do not have depression, I have apathy and anhedonia).

But as soon as I drink strong coffee, everything goes away. As if the dark fog in my head dissipates.

I have plans and ideas, strength to live, my willpower improves, it is no longer difficult for me to get up from the couch and do household chores. And even communication with people becomes pleasant, and not routine.

For some of us (not all), SPD is caused by problems with dopamine or dopamine receptors (perhaps we have many other problems with chemistry and areas of the brain, but this has not been studied much). According to some studies, coffee stimulates the growth of dopamine receptors in the long term. This may be why it works.

“Hmm, is it Noah Kent or Adam Wrangler?” Judge Agnivanshi asked. She looked down at Adam, who was standing in front of everybody. The room was filled with people. Adam could see the judge had not thought that such a case would get so much attention from the aliens in the sector.  She stared at him, and Adam just smiled.

“I was given the number 001312409 when the Cartel made me; the orphanages in Kent gave me the name Noah Kent. When I left it, I legally changed my name to Wrangler in memory of the police officer who died saving me and all the children the cartel had made. Adam was my choice. So, I prefer to be named Adam Wrangler if it pleases the court.”

She took a second to think about it, then just nodded. Adam could hear some murmuring in the background, and then he mentally cursed himself. That information was for humans; god knows what the locals would do with it.

‘Well, Mr … excuse me, do you even have human status? I get the impression you are a clone. Are you under stewardship?” She said, looking a little annoyed at it all.

“Yes, we all were given full human status; just because I was designed in a lab does not mean I’m any less human. I still have two DNA donors like anybody else. Or a mother and father, if you like.” Adam didn’t like this part. He was supported to just get up, confirm his identity, pledge guilty or not guilty, and then give a short declaration.  

“hmm, “ She looked at her pad and adjusted her seat. “Then we can start. Are you Mr Adam Wrangler, previously known as Noah Kent and 001312409?”

“Yes, Your honor. I am.” Adam replied.

“Good. You are accused of owning slaves, as well as owning a slave pen. An Action that is illegal under Earth's commercial laws. How do you plead?” She looked at him and he could see how much she wanted the case to be over quickly.

“Your honor. I plead that these actions were committed outside earths Jurisdictions therefore, I’m not Guilty of these crimes.” Adam said, and she just stared at him.

“So you wish to go to trial? Then please be seated and we will start.”  She was not happy with his reply and Adam nodded and sat down. Mr Gong and Ms Min-Na smiled to him.

“She really don’t like you,” Min-Na said and Mr Gong nodded in agreement.

“I think you should speak as little as possible now. I knew she was strict, but this is ridiculous.  Why question your status?”

“Because she wants to make me less human; if I’m guilty, she blames it on me being a faulty clone that didn’t act properly,  and she could seize the system,” Adam said as he looked at her. Then turned to Min-Na. “Is Sig-San back?”

“Yes, but you're not using him,” Min-Na said and Adam smiled.

“Just ask him what secrets she hides. That’s all. “

“If you are finished chatting, then perhaps we can start?”  Judge Agnivanshi asked, then looked to the audience.

“Before we start, I would like to address the audience. I do not want this trial to turn into a theater; these are serious matters we are dealing with, and I will not accept that any side tries to play to the audience.  We are simply here to review the evidence and let the Jury decide if Mr Wrangler is guilty or not in the act of owning slaves. With that, I will ask the prosecutor to put forth their case.” Then she indicated to Mr Fry to stand up.

Xavier Fry was a tall, well-built blond man who might as well have been a movie actor. He started to put forth the evidence.  There was no doubt that Adam owned slaves as he had provided them with the contract for the transfer of ownership of the different slaves as well as the contract Adam had signed with each slave in his possession. A number that, at the point of arrest, had been 17 203 adults. Adam could see the jury was shocked by the number, and for a moment, it looked like the case was over at that moment.  Xavier then continued by explaining that Adam also had regular employees, and most of the now about 100 000 inhabitants were employees, including some children.  Mr Gong looked at him, and Adam chuckled. “I gave some kids some money for doing scans and access to play with the drones. It felt wrong to have them do the scans and not get paid.”

Min-Na chuckled. “Traditionally, they would not even get paid here.”

When Carl Gong stood up, the jury stared at Adam.

“Yes, all of this is correct. They showed you the contract of sales but not the contract he made with the slave bound. A contract that now has been copied and used by companies in this sector among regular Employees and Employers.  Why? Because it’s a good job contract. But I digress, why did he buy slaves? And what is a slave? These are just as important as the most important questions of them all. Was he bound by Earth's jurisdictions when he bought them? But we will also have to take into account intent. Was it mr Wrangler's intent to keep slaves or make them free from such bonds? We will prove that first, System GKB-12658, is currently not part of Earth's jurisdiction and is just under the Galactic Federation of Trade, and such falls under their jurisdictions of this federation where slavery is both a legal and a common practice.  And while Mr Wrangler himself is a known advocate in these regions as an anti-slaver, he is still bound by the laws, and his seeking to become one of Earth’s colonies was simply so he could free the slaves. Which has now been done. “

“I do not care much about the theatrical speeches in my courtroom, Mr Gong.  We are not here to decide his intentions but if he broke the law. Please continue.” Judge Agnivansh said.

Adam watched them argue back and forth on the different merits, and it became increasingly clear that the judge did not like him. When they broke for the day, he was tired and just wished to go to sleep. He was led out by armed guards and shuttled back to prison.  Evelyn was waiting for him, clearly upset.

“She has already decided that you are guilty, this was a bad idea.” She hugged him as she spoke.  His lawyers retreated to give them some peace.

“Maybe, but it’s the jury who decided after all.”  He said, and she looked worried.

“They don’t seem convinced either.”

“Some of them did. That blond woman.”

“She just wants you, she doesn’t care, she will flip the moment she finds out you got a pregnant fiancée, which reminds me. We need to get married fast, just in case you get convicted. We have a big wedding later. Oh my god, if they convict you, they might send you back to earth in standard jail. The cartel will get to you then. “ Evelyn suddenly panicked.

“Easy, if I get convicted, I can still appeal, and that has to happen here at Dirt, and if we do become an Earth Coloney, then they have to use our prison. Which means I have to stay here.” He said with a smile, trying to calm her down, but she didn’t believe him.

“No, they might hand you over to the locals as a criminal. Find an obscure law to turn you into a slave, just to punish you. I know we kill the judge; it will be easy, and we can blame it on that other guy. What's his name again? Kun-Nar? Right? Yeah, I get Sig-San to fix it. Failed assignation attempt on you, and it takes out the judge instead.” She broke the hug and paced as she ranted on. Adam looked at her and chuckled, then sat back, ordering a cup of coffee from the maid.

“No, you can’t. We have to save, ration is there isn’t enough coffee, remember?” She said as she saw the cup being brought to him.

“What are you talking about? I know there was a shortage, but you fixed that, right?” He sipped his coffee, then realized something and stood up, giving her the cup. “Drink! That’s and order!”

She looked at him and then took the cup and took a sip, then one more, and then drank the rest in one big gulp. “Ahhh, I needed that. So What were we talking about, yes, the judge and the coffee. We don’t have enough coffee until we can get it replaced, so we are about to have an armed rebellion on our hands.”

Adam took the empty cup, looked at it then put on the table. “Did you ask my brother if he brought any?”

“Your brother? Do you mean John Mo? Why would he have coffee for us?” She asked, confused. Adam started to laugh.

“Seriously? Come on, Eve. Think, why would John Mo have coffee?  I mean he just came here with three colony ships filled with humans as well as a military escort. “

She looked at him and then slapped her forehead. “Damnit, of course. I will contact him. He is bound to have some we can steal.” She said.

“Buy, we can buy. We have the money.” He said, and she grinned.  
“Naw, I will just tell Doc they have coffee and we don’t.”

Adam shook his head and then ordered two more cups. “Anyway, nobody touches the judge, and I gave Sig-San a job, so don’t disturb him, okay?”

She gave him a mock salute. “Yes, sir!” Then she sat down as the coffee arrived and just looked at him.

“What? “

“Just wondering why you keep up with me. After all.”

“Because you do the same with me. You stop me from the same bullshit that I stop you from doing. And I love you silly.” He said as he nonchalantly sipped his cup.

She winked and leaned back, looking at him, then put her hand on her tummy. “Did you hear that? Your dad loves me. Now we just got to keep him from going to jail.”

“Don’t do anything stupid. Let the case go as it should. Remember, they are watching even on Earth.“ He said with a smile.

“Yeah, about that. The whole trail? How much did that cost you?”

“One million—it's been filmed and sent. Now, I only have to hope the right people see it back there. I know some who are watching, but I don't know if it's enough, "" he said, and Evelyn suddenly smiled.

“Where is Arus? “ She asked as he could see her mind working.

“At his office in Piridas? Why?”

She got up, kissed him, and winked.  “Oh, nothing. I just remembered I needed to do something. Don’t wait up.”

“No killing!”

“Not even metaphorically?“ She grinned, and before he could reply, she had gone. He took a deep breath. Whatever she planned, he hoped it wasn’t going to destroy his plan.

He got up and went to the lawyer's office, which was filled with lawyers and assistants; he saw humans and new aliens that had come with Carls's firm. He was quickly introduced to the whole team, and then they started.  They went over the whole trial again as they studied every aspect of it.  Mostly, there was a need to explain how the different cultures crashed or overlapped in systems. Adam started to realize he needed to find a cultural attaché when this was all over, somebody who could melt the different cultures into their own, for the lack of words, Dirt culture. But now he needed to find out what was going on.

 

In the late evening, a haran man came to the office and asked for Min-Na; he was a sophisticated man with early signs of becoming elderly around his neck with clear signs of bite marks; Min-Na blushed as a teenager when she saw him. All her lawyers treated him with utter respect, and Adam stood up , put his palms together in almost, and bowed his head slightly. The elderly man returned the greeting and then offered his hand in a shake. “I finally get to meet you Mr Wrangler, I am Admiral Kon-Na, Min-Na’s husband. I am truly sorry that I did not get to meet you earlier. My campaign has kept me from this sector for years. I just arrived. I must say your military is quite strong. I think my battlecruiser and fleet got your Admiral Hicks a little upset.”

Adam just stared at him. “Wait, what?” Then, he caught himself. “I’m truly sorry that you arrived into this mess, and I was unaware that Min-Na was married.” He shot her a glance, and she just grinned. “But I’m extremely happy to meet you, and I think we can manage the rest of the night without your dear wife. Perhaps we can have dinner later. I would love to get to know you and discover why your wife has hidden you from me.”  He said with a smile. Kon-Na chuckled.

“Thank you. I will take you up on that offer. Perhaps tomorrow evening after the trial?” He replied and Adam nodded.

“That sounds like a plan.” Then he looked at Min-Na. “Go with your husband now. We can finish up here.”

She looked around the room, and her employees bowed their heads. She simply nodded back, “If you insist.” Then she left the room with her husband. Carl came up to him and looked after them.

“What was all that about?”

“That was me finding out my lawyer has a Haran fleet at her calling, and if his bite marks at the neck are fresh tomorrow, then their relationship is strong.”

“Why bitemarks?” carl asked.

“It's how the Haran gets married; the bride bites her husband in the neck to mark him, and she will do so as often as she pleases to keep the scare fresh. It's why people say the Haran ladies eat their husbands.” He said, and Carl looked at a Haran male who grinned and showed his neck, a fresh set of scars, then winked, and a female grinned, showing a set of short white fangs.

Adam finished up and retired when he got found out he had several missed calls from Admiral Hicks, so he called him up.

“Yes, Admiral?”  
“WHAT THE HELL? What do those seventeen warships do here?”

“They belong to my lawyer's husband, an admiral in the Haran navy. He is simply here to visit his wife. I’m pretty sure he was as surprised as you to find a fleet here. He told me to apologize for scaring you. And if I know these people right, then he will soon try to befriend you and ask for a joint military exercise. But why ask me? Didn’t  Roks take care of this?”

“Yeah, he did. As did the Major. I just don’t like to be surprised like this. What else do you have hidden out here?” he asked.

“To be honest, there isn’t much. We have a pirate hunter named Kira Lam, and we are working on a conclave of Mega corporations.”

Hicks checked his files and then whistled. “Kira Lam? Is it this one we are talking about? “ He said as an image of Kira showed up, and Adam confirmed.

”Yes, why?”

“Oh, nothing; I will contact her later. Nothing to worry about.” He said, and the image vanished.  

“Oh, there is a shortage of coffee at the colony, did Evelyn contact you about it?” Adam said and Hicks nodded.

Hi everybody, just one chapter left of book 2. And good news: [Project Dirt](https://a.co/d/fJm26Bh) is now available on Amazon in Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, Softcover, and Hardcover. It has been edited and adjusted slightly to ensure continuity. Also, Hara's name has been changed to Dara (just so it won't be too close to Haran).

If you decide to get a copy or just want to be nice to me, please leave a review on Amazon and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227765698-project-dirt). It would help me a lot; besides, the more I sell, the more my wife lets me write. After Project Dirt is finished, I have the Bug Hunt series to complete and an idea for a bounty hunter (all set in the same universe).

Sincerely,

1im1bwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1im1bwo/how_do_i_raise_my_concerns_about_moving_away_soon/,How do I raise my concerns about moving away soon to someone I've only recently started seeing?,"I (21F) have never been in a relationship before. I didn't really want to be in one until last year. However, I'm in my last semester of college, and over the holiday season, I told myself that I did not want to start dating now since I'm going to be moving away in May.

Over the break before this semester, I got a text from someone (20M) who I only just met the previous semester in a class. He asked me how my break was going, and we messaged a bit. I didn't really think anything of it at the time. At the very beginning of the semester, he asked if I wanted to go get coffee. I said yes because he was very sweet and I didn't want to turn him down. We recently went to a museum and on a couple of short hikes, and I said yes for the same reasons.

He wants to go to a beach soon and on some more hikes, and he's asking me for days when I'm free. I'm feeling very stressed with coursework at the moment, and I feel like I do not have any free time on weekdays. Weekends are also challenging, as I'll soon often have Saturdays completely filled with athletic commitments and Sundays for homework. In the past, I've rarely gone on day trips due to limited free time; one of my close friends and I would occasionally go on one when there was a holiday/long weekend. I really don't have the time to go anywhere for more than a couple hours, and some weekends I definitely won't be able to go anywhere.

He's very kind, smart, and we have similar academic interests. He made me a present, and he's called me beautiful, which no other guy has ever said to me.

The issues are that:

1. I barely have time to go on the trips that he wants to.
2. I'm leaving in May, and should things progress with him, I don't want to be in a long-distance relationship (he's in his second year). I don't know exactly where I'll be (I'm still waiting on graduate school decisions), but it will be far from my current school, and I already know that I do not want to travel back.

I don't know what to do. From what he's said and done, I think it's pretty clear that he likes me. I don't want to hurt him, but I don't see a future in this relationship. I don't know if it's because he's over a year younger or because I'm leaving in a few months, but it's just how I feel.

I have enjoyed the things we've done so far, but I had much more time then since it was the beginning of the semester. I would still like to go on some trips with him, but I don't know if I should say something. He also suggested something that we could do over the summer in my hometown, which means he is definitely thinking towards the future. 

Should I say something now? If so, what? I'm really anxious about this. I'm worried that if I do, I'll hurt his feelings. But if I don't, he might feel even worse in the future. I want to be friends, but I think he deserves to be with someone his age (a 1.5 year gap feels significant for me, especially given the circumstances). ",1,1739175423.0,Advice,2,0.99,False
