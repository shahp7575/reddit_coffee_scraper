Great grades thru high school, tons of extra curriculars, volunteering, and a lifeguard at 16.   Already in college, bought her own car, pays for her insurance and gas by herself.   Pays her own phone bill.  Etc….  Still lives at home while going to school but just recently accepted a promotion at work that is full-time.   I do have concerns that her candle will burn out, but I learned from my own mistakes so I’ve just been planning to be available to catch her.

This month, she missed her car insurance payment. Fortunately I caught it at 3am and covered it before businesses opened, and I set her up an overdraft. (It’s a joint account so I can see all her transactions, I co-signed the phone and insurance and visa for school). She paid me back before she left for school. 

Tomorrow is payday, so I was checking accounts and noticed her account is lower than expected, so I took a quick look.   And then a much closer look.   In Nov, she has purchased fast-food or coffee 44 times for an average of $33 per day.

I’m reeling.   No adjectives available for my shock.   How can an 18 year old justify this?   what can I do?",2,1732841284.0,Parenting,2,1.0,False

My name is John, I work as a data entry clerk for a small insurance company. Every day, I sit at my desk, surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. The task of inputting data into the computer has become a mindless routine. Staring at my computer screen my eyes begin to feel heavy as i reach for my coffee. I take a sip of my mocha coffee before returning to work. The coffee seemed to do the trick. I spent hours typing, but it felt like minutes. As i looked at the stack i had just finished, i felt a sense of pride. That feeling was replaced with dread as i saw the remaining towers of papers i needed to work on.  I was tired but I knew that i had a deadline. I grabbed my coffee and took a sip, what i expected to taste, and what i tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha but when i took a sip of my coffee, the coffee was caramel. I hated caramel flavoring. I spit it out and turned my cup, assuming i had somehow swapped with someone else. However what I saw when i turned my cup confused me, the cup had my name on it. I tossed the coffee cup into the green trash bin under my desk and got back to work. I typed for hours and watched as my co-workers went home for the evening. It was dark when I finished my work for the day. I Called a cab, i always call the same cab company when i get off work late. The driver for the night shift is really nice and after many rides together, i consider him my friend. I Sat On The bench outside and waited for my cab to arrive. As I waited i went to pull out a ciggarette and felt a piece of paper in my pocket. I fished the paper out of my pocket and upon further inspection i realized that it was a Receipt for the coffee i had purchased earlier. The receipt read 1 Large Mocha Coffee. Before i could really think about what the receipt meant i heard a car approaching. I looked up to see my favorite cab driver. I had a long day and a weird thing happened with my coffee but now i was among friends. I Waved and smiled at him, He looked annoyed and didn't wave or smile back. As i entered the cab, I expected to feel relief that the work day was over and i was excited to talk with the driver. however this time the cab felt different. The once warm and friendly cab driver that i had many enjoyable conversations with in the past now Adverted his gaze when he caught me studying him in the rear view mirror. I asked how his day was and he never answered. The only time the driver spoke to me was to verify that we were at the drop off destination. I Looked through the window and saw that we were, i thanked the driver and tipped him as usual. He hastily sped off without much conversation and I wondered what had happened to change the demeanor of such a formerly friendly man. I walked up to my apartment building and as i approached the door to the lobby i could hear my neighbors fighting inside. I looked through the window and saw one of my neighbors an elderly man in a fist fight with another tenant in the building. I hurriedly turned my key in the door and rushed inside. When i entered i found that the lobby was completely empty, not only was there nobody fighting, there wasn't anyone there at all. Just me in a state of fight or flight, completely by myself. I felt foolish for a moment and decided that i really just needed to rest. I went into my apartment and after stumbling to my bed i fell asleep almost instantly. I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing. I answered the phone and it was my boss, My boss told me that i was lucky i wasn't fired. Confused by this i asked him why. He told me that I didn't show up to work yesterday and that i better show up today if i wanted to keep my job. Before i could argue that i was there yesterday he hung up.  I hurriedly got ready for work and called the cab company. As i waited for the cab to come i smoked a cigarette. When the cab pulled up i was surprised to see that the person driving it was not the morning driver but the night time cab driver. I was even more surprised when he seemed to be in a great mood.  Last night was a little odd but at least today he seemed to be his normal and usual self. We chatted and laughed the whole drive to work and it made me less nervous about what i knew was for sure going to be a rough conversation with my boss. I made my way into the building, The lobby pulsed with a nervous energy, its very walls seeming to vibrate with my anxiety. I made my way to my boss' office and as i stood outside his door, mentally preparing myself for his lecture. Before i could enter his office, the door swung open and as my boss emerged from the doorway, I was confused because he didn't seem to be angry like he was on the phone this morning. His eyes lit up as he saw me and he said "" Good Morning John, I really appreciate you staying late yesterday."" What should have been a moment of relief, was instead a moment of confusion and dread, creating an uneasy feeling in my stomach. I was confused, I asked my boss why he called me this morning about me missing work. The smile that once seemed carved into his face dropped suddenly, replaced by a look of intense confusion. He tilted his head to the side and said "" I didnt call you this morning john."" The unease in my stomach intensified as i slid my hand into my pocket and pulled out my phone. As my boss and i stood each locked in this uncomfortable moment, i checked my call history. I saw that he infact DID call me this morning. "" If you look right here, You'll see you did call me"" I said to my boss as i handed him my phone. He took the phone and immediately froze. he looked at the phone, He looked at me, he looked back at the phone and giggled. ""John, You do realise that you've handed me a dead phone, right?""  He slid me back my phone and laughed as he said ""You're funny john, I don't always understand your humour but i know you're funny, have a great work day"" Before i could respond he had already slid back into his office. I made my way to my desk, as i passed co workers they smiled at me but i could feel their smiles fade the moment i looked away. I sat down at my desk and accidentally kicked over the bin. As i went to put the bin upright, i was thrown off by its color. As far back as i could remember my bin much like all the other bins in the office was green. The bin that i was looking at was bright red. I heard a noise and looked up to see a coworker walking by, their sudden presence startled me and i blurted out "" New Bins!"" My coworker looked at me like i was crazy before asking "" What?"" I explained to my coworker that my bin had been replaced by a red one. My coworker looked at me bewildered and said something that I didn't believe. ""The bins have always been red"". I stood and looked at the other cubicles in the office and sure enough, every bin was red.  Still in disbelief i pulled my bin from under my desk and in the bin was a disposable coffee cup with my name written on the side. My mind reeled and i was trying to make sense of the world around me but it kept getting stranger.  I slid my bin back under my desk and watched my coworker walk away. If my coworker would have just walked away in a way that made sense  I might have been able to explain away all the other oddities I've been experiencing. What they did when they walked away however made no sense. I watched them walk to the back of the room by the printer and straight through the white wall. ""What the fuck?"" I said out loud as i walked to the same wall i had just watched my coworker vanish through. I touched the wall and it was solid. There was no way that what i saw was possible. My head hurt and I  knew that something was wrong either with reality or my perception of reality. I found my boss and told him that i needed to leave early for the day before i stepped outside and lit a ciggarette. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and saw that it was fully charged. I called the cab company, and before i could sit on the bench i saw them pulling up to the curb. I got in to the cab and the driver looked familiar but I couldn't remember his name. He was being very friendly, but there was something wrong with his face. I realised that while the cab drivers face looked happy and kind his eyes looked wild and angry almost demonic. I asked him what was wrong with his eyes, and he laughed in octave I've never heard from him before, The sky darkened and i lost my ability to breathe, The car seemed to stand still as if time had frozen. the only proof that time wasn't frozen completely was the rapid beat of my own heart pounding in my chest. In that moment i felt both like i was going to die soon and that whatever frightening thing was happening wasn't ever going to stop. However just as quickly as it came, the moment passed. I found myself shaking and staring through my fingers at the floor, I was so afraid to look at the driver, for fear that i would not see a friendly face. I only dared look up when i heard the driver ask me a question. In a very normal and familiar voice the cab driver asked me ""Hey buddy, are you okay?"". I looked up and recognized him as the night driver for the cab company. I told him that i was fine, just a little ill. He mentioned a doctor he was going to call on my behalf. I told him he didn't have to but he really insisted. I thanked and paid the driver before stepping out of the cab. As I watched the cab drive away it was side swiped off of the road by a public bus. The bus slamming into the side of the cab forcefully, so hard that it looked like they became one. like some kind of vehicular hammer head shark. I blinked hard and rubbed my eyes and when my eyes reopened and readjusted, i was able to see the cab driver turn the corner of the road, driving the cab completely undamaged. There was no bus and there was no crash. My head hurt, i decided i needed to get home, i hurried into my apartment building, in the lobby there was nobody however every apartment door stood open, even mine. I walked through the door of my apartment but the door that i exited though was the door to my office building. I was so afraid that my legs gave out and i fell on the ground. The cold concrete was a reminder that i was certainly not in my apartment. it was so cold that i instinctively jumped up back to my feet. I looked back at the building and it was closed. Everyone had left. I checked my phone and this time it didnt turn on. It began to snow as i decided that i would sleep on the bench. I could feel the cold from the snow as i slept. I woke up early the next morning shivering in my warm bed, in my apartment. I checked my phone and realised that i was going to be late for work, I hurriedly got dressed and called the cab company. I waited for the cab to come and smoked a cigarette. When the cab driver arrived i was nearing the end of my cigarette so i flicked it into the street. As i entered i noticed that it was a totally different cab driver. i assumed it must have been someone new. I asked what happened to the usual driver and the new cab driver told me that he was the only cab driver the company had and that he wasn't new. We rode in silence as he dropped me off at work. I paid him but he refused a tip and gave me a card to call for a doctor. I Took it to be kind but I wasn't planning on calling the doctor. As i stepped out of the taxi i shuddered sight of the bench. I don't know if it was a dream or not that i spent the night there but regardless i wasn't a fan of the bench at that moment. I looked past the bench at my job, I was eager to get back to work and get my mind off all of the craziness. I walked in but everyone was busy working so nobody said hi. I did however catch some odd glances from people before they went back to their work. I sat down at my desk. When i tried to log on to the computer, it told me my credentials were invalid, As i tried and failed to get into my work computer, i heard someone approaching. I looked up to see my boss coming with an angry look on his face and two armed security guards. I tell him that I'm struggling to get into my computer, He says to me in an angry tone "" That's because it isn't your computer. You've Never Worked here"". My boss had security escort me out of the building and as i heard the doors lock behind me, I saw the bench covered in snow, in an otherwise sunny environment devoid of snow. I wiped the snow off the bench and reached in my pocket to grab my phone. I called a cab and waited for it to come. I smoked a cigarette while i waited. The cab came and i got in. once i was in the cab, I heard the driver say "" short trip today?"" when i looked up I was glad to see that it was the night time cab driver that i remembered. I was frightened by my job, i was frightened by my neighbors, I was frightened by the cab. I wondered to myself when life got so discoherent and scary. My thoughts were interrupted by the driver letting me know that we had arrived at my apartment. I thanked him and stepped out of the cab. as i got out of the cab i remembered that i had forgotten to pay him, so i reached in my pocket for my wallet. but i couldn't find it. When I turned around to see if i had left it in the cab i saw that he had since left. I turned back around to face my apartment and my heart sank. It was night time now and I was standing in an empty lot. Where a building might have once stood but where no building stood now. I stood alone in the lot and noticed that it was snowing. I walked back towards the road and found a bench covered in snow. I wiped the snow away and laid down to rest. I woke up to the sound of a car horn. It was the cab driver. He asked me if i was getting in or not. I chose to get in, it would be a nice break from the weather. He studied me from the side of his eye and asked ""Same place as usual?' I answered yes and as we rode he mentioned that i should call that doctor he gave me the card for. I thanked him again for the card and reassured him i would call the doctor. He gave me a kind nod and left. as he drove off into the distance i watched him go but nothing crazy or unexpected happened. Maybe I don't have to call that doctor i thought. I turned away from the road but what i saw didn't make any sense at all. I saw that bench that I've suffered on so many times and that was not a surprise to me. What surprised me, What shocked me to my core was the decaying structure of what appeared to be a defunct out of use building. The building looked similar to the one I considered my job but it was in such a state of disrepair it would be hard to believe anyone has been there for years. I opened the front door and the smell of still air made the place feel extra abandoned. I heard rhythmic tapping sounds from deeper into the building. I was so scared, I didn't want to search any further but i felt like i had to, i had already gotten this far and i wasn't sure of the alternative. I followed the sound of typing, it grew louder as i drew closer. I was halfway to my destination when i realised where i was headed. I was a layer cake of dread and anxiety when i walked up to my desk. I peeked over the top of my desk and i saw myself sitting in the dark staring at a blank monitor, typing. I asked Who are you? The face of the man shifted through that of each of my coworkers, to the face of my boss and back to my own face."" Im Your Mental Illness. "" The entity said. ""I'm not mentally ill, "" I replied ""Yet here you stand in an abandoned building talking to yourself"" The entity said. ""You might not like it but, every day for 8 hours a day you sit here and type"" The entity added. "" What am i typing?"" I asked. The entity replied, ""nothing at all"".  I couldn't believe what i was hearing. I felt rage boiling and Asked the entity ""is it all a lie? -"" Is everything that i know about myself a lie? "" The entity paused for a moment and explained that yes, everything i knew about my life was a lie. I don't have a job as a data entry clerk, I don't have an apartment. "" what about the cab driver? How am i paying for cab rides if I don't have a job?"" I asked the entity. The Entity responded "" The cab driver gives you free rides because it is winter time and he is kind""  ""I know that I work for the insurance company, I've got co-workers and a boss."" I said To the entity, my strongest counter argument. What the entity said to me next really destroyed my perception of reality. The Entity asked me "" If you worked at the insurance company, what was the name of the insurance company you worked for?"" I went to answer but i couldn't find the words, after a moment of thinking hard on it I replied "" I dont know"" The entity asked me if i could name a single coworker, and i couldn't, I couldn't even think of one co workers name and come to think of it, I couldn't remember my boss' name either. "" what the fuck"" i said out loud, I guess i am mentally ill. I reached into my pocket to find the number for the doctor. I pulled out the business card and when the entity saw me do it, it snapped its fingers and the card disappeared. "" You have a choice john"" The entity said, You can call the doctor and be hospitalized, or you can go back to typing, You can go back to work and everything can go back to normal. At first i thought the entity was crazy but the longer i thought about it, the more sense it made. i hugged the entity and it vanished. while it vanished the room changed. As i looked around the room i saw my office, my desk, surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. On my desk was a fresh mocha coffee with my name on it. I sat down and started working.After i finished the first stack. I grabbed my coffee and took a sip, what i expected to taste, and what i tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha but when i took a sip of my coffee, the coffee was caramel. ",2,1732841130.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1h29v9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1h29v9w/fishy_situation_at_uni_with_my_friend_idk_if_it/,"fishy situation at uni with my ""friend"". Idk if it fits ""bullying"" or i'm paranoid but it feels draining.","i started uni education 2 months ago and met a lot of people, suddenly falling into a friend group with students i have excercises/lectures with. Most of them live in the same dorm, so they kinda bonded with each other. One of them, that had put this group together is someone of a ""friend"" to me, but i don't trust her at all. She seemed pretty insecure when we first met, like she was apologising for everything and talking with sarcastic/joking manner about every subject. I remember we went out with her and my other friend, so she was mostly talking with her, forgetting that i exist too and when she remembered it was usually for some weird comments she thrown to the wind, like commenting the way i did something, or moved or anything, indicating that i must be stressed, when i wasn't at all. And i don't believe she made it with a good will, because she didn't just ask me personally, but smalltaked this shit out with this joking manner, while my other friend was watching.
After that hangout, she interacted with me many times and things suddenly didn't feel so fishy. Tbh i kinda liked her, because she introduced me to her other friends from her dorm and it felt less lonely. 

From yesterday i feel it kinda comes back tho. 
She started being borderline passive agressive just ""joking"" around and she had put me in uncomfortable situations twice. 
I have a close friend, who is the only person there that i could trust there and the ""friend"" tries hard for her to like her, even made a groupchat with 3 of us, when she's not interested in me so much, so why she just won't go and text with her instead af inviting me someore to be like the third wheel of a bike.
Everytime we met in 3 she was doing the same thing, maybe without stupid passive agression, but i still felt rejected afterwards. Recently she suggested that we should go to some party and asked me if we will take my close friend with us instead of just inviting her herself, so i felt kinda used and after i did that she was laughing that i didn't invite her on our stupid groupchat, like if it was my initiative.... She wrote me something afterwards that she's happy we're going there, but made it in a way that seemed ironic. 
I asked her, if it's an irony and she was again laughing and telling me she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I apologised, thinking that i misinterpreted shit and wrote ,,I'm tired and entering other densities"" to soothe the atmosphere, for which she wrote ,,i get it, just don't get too denseXDDDD"". Again i was pretending, that i'm amused. 

Today after lectures we went bowling with our other uni colleagues and i was kinda irritated by her, even if at the beggining i tried to go there with an open mind. She apologised me for some bullshit that nobody would be offended about and it seemed like she knew it doesn't make sense, more she did it in front of others, like if i needed her stupid apology. I laughed again. She was also pretty competitive when it comes to the play. 
Honestly I felt isolated when we were talking in a bigger group with her leading the conversation, cause i could just go away and they wouldn't notice. At the same time i had no idea how to join the conversation.

One time i snapped but still made it into a joke, when one guy from our major that was with us said to her, that it's her turn, when she was talking with someone and she jokingly said, that she's just a woman and he's stronger, so he should do it instead of her. I was standing next to her and started laughing hard asking loudly ,,Girl, what are you talking about, why?"". Something about her using the ""woman"" card to not take her turn instead of just saying she doesn't want it now really irritated me, but i had cope with laughter, so she started laughing to, even if for me it was just channeling my own agression, cause this whole situation wasn't even funny to me. 

Other thing is my ""friend"" wanted to go for a coffee with me couple weeks ago, but it didn't happen, because i got sick and we rescheduled it. I was happy, that she wanted to finally talk with me face to face instead of awkward group conversations and maybe i could just know why she acts like that and what is happening. But today she invited also my close friend there to go in 3...

I thought of cutting her off, cause i feel drained, but with her i would also cut off this people from her dorm and maybe my close friend too, because we all share this one big ""friend group"".

I usually just buy Stok because I enjoy cold brew more than hot coffee(I live in Florida). 

But it’s getting expensive now. I used to make my own cold brew, but never got it right and too much mess. 

So I’m looking for a Keurig. I have more counter space than fridge space. 

I do like the Brew+Chill. Because I like I can use it mainly for used coffee, using the special pods I’ve seen. 

But looking at the sub and online, I see mixed reviews. 

Is this worth getting as my first Keurig? My budget is $150 ish(currently on sale at Target for $170 plus I have $20 off). So if there is something else in that range that will be good for cold brew or iced coffee, I’m game for that. 

I won’t use the hot feature too much. But do enjoy a nice hot coffee now and then. ",1,1732841066.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

Any doctor or anyone, please read my post I beg you. I am in severe mental agony and cannot procede further in this life.
I have lost my job and i am addicted to drugs now to numb the pain. Please help.

I am 99% convinced I have early age onset pancreatic cancer. No I am not joking.

symptoms started 2.5 months ago, it started after drinking 750ml of wine but prior to it i was already having bloating/constipation 

My symptoms as follows:
- Fatty greasy stools that float 
- excessive bowel movements/tenesmus (6-7x a day)
- excessive gas
- bloating after eating high carbs/fructose/fat
- light colored stools (sometimes not greasy but just light in color)
-Nausea especially after coffee
- Malabsorption issues
- No diarrhea, No pain at all.
- loose stools
- sand/crumbling stools (look like actual sand)
- weight loss 50kg (109lbs to 105lbs) 47.5kg
-no muscle loss.
-urine is clear but i'm urinating a lot
- stress makes symptoms 10x worse, when i have no stress i'm 70% better
- indigestion/heartburn all the time

stools are starting to sink and are going back in color but still have excessive bowel movements

Tests I've done:

Ultrasound: clear
billirubin/liver enzymes: clear
waiting on pancreatic enzymes but most likely clear

everywhere I look my symptoms are close to pancan. I'm 20 and do not want to die but i've already killed myself.

I'm begging for help, any help i'm so scared.

One of them is an Iraqi War vet with substantial skill and grit. His name is Skull Crusher. The other one is a nefarious loner known only as Johnny Murder. Once the reinforcements arrive, we will devise a plan for killing the tormenting monster.

At noon the next day the cavalry arrived. Skull Crusher (he asked to be referred to as “SC”) arrived in a surplus Hummer painted desert camo. Johnny Murder arrived on an old, straight-piped Harley Dyna. He asked to be called “Murder”. I have to say that both SC and Murder looked like a couple of bad hombres. 

SC wore fatigue pants and a camo wife-beater top. He was covered in patriotic tats and obviously works out a lot given how huge he is. I made the mistake of commenting on his build, then asking about his workout routine. SC said “Hell, I got nothing else to do all day besides sitting there and waiting for my parole hearing.” I asked when he was released from prison. He said that his parole hearing is scheduled for next year, but that when Murder told him what was up with this Sasquatch, he had Murder arrange for an “early release”, then he laughed. Then SC said “Don’t worry, though. As far as the marshals know, I am heading up to Wisconsin to settle an old score with my ex-Wife. They got no idea that I am in Georgia.” 

Then Murder walked up. He is tall and lean and wearing a long, black trench coat with the sign of Baphomet sewn into the back of his coat. He has long, black hair and his finger nails are painted black. I attempted to be cordial to my guest, saying “Hey, Murder, I want you to know that I appreciate you getting SC out of jail to help out on this job. Murder turned and looked at me, then paused for an awkwardly long moment. Finally, Murder said “I am Satan, and I am here to do the Devil’s work.” Then he continued unpacking the saddlebags on his bike. 

I decided to have a word with Roy. I found him in my recliner, drinking some of my top shelf, 18 year old, single malt scotch straight from the bottle, and watching The Weather Channel on my TV. When Roy saw me he said “Boy, look at that thar hot blond weather bunny on the TV! Have you ever seen sech a hot piece of ass? I’d stick my cock so far up her pussy that it would come out her mouth! A simultaneous fuckin and a blow job in one!! Heh heh heh...” 

I said “Roy, the guys are here. I met them. SC was in prison, and Murder busted him out to come here. Oh, and Murder thinks he is Satan.” Roy just kept watching the weather bunnies jiggle on TV and said “uh huh, yeah”. 

The television cut to commercials and Roy directed his attention to me. He said, “Look Son, we all make mistakes, even you do. So what if Skull Crusher got into a little scrape-up in a dive bar? He’s a good guy, I knowed his pappy. They is good people. He sure as hell did not kill anyone, at least not there.” 

I asked Roy what the story is on Johnny Murder.   Roy casualty said “Old Johnny is a Satanist, through and through. He ain’t one of them faggot Anton Lavey, Church of Satan, Satanists either. He is the real deal. Hell, I once  seen him conjure up old Lucifuge hisself right in his living room. It was some right wild shit.” 

Flustered, I said “Roy ... what the fuck?!? These 2 guys are trainwrecks! An escaped convict and a weird Satanist?!? How in the hell are THEY going to help us kill Bigfoot?!?”

Roy appeared to be growing impatient with me. He glared at me. Then he raised his right hand and pointed at me as he said “Those boys are exactly what we need. They is exactly what YOU need right now. Those fellers are distributors fer the meth I cook up and sell fer a pretty penny. They is loyal to me and will do whatever I tell them to do!” I pays ‘em damn well and I take care of ‘em. Jest trust me, son. Trust that yer old uncle Roy knows what he’s a’doin’.”

I responded, “Ok, Roy. You know I trust you and your judgment. If you think we need these particular guys, then I am all in with ya.” Roy nodded curtly in approval, then told me to call the boys into the house for a sit-down meeting. 

The four of us sat around my kitchen table. Roy did most of the talking. He started out by thanking Skull Crusher and Murder for coming. He said “Fellers, this here be my nephew. Like his old Uncle Roy, Bud likes to dabble in Bigfooting. During the course of said dabbling, Bud here inadvertently turned on a huge gay Bigfoot that is aching to rape him with a massive hairy woody. Now, I dun seen this here critter’s pecker, mind ya. No man could survive a thumpin’ from this beast. His goddamn schlong is about 40” long when stiff, and big around as a paint can. So, ya see, if this homo foot gets hold of Bud, then old Bud is a goner.”

Skull Crusher spoke up. He asked “What happened to cause this animal to get so riled up?” I spoke up and said “I made a mistake. I was gifting with a clan of Sasquatch and then, I just fucked up and provoked it.” 

Roy interrupted and bluntly said, “Old Bud here decided to whip out his pecker and jerk off right in the middle of the goddamn woods, then he dropped his load right smack dab in the spot where the Bigfoots had been leaving gifts fer him.” 

At hearing this, Skull Crusher did a facepalm and Mr. Murder looked down as he shook his head from side to side. I tried to explain myself, but Roy shut me down, saying “Look, son, the past is the past. You dun fucked up, and now that critter is a’comin fer ya.” 

Roy continued, “Ya see, my wingnut nephew here has got a problem keeping his dick in his pants. Jest last night I seen him jacking off in this here kitchen, and then watched him putting the fuck-moves on his neighbor lady. Hell, Bud’s raging labido got that poor woman kilt last night!” 

Again I interjected, “No, you shooting her in the head is what got her killed.” I looked around at the others and said “Roy shot Mrs. Jenkins in the head, TWICE!!”

Roy then unloaded his side of the story, and I told mine. At the conclusion it was clear that the others believed that I was totally at fault for the Sasquatch and both homicides. Murder said “Dude, you do not try to fuck a bitch while your uncle is outside with just a couple of pistols trying to kill a dangerous animal... an animal YOU brought here!” Skull Crusher chimes in, “Bud, old Roy saved your life. It’s unfortunate that this Jenkins woman had to die but, you know, hindsight is 20/20.” Roy then repeated the last part, saying “Hindsight is 20/20.” 

Obviously, I was surrounded in my own house by mental patients. But what else could I do? I decided that I better listen to them. Seeing the need to move forward, Roy said “Ok, ok, we now all know that Bud is a degenerate sex freak. But that don’t mean I want to see my kin raped to death by a gorilla. We need to devise us up a plan to murder that Bigfoot, and fast! That thing will most likely be back tonight!” 

Roy continued, “Ok, now listen up, this here’s the plan. That big old bastard ape likes to stand just off Bud’s back patio at night, jest outa the light, and jack it while he watches Bud through the window. Tonight, we is gonna triangulate on this here Bigfoot. Johnny, you is gonna be on the roof with that .50 cal. Skull Crusher, you and me is gonna be in the trees out a bit from the patio with our fiddy cals and grenades.” 

Alarmed, I spoke up. “Grenades?!? What the fuck?!? You’ll blow up my house!!!” Roy looked at me and made a dismissive gesture with his hand. “You got insurance”, Roy said. I protested, saying “It won’t cover jack-shit if I am throwing grenades around my house!!”

At this point Murder stood up and said “Fuck this pussy! Let that critter rape the ungrateful bastard. C’mon, Skull, let’s get out of here.” Both Murder and Skull Crusher stood up like they were walking out. Roy held up his hands and said, “Whoa now, boys. You ain’t goin nowhar. Sit yer sorry asses down.” They both complied. Then Roy turned his scorn on me.

Roy said, “Now, boy, I am jest going to say this once. I am in charge here. If’n you ain’t gonna be a team player in this here endeavor then the three of us can jest pack our shit and leave it to ya. Understand? This here house ain’t gonna do you any good if’n you dead.” 

I nodded. Then Roy said “No more Bullshit! You do as I say. You hear?” I said “Yes Sir”. Roy responded “You Goddamn right, Yessir!!” Then he pulled off his hillbilly hat and hit me over the head with it.

Roy continued on with the plan. Murder, you is up on the roof top. Skull, you and I is high up in the trees with our rifles and grenades. 

Skull Crusher asked how high up in the tree he had to be. Roy told him at least 30 feet up. Skull said “Goddamn, Roy! How big is this thing?” Roy told him that by his estimate this Bigfoot is around 18 feet tall. Murder and Skull looked at each other with wide eyes. 

Then Skull said “Uh, Roy, we may have a problem.” Roy asked him what he meant. Skull looked a little uneasy and then sheepishly said “Uh, I’m scared of heights.” Roy paused then asked “What?”. Skull Crusher repeated that he is scared of heights. 

Before our meeting I had brewed us some coffee. I had a cup. I gave Skull and Murder both cups of coffee, as well as a cup for Roy. Of course, Murder pulled out a flask of what I assumed to be liquor and spiked his and Skull’s coffee. They passed the flask to Roy. Old Roy just dumped all his coffee out on my kitchen floor and dumped the remainder of the flask in his coffee cup. 

Uncle Roy seemed a bit perturbed at Skull Crusher and his revelation that he is scared of heights. As Roy started shaking his head and muttering “Goddamn it” under his breath, Skull said “It ain’t my fault, Roy. It’s a phobia.” That drove Roy over the edge. 

Roy snatched his coffee cup and slung it at Skull Crusher. The cup shattered against Skull Crusher’s head. Then Roy stood up and flew into a rage. Skull grabbed his head in pain as blood rolled down his face. Roy started screaming at Skull Crusher, “You goddamn little f*ggot pussy!!! SCARED OF HEIGHTS?!?! You WILL be scared of heights when I put my boot up yer worthless ass. I’ll kick your ass right up that thar tree, you pathetic worm!!! NOW YOU IS GONNA MAN-UP AND SHIMMY RIGHT UP THAT GODDAMN TREE LIKE I AM OR I WILL RIP OFF THAT EMPTY HEAD OF YOURS AND SKULL FUCK YOU!!!! GOT IT?!?”

Skull Crusher sheepishly nodded yes. Roy said “Scared of heights... that’s the goddamn dumbest thang I ever dun did hear. What are you, a fairy?” Skull responded, “No sir.” Then Roy glared at Skull and called him a “cunt”. 

Unfortunately, Roy was not yet done. He continued, “I’m glad I don’t pay no goddamn taxes. If’n I did then I would be right pissed to know that I wuz paying a sissy like you to go over there to Afghanistan to kick them Muslim rag-heads’ asses.” 

Poor old Skull Crusher was obviously not used to being spoken to in such a manner. He then stupidly said to Roy “There ain’t no trees in Afghanistan.” Roy immediately grabbed my coffee cup to hurl at Skull Crusher. I grabbed Roy’s arm to stop him from hitting Skull again and then pleaded with Roy, “Roy! Don’t!! He said he would climb the tree. It’s ok, He’s going to do it!!”

Roy finally calmed down and composed himself. He then resumed with the plan. Roy said “OK. So Murder is on the roof, over the patio. Skull and me are in the trees, THIRTY FEET UP (Roy glared at Skull Crusher as he said this), and we are armed with our fiddy cals and throwin’ grenades.”

Roy then turned his attention to me. “Bud, you is gonna be the bait again, seein’ as how this here critter has got the hots fer ya. This here is what you is a’gonna do. You is gonna drag this here kitchen table over to those sliding winder doors so this Bigfoot will have a good view of ya. Then, you is a’gonna drop your drawers and bend over the table, with yer ass pointing to the window so the that horny Sasquatch will get hisself a ragin boner. Basically, you is gonna set yerself up like you is a wantin an ass-bangin.” 

At this point I had no will to to object to anything Roy said. I just nodded yes. Roy saw my concern, but seemed to respect my compliance, so he said “Don’t worry now, son. We will be right outside.”

Roy explained that the horny Bigfoot will probably be agitated after last night’s encounter. But with my bare ass sticking up at the glass sliding doors, the creature will see it then get all distracted by its horniness, causing it to drop its guard and approach. The goal, Roy explained, was to lure it into the kill box so that the three of them on the outside of the house will each have close-range shots will their .50 cal rifles. 

Roy said to me “Now, Bud, I want you wiggling that ass. Shake it. Slap it. Finger yer self. You got to get the animal turned on.” I heard snickering and looked up to see both Skull Crusher and Murder trying unsuccessfully to conceal their giggling. 

Roy asked “Any questions?” We all said no. Then Roy said “One More thang. Bud, this here is fer you”, then he pulled something out of his pocket and handed it to me. It was a tube of K-Y jelly, a lubricant. Both Skull Crusher and Murder started laughing hysterically. Roy said “Don’t mind these boys. If somethang goes wrong and that beast gets to ya, well, it will be best If’n you are lubed up really well.” 

Night came. Roy and Skull Crusher climbed into position up their trees, and Murder was on the roof. At exactly 6:00 pm I was to enter the kitchen, do a strip tease, then assume the wanton position, bare assed and bent over the kitchen table. I figured I would lube myself up while in position, as sort of an erotic prelude used to attract the Sasquatch. 

6:00 pm came and I assumed the position. I did everything Roy told me to do. I felt like a total homo, but I knew it was my job as bait. I applied the lube, seductively, shook my ass, and even did finger stuff. I felt ridiculous. I started wondering how long I would have to keep this up. It already started to feel like a fucking eternity. Frankly, it is rather uncomfortable to reach around to finger one’s own anus. But I kept at it. Wondering how long this could possibly go on, I glanced at the clock on my wall. It was 6:09 pm. Goddamn it!!

All four of us had Bluetooth headsets on so we could communicate. After a few more minutes Roy spoke to me over the head set, saying “Bud, I will tell you when I hear the Sasquatch approaching. When I give the word you start wiggling your ass and fangering yerself.” I replied, “Roy, I have already been doing it for the past 20 minutes, just like you said.” Roy said “Goddamn, Boy, you is one degenerate pervert, aren’t ya?” Then Murder chimed in and called me a “f*g”.

Shortly afterward I heard from Roy again. “He’s here, approaching from the south, approaching my position from the rear. Get to the finger-fucking, Bud. Here he comes!! Murder, Skull, you copy?” Murder and Skull checked in and were both locked and loaded. 

But the beast did not approach. After several minutes Roy said “Somethang is wrong. That sumbitch took up position behind me. He is not approaching. I don’t think it can even see Bud in its position.” I asked Roy if he is sure it was our target. Roy replied, “Hell Yeah, I’m sure. I saw it’s silhouette and heard its footsteps. I can feel it’s footsteps up here in the tree, that thing is HUGE!” 

For whatever reason, the animal was not approaching, and it was not even close to the kill box. Maybe it caught the boys’ scent, I am not sure. 

Then Roy called me. He said, “Boy, I hate to do this, but you is gonna have to come outside. It caint see ya from its position. Turn on your porch light and come outside so it can see you. Oh, and chub up first. I want ya to come out to the patio and jack-off in the light. That will surely draw the monster into the kill box!” 

I knew there was no point in objecting, so I did as Roy commanded. At this point in my life I can pretty much just will myself to produce an erection. I just hold my breath, squeeze my fists, and push. BAMMO!! There it is!! 

I walked out onto the patio, which cock at full mast. I walked out into the light and put my left leg up on a chair in a kind of Captain Morgan pose, bare ass naked, and started stroking my prick. I heard Skull Crusher over my head-set say “Goddamn, Bud is hung like a horse!” 

Then I decided to improvise. I started pumping my hips to thrust my wang through my hand and saying shit out loud like “Oh yeah, look at this big cock! I wish I had someone to help me handle this meat!” Roy spoke to me through my head set, saying “You is doing great Boy!! Let it all hang out!!” 

I have a metal table sitting on my patio. I use it for holding my grill and smoker tools, and to set my shit on when I am sitting out there smoking cigars. I said “Look at this, big boy”, and started banging my dong on that metal table. It made a hell of a racket! If that Bigfoot had not noticed me yet, it had now. Then I started drumming the table with my boner. I was drumming the opening drum sequence from Van Halen’s “Hot For Teacher” with my cock when all of a sudden came this ungodly roar! 

It was the Bigfoot!! The roar was deep and loud. I could feel it in my chest. It was like the roar from an African buck lion, but times 10. It was like the Sasquatch was standing right there on the patio with me, even though it was a good 100 or so yards away in the woods behind my house. 

Then came the unmistakable sound of footsteps. They were fucking loud, and you could feel the earth trembling at the beast’s weight. It was coming!! A voice came over my head-set. It was Roy telling me to get back in the house. I retreated into the house, sitting down in a chair in front of my glass sliding door, cock proudly standing at attention like a flagpole. My right hand was behind my back so the approaching beast could not see that I was holding my Ruger .480 revolver. 

The bastard had a clear view of me as it walked toward my house, looking out through the window I began to see trees swaying. I surmised that the trees were being pushed to the side by the approaching giant. Even in the house I could hear, and feel, it’s footsteps. I heard “FOOF! FOOF! FOOF! FOOF!!”. It was getting closer and closer. I heard Roy say “Here it comes. Hold yer fire until it gits into the kill box. I’ll give the word.” 

Then I saw it. It was HUGE!!! 18’ tall is conservative. It was as big around as a pickup truck. It’s eyes glowed a fiery red, and it’s hands were are big as a La-Z-Boy recliner! And, yes, it had a hard-on. It was just as big as Roy said. It was huge, throbbing, and glowing red. In fact, you could actually SEE the pulsating caused by every heartbeat of this animal. 

The monstrous ape saw me sitting there, just inside the sliding glass door, naked and hard. It stopped, then gingerly moved forward. I am scared fucking senseless at this point, waiting for the shooting to start. The monster knelt down onto my patio so that it could gaze at me through the glass. It’s fucking head was as big as a VW Bug, and it’s eyes were solid black and the size of beach balls. 

The thing was as hairy as a Mexican woman, and it smelled just as bad. As it knelt down to look at me, it seemed to exhibit a certain degree of intelligence and self-awareness. Though absolutely scared stiff, I was curious. What was this animal seeing? What was it thinking. And for the love of God, why wasn’t anyone shooting?!?

Staring at the Bigfoot, something unexpected happened. It smiled at me. It was not malevolent in any way. It was a kind smile. Dare I say, it was a loving smile. Maybe this was about more than rape. Maybe this thing really did have a crush on me! 

The beast then slowly brought around its right hand and held out a rose bush that appears to have been pulled out of the ground. The Sasquatch was actually giving me roses!!! I could not believe it!!! This was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for old Bud! I could not help but smile. I was flattered! I looked up into those big black eyes and looked at them through my misty eyes. The communication was unspoken: I loved the flowers and was opening my heart to this big beast. 

I still do not understand exactly what happened to me in that moment. Perhaps I was influenced by infrasound produced by the animal and it’s gigantic, throbbing fuck-stick. Or maybe I was genuinely smitten. I was not myself, I can tell you that for a fact. Suddenly, my gaze turned to the monsters throbbing Member. 

Then all hell broke loose! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!!! The hellish reports from those .50 BMGs were deafening!! The beast stood up immediately. It was so tall I could not really see what it was doing. I flipped the kitchen table on its side and took up a defensive position behind it, raising my pistol hand and readying for combat. 

Something flies past the window and splatters onto my patio. It was Murder!! Given the amount of blood that spewed out of him he was dead. Then comes another thud. I call out for Roy on my head-set. “ROY!! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON OUT THERE?!?!” Roy Shot back “Murder is dead. So is Skull Crusher.”

Then Roy asked “You got that .480 on ya, boy?” I said I did. Roy said “Well, things ain’t going so well out here. You may want to just go ahead and bow out, son.” I asked, “What?!?”. Roy said, “Just eat a bullet, son. Trust me, it will be far better than how you will die If’n this here monster gits a’holda ya.” I then hear a volley of .50 BMG gunfire from outside. I said to myself “Fuck this!”, and storm outside. 

Murder’s body is cut in half and splattered all over my patio. Blood and guts are everywhere. Skull Crusher’s lifeless body is hanging upside down from a high tree limb. His safety strap got tangled around his ankle, and that is what’s holding him up in the tree. Then I see Roy, standing up on a high tree limb, like a monkey, holding his .50 cal at his hip with one arm and feeding it ammo from a belt with the other arm. He is firing like Rambo! BAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!!!

The Bigfoot is swatting at Roy, but cannot quite reach him. It wants to knock over the tree so it can get to Roy, but every time it tries Roy pops it with his .50 cal. This is making the monster very agitated. 

I screamed at the monster as loud as I could. It turned and saw me standing there. As soon as I had its attention I turned and dropped to my knees, as if to say “come on in”. Well, that pushed the old gay ape over the edge. It dropped to its knees, looking at me. Roy saw what was going on and stopped firing. 

Then the ape made its first mistake. It puckered up its lips, closed it’s eyes, and moved in toward me. Clearly, it wanted a kiss. “How fucking pathetic is THIS?”, I thought. 

It got its face right up next to mine. Then I said “Hey, bitch, look at this.” When it opened it’s eyes, I could see my reflection in its left eye. It was me pointing my .480 at the monster. BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!!! I unloaded the large bore revolver into the beast’s eye! 

It recoiled in horror, crying out in pain. I heard Roy on my head-set say “Bud, grenades...”, so I leapt up and fled. But just then 2 explosions let loose, close together, BAM-BAM!!! The conclusion blew me off my feet. I went flying, but landed ok. I immediately heard, through the ringing in my ears, Roy’s .50 BMG rattling off more shots. 

I turned around and saw that the big old Bigfoot was blown to pieces. Half of its fucking face was gone. Roy was pumping it full of lead, with each bullet causing an explosion of blood and bloody flesh every time they struck. Nonetheless, the behemoth fought on. 

Then I caught a glimpse of something. It was Mr. Murder’s .50 BMG Barrett. I pick it up and check the mag, 10 shots in the mag. I thought to myself “WTF?!? Murder never even fired his weapon!!” But I would have to reflect on this later. I sprinted into action.

As the Sasquatch has all of its focus on Roy, I sneak up behind it, positioned the rifle’s muzzle right up the thing’s asshole and pulled the trigger 3 times in quick succession. BAM! BAM! BAM!!  The animal grabbed its ass with both hands and went down to its knees. It was howling in pain. 

I flanked the animal and got in front of it. It was in such pain it did not even notice me. Then I take aim on the Bigfoot’s balls. BAM!! They explode like oversized watermelons. Then, just for the fuck of it, I took aim and blew off its dick. Blood spurted from the remaining stump like a fire hose!!

Now the animal was moaning and it’s eyes were rolling up in its head. I took aim and fired the remaining cartridges into the animals head. Clearly, the bullets penetrated the thick skull, as bloody brain matter was blasted out of its head every time I shot. The .50 cal absolutely shredded its brain. Then, with a loud thud, the beast fell over, deader than a Kennedy!

Roy climbed down the tree and came up running. “Goddamn it, boy!! You dun did it!!! You kilt that fuckin critter!!! I softened it up a might, but you stepped it up like a man and MURDERED that motherfucker!!! Damn, Son, that is the biggest damn Bigfoot critter I ever dun see!!” Clearly, Roy was excited. 

Roy said, “Let’s git us a drank, boy! You earned it! Oh, and put on some goddamn clothes already.” As we are walking toward the house I catch sight of something. I tell Roy to go on ahead and pour me a drink, that I will be there in a moment. So he goes on ahead. 

I walk over to the object I spied. As I thought, it was Skull Crusher’s BARRETT .50 BMG rifle. I released the magazine and took a look. 10 rounds were present. This means that, just like with Mr. Murder, Skull Crusher’s rifle was never fired. I carried the rifle to my back door, leaned it up against the door frame and entered my house. 

I found Roy standing behind my bar in my living room, pouring drinks. He looks up with me with a smile. Then he asks “Damn, boy, you had a hard dick all this time? Jesus Christ!Cover that thang up!!”

I walked up to the bar, took my glass of scotch, and took a sip. Then I asked Roy what happened out there. Roy said, “Look, son, I ain’t gonna tell you again, go put on some pants and quit prancing around here like a f*ggot”. Roy had a point, so I went and got dressed. 

When I returned, Roy was sitting by the fire sipping whiskey. He looked at me and smiled, all snaggle toothed. He said “There’s my boy!!” I picked up my scotch and sat down next to Roy. 

I again asked him what happened out there. Roy said “What happent? What happent is that you dun went and killed a record Sasquatch!!” I said “NO. WHAT HAPPENED? I checked Murder’s and Skull’s rifles and no shots were fired. WHY DIDN’T YOU GIVE THE ORDER TO SHOOT?!?” 

Roy takes out his pipe, stuffs it, tamps it, then lights it. I know what he is doing. First, he is collecting his thoughts as he prepares his pipe. Second, he is getting ready to tell me something. I decided to let him take his time telling me.

After a couple puffs on his pipe, Roy began. “Son, sometimes we do thangs in life fer many purposes. For example, when I seen how big this sumbitch Bigfoot was, I knew I needed my old fiddy-cal shootin iron. But I left it up in Sasquatch Hollar. So I needed someone to retrieve it fer me. So I called up old Johnny Murder.”

“Johnny sed he would, but he wuz a’busy bustin old Skull Crusher outa the pokey. I told him, hell, bring him along wit ya. Nobody will think to look fer him down here in Georgia.” 

“Ya see, boy, old Skull Crusher got hisself inta sum trouble. I knowed that DA wuz a’gonna dangle reduced sentence deals in front of his dumb ass if he agreed to spill his guts about my liquor and meth operations. This put old Roy in a spot.” 

“Now, I doubt Skull Crusher would have turned on me, but why take a chance? So I up and ordered Johnny Murder to bust him outa prison and bring him to me. That wuz right before Thanksgiving. Then all this drama with yer Bigfoot came up. I figured, why not kill 2 birds with one rifle?” 

“I got them 2 sumbitches down here under the guise of hunting down and killing this critter. I needed my fiddy, mind you. But I needed those assholes here too. I had to tie up loose ends.”

So while we wuz on point, and those 2 boys were distracted by that thar Bigfoot, I shot old Skull Crusher in the head, then I shot Johnny Murder in the head cuz he wuz a witness.”

Old Roy was smiling as he told me this, like he was really pleased with himself for what he did. I said “Goddamn, Roy, I was almost fucking killed and you were distracted by business.” Roy said “Yeah, but I wuz here fer ya, weren’t I? If’n I tweren’t out thar blasting away at that critter then you never would have been able to move in and kill it!” 

Roy had a point. I said, “You were here for me Roy, and I appreciate it. I really do.” Roy nodded. I said “Well, I guess we need to get rid of a couple more bodies. You want to gut and carve up the Bigfoot for meat?” Roy said, “Hell yeah!! I’ll eat off that big thang fer the winter.” He asked if I wanted some of the meat, and I said no. 

I look over at Roy and say, “I love you, Uncle Roy.” Roy looked at me and replied, “Don’t be a f*g, son.”  ",1,1732840646.0,Sasquatch_Nazi,0,1.0,False

As I sit here, hunched over my notebook at the Gourmet Cafe, the clock shows 9:00 minutes into the third quarter of the Cowboys vs. Giants game. The air is thick with a palpable tension that mirrors the on-screen battle unfolding before me. The sharp aroma of freshly brewed coffee mixes with the sweetness of pastries, but my taste buds are dulled by a lingering sadness. I glance around at the unfamiliar faces, each absorbed in their own conversations, drawing circles of camaraderie I can't penetrate. It was during these quiet moments, I miss a familiar face—like Tim Muller. I can almost hear his laughter from our childhood escapades at Corn Lynn Creek, where our reckless bike ride turned into the stuff of legend. The memory of his father’s panic still resonates; the image of him throwing the bike into the creek, his face a mix of anger and worry, while bearing the weight of his stage 4 cancer, is a powerful reminder of life’s fragility.

Yet as the game progresses, the tension that initially wrapped around me like a heavy blanket begins to lift. The familiar rhythm of sports commentary fills the air, grounding me. I chuckle softly as I think of those nights back home, sprawled on the couch with my brother, our eyes glued to the TV as Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds forged their legendary partnership in the 2004-2005 cricket series. The excitement of that makeshift team in our living room, fueled by soda and nachos, creates an invisible thread connecting past to present. The cheers and groans from my fellow patrons at the cafe pull me back into the moment, the energy infectious. I can feel the warmth of camaraderie and rivalry, my heart racing with each thrilling play. This game, like that cricket series, is more than just a competition; it’s a moment of bonding, shared hope, and the simple joy of being part of something larger than myself. The unfamiliar withers as the Cowboys and Giants reignite that old sense of connection, a reminder that even in solitude, I am never truly alone. My brother was more into cricket than me but.

This year our children are in the same class (our school has two classes for each year group) and she seemed to ramp up the friendship, always asking to hang out, asking to come to my home before school pick up (sometimes from 1pm) or if we could hang out weekday evenings, I of course would say no sometimes as I would be busy or not have the energy for it. It started to get suffocating, and what really made me decide to say something was when recently I had told her during morning school run I was planning to deep clean the house so would see her at the afternoon school pickup, well I got a knock on the door at 12:30, I answered it thinking it was my package.. it was her, that night I text her that I would appreciate a message to check she could come over as I was busy. She seemed to ignore this and cling more, so the last few days I have distanced, dropped my kids off and just walked on home. However she confronted me about it saying “have I upset you? Or are you just weird?” So I reiterated again I just need some time to myself, how we don’t need to do everything together, yet somehow this has again been ignored and she has messaged me tonight asking if I want to go out drinking on weekend, at this point I feel like I’m an AH because I’ve stated multiple times I need some time away from the friendship and it’s being ignored, I don’t want to stop being her friend, I just want to have time to myself. I probably should have set boundaries sooner but i stupidly thought it would be a mum I could occasionally meet for coffee and have a chat with, but obviously not.

 [EDIT: it's a weird relationship we have with him. one day he's god awful and I don't even leave my room and the next he's acting like im his best friend on the whole planet. it's weird and conflicting especially since it feels he's taken over our house even tho we're letting him crash with us (and have been for 2 years without asking more than he pays some of the rent). but he's still a good friend... it's so confusing. and he is also friends with Sue but not so much these days as they don't talk too much so i don't know what to do]

my partner and I have been incredibly anxious about parting with the kittens because we've grown so attached and have them all named but obviously realise that we cannot keep them and that we will never have kittens again as our mama cat is being spayed asap. i've cried so much over the thought of them leaving and it utterly shattered my heart to think that i would never see them again. 

I don't want to fall out with Tom as he's a good friend despite how much he has taken advantage of my partner and i, but we would both just feel so much happier and less anxious and more comfortable and honestly (selfish or not) would bring me less grief if the kitten we've grown so attached to went to our friend Sue's house rather than to Tom's bother... but does doing that make me a massive poohead? :/",1,1732839679.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

1h29gg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1h29gg8/first_time_flying_a_sign/,First time flying a sign,"So, inspired by my incredible lack of any money, the temp steadily getting colder, being almost out of cigs, having not cleaned myself or my clothes in weeks and the panhandling guide I came across on this board, I went ahead and gave it a try. Yeah I never wanted to beg for money, but somehow, I don't think anyone has ever had that as an aspiration. It's about survival until I can get working and there's really no shame in that. Also, my library was closed today and I had no place to just ""be"", and no library coffee. 

I expected to maybe scrounge up $30 in a bunch of hours, but really had no idea what to expect. The panhandling guide person said they had a goal of $100 a day and usually hit it. Wow. I know it's Thanksgiving but holy hell I did not expect this unrelenting wave on generosity. In about 6 hours of off and on sign-flying while taking a warm up and smoke break every hour or so, I made $189. Not only that but people would NOT stop giving me ridiculous amounts of food.

One couple brought me a whole dozen donuts they had just bought. Some sweet old lady went to the store and bought me a damn giant bag of groceries. Fruits, snacks, 2 giant deli sandwiches, a half gallon of milk, just like, more than I could eat in a week. Her alone. A car pulled up with a bunch of little girls in the back and they gave me friggin hot wings and a huge box of crackers, ham and cheese wedges. Sooo much food. Way too much food. 

I gave away as much as people would take around the nearby gas station, but not many are super stoked to take food from a dumpy looking homeless dude with a bunch of bags. The guide told me not to turn anything down and I didn't, but it was just way too much. 

The irony is, while I have been going hungry some nights and primarily fishing through dumpsters, I have a gallbladder that isn't doing so great at the moment, so eating too much food or the wrong kind of food can be very bad for me. Like hours and hours of pain bad. Welp I definitely ate too much and now I'm going through just that. Hell, a lady bought me some super micchicken from McDonald's with a $20 in the bag. Like goddamn.

Idk, I just wanted to share that. I was almost brought to tears several times today. I didn't even know the general public was capable of being this overwhelmingly generous. I got a $20 bill from 5 different people today. Hell I almost had enough at the end of it to get a motel room, but my fuggin bank account doesn't exist anymore and paying in cash would mean a $100 deposit and I was $12 off from spending every dollar I made on a room for one damn night, though I supposedly would've gotten the deposit back. 

Idk wow, just wow. If you are homeless and you've been to proud to try this, I encourage you to do so. Again, I know it's Thanksgiving so people are going to be more generous today than usual, but if you need money you need money and if they want to give it to you let them. Being homeless is expensive.

I tend to feel more comfortable around family because I don’t get as strong of anxiety from them. But later that day I grabbed deviled eggs out of the fridge and offered them to people.

I've (35F)  been with my partner (40M)  for 13 years. We have 2 small kids (4 and 3). He works full time, i work part time and parent full time. We've had our ups and downs over the years -more downs than ups lately- but generally we're really good friends, understand each other and have a good time together. 

But recently I've developed feelings that are causing me A LOT of confusion.

When I was pregnant with our second, I met a mum at the library. We'd chat politely when we'd see each other there, but no friendship really came of it and I stopped going when my baby was about 3 months old.

So 9 months later in March this year I started up at a new gym, and my first day going, I ran into her. I continued to run into her repeatedly until I eventually said clearly the universe wants us to be friends, let's have coffee. We caught up and a really nice friendship started to form over the last 7 months.

I'm slowly but surely starting to develop really strong feelings for her, which is confusing on so many levels. I've always been attracted to women but I've never developed feelings for one. She's all I think about all the time. She is so cute and funny and quirky and I just feel the best I've felt in years when I'm with her. 

I'm not stupid and realise that alot of these i feelings are probably being caused and amplified by the fact I'm not really happy in my relationship with my partner. But how much is caused by unhappiness and how much is genuine?

My libido for 2 years has been completely diminished. I'm completely touched out, overstimulated and just plan exhausted from parenting that the idea of sex makes me cringe. But lately even my libido is starting to come back, but only when I think of being intimate with women/her. 

I would never cheat on my partner, i have too much respect for him and i really do love him. I don't want to have an affair with this woman, I actually really think I could grow to love her. I know that she probably doesn't feel the same way about me which is fine, shes married with kids too and i would never put her in an awkward position like that. But this situation is making me question my entire identity and sexuality. If I was a few years younger and didnt have any kids this wouldnt be as much of a dilemma, but I'm not the only person that I have to think of in this situation. I have a lot to lose and I don't want to ruin my kids lives. 

What do I do?
He won't do therapy, and opening up to him about my feelings isn't an option. He is extremely jealous and generally quite homophobic, 2 traits that ive always hated but learned to tolerate.

Karma is Reddit’s way of showing how much you’ve contributed to the community. Think of it as a social score that reflects how other users perceive your posts and comments. When you receive **Upvotes**, your Karma increases, and when you receive **Downvotes**, it decreases.

**What’s the Point of Karma?**

While Karma doesn’t directly give you any tangible rewards (sorry, no free coffee or gift cards), it does serve several purposes:

1. **Building Trust**

A high Karma score shows that you’ve been an active, valuable member of the community. It’s like saying, “Hey, I’m not just here to spam or troll.”

2. **Accessing Communities**

Some subreddits require a minimum Karma score to post or comment. This helps keep out spammers and ensures that contributors have a history of positive engagement.

3. **Social Proof**

On Reddit, Karma is like a badge of honor. A high score can feel like recognition for the memes, advice, or discussions you’ve contributed.

4. **Fun and Pride**

For some, Karma is simply a fun goal to chase. Watching your Karma rise can feel oddly satisfying—it’s like leveling up in the game of Reddit.

5. **No Real-World Value**

Despite what it may seem, Karma doesn’t have any monetary or practical value outside Reddit. It’s purely a measure of your Reddit activity.

**Why Do People Care About Karma?**

The truth is, Karma doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. But in the world of Reddit, it’s a sign that you’re doing something right. Whether you’re crafting hilarious memes or sharing heartfelt advice, it’s nice to know your efforts are appreciated by the community.

So, while Karma might not pay the bills, it’s a fun and rewarding aspect of Reddit culture. Happy posting, and may the upvotes be ever in your favor! 🚀",1,1732838974.0,zuQBox,0,1.0,False

1h296dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h296dt/i_m20_have_feelings_for_one_of_my_best_friends_f23/,I (M20) have feelings for one of my best friends (F23),"So little context, we met a year ago in front of a bar, I asked her to join us to a different bar and she went with it. 

We continued to meet up regularly every week as a friend group and I started having feelings for her that I never acted on because I never knew if she was taken or not. 

Fast forward 8 months, she broke up with her boyfriend whom I only found out she had after 6 months of knowing her. 

I still had feelings for her but decided to give her time because I was still unsure if she had any for me or just wanted a friendship. 

Fast forward a month ago and she starts working at the same place I do as a bartender. In between her starting to work with me and our last meet up was also sort of radio silence, just exchanging snaps daily. 

We had a shift together on thursday and she went home earlier as there was nothing going on that day but she stayed around and was drinking with our colleagues. 

The entire shift even before drinking she was touchy and hugged me a couple of times and I liked it. 

Towards the end of the shift I was super tired and my roommate who also knows her came around with his girlfriend and they were making comments to me how she's into me and I should make a move. 

Bear in mind, I was awake for 24h at that time since I can't sleep from time to time and that was just one of those days. 

I finished up work and since I drove to work, I offered to take them all home and she asked me if I could take them home first then her. I said sure and we made ourselves on our way to my car. The entire way there she was hugging me and looking at me with puppy eyes and since I liked her too, I took those as signals and we were walking hand in hand. 

Once I dropped my roommate back at our place, I drove her home where we sat for a few minutes in my car just vibing to music. Once it stopped, she gave me the look again and I went in for the kiss. We made out in my car for around 20 or so minutes. After that, we had a smoke, made out some more and I went back home. 

The next day I asked her if we could talk and she said to come around to her place, we didn't end up doing much talking but rather just cuddled and watched a movie. I tried to not be the pushy kind of guy, not wanting sex or anything, just genuienly enjoyed her company and the moment. She cuddled up to me and hugged me and we just spent the evening together. I went back home around 11pm. 

Once I was back home she wrote me that she really enjoyed the evening but didn't want to rush things as she was out of a relationship, she valued our friendship, didn't know at what point she was and didn't want to pull someone in (paraphrasing but hopefully you get the gist). I told her I understand her and am there for her. We also made plans for monday to go out on a date to the christmas market in our town and we went there where we talked some more about us. 

I told her I tought a lot about the message she wrote me and how I had feelings for her for a while and for me it was going into the direction of a relationship. I told her I don't want to rush things either and that we could take it slow and that I'm there for her. We also talked a lot about our past, our families and she talked a bit about her ex. 

After the christmas market I took her home where we talked some more and she asked me why I never made a move sooner to which I replied I didn't know whether she had a boyfriend or not. I told her I liked her a lot for who she is and told her I liked her eyes to which she replied that they're not that special. We talked some more and made out some more at which point I had to leave to catch the last train back home. 

The next day we had another shift together where she wasn't as physical as the last time around but she gave me a hug out of nowhere which was nice. I didn't try to push anything and since we were at our workplace, a kiss would've probably been inapropriate. 

After the shift, we went to catch the train, we said goodbyes and she looked at me again with those typical kiss me eyes which I did. 

The next day was more or less radio silence from her, I just texted her to see how she was doing. We talked a bit back and forth but nothing much. 

Same for today, I asked if we could meet up for a coffee to which she said yes but when we met, she was sort of cold and distant, no hello kiss or goodbye kiss when we parted ways. I asked her when will we see each other and she just said I don't know to which I said we will write to each other. 

Now, did I mess something up? I really like her and my roommate who is also my best friend for the last 6 years always made comments how we were closer to each other in our friend group. 

I don't know if anybody can make sense out of this, I want to give her space to figure out what she has to figure out but at the same time I want to know where we stand. I see this going towards a relationship from my side and I feel like there is no going back to the way it was before we kissed. 

I know I'm not the quickest at picking up signals or anything but man I've fallen for her more than I imagined. 

TL:DR: One of my best friends and I made out and spent a evening together as well as going on a date. Two days later she starts distancing herself from me.

1h2961a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1h2961a/thankful_list_20/,Thankful List 2.0,"When I was about 8 years old, I ran away from a less than stellar foster home and spent a few days living on the street in Chicagoland, sleeping in a park (weeping willows make natural tents.) I talked to myself a lot and came up with a sort of list of things that were good in my life at that point. 

It was a very short list. 

Walking around Sac today, with the trees aflame in fall colors, I was thinking about how different my life is now, some 30-odd years later.

* I have a two bedroom apartment to live in. It's about $2k a month, full of food, tech, and stuff I like. I can afford it myself.
* I've loved deeply and lost just as hard.
* I'm alive and all my limbs, senses, and mental faculties work as the society around me expects. My older brother was shot in 2002 and is a paraplegic. My younger brother died in 2020 in a wreck. Friends of mine since then have also died or suffered some permanent injury. This is easy to take for granted.
* There are people who care about me. Hard to see that, since I've been isolating for so long since becoming unexpectedly widowed and I moved away from everyone - but they do.
* I have a full time career with benefits at the director level and it's something I feel good about and resonates with my lived experience.
* I've been able to travel around the world: Singapore to Hanoi, Seoul, Greece, Paris, Chiapas, Tulum, Guadalajara, Xochimilco and more. Chicago, NYC, DC, SF, Sac and LA.
* I can write this list in two languages fluently.
* I've struggled with mental health issues and a truly prodigious amount of true trauma, but have gained tools and strategies to handle them, through therapy and insight. Through them I've also gained perspective and heightened empathy.
* I have a degree and am well read, educated, socially adept. I feel at ease both by myself or in groups of friends and/or strangers.
* I live in freedom (I've worked with people who do not).
* I'm a white passing Latino male. I have a deepening connection to my culture, but don't face the immediate prejudices or struggles others might for being obviously different.
* I can have another 40-50 years ahead of me. This is a little harder to see as a benefit because things feel so low right now but: portions of my life have been just as bad or worse before and it got better. It can and will again. 

It's just me this year (in many more ways than one), but sitting on a bench in Old Sac (that little alcove area with the big statue of Theodore Judah) made me remember that first list. It made me realize that I have a lot to be grateful for, despite my troubles. 

Mostly, I'm thankful for you, Sac. You guys have been pretty awesome. So I'll add this last one (for now):

* I live in a welcoming city. Total strangers from this subreddit and other local groups (or just out in the world) have been incredibly welcoming: a coffee trauma dump at Tupi, a Magic the Gathering game day at Elysium (and a ride to and from), a quiet hike, an invite to Concerts in the Park. People are nice here. I've been where they're not.

The walk to Materuni Waterfall offers a glimpse into the nature of Tanzania allowing you either to prepare your body for the forthcoming climb to Kilimanjaro or ease your muscles after the climb.

The tour starts with a walk to Materuni Waterfall. It is an opportunity to see how local fruit like avocados, mangos, lemons, and bananas grow, as well as learn some of the local history, traditions, village economy, agricultural and cultural life. When you get to the waterfall, you can refresh yourself in the natural pool, so swimsuits will come in handy!

The tour will continue with a visit to the local village lying in the coffee plantations. The villagers will demonstrate the process of coffee farming and guide you through the preparation of coffee from a bean to a cup. Sing and dance along with the Chaga people as they are grinding, roasting and boiling the beans. When the coffee is ready, villagers will serve lunch - a national Chagga meal.

I’m 34m who has been struggling with urethral burning for the past 9 months. It started after a sexual encounter. After speaking with an infectious disease specialist yesterday, he posed the idea of it being IC. His rationale is that it seems like there is no active infection after semen cultures and urine cultures, however I’m still struggling with my symptoms. I’ve been on many courses of abx and in one cases I was symptom free for up to 3 weeks. 

—————————

My symptoms include:

Urethral and pubic area burning (less common)

Frequency but not all the time 

Burning when I have to pee but not all the time

Leakage


—————————

My triggers include:

Ejaculation

Holding in pee

—————————

As far as I can tell coffee, alcohol or spicy foods aren’t triggers as I’ve had coffee and alcohol before and have good days. I’ve regrettably had a cystoscopy which didn’t call out bladder inflammation just inflammation of the urethral mucosa. I’ve also had ultrasounds of my bladder and it seemed to void completely, and also a pelvic mri and everything looked normal. 

Thanks for reading if you’ve gotten this far. My questions are:

Does this sound like IC?

What have been the most effective diagnostic tools for detecting IC? 

Is urethral burning a major symptom as this is the most debilitating symptom I have?

Is there anything I can do at home to alleviate the pain? I just got some quercetin with bromelain 

Do I have a hope of curing or at least managing this so I can return to a normal quality of life? 

I really really appreciate any and all information provided. This has totally wrecked my life and I’m finding it hard to stave off depression.

Burping constantly, painfully bloated, stomach pain any time I ate anything. I am an avid runner, running 70 miles a week, yet I still managed to gain 10 lbs. No doctor was of help. I got a thyroid ultraound, PCOS panel, upper endoscopy, went gluten free, dairy free, tried probiotics, drinking ACV, different supps like magnesium, every blood panel possible. Gluten and dairy free did help and I still adhere to it, but it only helped marginally. I can't explain how awful I felt. The depression and fatigue was consuming. I felt terrible and was just hardly getting through life. I hated how I looked. How can I run so much yet be gaining this much weight?

I even switched to Levothyroxine 88 mg. That was awful and made me feel like I was going to be bald soon with how much hair loss it gave me. I then even tried nothing and went on no medication. Out of the 3- Armour, Levo, or nothing- nothing was the best. But I still couldn't imagine living the rest of my life like this (I'm only 28F, and I was only about 25/26 when this started). Doctors were telling me everything was normal. Normal endoscopy, normal labs, they said my weight gain was normal as people naturally gain weight as they get older. I was only 26!! I thought, I'm so young and in the top 1% in terms of how much I exercise, if it's this hard for me to maintain my weight, how is every average person not obese?

Just a couple weeks ago, I decided I wanted to try Cytomel. I really don't know why I waited so long. I think I saw that it could be hard on your heart or whatever like that, and it made me nervous. I thought, I'm already so anxious, I can't afford to be more anxious. Plus, I saw some forums of people saying it caused hair loss and I didn't want a repeat of the Levo. I had to work really hard. My PCP who has been treating me said he was unfamiliar with the med and couldn't prescribe me. I made an apt on Plush Care and they said they weren't allowed to prescribe Cytomel. I looked all over and finally found Push Care. The doc did make me show my blood labs and proof of past prescriptions. But he prescribed me Liothyronine 25 mcg. Today is only the 9th day I've taken it, and I can't even describe the difference I feel. I do not snoozer my alarm even once. If anything, I almost even stay awake too long at night because I'm so full of energy. I look like I have lost 5 lbs- whether it's actual weight loss or just debloating. But I showed up to Thanksgiving today and my mom immediately told me it looked like I lost weight. My mood is night and day. I literally find myself reaching out to people asking to make plans and being friendly and giving strangers compliments when I'm out. I'll keep this post updated, as I know I'm still early in this switch. But I'll come back with proof on if I actually have lost weight and if I keep staying feeling well.

I do notice a little bit of the anxiety that people might talk about when they start this. But I wouldn't even call it anxiety. My anxiety before was me worrying about everything. I was terrified, almost bordering on obsessive. I would leave my apartment and have to check my stove 5 times to make sure it wasn't on because I was terrified of burning my apartment down while I was gone. This ""anxiety"" is more like I just feel like I'm bouncing off the walls a bit. Like I'm just ready to go. Like if I was having a conversation, I could talk on and on forever. But I don't even think of this as a bad thing. Maybe it'll go away, but if not I don't care. I've spent so long being bedridden and exhausted that I am happily welcoming energy, even if it makes me slightly not so calm at times.

I really can't even put into words how much better I feel. I hated my life. I didn't know how I was going to go on. EVERY part of my life was affected. I feared food and hated eating because I knew I'd be in pain. I watched my diet so much and for what? I still felt like shit. I tried cutting out coffee and caffeine- again made me marginally better, but hardly. Oh and probably what could be helping the weight loss too is that my appetite is a fraction of what it was. I was ravenous before. I literally couldn't eat enough food. I would have to force myself to be hungry because I already ate 2 plates of food. I mean, I was also very active, but still. I was ALWAYS thinking about food. My life revolved around it. I'd panic if I was leaving home for a couple hours because I wouldn't have food readily available. It's not my goal to eat as little as possible or be as skinny as possible. But I feel so much mental clarity just not thinking about food. I just straight up skipped dinner the other day because I wasn't hungry. I don't want to get in that habit- I just share because I can choose to eat now, rather than absolutely needing to eat like before.

Back in high school I (F) had a male best friend. We were super close and inseparable. I physically developed a lot faster than him in the first two years of high school so people saw us more us siblings. However, things changed in grade 11 when he got taller than me and that’s when the dating allegations began from people as our chemistry was undeniable and we were very touchy.

In the second semester of grade 11, we had 3/4 periods together so we spent a lot of time together. In our physics class, we would always ask to work in the hall, and this is where things started getting weird …

We would play games where we would end up totally on top of each other or with him grabbing my butt or something. Then, after school around stairwells and costume rooms and the field outside, we started wrestling a ton. The wrestling was pretty sexual and would consist of a lot of ass grabbing. The last time we talked before the summer, we were on the floor and he was behind me grabbing my boobs and I had my hands over him and it was very sexual. However, we never kissed or actually talked about what we were doing. We would be talking about other things during it. After that, he sent me a message saying he was in love with some random girl so in my mind like it wasn’t that deep. 

We didn’t talk in the summer and grade 12 rolls around. Again, we have many classes together. We weren’t immediately touchy at the start of the year but he was complimenting me a lot. Throughout the weeks, things lead to another and we started getting more and more touchy. Ass, boobs, caressing, but again, no kissing or addressing what we were actually doing. 

The first time we somewhat addressed what we were doing was when we planned to meet up the next day after school. So I had shaved and was ready because I thought things were finally gonna go down. This day was the farthest we had gotten, he took off my bra and stimulated my nipples. At one point, I even unbuttoned his shirt and was playing with his chest. But no kissing or talking about what we were doing. At this point, I thought it was pretty clear we were hooking up, so I started caressing his crotch next to his penis.

He had a weird look on his face and there was silence. Then he stopped me and told me that he really values our friendship and doesn’t want it to get ruined and that we can’t go ahead with it. No means no and he’s allowed to not consent but I’m super confused because wasn’t it bad for our friendship when he was straight up fondling my breasts? What happened in that moment? I have been thinking about it for years and I still have no idea what happened. 

The next day at school, I pulled him aside and apologized for crossing the boundaries. I didn’t really have a crush on him but I was down to smash because I had absolutely no experience and I was super curious about the male body. So I told him that I don’t particularly have feelings for him and he told me, “don’t worry, I know that you don’t, because you wouldn’t have done that if you did”. I still don’t know what he meant by that to this day. My theory is I was super awkward with guys I had crushes on and couldn’t make a move so I guess it was out of character to do that for me if I actually liked him but I still don’t really know what he meant by that. 

The whole time, we were “hooking up” in secret so nobody knew about it. About a week after, he asked out a friend of mine that happens to look just like me. I was flabbergasted because I didn’t even know they knew each other. Things were too awkward for him and I to stay friends after the rejection and I had many classes with the female friend so we ended up being friends instead. They had a weird relationship where they only hung out a few times in months and he ended up almost cheating on her. Then in university, he and I were in the same program and we were both in relationships with other people. But in class, he started telling me about his sex life with his girlfriend in a shocking amount of detail. It almost felt like he was trying to seduce me through the words. Years later, he broke up with her and he hit me up and wanted to get coffee. However, I had a bf at the time and given our history, I didn’t think it would be wise. We haven’t talked since.

While these actions can be effective, they’re not always safe, particularly for those of us riding alone on tricky roads. So, I started thinking: what if there was another way to raise awareness?

In my research, I recently learned about the idea behind [BringYourHelmet.ca](http://www.bringyourhelmet.ca), and I absolutely love the concept. But I found myself wondering—why limit it to just one day?

Why not make it an **everyday thing**?

Here’s the deal: by simply wearing or carrying your helmet everywhere—not just on the bike—you’re making a statement:

* You’re showing that cyclists are a vital part of the community.
* You’re starting conversations about bike safety in unexpected places (work, coffee shops, the grocery store).
* You’re creating a visible reminder to others that safe cycling infrastructure benefits *everyone*.

It’s an easy, quiet way to remind people that cyclists are part of the community and spark conversations about safer streets. No big effort, no confrontation—just visibility. Imagine walking into a café, your helmet clipped to your bag. Someone notices and asks why—and now, you’re talking about the need for safer streets. Or seeing families with helmets on their strollers or scooters, showing solidarity.

Cyclist safety isn’t a one-day concern, so let’s make #BringYourHelmet an everyday movement. Every helmet is a conversation starter, a show of support, and a visible sign that we’re advocating for change—quietly, but powerfully.

Let’s keep it simple and make it a daily habit.

*For the history buffs: this kind of quiet, symbolic action is inspired by Poland’s* ***Orange Alternative Movement*** *in the 1980s. They used humor and small, everyday symbols—like painting dwarfs on walls—to challenge oppression without confrontation. It’s proof that even simple, peaceful acts of solidarity can lead to real change.*

\-       Take off the scopolamine patch

\-       Take gabapentin in the morning when I wake up? (see how I feel)

\-       Continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6 hours

\-       Doctor will call, tell me how the surgery went, see how I’m doing, go over my medications

\-       Minimum amount of activity recommended is walking around for 10-15 minutes every hour on the hour when I’m awake (stimulates intestines and gets rid of the gas causing pain), but can sleep as much as I need

\-       Resume normal diet but avoid greasy, spicy, or heavy foods

\-       Take colace 2-3 times daily

\-       Drink 6-8 glasses of non-caffeinated beverages daily

 

**Dec 11 — TWO DAYS AFTER SURGERY**

\-       More of the same as first day after

 

**Dec 12 — THREE DAYS AFTER SURGERY**

\-       If I feel like I’m moving around the house without issues, then I start tapering off the medication: first stop the gabapentin, then Tylenol, then take ibuprofen as needed (when active, when sore, or preemptively if I anticipate going for long walk)

\-       Can reintroduce herbs and supplements

\-       Likely will start to pass gas and have bowel movements

\-       Only take Milk of Magnesia if I’m OFF gabapentin

 

**Dec 16 — One Week After Surgery**

\-       Glue might start coming off scars 7-10 days after surgery, and after the glue falls off I can apply silicone tape, vitamin E oil, Mederma

\-       Should be tapered off the medication by the end of the first week

\-       Can ride in a car, but in the event of long rides get out to walk around every hour to prevent blood clots

**Dec 23 — Two Weeks After Surgery**

\-       Can start doing some light exercises

 

**Jan 8 — Four Weeks After Surgery**

\-       Virtual follow-up with physician’s assistant who will see how I’m progressing during the second phase of recovery

 

**Jan 20 — Six Weeks After Surgery**

\-       Safe to swim/bathe

\-       Can return to usual exercise and home activities

#The PSE lost 64 points to 6639 ▼1%

Shout-out to **Jing** for laughing at the ""finance bro"" look of the dude in yesterday's meme (just looking at the vest and lanyard makes me cringe), to **antonee** for noting the political instability (foreign investors still invest, they just charge more for the risk) and to **arkitrader** for amplifying my pledge to not waste your time making something out of nothing!

Thank you also to the 20 readers who have already [entered their questions](https://forms.gle/HFzFJiZRM4XNhjyTA) for **Round 2 of the MB Investor Week** with **Cebu Landmasters**. I'm going to forward the questions to CLI tonight, so you have another 10 hours or so to get your questions in by 5 PM!

I really like the effort that CLI put into providing their earnings call slide deck, but also for the ""conversation starters"" that plainly state some things that CLI thinks investors haven't noticed or don't give it enough credit for. 

Check out the purple-ish section below for all the info!

>- **While our debt of P49Bn is fully reported in our books, what is not fully reflected is the P85bn worth of future receivables that is significantly more than enough to cover these debt obligations.**

>- **Based on our talks with the banks, our delinquency rate is among the lowest in the market. Coupled with CLI's track record of delivering its projects, the recognition of our revenues and collectibles are almost assured, albeit reported in our books at a much later date.**

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Golden MV Holdings changes name to “Villar Land Holdings”...** **Golden MV Holdings** [HVN 2150.00 unch; 2% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5da8cff928579332abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)], Manny Villar’s landbanking and deathcare services holding company, gave notice to the exchange yesterday that its board voted to change the name of the company to **“Villar Land Holdings Corp.”** The change will need to be approved by HVN’s shareholders at its upcoming shareholders’ meeting in December before it can be implemented. HVN justified the change by saying that the move is to “align with the recent developments in the company specifically with the acquisition of companies owing land in Villar City.” HVN said the name change will allow the company to “gain further flexibility in undertaking the business expansion.”
>    - ***MB:*** Yeah, no, changing the name means nothing to HVN’s “flexibility” and ability to perform its role in the development of **Villar City**. Sure, the stock is technically named for the Villar Family's deathcare brand, **Golden Haven**, and the business appears to be morphing into something of a vehicle for the development of Villar City, but it’s not necessary for the name of a company to have any relation to what it does, or for the ticker symbol to even match that name. That’s all just optics. Just think about **Figaro Culinary Group** [FCG 0.84 ▼2.3%; 85% avgVol] (nee **Figaro Coffee Group**) which listed as a vehicle for rapid expansion of its pizza business. It didn’t have to list itself as **“Angel’s Pizza Group”**. For mismatching name and ticker, you can look at **Semirara Mining and Power** [SCC 32.00 unch; 49% avgVol] that still trades under the initialism of its original name, **Semirara Coal Corporation**. SCC didn’t have to change its ticker to **SMPC**. I think this move makes sense, but it’s not a game changer. It’s a signal (to me at least) the Villar Family intends to be more deliberate in its use of HVN to develop Villar City. That’s an ambitious project, and the family isn’t getting any younger.

>- **[NEWS]  GCash planning PSE-only IPO in H2/25...** **InsiderPH** reported [[link](https://insiderph.com/bold-move-gcash-ditches-dual-listing-plan-ipo-to-be-a-purely-pse-affair-in-2025)] a “ranking company official” as saying that **GCash** has tentatively scheduled its IPO for the second half of 2025, and that the IPO would not be a dual PH/US listing but instead a dedicated PSE-only listing. As mentioned by InsiderPH, GCash thought it originally needed the dual listing due to concerns that the PSE was not liquid enough to accommodate the sheer size of its ₱59 billion to ₱88 billion IPO. GCash now thinks that the PSE is able to take a transaction of that size. The ranking company official referred to the H2/25 tentative date as “a very soft date”.
>    - ***MB:*** GCash is a massive tease. There’s no doubt the market is hungry for a pure-play mobile wallet bet like GCash, and given the long lines of international investment bankers trying to get into each fundraising round, there’s sure to be a good amount of domestic and international interest even if the IPO is just on the PSE. While it would be wild and foolish to ignore the coming GCash IPO--it’s so big that it could cause price action movements in other stocks as investors migrate out of positions to buy into the deal--the slow walk of all-time slow walks is frustrating to cover and think about. I’ve been wanting to buy a piece of this for literal years. So has everybody else. But do I want to be exit liquidity for the institutional investors who already got their slice of the growth pie? That’s the part I don’t know. The longer we wait, the less interesting the growth story gets for IPO buyers.

>- **[DIVS]  PREIT declares stable (but slightly lower) Q3 dividend...** **Premiere Island Power REIT** [PREIT 2.00 ▼8.3%; 57% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=a068db1b27636148abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)], the **Villar Family’s** industrial lot rental REIT, PREIT declared a Q3/24 dividend of ₱0.0325/share, payable on December 27 to shareholders of record as of December 13. The dividend has an annualized yield of 6.5% based on the previous closing price, which is marginally smaller than PREIT's pre-dividend annualized yield of 6.52%. The total amount of the dividend is ₱107 million, which is 90% of the ₱119 million in distributable income that PREIT reported for the quarter. Relative to PREIT's IPO price, the dividend increased PREIT's total stock and dividend return to 53.95%, up from its pre-dividend total return of 51.79%. PREIT will have distributed the minimum 90% of its distributable income through the first three quarters of FY24.
>    - ***MB:*** We shouldn’t expect the Villar Family to have much difficulty in collecting rent from its related party power producing companies; PREIT earns contractual (lease) income from a small number of plots that the Villars are using to run diesel generators in remote locations. If that sounds small in scope, it’s because... it is. PREIT is tiny. In terms of marketcap, it’s worth just ₱6.5 billion and is only half the size of the next-biggest REIT, **VistaREIT** [VREIT 1.79 ▲0.6%; 239% avgVol] at ₱13.4 billion. For comparison, another REIT that makes its money renting land to power producers, **Citicore Energy REIT** [CREIT 3.02 ▼1.0%; 93% avgVol], is worth three times as much at ₱19.8 billion, and **AREIT** [AREIT 39.20 ▼1.5%; 61% avgVol] is worth a whopping ₱125.8 billion. PREIT is also one of just two REITs **DDMP** [DDMPR 1.02 ▲2.0%; 145% avgVol] being the other one) that has not planned or executed any kind of asset injection to grow its dividend. So why (or how) does it trade with essentially the same annualized yield as CREIT, and compete with AREIT for the lowest yielding REIT on the PSE? The stock dropped 8% yesterday on the dividend declaration, though I’m not sure why. PREIT’s exactly what it told us it would be. Nothing more. Sometimes a little less, but not egregiously so.

It recently came to my attention that I'm one of many who meticulously plan exactly how many ingredients I'll need to make a specific dish for the rest of the week. I made this calculator some time ago and recently updated it with the addition of Rousing Coffee and all the new dishes that came with it. It's been very helpful to maximize efficiency and ensure I'll only make the best possible dish every day of the week. 

My pot is at max capacity already, so I only focus on particular dishes for each week (curries, salads, or desserts/drinks), but this will be helpful no matter your pot size. So, if you're like me and sometimes struggle with your max ingredient inventory cap, this will help you keep only the needed amount for each ingredient. (don't hoard 300 milk if you only need 96 more; this will leave room for other ingredients you may need.)

This tool has also been a lifesaver for events with set kinds of dishes, making sure you have the ingredients you'll need for the event in advance, which means you can focus on berries or skill specialists.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1h281vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmploymentLaw/comments/1h281vy/unpaid_mileage_and_paid_out/,UNPAID mileage and paid out,"Hello, I was previously separated from a very well-known coffee company. I just sent over my complaint to the EEOC, I am a black woman over 40, so I check mini boxes for being in the protected class. 

On my final day when I was fired, I did not receive my mileage payout or my reimbursement for a purchase that I use my personal credit card for. I shared two times with my HR that I needed to be reimbursed and paid. They stated they needed to know exactly where I was and how many miles. I shared. They took my work laptop and phone and I have no access to be able to get that information to them. She stated she would reach out to my Old regional Director and see if he could get him into my calendar and I've heard nothing since it's been almost 6 months and I still haven't received my pay. This just adds to the long list of the things I had to endure while being a black woman over the age of 40 as a single mom with a son who had a complex medical issue. As much as this supports my claims of discrimination I can't afford to not be paid as I do not have a job and I'm having a very hard time finding one.

 Would this fall under not being paid properly at the time of separation and I would need to contact the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division office? Is there a penalty for them since they have not paid me? 

I've also found a very challenging to find an attorney to support my lawsuit as the company is large and I'm only one person and it feels almost that the people that I have connected with around my case with them, not being person of color don't understand that the things i've had to endure our indeed discrimination, retaliation and racism. Just because nobody is blatantly saying the N-word doesn't mean it's not racism or discrimination.

Doctors seem to either not know what to diagnose him with, or say different theories. Therapists have said that they are unable to continue progressive work with him. We don't know what to do next and are scared of doing the wrong things.



I am the older brother (26) writing about my younger brother (19). Before I set up the story and get into the details, I want to prioritize some observations about him to keep in mind when reading the post. I am not a doctor nor is my mom.



My younger  brother was always zoning out in times growing up. He did have friends as a child but struggled to participate in things that require human interaction and people skills. He was signed up for so many activities and did not object to any. Today we find him spending his time staring at walls. To give you an idea, he can stay in bed the entire day and do nothing. I mean nothing. He can be on a 14 hour flight and stare in his seat and do nothing, not even use the bathroom. Staring in front of him with no tv, no game, no book. We try to offer him a movie to watch or something to do but he chooses not to. No interest in movies, music, exercise, nothing. He can go hours even days without eating unless my mother makes him food and asks him to eat. He has virtually no interest and no hobbies and hasn't had a friend for 5 years. He pulls his phone out in social situations just to scroll left and right on his homepage. He doesn't actually do anything on it. We think it's to reduce some form of anxiety when in public or with people in general. He is silent in conversation and doesn't talk unless being talked to, even then he replies with. Maybe, sometimes, yes, no, kinda and essentially one word answers. He is slow at processing and moving from one activity to the other. To get him out of the house can take hours, to get him out of the car can also be hours. He lives in an extreme denial of his life that he is okay and can do well in all situations, while on the other hand he seems that he is extremely hard on himself. It almost seems like he has to put on a strong front with a lot of pride in order to cope with the lack of ability to obtain a job, do well in school, and socialize. He blacks out at times of high anxiety and stress. He doesn't remember hitting me or calling my mom names. (more of this portion later)



My little brother lives with my mom and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is extremely nice and sweet and will never get in between them or try and raise my younger brother. My mother loves him extremely and can suffocate him at times with being at his every need. I can't blame her given that if she doesn't cook every meal then he simply won't eat. My little brother does not do what he is told, it almost seems that he is not capable at simple tasks. Like his mind is his own prison that restricts him from doing anything that he wants to do. He always says he will do something and ends up not. Examples are when he is asked to go outside for 30 min he says he will later and on his own time but finds himself in his bed instead. My mother does everything to get him out of bed, she works minimal hours so she can be present and revolves her life around him. She can do this due to having money saved up. He has had some small wins like getting a drivers license, starting school at a community college and spending time with a group of friends for an hour a week at an organized event. He does great at his math classes but fails his english classes. He lies about going to the guidance counselor and talking about classes next term as he is lost and doesn't know how to navigate college yet wont ask for help. It took me an entire day of pulling teeth to get him to show me his English grade that he said he was receiving a good grade and ended up not submitting the past 15 assignments and having a 47%. Interesting thing is he submitted the first 15 or so assignments and was receiving good grades, then he stopped all of a sudden. It seems that he lacks motivation in life for practically anything. It seems that he is paralyzed by his anxiety to do anything. Yet when I ask him questions about situations that he froze in, he wants to be left alone and laughs at it and lies that it was for a made up reason. I asked him if he felt nervous, or if his heart rate went up, or why he changed his mind. He seems to be disconnected from his emotions completely.



My part. I have an opposite approach than my mother. My father has not been much a part of his life from year 14 to present day. My father set boundaries and limitations while my mother struggled to. When I talk to my mom I try to explain to her that she must set boundaries, otherwise he will never achieve any independence or happiness. He will continue to stay put in his comfortable situation, rather than take chances and risks to expand his life. I tell him that he must show his mother his grades at school, that he needs to go outside at times. I am scared this feeds into his low self esteem and ends up hurting him more, but I don't know what to do otherwise. I want to recognize he has something but we don't know what it is. We have had professionals say he is not depressed or anxious while others said he is both. We have had professionals say he has a form of autism, while others say he does not. I try to get my mother to force a healthy routine in his life of what he is capable of, with consequences. Thing is we can't give him any since he has nothing in his life he values that we could take from him. He is 19 but I can't get my mother to give him the consequence of sleeping outside. She doesn't have it in her. I do but I know that if I force this when I am around and my mother doesn't then it won't solve anything. Rather it would do more harm than good. I dont stay with my mothers long enough to instill positive behavior and routine.



When I push him. When I push him too hard he can blow up. This has only happened a few times. Ex: I came to visit during the summer and we drove two hours to a specific hike on 100 degree day. He wanted to stay in the car and I was not having it. He ended up blowing up and hitting me while he was screaming ‘just hit me already’ yet I have never hit him in my adult life. As kids we played rough at times but even then I would take his hits and rarely hit him back or retaliate. During these times of stress his entire body goes berserk. He slams doors, sprints away, breathes heavily, screams at the top of his lungs and his face goes to anger. He blacks out and doesn't remember any of these events. 



Lies and argumentative. Pretty self explanatory. Even when caught red handed he denies it with all his ability. It almost seems like he views as the world against him. He plays on my moms emotions to get what he wants. He makes her feel bad for him so he can be left alone and not do the things he say he will do that would be good for him.



I had a talk with him about exposure therapy. Since he couldnt get the courage to walk up and ask for a job, I ask him to go buy a coffee for me so he talks with the person at the counter. He laughs and says that he can do it and that its easy. Yet I try to reason with him saying that when we went to costco so he could ask for a job he didnt pull through with it. Thats why we need to start small. He seemed to tense up and ask me questions like what exactly should I say. I tell him to order a small black coffee, as a way to keep it simple. He asks me if the lady will ask him any more questions afterwords. I told him she might ask if he wants sugar and to say no to that question. We needed to go over this a few times in order to prep him. He ended up completing this and I praised him for it. Yet when i praised him for it he shrugged it off like it was nothing and it was a joke. That he easily could have done it. I give him genuin compliments at times and he turns it around like im making fun of him, when I give him pointers to be successful he takes it as criticism instead.



Doesnt open up. Not to my mom, me or any therapist he has ever talked to. Which is why therapists stop working with him since they cant make progress.



A bit more about him and his life. My family moved around a lot. Including myself but him most since he was 7 years younger than me. Always new environment, new friends, new cultures. When he was younger he was laughing and joking and playful. He played piano and was really good at it. He played sports growing up including water polo and soccer. He spent time with friends and me and him have always had a close relationship. When I left the house at 18 and he was 11 things seemed fine. I went through drug addiction and got clean at 22. My sister had her tantrums growing up and left at 17. My father and mother split when i was 22 and he was 15. I didnt notice any of the bad blood between them, but it started to escalate a year or so after I left the house around the time I was most deep into my addiction. During this time I believe my little brother was neglected. I spent years raising him as a teenager since my father spent his time traveling for work. He was essentially left alone all of a sudden, with parents who fought regularly and no one to turn to. Given his character we also think he may have been bullied at school. We never found out through him. Around this time is when he closed up. 



Medication: recently he started taking an ssri. Otherwise nothing.

Today was really challenging—she was fussy all day, crying almost constantly while we were walking, at a coffee shop, and on the way home. It feels like going out is hard for her, especially since it’s winter where I live. I make sure she’s dressed warmly, but she’s more awake during the day since she sleeps well at night.

I love walking outside, but it’s become so stressful that it’s taking the joy out of it. At the same time, staying home makes me feel down, especially when it’s so bright and inviting outside. Can anyone relate?",1,1732834919.0,firsttimemom,0,1.0,False

Doctors seem to either not know what to diagnose him with, or say different theories. Therapists have said that they are unable to continue progressive work with him. We don't know what to do next and are scared of doing the wrong things.

I am the older brother (26) writing about my younger brother (19). Before I set up the story and get into the details, I want to prioritize some observations about him to keep in mind when reading the post. I am not a doctor nor is my mom.

My younger  brother was always zoning out in times growing up. He did have friends as a child but struggled to participate in things that require human interaction and people skills. He was signed up for so many activities and did not object to any. Today we find him spending his time staring at walls. To give you an idea, he can stay in bed the entire day and do nothing. I mean nothing. He can be on a 14 hour flight and stare in his seat and do nothing, not even use the bathroom. Staring in front of him with no tv, no game, no book. We try to offer him a movie to watch or something to do but he chooses not to. No interest in movies, music, exercise, nothing. He can go hours even days without eating unless my mother makes him food and asks him to eat. He has virtually no interest and no hobbies and hasn't had a friend for 5 years. He pulls his phone out in social situations just to scroll left and right on his homepage. He doesn't actually do anything on it. We think it's to reduce some form of anxiety when in public or with people in general. He is silent in conversation and doesn't talk unless being talked to, even then he replies with.

It took me an entire day of pulling teeth to get him to show me his English grade that he said he was receiving a good grade and ended up not submitting the past 15 assignments and having a 47%. Interesting thing is he submitted the first 15 or so assignments and was receiving good grades, then he stopped all of a sudden. It seems that he lacks motivation in life for practically anything. It seems that he is paralyzed by his anxiety to do anything. Yet when I ask him questions about situations that he froze in, he wants to be left alone and laughs at it and lies that it was for a made up reason. I asked him if he felt nervous, or if his heart rate went up, or why he changed his mind. He seems to be disconnected from his emotions completely.

My part. I have an opposite approach than my mother. My father has not been much a part of his life from year 14 to present day. My father set boundaries and limitations while my mother struggled to. When I talk to my mom I try to explain to her that she must set boundaries, otherwise he will never achieve any independence or happiness. He will continue to stay put in his comfortable situation, rather than take chances and risks to expand his life. I tell him that he must show his mother his grades at school, that he needs to go outside at times. I am scared this feeds into his low self esteem and ends up hurting him more, but I don't know what to do otherwise. I want to recognize he has something but we don't know what it is. We have had professionals say he is not depressed or anxious while others said he is both. We have had professionals say he has a form of autism, while others say he does not. I try to get my mother to force a healthy routine in his life of what he is capable of, with consequences. Thing is we can't give him any since he has nothing in his life he values that we could take from him. He is 19 but I can't get my mother to give him the consequence of sleeping outside. She doesn't have it in her. I do but I know that if I force this when I am around and my mother doesn't then it won't solve anything. Rather it would do more harm than good. I dont stay with my mothers long enough to instill positive behavior and routine.

When I push him. When I push him too hard he can blow up. This has only happened a few times. Ex: I came to visit during the summer and we drove two hours to a specific hike on 100 degree day. He wanted to stay in the car and I was not having it. He ended up blowing up and hitting me while he was screaming ‘just hit me already’ yet I have never hit him in my adult life. As kids we played rough at times but even then I would take his hits and rarely hit him back or retaliate. During these times of stress his entire body goes berserk. He slams doors, sprints away, breathes heavily, screams at the top of his lungs and his face goes to anger. He blacks out and doesn't remember any of these events. 

Lies and argumentative. Pretty self explanatory. Even when caught red handed he denies it with all his ability. It almost seems like he views as the world against him. He plays on my moms emotions to get what he wants. He makes her feel bad for him so he can be left alone and not do the things he say he will do that would be good for him.

I had a talk with him about exposure therapy. Since he couldnt get the courage to walk up and ask for a job, I ask him to go buy a coffee for me so he talks with the person at the counter. He laughs and says that he can do it and that its easy. Yet I try to reason with him saying that when we went to costco so he could ask for a job he didnt pull through with it. Thats why we need to start small. He seemed to tense up and ask me questions like what exactly should I say. I tell him to order a small black coffee, as a way to keep it simple. He asks me if the lady will ask him any more questions afterwords. I told him she might ask if he wants sugar and to say no to that question. We needed to go over this a few times in order to prep him. He ended up completing this and I praised him for it. Yet when i praised him for it he shrugged it off like it was nothing and it was a joke. That he easily could have done it. I give him genuin compliments at times and he turns it around like im making fun of him, when I give him pointers to be successful he takes it as criticism instead.

Doesnt open up. Not to my mom, me or any therapist he has ever talked to. Which is why therapists stop working with him since they cant make progress.

A bit more about him and his life. My family moved around a lot. Including myself but him most since he was 7 years younger than me. Always new environment, new friends, new cultures. When he was younger he was laughing and joking and playful. He played piano and was really good at it. He played sports growing up including water polo and soccer. He spent time with friends and me and him have always had a close relationship. When I left the house at 18 and he was 11 things seemed fine. I went through drug addiction and got clean at 22. My sister had her tantrums growing up and left at 17. My father and mother split when i was 22 and he was 15. I didnt notice any of the bad blood between them, but it started to escalate a year or so after I left the house around the time I was most deep into my addiction. During this time I believe my little brother was neglected. I spent years raising him as a teenager since my father spent his time traveling for work. He was essentially left alone all of a sudden, with parents who fought regularly and no one to turn to. Given his character we also think he may have been bullied at school. We never found out through him. Around this time is when he closed up.

I do eat two eggs every single day. And I started doing that in May after I was attempting to increase my veggie intake (I scramble eggs with like two cups of veg). Could that be part of it?
