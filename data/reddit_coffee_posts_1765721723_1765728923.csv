1pmhsbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodToronto/comments/1pmhsbh/good_coffee_place/,Good Coffee Place,"Hi,

My husband and I are new to Toronto-ish now. I have been on the hunt for a great coffee for my husband who is very picky with the flavor profile of his coffee. We live in Midtown and have tried almost all near our condo. His profile is a strong dark but not burnt, with a slightly bitter note. At least that's what I taste when I drink coffee that he just swoons over. Does anyone know where I can find a place that has that? Or even a really rich dark mocha (I'm assuming his favorite place doesn't use syrup but actual cocoa)?

His favorite place was in QC so I think it might be difficult as the places he's mentioned are either there or in Europe... So difficult task I think for Canadian standards. I'm not a big coffee connaisseur and I think some of them taste fine, but I do prefer a mild flavor if I do drink it. 

Help a wifey out! I recommend places that people say have great coffee only to have to listen to him tell me that it's bland and not good. I just want to go to a coffee and be happy once we get served. 🙏🙏🥺",1,1765728826.0,FoodToronto,0,1.0,False
1pmhs69,https://www.reddit.com/r/frontierairlines/comments/1pmhs69/my_plane_type_was_changed_fun_times/,My plane type was changed. Fun times.,"They changed the plane and even the FAs didn’t know. I booked my usual exit row because I want the extra space to stretch out my legs. But now I’m in a standard \*\*window\*\* (geez, I’m going to hurt when I eventually pry myself out of this cubby hole 😣). I let the FA’s know, they say the plane isn’t full, and they may be able to move me to an aisle or less full row. I also let them know my attitude: \*\*I’m on the plane.\*\* I’ve had times when I \*wasn’t\* on the plane. But I appreciate anything they can do. 

But this party is just getting started. I notice in the new exit row a family that appears to be grandparents (she’s hunched, and I can see the arthritis in his gnarled hands) and their grandson (\*maybe\* he’s 15) which explains why they were on before me, they were in the preboard group.  I can’t be the only exit row person no longer in an exit row. 

🍿🍿🍿🍿

Or vice versa. The next person assigned to the new exit row has an infant, and she is freaking out seeing that she is in an exit row. Being off coffee while breast feeding is definitely taking its toll on her (jk, jk, jk). FA’s get to kill two birds with one stone as she and I flip-flop. 

Sidebar: And this is another reason why I board at the front of my group (one). Not too long ago I was in a thread where the debate was over boarding first and boarding last. I like to get on asap and get situated before the madness/stupidity starts.  Others prefer to board last after the madness/stupidity has ended. If I had moseyed on last, I wouldn’t have regained my exit row seat. That kerfuffle would’ve been resolved long before I arrived. Like the guy who came on late, and due the plane change his seat no longer existed (the row in front of the exit row had jump seats, and only two seats for passengers). Instead of row 10 they put him in row 38. His. face. showed. he intentionally booked the front, not the back of the plane. But again: he’s \*\*on\*\* the plane.  

Weird (not really, we know what we’re dealing with) that the pre-boarders and mother with infant weren’t flagged by the GA since the passengers clearly couldn’t comply with the exit row responsibilities. I’m always asked the compliance question when I scan my boarding pass (it didn’t register til just now that I wasn’t asked this time). 

But lesson learned. I’m always checking to make sure the gate and seat assignment hasn’t changed. Now I have to also check the plane assignment too 😒",1,1765728816.0,frontierairlines,0,1.0,False

***


Winter light puddled across the Diaz couch like a lukewarm blanket. Janna surfaced from sleep with her beanie crooked over one eye and a knit throw half-kicked to the floor. Holly, a smug armful of black-smoke cat, had chosen the square inches of Janna's ribs as her throne. A kettle whistled somewhere in the house. The air smelled like cinnamon and clean laundry.


Holly chirped a soft question-mrrrp.


""I know, boss,"" Janna rasped into the cushion. ""Union break.""


Pipes thumped overhead; the shower shut off. Janna levered herself upright, collecting the beanie with the back of her wrist. Her hands did their usual morning twitch—little side flutters she never acknowledged—and she pressed the fluorite pendant to her sternum until the inside noise remembered how to be quiet enough to ignore.


""Breakfast on the stove, mija!"" Angie called from the kitchen. ""Marco—don't be late!""


""Waffle?"" Rafael sang. ""I make waffle!""


Janna slouched to her feet. ""You absolute menaces,"" she told the ceiling, deadpan, and Holly followed like a furry ankle monitor.


The hallway bathroom door was ajar, steam slipping out in ghosty ribbons. Janna nudged it with two fingers and walked straight into Marco Diaz in a towel.


They both froze—him with the exact expression he made when a guest at Bullseye tried to stack ten coupons and a threat, her with a scientist's interested squint she shouldn't be having.


He was flushed from the shower, hair dripping lines down his collarbones, towel braced in one hand like a shield he'd rather not be using.


""Ords—!"" he yelped, jumping an octave he probably wished he hadn't.


""Scientific observation,"" she murmured, eyes averting a respectful inch. ""You do, in fact, have a torso.""


Color climbed higher in his face. ""Door. Knock. Basic civilization?""


""Heh."" She backed out, palms up. ""Counterpoint: I live here now. Sorta.""


""Two minutes,"" he pleaded, flustered and earnest in the way that used to make her want to gnaw on him out of spite. ""Clothes in two minutes. Please don't roast me while I'm vulnerable.""


""Certified retreat,"" she promised. ""No jokes."" A beat. ""Maybe one. Later.""


***


She pulled the door gently shut, then pressed the beanie brim to her eyebrows for three counts. *Kalma lang.* Not today.


The kitchen was warm enough to feel like a spell. Marco, fully clothed now in a red flannel and work jeans, shoveled eggs into a to-go container while Angie slid a plate toward Janna and Rafael flipped a waffle with celebratory flair.


""Eat,"" Angie said, soft authority wrapped in kindness. ""Then rest. You look like a raccoon who lost a fight with glitter.""


""That's my brand,"" Janna said, accepting the plate. Her voice came out steadier than she felt.


Holly hopped to the chair beside her and stared with golden, unblinking interest at the butter.


""Syrup? Butter? Salsa?"" Rafael offered, already wielding all three.


""Yes,"" Janna said politely, and tried not to melt at how quickly this house handed out little comforts like they weren't brittle and rare.


Marco capped his container and set a sticky note on top in his too-neat handwriting: *Holly: 1/3 can (AM). Water.*


He looked at Janna like he was bracing and then made himself soften.


""I'm on a long shift,"" he said. ""Four to close if Brandon cries. House rules while you're here: one—feed Holly. Two—please don't touch anything. Three—seriously, Ords, don't go through my room.""


Janna held his gaze with her best innocent gremlin face. ""Copy. I will absolutely not open the forbidden nerd vault labeled 'Marco's Room'.""


""I'm serious.""


""Me too."" She sipped water like absolution. ""Certified promise.""


He squinted. She didn't blink.


Angie pushed a mug of tea into her hand and smoothed an imaginary wrinkle from Janna's sleeve the way a mom does when she's already decided you're hers.


""You can nap in the guest room if the couch hurts your back,"" Angie said.


""The couch is good,"" Janna replied. ""Feels like... childhood trauma with lumbar support.""


""Ah,"" Rafael said gravely. ""Memory foam.""


Holly head-butted Janna's knee. Without looking, Janna peeled a shark sticker from her pocket and slapped it on Marco's to-go container.


He stared at it, then at her. ""Is that a sticker bribe?""


""It's called positive reinforcement, Hoodie Boy. Look it up.""


The corner of his mouth betrayed him with a fond twitch. He grabbed his keys, then paused in the doorway. The house got quieter around the pause.


""You good?"" he asked.


Janna's throat did a small, stupid tighten. She hated that. ""I'm not dead,"" she said softly. ""And I can watch a cat. Go be a hero.""


He looked like he wanted to argue about the hero part, then decided not to. Two taps to the doorframe—Diaz superstition—and he was gone. The deadbolt clicked. Warm kitchen noise folded into the hollow of the living room.


Silence hummed. The house settled.


Janna stood in the middle of the rug with her hands buried in the hoodie's sleeves and felt herself drift toward her default idle animation: wrists curling inward, fingers fluttering at her sides in tiny, controlled bursts.


""Don't be weird,"" she told herself out loud.


Holly *mrrrped* and hopped onto the couch arm, where she could supervise any upcoming crimes.


""Different definition of 'weird,' roommate."" Janna fed the cat, measured out a neat third of a can and a precise little hill of food, swapped the water, rinsed the tin. She aligned the recycling label-out because it felt like winning at something small. She wiped the counter. Responsible. Trustworthy. See?


House rules followed. She even put her cup in the sink.


Then the worst possible thing happened: the house stayed quiet long enough for her brain to spin.


If she held still, she thought. If she thought, she remembered. If she remembered—nope. She shook her hands out, the flutter returning. A systems check, then. Perimeter walk. Not toward the stairs—obviously not—just parallel to them like a moon in a lazy orbit.


Halfway up the staircase she slowed at the gallery of Diaz family photos. Mariposa in a sticker crown, cheeks shiny with pride. Star on the porch mid-mrrrp, cheekmarks faint and bright at once. Marco in fencing gear, mask tucked under his arm, smiling like he didn't know anyone was looking.


Janna didn't touch the glass; her thumb hovered anyway.


She moved on. At the top of the stairs, the guest room sat open, a polite mouth of blankets and spare pillows. Steam ghosted from the bathroom, clean tile breathing out the last of Marco's shower heat.


And across from both, pulled to but not latched, waited the door to Marco's room.


*DO NOT ENTER*, read the little plaque in her mind, because she was trying to be a better version of herself and better people did not pry open someone's life when he'd just given you a couch and a bowl and a list with your cat's name on it.


*root access requested*, replied her gremlin brain.


Holly appeared on the landing with a teleporting lack of footsteps and sat like a sphinx. *Mrrrp.*


""He said don't touch anything,"" Janna whispered, humor thin as wire. ""Not don't look at the general concept of doors.""


She put two fingertips on the paint. The door nudged inward a whisper, loud as a confession in her chest.


Air rolled out—laundry warmth, graphite, a ghost of cologne. Under it, a clean note she'd learned by accident: dish soap from his hands caught in cotton. Her face softened before she could stop it. She filed the data the way she filed everything that hurt a little—neatly and out of order.


Okay. Just a peek. For science. To calibrate the environment. Responsible.


She stopped herself. Stepped back. Planted her feet on the carpet and shook out her hands until the urge clicked loose.


Be better, she told herself. Don't make a mess in the only house that doesn't ask you to earn the couch.


She turned toward the open guest room and made it three whole steps. Holly followed, tail high.


Eight seconds later Janna pivoted like a traitor to her own sermon.


""Heh,"" she said to no one, and curled her fingers around the knob.


The latch kissed free with a soft tick. The room beyond was dim and familiar—bed made badly, hoodie slung over the back of the desk chair, a stack of notebooks on the desk like a dare. The smell of him was stronger inside the threshold, enough to make her feel simultaneously heavier and lighter, like someone had swapped out the air for memory.


""You saw me try,"" she told the cat, voice dropping to that private, gravel-soft register she never used on purpose.


Holly didn't blink.


Janna slipped inside. The door breathed the rest of the way open behind her.


It wasn't even exciting, which made it worse. Top drawer: pens lined up, sticky notes in a brick, a coil of string, a tiny bottle of superglue. Under that, a shallow tray: quarters nested in a roll, and two folded bills with the soft texture of allowance saved and forgotten. Twenty, and another ten.


A habit pulsed in her hands the way a bad song gets into your bones—take it, hide it, you never know—and she let herself be the kind of person who did.


""It's for emergencies,"" she told the quiet room. ""I'm an emergency.""


She slid the twenty and the ten into the small inner pocket of her hoodie, the one that sat like a secret against her ribs. Guilt prickled across her scalp. She could put it back later. She would put it back later. She would.


Second drawer: more him—old ticket stubs, a folded paper covered in figures and arrows labeled *parry riposte drills*, a rubber band ball that snapped when she squeezed it. At the back sat a spiral notebook with corners chewed by time and a strip of masking tape across the cover: *D-J-S (No.)* The ""No."" was underlined twice and angry.


She could leave it. She could be better. She peeled the notebook up with a careful, disgraceful gentleness, closed the drawer, and sat cross-legged on the floor with her back to his bed.


The first page was a map of crossed-out beginnings. He had written ""Dear diary"" and stabbed the line through with a pen. Below that: ""Log? Journal? Whatever."" A box: *Don't be cringe.* Her mouth twitched—fond, unwilling.


Ink settled into sentences a few pages in—sophomore fall into winter, the year after the mrrrp-girl arrived. She braced and read.


**Journal**


*Janna sat next to me in bio again. I told Mr. Diaz that was fine and then realized Mr. Diaz is me, and I made a face and she laughed at me for making a face at my own name. She's... I don't know. She steals my stuff and then tells me she stole my stuff and acts like that's honesty. Is that honesty? I think it's honesty. She put a sticker of a shark on my locker today and called it ""insulation."" It's dumb. I left it.*


""Heh,"" Janna murmured, even as her throat burned a little. Holly, now installed on the bed like a magistrate, blinked down at her.


She flipped forward. The handwriting grew faster.


**Journal**


*Star says Janna is ""a gremlin in the walls."" She says it with hearts in her eyes, so that's not helpful. Janna followed me to Britta's and I told her she was creepy because she showed up exactly when I was trying not to think, and she didn't even blink. She just said, ""You're welcome,"" and stole one of my fries and then gave me half back. Who steals and then gives your stuff back like store credit?*


""Store credit,"" she echoed, tiny smile failing to land.


Rain began as a soft tapping and gathered into a steadier percussion. Janna flipped further, past a year marker. The next notebook's spine was labeled **2017** in block pen. A dog-eared page waited as if it had been handled too many times.


**November 9, 2017**


*Jackie broke up with me. She said I loved Star... I was an idiot and wore the cape Star gave me to our date. Janna went through my stuff again probably. Checked my wallet, my social security card was missing. She gave it back and when I asked why she had it she said ""don't ask questions you don't want the answers to."" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?*


*Ugh. I hate that she can't talk like a normal person. She always has to be weird and cryptic. She's always been like that and I don't get why. Does she like me? Does she like watching me suffer? I dunno. It's Janna Ordonia, and she doesn't make any sense. I think she likes me and also likes poking me.*


Janna stared at the block capitals until they ghosted. The rain deepened; it made the room feel smaller and truer. Of course he'd kept that page. Of course he'd made himself look right at the mess and try to name it.


She slid to an earlier section—the handwriting rounder, smudged at the edges.


**September 27, 2016 - Star's sleepover**


*We almost got killed by a cursed Rubik's Cube. Jackie was there, Starfan, and... Janna. She creeps me out, but I can't help but wonder if she has some sort of obsession with me. She looked at me with her usual creepy smirk after the question about our crushes. Then she deflected and said she loved a dead poet instead.*


*I panicked; I thought she was gonna say her crush was me... I could see it in her eyes. I don't get her. I don't get Star either. Girls are weird, and Janna is the weirdest one of them all.*


The rain stamped harder against the glass. Janna's smirk faded on its own. Her thumb traced a line under her name without quite touching the paper.


""Dead poet, huh,"" she murmured. ""Closest I ever came to telling the truth.""


Her fingers were shaking now. She closed the book before her breath could get uneven enough to make a sound and slid the notebooks back exactly where she'd found them, aligning edges like penance. She paced a two-step circuit—door, desk, door—like a moth coming up against a window. The room still smelled like him. That didn't help.


Downstairs, the fridge light buttered the kitchen tile. She told herself she was allowed this part. The Diaz fridge had been a square of sanctuary since the first time Angie asked if she wanted leftovers and refused to accept a joke as an answer.


Second shelf: a deli container with a strip of tape—*Marco: Pasta (Hands off, Rafael!)* and a lopsided smiley face. Janna stabbed a fork in and ate cold by the open door, because cold kept feelings where they were. The sauce tasted like last night and tomatoes and a pan left a minute too long on heat; the carbs went straight to the buzzing place behind her eyes and dimmed it.


She carried the container back up like contraband and set it on the nightstand. Then, apologizing to no one, she sat on the edge of Marco's bed and reached for the hoodie like gravity finishing an equation. It swallowed her instantly, soft and heavy and clean. The sleeves fell past her fingers. She tugged the cuffs to her knuckles and let herself breathe into cotton that smelled like shampoo and sun and that faint dish-soap note from his hands.


The pillow was worse. She lay down like a trespasser and then couldn't remember why the floor had seemed like an option. Her chest loosened by degree until the ache behind her sternum unhooked. She spun the little black band on her ring with her thumb—one, two, three revolutions—until the metal warmed.


""Kalma lang,"" she whispered, to prove she still could.


Holly hopped up with the soundless assurance of a cat who has always owned this space. She turned twice, loafed at Janna's shins, and anchored one heavy paw against her ankle like a paperweight holding the moment in place.


""Traitor,"" Janna told her. Holly slow-blinked.


She meant to get up after a minute. She did not. The room was warm, a winter-soft cave. The house hummed its safe, dull music. Her breath lengthened. Somewhere in the wide, dumb center of her chest, the little machine under her collarbone synced to the new tempo with a quiet click she could feel more than hear.


She slept like a person who had been holding herself upright for a week and forgot, for once, to keep doing it. The snore that leaked out of her was as unguarded as the posture: a small, embarrassing saw. A line of drool complicated the pillowcase. She would hate that later.


On the nightstand, the fork leaned against the pasta container like a flag in soft dirt. The notebooks sat where she'd returned them, their edges squared, their pages settling. In the inner pocket of her hoodie, the bills pressed to her ribs like a warm wrongness she would have to face.


Light moved across the carpet by lazy inches, then faded, inch by inch, toward evening.


***


Marco came home with the kind of tired that sands the edges off everything. The sky was wet graphite. Rain threaded down the eaves and pooled on the porch. He keyed the lock, shouldered the door, and the Diaz house breathed its evening warmth at him: cumin, laundry, a faint curl of Angie's tea.


""How was it?"" Angie called.


""Long,"" he said, trying not to make it sound like blame. ""Where's—""


""Upstairs,"" Rafael answered, pleased. ""Your amiga fed Holly and did a dish. Responsible. I approve.""


A knot in Marco eased, then tightened again. He saw the shark sticker on his morning container and almost smiled, then clocked the absence. His red-and-black hoodie wasn't on the chair. The house was quiet in that particular way.


He took the stairs two at a time. His bedroom door sat pulled to, not latched. His jaw ticked. He pushed it open with two fingers.


Janna was asleep in his bed.


Not just asleep. Sprawled on her side, a bright line of drool on his pillowcase, cuffs of his hoodie swallowed past her hands. On the nightstand: his pasta, lid off, fork leaning like a flag. Holly was loafed at Janna's shins, a citizen who had never obeyed a posted rule.


He didn't explode. He did the worse thing. He stood in the doorway and counted.


Rule one: feed Holly. Fed.


Rule two: don't touch anything.


Rule three: don't go through my room.


He stared at the hoodie on her, the dent in the pillow, the open container. He could feel the old notebooks in the drawer like a pressure point behind his ribs.


""Janna.""


He didn't raise his voice. He didn't need to. She jerked awake, hair flattened in a way he'd normally tease. She took him in, then the pasta, then the hoodie, and tried to hide her hands inside the sleeves like that could rewind the day.


""Hey,"" she croaked, sleep-rough. ""You're back. I was, uh, running a pillow diagnostic.""


""Get up.""


Flat. Too flat. He was out of polish. She sat up fast and pressed her palm to her sternum on reflex, like she was reminding her heart to keep time. He registered it and kept going. He clicked the pasta lid on with a small snap that sounded like a door shutting, then pinched the hoodie cuff and tugged.


She let him. He set the hoodie on the chair where it belonged and opened the desk.


""Don't,"" she said, soft.


Pens lined up. Sticky notes in a brick. A rubber band ball. The notebooks stacked at the back were aligned a little too neatly. He checked the upper drawer. Quarters still nested in their roll. The folded bills were not.


""Did you take my cash?"" he asked, eyes on the drawer.


Silence. Then the whisper of fabric as she dug into the hidden inner pocket and set a twenty and a ten on the desk like heat.


""It's not just the money,"" he said, and realized it was also the money, because the empty space carried an old, ugly feeling. ""You promised me. You said 'Certified promise,' looked me in the face, and then..."" He gestured at the bed, the container, the drawer. ""All three. In one day.""


""I know."" She stood very still, sleeves fisted in her palms like she was holding her own hands hostage. ""I'm sorry.""


""Are you?"" He hated the sharpness and meant it anyway. ""Because this keeps happening. You push, you poke, you take, and I say it's fine, and then you do it again because me saying it's fine becomes the data you wanted. Like you're stress-testing me to see when I break.""


She flinched like he'd thrown something. He hadn't. He kept his hands at his sides.


""Did you read my journals?""


A beat. She nodded once.


Something split slow under his sternum. ""Those were me trying to figure things out. You. Me. Star. Jackie. They weren't for you.""


""I know."" This time it scraped on the way out. ""I shouldn't have. I... wanted to know how you saw me when I wasn't there to make you hate me.""


""Why would you think—""


""Because if you hate me,"" she said, monotone fraying, ""then it's clean. If you like me, it's a trap. If I steal and you still feed me, maybe I'm real and not just..."" She made a small circle at her chest. ""A glitch in a hoodie. I don't know how to do *please don't leave* without using a crowbar.""


Under the deadpan he heard the wire-spark of panic. Her chin dent trembled. Her hands had started those small side flaps, subtle as wings.


""Okay."" He steadied his voice. ""Listen. For real, not the remix. You can't treat care like a vending machine. You don't plug in a bad behavior and see if a Marco drops out. That isn't care. That's a fire drill.""


She swallowed. ""I know.""


""Stop saying you know if you're going to do it again tomorrow.""


That landed. She touched the thin line under her collarbone where the pacemaker pocket sat. ""I won't,"" she said, barely audible. ""I didn't want to break your room. I just... wanted to know if you wrote me down.""


He nodded once. He had one more thing and he wasn't going to skip it. ""I need to ask you something. Real answer. No crowbar."" He held her eyes. ""Do you like me?""


She could have joked. She didn't.


""Yes,"" she said, small and even. ""Since, like, sophomore bio.""


""Back then too?""


A shallow nod. ""Back then too.""


""Was the creepy stuff because you didn't know how to ask for affection?""


Three seconds, then she let her gaze fall. ""Yeah. I run scripts when feelings show up. My brain goes joke first, survive sincerity later. Eye contact gets loud. Hands do... the thing."" She glanced at the flutter. ""If I ask, I feel visible. If I steal your hoodie or your fries, I'm near you without declaring anything. Heh. Weak sauce.""


A puzzle piece he'd never placed clicked. The annoyance didn't vanish, but it moved over to make room for understanding.


""Thank you,"" he said.


She looked startled, like she'd expected a cross-exam, not thanks.


""I'm still mad,"" he went on. ""You're paying me back. You're cleaning the pillowcase. You're not touching the journals again. And next time your brain wants to do a bad thing, you tell me before it does it. We make a list longer than 'don't.' We make a 'do'.""


""A 'do',"" she echoed, almost relieved. ""Copy.""


""And sit down. Your hands are shaking.""


She obeyed, graceless in a way that looks like defeat until you know better. He put water in her hand. She drank.


The quiet held. He looked at her—really looked—and, for once, didn't see the gremlin first. He saw Soft Janna.


She was sitting on the edge of his bed with her fingers curled into her skirt, trembling slightly—doe-eyed and afraid in a way she would rather chew glass than admit. He reached without thinking and folded his hand over hers. Her hand tensed, then loosened under the warmth. She looked up at him for one clean heartbeat.


Something in him slipped. His lips met hers.


""I shouldn't have..."" he blurted, nervous laugh half-born. ""It's just you're supposed to be creepy, not—whatever this is.""


She stared, stunned. Her lashes dipped. He heard himself again, uselessly: ""Sorry. You're not creepy, Janna. I— I don't know, okay?""


She held his gaze. The flutter at her wrists steadied. She was very brave in the least showy way possible.


""Hey, Marco—"" Her voice came soft and awkward and braver than it sounded. ""That thing... with your lips— Uhh—mind doing it again? I wanna test something.""


""Yeah,"" he said, before doubt could talk him out of it. ""Okay.""


He leaned in and she did too. Noses bumped; teeth clicked; her mouth opened wrong and she bit his tongue.


""Ow—Janna—""


""Sorry."" Mortified, automatic. She looked down. ""I don't... know how."" The words came in a small spill. ""My first real kiss was Tom. On my birthday. Two seconds in a doorway. He asked if I was sure. I panicked and ran."" She swallowed, eyes flicking up to his, then down again. ""*Hindi ko alam kung paano*."" Her voice edged into Tagalog instinct, pleading without drama. ""*Turuan mo 'ko.* Please.""


His chest hurt in a human way. His fingers found her chin and he tilted her head up to meet his gaze. He nodded, steady. ""Okay. Open a little.""


He kissed her again, slower. Gentle enough that she could feel the shape of it, the rhythm. He paused, kissed, paused—giving her places to meet him. She adjusted, curious and earnest, and got it on the second try. Her hand hovered at his shoulder before it settled. The other found his sleeve and fisted there like she was afraid of floating away.


""That's it,"" he breathed against her mouth.


She made a surprised little sound that turned into permission. The ring at her pinky anchored under his thumb when he brushed it; the metal warmed. Vanilla on his breath from breakfast, tomato from the stolen pasta on hers—mundane, simple, real.


They broke an inch to breathe. Their foreheads touched. The room did that strange trick where it shrank to a good size.


""Passing—"" he started to tease, then caught himself and smiled instead. ""You're good.""


""Shut up,"" she whispered, fond and shaky. She was smiling, too.


He stopped first, because boundaries. He rested his forehead to hers one more second, then eased back as deliberately as he had leaned in.


""Pillowcase,"" he said.


""Laundry,"" she echoed, cheeks hot, voice small but intact.


""Boundaries.""


""Copy."" A beat. ""Bruh.""


He huffed half a laugh. He lifted the hoodie and held it out. ""You can wear it. Just ask.""


She took it like it weighed more than cotton. ""Asking engaged.""


""And the journals—""


""I hear you,"" she caught herself, corrected. ""I won't. If I think I might, I'll ask first.""


He nodded. Rain softened to a polite tapping. From downstairs: plates, quiet radio.


""Come eat,"" he said. ""Then we'll wash that and fix what we can fix.""


She nodded—small, grateful. At the threshold she squared the cuffs like she was agreeing to new physics. ""Hey, Diaz,"" she said, almost a whisper. ""I like you. Present tense.""


He didn't joke. He said it plain. ""I like you too, Janna.""


They ate at the counter like it was a truce table—leftovers, tea, silence that didn't press. Someone—Rafael—put a blanket at the end of the couch like a suggestion and then forgot to notice whether they took it. Later, with the washer ticking and the pillowcase turning slow circles into clean, they drifted back upstairs on the same gravity. No speeches. No weirdness. Just tired people who had done a hard thing.


They ended up on top of the covers, side by side, like two magnets finding the angle they didn't fight. Janna in her cropped black tee and his gray sweats (borrowed; asked for; received). Holly loafed at their feet like a heavy blessing. Marco stared at the ceiling until he didn't. Her pacemaker ticked its private metronome. Somewhere in the quiet, it found his heartbeat and took the same step, just for a few beats, like a courtesy.


They fell asleep there, not holding, not performing. Just not alone.


***


**Paradox Pulse**


The lab kept the kind of quiet that pretends to be mercy. Fluorescents breathed. A cup of coffee had given up on being warm. Along the far wall, a rank of monitors washed the room in aquatic teal, graphs crawling like tame EKGs until one of them decided not to be tame.


**ORPHEUS // Telemetry Stream - Unit-02**, said the corner label. The timestamp ticked through **11-01 00:42:17** and the line on the screen stopped pretending it was a sleepy river. It spiked—a clean, surgical tower that doubled on itself for two heartbeats, two rhythms trying to share one corridor—and then it dropped, fluttered, steadied.


Ari wheeled closer, stylus tapping the glass with soft, urgent clicks. Scrubs, sneakers, hair half-out of a bun like they left neatness in the last hour when no one died. ""There,"" they said to the air, already pulling overlays. ""Third anomaly this month.""


Dr. Seraphina Reyes didn't answer right away. She watched the spike the way surgeons watch a bleed: not surprised, not pleased, simply awake in the way that counts. Her hair was clipped flat against ambition; her lab coat buttoned like a closing argument.


""Strip the garbage,"" she said, and Ari stripped the garbage: fireworks, traffic, municipal Wi-Fi patter; neighborhood radios bleeding into the night like bad alibis. The mess fell away. The spike remained, sharper now, more human for the absence of excuses.


Ari stacked another layer—HRV bands, a flimsy catecholamine proxy—and the display bloomed with color, data breathing in a language that isn't supposed to belong to a girl. ""Lead-in looks like co-regulation,"" they narrated, voice small in the teal. ""Then sympathetic surge. Someone got close. Then she panicked.""


""Or the machine protected the host,"" Reyes said, and it wasn't a correction so much as a hand on the back of the data to keep it from running off a cliff.


On the graph, the double-pulse section was a braid: two lines twining, touching, breaking apart as if the idea of togetherness were more dangerous than the idea of alone. Ari zoomed until pixels showed their seams. ""Same braid as July,"" they said. ""Same as the bus shelter in September.""


""And the same abort,"" Reyes said. She didn't sigh. She didn't have that habit. ""Backtrace the geohash. Quarter-kilometer radius.""


A map tile blossomed from the side panel—streets in tidy gray; the glow settling over Echo & Vine, suburban quiet pretending not to be significant. A block from the Diaz house.


""Halloween rolling into morning,"" Ari said, because the calendar has a sense of theater.


""Myth makes useful camouflage for science,"" Reyes said. She stepped closer to the glow and it painted scalpel light up the inside of her palms. ""Passive polling at ten-second intervals for twenty-four hours. No active ping.""


""Because she spooks easy,"" Ari finished, the words having to be said by someone.


Reyes didn't confirm; she didn't need to. She was still watching the wave settle back into its neat, stubborn cadence, a tick that wouldn't declare allegiance to calm or chaos and so survived both. For a moment, the lab seemed to hear a porch lamp humming from very far away. For a moment, the green line almost matched it.


""Log as **Unit-02, Event Eleven-Oh-One underscore Zero-Oh-Forty-Two**,"" Reyes said. ""Tag it **Entrainment Attempt / Abort**.""


Ari typed with the speed of someone who finds order persuasive. The tag stamped itself into the corner like a verdict. The teal softened. The room remembered the temperature of old coffee.


""Do you think she knows we can see this?"" Ari asked, because someone should put a question like that into a room even if the answer would be a shape instead of a word.


""She knows someone is watching,"" Reyes said, clinical and not unkind. ""She doesn't know who. Yet.""


They stood with the light doing its work on their faces. On the screen, the line held steady: low, resilient, alive. A moth tapped the lab's window and changed its mind.


Reyes reached for the coffee, winced at the cold, drank anyway. ""She's learning to regulate,"" she said, almost to herself. ""That's new.""


Ari nodded, because sometimes the job is just noticing the difference between noise and signal and writing it down before you forget which was which. The spike did not return. The braid unwound into one ordinary line that refused to be ordinary if you knew what you were looking at.


Reyes watched a second longer than habit required, like a woman measuring a door with her eyes. When she finally turned away, it wasn't triumph that underlined her mouth; it was inevitability.


""Found you,"" she said, so soft the monitors had to lean in to hear it.


The teal kept breathing. The lab kept its merciful quiet. Somewhere across the city, a girl in a borrowed hoodie and a boy who should know better slept like a truce, and for tonight, that was enough.

1pmhpwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Williamsan12/comments/1pmhpwh/how_airportassist_makes_vip_travel_seamless_at/,How AirportAssist Makes VIP Travel Seamless at Bangalore Kempegowda International Airport (BLR),"**A quick walk into BLR**

You experience the same thing when you arrive at [Bangalore Kempegowda](https://www.airportassist.com/book/bangalore-airport-assistance-services) International Airport (BLR) in the late afternoon: people are moving steadily, last-mile business travellers are on calls, tourists have huge backpacks, and some very well-dressed people are getting out of the canopy. BLR moves fast. It caters to the tech crowd of the city, visiting executives, diplomats and families going on weekend getaways alike, which translates to one thing to anyone who cares about his or her time: the airport part of the trip should not be the most difficult. The Bangalore Kempegowda International Airport (BLR) has VIP Services. We don't do spectacle. We handle do, make action straight and on schedule and we hold your privacy.

**BLR, what is so in it-**

The terminals of BLR are contemporary and busy; gates are buzzing with connection traffic and the domestic-international division implies that people are in constant transit between terminals. Monday-Friday you'll find founders with headphones, last minute delegates with folders, families with toddlers struggling to keep up. Such a combination forms predictable pinch points, namely, the lines at the security checkpoints during the busiest times, the shuttle between terminals, and the bottlenecks in front of some immigration counters. You do not have to track such patterns but we track them. All the difference between bolstering along and walking lies in a couple of minutes of observation on the curb.

**The answer to the question of why VIP Services at Bangalore Kempegowda International Airport (BLR) are practical, but not trendy is yes.**

Well, to tell the truth, our clients do not need flash as VIP. It is about transforming stress in the airport to productive time. Consider it efficient in an elegant way. Negotiating kiosks, queues, and changing gates are the last things you want when you come after an overnight flight. We greet you, do check-in and luggage logistics and show you priority lanes to ensure your calendar does not plummet. That is the unspoken worth of airport concierge, it is realistic, inconspicuous, and focused on maintaining your momentum.Airport concierge — it’s practical, discreet, and oriented around keeping your momentum.

**Who is the greatest beneficiary the BLR crowd whom we are really assisting.**

Our visitors are not a single type. They are tech CEOs who have two back-to-back meetings, embassy members who must have a secret path, families with small children, and creative teams with their equipment and deadlines. There are those who come with their personal drivers and bookings in a five-star hotel; some people come tired and only wish to find a relaxing corridor to rest. We adapt to each style. The one thing they have in common is that they like time and space to themselves.

**The** [**AirportAssist**](https://www.airportassist.com/book/bangalore-airport-assistance-services) **playbook at BLR - step by step.**

This is the bare uncomplicated reality of what we do. We pick you up at our agreed location, at the curbside, arrivals hall, or transit bridge, with a low-key name board to avoid the embarrassing scanning. Bags are picked up by Porters as we allocate seats and handle concerns of any loyalty program. Where there are priority lanes, we take you through security and immigration; where there are none, we find the least congested path and eliminate the uncertainty. We take you to a lounge or a quiet room to reset and when it is time, we take you to the gate. Consistency: have one small team with the airport bit so that you can do the rest of your day.

**Lounge logic and local partners- in which we literally sit and sleep or work.**

There are a number of quality options in terms of premium lounges available at BLR that are booked out at very regular intervals such as in the early morning business rush, the mid-afternoon domestic banks, and the late evening international arrivals. We make arrangements with lounge teams to get a more comfortable place to work, a power outlet nearby, or a low table to use to take a call. Minor details do count: a nice cup of filter coffee, a plate delivered in a timely manner, a charger at your table. The visit to the lounge is scheduled by us to ensure that you are not dragged at the last minute. That mellow dance move transforms an hour in an airport into something that seems like a nightmare into something that can be used.

**Handovers of chauffeurs and links in the city--how we make exits efficient.**

When getting into a personal car, the process of handover should be smooth, you should not have to be waiting in the sun until drivers stand at their device using traffic applications. We are able to organize pick-up locations and specific curbside areas in order to have your driver where you require him. We tell chauffeurs the quickest way out, and record building or urban side idiosyncrasies that may waste time. When guests are directly going to the high-end hotels or other meetings we make sure that the transfer does not look like a break to the journey but part of it.

**Collective movements & family tours--not anarchy.**

It is not an individual task to transport a family of five or a corporate delegation across BLR. We have additional greeters, baggage handling is staggered and we have definite rendezvous points so that no one goes astray. In the case of families, it could be giving more preference to stroller storage and ensuring children have something to eat before getting on board. In the case of corporate groups, it implies coordinated arrivals so that your entire staff will be there at the meeting. The purpose is peaceful coordination - that silent form which causes traveling to be purposeful.

 

**Moment of crisis situation - close relationships, rebooking and low profile help.**

Life has its way: last minute gate changes, weather hold-ups, flight schedule changes. You must act, not write emails when they occur. We follow up flights in real-time, and communicate with airline and ground crew to rebook, reroute or upgrade when it makes sense. To customers who have mobility requirements or medical escort, we arrange the airport services and medical teams such that they would appear as soon as possible and in the least noise. It is a discretionary working muscle.

**Accessibility & caring service -- mobility, healthcare, and obtrusion.**

Mobility service at BLR is generally a time and a light touch issue. We book wheelchairs, support with the help of stretchers, and medical pick-ups and ensure that we keep it confidential. Our employees are trained to know how to handle delicate scenarios - how to assist an elderly friend going through the immigration process or how to make sure a temporary medical escort is on hand at the gate. Such are not dramatic moments, but very human ones. We treat them like any other VIP booking in the same level of competency.

**Checklist on booking-- what we want and how fast we go.**

In order to establish this we will require the basic details, flight numbers, passenger names as on passport, number of bags, details of the chauffeur when required and any special dietary or mobility requirements. We would like to have a day or two to get the details straight, although we have a 24/7 desk that gets a lot of shorter-notice requests. Once this has been confirmed, we make your itinerary our own: tracking flights, verifying greeters, and remaining available to change. The idea here is to receive fewer messages, and more reliable movement that is not noisy.

**A short, human moment**

At some point, a client had come with his worn out body after an overnight flight, the older friend accompanying him started to stumble during passport checks. Our greeter was left with them in the lounge as we came up with an unobtrusive medical pickup. Afterwards, the client mentioned that it was a whole day that changed after those ten minutes of attention. Such little detail, such ugly and useful stuff, is precisely what we are referring to when we discuss bespoke VIP treatment.

**A short invitation**

The Bangalore Kempegowda International Airport (BLR) is an airport on the move. Airport assist VIP travel services are the logical option to those travellers who are in tight schedules and demand some sort of discretion. We have your day rolling, guard your privacy, and manage the airport, so that you could manage everything. Checking into Bangalore Kempegowda International Airport (BLR) way in advance, [VIP Services](https://www.airportassist.com/book/bangalore-airport-assistance-services) are one of the services that you need to get when you are ready and make the airport a part of your journey.

We started recording ourselves at night to settle the argument. This morning he moved out without saying a word, leaving only a note: “Check the footage alone.”","The first time my roommate mentioned it, I laughed.

“Dude,” he said over breakfast, rubbing his eyes, “you’ve gotta stop doing that.”

“Doing what?” I asked.

“Sitting on my bed at night,” he said. “Just… staring at me.”

I snorted. “I’ve been asleep every night this week. You’re dreaming.”

He didn’t laugh back.

“I know the difference,” he said quietly. “You don’t say anything. You just sit there. Like you’re waiting.”

That should’ve been my first warning.

But when you live with someone long enough, you learn how to dismiss things. Stress. Night terrors. Sleep paralysis. I told him all of that. He nodded like he’d already tried believing it.

The second time, he woke me up.

It was 3:40 AM. He was standing in my doorway, pale, shaking, eyes darting behind me like he expected someone else to be there.

“You were just in my room,” he said.

I checked my phone. I hadn’t moved in hours. Sleep app said I’d been in deep sleep.

“I didn’t leave my bed,” I said.

“You did,” he insisted. “You sat on the edge. Same spot. Same posture. Hands on your knees. You were breathing, but it didn’t sound like you were asleep.”

I sat up. “Did I talk?”

He swallowed. “No. But you smiled when I pretended to wake up.”

That stopped me cold.

We didn’t talk much the rest of the night.

By morning, he’d convinced himself it was stress. Work had been rough. He joked about it. Forced it. I let him. I didn’t want to be the person who feeds someone else’s fear.

The third time happened two nights later.

He didn’t come to me this time.

He texted.

> Are you awake?



I replied instantly.

> Yeah. What’s up?



Three dots.
Stopped.
Started again.

> Then who’s sitting on my bed right now?



My chest tightened.

I jumped out of bed and opened my door.

The hallway was empty.

His door was closed.

Locked.

I knocked hard. “Open up. Now.”

There was silence on the other side.

Then, softly, he said, “You just stood up.”

The door opened a crack.

He was sitting upright in bed, eyes bloodshot, phone clutched in his hand. The room smelled like cold sweat.

“You were right there,” he whispered. “You stood up from the bed and walked out. I heard your footsteps.”

I felt sick.

“I came straight from my room,” I said. “I swear.”

He stared at me for a long time.

Then he said, “We’re recording tonight.”


---

We set up two cameras.

One in the hallway, facing both bedroom doors.

One in his room, angled at the bed.

No blind spots.

No excuses.

We agreed on rules: doors closed, lights off, no alcohol, no sleep meds. Phones charging on our nightstands. No getting up unless it was an emergency.

I slept like a rock.

No dreams. No waking. No gaps in memory.

When I opened my eyes, it was morning.

And my apartment was quiet in a way that felt… wrong.

No coffee brewing.
No footsteps.
No music bleeding through the walls.

I walked into the living room.

My roommate’s shoes were gone.
His jacket was gone.
His backpack — the one he never left without — was missing.

On the kitchen counter sat his phone.

And a folded note.

Just three lines, written fast and uneven:

I didn’t sleep.
I didn’t hallucinate.
Check the footage alone.

My stomach dropped.

I picked up his phone.

No passcode.

The camera app was still open.

Paused.

Timestamp frozen at 3:12 AM.

The exact time he usually said it happened.

My finger hovered over the screen.

Somewhere deep in my chest, something tightened — like an instinct I’d never needed before was suddenly screaming.

Don’t watch it with the lights off.
Don’t watch it more than once.
And whatever you do—

Don’t look at yourself too long.

I pressed play.

The hallway footage played first.

The camera’s night vision washed everything in dull green — doors on either side, carpet stretching toward the living room, nothing moving.

Time stamp ticked forward in silence.

3:10 AM.
3:11 AM.

At 3:12, my bedroom door opened.

I leaned closer to the screen.

The door didn’t creak.
Didn’t hesitate.

It opened smoothly, like whoever was behind it knew exactly how much pressure to use.

I stepped out.

Not groggy.
Not stretching.
Not rubbing my eyes.

Fully upright.

Alert.

I stood in the hallway for a full nine seconds without moving.

Just… standing there.

Watching my roommate’s door.

Then I smiled.

Not wide.
Not friendly.

It was the same neutral smile I give strangers in elevators.

The one I don’t think about.

The one that isn’t for anyone.

I felt my stomach turn.

I hadn’t smiled like that in years.

I watched myself walk toward his room.

No hesitation.
No sound.

I didn’t knock.

I opened his door.

The hallway camera kept running.

My bedroom door stayed open behind me.

The timestamp crawled forward.

3:13.
3:14.

I didn’t come back out.

I swallowed hard and switched to the camera inside his room.

The angle showed the foot of the bed, part of the wall, his dresser. He was asleep when the footage started — curled on his side, breathing heavy.

Then, from the left side of the frame…

I entered.

Slowly.

I sat on the edge of his bed exactly where he said I did.

Hands on knees.

Back straight.

Head tilted just slightly downward so my face stayed in shadow.

I sat there for four minutes.

Not moving.

Not blinking.

My roommate stirred.

Shifted.

Muttered something under his breath.

I leaned forward.

The movement was subtle — deliberate — like I didn’t want to wake him too fast.

His eyes opened.

Even through night vision, I could see the fear hit him instantly.

He didn’t scream.

He didn’t speak.

He just froze.

I raised one finger to my lips.

A shushing gesture.

I felt cold all over.

Then I did something I’ve never done in my life.

I reached out and gently placed my hand on his ankle.

He flinched violently.

Pulled away.

I smiled again.

And then I turned my head—

Directly toward the camera.

Toward me.

The footage glitched.

Just for a split second.

When it stabilized, I was standing.

My roommate was sitting upright now, clutching his blanket, eyes locked on me.

I leaned down close to his face.

The camera didn’t pick up sound.

But I could read my own lips.

“Don’t wake up yet.”

Then I stood and walked toward the door.

The hallway camera caught me leaving his room at 3:18 AM.

I walked back to my bedroom.

Stepped inside.

Closed the door.

At 3:19, the hallway was empty again.

No shadows.
No movement.

Just doors.

Just silence.

My chest felt tight.

I rewound the footage.

Watched it again.

Then again.

On the third watch, I noticed something I’d missed before.

When I left my bedroom the first time…

My reflection in the hallway mirror didn’t move with me.

It stayed behind.

Standing in the doorway.

Watching my body walk away.

Smiling.

I slammed the phone down.

My hands were shaking.

I looked around my apartment.

Everything was normal.

Too normal.

I checked my phone — my sleep tracker showed deep sleep from 12:47 AM to 6:22 AM.

No interruptions.

No movement.

No waking.

I went back to the footage one last time.

Paused it at 3:12 AM.

Right before my door opened.

I leaned in.

And that’s when I saw it.

My bedroom door opens before the timestamp changes.

By about two seconds.

Meaning the camera registered the movement…

Before the time existed to record it.

I didn’t sleep that night.

At 3:11 AM, I sat on my bed, fully awake, staring at my door.

At 3:12, the handle turned.

Slowly.

From the inside.

And from the other side of the door, my voice whispered:

“Don’t worry.
I already went.”

I didn’t open the door.

I couldn’t.

My hand hovered inches from the handle while my own voice breathed on the other side, calm and patient, like it had all the time in the world.

“I already went,” it repeated softly. “You don’t need to check.”

The handle stopped turning.

Not because it gave up.

Because it was listening.

I backed away slowly, every step deliberate, terrified that sudden movement might… correct something.

The whisper followed me.

“You always do this,” it said. “You hesitate. Then you pretend it didn’t happen.”

I ended up sitting on my bed, knees drawn up, staring at the door until the sun came up. When daylight finally filled the room, the fear didn’t fade. It just thinned out, like fog that never quite burns off.

The door never opened.

But when I checked the hallway camera again at noon, the footage from 3:12 AM was gone.

Not corrupted.

Not deleted.

Gone — like the file had never existed.

Except for one thing.

A single thumbnail remained in the camera roll.

No timestamp.
No duration.

Just a still image.

My bedroom door, slightly open.

And someone standing inside.

Facing the camera.

Too dark to make out details.

But I knew that posture.

I closed the app and shoved the phone into a drawer.

I told myself I wouldn’t look again.

That lasted until night.


---

I didn’t sleep.

I lay in bed, lights on, door open, phone face-down on the nightstand. Every sound felt amplified — pipes knocking, the fridge cycling, the faint hum of the building settling.

At 3:08 AM, my phone buzzed.

I didn’t touch it.

Another buzz.

Then another.

Finally, I flipped it over.

No notifications.

No missed calls.

Just the camera app, open by itself.

Live view.

Hallway feed.

My bedroom door was closed.

My roommate’s room was empty now — stripped bare, like no one had ever lived there.

The timestamp rolled forward.

3:11 AM.

I sat up.

The camera view didn’t change.

But something felt… off.

Like the room was holding its breath.

3:12 AM.

My bedroom door didn’t open.

Instead, the camera image zoomed in.

Not digitally.

Physically.

Like someone had picked up the camera and leaned closer to my door.

I grabbed my phone with shaking hands.

“What do you want?” I whispered.

The phone vibrated once.

A message appeared.

No sender.

> You keep waking up in the wrong place.



The hallway feed flickered.

For a single frame, my door was gone.

In its place was a dark opening — deeper than my room should be, stretching back into something that didn’t look like an apartment at all.

Then the image snapped back.

Door closed.

Normal.

My phone buzzed again.

> He didn’t leave because of me.
He left because he saw where I come from.



I swallowed hard.

“Where?” I whispered.

The reply took longer this time.

> Behind your eyes.



My reflection appeared on the black screen of my phone.

I hadn’t turned the camera around.

It just… showed up.

My face stared back at me.

Eyes open.

Unblinking.

But my mouth moved.

“You’re awake now,” it said silently.

The lights in my room dimmed.

I felt pressure at the edge of the bed.

Not weight.

Intent.

Something sat down.

The mattress dipped.

Slowly.

Carefully.

Exactly the way I had seen myself do in the footage.

I didn’t look.

I couldn’t.

My phone buzzed one last time.

> If you stay awake, you stay you.
But you can’t stay awake forever.



The pressure beside me shifted.

Closer.

I felt breath on my neck.

Not warm.

Not cold.

Familiar.

Behind me, my own voice whispered:

“Just rest.
I’ll sit for you tonight.”

I didn’t sleep.

I don’t mean I tried not to.
I mean I physically could not.

Every time my eyes closed for more than a second, the pressure on the mattress beside me increased — not heavier, just more present, like something leaning in to see if I was gone yet.

“I’m still awake,” I whispered.

Beside me, my voice replied softly:

“I know.”

The lights stayed on all night.
The door stayed open.
Nothing moved.

At 6:41 AM, the pressure lifted.

I didn’t move until the sun was fully up.

When I finally stood, my legs shook so badly I had to grab the dresser. The bed was smooth. Undisturbed. No indentation where something had sat for hours.

I checked the cameras.

Every file from the previous night was gone.

Not deleted.

Not corrupted.

Gone.

Except for one new clip.

Duration: 2 hours, 48 minutes
Timestamp: 3:12 AM – 6:00 AM
Camera: Bedroom

I stared at the screen.

My thumb hovered.

I almost didn’t watch it.

I should’ve stopped there.

I pressed play.


---

The footage showed my bedroom.

Lights on.
Door open.
Me sitting upright in bed, staring forward.

Awake.

Still.

At 3:14, something moved at the edge of the frame.

It stepped out of the darkness beside the bed.

Me.

But not standing.

Not walking.

Unfolding.

Like it had been compressed into the space beside me and was finally stretching out.

It sat on the edge of the mattress.

Facing me.

Facing itself.

We sat there together for a long time.

At 3:29, my body in bed slumped slightly.

Just a fraction.

The other one leaned closer.

At 3:47, it raised a hand.

Not touching.

Hovering inches from my face.

Like it was waiting for permission.

At 4:02, my eyes finally closed.

The moment they did, the thing smiled.

Wide.

Relieved.

It stood.

And I—
my body—
did not.

The thing leaned down and whispered something into my sleeping ear.

Then it lay down in my place.

Pulled the blanket up.

At 4:05, it turned its head toward the camera.

And mouthed words I didn’t need audio to understand.

“Thank you.”

The screen cut to black.


---

I vomited in the sink.

I didn’t go to work.

I didn’t call my roommate.

I packed a bag and left the apartment by noon.

I thought distance would help.

It didn’t.

Because wherever I went, people looked at me strangely — not confused, not scared.

Familiar.

Like they’d already met me earlier.

A barista asked if I’d changed my mind about oat milk.

A stranger waved and said, “Rough night?”

I checked my phone.

Messages I didn’t send.

Calls I didn’t remember making.

Photos taken from angles I never use.

All timestamped between 3:12 and 6:00 AM.

Last night.

And the night before.

And the one before that.

It wasn’t taking me all at once.

It was rotating.

Letting me exist during the day.

Letting it exist at night.

Sharing.

Practicing.

That night, in a motel room three towns away, I barricaded the door and stayed awake as long as I could.

At 3:11 AM, my phone buzzed.

One message.

No sender.

> You don’t have to watch anymore.
We’ve got the rhythm now.



At 3:12, exhaustion finally won.

Just for a second.

Just a blink.

And in that blink, I felt it —
the smooth, familiar motion of someone sitting on the edge of the bed.

Patient.

Careful.

Like they’d done this hundreds of times already.

I don’t know how long I’ll still be the one typing during the day.

But if you ever wake up and see someone you know sitting quietly at the edge of your bed—

Don’t scream.

Don’t move.

And whatever you do—

Don’t fall back asleep.

Because if you do…

You might wake up believing you were the one who left.",1,1765728623.0,u_NightmareNarratives-,0,1.0,False

Need opinions,"I recently got divorced and moved out of my ex-husband’s place (it was originally his parents’ home that he inherited). It was a tough chapter, but honestly, I’m feeling really good about starting fresh.

I’ve rented a small unfurnished apartment and picked up the basics, and for the first time in a long while, I get to decorate without compromising or arguing over every little thing. That part has been surprisingly freeing.

I just bought a light-colored L-shaped couch that I love, and now I’m looking for a coffee table. I came across a travertine one (from Travertable) that fits the vibe I’m going for really well. The only hesitation I have is that a friend mentioned travertine tables can be pretty heavy and annoying to vacuum around.

So now I’m torn, whether it's worth going for something like travertine for the look and feel, or should I play it safe with a more traditional glass coffee table? Curious what others would do.",1,1765728618.0,femalelivingspace,0,1.0,False

1pmhllc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pmhllc/aitah_for_dumping_my_bf/,AITAH for dumping my bf?,"soo, i(36f) started talking to this guy(30m). we met at school, we started communicating via text at first. and kinda after a few days of just talking as friends he says that he wants to keep our friendship on the DL… like???? okay?? when i asked him why, he said it was bc he was friends with other women at our school and people assumed that they were dating, and he didn’t want people to think that of us. like, okay whatever not really a big deal imo. as we continued talking for about a month or so i did start to develop feelings for him and he just outright asked if i had a crush on him. i didn’t lie, and told him the truth and ask if he felt the same. he said yes. now from there we hadn’t made our relationship official or anything we were still just talking. and he was already starting to talk about marriage and spending the rest of our lives together… and that’s where i needed to stop him, or rather asked him to slow down. bc he knew that i had a kid, he knew that i was in school(it’s where we met), and knew that i worked. and on top of all that, i hadn’t been in a relationship in over 7yrs. i needed time to get used to juggling everything in my life and trying to make time for everything. honestly, i was already struggling after adding school into the equation. so, i explained this to him and asked him to please take things slow. he kinda gave a response like, “idk how to but i’ll try.” like okayy?? soo, a week later he’s talking as if we were in relationship at this point, we weren’t. i mentioned this, so he officially asks and i say yes. as the time went on he would lovebomb me quite a bit, and would constantly use pet names and say he adores me. i had to tell him that i don’t typically use pet names, but i was trying for him.(calling people baby is just weird to be bc i have a baby and that seemed like the one he preferred me to use bc he would ask me to call him “my baby.”) so, i would try other ones like bae, or babe. but considering we just barely started dating and i felt like i didn’t know him very well, it was tougher for me to just use pet names like that. but when he would ask me to, i always did. like i am struggling rn bc my last few relationships i rarely used pet names or compliments(only when it felt warranted. idk that’s just how i am and i was working on that.) he was constantly getting depressed and would feel like a failure and loser bc he was in school and not finished yet, and would threaten to drop out n shit. so, i was always having to console him, be supportive and help him through it. and this happened almost weekly… but i understood to a point and was trying to help. i would buy him coffee and stuff and never expect anything in return. i invited him to hang out with my friends and family, and to play video games with me. and i even would go to school early on days i knew he would be there just to see him. we went from seeing each other multiple times a week, to maybe once or twice a week.(bc our school schedules changed and we lived an hour and a half away from each each other.) which was fine bc i expected this time happened, i helped him get a new job and we were both pretty busy. so, on days we had time i would always try to at least play games with him online. whenever we played games or hung out irl, i’d always ask him what he wanted to do and it was always, “idc.” soo, i just made those decisions… as the time went on our conversations became nonexistent, we still texted daily but it was mostly just us saying we miss each other and that he wanted photos of me. i would try to ask him other things but i would get one worded answers (for the most part.) things became stagnant bc i barely saw him and we didn’t really have meaningful conversations. i was the only one inviting him to hangout and when we did hang out he would barely talk to me. like after awhile i felt like i was just talking to myself, so i would just stop. i was starting to feel like the only reason he care about me was for my appearance bc that’s the only thing he would ever bring up… so, i told him that’s how i was feeling and that it was feeling forced when he would ask me to call him baby and for my bday he got me a gift and it felt odd bc i’d never shown interest in this particular item but he made a comment that he always wanted one. and that comment kinda ruined the gift for me. so, i told him all this and he sent me like a bunch of paragraphs saying that wasn’t true, that he was worried about our sex life but he was wrong about that, and that he adores me etc etc. it was a lot. and i was like, okay, well that’s just how it was feeling. i even mentioned how it felt like he didn’t initiate conversations or hanging out and then he asks me what i’m doing this saturday.. /: like okay i’ll give you that, idk… i thought things were okay but then he wanted to talk on the phone, we both work and don’t have time to talk during. but our hours are vastly different. i wake up and 5am every morning for work, and struggle with getting enough sleep every night so i try to go to bed as early as i can bc i do drive for my job and not being tired all day is important. he knows this, but he was getting off work at like 9pm and was wanting to have a long ass conversation that i just did not have the energy for, i asked him if we could please do this on a night were i could stay up and it not be an issue. he was kinda like “whatever.” and tried the next day, unfortunately my child decided to drop some information on me last minute that i needed to get completely that night. i had a long day at work and school and came home to having to deal with kid stuff for her school, i was overwhelmed and exhausted. he called around 9pm again and tried to talk, i explained to him what i was doing and he became silent. i tried to talk to him about what i was doing but nothing. i got frustrated and was just like let’s do this tomorrow. and he was just like “whatever.” the next day rolls around and i get this long ass text from him, where essentially he says that he feels like i hate him, feels like i treat him like shit and that i use our relationship being new as an excuse to do so and that i am trying to change him. he said that what i said the other day about me feeling like he only liked me for my appearance, and that it felt like he wanted me to do things out of my comfort zone felt forced, and that he never initiates anything with me was reversed…. but it was also sprinkled with him saying he adores me and wants to work on this and fix things etcetc. at this point i’m beyond frustrated bc how tf do you feel like i hate you and treat you like shit??? how tf am i trying to change you when all i’ve EVER asked of you was to slow down?? and had to do so, MULTIPLE TIMES. i asked him what i did to make him feel this way and he wouldn’t just tell me, he wanted to do it over the phone bc he felt like i was misinterpreting his words. like idk how you can misinterpret “i genuinely think you hate who i am, you use our relationship being fresh as an excuse to treat me like shit.” THOSE WERE HIS EXACT WORDS. now mind you, phone calls are not my preferred method of contact, i will do it when i have the energy to do it but now i am starting to get upset and angry and the last thing i want to do is start crying and yelling. so, i kept asking him what i did to make him feel that way, and millions of paragraphs and hours later he finally tells me the reason he thinks i hate him is bc i don’t use pet names that often or compliments him. like I NEVER SEE YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, and i was working on the pet name thing. BUT apparently me asking him to slow down means i am trying to change him, and me not using pet names all the time means that i hate him. when he was the only person i talked to daily, when i’ve been the only one to invite him to hangout with me and my friends and family, he never once tried to do the same. i would go out of my way to try to see him and he never did the same for me. i would buy him stuff and never expect anything in return. he never did the same for me, except for my bday. soo, i was getting frustrated at how he could feel like this when i felt like i was doing so much to make him feel included in my life, and having to constantly pick him up when he felt down, and to constantly have to inflate his ego to feel better.. apparently none of that mattered… all bc i wasn’t using pet names all the time and bc i asked him to take things slow…

so, i ended it. i was tired of having to constantly explain why i am the way that i am, bc i am neurodivergent, but i was still trying to do things just for him to make him feel better. despite me not feeling comfortable doing so. but it was never enough for him bc he felt that i hated him and treated him like shit…. am i wrong??",0,1765728368.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

I work with non-native professionals every day, and the same complaint comes up constantly: ""People keep asking me to repeat myself, even though my grammar is fine.""

Here's what nobody tells you upfront.

**The problem with unclear enunciation:**

To get better at enunciation, you have to start by becoming an honest listener of your own voice. It sounds simple, but this is the step most people skip.

It involves recording yourself speaking and then playing it back to catch the specific habits—like slurring words or talking a mile a minute—that are holding you back.

I see this constantly: accomplished professionals who've been told to ""speak more clearly"" but have no idea what specifically they're doing wrong. They try generic tongue twisters or speak louder, when the real issue is dropped consonants or rushing through key words.

Without this self-assessment, any exercises are just guesswork.

**What clear enunciation actually requires:**

Improving enunciation isn't about running through generic tongue twisters. It's about targeted, focused practice on your unique challenges.

The best way to do this is to create a personal ""sound inventory""—a practical map of your specific speaking patterns.

**Step 1: Record yourself (the foundation):**

Find a quiet spot, pull out your smartphone, and open the voice memo app. Record yourself talking for just two or three minutes.

The key here is not to read from a script. Just talk naturally about your day, a project you're working on, or a movie you just saw. You want to capture how you really sound in everyday conversation.

**What to listen for:**

Now, play it back. Your job is to be a detective, not a judge. You're just gathering data, so leave any self-criticism at the door.

**Dropped consonants:** Do you say ""goin'"" instead of ""going,"" or ""firs'"" instead of ""first""? Those final consonants, especially 'T', 'D', and 'G', are often the first casualties when we speak quickly.

**Slurred sounds:** Do certain words melt into each other? For instance, does ""did you eat yet?"" come out sounding more like ""jeet-jet""? This is incredibly common.

**Pacing and speed:** Pinpoint any moments where you start speeding up. People who are passionate about a topic often accelerate without realizing it, sacrificing clarity along the way.

**Vowel clarity:** Are your vowel sounds crisp and distinct? Can a listener easily tell the difference between words like ""sit"" and ""seat,"" or ""cot"" and ""caught"" when you say them?

This exercise isn't about finding flaws. It's about gathering intelligence. Once you have this inventory, you can stop guessing what the problem is and start focusing your energy where it will make a real difference.

**Building your personal sound inventory:**

As you listen, grab a notebook or open a doc and jot down what you hear. The more specific, the better.

Don't just write ""I mumble."" Instead, write, ""I tend to drop the final 'T' sound on words like 'don't' and 'can't'.""

That level of detail is what turns a vague goal into a concrete, actionable plan.

**Common enunciation pitfalls:**

|Problem|Cause|Quick Fix|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mumbling/slurring|Speaking too quickly, insufficient mouth movement|Intentionally exaggerate lip and jaw movements|
|Dropping word endings|Rushing to the next word|Consciously ""land"" the final consonant|
|Speaking too fast|Nerves, excitement, thinking faster than speaking|Practice shorter phrases with brief pauses|
|""Mushy"" vowels|Lazy tongue/lip positioning|Open mouth slightly wider than feels natural|
|Weak consonants|Insufficient airflow or contact|Focus on crisp, sharp P, T, K sounds|

**Key insight:** By isolating your specific challenges, you ensure that every practice drill you perform is directly solving a problem. This targeted approach is the fastest way to build new muscle memory for clearer, more confident speech.

**Step 2: Warm up your speech muscles (the physical foundation):**

Think of an athlete stretching before a race. Now, apply that same logic to speaking. Before any important conversation or presentation, you need to warm up your articulators—that's the jaw, lips, and tongue.

When you find yourself mumbling or slurring words, it's usually not because you don't know what to say. It's a physical issue. Your speech muscles are either too tense or too sluggish to form sounds with the precision they need.

**Release jaw tension (the #1 culprit):**

A tight jaw is one of the biggest culprits behind mumbling. When your jaw is tense, your mouth doesn't open enough to let sounds out properly, leaving them trapped and muffled.

**The big yawn:** Open your mouth as wide as you comfortably can, like you're in the middle of a huge yawn. Hold it for 5-10 seconds and really feel that stretch.

**Side-to-side slide:** Gently move your lower jaw from left to right. Don't force anything; the movement should be smooth and easy.

**Massage the hinge:** Place your fingertips on your temporomandibular joints (TMJ), right in front of your ears. As you slowly open and close your mouth, apply gentle pressure and massage in a circular motion.

By consciously relaxing your jaw, you're not just preparing to speak better—you're breaking a physical habit that directly causes unclear speech.

**Build tongue agility:**

Your tongue is an incredibly nimble muscle, but it can get lazy. To produce sharp, distinct consonant sounds like T, D, L, and R, your tongue has to move with speed and precision.

**Tongue push-ups:** Press the tip of your tongue firmly against the ridge behind your top front teeth. Then, press it against the back of your bottom front teeth. Repeat 10 times.

**Around the world:** Slowly and deliberately, trace the entire outer surface of your teeth with the tip of your tongue. Go clockwise, then counter-clockwise.

**Point and stretch:** Stick your tongue straight out and try to touch your nose, then your chin. Hold each stretch for a few seconds.

**Activate your lips:**

Crisp vowel sounds and consonants like P, B, and M are impossible without the right lip shape and movement.

**Lip trills (lip buzz):** Press your lips together loosely and blow air through them to create a buzzing or motorboat sound. This relaxes the lips and helps you regulate your airflow.

**Five-minute pre-meeting warm-up:**

|Exercise|Duration|Purpose|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jaw massage|1 minute|Release tension that causes mumbling|
|Lip trills|1 minute|Activate lips and control breath|
|Tongue stretches|2 minutes|Build precision for sharp consonants|
|Smile and pucker|1 minute|Improve lip flexibility for vowels|

This little routine primes your speech muscles, making sure that when you start talking, your words come out sharp, clear, and effortless.

**Step 3: Practice drills for lasting diction:**

With your speech muscles warmed up, it's time to get into focused training. This is where you build the muscle memory that translates directly into real-world clarity.

**Target problem consonants:**

Some consonants are just plain tricky. They demand very specific placement of your tongue, lips, and teeth.

The goal here isn't speed; it's deliberate, slow repetition. Focus entirely on the physical sensation of making the sound correctly.

**For the 'TH' sound:** *Thousand, theory, thank, thoughtful, through*

* Feel the tip of your tongue gently touching the back of your top front teeth. It's a light touch, not a hard press.

**For the 'L' sound:** *Listen, literally, loyal, allow, feeling*

* Make sure the tip of your tongue firmly presses against that ridge right behind your top teeth.

**For the 'R' sound:** *Around, rural, library, bring, correct*

* Lift the middle of your tongue toward the roof of your mouth, but make sure the tip doesn't touch anything.

This kind of focused repetition is literally building new neural pathways. You're teaching your mouth how to create these sounds accurately and automatically.

**Master minimal pairs for vowel precision:**

One of the most powerful techniques for refining your speech is practicing with minimal pairs. These are pairs of words that are almost identical, differing by only a single sound—usually a vowel.

Classic examples:

* *ship* vs. *sheep*
* *sit* vs. *seat*
* *live* vs. *leave*

This drill forces your ear to tune into the subtle differences between sounds, which in turn trains your mouth to produce them more accurately.

**Use over-articulation to build precision:**

This technique will feel strange at first, but it's a secret weapon used by actors and public speakers everywhere.

Over-articulation is exactly what it sounds like: deliberately exaggerating your mouth movements as you speak. You'll open your jaw wider, stretch your lips further, and make your tongue movements way more pronounced than you ever would normally.

**How to practice:**

1. Grab a short text (a paragraph from a book or news article)
2. Read it aloud slowly, over-enunciating every single syllable
3. Feel the stretch in your jaw, lips, and tongue—you should feel them working harder than usual
4. Go back to normal—read the same passage again in your normal speaking voice

The difference is immediate. Your speech will feel more effortless and sound significantly crisper.

This exercise is like lifting heavier weights at the gym; when you go back to your normal weight, it feels much lighter.

**Step 4: Control your pacing and rhythm:**

Great enunciation isn't just about shaping sounds correctly; it's about delivering them with a sense of control.

I've seen it countless times: a speaker has perfect articulation, but their words are a blur because they're rushing. Speeding through your sentences is the fastest way to become unintelligible.

**Slow down without sounding unnatural:**

The secret isn't to drag out your words, but to get comfortable with pauses and phrasing. You're aiming for a deliberate, measured pace that communicates thoughtfulness and authority.

Instead of rushing through this:

""We need to analyze the quarterly sales data to identify key trends before our meeting on Friday so we're prepared for the executive review.""

Try delivering it with strategic pauses:

""We need to analyze the quarterly sales data // to identify key trends // before our meeting on Friday // so we're prepared for the executive review.""

Each pause is a micro-moment. It lets your articulators reset for the next phrase and, just as importantly, gives your listener a split second to process what you just said.

**The power of the strategic pause:**

Pauses are the punctuation of spoken language. They do more than just slow you down—they add weight, create suspense, and put a spotlight on your most important points.

A well-placed pause is a non-verbal cue to your audience that says, ""Listen closely. This next part really matters.""

Rushing your speech often signals anxiety or a lack of confidence. In contrast, comfortable silence conveys authority and shows you are in complete control of your message.

**Find the natural rhythm of English:**

English is a stress-timed language. This means some syllables and words get more emphasis than others, which is what creates its distinct rhythm.

Generally, content words (like nouns, verbs, and adjectives) are stressed, while function words (like articles and prepositions) are unstressed.

Take this simple sentence: ""Dogs chase cats."" The rhythm comes from hitting those three key words.

Now, look at this one: ""The dogs will chase the cats."" Even with the extra unstressed words, the core rhythm is exactly the same.

To start improving your own rhythm, begin by identifying the single most important keyword in each of your sentences. Then, give that word just a little extra emphasis.

**Step 5: Use modern tools for faster progress:**

Practicing enunciation drills in a vacuum can feel like pure guesswork. Are you actually getting better, or just cementing the same old mistakes?

**Leverage automatic speech recognition:**

The speech-to-text or voice command function on your phone is an incredible, real-time diagnostic tool. It transcribes exactly what it hears, not what you think you're saying.

Try dictating this into your phone's notes app: ""The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday.""

Did it come out as ""The dirty tree thieves taught…""? If so, you've just received instant, specific feedback on your 'TH' sound.

This simple trick turns every text message or voice search into a mini-enunciation drill.

**Create a record and review loop:**

The voice memo app is your go-to for deeper analysis. The simple act of recording yourself and listening back closes the painful gap between how you sound inside your head and how you actually sound to everyone else.

Start by recording yourself reading a short paragraph. When you listen back (preferably with headphones), become a detective.

Don't try to fix everything at once. One day, listen only for dropped final consonants. The next, focus exclusively on your pacing.

This targeted listening makes the feedback loop much more effective.

**Comparison of practice tools:**

|Tool Type|Primary Function|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Speech-to-text|Instant transcription|Quick, real-time checks on clarity|
|Voice memo apps|Recording and playback|Deeper analysis of pacing and flow|
|Specialized apps|Structured drills|Guided practice with targeted exercises|
|Video recording|Visual feedback|Assessing physical articulation|

**The practical takeaway:**

Clear enunciation comes from targeted practice on your specific challenges, not generic exercises.

The complete system:

1. **Record yourself (2-3 minutes)** \- Talk naturally, identify specific problems
2. **Warm up daily (5 minutes)** \- Jaw massage, lip trills, tongue stretches
3. **Practice drills (5-10 minutes)** \- Target problem consonants, minimal pairs, over-articulation
4. **Control pacing** \- Use strategic pauses, find natural rhythm
5. **Use technology** \- Speech-to-text for instant feedback, voice memos for analysis

Daily routine (10-15 minutes total):

* Jaw/tongue/lip warm-up (5 minutes)
* Targeted sound practice (5 minutes)
* Record and review once weekly (3 minutes)

**What to ignore:**

The idea that you need to speak loudly or slowly to be clear. Volume and speed aren't the problem—precision is.

Also ignore generic tongue twisters that don't target your specific challenges. If you struggle with 'TH' sounds, practicing 'R' sounds won't help.

**Common questions:**

""How long does it take to see results?"" → Many people feel a difference in their own speech within a few weeks of consistent daily practice (10-15 minutes). The real turning point is when other people start to notice, which often happens within a couple of months.

""Will I sound fake or robotic?"" → No. Over-articulation exercises are a workout, not the final product. The new muscle memory integrates seamlessly into your natural speaking style.

""What if I forget to enunciate during real conversations?"" → Start small. Focus on speaking with deliberate clarity during one low-stakes moment each day (ordering coffee, leaving a voicemail). Use physical cues (colored dot on your monitor) as reminders.

""Can technology really help?"" → Absolutely. AI-powered speech tech can pinpoint specific sounds and patterns you might not notice yourself, turning a subjective goal into something you can measure and track.

**The uncomfortable reality:**

You cannot improve what you do not measure. Recording yourself provides the essential data you need to guide your practice and celebrate your progress.

Most people never actually listen to their own voice, so they keep practicing the wrong things for months without realizing it.

The breakthrough comes when you become an honest listener of your own speech, identify your specific challenges, and practice targeted drills that directly solve those problems.

This is foundational work. Get your enunciation right, and everything else in your communication—confidence, authority, impact—becomes easier.",1,1765728141.0,intonetic,0,1.0,False
1pmhi6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALevelEnglishLit/comments/1pmhi6a/coursework_help/,Coursework help,"So I have my coursework due in in a couple days and because my teacher gave us basically no time after our first draft. She’s not told us anything and says she can’t mark it so I am really panicking about handing in my essay as I really don’t know if there’s anything majorly wrong with it or if I need to change anything. The question is “Discuss in detail how Eliot conveys loneliness and disillusionment in this extract from ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"", considering how characteristic this is of his style and concerns in Eliot’s Selected Poems as a whole.” And we have 1000 words to do it in. Here’s my current essay and if anyone is willing to spare the time could you please let me know any tips to help me get a good result(b+) as I’m really stressed thx         

In this excerpt from “the Love song of J.Alfred.Prufrock”,T.S.Eliot conveys loneliness and disillusionment through the internal ramblings of the character “Prufrock” that we follow throughout the poem. We see his fragmented thought patterns, self conscious language and melancholic tone throughout the excerpt and the poem as a whole that sets a very depressing tone and helps convey the feelings in question well. This extract is also ridden with large amounts of repetition of rhetorical questions which indicate Prufrock’s indecision and social anxiety, which is then paired with huge quantities of mundane imagery that emphasize the monotony and emptiness of his existence. These techniques, couples with free verse and enjambment to mirror Prufrock's jagged and disjointed stream of consciousness, are present not only in the extract and prufrock as a whole, but also in much of Eliot's other works, with the Wasteland and Gerontion being notable examples. Overall this extract cleverly uses a variety of techniques to convey loneliness and disillusionment in “prufrock” and much of the rest of Eliot's works as a whole.

One way in which loneliness and disillusionment are conveyed in this extract through prufrock is with language. Eliot uses a variety of language techniques to demonstrate these ideas, firstly being the use of 	repetition of rhetorical questions. We see this with the repetition of “do I dare” and “do I dare disturb the universe”. The Rhetorical questions presented here on their own already indicate a sense of internal doubt and questioning, however with the added repetition, Eliot has been able to craft an undeniable sense of internal indecision and social anxiety, as Prufrock is evidently spiralling, worrying about whether he is merely allowed to impact the world around him. We see this again with the repetition of “how should I presume” at the end of multiple stanzas later in the poem which further solidifies this sense of overthinking and repeated self doubt and questioning. Another way in which Eliot uses language is to present the mundane. We see this perfectly in the metaphor ""I have measured my life with coffee spoons”. This very apparent mundane imagery is able to further emphasize the monotony and emptiness that prufrock feels inside, and this quote does so perfectly by outlining a monotonous, pointless task that serves only to break himself down into smaller pieces. The use of these mundane objects as well create a reflection of Prufrock's internal dissatisfaction, as despite there being a plethora of objects around him he could cast his metaphors onto, he instead seeks out the most uninteresting and dull item that in doing so reflects him internally. We also see Eliot use language to present loneliness and disillusionment in other texts as well. Take the poem Gerontion, in which Eliot presents these feelings very similarly, that being through the vessel of a character, but in this case it is the little old man, Gerontion, who states “I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch;/How should i use it for your closer contact”. In this case he presents alienation and disconnection in more of a literal sense in that Gerontion feels as his body has degraded he has become physically separated from society is is now barred from “closer contact” in the same way as Prufrock is, however in his case his barrier is his own social paralysis. Overall, Eliot uses language in Prufrock and other poems to convey loneliness and disillusionment through the vessel of his characters. 

Another way in which Eliot has created loneliness and disillusionment is through the use of form and structure. Eliot uses many tools, such as free verse and enjambment to a very fragmented structure. We see this in the extract with “and indeed there will be time/to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet”. Eliot cleverly uses enjambement here, cutting the sentence in half at an unconventional point to create a disjointed flow when the reader is reading the poem that would indicate to the fragmented and disjointed nature of Prufrock's own mind, and how even within himself he is broken apart and lonely. It indicates Prufrock's unsteady train of thought amd uneven flow of consciousness Eliot also uses this technique in some of his other texts, such as the waste land. In this, we see enjambement used with “a crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many / I had not thought death had undone so many”. Within the context of the wasteland, this fragmentation is less of an individual person and more of society as a whole, particularly following the war which had a major effect on all of Eliot's work, and the social fragmentation that eliot felt and believed was representative of the whole population following the war, as a result of huge amounts of death, collapse of religion and other social pillars and a breakdown of societal norms, which eliot saw as a move for the worse. Overall, Eliot uses form, particularly enjambment to create fragmentation that reinforces individual loneliness and societal disillusionment throughout his poems

One more way in which Eliot conveys loneliness and disillusionment is with tone and mood. In Prufrock particularly but also in many other poems, Eliot uses a very strong melancholic tone and bleak imagery to create a mood of loneliness and existential disillusionment. One place in which we see this anxious, melancholic, reflective tone is with the imagery of reaching old age, as seen with “with a bald spot in the middle of my hair - (they will say : “how his hair is growing thin!”)”By portraying an apparent reaching of old age, Eliot creates a tone of melancholy and reflectiveness, as we see Prufrock looking back and feeling that his best days are behind him, and that his body has already begun to deteriorate despite that fact that he is barely middle aged. This sets a bleak tone that further emphasises the misery and pessimism that prufrock feels so strongly. We also see tone used in this manner later in the poem with “I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think they will sing to me”. This is another great use of melancholic language, as it is an example of Eliot introducing something that is beautiful and wondrous, and then putting it out of reach to create a harsh contrast and further illustrate how his characters are isolated from beauty and joy. This contrast also creates a very melancholy tone, as we see the sadness and tragedy in missing out in such beauty and splendour. Overall, Eliot uses tone to illustrate the bleak disillusionment of Prufrock's mind and to create the melancholy and sadness that Prufrock feels in the reader. 


Overall, Eliot conveys loneliness and disillusionment expertly by using his characters as vessels to illustrate this with a variety of methods. These included language, which was able to help the reader visualise the inner working of Prufrock's mind and the deep rooted misery he feels, structure, which helped create a jagged, fractured flow of text that was able to illustrate broken steams on consciousness and fractured society, the loneliness within one's mind and also as part of society, and finally tone, which sets the mood and gets the reader to truly feel the sense of loneliness and disillusionment that Eliot is seeking to project.

1pmhhl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1pmhhl9/godslayer_32_behind_the_clock/,Godslayer - 32: Behind The Clock," The cell was quiet and Freya was alone, laying on her cot and staring up at the ceiling. She didn’t know exactly what fate currently awaited her. Prison? Execution? Something else? She didn’t know what had become of the others, Mason, Cedar, Cassandra, Victor. Were they still alive? Mason and Cassandra probably were. Victor, Vi, Tetra, Cedar and Noah, she couldn’t be sure. She was all but certain both Jean and Luna were dead. 

She closed her eyes. This hell didn’t feel real yet. Her swords had been confiscated. She’d tried to get a look at the locks but without any tools or equipment, there wasn’t much she could do but sit and wait for whatever happened next.

She heard footsteps outside of her cell and didn’t bother looking up. They stopped just by her door, and for a moment Freya wondered if they were coming to collect her. She hadn’t expected to be picked up that fast. She’d only been locked up for a few hours at most.

   “Tetra, this one.”

Tetra?  
	

Freya looked up as the door clicked, then opened. She was greeted by the sight of a familiar face in a stolen guards outfit. 

   “Luna?” She asked, in complete disbelief.

   “Miss me?” Luna asked, “Come on. We’re getting you the hell out of here.”

Freya didn’t need to be told twice. She stepped out of her cell, before looking around. The featureless white hallway she was in betrayed little to give it any sense of direction, but Luna seemed to know where she was going.

   “Where’s Tetra?” she asked. 

   “Just about everywhere by now,” Luna replied.

   *“My original body went down with the frigate,”* Tetra said, her voice crackling through Luna’s Tac-Band. *“Kinda sucks that I lost it, but it was worth it! Don’t worry. I’m fine.”*

Freya’s brow furrowed.

   “You duplicated yourself, didn’t you?” she asked.

   *“Oh yeah. I duplicated myself a LOT!”*

   “How much did I miss…?”

   “Yeah, we’ve had a busy few hours,” Luna said. “This big fucking Vasilios space station showed up and nuked the Sorrow from orbit with a railgun. Victor and Noah are at the bottom of the sea fixing their ship. Mason, Cedar and Cassandra are with their mother up near the top of the ship. Tetra is a virus now, and apparently Vi is a Void Dragon who is also currently captive on the ship.”

   *“Not anymore…”* Tetra chirped. Both Luna and Freya stared down at the Tac Band.

   “Please tell me you didn’t…” Freya said.

   *“I understand that you may have concerns about my actions, but in my defense, my actions were hilarious,""* Tetra replied. 

Freya rubbed her temples.

   “Okay well we can deal with that mess later…” Luna said, ducking into one of the guards' rooms. Two men lay gagged and zip tied in the corner. Freya stared at them as they walked in.

   “I had to take care of them before I got you,” Luna said, before opening up a locker. Freya could see her blades and coat inside and was quick to grab them, along with her own Tac Band. She watched as Luna opened up a second locker and took out a pair of collapsible batons along with a shotgun. She handed Freya a pistol that she clipped to her belt, before taking one for herself.

   “So, what’s the plan?” Freya asked.

   “I haven’t thought that far ahead, yet,” Luna admitted. “Right now I’m sorta just making it up as I go along.”

   ***“Fortunately for you both, I’m not.”*** Tetra said over the intercom. ***“Right now I’m trying to get into as many of the ship's subsystems as I can. It’s a process, but I’m making progress. I’ve currently got access to cameras and comms all over the ship though, and I can tell you that they’re not going to be sticking around here for much longer. The Chairwoman is getting the ship ready to depart. They’re going after the final God. I don’t have access to the bridge or the ship's controls, but I’m currently trying to get in.”***

   “Of course they are…” Freya murmured. “Tetra, can Victor make it on board?”

   ***“Repairs aren’t complete yet, but yes he should be able to get airborne now.”*** Tetra replied. ***“He’s going to have a hell of a time getting into the hangar though. I can spoof his ship's credentials for the approach but as soon as he lands, there’s a good chance they’ll recognize him.”***  
	Freya grimaced.

   “Do we have any other options?” Luna asked.

   ***“I’d suggest praying, but you morons killed most of the Gods. That said, he’s probably still going to try to make an approach anyway once he finds out he can.”***

   “Keep us posted,” Freya said. “What else do we need to be worried about?”

   ***“I’ve found some logs suggesting that there’s a device at the top of the ship, in the Vasilios Estate. Something that can open a door into the Void… a big one. I can’t see much of what’s going on up there. Something's blocking me. Not sure what. But I know something up there is drawing a lot of power and it’s not just the ship's reactor. If I had to hazard a guess, I’d imagine that once the God is dead, the Chairwoman is going to use that thing to finish the job.”***

Luna traded a look with Freya.

   “Sounds like we’ve got two targets, then. The generator and the bridge.” Freya said.

   “I’ll take the generator,” Luna said. “Mason’s up there, right? I’ve got to go and get him… plus I wouldn’t mind a little bit of face to face time with Estrella Vasilios.”

   “If she sees us coming and opens that doorway, you won’t be equipped for whatever comes through,” Freya warned. “I should go.”

   ***“You can both go. I should be able to handle the bridge,”*** Tetra said.

   “What if they lock you out?” Luna asked. 

   “***I’ve got options. But I can’t offer you much help up on the upper portion of the ship. It’s more or less completely detached and like I said, I’m having trouble getting into that system. You’ll be better off going together. If you can make it to elevator A1, I can at least send you up there.”***

The two women nodded.

   “Okay then… so, regicide it is,” Luna said. She turned to leave, and Freya followed her. The two left the detention block behind without another word.



\*\*\*



Victor watched the diagnostics of his ship as the legion of Tetra’s continued their work. 

   “How’s it looking?” Noah asked.

   “Like we should be good to launch,” Victor replied. “Tetra, can you confirm?”

   *“As long as you don’t get into another dogfight, then yes,”* Tetra said over the comms. *“The Platinum Future is making preparations to leave soon, so if you’re going to move, now’s the time.”*

Noah frowned.

   “Won’t they see us coming?” he asked.

   “Leave that to me,” Victor replied. “Tetra, fire up the engines.”

   *“Aye aye, captain.”*

There was a low, basslike rumble as the engines came to life. Victor sat behind the controls, priming the ship for takeoff. Noah took the seat beside him.

   “Look, I’ve got faith in you, Doc… but *‘leave it to me’* is a pretty vague outline for a plan,” he said. 

The ship began to move, rising up toward the surface of the sea. As it did, the countless Tetra drones made their way toward the shuttle bay, cramming themselves inside the closed air lock to fill the space that the shuttle had left behind.

   “We just need to say it’s salvage,” Victor said plainly.

   “Salvage…?” Noah asked. “You really think they’re gonna buy that?”

   ***“I was gonna spoof the ship's credentials. That might sell it more,”*** Tetra offered. Noah frowned, still not fully convinced.

The Dom Pérignon broke the surface, rising from the sea into the sky beneath the moonlight. Water cascaded down the sides of the ship as it ascended into the sky. Above them, Victor set his sights on the Platinum Future and took off toward it.

As they made their approach, a voice came in over the comms. 

    *“Echo-417, come in Echo-417. This is Hangar Control. Do you read us?”*

   *“This is Echo-417. We read you loud and clear.”* Tetra replied in a voice that sounded nothing like her own.

   *“Echo-417, we don’t see you on our flight schedule? Can you confirm the reason for your approach?”*

   *“Roger Control. The ship is salvage. Recovered from the operation earlier today. Désignation Dom Pérignon. Crew deceased. Admiral Skye authorized its retrieval.”*  Tetra said. *“Authorization 1-9324HE4.”*

There was a moment of silence as Hangar Control checked the code.

   *“Roger Echo-417. Please be advised that all ships landing will be subjected to quarantine. Please disable any on board drones.”*

   *“All drones disabled, Control. We’ll happily submit to quarantine.”*

Noah gave Victor a wary look. He noticed a ghost of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

   *“Excellent. You’re cleared for landing.”*            

The ship drew closer to the Platinum Future before approaching one of the hangars. Noah could already see technicians and security waiting for them.

   “We got a plan for that?” He asked nervously as they came in for a landing.

   “They just need to quarantine the drones,” Victor said dismissively. “Tetra, can you open the shuttle airlock and let them out?”

   *“With pleasure,”* the drone replied.

The shuttle air lock opened… and from it spilled a legion of drones. More than the technicians and the soldiers below were ready for. The drones descended on them, and though they lacked the weaponry Tetra’s original body had, they were still fast moving and solid. Their metal bodies slammed into the assembled figures, knocking several to the ground and scattering the rest as the *Dom Pérignon* landed gracefully in the hangar, completely undisturbed. 

   “See? Easy!” Victor said as he left the controls. He descended down to the shuttle bay, and headed straight for Noah’s makeshift armory, with Noah quietly following him. Victor wasted no time in grabbing a pistol and a holster, before looking expectantly at Noah. The other man just grabbed his rifle and exhaled nervously.

   “Fuck, this is a bad idea…” he murmured.

   “Oh, almost certainly,” Victor assured him. “But according to Tetra, my daughter is on this ship and I am getting her back.”

He didn’t bother going back up to use the ship's ramp. He opened the shuttle's airlock and stepped out through there. It was only a short drop to the ground.

An army of drones hovered around him, along with several newly (probably) unconscious bodies. Victor paid them little mind as he walked through the throng of Tetra’s.

   “Now… take me to Violetta.”



\*\*\*



Admiral Skye sat on the bridge, overseeing the preparations to move the ship. He took a sip of his coffee, as he watched the crew do their work. His body ached. He felt a bone deep exhaustion… but it was almost over.

Technically, the Platinum Future had its own commanding officer, but given what they were on the precipice of, Skye had relieved them. Soon they would be departing for Altumare, the domain of the last of the Gods. Soon they would kill it, and purge them from the Galaxy for good. A higher ranking officer deserved the privilege of overseeing this glorious moment personally. He deserved that privilege.

From the corner of his eye, he saw a new figure appear on the bridge, Lieutenant Theo Sawyer. He paused for a moment, sizing him up as Sawyer approached him.

   “Mr. Sawyer. Excellent timing. We could use you on the-”

   “A word first, Admiral?” Sawyer asked. There was an unfamiliar coldness in his voice. Skye raised an eyebrow before sighing and rising from his seat. He gestured for Sawyer to lead the way. The two stepped out, through the automatic door and into the hall.

   “What’s on your mind Lieutenant?” Skye asked.

   “No. No, you don’t get to play dumb with me here!” Sawyer growled. “I’ve been loyal to you, Admiral. I’ve done everything you’ve asked, I’ve been your errand boy, I’ve taken care of your ship. I thought we were friends, Admiral.”

	Skye’s brow furrowed.

   “You left me to die,” Sawyer said. “Back on the frigate. With that drone… you left me to die. You left everyone to die! The engine was overheating, and I was there trying to stop it. I was the one who issued the evac order. Where were you?”

His eyes burned into the Admiral. Accusing. Furious.

   “I took out the drone,” Skye said. “I lured it away from you and I destroyed it.”

   “Lured it away?” Sawyer repeated. “Did you now? Did you actually know it was going to leave me to follow you, or were you hoping that by the time it had killed me, you’d get a head start?”

   “I made a judgment call!” he argued. 

   “Bullshit. You ran for your ship. The drone followed you and you got lucky enough to kill it. Then, instead of staying behind to help try and save your ship, save your crew, you flew off.”

   “I trusted you to handle it…” Skye said, although there was a crack in his voice.

   “Trusted me?” Sawyer asked. “Did you even know that I was still alive before you saw me in the hangar?”

Skye didn’t answer that.

   “Then when you saw me, you didn’t even have the common decency to say something. No explanation. No excuses. Nothing until I walked onto the bridge, and the first thing you tried to do was order me around.”

   “I am your superior officer,” Skye snapped. 

   “No. Not anymore. I’m done. I’ve already put in a request for a transfer and I am here to provide my official resignation as your aide-de-camp, effective immediately,” Sawyer said.

The Admiral froze. Those words hit him like a punch to the jaw. He blinked in disbelief.

   “A transfer?” he asked. “You’re joking. Do you understand who I am, Lieutenant? I am an Admiral of the Vasilios naval fleet. I am one of the highest ranked men in our naval forces. You do not request a transfer away from me. Do you have any idea how many men just like you would kill to work under me? How many would do anything to spend just one day as my aide-de-camp?”

Sawyer stared at him, unimpressed. Skye’s breathing was getting heavier.

   *“Do you know who I am?”* He demanded again.

   “You’re a coward,” Sawyer replied. Skye just glared at him, his breathing slowly getting heavier as the rage boiled over.

   “I really wanted to respect you…” Sawyer continued. “I tried. I figured there had to be something to you. How else would you have made it so far? But you’re nothing but a stuffed shirt. The kind of man who runs away from his ship, his own crew at the first sign of trouble. So I’m do-”

Skye lunged for him, grabbing Sawyer and pinning him to the wall. Before the lieutenant could react, he felt Skye’s pistol pressed under his jaw.

   “If I pulled this trigger, nobody would question it,” Skye said. “I could tell them anything I wanted. Tell them you pulled a gun on me first. Tell them you turned traitor. Anything. Do you understand me?”

Sawyer just glared at him, a fury in his eyes that matched Skye’s.

   “Do you understand what it takes to climb the ranks in this Galaxy?” Skye asked, his voice lower now. “It’s not about skill. Being the best at anything gets you kept on the front lines. It’s about playing the game. Knowing how to work your way up… and one of the best ways to do that, is to avoid provoking your superior officers.”

Sawyer just continued to glare at him.

   “Do so again and I will kill you myself, you miserable sack of shit.” Skye said before finally letting him go. He smoothed down his uniform before letting out a calm exhale.

   “Good chat,” he said. “I’ll review your transfer request and ensure you wind up somewhere… appropriate. Until then your resignation is not accepted. Until further notice, you still work for me. Is that clear?”

Sawyer didn’t respond. His eyes remained locked with Skye’s.

   “I said… am I clear?” Skye repeated. His gun was still in his hand.

   “Crystal…” Sawyer panted.

   “Perfect. Now, get on the bridge. We have work to do.”

He ushered Sawyer back through the doorway to the bridge, just in time to witness everything go to shit. The moment he walked through the door, he was swarmed by two other officers.

   “Admiral, we have a breach on the lower level! Campbell’s lab. The Void Dragon is free!”

Skye froze.

   “What?! Where’s Campbell now?!”

   “Meeting with the Chairwoman, sir.”

Skye was about to demand they call him in, although before he could get the words out, the second officer cut him off.

   “Sir, we have another situation in Hangar 6. A ship carrying several of the infected drones has landed. They’ve been dispersed all across the ship!”

   *“What?!”*

The color drained from Skye’s face. It was happening again. Beside him, he noticed that Sawyer had gone stiff too.

   “Which ship?!” was all Skye could ask.

   “The ship's designation was the *Dom Pérignon,* sir…”

Victor.

Skye let out an enraged growl. He ran a hand across his scalp. 

   “Bring the whole ship up to red alert,” he demanded. “I want all non-security personnel in lockdown. Disconnect the bridge from the server to keep that fucking drone from seizing control of the ship, and utilize Voidmetal weapons for the Dragon. I want it dead!”

The officers moved, and Skye looked over to see Sawyer lingering behind him. The lieutenant didn’t say a word, but he didn’t need to. That glare spoke volumes.

   *‘Go on. Run away from this.’*  
  
\*\*\*



Victor and Noah raced through the halls of the Platinum Future, one of the Tetra drones floating at their side. 

   *“She was on the lower level,”* the drone said. *“I’ve disabled all security measures, so she’s out but I’m not sure where she’ll go next.”*

   “We’ll start with the atrium,” Victor said. “We can take the elevator down to sublevel 12, that’s where Campbell’s lab is located. We’ll get Vi, then regroup with the others!”

The atrium was just ahead. The three of them raced out into the open, only to find it almost completely abandoned. They slowed to a stop. 

   **“Attention. Station lockdown engaged. Please remain indoors.”** A voice - not Tetra’s - boomed over the intercom, filling the entire atrium.

   “Well, I guess they know we’re here…” Noah murmured. “Although with a lockdown, the elevators would be disabled for all nonessential personnel, right?”

   “Normally, yes,” Victor replied, taking off toward one of the elevators. “But that is why we have Tetra.”

   *“It’s true. I can unlock the elevators,”* the drone said, floating alongside Victor… although there wasn’t much need to do so.

The ground beneath them quaked. Victor took a step back as something tore through the floor a few feet away from him. He stared with wide eyes as he saw a familiar bone white crest rip through the ground, displacing the soil and stone planted there to feign something organic. 

The great serpent lifted its skeletal wings through the hole as it pulled itself through, letting out a deafening roar as it escaped the lower levels.

Victor stared up at the terrifying creature… the great Void Dragon, and his lips curled into a full grin.

   *“Violetta!”*

The Voidwalker's body twisted, its eyeless face turning to fixate on Victor. It stared down at him, seeing him. Its wings flared out as it pulled the rest of its body free of the hole.

Victor approached it, arms outstretched. Noah stayed a few feet behind him, watching the dragon warily. 

   “Sweetness… sweetness…” Victor crooned. “It’s okay… it’s okay now. Papa is here. I am here for you, darling. I am here…”

Vi’s head lowered, sinking down toward Victor. He reached out to put a hand on her crest.

   “My brave girl…” he said softly. “My strong girl… look at you. I came all this way to rescue you, and you’ve already rescued yourself.”

Tetra didn’t correct him.

Vi remained still for a moment, leaning into Victor’s touch. The dragon let out a low exhale, before her form seemed to collapse in on itself. Noah watched in awe as the massive creature folded back into a more recognizable shape… a familiar woman with wild ginger hair, who threw her arms around her father in a tight hug.

   “Papa…” Vi said. “I… I was afraid you were…”

   “Shot down, my darling but not in flames,” Victor assured her. “Oh, I’m so glad you’re safe…”

Noah took the opportunity to check in with Tetra.

   “Alright… so that’s one missing colleague down, where are the rest?”

   *“Freya and Vi already left to go to the top of the ship, where the Vasilios estate is… along with the wormhole generator, As far as I can tell, Mason, Cedar and Cassandra are also up there, although my visibility is more limited. I can’t get into that section of the ship's system remotely.”*

   “So I guess we’re going up,” Noah murmured, eyes following the elevator up toward the blindingly bright ceiling. 

The sound of gunshots made him move. Noah dove for safety, spotting an advancing group of soldiers out of the corner of his eye. 

The moment she noticed them, Vi threw herself in front of Victor, her body shifting. The handful of soldiers who had been sent after them froze up, watching as what had appeared to just be a young woman unraveled into a draconic nightmare that towered over the rest of them. They did not have time to put up a fight before she bore down upon them, scooping up several men in her jaws. A few of the braver men opened fire on her. Their bullets tore into her flesh, and Vi let out a roar of pain.

Victor reacted immediately, drawing his pistol and opening fire on some of the men who were bold enough to shoot. He managed to kill one, while the others seemed to freeze up, allowing Vi to sweep them away with one swing of her tail.

Victor looked up at her. He could see wounds in her flesh. Voidmetal weapons.  

   “Oh my dear… you’re hurt…” he said. Vi just huffed in response, but did not change back.

   “We should leave,” Noah said. “They’re just going to send more!”

   *“Actually… I could use your help down here…”* Tetra said, a little sheepishly. *“We may have been a little too loud with our entrance.”*

   “What’s wrong?” Noah asked.

   *“I’ve been trying to get access to the ship's controls for the past little while. The security there is a lot more advanced than it is on the rest of the ship. I assumed I’d be able to get through before your ship arrived. I was wrong, and now they’ve disconnected those systems from the rest of the ship. I can’t get in, which means I can’t stop the ship from leaving unless someone manually uploads me.”*

   “I see…” Victor said. “Noah and I can handle that, then. Vi, can you head up toward the top of the ship? If the wormhole generator is up there, then you’ll be of more use to Freya and Luna than to us.”

The Dragon huffed, before spreading her wings and beginning her ascent. Victor watched her go, before looking over toward Noah.

   “Come on, time to try again.”

Noah nodded and let Victor lead the way toward the bridge.",1,1765728099.0,HeadOfSpectre,0,1.0,False
1pmhhff,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1pmhhff/fast_startup/,Fast Startup,"I just got my Profitec Go after previously using an old Ascaso Dream.  So far I've made a Latte and an Americano, and both were delicious.  I just used the grind setting I'd been using with my Ascaso and was lucky enough to 28 gm out for 14 gm in in 30 seconds, so I'm pretty happy.

However I'm a little puzzled by the single sheet startup instructions that came with the machine.  I gather the ""Fast Startup"" is a new feature, and apparently it hasn't made it into the manual yet.  When the machine starts up, instead of displaying temperature it displays an ""UP"" message.  After about 6 minutes the message changes to ""FLU"", and you are suppose to flush for about 10 seconds with the empty portafilter mounted.  After you have flushed sufficiently a ""rdY/Go"" message is suppose to display to indicate the machine is ready to make coffee.

Reading between the lines I think that the fast startup is expected to overshoot the set temperature, so you need to flush to bring the temperature down.  When I've tried to follow the instructions the ""rdy/Go"" message never appears, and when I stop flushing the temperature has dropped to around 70 and then creeps back up to 93.

It appears to me that the ""Fast Startup"" software isn't working correctly on my machine.  Has anyone else seen this, or do you see the rdy/Go message and the temperature is ready for brewing?

Also, after flushing with the portafilter attached, when you take it off to fill it with coffee, it's full of water, which I then spill all over.",1,1765728087.0,ProfitecGo,0,1.0,False

Never drink strong black coffee. Always avoid it or drink very weak coffee. Otherwise the most important part of the SIBO test is the preparation. 



The day before the test - the preparation is the most important! Absolutely White Diet only. Rice, meats, potato and canola oil/butter. Tea preferred over coffee. Just skip dinner if you are annoyed. The goal of the SIBO test is to find out about SIBO not LIBO. If you eat FODMAP the day before the test, you will find out about your LIBO (Large Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth).

1pmhft8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmhft8/tongue_twisters_arent_just_games_for_kids_theyre/,Tongue twisters aren't just games for kids (they're precision workouts that fix your pronunciation faster than anything else),"I work with non-native professionals every day, and when they ask ""How do I improve my pronunciation quickly?"", most expect me to recommend apps or courses.

Here's what actually works fastest: tongue twisters.

**The problem with typical pronunciation practice:**

Most people think tongue twisters are just silly childhood games. They couldn't be more wrong.

For non-native English professionals who want to speak with more authority and clarity, these phrases are an absolute game-changer. They isolate and strengthen the exact muscles you need for crisp articulation, turning what might feel like clumsy pronunciation into a controlled, confident delivery.

I see this constantly: accomplished professionals who've been practicing pronunciation for months with minimal progress, when 5-10 minutes daily of targeted tongue twisters would have delivered faster results.

**What tongue twisters actually do (beyond the childhood game):**

This isn't just a hunch—it's backed by professional practice. A study of professional singers revealed that 63% rely on tongue twisters in their pre-performance routines. Even more telling, 72% were convinced the exercises sharpened their articulation and cut down on vocal strain.

Practicing tongue twisters consistently does more than just loosen up your lips and tongue. It actually forges stronger, faster connections between your brain and your articulators—the tongue, lips, and jaw.

This enhanced mind-muscle connection is what gives you the ability to speak clearly under pressure, whether you're navigating a tough client negotiation or presenting to the executive board.

The muscle memory you build acts as a safeguard against stumbling over words or leaning on filler words like ""um"" and ""ah.""

**The goal isn't speed—it's precision:**

Here's what nobody tells you upfront: the point of tongue twisters isn't to say them fast. It's to say them perfectly.

Precision is the foundation for speed. When you combine the two, you get powerful, intelligible speech that makes people stop and listen.

A fast, mumbled tongue twister is completely useless. A perfectly articulated one, even at a moderate pace, shows true vocal control.

**Your 5-minute daily warm-up (the highest ROI activity for your voice):**

The best part? Weaving this into your daily routine is incredibly simple. You don't need hours—just five dedicated minutes can set you up for a full day of more effective communication.

Here's the exact routine I give my clients:

**Phase 1: Breathing (1 minute)**

* Take 3-5 deep belly breaths
* Focus on slow, controlled exhales
* Goal: Center yourself and ensure proper breath support

**Phase 2: Lip & jaw loosening (1 minute)**

* Do lip trills (motorboat sound)
* Gentle jaw stretches (opening and closing)
* Goal: Relax key muscles around your mouth to prevent tension

**Phase 3: Articulation drills (1 minute)**

* Repeat ""pah-tah-kah"" or ""la-la-la"" clearly and quickly
* Goal: Activate the tongue and lips for precise movements

**Phase 4: Tongue twister practice (2 minutes)**

* Slowly and clearly recite 1-2 targeted tongue twisters
* Focus on perfect sounds, not speed
* Goal: Build muscle memory for challenging English sounds

This five-minute investment is one of the highest-return activities you can do for your professional presence.

**The proper warm-up sequence (don't skip this):**

Jumping straight into complex tongue twisters without any prep is a recipe for vocal strain. It's like trying to run a sprint the second you roll out of bed—your muscles aren't ready.

**Step 1: Start with breath**

The whole process starts not with your mouth, but with your breath. Think of proper diaphragmatic breathing as the engine that powers a strong, steady voice.

When you breathe deep into your belly instead of taking shallow sips of air from your chest, you create a stable column of air to support every sound you make.

**Step 2: Gently awaken your articulators**

Once you've centered your breath, it's time to wake up the physical parts of your mouth responsible for speech.

**Humming:** Place a hand on your chest and let out a simple ""mmmm"" sound. You should feel a slight vibration.

**Lip trills:** Blow air through relaxed, closed lips to make a motorboat sound. This releases tension in your lips and practices steady breath control.

**Jaw stretches:** With your fingertips, gently massage the hinge of your jaw (right near your ears). Then, let your jaw hang open loosely for a few seconds.

The goal here is relaxation, not exertion. A tense jaw, tight lips, or constricted throat are the biggest enemies of clear articulation.

**Step 3: Prepare the tongue**

Finally, focus on the star of the show: the tongue.

**Tongue point and curls:** Stick your tongue straight out. Point it up toward your nose, then down toward your chin.

**Tongue circles:** Slowly trace the outside of your lips with the tip of your tongue. Go clockwise, then counter-clockwise.

These actions improve your tongue's range of motion and your awareness of where it is in your mouth—making it much easier to execute the precise movements required for difficult English sounds.

**Targeting your specific problem sounds:**

Here's where tongue twisters become surgical tools instead of random practice.

Instead of just reciting random phrases, you can strategically pick twisters that directly tackle your personal pronunciation hurdles.

From my experience, most professionals find that a handful of English sounds consistently trip them up: the ""th"" sounds, the fluid ""r"" and ""l"" sounds, and complex vowel combinations.

**Mastering the tricky ""TH"" sound:**

The ""th"" sound requires placing the tip of your tongue either between or just behind your front teeth—a movement that can feel completely alien if your native language doesn't have it.

**Beginner:** ""The thirty-three thieves"" (focus on light tongue placement for each ""th"")

**Intermediate:** ""I thought a thought, but the thought I thought wasn't the thought I thought I thought"" (forces you to switch between ""t"" and ""th"" sounds)

**Advanced:** ""Through three cheese trees, three free fleas flew"" (combines ""th"" with ""r"" and ""f"")

My best advice: focus on the physical sensation. Can you actually feel the air flowing over your tongue as you make the ""th"" sound? This physical awareness is the key to consistency.

**Conquering the ""R"" and ""L"" distinction:**

For the ""l,"" your tongue tip needs to touch the roof of your mouth right behind your teeth. For the American ""r,"" you pull the body of your tongue back without the tip touching anything.

**For the ""L"" sound:** ""Lovely lemon liniment"" (feel your tongue tip tapping that ridge behind your teeth)

**For the ""R"" sound:** ""Around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran"" (keep your tongue pulled back and tense)

**For combining both:** ""Red leather, yellow leather"" (forces your tongue to move fast between ""l"" and ""r"" positions)

**Building your targeted practice set:**

Your practice routine should be personal. I've found that the most effective approach is to identify your top 2-3 problem sounds and build a small, dedicated set of twisters just for them.

You don't need to master dozens; focused repetition on a few key phrases will give you much better results.

**Quick reference for common problem sounds:**

|Target Sound|Beginner|Intermediate|Focus Area|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|""S"" vs ""SH""|She sells seashells|Surely the sun shall shine soon|Tongue shape and airflow|
|""P"" and ""B""|Peter Piper picked a peck|Betty Botter bought some butter|Lip control and voiced vs. unvoiced|
|Short vowels|A black cat sat on a mat|Ed said get ten red pens|Jaw opening and tongue height|

**The ""slow, clear, fast"" practice method:**

Having the right tongue twisters is great, but real improvement comes from how you practice them.

The most effective technique is what I call the ""Slow, Clear, Fast"" method—a three-stage process that prioritizes accuracy over speed.

**Stage 1: Slow** Take one tongue twister and say it out loud with deliberate, almost comical exaggeration. For ""Red leather, yellow leather,"" over-pronounce every single sound. Really feel how your tongue moves from the ""r"" to the ""l.""

**Stage 2: Clear** Say the phrase a bit faster but still very controlled. Your goal is perfect clarity without the over-the-top exaggeration. Every sound should be distinct and crisp.

Honestly, this is often the hardest part, but it's where the real magic happens.

**Stage 3: Fast** Only after you can nail the ""Clear"" stage multiple times should you attempt speed. Start to gradually pick up the pace, but the second you feel your articulation slipping, slow right back down.

**The goal is clarity at speed, not just speed itself.**

**Building reliable muscle memory:**

How do you make these new speech patterns stick? Aim for three to five perfect, consecutive repetitions of a tongue twister.

Hitting this target ensures you're not just getting it right by luck—you're actively building a reliable motor skill.

**Pro tip:** Use a metronome app. Start at a slow tempo, maybe 60 BPM, and only increase the speed once you can flawlessly hit your repetitions. This turns a subjective exercise into something you can actually measure.

**Weaving practice into your daily routine (the consistency secret):**

The most powerful tongue twister warm-ups are the ones you actually do, day in and day out.

This isn't about adding another chore to your list; it's about turning a simple practice into a career-boosting ritual.

**Weekly recording check-in:**

The most valuable tool is already in your pocket: your smartphone.

Pick a ""benchmark"" tongue twister. Once a week, record yourself saying it.

When you listen back, you get objective feedback you can't get from your own perception in the moment. You'll actually hear tangible improvements in clarity, speed, and vocal confidence.

**Simple progress checklist:**

As you listen back to your weekly recording, ask yourself:

* **Sound clarity:** Were my target sounds (like ""th"" or ""r"") crisp and distinct?
* **Pacing:** Did I keep a controlled and steady rhythm, or did I rush?
* **Flow:** Did words connect smoothly, or did I stumble in the same spots?
* **Confidence:** Does my voice project more strength and assurance compared to last week?

This focused listening turns a passive activity into active analysis.

**Key insight:** You cannot improve what you do not measure. Recording yourself provides the essential data you need to guide your practice and celebrate your progress.

**Find your 10-minute window:**

The real key to long-term success is seamlessly integrating a 10-minute warm-up into your existing schedule.

**Trigger moments to build the habit:**

* **During your morning commute:** Your car is a private sound booth
* **While making coffee:** Practice while the kettle boils (perfect two-minute window)
* **Right before an important call:** Quick lip trill and targeted twister to prime your voice

By linking your vocal warm-ups to an activity you already do every day, you remove the friction of trying to ""find"" extra time. It becomes automatic.

**Advanced techniques (when basic practice feels comfortable):**

Once you're comfortable with basic tongue twisters, try reverse enunciation.

Say a familiar tongue twister backward, one word at a time. ""She sells seashells by the seashore"" becomes ""Seashore the by seashells sells she.""

This drill is brilliant because it completely shatters your muscle memory and habitual speech patterns. It forces your brain and articulators to focus intensely on forming each individual word, building incredible vocal control and precision.

**Common practice pitfalls (and how to avoid them):**

**Mistake 1: Prioritizing speed over precision**

Racing through a tongue twister is totally useless if the sounds are sloppy and mumbled. The real goal is perfect, crisp articulation, even if you have to go painfully slow at first.

Speed will come naturally once your muscle memory is flawless.

**Mistake 2: Holding tension in your jaw**

A tight jaw physically restricts movement and muffles your sound. If you feel any strain or ache, stop immediately. Go back to gentle jaw stretches or massages.

**Key principle:** Clear speech is born from relaxation, not force. If you're clenching your jaw or straining your neck, you're actively working against your own progress.

**Mistake 3: Other habits that hold you back:**

**Forgetting to breathe:** Always support your speech with deep, diaphragmatic breaths. Proper breath support is the engine that powers a strong, clear voice.

**Practicing inconsistently:** A focused five minutes every single day is far more effective than one long, grueling session per week.

**Using random twisters:** Be strategic. Choose twisters that specifically target the English sounds you struggle with most.

**The practical takeaway:**

Tongue twisters are precision workouts for your mouth that build muscle memory faster than any other pronunciation practice.

Daily 5-minute routine:

1. **Breathing (1 min):** Deep belly breaths
2. **Loosening (1 min):** Lip trills and jaw stretches
3. **Activation (1 min):** ""pah-tah-kah"" drills
4. **Practice (2 min):** 1-2 targeted tongue twisters

The ""Slow, Clear, Fast"" method:

* **Slow:** Exaggerate every sound
* **Clear:** Perfect clarity without exaggeration
* **Fast:** Only increase speed once clarity is automatic

Target your specific problem sounds:

* TH: ""The thirty-three thieves""
* r/L: ""Red leather, yellow leather""
* S/SH: ""She sells seashells""

**What to ignore:**

The idea that speed is the goal. It's not. Perfect articulation is the goal. Speed is just the natural byproduct of flawless muscle memory.

Also ignore the temptation to skip the warm-up and jump straight into complex twisters. That's a recipe for vocal strain and poor results.

**Common questions:**

""How long should I practice daily?"" → A focused 5-10 minutes every day beats a marathon 30-minute session once a week. Consistency beats intensity every time.

""Will this get rid of my accent?"" → Tongue twisters aren't for ""accent reduction""—they're for improving articulation and clarity within any accent. The goal is being easily understood, not sounding native.

""What if my jaw feels tight?"" → Stop immediately. Go back to gentle jaw stretches. Prioritize relaxation over speed or force. Pushing through tension makes it worse.

""Can I practice silently?"" → No. You must practice out loud. The whole point is to physically train the muscles of speech and connect their movements to your brain's commands.

**The uncomfortable reality:**

Most people waste months on pronunciation apps and courses when 5-10 minutes daily of targeted tongue twisters would deliver faster, more noticeable results.

The difference between someone who sounds clear and confident versus someone who sounds uncertain often comes down to this kind of systematic, physical practice.

This isn't about memorizing word lists or watching videos. It's about building new neural pathways between your brain and your articulators—the tongue, lips, and jaw.

That muscle memory you build acts as a safeguard when you're under pressure, when you're nervous, when you're thinking fast. It makes clear articulation automatic instead of something you have to consciously manage.",1,1765727987.0,intonetic,0,1.0,False

1pmheu7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmheu7,“A long time coming:” Winter Hill neighbors cheer start of Star Market demolition - Jeff Shwom,"The first pieces of roofing at a former Star Market came down Saturday, symbolizing the start of a multiyear housing and mixed-use building project on Winter Hill. 

A crowd gathered across the street at Winter Hill Brewing cheered the first pulls of a construction excavator’s claw to the facade of the long-closed grocery store at[ 299 Broadway](https://share.google/EVSdUiOFtaHGngxjk).

“This has been a long time coming,” said Winter Hill Brewing owner Bert Holdredge at the neighborhood demolition party he hosted at his taproom and coffee bar. “I never thought I’d see this day.” 

Noting the nearly 3 acres of “blight,” Holdredge said he supported the project “in an area that needs a little bit of rejuvenation” and a city that “desperately needs housing.”

Mark Development and its partners Beacon Communities and RISE Together plan for the 2.6-acre parcel to hold two mixed-use buildings with 288 apartments and retail, outdoor community gathering areas and an arts and creative civic enterprise space, according to[ the project website](http://www.299broadwaysomerville.com/). Around half of the homes will be affordable, meaning they will be offered only to households earning 80% or below of the area median income.

The whole building is expected to be demolished within a week and a formal ground-breaking ceremony and project kickoff held early next year, representatives of the developers said.

Mayor-elect Jake Wilson, who lives less than two-tenths of a mile from the site, spoke of 299 Broadway as a model project to help ease an affordable housing shortage in Somerville.

“We have a goal of getting 20% affordable in \[all of\] Somerville. Mathematically, we all know we will never get there if every project is that 20% minimum inclusionary zoning,” Wilson said. “That is why we need projects like this that can push us toward that goal.”

The Winter Hill Brewing party drew project neighbors, politicians and community supporters, and mixed the festive with the civic. Resident Katie Scull said her group of friends – including a dog adorned in a Christmas sweater – came for a “fun hangout and fun Somerville thing to do in the morning.” Among them, though, was Joey Gardner, who lives about two blocks from the project site and said he was “pretty excited for this project to commence.”

“It’s kind of sad to have so many blighted areas in the region, so it’s kind of cool to see housing” come in, Gardner said.

Gardner said he would be happy to see the developers deliver third spaces – social gathering spaces outside of the home. The project includes 15,000 square feet of plaza and park space for civic use, 3,000 square feet of community and “flexible meeting” space, and an arts and creative enterprise space.

Event co-host and city councilor Jesse Clingan said that when he first ran for office in 2017, “every single door I went to brought up ‘What’s going to happen with the old Star Market?’ For this to be finally happening for the city is huge for this community.”

Clingan was hopeful that community input during the public process would be included in the final project. “A lot of the things that were in the original neighborhood plan for Winter Hill have been incorporated,” he said, citing a public corridor between the two buildings that goes to a public park on Sewall Street.[ The Winter Hill Neighborhood Plan](https://voice.somervillema.gov/winter-hill-plan-implementation) was adopted in 2016 with priorities of rejuvenating Broadway as a commercial main street and “to reconnect Winter Hill to the rest of the city” physically and culturally.

Thus, as a cosplay royal taste tester, I took it as my civic duty to scout out the best cafes and restaurants in the Marrakech medina and deliver them to you, the good people. So here is my tried and tested guide to the best coffee spots, full Moroccan breakfasts, sneaky beers and authentic feasts in the medina.",1,1765727891.0,moroccosurfcoast,0,1.0,False
1pmhegg,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pmhegg/how_the_hell_does_one_navigate_workorganization/,How the hell does one navigate work/organization type of parties?!,"Parties in general are so difficult for me. I had two parties in the past few weeks with an organization I'm involved with. I'm not talking about a wild party at someone's house with booze and drugs everywhere, I'm talking about an adult social event type of thing. 



The first one: I got to the place which was like an arcade thing with all kinds of games and entertainment and bowling. I just stood against the wall and nobody talked to me. I had to leave after 15 minutes despite everyone else bowling, doing karaoke, playing pool, etc. I don't know how to penetrate the little groups of 3-4 people talking in a circle. What do I do, just walk up and insert myself? Feels so awkward and my heart was pounding. I went and sat in the car for an hour, came back in, spent another 15 minutes standing there talking to nobody, and anxiety won. I just left.

  
There was another event at a coffee shop. Again, I had to force myself to go in. I stood there and a few people talked to me, but going around introducing myself just seems impossible. This time I made it through the night because when I run away from situations I feel so much worse in the end, but I truly don't understand how people get into these little chat groups/circles. It feels like the hardest thing in the world.

  
Just ranting I guess.

**MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT** **DIPLOMATIC CABLE / SECURE TRANSMISSION**

**ID:** ND-204X-1014-ALPHA **DATE:** October 14, 204X **FROM:** Henri Devalier, Consul General of France, New Delhi **TO:** Crisis and Support Centre (CDCS), Paris / Asia-Oceania Directorate **SUBJECT:** URGENT - IDENTIFICATION AND RECOVERY OF FRENCH NATIONAL (KINNAUR DISTRICT) **CLASSIFICATION:** RESTRICTED // PRIORITY HIGH

**1. SUMMARY OF INTERVENTION**

Pursuant to the request of the Governor of Himachal Pradesh (dated Oct 1st), I proceeded personally to the village of Chitkul, Kinnaur District, to assess the situation of an unidentified Caucasian male living in semi-isolation.

Indian authorities declined to utilize standard law enforcement protocols, citing the ""sensitive local political status"" of the individual. I can now confirm the subject is a French National.

Biometric field scan matches the identity of **REID, Georges**. *Status:* Missing/Presumed Deceased. *Reference:* Passenger Manifest, Flight AF-884 (Paris-Singapore), Incident Date: Feb 12. Disappeared after the emergency landing in Delhi.

**2. OBSERVATIONS ON SITE**

The journey to Chitkul requires traversal of the Hindustan-Tibet road. Upon arrival, the situation presented immediate anomalies inconsistent with standard ""missing person/psychotic fugue"" cases.

The subject was not living as a beggar. He was residing in a cave system near the Mathi Temple. However, the local population (approx. 900 residents) has not marginalized him. Conversely, they have integrated him into their administrative hierarchy.

**Notable Observation:** The village of Chitkul demonstrates a level of logistical efficiency previously unrecorded in this region.

* Waste management has been centralized using a gravity-fed chute system.
* Winter fuel stockpiles are arranged in precise, mathematical grids to maximize drying airflow.
* Irrigation disputes between families have ceased entirely.

When questioned, the Village Headman stated that ""The Silent One"" (the subject) had ""drawn the lines"" for them. The subject appears to have reorganized the village’s socio-economic structure using verbal instructions and non-verbal diagrams drawn in the dirt.

**3. INTERACTION WITH SUBJECT**

I located the subject inside the cave dwelling. The interior was spartan but meticulously organized. The walls were covered in charcoal markings. Initial analysis suggests these are not religious iconography, but complex flowcharts depicting hydraulic pressure and resource allocation algorithms.

**Physical Condition:** The subject is emaciated but exhibits high muscular density. Hygiene is poor, yet orderly. No signs of drug use or fever.

**Psychological State:** When I initiated contact in English, there was no response. When I switched to French (*""Monsieur, je suis le Consul de France""*), the subject displayed a violent physiological reaction (pupil dilation, tremors).

He did not respond to emotional cues. He did not ask about family. His first verbal communication was to correct my statement regarding the time of day, pointing out that my analog watch was losing 4 seconds per day based on the solar position.

**4. THE ""TRIGGER"" EVENT**

I presented the biometric scanner. The subject allowed the scan without resistance. Upon the device emitting the confirmation ping, the subject looked at the screen.

He touched the French flag icon on the interface. He stated: *""The Republic is a grid. But the grid is misaligned.""*

This appears to be the breakthrough moment. He is lucid, but his affect is totally flat. He speaks of France not as a home, but as a ""system"" that he recalls studying.

**5. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION**

We are currently in transit back to New Delhi. The subject is compliant but unnerving. He spent the descent redesigning our convoy’s driving pattern to minimize fuel consumption, tapping on the glass to instruct the driver.

**Warning:** While physically stable, Georges Reid is not the man described in his pre-disappearance dossier. The ""Logistician"" profile is accurate but understated. He exhibits traits of high-functioning savant syndrome induced by trauma.

I recommend immediate psychiatric evaluation upon arrival at the Embassy. I also recommend we do not underestimate him. The Governor of Himachal Pradesh was not relieved to see him go; he looked like he was losing a valuable asset.

**End of Cable** **H. Devalier**

EMBASSY OF FRANCE – NEW DELHI

MEDICAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL UNIT

CONFIDENTIAL REPORT

Date: October 18, 204X

Attending Physician: Dr. Évelyne Frot (Visiting Psychiatrist, Paris Hospitals)

Patient: REID, Georges (DOB: 12/05/1977)

Subject: 72-Hour Observation & Competency Evaluation

1. INITIAL PRESENTATION (Day 1)

The patient was admitted following extraction from Kinnaur District. The physical state was dehydrated but robust. Mental state upon admission was characterized by ""hyper-vigilance."" Patient scanned the room constantly, seemingly counting objects or assessing dimensions. Affect was flat.

* **Medication:** Patient refused standard anxiolytics (Diazepam) and antipsychotics (Olanzapine). Stated simply: ""I require full signal fidelity.""
* **Compliance:** High. Patient agreed to all non-chemical interventions and interviews.

2. PATIENT STATEMENT (Recorded Day 2)

When asked to recount the events precipitating his disappearance, the patient provided the following narrative:

*""Why me? After the brutal announcement of the death of what remained of my family, burnt alive in a car accident, I decided to go around the world chasing... whatever. And the fucking plane decided to break down above India, so 24h with a free hotel voucher to discover the city. The last clear idea I remember was walking outside of the terminal getting punched in the gut by humidity, temperature and noise. My vision turned to black, I remember walking blind, hustled by cars, people, an alley and a brutal aggression; they took everything, including what was left of my sanity. Delayed PTSD after the family trauma? No idea Doctor, I am a logistician, not a shrink (wink).*

*After that, just feelings: intense pain, intense heat, intense thirst and hunger. Must have been on a local bus then ejected when they saw I had no money? The trip north must have been an odyssey, but I must have looked more and more like one of those indian wandering hermits, and temples everywhere always provide enough to survive.*

*How I ended up in Kinnaur, no idea, just flashing images, until the last night. I was caught high in the mountain in a terrifying thunderstorm, what was left of my body beaten like pulp. Without the cave it would have been the end of the road. Maybe, unconsciously, I wanted to join my family? Your job to figure that out Doctor (a smaller smile). At the bottom of the grotto was a deep pond. Did not see it, went down like a stone.* 

*But there something happened, a presence, a warmth, a friend at last. I know you told me it was my real me reemerging from the psychosis, and I trust you. I was warm, quiet, but my mind was buzzing with symbols, images… The following day was clear and crisp, and I no longer felt the cold. A woman came and after a moment of surprise she spoke to me. And I answered. In her language. She took me for a hermit and brought me some very simple food.*

*And the following day she started to tell me about her life and her big problem, involving a mix of family feud, marriage, money, an impossible cliff to climb for that poor woman. But I clearly saw the problem, as a graph. And I told her quietly, gently the solution. After that you know what happened, I became the resident Mc Kinsey of the place (laugh).""*

3. CLINICAL PROGRESSION (Days 2-3)

The recovery trajectory has been unprecedented. The catatonic/dissociative symptoms observed by Consul Devalier evaporated within 24 hours.

By the morning of Day 2, Mr. Reid was engaging in casual conversation. He inquired about the current French political election cycle, the football scores (Ligue 1), and requested a specific brand of coffee. The ""Hermit"" persona described in the police reports seems to have been a temporary adaptive mechanism to the extreme isolation.

* **Observation:** The patient is surprisingly charming. He apologized profusely to the nursing staff for the trouble caused by his ""camping trip gone wrong."" He displays a self-deprecating humor regarding his memory loss, framing it as a ""mid-life crisis that got out of hand.""

4. COGNITIVE TESTING & ANOMALIES

To assess potential neurological damage from high-altitude exposure, standard psychometric testing was administered.

* **Test A (Morning, Day 2) - Standard Raven’s Matrices:**
   * **Result:** **UNSCORABLE / CEILING.**
   * **Notes:** The patient completed the 45-minute battery in 8 minutes. Responses were 100% accurate. The speed of processing suggested a cognitive event bordering on mania or a testing error.
* **Test B (Afternoon, Day 2) - WAIS-V (Adult Intelligence Scale):**
   * **Result:** **118 (High Average).**
   * **Notes:** Suspecting the morning's result was a calibration error or a fluke of the testing software, a proctored exam was given. Mr. Reid performed within the standard deviation for his professional background (Logistics Manager). He struggled appropriately with complex spatial rotation tasks and verbal analogies.
* **Conclusion on Testing:** The morning result should be disregarded as a technical anomaly. The patient's IQ is stable at \~115-118. He is bright, but well within normal limits.

**5. DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSION**

* **Axis I:** Brief Psychotic Disorder (Resolved). Triggered by hypoxia and isolation.
* **Axis II:** No personality disorders detected.
* **Current Status:** Lucid, Oriented x3 (Time, Place, Person).

6. RECOMMENDATION

Mr. Reid exhibits no danger to himself or others. The ""delusions of grandeur"" reported in the mountains (drawing maps, ordering villagers) have ceased entirely. He appears eager to return to France and ""get back to work.""

I see no psychiatric grounds to hold him. I recommend discharge with a referral for outpatient therapy in Paris to process the trauma of his time in the wilderness.

Signed,

Dr. Évelyne Frot

MD, Psychiatry

**CONSULATE GENERAL OF FRANCE – NEW DELHI** **ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM**

**DATE:** October 20, 204X **TO:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Paris) / Department of Nationals Abroad **FROM:** Henri Devalier, Consul General **REF:** Case File #ND-204X-1014 (REID, Georges) **SUBJECT:** CASE CLOSURE AND DEPARTURE STATUS

**1. FINANCIAL SOLVENCY CHECK** Following standard repatriation protocols, we conducted a cursory review of Mr. Reid's domestic assets to determine liability for extraction costs.

* **Liquidity:** Confirmed.
* **Total Net Worth:** \~€1,150,000 (Estimate).
* **Source:** Combined proceeds from the sale of primary residence (Paris, 15th Arr.) and life insurance payouts regarding the familial accident mentioned in the medical report. Funds are currently held in a holding account with BNP Paribas.

**2. REPATRIATION STATUS: DECLINED** Mr. Reid has formally declined the offer of a repatriation flight to Charles de Gaulle Airport. During the exit interview, he appeared calm but firm. When pressed on his reasons for not returning to his support network in France, he stated:

*""France is full of unpleasant memories. It is a museum of who I used to be. I am not a museum curator.""*

**3. FORWARD MOVEMENT** Mr. Reid has reactivated his original travel itinerary. He has purchased a one-way business class ticket to **Singapore (Changi)**, departing tomorrow, October 21.

He indicated an intention to settle in the city-state ""for a while,"" citing its status as a logistics hub as ""soothing to his current state of mind.""

**4. CONCLUSION** All Consular fees for the Himachal Pradesh extraction have been paid in full by the subject via wire transfer. We have no further legal hold on Georges Reid. He is a free agent.

**Case #ND-204X-1014 is CLOSED.**

Zionists have immediately exploited the terror attack in Sydney to attack Palestine solidarity.

The same kind of pro-Israel commentators who do this, also have nothing to say about the weaponization of the Star Of David by IOF & settler terrorists.

[During the ongoing Gaza genocide, IOF terrorists et al have carved the Star of David into Gaza City:](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2023/11/WhatsApp_Image_2023-11-16_at_08.47.43-e1700328306866.jpeg)

There are numerous examples of IOF, settlers, and civilians in Israel or supporters in the diaspora, weaponizing these symbols.

* [JOC - Three mosques targeted by ‘Star of David’ vandalism in Austin, TX.

There's also weird historical examples in the US. Examples during previous wars. Examples of Palestinians being branded by IOF terrorists. etc.

* [JOC - The Star of David is not for Branding](https://old.reddit.com/r/JewsOfConscience/comments/1610pdj/the_star_of_david_is_not_for_branding/jxun4oa/)

This behavior of 'marking' Palestinians, their land, homes, buildings (anything from elementary schools to mosques), vehicles, etc. - is an act of supremacist domination, whether it's soldiers or settlers or civilians abroad or inside the green-line.

Yet now, those very hands were being trampled, crushed mercilessly under someone's foot.
The culprit was none other than her own husband, Caleb Archer, heir to Seattle's most powerful family.
Caleb sat calmly on a chair, impeccably dressed.
On the large screen behind him, a live feed showed Kimberly's younger sister, Emily Gordon, being dragged by several burly men into a dimly lit room. Her desperate, broken cries tore at Kimberly's heart.
""Kim, either get up and operate on Kate's mother, or tomorrow I'll spread this video all across Seattle.""
Kimberly clenched her jaw, her eyes bloodshot as she stared at Caleb.
""Caleb, why are you doing this to me?
""Katherine ran my mother over and killed her! You knew it! And now you're forcing me to operate on her mother? A brain tumor—she deserves it!""
One month ago, Kimberly's mother, out early buying groceries, was hit and killed by Katherine Shaw, who was driving under the influence after a night of heavy drinking.
Kimberly immediately filed a lawsuit against Katherine.
However, in less than three days, someone else voluntarily took the blame.
Seeing the real murderer walk free, Kimberly couldn't accept it. She took the case to court again, but was repeatedly rejected.
Even her professorship was revoked by the hospital, and she was suspended indefinitely.
Just as she was in despair, Katherine's mother, Sarah Shaw, fell ill.
Her tumor was in such a critical location that no one in the entire city except Kimberly would dare operate.
Kimberly refused. Performing surgery on the mother of the woman who killed her own mother was unbearable.
But the next moment, she was kidnapped and taken to a basement.
Then, she saw Caleb. She finally understood that her husband, who seemed to love her dearly, had always held another woman deep in his heart.
""Kim, time is running out.""
Caleb's voice pulled Kimberly back to reality.
""I'll give you three more minutes. If you still refuse to operate on Sarah, I'll have no choice but to go live—and let the entire city, even the whole country, watch your sister’s explicit video!""
Emily's heart-wrenching pleas for help caused Kimberly excruciating pain.
Kimberly clenched her fists tightly, a rush of sickening sweetness stinging her mouth. ""Caleb, have you forgotten the promise you made when you married me?""
On their wedding day, Caleb knelt on one knee before Kimberly and solemnly promised, ""Kim, from today onward, your family is my family. I will protect them forever.""
Caleb seemed not to hear Kimberly's hoarse words, his gaze cold.
""Kim, there's only one minute left. Your sister's fate is in your hands.""
The light in Kimberly's eyes dimmed instantly, leaving only utter despair. Clenching her teeth, she uttered the words that satisfied Caleb.
""I'll operate on Sarah.""
Caleb rubbed her hair with satisfaction.
""Good girl! After the surgery, I'll give you a villa as compensation.""
Kimberly found the smile on Caleb's face utterly ironic.
She was soon taken into the operating room. The tumor removal surgery lasted a full twelve hours.
Exhausted, Kimberly walked out of the operating room. Before she could even catch her breath, her phone rang.
It was a call from her friend.
""Kimberly, something terrible has happened! The live stream showing Emily being assaulted is everywhere—she couldn't handle it, and now she's trying to jump off a building!""
With a clatter, Kimberly's phone fell to the floor. She staggered out, her voice trembling.
""How could this happen? Caleb promised me he would let Ems go if I did the surgery!""
Soon, Kimberly arrived at the rooftop. The fire department was already there. Emily sat quietly on the edge of the rooftop, shattered and desperate.
Terrified, Kimberly looked at her. ""Emily, I'm here. Please don't do this. Everything will be fine. Believe me, okay?""
Emily slowly turned her head. When she saw Kimberly, a faint smile finally appeared on her face. ""Kim, you're here.""
Kimberly slowly moved forward.
""Ems, come down! I'm begging you! I can't lose you!""
There was nothing in Emily's eyes—no fear, no hope, no life.
""Kim, I'm sorry. But I really can't find the will to live anymore.""
After saying this, Emily slowly stood up, offering Kimberly a faint smile. ""Kim, I'm going to be with Mom now.""
As the words fell, she leaned backward without hesitation.
Kimberly charged forward like crazy, but she couldn't catch anything.
""No! Ems, no!""
All the firefighters rushed over, firmly restraining and pulling Kimberly back.
Kimberly struggled with all her might.
""Let me go! I have nothing left. I have no family anymore!""
A sharp, tearing pain ripped through Kimberly's chest; blood surged up her throat, and the world went dark.
When she woke, the smell of disinfectant filled her nose. She sat up, an empty shell.
Then she dialed the long-forgotten number from five years ago.
""I accept your terms. But I have one condition—I want Caleb and Katherine to pay the price they deserve!""
There was a brief pause on the other end, then a deep voice came through.
""Okay. I will come pick you up in one month.""
After hanging up, Kimberly sent a message to her lawyer.
""Draw up a divorce agreement for me immediately.""
Chapter 2
The message had just been sent when the hospital room door was shoved open forcefully.
Before Kimberly could clearly see who entered, she was pulled into a familiar embrace.
""Kim, I'm so sorry about what happened to your sister, but it was all an accident. The equipment went wrong.""
Caleb's gentle voice sounded in her ear, but it only made Kimberly feel utterly sick.
Expressionlessly, she pushed Caleb away. The love in her eyes had long since vanished, replaced only by endless hatred.
Sensing Kimberly's coldness, Caleb took her hand, his eyes filled with tenderness as if nothing had ever happened.
""Kim, didn't you want your position back? I've already notified the hospital. You'll even get the professorship title you've always wanted.""
Kimberly let out a cold laugh and shook off Caleb's hand.
""Is this your compensation to me? After I lost my mother and sister?""
Kimberly had never imagined any of that.
Back when Caleb was ambushed, a bullet lodged between his ribs, and no one in Seattle dared to perform the surgery.
It was she who stepped forward without hesitation, braving immense pressure to successfully save Caleb. It made him fall in love with her.
After that, Caleb began pursuing Kimberly madly. He gave her countless flowers and jewelry. He even transferred fifty percent of his shares to Kimberly before marriage, giving her a full sense of security.
Everyone said Kimberly was the luckiest woman in Seattle, and even she used to think so.
But Caleb's unforgettable love returned from abroad. Kimberly saw Katherine's face that bore a five or six out of ten resemblance to her own. Then, she understood everything.
She was just a pitiful substitute.
Just then, the lawyer suddenly walked in with a document, pulling Kimberly's thoughts back to the present.
The moment Caleb saw the lawyer, his face darkened instantly, and a flash of menace crossed his eyes as he looked at Kimberly.
""You still won't give up, will you? You still want to sue Kate?""
Kimberly took the divorce agreement from the lawyer, looking at Caleb with scorn.
""You said you'd compensate me with a villa, right? Sign this!""
Hearing it was about the compensation, Caleb instantly breathed a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to open the file to look, the door was pushed open again.
Katherine rushed in, her face panicked.
""Caleb, my mother suddenly said her chest hurts terribly! Did something go wrong with the surgery?""
Caleb's expression darkened. He reached out and gripped Kimberly's wrist tightly.
""Didn't you say Sarah's surgery was very successful? Why is this happening? What did you do?""
Looking at Caleb's anxious appearance, Kimberly found it incredibly ironic, remembering his cold indifference on the day her mother died.
""Postoperative complications are common.""
Katherine looked at Kimberly nervously.
""Ms. Gordon, I know you don't like me. Just direct all your resentment at me. I'm begging you. Don't take it out on my mother!""
Caleb looked at Kimberly with a sinister gaze. ""You will go treat Sarah right now. If anything else goes wrong, Kim, you know what I'm capable of!""
But Kimberly just stared coldly at the document in Caleb's hand.
""Sign it, and I'll go immediately!""
Caleb looked at her with a sulky expression.
""Kimberly, are you threatening me?""
""Caleb, this is what you owe me!"" Kimberly's voice was cold yet carried a hint of fragility.
Caleb was taken aback, but then he stepped forward and quickly signed his name.
""Are you happy now?""
Kimberly took the signed divorce agreement and immediately handed it to the lawyer standing by.
""Get it processed as soon as possible!""
The lawyer hurriedly placed the divorce agreement into his briefcase and nodded at Kimberly.
""Ms. Gordon, it will only take 30 days to complete the entire process.""
Watching Kimberly interact with the lawyer, Caleb felt an inexplicable sense of panic and a vague unease for no reason.
After seeing the lawyer out, Kimberly followed Katherine to the special care ward. The moment she entered, a vase came flying hard towards her forehead.
Chapter 3
The vase shattered on the floor, bright red blood dripping slowly from Kimberly's forehead.
Katherine's mother, Sarah Shaw, glared at her viciously.
""You bitch! Did you tamper with something during my surgery? Why does my chest hurt so much?""
Kimberly clenched her fists tightly, her gaze icy as she looked at the woman on the bed.
She had operated for a full twelve hours, at the cost of losing her sister, to save this woman. And now, the first thing she did upon waking was to accuse her!
""Pain is normal after surgery. Since you're still able to curse, you should be fine!""
As Kimberly turned to leave, Katherine blocked her path.
""Ms. Gordon, if you don't examine my mother, I'm afraid Caleb will hold you accountable.""
Kimberly didn't want further trouble before the divorce was finalized.
She swallowed her anger and walked back to the bedside. Just as she took out her stethoscope, Sarah suddenly raised her hand and slapped Kimberly across the face.
""Do you even know how to examine a patient? Are you just fooling me with that stethoscope?""
Kimberly covered her swollen, red cheek, staring furiously at the woman on the bed.
""Mrs. Shaw, if you have any doubts, you can request another doctor. But assaulting me repeatedly constitutes personal injury.""
As soon as she finished speaking, another sharp smack echoed.
Sarah had slapped her again.
""So what if I hit you? Are you going to sue me? Have you forgotten how your sister died? Maybe you'll be the next one being seen naked by everyone.""
Sarah looked at Kimberly triumphantly.
""Then again, your mother was a fraud who deserved to be run over! Your sister was a shameless whore! I guess you're no good either!""
Hearing her mother and sister being insulted by the person responsible for their deaths, Kimberly lunged forward like crazy, her hands closing around Sarah's neck.
""You killed them! How dare you insult them? I don't mind killing you after saving your life!""
Suddenly, a strong force shoved Kimberly away violently. She crashed into the bedside table, searing pain instantly radiating through her body.
Caleb stood before the hospital bed, shielding Katherine and Sarah behind him, looking at Kimberly with disgust.
""Kimberly, I thought you had changed after what happened to your sister. I never imagined you'd escalate to attacking a patient? You've utterly disappointed me!""
Katherine threw herself against Caleb's chest, sobbing pitifully.
""Caleb, I don't know why Ms. Gordon suddenly went crazy, but my mother just went through major surgery and needs to be taken good care of.""
Looking at the tearful woman in his embrace, Caleb felt sorry. He held her tightly in his arms and glared coldly at Kimberly.
""Kimberly, apologize!""
Kimberly clenched her fists, fighting to keep the tears from falling, staring defiantly at Caleb.
""Why should I apologize? Why should I apologize to the people who killed my family?""
Caleb's expression darkened. He gestured lightly to the bodyguards behind him.
""Since she refuses to apologize, take her to the punishment room. She can come out when she realizes her mistake.""
When she heard that, Kimberly's pupils contracted instantly.
The punishment room was the Archer family's forbidden zone, where Caleb kept two fierce dogs as guards.
The dogs were extremely ferocious and had injured multiple people over the years.
Kimberly looked at Caleb in terror.
""Caleb, you can't send me to the punishment room!""
But Caleb didn't even glance at her.
Kimberly was practically dragged to the punishment room.
As soon as she entered, the two dogs fixed their eerie eyes intently on her.
Kimberly turned to run, but the bodyguards shut the heavy doors without hesitation.
""Caleb, you can't do this to me! I can't stay here. I'll die!""
The wound on Kimberly's forehead was still untreated, the scent of blood lingering. The moment the dogs caught the smell, they lunged.
One dog clamped its jaws tightly around Kimberly's right hand, while the other pinned her down. Its over-90-kilogram weight crushed her, making it hard to breathe.
Gritting her teeth against the pain, she fumbled for her phone and called Caleb.
The phone rang for a long time before it was answered.
""Caleb, save me! The dogs have gone mad!""
Caleb, on the other end of the line, paused. Before he could speak, Katherine's voice came through the phone.
""Caleb, I remember how obedient those two dogs were when I gave them to you. There's no way they would hurt anyone.""
After that, Caleb's voice turned cold.
""Kim, don't try any tricks. I'll let you out when you admit your mistake.""
Hearing Caleb's resolute words, Kimberly felt helpless.
So, he thought even her plea for help was just a trick.
The next moment, a sickening crack sounded. An excruciating pain shot through her wrist, which was caught in the dog's jaws, nearly making her black out. She didn't even have the strength to scream anymore.
Crimson blood flowed incessantly. Kimberly's consciousness began to fade.
Before losing consciousness, she thought she saw Caleb charging in frantically. He held her tightly in his arms.
""Kim, I'm sorry!""
Chapter 4
When she woke again, Kimberly was back in the familiar hospital room.
A sharp, drilling pain shot through her hand, and she realized she couldn't lift it at all.
She sat up in a panic. Her right hand, apart from the pain, had completely lost all strength.
""How could this be?""
Large tears rolled down Kimberly's cheeks. Frantic and helpless, she tried to get out of bed. Hearing the commotion, Caleb immediately rushed over from the sofa and pulled her into his embrace tenderly.
""Kim, I'm so sorry. The dog severed the tendons in your hand. You can't be a doctor anymore.""
Kimberly looked down at her hand, her mouth opening, but no words coming out.
Her most proud possession, the hand that established her in the medical world, was now crippled.
How was she supposed to accept it?
In the following days, Caleb stayed by Kimberly's side, even personally assisting her with washing up.
Kimberly remained in the hospital for a full week before being discharged.
On the way home, Kimberly stared silently out the window. Caleb reached over and took her hand, his face full of tenderness.
""Kim, I've arranged a special memorial service for your mother and sister tomorrow. We'll see them off with the dignity they deserve.""
When she heard about the memorial service, Kimberly's expression softened slightly. Just as she was about to speak, Caleb's phone rang.
Kimberly glanced at the caller ID. It was Katherine.
""Caleb, my mother's chest hurts again. I don't know what to do. Can you come stay with me?""
Caleb slammed on the brakes. He spoke into the phone reassuringly.
""Wait for me at the hospital. I'll be right there.""
After hanging up, Caleb looked at Kimberly gravely.
""Kim, take a taxi home yourself. Kate needs me.""
Kimberly let out a cold laugh.
""Are you a doctor? What can you do for her mother if you go?""
Caleb's face instantly became gloomy.
""Kimberly, Sarah is suffering severe complications precisely because of your botched surgery. I'm just trying to make up for your mistake.""
With that, Caleb got out, walked around, and opened Kimberly's car door.
""Get out!""
Looking at the man before her, Kimberly felt nothing but bitterness. So, love really could be faked.
The moment she stepped out, Caleb eagerly started the car and sped away, leaving her alone on the unfamiliar street.
It was near the suburbs, desolate and uninhabited, with no taxis in sight.
As dusk began to fall, Kimberly started walking forward. Suddenly, several large men emerged from a lane entrance.
Kimberly watched them warily, a sense of foreboding washing over her. She turned to run, but found her path blocked.
""Well, isn't this the sister of that recent porn star? I bet you are also a sexy lady!""
One of them grabbed Kimberly's hand. She tried to shake him off, but her hand had no strength at all.
""Do you know who I am? If you touch me, I will make you pay!""
The men laughed even more wildly at her struggles and started dragging her deeper into the alley.
""Let's have fun today!""
Kimberly screamed desperately, but the only response was the men's excited laughter.
""Keep screaming, but no one will save you.""
One of them roughly tore at her clothes. Kimberly fought back, sinking her teeth hard into one man's hand, then used all her remaining strength to break free and run towards the alley's entrance.
The men chased after her, but their laughter grew even more triumphant the next moment.
""This is the suburbs. There's nothing behind you but Lake Washington.""
Kimberly looked at the lake beyond the railing behind her. Without almost any hesitation, she jumped.
The icy lake water instantly enveloped her. Faintly, she seemed to hear arguing on the shore.
""That person only said to ruin her, not to kill her! Who's going to take responsibility if she dies?""
Chapter 5
When Kimberly opened her eyes again, she was back at the Archer's house.
She tried to sit up, but a loud crash from the living room stopped her.
Caleb had smashed a vase onto the floor.
""No matter the cost, find those men! If word of this scandal gets out, someone will pay with their life!""
Katherine leaned against Caleb's shoulder, gently stroking his back.
""Caleb, Ms. Gordon is probably a victim.""
When Kimberly's name was mentioned, Caleb's face darkened terrifyingly. He punched the glass coffee table hard.
""Whether she is a victim or not, it's happened now. I can't have a tainted wife.
""What difference is there between her and her sister now?""
Standing in the corner, Kimberly clenched her fists tightly. Caleb's words hurt, causing her unbearable pain and making it hard to breathe.
He hadn't even bothered to ask her, yet he was already convinced she was tainted.
Early the next morning, Kimberly arrived at the memorial service Caleb had arranged for her mother and sister.
In the main hall, she saw their black-and-white portraits on the altar. But they were happily alive just a month ago.
Kimberly stood there, continuously crying, as if only this could slightly ease her pain.
From 8 a.m. until noon, not a single person came to attend the memorial service.
Even Caleb, who had initially promised a grand send-off, was absent.
Kimberly checked the time. It was almost the hour for the burial. Looking at the empty hall, she alone picked up the urns containing her mother's and sister's ashes and walked out.
Just outside the memorial hall, a crowd of reporters suddenly swarmed around her.

1pmhagd,https://i.redd.it/7d38kkgpy67g1.png,He Gave My Million Dollar Bonus to the Intern - does anyone have a link?,"The game I led won an International Award and sold for five hundred million.

The company promised a one million dollar bonus.

On payday, the new intern Sophia Evans took the money instead.

Thinking it was an accounting error, I stormed into the CEO's office.

""Ethan, was there a mistake with the bonus?""

Ethan Winston didn't even look up. ""Chloe, after thorough investigation, Sophia wrote most of the core code.""

""She worked late nights and weekends. What about you?""

""You clock out on time and scroll through your phone. Attitude is everything.""

I almost laughed.

""She's just an intern. Does she even understand code?""

""Enough!"" Ethan cut me off. ""The company's decision is final. I see everyone's performance clearly.""

""If you're unhappy, you're free to leave.""

He slid a resignation letter across the desk.

My heart turned to ice as I signed it immediately.

Before leaving, I threw out one last remark: ""Ethan, next time you have technical issues, ask your hardworking intern Sophia. Don't bother me.""

He smirked, unfazed.

""Sure.""

----

Whispers followed me through the office.

""Look at her face—black as coal.""

""A million dollars, gone. Who wouldn't be furious?""

""Anger won't help. She couldn't keep what she earned. Ethan's right—attitude is everything.""

""Exactly. Sophia burns the midnight oil while Chloe leaves on time. She wanted all the credit? Dream on.""

A shrill voice chimed in—Olivia Lopez, Sophia's close friend: ""She relied on seniority and failed. Serves her right!""

""True. She thought the project would collapse without her, but Sophia's code is even better. Her 'lead developer' title was inflated.""

""I heard she kept visiting the hospital last month. Family issues?""

""Please. Everyone has problems. Is she special?""

""This company values dedication. Sophia is the role model.""

""Chloe couldn't keep up. Her exit was inevitable.""

""Sophia earned that million. It's deserved—a reward for young talent.""

""Some people should step aside for the new generation.""

Their words dripped with schadenfreude.

They forgot my nine years of all-nighters, technical breakthroughs, and building teams from scratch.

All they saw was my ""punctuality"" this past month.

Especially Olivia, who once called me her sister. Now she led the chorus.

She ranted about how I was ""dead wood"" and ""virtue does not match position.""

Enough.

I stopped, turned, and marched to Olivia's desk.

Mid-sneer, she froze as I spotted her ""Company Excellence"" mug—a souvenir from last year's big project that I led.

I grabbed it and smashed it on the floor.

CRASH.

Shards flew. The office fell silent.

All whispers and pointed fingers ceased.

Olivia's face flushed, then paled. Her lips trembled, speechless.

I scanned the room. Everyone averted their eyes, suddenly busy.

Without a word, I turned and walked to my private office through the suffocating silence.

Inside, I began packing my belongings.

My fingers brushed an old photo frame—a team picture after our first successful game test.

Back then, everyone smiled genuinely, eyes bright with passion.

Now, everything had changed.

Rage gave way to deeper sorrow.

Nine years. My prime years, given to this place.

Countless nights, I was the last to turn off the lights.

Countless weekends, I debugged servers alone.

Countless challenges, I led the team through the toughest problems.

The award-winning game? Its core architecture, original vision, and hardest algorithms—every line bore my effort.

Last month, my mother was hospitalized in critical condition.

The game's main development was done, leaving only routine tasks.

Stretched thin, I delegated.

Sophia, the seemingly diligent intern, volunteered to take more work so I could care for my family.

Grateful, I assigned her the simpler tasks and praised her initiative in meetings.

But to Ethan, those tasks became ""core code.""

And my reduced overtime became ""laziness"" and ""leaving on time.""
Chapter 2
The door creaked open slightly.

Sophia Evans slipped in sideways, gently closing it behind her.

She wore a cream-colored dress today, her hair loosely tied back, with just the right amount of apology in her expression.

""Chloe...""

Her voice was soft, as if afraid of disturbing something.

She walked to the desk, clasping her hands in front of her, head slightly bowed.

""I've thought about it for a long time... I don't think I should take that bonus.""

""The project's success was mostly your doing. I just got lucky... I want to return the money to you.""

I was packing the last few books into a cardboard box.

At her words, my fingers paused.

I remembered when she first started as an intern, always hovering by my workstation with her notebook, asking basic questions.

Her voice had been timid, her eyes skittish—like a deer easily startled.

""Sure.""

I straightened up, pulled out my phone, unlocked it, and opened the payment QR code.

I held the glowing screen toward her.

""Transfer it now. I have time.""

Sophia's expression froze.

The guilt in her eyes receded like a tide, revealing the jagged rocks beneath.

She stared at my phone screen, her lips slowly curling into a smirk.

""Chloe, I was just being polite. Did you actually take me seriously?""

She took half a step back, leaning against the desk and crossing her arms.

""That one million dollar bonus was personally approved by Mr. Winston. He recognized my skills and contributions.""

""I wrote the core code. I pulled all-nighters. For two weeks before the launch, I practically lived in the office.""

""Why do you think the money should go to you?""

As she spoke, her gaze swept across the office—the floor-to-ceiling windows, the solid wood bookshelves, the wide black leather executive chair.

Something burned in her eyes.

""Actually, I should thank you.""

""If you hadn't taken such a long leave of absence because of your family issues, Mr. Winston wouldn't have let me step in temporarily.""

""This office... will be mine from now on.""

I looked at her.

At this face that was both familiar and foreign.

""Skills?""

I took a step forward.

""You mean the skill of renaming the parameters in my debugged interface, reformatting the comments, then packaging the test cases I organized as 'core algorithms' and submitting them?""

""Or the skill of always typing irrelevant code or pulling up pre-written documentation whenever Mr. Winston walked past your desk?""

My voice was flat, devoid of inflection.

The color drained from Sophia's face.

She opened her mouth, then closed it again.

Her fingers tightened unconsciously around the hem of her dress.

""You—you're lying!""

Her voice rose, trembling noticeably.

""Whether I'm lying or not, you know the truth,"" I said. ""The 'core modules' you submitted? The underlying function calls and logical structure are identical to the framework I built.""

""You just wrapped them in clumsy encapsulation and added flashy comments.""

""Should I line up the original design draft with your so-called 'achievements' and post them on tech forums for our peers to judge?""

Sophia turned completely pale.

Her greatest weakness was her shaky technical foundation.

Ethan Winston didn't understand code—he was easily fooled by appearances.

But those who truly knew the industry had sharp eyes.

She bit her lower lip, her gaze darting around nervously.

Then, her eyes landed on the wooden photo frame at the corner of the desk.

Inside was a picture of me and my mother, taken last spring by West Lake.

Sophia suddenly reached out as if to steady herself against the desk, but her elbow ""accidentally"" knocked the frame over.

It hit the floor with a crisp shatter of glass.

She stumbled forward, her right foot landing squarely on the broken shards—and my mother's smiling face.

Her heel ground into the photo.

""Oh, I'm so sorry, Chloe. I lost my balance—""

Before she could finish—

Slap!

The sound of the slap exploded in the quiet office.

Sophia reeled sideways, a vivid red handprint blooming on her left cheek.

She clutched her face, staring at me in disbelief.

""Get out.""

I said.

At that exact moment, the office door was flung open.

""Chloe Sullivan, what the hell are you doing?!""
Chapter 3
Ethan Winston stood by the door, his expression dark as storm clouds.

He must have been passing by and stumbled upon this scene.

Sophia Evans instantly switched to her fragile persona, her voice trembling with just the right amount of emotion. ""Mr. Winston... I—I just wanted to apologize to Chloe about the bonus issue.""

""But she reacted so strongly, and then...""

She trailed off, lightly touching her flushed cheek as her eyes instantly welled up with tears.

""Chloe!"" Ethan's voice rose sharply, laced with undisguised anger. ""You've disappointed me!""

""Company decisions are made for a reason. No matter how upset you are, you shouldn’t lay hands on a colleague!""

""Especially when Sophia came here sincerely to apologize!""

""Apologize?"" I bent down and picked up the photograph bearing the imprint of a shoe, my fingers brushing over my mother's smiling face. ""She smashed the only photo I have of my mother and deliberately stepped on it. Mr. Winston, is this what you call a 'sincere apology'?""

Ethan's gaze flickered to the photo, his brow furrowing slightly.

But the hesitation vanished almost instantly, replaced by deeper irritation. ""An old photo frame—broken or not, is it worth acting like a shrew and hitting someone?""

""You’ve let that bonus blind you to basic decency!""

Sophia let out a choked sob at just the right moment, her shoulders trembling like a delicate flower in the wind.

""Mr. Winston, please don’t blame Chloe... Maybe—maybe it really was my fault for being too clumsy with my words...""

Her performance only poured fuel on Ethan’s fury.

""Chloe, I gave you a chance to step back, but you chose to jump.""

""Pack your things and leave the company. Now.""

I didn’t look at him, nor did I acknowledge the fleeting triumph on Sophia’s face.

Kneeling, I gathered the scattered items—a well-worn pen, a company mug bearing the original logo, and a few technical manuals filled with my notes—and placed them carefully into my canvas bag.

My silence and methodical movements seemed to catch them off guard.

They probably expected hysterics, tears, desperate pleas.

I gave them none.

Zipping up the bag, I straightened and walked toward the door.

As I passed Ethan, I paused.

Turning my head slightly, I met his gaze with calm, deliberate words:

""Ethan Winston, remember what you said today.""

""I hope you won’t regret this decision.""

""And I hope Sophia Evans... proves worthy of the 'trust' you’ve placed in her.""

Ethan’s frown deepened, his lips parting as if to retort.

But I didn’t give him the chance. I strode down the hallway, leaving behind the prying eyes and stifling air.

That place had been overdue for a goodbye.

When I got home, my mother had just woken from her nap, flipping through an old photo album in the living room’s sunlight.

Seeing me return early and looking troubled, she set the album aside with concern.

I didn’t hide anything. I told her everything—the resignation, Sophia taking my bonus, the whole mess.

Instead of scolding me, she took my hand in hers, warm and steady, and patted it gently. ""Good riddance. A place that can’t tell right from wrong isn’t worth your time.""

""Money can be earned again. But if you let this break you, I’ll be heartbroken.""

""Don’t rush into another job. I’ve got enough saved for us to live comfortably for a while. Rest, and heal.""

Her words were like a warm bowl of soup on a winter day, slowly melting the ice in my chest.

The next few days passed in a slower rhythm.

Mornings at the market with my mother, watching her expertly pick fresh vegetables, chatting with familiar vendors, haggling with a lively charm.

Mornings in the park, clumsily mimicking elderly regulars practicing tai chi, my stiff movements making her stifle laughter.

Afternoons on the balcony, sipping her treasured jasmine tea, watching white petals unfurl in golden liquid, talking about nothing and everything as time stretched peacefully around us.

This grounded, ordinary life softened the rough edges of my heart, worn down by corporate battles.

And in this sudden stillness, memories of the past years played like a rewinding film—sharp, vivid.

I remembered our first major project after the company’s founding.

To solve a critical technical issue, my small team and I camped in the office conference room.

Two months of takeout, makeshift beds, red-eyed coding marathons.

We not only cracked the problem but optimized the entire framework. That project put us on the map.

Then there was the time a competitor attacked us—stealing code, crashing servers.

My fledgling security team and I worked sixty sleepless hours, tracking the breach, stabilizing the system, counterattacking.

We emerged stronger, our reputation solidified.

And the game that won the International Award—its spark came from a childhood fantasy under summer stars.

Night after night, I built that dream into reality, from crude prototypes to intricate worlds.

Early tests ran on my old desktop at home.

That game carried my soul in its code.

Through these battles, the company grew from a scrappy startup to an industry contender, its value skyrocketing toward an IPO.

Arthur Winston, the founder, was a visionary.

He trusted me completely, often joking to executives, ""If my son Ethan had half Chloe’s grit, I could die in peace. Frankly, I’d rather leave this company to her than him.""
Chapter 4
Back then, Ethan Winston was still studying abroad. Everyone dismissed Old Mr. Winston's drunken words as mere jokes.

But that heavy recognition had once warmed me like winter sunshine, lighting up my heart.

I felt all those late nights and hard-fought battles were worth it.

Then, everything changed overnight.

Old Mr. Winston suffered a sudden heart attack and passed away abruptly.

Ethan, who had spent years abroad studying management and art, was urgently recalled and hastily took over the company.

At first, he treated me with respect.

Whenever technical challenges arose, he would politely seek my advice.

And I gave my all, holding nothing back.

But gradually, the company's culture shifted.

His approach became the new standard.

Flashy PowerPoint presentations and dramatic reports became the norm.

The number of hours your workstation light stayed on after hours became the measure of ""dedication.""

Weekend team-building attendance mattered more than project progress.

Solid code and hard-won algorithms seemed to pale in comparison to a single ""Brilliant move, Mr. Winston.""

I'm stubborn—I only care about technical excellence.

I was always slow to catch on to these political games.

I naively believed that doing good work would naturally lead to recognition.

Until that one-million-dollar bonus hit me like a blunt strike to the head.

Only then did I wake up completely.

Ethan never wanted a technical backbone who could fight tough battles.

What he wanted was a perfect symbol of his ""corporate culture,"" a compliant ""role model.""

Sophia Evans just happened to fit his aesthetic.

On the day my one-month break ended, I reopened my long-dormant job-hunting profile.

I polished my resume and sent it to several gaming companies known for their technical prowess.

With my experience and proven projects, I was initially confident.

But reality quickly doused me with cold water.

Most applications went unanswered.

A few scheduled interviews—technical discussions went well, with the interviewers visibly impressed. But once HR got involved, their attitudes turned vague.

Either they hesitated awkwardly or simply ghosted me.

After several rejections, a former protégé secretly messaged me.

""Chloe, someone's spreading rumors about you in the industry.""

""They're saying you have terrible character—that you bully newcomers, steal credit, and even have violent outbursts.""

""Now, companies shake their heads the moment they hear your name.""

My fingers turned cold around the phone.

Of course.

Ethan wasn't just forcing me out—he wanted to ruin my career entirely.

When my mother noticed I hadn't eaten properly for days, she finally pressed me for answers.

I gave her the short version.

Tears welled up in her eyes instantly. She grabbed her coat and stormed toward the door.

""I'm going to confront him! I'll make a scene at their company! They can't treat people like this!""

I caught her hand and gently guided her back to the sofa.

""Mom, don't rush.""

Gazing out the window at the bustling traffic, I kept my voice calm.

""The timing isn't right yet.""

""Just wait a little longer.""

""He'll come begging.""

My mother stared at me, her eyes full of worry and confusion.

Just as she was about to speak, my phone on the coffee table rang violently.

Ethan Winston's name flashed glaringly on the screen.

I answered and put it on speaker.

""Chloe!"" His voice crashed through the line, stripped of its usual composure, raw with panic. ""Get to Nanxin Technology right now!""

""The game crashed during the final demo! The client is furious—it's almost a physical fight here!""

""You have to fix this today! Immediately!""

The background noise was chaos—objects being thrown, heated shouting.

I listened quietly.

Only after his outburst did I respond, my voice steady, without a ripple of emotion.

""Mr. Winston, are you calling the wrong person?""

""My resignation was approved, my final paycheck cleared. We're settled.""

""For technical issues, shouldn't you call your million-dollar, ever-'perfectly aligned' Sophia Evans?""",1,1765727600.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

What we have here is what I believe to be a 2022 Czech Republic Lunch Menu 1, and yes, it's a vegitarian main! This one is from the older generation, as the newer Czech rations are still modular but colored much differently.

Don't be deceived by the appearance, I can assure you these Czech rations are of the upmost of quality and flavor.

Pic 1 shows the main dish, in this case, it's vegitarian Dhal, a 340 gram portion, which is quite a lot! Also shown is the supporting crisp bread, and you get 2 entire packs of that! This stuff is super flavorful, savory, and very ""stick-to-your-ribs"" esque. I had no desire to grab salt or pepper. This was eaten hot, boiled for about 14 min in the retort pouch, and then basically spread on an entire pack of the crisp breads. 459 kcal in the main and 117 kcal on the crisp breads. 

Pics 2 shows one of the most interesting items I've ever had from a ration; it's a beet salad! Mostly beets, peas, and carrots. For the love of all things holy, you do NOT want to spill this all over your Sunday best, lest you look like you just processed a deer in the woods or something. This is vinegar based, so super tangy! Fantastic texture and such a fresh dish! A true experience to try and it was 100% consumed. 

Pics 3-8 show packaging and contents. A very nice spread with fantastic supporting snacks! Even comes with a huge FRH.

Pic 9 shows the orange beverage base. Very muted flavor,  even when prepared with far less water than the 1 L it called for. I'd probably do it in 500 mL next time. 

Pic 10 shows the coffee. This was dumped into a morning protein shake and seemed to taste just fine in that. That's how I consume most military coffee I get, one packet into a chocolate peanut butter Reeses Protein shake (C4 is the company).

Pic 11 shows the delightfully crispy Crisp Bread! I love this stuff. I did not grown up on these extruded product crisp breads, but wow, that texture is so nice to me! I had these while walking 10 miles in my mall yesterday morning due to bad weather. In this case, I put strawberry jam from a US ration on them!

Pic 12 shows the chocolate bar! Perfect condition with no bloom at all. This bar was amazing. I liken it to tossing a handful of Nestlé Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chips into your mouth. Wonderful flavor, great snap, and a very nice mouth feel. It def did not melt away in the mouth, you needed to chew it to get that process started. 192 kcal I think this was. Again, eaten while walking.

Pic 13 shows the Food Force fruit and nut mix. Totally fresh and a fantastic blend of various nuts and fruits. They did not skimp on this one, even had cashews, walnuts, and coconut in it! Eaten right after the walk in the car. 182 kcal I think.

I've had several Czech rations before and they have always been fantastic! A very underrated series of rations for sure. I have 3 more of the newer style to eat later! A great meal and I'm thankful I got to try it. Shout-out to Jono from Greeklish Outdoors for reviewing this menu and sparking my interest in it!

1pmha2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1pmha2m/strattera_changed_my_life/,Strattera changed my life," I’ve spent the past few weeks reading as many Strattera (atomoxetine) posts as I could find, and I wanted to share my experience as a counterpoint to the amount of negativity it tends to get here on Reddit.

My goal isn’t to convince anyone that Strattera is amazing or that it will work for you. ADHD meds work very differently for everyone, so my main point is this: please don’t let others’ good or bad experiences scare you off. It might take time, it might need to be combined with a stimulant, or it might not work at all. But don’t rule it out solely because of others’ bad experiences.

I was diagnosed with ADHD (combined type) in college, when I first started struggling academically. At the time, my main concern was focus and motivation, and Adderall XR worked well. It pushed my system into overdrive and helped me keep up with my engineering peers.

Fast forward about 12 years. My dose had more than doubled. I was relying on nicotine and caffeine to keep up with work and life, THC and CBD to relax, sleeping terribly (5 to 6 hours on a good night), crashing mentally by 2 or 3 pm every day, and stuck in a cycle of overwork and burnout that seriously impacted my life. The past few years have been bleak.

I tried breaks, B vitamins, energy supplements, keto (which I stayed on for years and helped somewhat with focus and sugar cravings), Vyvanse, Ritalin, and bupropion. Nothing really improved my situation.

About a month ago, after digging more deeply into my symptoms and reading a few posts from people Strattera actually helped, I decided it was worth trying a non-stimulant. I had been very resistant due to bad experiences with SSRIs earlier in life, and Strattera seemed especially hated online. But at that point, I felt like I had little to lose.

I talked with my doctor, reduced my current stimulant (Vyvanse), and started on 18 mg of Strattera, taken with a protein-rich breakfast.

I wasn’t expecting this, but within an hour or two I could tell something major was happening. I’m a mid-30s male, and I cried. My mind was quiet, calm, and still unlike anything in my wildest dreams.

I didn’t realize how much constant background stress, anxiety, and mental noise I had been living with for years. I didn’t realize how difficult emotional regulation had been, or that it was possible to let small things go without them ruining my day. I didn’t realize how hyperaroused my nervous system had been, or how long it had been since I felt genuinely calm.

I also didn’t realize I had been confusing social anxiety with introversion until I found myself casually chatting with cashiers, neighbors, and strangers.

I always thought I was addicted to sugar and used nicotine, caffeine, and weed to self-medicate. What shocked me was that I immediately felt no desire for any of them.

It’s only been two weeks, but I already feel like a much better version of myself. Someone who didn’t realize how heavy the burden was until it was lifted.

There were side effects. The first few nights were horrible, with chills, sweats, and insomnia. My bp increased slightly and I’m drinking TONS of water. But the major side effects have mostly resolved.

In two weeks, I’ve had no weed or nicotine, one coffee a day, minimal alcohol, almost no sugar cravings, and I’m eating less in a healthy way. I feel calm and peaceful. My memory is better. I’m constantly pinching myself it’s almost too good to be true.

1pmha01,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmha01/youre_probably_mispronouncing_half_the_words_you/,You're probably mispronouncing half the words you say (because you don't know the 5 short vowels),"I work with non-native professionals every day, and I see the same pronunciation mistakes constantly: people turn ""snack"" into ""snake"" or ""full"" into ""fool"" without even realizing it.

Here's what nobody explains clearly upfront.

**The problem with short vowels:**

Mastering American English pronunciation hinges on a solid grasp of its vowel sounds, particularly the five short vowels: /æ/ (as in *cat*), /ɛ/ (as in *bed*), /ɪ/ (as in *sit*), /ɑ/ (as in *hot*), and /ʌ/ (as in *cup*).

For non-native professionals, mispronouncing these sounds can lead to significant misunderstandings in high-stakes environments like board meetings, client presentations, and patient consultations, where clarity directly impacts effectiveness and credibility.

I see this constantly: accomplished professionals with excellent grammar and vocabulary who sound unclear because they're confusing these five core sounds. They say ""Look at the cot"" when they mean ""Look at the cat."" They pronounce ""full"" like ""fool.""

These aren't minor errors—they change meaning entirely.

**What short vowels actually are (and why they matter):**

Short vowels are single, quick vowel sounds that don't glide or change. Unlike diphthongs (which involve mouth movement), short vowels hold one position.

The challenge? English has five vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) but these five letters produce way more than five sounds. The ""short"" versions of these vowels are specific sounds that appear in the most common English words.

Here's the critical insight: When a single vowel is ""closed in"" or sandwiched between two consonants in a simple three-letter pattern (called CVC - Consonant-Vowel-Consonant), it almost always makes its short sound.

Think: *cat*, *bed*, *sit*, *hot*, *cup*.

This pattern is predictable and reliable—unlike most English spelling rules.

**The 5 short vowels you must master:**

Let me break down each one with actionable practice drills.

**1. Short 'A' /æ/ (as in ""cat""):**

This is the vowel in *cat*, *map*, *plan*, *cash*, *last*.

**Mouth position:** Drop your jaw low and wide, almost like you're at the dentist saying ""Ahh."" Your tongue stays flat and low.

**Common challenge:** Many learners substitute this with /ɛ/ (short 'E') or /ʌ/ (short 'U'), making ""cat"" sound like ""cut"" or ""bad"" sound like ""bed.""

**Quick tip:** The key is jaw position. For /æ/, your jaw should drop significantly. Place your hand under your chin—you should feel your jaw lower noticeably.

**Practice drills:**

*CVC words:*

* cat, bat, map, tap, plan, last, cash, fast

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /ʌ/):*

* cat / cut
* bat / but
* dad / dud
* sack / suck

*Phrases:*

* ""A fast plan""
* ""The last cash payment""
* ""Sam had a snack""

*Sentences:*

* ""The man had a fast plan for the staff""
* ""Can you pass the bag on the mat?""

**2. Short 'E' /ɛ/ (as in ""bed""):**

This is the vowel in *bed*, *yes*, *test*, *web*, *help*.

**Mouth position:** Your jaw is moderately open (not as wide as /æ/). Your tongue is in the mid-front position. Your lips are relaxed and unrounded.

**Common challenge:** Confusion with /ɪ/ (short 'I'), making ""pen"" sound like ""pin"" or ""set"" sound like ""sit.""

**Quick tip:** Think of the mouth position as halfway between the wide-open /æ/ and the more closed /ɪ/. Say ""bed"" and feel where your tongue sits—mid-height, relaxed.

**Practice drills:**

*CVC words:*

* bed, yes, test, web, help, desk, egg, end

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /ɪ/):*

* pen / pin
* set / sit
* met / mit
* led / lid

*Phrases:*

* ""The best test""
* ""Help desk""
* ""Yes, the red pen""

*Sentences:*

* ""The desk at the end is the best""
* ""Yes, I met the men at ten""

**3. Short 'I' /ɪ/ (as in ""sit""):**

This is the vowel in *sit*, *fix*, *list*, *win*, *big*.

**Mouth position:** Your mouth is more closed than for /ɛ/. Your tongue is high and front, but relaxed (not tense like the long 'E' in ""see""). Your lips are slightly spread.

**Common challenge:** Confusion with the long /iː/ (as in ""seat""), making ""sit"" sound like ""seat"" or ""ship"" sound like ""sheep.""

**Quick tip:** The difference between /ɪ/ (short) and /iː/ (long) is tension and length. For /ɪ/, keep your mouth and tongue relaxed. For /iː/, smile and create tension. Practice saying ""sit"" (relaxed) vs. ""seat"" (tense).

**Practice drills:**

*CVC words:*

* sit, fix, list, win, big, pig, did, him

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /iː/):*

* sit / seat
* ship / sheep
* bit / beat
* live / leave

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /ɛ/):*

* pin / pen
* bid / bed
* did / dead

*Phrases:*

* ""A big list""
* ""Did he win?""
* ""Fix it quickly""

*Sentences:*

* ""The big pig did win the list""
* ""Sit still and finish the drill""

**4. Short 'O' /ɑ/ (as in ""hot""):**

This is the vowel in *hot*, *job*, *stop*, *lot*, *rock*.

**Mouth position:** Your jaw is dropped and open. Your tongue is low and back. Your lips are unrounded (in American English—this differs from British English).

**Common challenge:** Confusion with /ʌ/ (short 'U'), making ""not"" sound like ""nut"" or with /ɔ/ (as in ""caught""), making ""cot"" sound like ""caught.""

**Quick tip:** For American English /ɑ/, think ""ah"" sound like at the doctor's office. Your mouth is wide open, tongue low and relaxed in the back.

**Practice drills:**

*CVC words:*

* hot, job, stop, lot, rock, dog, log, pop

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /ʌ/):*

* not / nut
* cot / cut
* Don / done
* robber / rubber

*Phrases:*

* ""A hot job""
* ""Stop at the lot""
* ""The dog on the log""

*Sentences:*

* ""The hot coffee is on the top shelf""
* ""Don stopped at the shop to get a mop""

**5. Short 'U' /ʌ/ (as in ""cup""):**

This is the vowel in *cup*, *fun*, *luck*, *must*, *run*.

**Mouth position:** Your jaw is moderately open (similar to /ɛ/). Your tongue is in the mid-central position—neither front nor back, neither high nor low. It's the most neutral, relaxed position.

**Common challenge:** Confusion with /ɑ/ (short 'O'), making ""cut"" sound like ""cot"" or confusion with /ʊ/ (as in ""put""), making ""but"" sound like the vowel in ""book.""

**Quick tip:** This is often called the ""schwa's stressed cousin."" It's that neutral ""uh"" sound you make when you're thinking (""uh... let me think""). But it's stressed, so it's clearer and more defined than the unstressed schwa.

**Practice drills:**

*CVC words:*

* cup, fun, luck, must, run, bug, jug, rug

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /ɑ/):*

* cut / cot
* but / bot
* done / Don
* nut / not

*Minimal pairs (contrast with /ʊ/):*

* but / book
* luck / look
* stuck / stook (rare word, but useful for contrast)

*Phrases:*

* ""Good luck""
* ""Must run""
* ""A fun bug""

*Sentences:*

* ""The bug must run under the rug""
* ""We must trust the judge on this stuff""

**Systematic practice approaches (how to actually master these):**

Don't try to practice all five at once. That's overwhelming and inefficient.

**Week-by-week progression:**

**Week 1: Focus on /æ/ (cat)**

* Practice CVC words daily
* Record yourself
* Compare to native speaker pronunciation

**Week 2: Add /ɛ/ (bed) + contrast with /æ/**

* Practice minimal pairs (cat/cut, bat/bet)
* Focus on jaw position differences

**Week 3: Add /ɪ/ (sit) + contrast with /ɛ/ and /iː/**

* Practice minimal pairs (sit/set, sit/seat)
* Focus on tongue tension

**Week 4: Add /ɑ/ (hot) + contrast with /ʌ/**

* Practice minimal pairs (not/nut, cot/cut)
* Focus on tongue position (back vs. central)

**Week 5: Add /ʌ/ (cup) + review all five**

* Mixed practice with all five vowels
* Create sentences using multiple short vowels

**Daily practice routine (10-15 minutes):**

1. **Vowel-specific isolation (3 minutes):** Pick one vowel, say 10 CVC words with that sound
2. **Minimal pair contrast (3 minutes):** Practice pairs that confuse you most
3. **Phrase practice (3 minutes):** Say short phrases with your target vowel
4. **Sentence reading (3 minutes):** Read full sentences, record yourself
5. **Self-assessment (3 minutes):** Listen back, compare to native speaker

**The word family approach (accelerated learning):**

Group words by their ending pattern (the ""rime"") while changing the beginning sound (the ""onset"").

**-at family (short 'A'):** cat, bat, hat, mat, sat, rat, fat **-et family (short 'E'):** get, jet, met, set, yet, bet, wet **-ig family (short 'I'):** big, dig, fig, pig, wig, jig **-og family (short 'O'):** dog, fog, hog, jog, log, bog **-ug family (short 'U'):** bug, dug, hug, mug, rug, jug, tug

This pattern-based learning accelerates your ability to recognize and produce short vowels because you're training your mouth with consistent phonetic patterns.

**Multisensory practice (for faster retention):**

Connect each vowel to a physical gesture. This creates multiple neural pathways for remembering the sound.

**Short 'A' /æ/:** Open your fingers wide from a fist (mimicking a wide mouth) **Short 'E' /ɛ/:** Hold a flat, level hand near your chin **Short 'I' /ɪ/:** Hold your index finger and thumb close together **Short 'O' /ɑ/:** Form a circle with your index finger and thumb **Short 'U' /ʌ/:** Point your thumb upward

Practice saying each vowel while making its gesture. This kinesthetic connection helps cement the sound in your muscle memory.

**The practical takeaway:**

The five short vowels are the foundation of clear English pronunciation:

1. /æ/ (cat) - wide jaw, flat tongue
2. /ɛ/ (bed) - moderate jaw, mid-front tongue
3. /ɪ/ (sit) - closed mouth, relaxed high-front tongue
4. /ɑ/ (hot) - open jaw, low-back tongue
5. /ʌ/ (cup) - moderate jaw, neutral central tongue

Practice strategy:

* Master one vowel per week
* Use CVC words for isolation practice
* Practice minimal pairs to train contrast
* Use word families for pattern recognition
* Record yourself daily
* Connect physical gestures to sounds

Focus areas:

* Start with the vowel causing you the most confusion
* Most common confusion: /æ/ vs. /ɛ/, /ɪ/ vs. /iː/, /ɑ/ vs. /ʌ/
* Practice these contrasts until automatic

**What to ignore:**

The idea that you can learn all five vowels simultaneously. You can't. Master one, then add the next.

Also ignore spelling as your guide. English spelling is notoriously unreliable. Focus on the sound, not the letter. The same letter 'A' makes different sounds in ""cat"" (short), ""cake"" (long), and ""car"" (neither).

**The uncomfortable reality:**

Mispronouncing short vowels doesn't just make you sound non-native—it creates actual comprehension barriers.

When you say ""I need to fill this form"" but pronounce ""fill"" like ""feel,"" you've changed the meaning entirely. When you say ""I'll check the list"" but pronounce ""check"" with the wrong vowel, people have to work harder to understand you.

This cognitive friction adds up. In high-stakes professional settings—board meetings, client presentations, patient consultations—this extra effort from listeners can subtly undermine your credibility and authority.

The goal isn't perfection. It's eliminating the friction that prevents your brilliant ideas from landing clearly.

**Key insight:** Short vowels appear in the most common English words. Mastering these five sounds gives you clarity in the vocabulary you use most often—which means maximum impact for your practice time.

By isolating each sound in predictable CVC patterns, you can diagnose and fix specific errors without the distraction of complex spelling or multi-syllable words.

This is foundational work. Get these five sounds right, and everything else in your pronunciation journey becomes easier.",1,1765727568.0,intonetic,0,1.0,False

Hey there, I'm looking for a partner interested in a grounded, character driven, drama filled, police department roleplay. The roleplay would be inspired by shows like SWAT and the Rookie.

Below is a writing sample/background

The conference room at headquarters smelled like old coffee and cleaning solution, the kind that never quite faded no matter how often the floors were scrubbed. Outside the narrow windows, Los Sueños kept moving the way it always did now — sirens somewhere in the distance, a helicopter passing low, the city never fully settling.

Chief Galo Álvarez sat at the head of the table, uniform pressed, posture straight out of habit more than effort. The service stripes on his sleeve caught the light when he shifted his arms. Behind him, a body-camera frame was frozen on the wall, paused mid-hallway, a doorway open to a moment everyone in the room already knew by heart.

He didn’t look at the screen.

His eyes stayed on Captain Daniel Mercer.

“Start from the first decision,” Álvarez said. His voice was calm. Not cold. Just controlled.

Mercer nodded once and took a breath. He didn’t open the folder in front of him. There was no point. “Initial call came in as a domestic disturbance. Prior history at the address. That area’s been unstable since the sanitation strike. Patrol heard a gunshot on arrival.”

Álvarez listened without interrupting.

“We activated under barricaded suspect protocol,” Mercer continued. “Given how things have been citywide, we didn’t assume it was isolated.”

No one challenged that. In Los Sueños, nothing stayed isolated anymore.

“When did you believe someone else was inside?” Álvarez asked.

“Thermal picked up two heat signatures. One moving. One stationary.”

Álvarez tilted his head slightly. “Believed,” he said. “Or confirmed?”

Mercer hesitated, just long enough to feel it. Across the table, Internal Affairs didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Just watched.

“Believed,” Mercer said.

Álvarez nodded once, accepting it. “And the suspect?”

“Communicative. Calm. No demands. Denied anyone else was inside.”

“So he set the pace,” Álvarez said.

“Yes, sir.”

“In a city where people have learned how to use time,” Álvarez added quietly.

Mercer nodded again. “Yes, sir.”

“Did anyone say that out loud?” Álvarez asked.

“Yes.”

Álvarez didn’t ask who. He didn’t need names. He’d been doing this too long for that.

“And you held,” Álvarez said.

“Yes, sir.”

“Because policy told you to,” Álvarez said.

“Yes.”

Frank Delgado, the union rep, leaned forward slightly. “Chief, policy exists to protect everyone involved. Especially now. Every early breach becomes a headline. Every mistake turns into a lawsuit.”

Álvarez looked at him then. “I know, Frank. I’ve been answering for this department since before this city started coming apart.”

He turned back to Mercer. “How long from first contact to the execution?”

“Twenty-three minutes.”

Álvarez let the number sit there. “That’s not a long time,” he said. “But it’s long enough for someone inside to decide how they want the night to end.”

The room went quiet again.

“This wasn’t fear,” Álvarez said. “And it wasn’t incompetence. Your team did what they were trained to do.”

Delgado’s shoulders eased slightly.

“But Los Sueños doesn’t play fair anymore,” Álvarez went on. “People here watch us. They learn. They wait for us to hesitate.”

Internal Affairs stayed silent, their presence heavier than any comment.

“This was a judgment gap,” Álvarez said. “Not because judgment failed, but because the ground keeps shifting under it.”

Delgado spoke carefully. “And for the record, my client isn’t being disciplined for that.”

“He’s not,” Álvarez said without hesitation. “This isn’t disciplinary.”

Álvarez reached forward and shut off the recording. The hallway disappeared from the wall, leaving only the low hum of equipment cooling down.

“Captain Mercer,” he said as he stood, “get your people through their debriefs. Take care of them.”

“Yes, sir.”

Álvarez glanced once at Internal Affairs, then at Delgado. “This review stays what it is,” he said. “An honest accounting.”

When he left the room, no one followed.

Álvarez closed the door to his office and stood there for a moment, one hand resting against the wood. The noise of the building faded to a dull background hum. Phones. Radios. The city asking for more than it ever gave back.

He sat at his desk and rubbed a hand over his face. The meeting replayed itself in pieces. Twenty-three minutes. Silence. A hallway that led nowhere good.

Policy wasn’t going to catch up fast enough.

Álvarez picked up his desk phone and dialed a number he hadn’t called in a while. It rang twice.

“Álvarez,” he said when it connected. “It’s Galo.”

A pause. Then a voice he knew well enough to hear the years in it.

“Figured Los Sueños would get around to calling,” the man said.

“It hasn’t beaten me,” Álvarez said. “But it’s trying.”

“What happened?”

“Barricade turned into an execution,” Álvarez said. No decoration. “By the book. Still went bad.”

Silence on the other end. The professional kind.

“You looking for resources?” the man asked.

“I’m looking for perspective,” Álvarez said. “Someone who’s seen cities where hesitation gets people killed and speed gets people sued. Someone who can sit with my people and tell them what we’re missing.”

Another pause.

“You asking officially?”

Álvarez looked out the window at the city he’d spent his life in. “Not yet,” he said. “I’m asking you.”

A quiet breath on the line. “You’re thinking HRT.”

“I’m thinking a liaison,” Álvarez said. “Someone who won’t try to take over.”

There was a short, humorless chuckle. “I might know someone.”

“Send him,” Álvarez said. “Before this city teaches us the same lesson twice.”

The line went dead.

Álvarez sat there a moment longer, staring at the phone. Outside, sirens rose again, closer this time.

The brainwashing still haunts me, but I march on ignoring these destructive thoughts and listen to my body and what it wants. I’ve been craving butter madly. So I eat it. 

I just wanted to mention how destructive these ideas that started for me in the 70s, to eat whole grains and be plant based are. I am literally ignoring these thoughts but tell me if I eat this butter that I’m craving, I’m going die of a heart attack later today. Then I feel great, no allergies, no asthma, no fatigue, etc., and I march on. 💪🏼

250g water. 
4.5 on Fellow Ode Gen 2.

Boiled water first then added coffee.

The cup I got was pretty gross - astringent, but not acidic - chalky almost and a bit papery even though I rinsed the filter very well. It just didn't taste anything like a good vibrant and delicious cup I remember. 

It might be my grinder. I have had some issues with this grinder recently, notably some clogging at coarse grinds - so might be a burr misalignment?

Might also be my water quality - but I can get relatively decent v60s. The water I use is the filter water dispenser from my fridge. 

I was gonna pick up some purified water today and see if that's the culprit first before I start troubleshooting with the grinder.

Used my AMEX free night plus points for the trip and our last platinum upgrade night. Got upgraded to an Executive Suite which was a nice corner room with extra room (note the recycling bins turned sideways so my son can play Hockey). 

We used the M Lounge 3 times. Once when we first arrived for some quick snacks and dinner. The staff in the M Lounge was amazing and grabbed my son a chocolate milk and a whole bag of GF chips for my wife to eat with her charcuterie. The desserts were awesome and the nibbles were delicious. The second was during my trip home from the casino where I grabbed some peanuts and water. Third was  after breakfast which had some nice coffees for us and cereal for my son. 

We ate breakfast at Harbourstone where we had the steak and eggs, and the Scallop Bap which were both amazing. My son had the blueberry kids pancakes and he ate (which is always surprising). After breakfast the family tried out the pool. Nice and heated with a shallow hot tub for my son to play in as well. 

We have to shout out the scavenger hunt you can pick up at the front desk. For any kid you can pick up a book and some crayons. There are 4 different locations in the hotel to find and stamp the book. Once you find all of them go back to the front desk and they will award the hard work with a gift from “the pot”. Such a cute idea. No idea how often they do the scavenger hunt but it’s a super cool idea! 

All in all I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels in the Halifax area and I believe this is the best bang for downtown. The only small hiccup was having to park in the parking garage next door instead of at the hotel but the Pedway made it easy to get back to the hotel inside out of the cold.

1pmh43i,https://i.redd.it/ur0wn9ocx67g1.jpeg,Bellerophon Murders (Fallen Kingdom Universe),"The following events occurred in the Fallen Kingdom Universe:

On April 13, 2023, Roman Orlov, a high-ranking operative of the international terrorist group known as “Perseus” was assassinated by a team of private military contractors from Shadow Company.

Shadow Company had been hired by a tech mogul named Jasper Rutledge to assassinate Orlov after evidence emerged that Orlov was involved in a series of corporate espionage cases against Jasper’s company.

One month later, Callie Rutledge, a young barista, a resident of Fall’s End, Montana, and Jasper’s daughter, was kidnapped after her shift at the Caribou Hill Coffee Shop ended. Her captor was Tolis Banoglou, a high-ranking operative of the Russia-based international terrorist and spy ring known as Perseus.

Unbeknownst to the kidnapper, his actions were witnessed by DedSec hacker Hannibal Rathbone, his friend Adam Rorke and Adam’s girlfriend Amber, both of whom were vacationing in Montana at the time, and a mysterious ex-US Army officer turned DedSec hacker going by the name “Bellerophon”.

Rathbone, Halford, Rorke and Bellerophon each pursued Tolis, with all four of them having recognized him; Bellerophon recognized Tolis from an earlier encounter with Perseus three years earlier while Rorke and company recognized Tolis as a dangerous criminal with a long criminal record.

Over the course of four weeks, Halford, Rorke and Bellerophon both launched their own investigations, intending to rescue Callie and uncover Perseus’ motives for kidnapping her.

Rathbone’s team was able to uncover evidence that Callie’s father Jasper was involved in a series of investigations into a terrorist organization named Perseus after the terrorist organization was discovered to be connected to a series of corporate espionage cases against Jasper’s company. Rorke theorized that Callie was targeted as revenge for Jasper’s investigation into Perseus, and that Tolis had been hired by Perseus to kidnap Callie.

Rathbone’s biggest breakthrough was after he interrogated a Perseus informant; the informant confirmed that Callie was targeted because of her father’s previous actions against Perseus, more specifically an assassination mission involving the PMC Shadow Company.

Bellerophon, meanwhile, embarked on a shocking campaign of violence against Perseus, launching a series of one-man raids against various Perseus outposts and safe houses across North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana in a bid to track down Tolis and take him down while also intending to rescue Callie. At one point, he single-handedly wiped out an entire Perseus hit team in the forests of Idaho. 

Tolis, who apparently knew Bellerophon, attempted to murder Callie by burying her alive in a shallow grave before attempting to relocate.

Ultimately, Rathbone and company managed to reach Callie and rescue her after Rorke discovered said shallow grave completely by accident.

Within minutes of saving Callie, Rathbone and company witnessed Bellerophon storming Tolis’ safehouse, burning his place to the ground in the process.

Tolis attempted to kill Bellerophon, leading to a Mêlée à Trois involving Hannibal and his cohorts, Bellerophon, and Tolis and his minions.

During the fight, Bellerophon was able to grievously wound Tolis, who mistakenly believed Rorke and his cohorts were in league with Bellerophon. With his dying breath, Tolis swore that Perseus would seek revenge against both Bellerophon and Hannibal.

Callie was safely returned to her father. Out of gratitude, Jasper offered Hannibal a job at his company. He turned it down, citing “prior commitments.” Adam, however, accepted the job and became an intern.

Bellerophon’s rampage led to the deaths of approximately 2,690 Perseus agents. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, however, the mysterious hacker murdered thousands without reason and law enforcement in Montana considered his actions a domestic terrorist attack. 

Bellerophon became one of the most wanted men in the United States. A manhunt for Bellerophon was launched. 

Bellerophon’s real identity is currently unknown. The police manhunt is currently ongoing.

When I finished grad school, I started working as a freelance consultant in the sciences. I was building my business and increasing in income for the first few years. In 2022 I met my now partner and had a child with him in 2023 (very fast). 

I worked through the pregnancy, started working again postpartum, and was the primary income. I was still EBF, handling night wakes because I was EBF, and partner was providing care during the day. This is where issues began. 

We had fight after fight about him not pulling his weight. I would cool, clean, primary parent, work. He was horrid. I'll never forget the way he treated me in those days. I would cry and beg for help in the morning as I cooked breakfast, made coffee, cared for our baby, and tried to get myself ready. I would show up to work so frazzled and unable to focus. 

This went on for quite awhile in 2024. Earlier this year we bought a house with my parents' help, as they said they would be around more and help with childcare if we moved. This was not the case. 

I finally broke up with my partner. He agreed to make some substantial changes, and got a job, started contributing more financially, and pulling more weight in child and home care. 

I received a complaint from a client that my work was unorganized and therefore overbudget on a project. First complaint. It happened the same week my 19 year old cat died, so I was an absolute mess. Client knew this, but was still upset. 

It was not just my cat dying though, this issue was a result of a lack of support, us working on and moving into the house, then the sadness of my cat passing on top and in the final process for the project. 

Now my work is under funding cuts because it is overall EPA funded, and our contract was delayed 5 months. They're my biggest client. We're in a house that, with my essentially laid off, we can't comfortably afford. My partner works 7 days a week. We could no longer afford a nanny, so trying to find new work is difficult. And I need to beg my parents to help with childcare for meetings I do still have. 

I messed up, I resent my partner, I'm angry at my parents, and we have a house we don't want. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to own a home, but it has caused a massive amount of stress. I feel like my career I worked so hard for is falling apart.

So washed coffees I tend to keep more clean usually and natural more syrupy and with more body, but I switch it up sometimes just to see if my preferences change. How would you approach processes like thermal shock washed, carbonic macerations and anaerobics? 

I’ve kind of went more back and forth on these processes and haven’t found a generally preferred method. I’m especially curious about your approaches to thermal shock Colombians since they have been many of my favourite coffees this year.

New Flat - https://ibb.co/album/zVhjmR

(my flat will be on the first floor facing the opposite direction, this one is on 2nd floor and viewed it as my one is not ready yet. Same layout etc just different view/floor)

Current Flat - https://ibb.co/album/St189Q 

The reason I am making this post is for help on my housing decision because I don't really want to stay here in my city (south East UK) as my life is just stagnant here and theres nothing for me anymore so I want to move back to London asap. If I intended to stay here for life/long term then I think decision is obvious and move to the new place as I do really like it and the building it's in. Since I don't though I feel it might not be worth it

My plan was to basically go somewhere in Europe for a week in January next year, then come back and find a private rent place in London who will accept rent covered by universal credit (My income is supplemented due to disability, etc.) and move

Pros vs Cons

New flat pros:

Bigger, nicer, balcony, bath, can do mutual exchange as this is a HA property (although I would need find someone willing to relocate down here plus find the flat/location suitable PLUS what if it takes a while and the process alone of swapping takes at least a month and a half)

New flat cons:

A bit far out from train station, nothing on the doorstep other than an aldi plus a lidl/range/costa down the road, pay electric energy bills and I really just don't want to move to *another* place after moving around a lot since being back here in my homecity since 2020

Current flat pros:

1) area has several supermarkets and coffee shops e.g. Coffee no1 and a waitrose and genral high street stuff like post office/charity shops  2) back area is across road from train station, 3) don't pay energy bills

Current flat cons:

Neighbour upsatirs who is getting increasingly very annoying and cannot do mutual exchange from this HA flat so my option will be private renting housing for London

I don't want to live in this city for another year to be honest as I turn 29 at the start of the year

So is it worth/a wise decision to move into this flat I have been offered anyway or unnecessary? Is it a no brainer and moving to this nicer flat is obvious?  ",1,1765726868.0,HousingUK,1,1.0,False

I worked in the restaurant industry and he was going to culinary arts school. After about 4 months, he met ""Margo"" and they started dating. 
I thought Margo a fit together with Monty very well. She understood he had a crazy schedule, and when they did have a chance to spend time with one another it was typically at Monty and I's apartment which was fine. I would typically stay in my room read a book or watch TV. Sometimes a friend would come over and we would all play spades. Everything was going pretty good. 
I started noticing that when Margo left any dishes she used she just left wherever she was sitting I didn't think anything of it and just would pick up whatever was there wash what needed washing and throw away what was trash. 
Of course let Monty know after about the third time I was starting to get a little annoyed. Because well to me it's rude to just come to somebody's house whether you're dating them or not and leave dirty dishes and trash in random places instead of scraping your plate rinsing your cup putting it in the sink and throwing a trash in a garbage. Monty said that he would talk to Margo and I left it at that. (Me vocalizing my frustration did not affect our friendship at all BTW).
The problem got so big when they found out she was pregnant and she moved in with us. Of course there was an adjustment for all of us living in the same house together as Monty and I had our own schedules, and we split the chores as best as we could and everything worked out. When Margo moved in though things went to shit pretty quick ( as far as housekeeping goes that is)
I should say at this point that I have OCD and in my 20's it was pretty bad. Though I did not expect anyone to clean as thoroughly as I did, I did expect common courtesy and respect as far as just cleaning up after yourself. I don't know if that was too high of an expectation to me it would be very easy just to pick up after yourself.
With that being said, Margo NEVER cleaned up after herself. And I mean anywhere in the house if she was in the living room watching TV and she was having a snack or multiple snacks she would leave her snack wrappers and dirty dishes wherever she put them, and the kitchen she would turn into a disgusting mess. I did calmly ask multiple times if she could wash her dishes put them in the dish drainer and I would put them away when I cooked and that she put her trash in the trash can. Margo claimed it was because she's pregnant she just could not do it mind you at this point I am almost 7 months pregnant, work a full-time job and then I come home and have to clean up after her because Monty is either at work or at school and I got increasingly more and more angry because she's a grown ass woman and can clean up after her damn self. 
So here is where I might be the asshole:
One day it was early evening I got home late from work because I had to work late and the kitchen was a disaster , I knock on their bedroom door, there was no answer so I knocked again and after getting no answer that time I just kind of cracked the door and said her name and I realized she wasn't home so in my anger I did the following: 
I took all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen including the pots and pans oh I also took all of the trash that was on the counters and the coffee table in the living room and I put them all over their bed, the trash I sprinkled on top of all of the dirty dishes, pots and pans, and silverware like it was garnish on a dinner plate. 
I then went in the kitchen scrubbed it all clean and went to bed. 
Needless to say when I woke up in the morning all of the dishes that I had put in the bedroom were washed and in the dish drainer. Counters and stove we're still spotless. 
When she decided the grace the world with her presence at like 1:00 in the afternoon she saw me and immediately started crying and telling me how I was a horrible person and I made her look bad etc etc etc. Pretty much anything that she thought would make me feel bad, she didn't know me that well or she wouldn't have went through all of that drama cuz well I did not feel bad and I still do not. Guess what though? Never had to worry about dishes and trash ever again. 
I would like to point out that Monty worked full time and was in culinary school full time and I wasn't going to go to him with this nonsense cuz my belief is if you are grown enough to live on your own, make messes, and expect others to clean up after your ass, then you are grown enough to be taught  lesson when talking just doesn't work. And I am not one to go to somebody's spouse and point fingers and act like I'm in kindergarten when I have a grown problem with a grown ass person.

1pmgzac,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmgzac/the_neutral_american_accent_everyone_talks_about/,"The ""neutral"" American accent everyone talks about? It's not what you think (here's what it actually is and why it matters for your career)","I work with non-native professionals trying to sound ""more American,"" and the first thing they ask is: ""What accent should I aim for?""

Here's what nobody explains clearly upfront.

**The problem with ""sounding American"":**

Ever wonder what makes the voices on national news broadcasts or in Hollywood movies sound so clear and universally understood? You're hearing the General American accent in action.

Most people think of it as the ""standard"" or ""neutral"" American accent—the one without any regional flavor. But here's the reality: almost nobody actually speaks this way in real life.

I see this constantly with clients who've been told to ""speak General American"" without understanding what that actually means or why it's useful. They're chasing this mythical ""accent-free"" sound that doesn't really exist.

**What General American actually is:**

Think of it less as a lack of an accent and more as a ""universal key""—a way of speaking that unlocks clear communication across North America and, increasingly, the world.

Often called ""GenAm"" or the ""Standard American Accent,"" General American is really a non-regional dialect. Its greatest strength lies not in what it sounds like, but in what it lacks: the strong, identifiable markers that tie an accent to a specific place.

Unlike the distinct sounds of Boston, New York City, or the Deep South, GenAm comes across as neutral to most American listeners.

This neutrality is exactly what makes it such a powerful tool for professionals—especially non-native speakers. It ensures your ideas, not your pronunciation, become the focus of every conversation.

**How one accent became ""the standard"":**

The story of GenAm is tangled up with the rise of mass media in the 20th century. While its roots are often traced back to the American Midwest, its big break came with the explosion of radio and television.

After World War II, broadcasters needed a clear, accessible form of speech that could connect with audiences from California to Maine. The Midland dialect, with its lack of sharp regional edges, was the perfect candidate.

Media networks adopted it, and by the 1950s, surveys showed over 60% of Americans already considered it the ""standard"" way to speak. By 1940, it dominated 80% of national broadcasts, effectively exporting it to the world.

That influence now extends far beyond TV screens. GenAm has become the unofficial dialect of international business, technology, and academia.

**Why it matters for your career:**

For any professional, getting comfortable with this accent offers some serious advantages:

**Enhanced clarity:** Your message lands exactly as you intend it, without the risk of misinterpretation that can come with strong regional or foreign accents.

**Increased confidence:** When you know you're being understood clearly, you naturally feel more self-assured during presentations, negotiations, or high-stakes client meetings.

**Broader accessibility:** Your ideas resonate with a much wider audience, from colleagues across the U.S. to international business partners.

The goal isn't to erase your identity. It's about adding a strategic communication tool to your professional toolkit—one that ensures you're understood clearly and effectively the first time you speak.

**The core sounds that define General American:**

To really get a handle on this accent, you have to break it down into its most basic parts—the specific sounds that give it that trademark clarity.

**The rhotic 'R' (the most defining feature):**

This might sound like a complex linguistic term, but the idea is actually simple. Rhoticity just means the 'R' sound is pronounced everywhere it appears in a word's spelling.

This is probably the single most recognizable feature that separates the General American accent from many British accents and even some regional American ones.

In General American, the 'R' is never silent. You hear it distinctly at the end of words like *car* and *never*, and right in the middle of words like *hard* and *work*.

Quick comparison:

*Car:* In General American, it's pronounced with a hard /kɑːr/ sound. In a non-rhotic accent (like many in England), it sounds more like ""cah.""

*Hard work:* The 'R' sounds in both words are fully articulated, giving the phrase a strong, crisp quality.

Getting this rhotic 'R' right is a massive step toward sounding more natural. It requires a specific tongue position—curled back just a bit, without touching the roof of your mouth. It'll feel strange at first, but with practice, it becomes second nature.

**Clear vowel distinctions:**

Right after the 'R', vowels are the next piece of the puzzle. English has a ton of vowel sounds, and General American relies on making clear distinctions between them to avoid mix-ups.

Getting a single vowel wrong can completely change a word's meaning.

For instance, the only difference between ""ship"" and ""sheep"" is a short vowel sound (/ɪ/) versus a long one (/iː/). These tiny shifts are everything.

A crucial feature of natural-sounding American speech is how unstressed vowels get reduced to a neutral ""uh"" sound. This is called the schwa (/ə/), and it's the most common sound in all of English.

You hear it in words like *about* (the 'a') and *sofa* (the final 'a').

Using the schwa correctly is the secret to capturing the natural rhythm and flow of the General American accent. Without it, your speech can sound stiff or robotic.

**The T-flap (the casual sound):**

Finally, let's talk about a consonant sound that is a true hallmark of authentic General American: the T-flap. This is what happens when a 'T' sound, caught between two vowels, softens into a light 'D' sound.

This isn't lazy speaking; it's a standard feature that makes speech smoother and faster.

Examples:

* The 'T' in *water* sounds more like /ˈwɑːdər/
* The 'T' in *city* sounds like /ˈsɪdi/
* The phrase *get it* often comes out sounding like ""geddit""

Mastering the T-flap is one of those subtle details that closes the gap between sounding like you're reading from a textbook and speaking with real, conversational fluency.

When you combine it with a strong rhotic 'R' and clear vowels, you get the unmistakable sound of the General American accent.

**How General American compares to regional accents:**

To really get a feel for the clarity of General American, it helps to put it side-by-side with its more colorful regional cousins.

I like to think of GenAm as a foundational color like white or black; its power comes from its neutrality. Regional accents are like vibrant, distinct hues—beautiful and expressive, but you know them the second you hear them.

**Boston accent (the dropped 'R'):**

The classic Boston accent is famously non-rhotic. This means the 'R' gets dropped at the ends of syllables or before a consonant.

General American: ""Park the car."" (Both 'R' sounds are hard and clear.) Boston: ""Pahk the cah."" (The 'R' sounds vanish, replaced by a soft vowel.)

This one feature creates a massive difference in sound and perception. While charming, that non-rhotic 'R' is a powerful regional identifier that General American speech carefully avoids.

**New York City accent (unique vowel sounds):**

A traditional New York accent is also non-rhotic, but its vowels are what truly make it stand out.

A classic example is the vowel in words like ""coffee"" or ""dog."" In General American, this is a relatively open, simple sound. In a traditional New York accent, it often becomes a distinct diphthong—a two-part vowel sound—that comes out closer to ""caw-fee.""

General American maintains consistent, predictable vowel sounds across words. Regional dialects feature vowel shifts and diphthongs that are specific to that area, making them instantly recognizable.

**Southern accent (the drawl):**

The Southern American accent is less about specific vowel or consonant changes and more about intonation and rhythm—what's often called the ""Southern drawl.""

This involves elongating certain vowel sounds and a more melodic, almost musical pitch pattern.

For instance, a word like ""right"" in General American is short and crisp. In many Southern accents, it might be stretched into something like ""raaaht,"" with the vowel sound drawn out.

**Quick comparison:**

|Feature|General American|Southern|New York City|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Rhoticity|Fully rhotic (hard 'R')|Mostly rhotic|Non-rhotic ('R' is dropped)|
|Vowels|Standard and consistent|Often elongated|Unique diphthongs ('caw-fee')|
|Rhythm|Even and stress-timed|Slower, melodic|Faster pace|

The ""neutrality"" of General American isn't an absence of features. Instead, it's a deliberate adherence to a set of phonetic norms that avoid the strong, beautiful, but ultimately regional markers of other dialects.

**The professional advantage (why this matters beyond pronunciation):**

Polishing your American accent is about much more than just pronunciation—it's a genuine strategic career move.

In a globalized world, clear communication is the ultimate currency. Think of the General American accent as a universally understood version of that currency.

Picture yourself leading a virtual call with stakeholders scattered across different continents. When you speak with a familiar rhythm and clarity, you instantly lower the cognitive load for everyone listening.

They can stop trying to decipher your words and start focusing on your message, your data, and your vision. This leads to more productive discussions and quicker buy-in.

**Enhanced credibility and authority:**

In high-stakes situations—like an investor pitch or a board meeting—confidence is everything. A clear, steady accent projects authority and builds trust almost subconsciously.

When your speech flows smoothly and predictably, it signals to listeners that you are in complete command of your subject.

This simple shift removes communication friction that might otherwise create hesitation or doubt in their minds. The result? Your ideas land with more impact, and your arguments become far more persuasive.

**Navigating a global business landscape:**

It's a common misconception that most Americans speak with the General American accent. In reality, it's used by a minority—statistical estimates suggest only about 10-12% of the U.S. population.

So where does its power come from? Global familiarity. Amplified for decades by global media and business, this familiarity is what makes the accent function so well as a professional standard.

Real benefits:

* **Reduced misunderstanding:** Clear pronunciation of industry-specific jargon ensures technical accuracy and helps prevent costly errors
* **Improved networking:** Approaching new contacts at conferences becomes easier when your speech is immediately clear
* **Greater leadership potential:** Leaders who communicate effortlessly are perceived as more capable of guiding diverse, international teams

The core benefit is simple: when you remove the barrier of a hard-to-understand accent, you close the gap between your true expertise and how others perceive it.

**Actionable steps to master the accent:**

Moving from knowing about the accent to actually doing it can feel like a massive jump. But for busy professionals, it's not about finding extra hours in the day.

The secret is weaving smart, consistent practice into the routine you already have.

**Start with active listening:**

Before you can make the right sounds, you have to be able to hear the right sounds. This is where active listening comes in.

It's way more than just having English-language media playing in the background; it's about consciously tuning your ear to the specific rhythms, pitches, and individual sounds of the General American accent.

Gold mines for active listening:

* **NPR broadcasts:** National Public Radio anchors are trained for vocal clarity and stick closely to standard American accent
* **Podcasts with clear narration:** Shows like ""This American Life"" or ""Freakonomics Radio"" have hosts with crisp, easy-to-follow speech patterns
* **Audiobooks:** Look for non-fiction books read by the author or a professional narrator

As you listen, zoom in on one thing at a time. One day, you might listen only for the rhotic 'R'. The next, you could track how speakers use the T-flap in words like ""water"" or ""city.""

**Embrace the shadowing technique:**

Once your listening skills are getting sharper, it's time to start talking. One of the absolute best methods for this is called shadowing.

The idea is simple: you mimic a native speaker in real-time, repeating what they say almost as soon as you hear them say it.

Shadowing is a game-changer because it forces you to match not just the pronunciation, but the entire package—the rhythm, stress, and intonation of the speaker.

When you first try shadowing, don't stress about catching every single word perfectly. Your goal is to capture the melody and cadence of the speech. Focus on the flow, not just the isolated sounds.

**Use targeted drills for problem sounds:**

While shadowing helps with the big picture, targeted drills are your secret weapon for conquering those specific sounds that trip up most non-native speakers.

Classic exercises:

*Minimal pair drills:* Practice words that differ by only a single sound.

* Ship vs. Sheep (to practice the /ɪ/ and /iː/ vowel sounds)
* Sit vs. Seat (another great pair for short vs. long vowels)
* Thin vs. Fin (to nail the difference between ""th"" and ""f"" sounds)

*Tongue twisters for the American 'R':*

* ""Around the rugged rock, the ragged rascal ran""
* ""The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday""

*Poetry and prose reading:* Reading out loud is fantastic. Poetry, with its built-in rhythm and meter, is especially good for internalizing the musical side of the accent.

The real key is consistency. A focused 15-20 minutes of practice every day will do far more than a long, two-hour session once a week.

**The practical takeaway:**

General American is a non-regional dialect that prioritizes clarity over regional flavor. It's the accent you hear on national news and in Hollywood movies.

Core features to master:

1. **Rhotic 'R':** Pronounce 'R' everywhere it appears (*car*, *work*, *hard*)
2. **Clear vowel distinctions:** Differentiate short vs. long vowels (*ship* vs. *sheep*)
3. **The schwa:** Use the neutral ""uh"" sound in unstressed syllables (*about*, *sofa*)
4. **The T-flap:** Soften 'T' to 'D' between vowels (*water* → ""wader,"" *city* → ""ciddy"")

Practice strategy:

* **Active listening:** NPR, podcasts, audiobooks—focus on one feature at a time
* **Shadowing:** Mimic native speakers in real-time to capture rhythm and flow
* **Targeted drills:** Minimal pairs, tongue twisters, reading aloud (15-20 minutes daily)

**What to ignore:**

The idea that you need to eliminate your original accent. The goal is accent modification, not elimination. Your accent is part of who you are—it tells the story of your background.

You're learning a specific way of speaking for situations where absolute clarity is a must, like high-stakes presentations or global team calls. The real objective is to speak so clearly that your listeners focus on what you're saying, not how you're saying it.

Also ignore the myth that most Americans speak General American. Only about 10-12% of the U.S. population uses it consistently. Its power comes from global familiarity through media and business, not from being the most common accent in daily American life.

**Common questions:**

""How long does it take to learn?"" → With focused practice of 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times per week, most professionals see real improvements in clarity and confidence within 3-6 months. Getting to where it feels completely natural often takes a year or more.

""Is the goal to eliminate my original accent?"" → No. The goal is adding a powerful tool to your professional toolkit. You're learning to code-switch—using General American for work while keeping your natural accent for personal contexts.

""What are the best free resources?"" → NPR broadcasts, podcasts like ""This American Life,"" YouTube channels like Rachel's English, and your smartphone's voice recorder for self-review.

**The uncomfortable reality:**

Mastering General American isn't about sounding like someone you're not. It's about removing communication friction so your expertise can shine through in every professional interaction.

When you speak with clarity and confidence, stakeholders focus on your message instead of expending mental energy decoding your pronunciation. That's the real advantage—not sounding ""American,"" but being understood effortlessly the first time you speak.

1pmgx1n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmgx1n,Boiler/bathroom questions,"Hello plumbers,

I had a plumber (UK, Midlands) in to fit a new boiler and re-do a bathroom. There seem to be quite a few finish issues, and so I am looking for opinions and he has asked me to leave a review. I'm not sure I'm very impressed, but he seemed very proud, and seemed upset when i criticized his joinery, so I'm not sure if I'm being unfair. Started great, but really started to question parts of it and frankly, was just done with them by the end. Parts are from Clifton Bathrooms, whom I have learnt a lot about their business practices recently and don't think I would use them again. Excellent communication when after money, very poor otherwise. The whole thing has been a massive learning experience (maybe for them too).

Boiler - £3.5k cost with new valves on 9 radiators. Condensate now going into bath waste pipe rather than out of wall. New gas pipe running to it as the previous one was apparently too thin. Boiler is Worcester Greenstar 4000 30 kW Combi.

Bathroom completely gutted and redone £6.1k + £2.8k for the actual suite.

New vertical radiator in living room £684

Which tbh all seems quite expensive, but i could only get this guy and we were in a hurry to get the boiler done. We did not rush him at all though or impose any timescale - whole thing took about a month.

As I know little to nothing about boilers and plumbing, I wonder if there is anything obvious about the pipework etc. that looks odd here? 

Particularly, the side panel on the bath seems loose (been back to remedy already with more sealant - pic 4) and the hose beneath the bath is not attached to the wall either (pic 2+3) - they said these are ok, but I am starting to wonder.

The door is the original door, but they did not want to finish that for some reason. The 'architrave' looks like molding/beading to me. Managed to cut the bottom of the door at an angle, broke the hook off and chucked part of the bolt away with the old architrave. The bolt hole is just drilled into the beading, and the lock doesn't actually work at all now - which tbh I found quite funny as he seemed very proud of his 'solution' (pics 6 + 7). 

Particularly in pic 6 - does anyone know how the hole at the bottom should be fixed? It goes behind the plasterboard.

Also I had to paint the ceiling part way through for some reason - just said they don't do that. Regularly only one was working, so had to help them shift the old cast iron bath, chase cables through the loft. Gave them about 10 rolls of kitchen roll and infinite tea and coffee, so I don't feel I've been a bad customer.

There is a small hole in one of the panels that they just put some grey sealant in without telling me which is pretty annoying. The silicone around the top of the room barely touches across to the panels from the ceiling and there are some gaps there too. Some of the siliconing is really neat, some is really bad.

1pmgwvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pmgwvp/i_monitor_security_cameras_for_a_living_one_of/,I Monitor Security Cameras For a Living. One of Them Is Showing Me Right Now.,"I work for a security monitoring company. We watch feeds for small businesses. Gas stations, storage facilities, parking garages. Places too cheap to hire actual security guards. 

My job is to sit in a windowless office and watch twelve monitors. Each monitor cycles through feeds from different clients. If I see something worth flagging, theft or vandalism or someone passed out in a bathroom, I clip the footage and send it to the client. Otherwise I just watch.

I work the overnight shift, 11 PM to 7 AM. Four nights a week. The pay is terrible but I can do homework between incidents and nobody bothers me.

Last month I started seeing things in the feeds that didn't make sense.

Small things at first. A camera would glitch, show static for a few seconds, then come back. Or a timestamp would jump forward, skip a few minutes like the recording had a gap. I mentioned it to my supervisor and she said the system was old, probably corrupted hard drives. She told me to log the glitches and keep working.

The glitches got worse.

Cameras would cut to feeds that weren't in the rotation. I'd be watching the parking garage when the screen would flicker and suddenly I'd be looking at a different location. Empty hallways. Stairwells. Rooms I didn't recognize. Then it would flicker back to the normal feed.

I started logging every anomaly. Times, locations, duration. After two weeks I had thirty-seven incidents. No pattern I could find. Different cameras, different times, always brief. Never more than ten seconds.

Then I saw myself.

It was 3:47 AM on a Tuesday. I was watching a feed from a 24-hour laundromat. The camera points at the front door and the row of washers along the window. 

The screen flickered. The image changed.

I was looking at a kitchen. Small, outdated. Linoleum floor, white cabinets, fluorescent light fixture. A woman stood at the counter with her back to the camera. She was wearing a blue shirt and jeans, pouring something from a pot into a container.

The woman turned around.

It was me.

Same face. Same hair. Same scar on my left eyebrow from when I hit my head on a swing set in third grade. She looked directly at the camera for maybe two seconds, then the feed cut back to the laundromat.

I sat there staring at the monitor. My hands were shaking.

I rewound the footage. Watched it again. Definitely me. Definitely a kitchen I'd never seen before. The timestamp said 3:47 AM, same as the current time, but the date was wrong. It showed a date three days in the future.

I clipped the footage and saved it to my personal drive.

I didn't tell my supervisor. I went home when my shift ended and tried to sleep but I kept seeing that kitchen. The white cabinets. The fluorescent light. I'd never been in that room. I was sure of it.

But the person in the footage was me.

The next night I watched the monitors more carefully. I kept a notebook and wrote down every time a feed glitched. Most were the same as before. Random locations, brief flashes, nothing identifiable. 

At 2:18 AM I saw the kitchen again.

Same room. Same camera angle. This time the kitchen was empty. Just the counter, the cabinets, the light. The footage ran for six seconds, then cut back to the gas station I was supposed to be watching.

I checked the timestamp. Current time, but the date was two days in the future.

I started pulling old footage from the archive. The company keeps everything for ninety days before it's deleted. I went back through six weeks of overnight recordings, looking for anomalies in my shift times.

I found myself in forty-three clips.

Different locations. Different clothes. But always me, always a timestamp that didn't match. Some were in the future. Some were in the past. A few showed dates that hadn't happened yet.

In one clip I was walking down a concrete hallway. Institutional walls, painted cinderblock, heavy doors with wire-mesh windows. I was wearing scrubs. I've never owned scrubs. The timestamp said it was recorded eight months ago.

In another I was sitting in a car. Nighttime. Parked somewhere dark. I was crying. That clip was dated five days from now.

I made copies of everything and tried to find patterns. Times of day. Locations. What I was wearing or doing. Nothing connected. The clips felt random, scattered across months, showing me in places I'd never been doing things I couldn't explain.

Then I found the longest one.

Eighteen minutes of footage from a camera I couldn't identify. It showed a small bedroom. Single bed, dresser, one window with blinds. The timestamp said it was recorded three weeks ago at 4:33 AM.

I was asleep in the bed.

The camera was positioned high, probably mounted in a corner near the ceiling. It had a clear view of the whole room. I watched myself sleep for eighteen minutes. I didn't move much. Occasional shift in position. At one point I rolled over and the blanket slipped down.

At the sixteen-minute mark, I sat up.

Not like I was waking up. More like something had pulled me upright. My eyes were open but I wasn't looking at anything. I got out of bed, walked to the dresser, opened the top drawer. I took something out. I couldn't see what it was. Then I walked out of frame.

The footage continued for two more minutes. Empty room. Unmade bed. Then it cut off.

I didn't recognize the room. Not my apartment. Not anywhere I'd stayed. But it was definitely me in the bed.

I started carrying my phone everywhere, recording myself. If I was somehow sleepwalking or having fugue states, maybe I'd catch myself doing something I didn't remember.

I recorded eight hours a day for a week. Every night before bed, every morning when I woke up. I recorded my whole shift at work, my commute, my time at home.

Nothing unusual. I was exactly where I thought I was, doing exactly what I remembered doing.

But the clips kept appearing in the security feeds.

I saw myself in a parking garage arguing with someone I didn't recognize. I saw myself in what looked like an office building, walking past cubicles at 2 AM. I saw myself standing in an empty field at dusk, just standing there, not moving.

The timestamps were getting closer to the present.

I tried to find the locations. The parking garage looked generic but I drove around checking every multi-level structure I could find. Nothing matched. The office building had no identifying features. The field could have been anywhere.

I thought about going to the police but what would I tell them? That I was seeing myself on security cameras I didn't have access to, in places I'd never been, at times that didn't match reality?

Last week I saw myself in my own apartment.

The feed glitched at 1:23 AM. When it came back I was looking at my living room. Same couch, same bookshelf, same TV. The angle was from the corner near the ceiling, like the camera in the bedroom I didn't recognize.

I was sitting on the couch. Just sitting there, staring at the wall.

I stood up from my desk at work and looked around. I was alone in the monitoring room. The door was closed. I looked at the monitor again.

On the screen, I stood up from the couch in my apartment. I walked to the window and looked out. Then I turned and looked directly at the camera.

My phone was in my pocket. I pulled it out and opened the camera app, switched it to the front-facing view.

I was at work. Fluorescent lights. Gray walls. Monitors behind me showing the feeds.

On the screen, I watched myself in my apartment walk out of frame.

The feed held for another ten seconds, then cut back to the storage facility.

I went home when my shift ended. I checked every room in my apartment. Corners, ceiling, behind furniture. I was looking for cameras. Something had to be recording me.

I didn't find anything.

But I started noticing things that were slightly wrong.

Objects moved. Not far. A cup on the counter six inches to the left. My keys on the coffee table instead of the hook by the door. Books on the shelf in a different order.

Small things. Easy to dismiss as memory errors.

Except I started testing it. Before I went to work, I'd arrange objects in specific patterns. Three pens on the desk in a triangle. Four books stacked with the spines facing out. When I came home, the patterns were different.

Someone was in my apartment while I was gone.

Or I was in my apartment and didn't remember it.

I set up my laptop to record while I was at work. Pointed it at the living room, set it to run all night. When I got home the next morning, I checked the footage.

Seven hours of an empty room. Nobody came in. Nobody moved anything. But when I looked at the coffee table, the remote was on the wrong side.

I tried to think rationally. Maybe I was moving things and not remembering. Stress, lack of sleep, some kind of dissociative state. I made an appointment with a doctor.

But the footage from work kept getting worse.

I saw myself in a bathroom stall, sitting on the floor. I saw myself in a basement with exposed pipes and concrete walls. I saw myself in a car trunk, curled up, eyes open, not moving.

That clip was dated tomorrow.

Last night I watched myself die.

The feed glitched at 4:52 AM. I was looking at a room I didn't recognize. Tile floor, industrial sink, metal table. I was lying on the table. Not moving. Eyes closed.

Someone walked into frame. I couldn't see their face. They were wearing gloves. They stood over me for a long time, just looking down. Then they picked up my wrist, checked for a pulse.

They let my arm drop and walked out of frame.

The footage ran for another three minutes. Just me on the table. Not breathing. Then it cut back to the normal feed.

The timestamp said it was recorded six hours from now.

I called in sick. Told my supervisor I had food poisoning. I went home and locked every door, checked every window. I'm sitting in my kitchen with all the lights on.

It's 10:47 AM.

In six hours I'm supposed to be dead in a room I've never seen.

But here's what I keep thinking about.

I pulled the footage from every clip I've saved. Went through frame by frame. I was looking for something, anything that would tell me where these recordings were coming from.

In the clip of me sleeping, the one that ran eighteen minutes, there's a moment at the very end. Right before it cuts off. The camera shifts. Just slightly. Like someone adjusted it.

And in the bottom corner of the frame, for maybe half a second, you can see a reflection in the window.

Someone standing in the room. Watching me sleep.

The resolution is too low to see details. But I can see the outline. The shape.

It's me.

I'm the one holding the camera.

I have to go to work tonight. My shift starts at 11 PM. I thought about not going, but if I'm already dead by then, what difference does it make?

And maybe when I get there, I'll finally see where all these feeds are coming from. Maybe I'll find the source.

Or maybe I'll just watch it happen.

I've been checking the monitors from my phone. The company app lets me view feeds remotely. I've been refreshing it every few minutes.

Ten minutes ago, a new clip appeared.

I'm in my kitchen. Right now. Sitting at the table with my laptop.

The camera angle is from behind me, over my right shoulder. I can see the screen. I can see what I'm typing.

I looked around my kitchen. There's nothing behind me but the wall.

But on my phone, I can see myself sitting here. I can see the back of my head. I can see my hands on the keyboard.

The timestamp says it's being recorded right now. Live feed.

I'm going to stand up. I'm going to turn around.

If there's a camera, I'll find it.

If there's not, then I don't know what I'm looking at.

I just stood up and turned around.

There's nothing there.

But on my phone, I can still see myself. Still sitting at the table. Still typing.

We usually go 3-4 days without seeing eachother even in passing due to our jobs. We had a great sex life at first, but a lot of things happened on both our ends/faults where we broke eachothers emotional safety (never cheating). Weve been married for 1 year, living together for 3. Both in our young 20’s. 

I have endometriosis and PTSD. I’m on myfembree (puts you in menopause forced basically - really high estrogen) which took my sex drive down a large bump. I dont get horny on my own anymore. I don’t masturbate unless me and him have sex. I only get horny once a week because I find my husband really attractive, but the emotional intimacy and having long “love eachothers bodies” has gone away.

He said some things that really hurt me about my childhood trauma basically victim blaming/grossed out by it and Ive just shut down since and now feel guilty and wrong and dirty when he touches me most the time and my
Nervous systems a wreck. I disassociate constantly. 

He also became religious recently and became anti abortion / pro deportation which shattered me as well. I did not handle it well and was pretty mean and condescending about it. Most recently he said he’d become an ICE agent if it paid well and I blew up (no screaming but very stern verbiage and tone). He said he doesn’t like how I look at him with seemingly hate when we talk about those political differences. I am working on this and should be more respectful. 

We also moved 7 months ago away from my hometown/family/friends and Ive been depressed since then and much less engaged in our relationship. He also has his own mental health struggles. I’ve hurt him emotionally in the past by oversharing to close friends about our relationship struggles (very personal things) which I have stopped, and by having BPD which was bad in the first part of our relationship and I was emotionally all over the place and would split on him. 

He doesn’t want to do marriage counseling or read couples books but I dont know how else to fix us. We’re both in 1 on 1 counseling. But we have both been pretty unhappy, especially since he’s changed more and had beliefs about my trauma which in-turn made me react very poorly and be more distant. I’ve been snappy and short with him which I’m working on. 

We have been having financial hardships and do dates like walks / cup of coffee / board games / gym. I love him so much still but I feel both of us are struggling to be happy together. I want to go on more dates so badly but the funds aren’t there and we’re an hour drive away from everything. 

I just miss the emotional connection, emotion safety and intimacy and I know he does too. I just feel we are moving down different life paths. We’re still trying to plan for our next move and future together but emotionally it feels empty. I don’t want a divorce, I want my husband back. ",1,1765726429.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

I just upgraded from a DF54 to the Life X (paired with a Profitec Go), expecting a massive improvement. Instead, it's been a nightmare. I've had it two days with zero successful runs and lots of frustration and wasted beans. I've been doing the espresso thing for a while and do tons of research, reading, video watching, etc and this has been ridiculous. My DF54 was a mess to use, static everywhere, but easy to dial in. 

Here r the issues:
It's nearly impossible to dial-In! Setting from 10-0 is the full range and they say 2-0 is the espresso range so basically tiny! 1.5 was a massive gusher. Going slightly finer to 1.2  or 1.3 results in the chute completely clogging. Oddly it only clogs at the end like it doesn't have what it takes to get the last bit out. I get maybe 15g of 18g and the rest is stuck. The motor and burrs keep spinning, but the coffee impacts in the internal opening to the chute and stops flowing with a few beans rattling around inside. Even using RDT and Hot Start, I get coffee stuck in the exit path. Brushing it out shows it's inside not directly in the chute so that doesn't unclog it. Just for fun I tried 2.5 which didn't clog it but I basically filled a cup in 10 seconds with brown water. Ha! 

Bellows Failure: The clog is so tight that the bellows get stuck down and won't rebound and the clog remains. FYI the clog isn't wet or oily, it's LaVazza Gran Crema so should be 100% easy for any grinder. I often have to grind more beans at a coarse setting just to force the plug out. It sort of uncorks and it all comes out at once.

I also tried Happy Mug Bigfoot, another super easy to grind bean with same poor results.

My DF54 handled these effortlessly.

It is a moment of comfort, focus, and routine that sets the tone for the rest of your day. While most people spend time choosing the right coffee beans or brewing method, the coffee mug itself is often overlooked. However, the mug you use can significantly influence your drinking experience, from temperature retention to taste perception and even emotional satisfaction.

Choosing the perfect coffee mug is not just about looks. It involves understanding materials, size, shape, comfort, and how your daily habits align with these features. This guide will walk you through every important factor so you can confidently select a coffee mug that truly enhances your daily brew.

# Why the Right Coffee Mug Matters

At first glance, a [coffee mug](https://www.truegether.com/category/collectibles) may seem like a simple container. However, the right mug improves comfort, maintains the ideal temperature, and makes your coffee routine more enjoyable. On the other hand, the wrong mug can cool your drink too quickly, feel awkward in your hand, or even subtly affect the flavor.

Moreover, since coffee is often consumed daily, small inconveniences add up over time. A mug that fits your lifestyle and preferences makes each sip more satisfying and turns a routine habit into a small pleasure.

# Understanding Your Coffee Drinking Habits

Before choosing a coffee mug, it is important to understand how and when you drink coffee. This clarity helps narrow down your options and prevents unnecessary purchases.

If you enjoy slow mornings at home, you may prefer a larger, heavier mug that stays warm longer. If you drink coffee while commuting or working, a lighter and more portable mug might be better. Additionally, consider how many cups you drink per day and whether you prefer refills or one large serving.

Your habits are the foundation for choosing the right mug, so start there.

# Choosing the Right Material

The material of a coffee mug plays a major role in heat retention, taste, durability, and overall feel. Each material has its own advantages and limitations.

Ceramic mugs are one of the most popular choices for daily use. They retain heat well, do not alter the taste of coffee, and come in endless designs. Ceramic is ideal for home and office use, especially if you enjoy sipping coffee slowly.

Porcelain mugs are a refined version of ceramic. They are lighter, smoother, and often more elegant. While they retain heat slightly less than thick ceramic, they offer a premium feel that many people enjoy during relaxed coffee moments.

Glass mugs allow you to see the color and texture of your coffee, which adds a visual element to the experience. However, glass tends to lose heat faster unless it is double-walled. These mugs are best for those who drink coffee quickly or enjoy specialty drinks.

Stainless steel mugs excel at heat retention and durability. They are perfect for travel or long work hours. However, they can sometimes affect the taste of coffee and may not offer the same cozy feel as ceramic or porcelain.

Plastic mugs are lightweight and affordable, but they often compromise on heat retention and taste. They are better suited for casual or outdoor use rather than daily coffee rituals.

# Selecting the Right Mug Size

Mug size is another crucial factor that directly affects your daily brew experience. The ideal size depends on how much coffee you drink at once.

Small mugs, typically holding 150 to 250 ml, are ideal for espresso or strong coffee. They encourage mindful sipping and help maintain temperature.

Medium-sized mugs, around 300 to 350 ml, are the most common choice. They balance portion size and heat retention, making them suitable for most coffee drinkers.

Large mugs, ranging from 400 ml and above, are perfect for those who prefer fewer refills. However, larger mugs may cool down faster unless they are well insulated.

Choosing the right size ensures your coffee stays enjoyable from the first sip to the last.

# Shape and Its Impact on Coffee Experience

The shape of a coffee mug influences both aroma and taste. While this may seem subtle, it can make a noticeable difference.

Wide-mouth mugs allow aromas to escape easily, enhancing the sensory experience. They are great for those who enjoy the smell of coffee as much as the taste.

Narrow-mouth mugs retain heat longer and concentrate aromas, making them ideal for stronger brews. They also reduce spillage, which is useful for busy mornings.

The shape of the base also matters. A stable, wide base prevents tipping and adds a sense of security, especially on work desks.

# Handle Comfort and Grip

A coffee mug should feel comfortable in your hand. The handle plays a major role in this.

Look for a handle that allows at least two fingers to fit comfortably. This provides better grip and reduces strain. Handles that are too small or awkwardly shaped can make the mug difficult to hold, especially when hot.

Additionally, consider the angle of the handle. A well-positioned handle keeps your wrist relaxed and balanced. This is particularly important if you drink coffee frequently throughout the day.

# Weight and Balance

The weight of a coffee mug affects comfort and usability. Heavier mugs feel sturdy and luxurious, but they may not be ideal for long periods of holding. Lighter mugs are easier to handle but may feel less substantial.

Balance is just as important as weight. A well-balanced mug feels stable whether it is full or empty. Poor balance can cause spills and discomfort over time.

Think about how you usually hold your mug and choose one that feels natural and effortless.

# Heat Retention and Insulation

One of the main purposes of a coffee mug is to keep your drink warm. Heat retention varies based on material, thickness, and design.

Thicker ceramic and porcelain mugs retain heat better than thin ones. Double-walled glass mugs provide insulation while maintaining a sleek look. Stainless steel mugs with insulation offer the longest heat retention.

If you enjoy sipping coffee over an extended period, prioritize insulation. If you drink quickly, heat retention may be less critical.

# Microwave and Dishwasher Safety

Convenience is a key factor in daily use. A microwave-safe mug allows you to reheat coffee without transferring it to another container. Dishwasher-safe mugs save time and effort when cleaning.

Most ceramic and porcelain mugs are microwave and dishwasher safe, but always check manufacturer guidelines. Some decorative finishes or metallic accents may limit usability.

Choosing a mug that fits seamlessly into your routine adds to long-term satisfaction.

# Durability and Longevity

A coffee mug used daily should be durable. Chips, cracks, and fading designs can reduce both function and enjoyment.

High-quality ceramic and porcelain mugs offer good durability when handled properly. Stainless steel mugs are nearly indestructible and ideal for active lifestyles.

Investing in a durable mug may cost slightly more upfront, but it saves money and frustration over time.

# Aesthetic Appeal and Personal Style

Your coffee mug is often a reflection of your personality. Whether you prefer minimalist designs, bold colors, or quirky quotes, aesthetics matter.

A mug that aligns with your style makes your coffee ritual more enjoyable. It can also enhance your workspace or kitchen décor.

While appearance should not outweigh functionality, choosing a mug you genuinely like adds emotional value to your daily routine.

# Matching the Mug to Your Coffee Type

Different coffee styles pair better with certain mug designs.

Espresso and strong brews work well in smaller, thicker mugs that retain heat. Lattes and cappuccinos benefit from wider mugs that accommodate foam. Black coffee drinkers may prefer medium-sized mugs that balance aroma and heat retention.

Matching the mug to your preferred coffee type enhances the overall experience.

**Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Choices**

Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in everyday choices. Reusable coffee mugs reduce waste from disposable cups.

Ceramic, glass, and stainless steel mugs are more eco-friendly than plastic. Additionally, choosing a durable mug that lasts for years minimizes environmental impact.

If sustainability matters to you, consider how the mug is made and how long it is likely to last.

**Budget Considerations**

Coffee mugs are available at every price point. While it may be tempting to choose the cheapest option, consider long-term value.

A well-made mug that lasts for years is often a better investment than repeatedly replacing low-quality ones. Balance your budget with quality, comfort, and usability. You can find affordable yet beautiful mugs from TrueGether, also considered the best [eBay alternative](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html).

**Owning More Than One Mug**

While finding the perfect coffee mug is important, owning a small variety can be practical. Different mugs suit different situations, such as home, office, or travel.

Having options allows flexibility without compromising comfort or experience.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a Coffee Mug

Many people choose mugs based solely on appearance, ignoring comfort and practicality. Others buy oversized mugs that cool coffee too quickly or choose materials that affect taste.

Avoid these mistakes by prioritizing function first and style second. Test how a mug feels in your hand whenever possible.

# How the Right Coffee Mug Enhances Your Daily Routine

The right coffee mug supports mindfulness and consistency. It becomes part of your routine, signaling moments of focus, relaxation, or creativity.

Over time, this familiarity adds comfort and stability to your day. Small details like this can have a surprisingly positive impact on daily life.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing the perfect coffee mug for your daily brew is a personal decision that goes beyond simple aesthetics. It involves understanding your habits, preferences, and lifestyle.

By considering material, size, shape, comfort, and durability, you can select a mug that truly enhances your coffee experience. The right mug keeps your coffee at the ideal temperature, feels good in your hand, and fits seamlessly into your routine.

Ultimately, the perfect coffee mug turns an ordinary habit into a comforting ritual. When chosen thoughtfully, it becomes more than just a mug. It becomes part of your day, every single morning.

[**Am I overreacting because I told my niece I don't want to take her best friend with us anymore after she kept telling me I was a victim and my husband was a creep?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pijg2x/am_i_overreacting_because_i_told_my_niece_i_dont/)

Recently, I (34f) took my niece and her best friend out for lunch and Christmas shopping. They were talking about boys they liked and niece's friend asked how I met my husband (40m). I told her that I basically knew him my whole life, and she immediately made a disgusted face and yelled rather loudly, ""Ew! That is so gross! You don't even realized you were a victim, do you? You married your groomer"" I was really bothered by it, and by my niece's silence, but I ignored her and told them to just keep shopping. People assume that because we have a 6 year age gap, that we knew each other most of our lives, and that we started dating when I was 20, that I was ""groomed"", they don't let me explain how it happened in the first place.

After I dropped off niece's friend, I told her that I didn't want to do anymore outings with that friend anymore. She's 15, so she unsurpringly lost her cool, refusing to admit that her friend stepped over a line by talking to me how she did. Am I overreacting? I didn't say anything personal about the girl, and I wasn't yelling. I just said, ""Look, I don't want to take you and [friend's name] out anymore. You can bring friends with, but I don't want to be around her.""

For anyone interested in deciding whether the niece's friend was right:

My husband and I did grow up together. He's been my older brother's best friend since they were 8 (so we probably met when I was 2 or 3). He lives 2 blocks over, so he was always around. My brother always included me when his friends came over, so whether it was board games or video games, I was always there. As we all got older, they would let me go with them to the movies, or to skate parks, or moat places they went - neither had a problem with me being around.

My husband and I didn't hang out on our own though - not anymore than a few minutes of idle chatting if he came by and my brother wasn't there anyway. We never had each other's phone numbers, and we didn't seek out one another. I had a little crush on him most of my life, but it was just a ""Man, he is so cute"" kind of crush, not a ""How do I make him notice me more"" crush. We never thought anything about the other dating (we both admit now that some of our exes were real doozies, but we weren't close enough friends to butt in that way). We weren't best friends, but both of us referred to the other as a friend.

So, when I went away to college, we weren't in contact unless I called my brother and they were hanging out together. When I drove home for winter break my first year, my car broke down. It wasn't budging. I was on a poorly lit, back road, in the middle of nowhere, and I panicked. I called my brother and asked if he knew what his friend was doing right then (he worked on cars a lot and had a friend with a tow truck that would let him use it). Turned out that they were hanging out that night, so my future husband asked where I was and said ""No problem, I'll get you"".

An hour and a half later he showed up as promised. He told me to get in the truck to warm up and that he brought me a blanket and a thermos of coffee. He got my car on the truck and hopped in, making sure that I was doing okay and asking if I needed to stop anywhere before we got home. Then he asked why I didn't call him in the first place. I reminded him that we never needed to exchange numbers before and he said, ""Well, let's fix that now.""

Over the next two years, we would occasionally text each other. It started out with just stupid video game or movie memes that made us laugh, but slowly grew to us texting once or twice a week about work, classes, stuff we were doing. We were casually dating other people here and there, but it was never a problem for either of us - after all, we weren't in a relationship, and even when I was home, we still weren't spending time together alone.

During my third year of school, I was home for Christmas again and my now-husband asked if I wanted to go to a bar that a friend of his was playing [in a band] at. My brother was a new dad and not going. I asked if it was going to be a problem that I was only 20, but he said that the drummer's little sister was still in high school and she would sometimes go watch him play, so just don't try to order drinks.

All during my winter break, we spent a lot of time together (it felt like a lot because we weren't used to it being just the two of us). My brother was busy with my niece and my sister in law, and we had free time. The fifth time we hung out over my 3.5 week break was the last before I left. Before we went our separate ways, he asked me if it was okay if he kissed me. I was surprised, but I enthusiastically said yes. The rest is history.

So in addition to ""Am I overreacting to a 14/15 year old girl publicly yelling that I was groomed?"" I can also ask, ""Does this honestly sound like I was groomed?""

# **Final Update - 2 days later**

^(December 11, 2025)

So, my niece AND her friend saw my post, because it blew up, even though I just made a throwaway account for the question. This sped up when I planned to talk to the girls about it all. As several of you pointed out, I talk too much, so let me keep it brief, but touch on a few points.

Yes, the kid got in my head. It wasn't a brief, passing comment, she kept pushing it for a few minutes, which was why I redirected. I was also just taken so aback by it, because it was something I never would have done as a kid. I should have come up with a better way to handle it, but I was trying to keep the night light-hearted.

I am not my niece's guardian. I was not trying to block any part of their friendship, only whether I would let her tag along on our trips together around town - ONLY with me.

Niece apologized. She was kind of in shock too, and she didn't know what to say.

Niece's friend sent her a message to forward to me, apologizing as well. As some mentioned, she had a hard time imagining someone my husband's age (she thought he was at least 10 years older than me) seeing herself at her age and still growing up to be attracted to them.

Everything is fine now, I told my niece that her friend can still hang out when I take her out, but that she needed to be more respectful to me, and to not jump to conclusions.

And, my husband did ask my brother if it was okay to make a move on me, but neither of them could remember when it was exactly. 🤷‍♀️

Now, I'm abandoning this throwaway since everyone knows about it anyway.

1pmgpss,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmgpss/the_question_every_accent_coaching_student_asks/,The question every accent coaching student asks around week three (and why you're probably tracking the wrong things),"**The question every accent coaching student asks around week three (and why you're probably tracking the wrong things)**

I work with non-native professionals doing accent coaching, and around week three, I hear the same frustrated question: ""Am I actually getting better, or does it just feel that way?""

It's a fair question. Pronunciation improvement feels maddeningly gradual when you're in the thick of it.

Here's the problem nobody talks about upfront.

**The tracking problem:**

You might nail the American 'R' sound in Monday's practice session, completely butcher it on Wednesday's client call, and then wonder if you've made any progress at all.

Without concrete tracking, you're flying blind—relying on gut feeling instead of hard data to guide your practice.

I see this constantly. People record themselves regularly (which is good), but they don't know what to actually measure. They listen back and think ""I sound better, I think?"" or ""I still sound terrible"" depending on their mood that day.

These subjective measures are almost useless because they shift based on your energy level, whether you've had coffee, and how confident you're feeling that particular morning.

**Why ""practice more"" advice fails:**

The typical advice you'll find online? ""Record yourself regularly and compare.""

Okay, sure. But compare *what* exactly? Your overall vibe? How confident you sound?

The problem isn't that people aren't recording themselves. It's that they're not tracking specific, measurable elements that actually indicate pronunciation improvement.

Think of it like fitness. You wouldn't just say ""I want to get in shape"" and then hope for the best. You'd track specific metrics: weight lifted, miles run, body fat percentage.

The same principle applies to accent work. You need concrete data points that show whether the work you're putting in is actually moving the needle.

**What to actually track (the metrics that matter):**

Not all metrics are created equal. Some are vanity metrics—they sound impressive but don't correlate with functional improvement. Others are actionable metrics that directly reflect your ability to communicate clearly in real-world situations.

**Pronunciation accuracy: Getting the sounds right**

This is the foundation. If you're consistently mispronouncing key sounds, all the fluency and intonation work in the world won't help you be understood.

What to track:

* **Phoneme accuracy rate:** In a 100-word passage, how many individual sounds do you pronounce correctly? Target: 95%+ for clear communication.
* **Problem sound consistency:** Pick your 3-5 most challenging sounds (like the American 'R', 'TH', or vowel distinctions). Track your accuracy on these specific sounds in isolation and in connected speech.
* **Improvement velocity:** Are you correcting 10% more sounds correctly each week, or has progress flatlined?

How to measure it: Record yourself reading a standard passage (like a paragraph from a news article). Listen back and mark every mispronounced sound. Calculate your accuracy percentage. Do this weekly.

Key insight: Improvement isn't linear. You might jump from 70% to 85% accuracy in two weeks, then plateau at 85% for a month while your brain consolidates the new patterns. That plateau isn't failure—it's necessary integration time.

**Fluency and flow: Sounding natural, not rehearsed**

Native-like fluency isn't about speaking fast. It's about maintaining a smooth, natural rhythm without awkward pauses, false starts, or excessive hesitation.

What to track:

* **Hesitation frequency:** Count pauses longer than 1 second in a one-minute speech sample. Native speakers average 2-4 pauses per minute; learners often have 10+.
* **Filler word usage:** Track ""um,"" ""uh,"" ""like,"" ""you know"" per 100 words. These often spike when you're mentally translating or searching for pronunciation.
* **Speech rate consistency:** Measure words per minute. You're not aiming for fast—you're aiming for *steady*. Inconsistent pacing (fast then slow then fast again) signals cognitive overload.

How to measure it: Set a timer for 60 seconds and speak spontaneously on a random topic. Record it. Count pauses, fillers, and total words. Repeat this weekly with different topics to avoid memorization effects.

**Intonation patterns: The melody that signals meaning**

English intonation does serious heavy lifting. Rising pitch signals questions, falling pitch signals certainty, and flat monotone signals confusion or disengagement.

Get this wrong and you sound uncertain—even when you know exactly what you're saying.

What to track:

* **Pitch pattern accuracy:** In yes/no questions, does your pitch rise at the end? In statements, does it fall?
* **Stress pattern consistency:** Are you emphasizing the correct syllables in multi-syllable words? (RE-cord vs. re-CORD?)
* **Emotional range:** Can you vary your intonation to sound enthusiastic, serious, or questioning as needed?

How to measure it: Record yourself asking 5 questions and making 5 statements. Listen back. Does each question have rising intonation? Do statements fall? Mark correct/incorrect. Aim for 90%+ consistency.

**Real-world intelligibility: The ultimate metric**

Here's the metric that actually matters in professional settings: Can people understand you without effort?

What to track:

* **Intelligibility score:** Have 3-5 colleagues rate how well they understand you on a scale of 1-5. Track the average over time.
* **Repetition requests:** How often do people ask ""Can you repeat that?"" or ""Sorry, what?"" Track this weekly.
* **Meeting contribution frequency:** Are you speaking up more in meetings, or still censoring yourself because you're worried about pronunciation?

How to measure it: Once a month, ask 3-5 colleagues: ""On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to understand me in today's meeting?"" Keep it light and casual. You're gathering data on real-world intelligibility.

**Setting milestones that actually drive progress:**

Generic goals like ""improve my accent"" are motivation killers. You'll never feel like you're making progress because the target is fuzzy.

Instead, you need concrete, time-bound milestones that turn abstract improvement into wins you can celebrate.

**Phase 1: Foundation building (Weeks 1-4)**

Milestone 1: Master your top 5 problem sounds in isolation

* Specific: Achieve 90%+ accuracy on /θ/ (think), /ð/ (this), /r/ (red), /v/ (very), /w/ (water) in 50-word drills
* Measurable: Record and score yourself weekly
* Time-bound: End of week 4

Milestone 2: Reduce hesitation pauses by 30%

* Baseline: Record a 1-minute spontaneous speech in week 1, count pauses
* Target: Reduce that count by 30% by week 4
* Why it matters: Fewer pauses = more confident delivery, even if pronunciation isn't perfect yet

**Phase 2: Integration and application (Weeks 5-8)**

Milestone 3: Maintain 85%+ pronunciation accuracy in connected speech

* Test: Read a 200-word passage aloud weekly. Track mispronunciations.
* Target: Drop from 20-30 errors to under 15 by week 8
* Application: This tests whether isolated sound practice transfers to real speaking

Milestone 4: Deliver a 3-minute prepared presentation with consistent intonation

* Measure: Record yourself. Count intonation errors (rising when should fall, monotone delivery, stress on wrong syllables)
* Target: Under 5 errors in a 3-minute talk
* Real-world relevance: This mirrors actual professional scenarios

**Phase 3: Mastery and maintenance (Months 3+)**

Milestone 5: Handle spontaneous conversation with 95%+ intelligibility

* Test: Have 3 native speakers rate your clarity in 5-minute unscripted conversations
* Target: Average score of 4.5/5 or higher
* Why this matters: This is the ultimate real-world test—can people understand you without effort in unpredictable situations?

Pro tip: Write each milestone on a simple checklist or spreadsheet. Checking off completed targets triggers a motivation boost that keeps you practicing when progress feels slow.

**The simple recording system that actually works:**

Let's be honest: if your tracking system requires 30 minutes of admin work after every practice session, you're not going to stick with it.

The best tracking system is the one you'll actually use consistently.

**Daily quick checks (5 minutes):**

* Record yourself reading one standard paragraph
* Focus on your current problem sounds
* Listen back once—don't obsess
* Note 1-2 observations in a simple log

**Weekly deep dives (15 minutes):**

* Record a 1-minute spontaneous speech on a work-related topic
* Record yourself reading a 200-word passage
* Score your pronunciation accuracy, count hesitations, measure words per minute
* Compare to last week's recording

**Monthly progress reviews (30 minutes):**

* Listen to your week 1 recording and your most recent recording back-to-back
* Celebrate improvements (even small ones)
* Identify persistent problem areas for next month's focus

Labeling system that works: Use this format: `YYYY-MM-DD_Type_Focus`

Examples:

* `2025-12-15_Spontaneous_ClientPitch`
* `2025-12-15_Passage_RSound`
* `2025-12-22_Spontaneous_TeamMeeting`

This format lets you sort chronologically and quickly find specific practice types when comparing progress.

**Leveraging coach feedback (the external validation you need):**

Self-assessment has a fatal flaw: you can't hear your own mistakes accurately. Your brain automatically ""corrects"" what you hear to match what you *think* you said.

That's why external feedback is non-negotiable for accurate progress tracking.

**What to ask your coach:**

* ""Can I record our sessions for review?""
* ""Will you send me session notes highlighting my top 3 focus areas?""
* ""Can we do a formal assessment every 4-6 weeks to track measurable progress?""

**What to request:**

Biweekly progress reviews (15 minutes):

* Specific strengths you've developed
* Top 3 persistent challenges
* Recommended focus for next two weeks

Monthly written assessments (shared via email):

* Quantified improvement (e.g., ""pronunciation accuracy increased from 78% to 86%"")
* Comparison to initial baseline
* Adjusted goals for next month

These structured reviews give you concrete data points to track over time and help you see progress that feels invisible day-to-day.

**Simple tracking template you can start today:**

Here's a basic weekly tracking table you can set up in 5 minutes:

|Week|Pronunciation Accuracy|Hesitations (per min)|Speech Rate (WPM)|Intelligibility (1-5)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|75%|8|95|3.2|
|2|78%|7|100|3.5|
|3|82%|6|105|3.8|
|4|85%|4|110|4.2|

What this table reveals:

* Pronunciation accuracy climbing steadily (+10% over 4 weeks)
* Hesitations cut in half (cognitive load decreasing)
* Speech rate increasing naturally as confidence builds
* Intelligibility improving—people understand you better

Once you have 4-6 weeks of data, create simple charts in Google Sheets. Line graphs showing your trajectory are incredibly motivating when improvement feels slow.

**When to adjust your coaching plan based on data:**

This is where tracking transforms from busywork into strategic advantage.

**When to shift your focus:**

If pronunciation accuracy tops 90% consistently for 2+ weeks:

* You've mastered foundational sounds
* Time to shift focus to connected speech, rhythm, and intonation
* Reduce time on isolated phoneme drills
* Increase time on conversation practice and real-world scenarios

If hesitation frequency drops below 3 per minute:

* Your cognitive load has decreased significantly
* You're no longer mentally translating or searching for words
* Start working on more advanced elements like emotion, emphasis, and style

If intelligibility scores plateau despite improving other metrics:

* The issue might not be pronunciation—it could be volume, pacing, or confidence
* Consider adding public speaking or presentation skills work

**When to adjust coaching frequency:**

Increase session frequency when:

* You've plateaued for 3+ weeks despite consistent practice
* Your intelligibility scores aren't improving even though pronunciation metrics are
* You have a specific high-stakes event coming up

Decrease session frequency when:

* You're making steady progress (5-10% monthly improvement)
* Your problem sounds are becoming automatic in spontaneous speech
* You're consistently hitting 90%+ on all core metrics

The data tells you exactly where to focus your limited time and money for maximum impact.

**The practical takeaway:**

You don't need to implement every system all at once. Start small and build momentum.

Week 1 action steps:

1. Record yourself reading a 100-word paragraph
2. Count mispronunciations and calculate accuracy percentage
3. Create a simple tracking spreadsheet with 3 columns: Date, Accuracy %, Notes
4. Set your first milestone: ""Improve accuracy by 5% in 2 weeks""

Week 2 action steps:

1. Record the same paragraph again
2. Calculate new accuracy percentage and log it
3. Add one more metric: hesitation count in 60-second spontaneous speech
4. Share your progress with your coach or a colleague for external validation

Month 1 action steps:

1. Compare week 1 and week 4 recordings side by side
2. Create a simple line graph showing your 4-week accuracy trend
3. Set your next 2-month milestones based on what the data reveals
4. Adjust your practice focus to target your most stubborn challenges

**What to ignore:**

The idea that you need fancy software or complex systems. A simple spreadsheet updated weekly beats a sophisticated system you abandon after two weeks.

Also ignore the temptation to track everything perfectly. One metric tracked consistently for 8 weeks will give you more actionable insight than trying to track ten metrics for two weeks before giving up.

**The uncomfortable truth:**

Progress is happening even when you can't feel it. Your brain is rewiring pronunciation patterns at a neurological level, and that work is invisible—until you measure it.

That's why tracking isn't optional. It's the difference between trusting your gut (which will lie to you) and trusting your data (which won't).

When you can point to concrete evidence that you've reduced hesitations by 50%, improved pronunciation accuracy by 15%, and increased intelligibility ratings from 3 to 4.5—that proof becomes rocket fuel for your motivation.

Small, consistent improvements compound into massive gains over months. But only if you measure them.

1pmgopb,https://i.redd.it/25edirz1u67g1.jpeg,Dear Diary: Day 3,"11.12.2025

Let’s be honest: today was rough, and the headache that came with it wasn’t helping.
But I think this is one of those days that feels like the labor pains of something better being born. I now have three fully revised systems in front of me: the health system, the mental resilience system, and a brand-new experience and skill-acquisition system.
Calling it a “level system” would be inaccurate, because I think I may have accidentally removed the entire concept of leveling from the game.
Sometimes you just flip the table and go radical. I do that a lot.

But none of that was the hard part.

Rewriting these mechanics and finishing the terminology dictionary ate half my day, yes—but the real weight was the realization that, after all this time, I finally know how to present the voice of the scribe who won’t shut up in my head.

As I write this, Affinity is open on my screen; the MasterPage is up. A page the color of ivory—lightly textured, like a traveler’s journal, almost like Tomoe River paper, but rougher. Not the stiff, mass-pressed kind.
More like the kind wrapped in red, tanned hide—a wanderer’s notebook from the 19th-century Orient, made long before machines decided paper should be perfect.
Something between Arthur Morgan’s journal and Leonardo da Vinci’s sketchbooks, but darker, dusted with ash from the Grey Road.

I’m not going for those cliché burnt-edge parchment PDFs you see everywhere.
This journal belongs to someone who took care of it—who protected it.
Someone who writes with a single color of ink because that’s all the world allows.
Someone who sketches in charcoal.
Someone whose pages have stains of tea… or ink… or blood, depending on the night.

That’s the voice I’m bringing forward.
That’s how your notes—from my head, via this fictional scribe—will finally live on the page.

Before I wrap up, I should mention something simple and strangely uplifting: I actually went outside today. Met a friend. Had coffee. Then tea—six or seven glasses, I think—and the conversation drifted into the kind of art philosophy talk that keeps you awake for days.

Gonca and I ended up circling around this idea:
that music and story together can either hold meaning or lead emotion;
that entertainment is undeniably part of art;
but that somewhere deeper, the core of art is sorrow, tragedy, and the ache that makes us human.
Maybe the most emotional works really are the most valuable ones.

I’m ending tonight not with a song, but with something I treasure deeply:

I’ve been meditating for about three years now, mostly inconsistently if I’m being honest but something happened last month that I can’t quite explain and I’m wondering if others have experienced anything similar.
I was sitting in my usual spot, this old prayer chair my grandmother left me that I keep by the window and about fifteen minutes in, the quality of silence just changed. It wasn’t that thoughts stopped or that I achieved some blissful state. It was more like the space between thoughts became more tangible, almost textured, I don't know if that's the right word.
The best way I can describe it: you know how you can feel the difference between an empty room and one with people in it, even with your eyes closed? It felt like that, except the “emptiness” itself had presence. Not threatening or comforting necessarily, just there. Alive somehow.
Since then, I’ve noticed this quality appearing randomly throughout my day; waiting for coffee to brew, sitting in traffic, even scrolling through random product listings on alibaba or amazon at 2am when I can’t sleep. It’s like my perception cracked open slightly and now I can’t unsee it.
I’m not looking for explanations necessarily, more wondering if this resonates with anyone. Did your relationship with silence or emptiness shift suddenly? How did you integrate it into daily life?

1. The nature of engagement:

I would argue that most posts here are created with the intent to ""prove a point"" and tear down someone else's ideas, rather than with a high degree of intellectual humility.

I see a large amount of arguing and often discourse, but I rarely see anybody ""changing their mind"" in the threads.

2. The inherent dehumanization of this form of discourse:

I think that these conversations would become different from what they currently are if they were to take place face-to-face over coffee. The amount of hostility would decrease, and the openness in the discourse would as well. I think this is because when we are just commenting on screens to other people, we don't see, and most importantly, don't know, that the nature of the discourse becomes dehumanized.

1pmgnrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasyRecipesHub/comments/1pmgnrm/what_percent_of_gen_z_cant_cook/,What Percent Of Gen Z Can't Cook?,"# The percentage of Gen Z who can't cook: Exploring the reasons and implications

In today's fast-paced world, the ability to cook is increasingly becoming a skill that many young people are lacking. Recent studies indicate that a significant percentage of Generation Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, struggle to cook even the simplest meals. Estimates suggest that around 40% of this demographic can't cook basic dishes. This statistic raises several questions about the reasons behind this trend and its implications for health, independence, and lifestyle.

Understanding why many Gen Z individuals find themselves in this situation involves looking at various factors that impact their daily lives. One key reason is the changing landscape of food accessibility and preparation. With the rise of food delivery services, it has become much easier to order meals rather than prepare them at home. Services like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and others cater to a generation that values convenience, often at the expense of learning essential cooking skills.

Another significant factor is the impact of technology. Technology has transformed almost every aspect of life, including how we eat. With an abundance of cooking videos and tutorials available online, many might assume that learning to cook would be easy. However, while these resources are undoubtedly helpful, they can also make cooking seem more daunting. This can lead to what some may describe as “paralysis by analysis,” where individuals feel overwhelmed by the vast information available and ultimately do not engage in cooking at all.

Additionally, time management plays a crucial role. Many in Gen Z balance school, work, and social commitments, leaving little time or energy for cooking. Fast-paced lifestyles often lead to choices that favor quick snacks or takeout rather than putting in the effort to cook. This not only affects their culinary skills but can also have a lasting impact on their health.

Health implications of this trend are concerning. Processed foods and takeout meals often contain excessive sodium, unhealthy fats, and sugars. Without basic cooking skills, Gen Z may struggle to create balanced meals that are vital for sustaining long-term health. Understanding nutritional values and cooking methods is essential for fostering better eating habits, which many in this generation are missing out on. Over time, this can contribute to diet-related health issues such as obesity and diabetes.

The lack of cooking skills also impacts personal independence. Knowing how to prepare one’s meals is a foundational life skill that fosters self-sufficiency. Without the ability to cook, young adults might find themselves reliant on others or continue to spend money on takeout, which can strain budgets. Learning to cook is not just about making meals; it's a rite of passage into adulthood that encourages responsibility and resourcefulness.

Many educators and parents recognize the importance of these skills and are finding innovative ways to integrate cooking into daily life. Schools are beginning to revamp home economics classes, focusing on practical cooking skills and nutrition education. In the home, parents can encourage children to participate in meal preparation, sparking interest in cooking while instilling essential skills.

For those who want to learn, there is hope. Here are a few strategies that can help improve cooking skills:

* **Start Simple:** Choose easy recipes that require minimal ingredients and steps.
* **Engage with Cooking Shows:** Watching cooking shows or YouTube channels can provide inspiration and a guide to different techniques.
* **Meal Preparation:** Plan meals ahead of time to make the cooking process less daunting and more organized.
* **Join Cooking Classes:** Look for local or online classes that cater specifically to beginners.

The percentage of Generation Z who can’t cook reflects a complex intersection of modern lifestyle choices, technological influences, and changing societal norms. While it’s evident that many young people face challenges in the kitchen, it’s also clear that with the right encouragement, resources, and strategies, they can develop these crucial skills. As more and more people recognize the importance of cooking, it may be possible to reverse the trend and empower Gen Z to embrace the joys of cooking for themselves.

# The impact of technology on Gen Z cooking skills and food choices

In today's fast-paced world, the impact of technology on cooking skills and food choices for Gen Z is significant. This generation, born roughly between the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2010s, has unique influences guiding their kitchen practices. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z has grown up in a digital landscape where technology is omnipresent. This technological familiarity affects their cooking abilities, interest in food, and decision-making processes regarding what to eat.

One major factor is the rise of cooking apps and online tutorials. With platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, Gen Z has access to an abundance of cooking content at their fingertips. You can learn everything from making a simple dish to mastering sophisticated culinary techniques in minutes. These resources tend to be engaging and visually appealing, attracting younger audiences who prefer quick, entertaining content over lengthy recipes. This easy access has led many to wonder: what percent of Gen Z can't cook? Studies show that a notable percentage of this generation finds it difficult to prepare meals from scratch, largely due to this reliance on technology.

Here are some key influences of technology on Gen Z's cooking skills:

* **Social Media Engagement:** Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok allow users to share their cooking experiences. This creates an environment where cooking challenges and trends go viral, encouraging Gen Z to experiment with food.
* **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Video tutorials provide a visual understanding of how to cook, making it easier to grasp cooking techniques. Many Gen Z individuals feel more comfortable learning through videos than traditional cookbooks.
* **Recipe Apps:** Apps like Yummly and Paprika offer tailored meal suggestions, grocery lists, and calorie counts. Gen Z uses these tools to make informed decisions about their meals.

While technology has made cooking more accessible, it also raises concerns about basic cooking skills. According to recent surveys, around 60% of Gen Z reports feeling unsure about cooking a full meal. Instead of focusing solely on cooking from scratch, many prefer convenience foods or take-out options. The rise of meal kit services further reinforces this pattern, providing pre-measured ingredients that take the guesswork out of cooking. However, such services can prevent the development of essential cooking skills.

Food choices are also deeply influenced by technology. Social media trends, for example, can frequently dictate what Gen Z eats. Viral food trends, such as ""cloud bread"" or ""whipped coffee,"" often catch the eye, prompting young people to experiment in the kitchen. This engagement can sometimes lead to a more adventurous palate, as they are eager to try out new food experiences. Yet, it might also mean that traditional dishes and nutritional cooking are overlooked.

Furthermore, many Gen Z individuals prioritize health and sustainability. With the internet full of resources about nutrition and environmental impact, they tend to favor plant-based diets and locally sourced ingredients. This shift in priority highlights that while cooking skills may be lacking, knowledge about healthy eating is often robust among this generation.

Technology has also affected how Gen Z interacts with food delivery services. Apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash have made it easier than ever to order meals with just a few taps. Many Gen Z members opt for these services instead of cooking at home, which can lead to a decrease in kitchen experimentation. Interestingly, the ease of ordering food can detract from the feeling of accomplishment that comes from cooking your own meals, potentially affecting overall life satisfaction.

Ultimately, while the digital age has transformed cooking for Gen Z, it has also led to a complex relationship with food. Some may view the lack of cooking skills as a disadvantage, but it is essential to recognize the creative avenues that technology has opened. The skills that this generation does possess may be more aligned with modern food trends, aesthetics, and time-saving methods.

Technology both facilitates new cooking techniques and complicates traditional skills for Gen Z. As they grow and adapt to these changes, finding a balance between convenience and basic culinary skills will be crucial. Understanding the impact of technology on food choices and cooking practices is vital to fostering a generation that appreciates cooking as an essential life skill.

# Conclusion

As we delve into the percentage of Gen Z who can't cook, it's clear that the numbers are significant. Recent studies indicate that a large portion of this generation lacks basic cooking skills. This trend is influenced by various factors, including time constraints, the fast-paced lifestyle many lead, and the convenience of food delivery services. The quick and easy access to prepared meals may discourage young individuals from stepping into the kitchen, leading to a reliance on meals that often lack nutritional balance.

Technology plays a pivotal role in shaping Gen Z's cooking habits and food choices. With apps and social media platforms at their fingertips, this generation has access to countless recipes and cooking tips. Yet, the paradox lies in the fact that digital resources often promote visual consumption rather than hands-on practice. While technology can be a double-edged sword, the benefits of learning to cook extend far beyond mere meal preparation. Cooking fosters creativity, enhances mindfulness, and can lead to healthier eating habits.

The implications of a generation that struggles in the kitchen could be far-reaching. Without essential cooking skills, Gen Z may face challenges in making informed food choices, resulting in reliance on less healthy options. Bridging this gap between technology and cooking can empower young individuals to embrace cooking as a vital life skill. By harnessing the digital tools available and fostering an interest in cooking, Gen Z can transform their relationship with food for the better, leading to healthier lifestyles and a deeper appreciation for home-cooked meals.",1,1765725968.0,EasyRecipesHub,0,1.0,False

Day 12,505

The joke about the biomass shielding isn't funny anymore.

I tried to get into the gym this morning for my mandatory cardio. There was a forty-five-minute wait for a treadmill. I ended up jogging laps around the perimeter of the cargo bay, dodging crates of synthesized protein powder and getting yelled at by a logistics officer who didn't appreciate me sweating on his manifest.

The ship feels like a pressure cooker. It’s not just the physical space; it’s the heat. 1,500 bodies generate a lot of thermal energy, and the environmental regulators in the primary ring are running at 98% capacity just to keep the temperature at a comfortable 22 degrees.

I cornered August in the mess hall during lunch. He was hiding behind a tablet, pretending to study a schematic.

""We have to do it,"" I said, slamming my tray down.

He flinched. ""Do what? If this is about the treadmill, I can override the lock for you. Perks of engineering.""

""No, August. The Expansion. We need to open the Reserve Wing.""

He groaned, actually groaned, and let his head hit the table. ""June, please. Do you have any idea what that involves? It’s not just pushing a button. We have to repressurize a section of the ship that has been in a vacuum for thirty-four years. We have to check five thousand miles of electrical conduit for degradation. We have to flush the water lines.""

""The air recyclers are wheezing, August,"" I pointed out. ""Tori says the CO2 levels in the school sector are creeping up. It’s making the kids drowsy.""

""I can tweak the scrubbers,"" he bargained. ""I can overclock the fans. Just... give me a month. I don't want to spend the next six weeks crawling through maintenance tubes vacuuming up space dust.""

""Dad says the ship handles better if the mass is distributed,"" I lied.

""Dad flew this thing when it was lighter than a feather,"" August shot back. ""He doesn't have to calibrate the inertial dampeners for a shifting hull geometry.""

He’s stalling. We all are. We’ve become comfortable in our cramped little city. The idea of opening a dark, cold, empty cavern next door is terrifying. It means acknowledging that this journey is getting bigger than us.

Day 12,512

The decision was made for us today.

I was on the bridge, monitoring the approach vector for a cluster of comets we need to navigate around. The ship was quiet—or as quiet as it gets these days.

Suddenly, the lights died.

Not a flicker. A hard cut. For three seconds, the only light came from the stars streaking past the viewport and the emergency LEDs on my console. Then, the alarm blared.

“Environmental Failure in Sector 3. Circuit Overload. Rerouting power.”

The lights buzzed back on, but they were dimmer. The air circulation fans kicked in with a loud, unhappy rattle.

I punched the comms. ""Engineering, report!""

""We popped a breaker,"" August’s voice came through, sounding breathless. ""Main junction box A-7. It melted, June. Literally melted. Too much draw. Between the school’s new servers, the farm’s extra grow-lights, and everyone charging their tablets at the same time... the grid couldn't take it.""

""Is everyone okay?""

""Yeah, just a scare. But we’re on backup relays now. If we blow those, we lose life support in the dormitory ring.""

I leaned back in the pilot’s chair, staring at the blue-shifted stars. We are traveling faster than light, bending physics to our will, and we almost died because too many people plugged in their hair dryers.

""That's it,"" I said. ""Prepare the Expansion Protocol. I'm waking up the Captain's Council.""

""Fine,"" August sighed. ""But you're helping me clean the toilets in the new wing.""

Day 12,515

The Great Expansion began at 0800 hours.

We made an event of it. Since most of the crew wasn't even born when the ship launched, they have no concept of what this ship is actually capable of. They think the walls we see are the only walls that exist.

I announced it over the ship-wide PA. ""Attention all hands. Please secure loose items. We are initiating hull reconfiguration in T-minus ten minutes. Expect seismic activity.""

I watched from the bridge monitors. Dad came up to watch with me. He stood by the window, hands clasped behind his back, looking more excited than I’ve seen him in years.

""Here we go,"" he whispered.

I authorized the command sequence. EXECUTE PROTOCOL: WING B - DEPLOY.

A deep, resonant thrum vibrated through the floorboards. It wasn't a sound you heard with your ears; it was a sound you felt in your teeth.

On the external cameras, the massive hydraulic clamps along the starboard flank released. Clouds of crystallized gas—atmosphere that had leaked out over decades—exploded into the vacuum like glitter.

Slowly, agonizingly, the ship began to unfold.

It was like watching a metallic flower bloom. The Reserve Wing, a massive cylindrical habitation module that had been retracted against the main hull for aerodynamics during the launch, slid outward on massive rails.

The ship groaned. Metal shrieked against metal, scraping off thirty years of cold-welding.

""Structural integrity holding,"" I called out, my eyes glued to the stress gauges. ""Center of gravity is shifting. Compensating with thrusters.""

It took four hours. Four hours of grinding, shaking, and lurching.

When the locking clamps finally slammed into place with a boom that shook the coffee cup off my console, a cheer went up from the Engineering deck.

""Seal complete,"" August reported, sounding exhausted but triumphant. ""Pressure equalizing. Atmosphere is flowing into Wing B. Heating systems are online.""

""Welcome to the suburbs,"" I muttered.

Day 12,518

We opened the airlock to Wing B today.

I was part of the first scouting party, along with August, a team of sanitation workers, and curiously, Mom. She insisted on coming.

""I want to see the potential,"" she had said, clutching a datapad.

The airlock hissed open. A gust of stale, metallic air hit us. It didn't smell like the rest of the ship. It didn't smell like sweat, or food, or ozone. It smelled like... nothing. It smelled like 1995.

We walked into the main corridor of the new wing. It was pristine. The floors were shiny, untouched by scuff marks. The walls were a stark, blinding white, unlike the slightly yellowed panels of the main ship.

""It's a ghost town,"" August whispered, his voice echoing.

He was right. We walked past rows of empty cabins, their mattresses still wrapped in plastic. We found a secondary cafeteria with chairs stacked on the tables, covered in a fine layer of dust. We found a gymnasium with equipment that looked brand new, archaic models compared to what we use now, but unused.

""Look at this space,"" Mom breathed, spinning around in what was designated as 'Recreation Hall B'. ""We can move the secondary school here. The younger children can have their own sector. We can set up a real laboratory.""

""And I have to inspect every single one of these light fixtures,"" August grumbled, shining his flashlight at the ceiling.

But even he couldn't hide the relief. We walked for an hour and didn't see another soul. No crying babies. No lines. Just space.

""Hey,"" I called out to August. ""Found the bathrooms. Here's your mop.""

He threw a roll of duct tape at me.

Day 12,525

The migration has started, and it is a logistical nightmare, just as we feared.

People are creatures of habit. Even though they complained about the overcrowding, nobody wants to move to the ""Ghost Wing."" They say it’s too quiet. They say the lights are too bright. They say it’s too far from the main cafeteria.

""I've lived in Cabin 402 my entire life,"" one of the senior mechanics told me. ""I'm not moving to Sector B just because it has a bigger closet.""

So, we had to incentivize it.

I updated the crew roster today.

\* Priority Transfer: Families with more than two children.

\* Incentive: Private showers in the new cabins (a luxury we haven't had in the main ring since Day 1).

Suddenly, the waiting list for Wing B is three pages long.

Dad is helping coordinate the move. He’s in his element, organizing logistics, directing traffic, telling the younger generation how to pack a crate properly. He looks ten years younger.

I was on the bridge tonight, running the evening diagnostics. The ship feels different now. Heavier, yes, but more stable. The ""wobble"" we used to feel in the gravity plating during high-velocity turns is gone. The wider stance has stabilized us.

I pulled up the navigation chart.

Distance to Galactic Center: 15 Years.

Current Velocity: 1.05e9 km/h (Effective FTL rating)

We are getting there. And now, we have room to breathe.

August called me from the new wing. ""Hey, June. You need to come down here.""

""I'm on duty, August. What broke?""

""Nothing broke. Just... come to the new Observation Deck. You have to see this.""

I left the autopilot engaged and took the tram to Wing B. The tram ride itself took ten minutes—the ship is massive now.

I found August standing in the new observation gallery. It’s huge—a floor-to-ceiling glass wall that curves along the hull. Because this wing sticks out further than the main ring, the view is unobstructed by the engines.

""Look,"" he pointed.

To the side, where the stars usually streak by as lines of white, there was something else. A faint, swirling haze of density. A nebula, light years away, passing in a blur.

But ahead... ahead, the blue shift was intense. The stars weren't just blue points anymore; they were smearing into a violet tunnel.

""We're hitting the density spike,"" August said quietly. ""We're really entering the core regions.""

I stood next to him. My annoying little brother. The genius mechanic.

""The ship is ready,"" I said. ""We have the space. We have the power. We can make it.""

""Yeah,"" he smiled, looking at the violet light reflecting in the glass. ""But I'm still not cleaning those toilets by myself.""

1pmgmqj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmgmqj,"Drama Smackdown: Enemies to Lovers (Or: When ""I Hate You"" Means ""I Want to Kiss Your Face Off"")"," **Greetings,** reformed haters, people who've ever argued with someone and thought ""God, they're hot when they're angry,"" and everyone who's ever confused fury with arousal!

 This week on **Drama Smackdown,** we're diving face-first into the most sexually charged hatred in entertainment history: enemies to lovers. Where two people despise each other with the burning passion of a thousand suns, fight constantly, and then suddenly realize all that tension was just foreplay.

 Because apparently, wanting to strangle someone is actually just unresolved sexual tension wearing a disguise.

 **TL;DR:** The enemies-to-lovers trope follows a forensically precise formula where mutual hatred transforms into mutual obsession through forced proximity, vulnerability, and the horrifying realization that the person you can't stand is actually the person you can't live without. It's the ultimate ""I was wrong about you"" journey, and we're addicted to watching people fight their feelings harder than they fight each other.

 Sadly, vertical dramas give us the discount version—enemies for maybe 15 minutes before they're making out in a wine cellar. But when it's done RIGHT? *Chef's kiss.* Pure gold.

 Let's break down the formula that makes us fall for people who should definitely have restraining orders against each other.

 

 **SCENE 1: THE ANTAGONISTIC MEET-CUTE (Or: Hatred at First Sight)**

 **The Setup:** Two people cross paths under the WORST possible circumstances. They're competing for the same job, stuck on opposite sides of a business deal, or literally trying to destroy each other's companies. Whatever the reason, it's personal, it's immediate, and it's WAR.

 **The Beat:**

* The collision: spilled coffee, stolen parking spot, public humiliation
* First impressions are TERRIBLE: ""You're the most arrogant/annoying/insufferable person I've ever met""
* Immediate verbal sparring that's a little TOO clever
* Both of them are infuriatingly attractive while being infuriating
* The insults are SPECIFIC—they actually pay attention to each other
* ""I hope I never see you again"" (Narrator: They will see each other every day)
* Friends notice: ""Wow, you two have insane chemistry"" / ""That's HATRED"" / ""Sure, Jan""
* The grudge is established: This. Means. War.

 **The Payoff:** They walk away furious, plotting revenge, and absolutely NOT thinking about how good the other person looked while destroying them verbally. Definitely not.

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 The initial hatred has to be REAL and JUSTIFIED. We can't root for the romance if one person is just being a jerk for no reason. They need to have legitimate grievances, actual conflict, real reasons to despise each other.

 The verbal sparring establishes their equality. They're matched intellectually, professionally, and in sheer stubbornness. Nobody's winning these fights—they're perfectly balanced in their mutual loathing.

 Most importantly, the audience needs to feel the SPARK. Even while they're fighting, we can see what they can't: this isn't just anger, it's electricity. The chemistry is so intense it's practically nuclear, and they're channeling it into hatred because attraction is too dangerous to acknowledge.

 **SCENE 2: FORCED PROXIMITY HELL (Or: The Universe Hates Us Both)**

 **The Setup:** Just when they think they'll never have to see each other again, fate (or a meddling boss/friend/contract) forces them together. They're working on the same project, trapped in the same space, or legally bound by some arrangement they can't escape.

 **The Beat:**

* The horrified realization: ""You're my new partner/roommate/co-lead?!""
* Attempts to get out of it: ""I'll pay someone. Anyone. Please.""
* Forced to spend hours together daily
* The petty warfare begins: passive-aggressive notes, sabotage attempts, territory disputes
* But also... they're competent? Annoyingly competent?
* Unwilling respect starts creeping in: ""Okay that idea was... not terrible""
* They start learning each other's routines, habits, quirks
* The insults get more personal because they're PAYING ATTENTION
* Moments of accidental teamwork that actually... work?
* The cognitive dissonance: ""I hate them but I also respect them and that's confusing""

 **The Payoff:** They're stuck in this weird limbo where they can't escape each other, can't stop noticing things about each other, and are starting to realize that maybe, possibly, the other person isn't COMPLETELY awful. Just mostly awful. Probably.

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 Forced proximity is the ENGINE of enemies-to-lovers. You can't go from hatred to love in one conversation, you need sustained exposure. They need time to see beyond the antagonism to the person underneath.

 This scene forces them to move past surface-level hatred into actual understanding. They learn WHY the other person is the way they are. They discover unexpected competencies, hidden vulnerabilities, surprising humor. The person they thought they knew becomes complicated, dimensional, HUMAN.

 The petty warfare is crucial because it keeps the tension alive while allowing intimacy to grow. They're still fighting, but now the fights are charged with something else—awareness, attraction, the horrifying possibility that they might actually LIKE this person.

  **SCENE 3: THE CRACK IN THE ARMOR (Or: Vulnerability Is the Ultimate Plot Twist)**

 **The Setup:** Something happens that strips away the antagonism for one crucial moment. Someone gets hurt, admits a fear, shows weakness. The mask slips and suddenly they're not enemies, they're just two people having a real moment.

 **The Beat:**

* The triggering event: injury, personal crisis, emotional breakdown, too much alcohol
* One of them shows up when they didn't have to
* ""What are you doing here?"" / ""I don't know. Shut up.""
* Unexpected gentleness from the ""enemy""
* A confession: childhood trauma, family pressure, why they're really such a mess
* The other person LISTENS instead of using it as ammunition
* A moment of physical care: bandaging wounds, steadying them, actual tenderness
* The horrified realization: ""Oh no. They're not just hot. They're... complex.""
* Trying to rebuild the walls immediately: ""This doesn't change anything""
* But it absolutely changes everything

 **The Payoff:** They can't unsee what they just saw. The enemy they've been fighting isn't a villain, they're a damaged person doing their best. And that's so much harder to hate.

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 This is the PIVOT. The moment where hatred can't survive because understanding replaces it. You can't truly hate someone once you've seen their scars.

 The vulnerability has to be EARNED. We need to believe they wouldn't show this to anyone else, that something about their enemy made them feel safe enough to drop the armor. The fact that they're showing weakness to the person they're supposed to be destroying? That's intimacy on a nuclear level.

 The immediate attempt to rebuild walls is crucial because it shows they KNOW this changes things. They're trying to protect themselves from the scariest realization of all: they might actually care about this person.

 **SCENE 4: THE ""OH FUCK I ACTUALLY LIKE THEM"" PANIC (Or: Denial Isn't Just a River in Egypt)**

 **The Setup:** They can't deny it anymore. The hatred has transformed into something terrifying: actual feelings. And they're SPIRALING.

 **The Beat:**

* The realization hits at the worst possible time
* Watching them laugh with someone else and feeling... jealous?
* ""Why do I care if they're on a date? I HATE them. I'm supposed to hate them.""
* Physical reactions they can't control: racing heart, sweaty palms, obsessive thoughts
* Fighting the feelings HARDER than they ever fought each other
* ""This is temporary insanity. Stress-induced hallucinations.""
* Trying to recreate the old hatred: picking fights, being extra antagonistic
* But the insults don't land the same way anymore
* Accidental soft moments: inside jokes, protective instincts, genuine smiles
* The internal war: ""I can't like them. I WON'T like them.""
* But they do. They absolutely do.
* The confession (usually mid-argument): ""Because I LOVE you, you idiot!""
* Shocked silence. Then: ""...What?""

 **The Payoff:** Everything they've been fighting against, all that resistance, all that denial—it explodes in one moment of terrifying honesty. The enemy becomes the person they can't live without.

 **Why This Scene MUST Happen:**

 The panic is the FUN part. Watching someone realize they've fallen for their enemy and losing their entire mind about it? Peak entertainment. The internal civil war between their brain (DANGER) and their heart (BUT THEY'RE HOT) is delicious chaos.

 The confession has to happen during conflict because that's THEIR language. They don't do soft declarations, they fight their way into love just like they fought their way into each other's lives.

 The ""you idiot"" part is crucial because it shows the exasperation of loving someone who drives you insane. It's not a fairy tale confession—it's messy, frustrated, real. ""I love you AND you're infuriating"" hits different than ""I've loved you all along.""

 

 **THE PSYCHOLOGY: Why We're Obsessed With Weaponized Sexual Tension**

 **The Equality Fantasy:**

 Enemies-to-lovers only works when both parties are MATCHED. Same intelligence, same strength, same level of competence. The attraction is built on respect that had to be earned through combat.

 We're obsessed with this because it promises a relationship of equals. No power imbalance, no pedestals, just two people who've seen each other at their worst and still choose each other. They can't idealize each other because they've been in the trenches together.

 **The ""They See Me"" Validation:**

 Your enemy pays MORE attention to you than anyone else. They know your weaknesses, your patterns, your tells. When that intimate knowledge transforms from tactical advantage to genuine understanding? That's the ultimate validation.

 They've seen you at your absolute worst—petty, cruel, vulnerable—and they love you anyway. Not despite who you are, but BECAUSE of it. That's the fantasy: being fully known and fully loved.

 **THE VERTICAL DRAMA PROBLEM: When Enemies Speedrun to Lovers**

 Here's my beef with how vertical dramas handle this trope: they give us enemies for approximately 8 minutes before everyone's making out.

 Vertical format is BUILT for quick emotional beats, which works for some tropes but MURDERS enemies-to-lovers. This trope needs time. You can't hate someone in episode 1 and love them by episode 3 without it feeling hollow.

 The forced proximity phase? Condensed to one locked room scene. The vulnerability crack? One crying scene and we're done. The denial panic? Girl, we don't have TIME for denial, kiss already!

 It's like watching the sparknotes version of a complex novel. You get the IDEA of enemies-to-lovers without the actual EXPERIENCE of it.

 **When it works in verticals:** Shows that use the format's frequent episode releases to stretch the tension across weeks. You get small doses of antagonism building into something real.

 **When it fails:** Everything that makes enemies-to-lovers WORK gets sacrificed for pacing. We're told they hate each other, see one fight, and then they're declaring eternal love. Ma'am, that's not enemies-to-lovers, that's enemies-to-lovers-because-the-script-said-so.

 

 **Final Verdict?**

 The enemies-to-lovers trope is the ultimate ""I was wrong about you"" journey, wrapped in verbal warfare and sexual tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.

 It's the promise that someone who's seen you at your absolute worst—petty, cruel, vulnerable, desperate, can still look at you and think ""yes, THIS disaster, I want this one.""

 **P.S.—Want REAL enemies-to-lovers that doesn't speedrun the good parts?**

 While vertical dramas are giving us discount enemies-to-lovers (enemies for 10 minutes, lovers for 40 episodes), I'm over here writing a [dark romantasy set in Atlantis ](https://www.amazon.com/Under-Fractured-Soulbound-Lament-Book-ebook/dp/B0G4F2N6V9?ref_=ast_author_mpb)where the enemies phase actually lasts. You know, the way it's supposed to? Where hatred is earned, proximity is torture, and the transformation takes actual time because good things are worth suffering for?

If you're tired of enemies-to-lovers that rushes through the best part—the ENEMY part—stick around. I'll let you know when you can read about characters who actually hate each other properly before falling catastrophically, devastatingly in love.

 Because I believe in doing this trope JUSTICE, not just vibes and speedrun kisses. 💀

 💥 **This has been another Drama Smackdown**—where we examine why ""I hate you"" is just ""I love you"" in a disguise that needs more therapy.

 **What's your favorite enemies-to-lovers moment?** The initial antagonistic meeting? The forced proximity hell? The vulnerability crack? The panicked ""oh no I have FEELINGS"" realization? Let's fight about it in the comments. (See what I did there?)

1pmgm9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviewpreparations/comments/1pmgm9e/my_managers_behavior_today_towards_a_nervous/,My manager's behavior today towards a nervous interviewee was a huge red flag.,"I saw something at work this afternoon that really showed me how some companies view their interview candidates. We're a small company, and we had a few interviews scheduled. As one was finishing up, the next candidate was waiting in the reception area near our desks. She hesitantly approached my desk and said, ""I'm so sorry to bother you, and I'm very embarrassed, but I'm feeling unwell. I didn't eat breakfast and drank too much coffee, and I'm feeling dizzy. Is there anywhere nearby where I can get a snack or something to drink?""

I've personally been in that situation, and besides that, I'm job hunting myself these days so I know how mentally taxing interviews can be. I told her not to worry at all, to just have a seat, and I'd get her a bottle of juice and some crackers from the kitchen. I didn't want her to feel any more embarrassed or stressed. She was clearly very self-conscious, but I acted like it was no big deal, because it really wasn't. I heard her interview went really well after she took a minute to compose herself.

But, as soon as she left, my manager leaned over to me and said, ""Why are you being so nice to them? They're just interview candidates. You don't need to do all that. Don't waste the company's snacks on them."" I was honestly shocked. Yes, they're people applying for a job, but ultimately, they're human beings who get nervous and anxious just like any of us. I can't imagine anyone accepting a job with a manager like that if they heard him say such a thing. It was a bottle of juice that cost next to nothing.

1pmglv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmglv2/the_truth_about_flexible_scheduling_in_accent/,"The truth about ""flexible scheduling"" in accent coaching (most programs are lying to you)","**The truth about ""flexible scheduling"" in accent coaching (most programs are lying to you)**

I work with non-native professionals shopping for accent coaching, and I see the same frustrating pattern: programs advertise ""flexible scheduling,"" but when you actually try to book a session, you get three time slots per week—all during your work hours.

Here's the problem nobody talks about upfront.

**The real scheduling challenge:**

You're impossibly busy. Back-to-back meetings, project deadlines, trying to have a personal life. The idea of adding ""weekly accent coaching sessions"" to your calendar feels laughable.

So when you hear about online coaching, your first question isn't ""Will this work?"" It's ""When on earth would I actually do this?""

And here's the catch: ""flexible"" is one of those marketing buzzwords that can mean almost anything. One program's ""flexible scheduling"" means you can choose from their three available time slots each week. Another's means you can book sessions at 6 AM or 10 PM, reschedule with 24 hours notice, and pause for a month without penalty.

**The difference between real flexibility and marketing spin:**

Real flexibility means the program adapts to your schedule and needs. Marketing flexibility means you're still the one doing all the accommodating.

I see this constantly with clients who've tried other programs first. They signed up for ""flexible online coaching,"" then discovered:

* Sessions only available during their work hours
* Rescheduling requires 72 hours notice (impossible when client emergencies happen)
* Miss two sessions and you're dropped from the program
* All credits expire in 90 days whether you use them or not

That's not flexible. That's just slightly less rigid than in-person classes.

**What genuine flexibility actually looks like:**

**Scheduling flexibility:**

* Book sessions at times that work for your calendar (early mornings, evenings, weekends)
* Reschedule without penalty if something comes up (usually 24-48 hours notice)
* Adjust session frequency up or down based on current workload
* Take breaks during busy periods without losing progress or your coach

**Format flexibility:**

* Choose between one-on-one sessions, group classes, or self-paced modules
* Switch between live sessions and recorded content based on weekly needs
* Access materials on-demand when you have 15 free minutes

**Pace flexibility:**

* Accelerate through material you find easy
* Slow down on challenging pronunciation patterns
* Set your own goals and timelines rather than following rigid curriculum

The question is: Who's accommodating whom? In genuinely flexible programs, the coaching bends to your life. In rigid programs with flexible marketing, you're still the one bending.

**The scheduling spectrum (finding what actually works for your life):**

There's no one-size-fits-all. What works for someone with predictable 9-5 hours is a disaster for someone managing teams across three time zones.

**Daily micro-sessions (15-30 minutes, 4-5x per week):**

What it looks like: Short check-ins, often asynchronous—you record, coach reviews and responds. Focus on one specific sound per session.

Best for:

* People who struggle with consistency in longer, weekly commitments
* Busy professionals who can carve out 15 minutes during lunch but can't commit to hour-long blocks
* Learners who need constant accountability

The tradeoff: Less comprehensive feedback per session. Can feel fragmented if you need deep work on complex patterns.

Real example: A software engineer schedules 20-minute sessions at 7 AM before his first meeting. He records himself reading a technical passage, his coach reviews it by noon and sends targeted corrections, and he practices during his afternoon coffee break.

**Weekly deep-dives (45-60 minutes, once per week):**

What it looks like: Comprehensive feedback covering pronunciation, rhythm, intonation. Homework assignments between sessions.

Best for:

* Professionals with relatively predictable schedules
* People who benefit from structured, in-depth instruction
* Learners who can dedicate practice time between sessions

The tradeoff: Requires blocking substantial time weekly. Miss a session and you've lost a week of progress.

Real example: A healthcare administrator books every Thursday at 6 PM after work. She knows this slot is sacred, plans her week around it, and uses the weekend to practice drills.

**Biweekly or monthly maintenance (every 2-4 weeks):**

What it looks like: Less frequent live sessions. Intensive practice on your own between check-ins. Coach acts as progress auditor rather than primary instructor.

Best for:

* Advanced learners who've mastered basics
* Self-motivated individuals who practice consistently without external accountability
* People with unpredictable schedules who can't commit weekly

The tradeoff: Progress is slower without frequent coaching. Easy to fall off the wagon between sessions. Not suitable for beginners.

Real example: An executive who already speaks clearly but wants to polish subtle intonation patterns books monthly sessions. Between meetings, he records client calls, self-assesses, and brings specific questions to the monthly deep-dive.

**Intensive sprint programs (3-5 sessions per week for 2-4 weeks):**

What it looks like: Multiple sessions per week. Laser focus on specific goals like upcoming presentations or interviews. High time investment with clear endpoint.

Best for:

* Preparing for high-stakes events with firm deadlines
* Professionals who can clear their calendar for a focused period
* People who thrive on intensity and want rapid results

The tradeoff: Demanding time commitment. Risk of burnout if sustained too long. Expensive if paying per session.

Real example: A product manager has a conference keynote in four weeks. She books three 60-minute sessions per week, practices 30 minutes daily, and focuses exclusively on presentation delivery and stress patterns.

**The format question (it's not just about when, but how):**

**Live one-on-one video coaching:**

Maximum personalization. Real-time correction. Fully customized to your challenges.

Flexibility factors:

* Schedule sessions when it works for you (if coach availability allows)
* Adjust focus each week based on what you're struggling with
* Record sessions for review anytime

When it's worth it: You have specific, stubborn pronunciation issues. Your industry uses specialized vocabulary. You benefit from immediate correction rather than delayed feedback.

**Small group classes (3-8 participants):**

Structured curriculum with peer interaction. Lower cost per person.

Flexibility factors:

* Fixed schedule (less flexible than one-on-one)
* Can't customize content to your specific challenges
* But: scheduled time creates accountability many people need

When it's right: You thrive in collaborative environments. Budget is a constraint. You benefit from social pressure of showing up for a group.

**Self-paced modules:**

Pre-recorded lessons available 24/7. Progress at your own speed.

Flexibility factors:

* Practice at 6 AM or midnight—whenever you have time
* Revisit challenging content as many times as needed
* No pressure to keep up with a group

The hidden inflexibility: Requires extreme self-discipline. No accountability if you skip practice for weeks. Can't get personalized feedback on your specific pronunciation errors.

When it works: You're exceptionally self-motivated. Your schedule is so unpredictable that scheduled sessions are impossible.

When it doesn't: You need external accountability. You're not sure which sounds you're mispronouncing. You benefit from real-time correction.

**Adjusting as your needs change (this is the real flexibility test):**

Your needs at week 1 are radically different from week 12, which are different again from month 6. The most flexible programs recognize this.

**Critical questions to ask before committing:**

""Can I increase from biweekly to weekly sessions if I'm making rapid progress?""

""Can I decrease frequency if my work schedule gets crazy, without losing my coach or package credits?""

""Can I pause my package for 2-4 weeks without sessions expiring?""

""Will I lose my preferred coach if I need to take a month off?""

""Can I switch between one-on-one and group formats mid-program?""

**Red flags:**

* Programs that lock you into specific frequency for entire package duration
* ""All sessions expire in 90 days, no exceptions""
* ""Miss two sessions and you're dropped""
* No pause option at all

**Green flags:**

* Coaches who proactively suggest adjusting frequency based on your progress
* 30-60 day freeze option
* Extended expiration dates (6+ months) that accommodate real-world chaos
* Ability to transfer credits between formats

**The time zone nightmare (if you're managing global teams):**

If you're managing teams in Singapore, clients in New York, and reporting to London, finding a coach whose availability overlaps with your waking hours can be the biggest flexibility challenge.

**What to look for:**

Coaches with non-traditional hours:

* Early morning or late evening availability in their time zone
* Weekend sessions
* Willingness to accommodate ""off hours"" by appointment

Asynchronous options:

* Record-and-review systems where you submit practice recordings and get feedback within 24 hours
* No need for real-time overlap

Geographic diversity:

* Platforms with coaches in multiple time zones
* Ability to switch coaches if you relocate

**Testing flexibility during your trial (most people miss this):**

Most people only evaluate teaching quality during trials. They forget to test the scheduling system itself.

**What to actually test:**

Try booking your second session. Is it seamless or frustrating?

Ask to reschedule the trial. How accommodating is the response?

Check the platform's user experience—can you easily access materials, recordings, schedules?

**Questions to ask:**

* ""How far in advance do I need to book sessions?""
* ""What's your cancellation policy if something comes up?""
* ""How do you handle rescheduling—is there a penalty or limit?""
* ""Can I book sessions irregularly based on my workload, or do you require weekly consistency?""

**The practical takeaway:**

True flexibility requires active participation from both sides.

Your responsibility:

* Communicate schedule changes proactively, not last-minute
* Be honest about what's working and what isn't
* Adjust your plan based on results, not just comfort
* Practice between sessions—flexibility doesn't mean zero commitment

Your coach's responsibility:

* Offer genuine scheduling accommodation within reason
* Provide clear policies about cancellations, pauses, rescheduling
* Adapt teaching approach to your pace and priorities
* Give honest feedback about whether your chosen frequency is sufficient for progress

When both sides hold up their end, flexible programs deliver results that rigid schedules can't match.

**What to ignore:**

The idea that ""flexible"" means ""optional"" or ""whenever you feel like it."" Real progress still requires consistent practice and accountability. The flexibility comes in *how* and *when* you do that work—not *whether* you do it.

Also ignore programs that offer ""ultimate flexibility"" through 100% self-paced content with zero live interaction. For most people, that's not flexibility—it's a recipe for never actually doing the work.

**The uncomfortable truth:**

A program can offer incredible scheduling options, format variety, and pace adjustability—but if you don't communicate your needs, adjust as circumstances change, and take ownership of your progress, all that flexibility becomes meaningless.

The whole point of online coaching is to make pronunciation improvement accessible to people with demanding lives. You shouldn't have to quit your job or abandon your family to speak clearer English.

But find a program that genuinely accommodates your schedule, offers formats that match your learning style, and allows you to scale up or down as life changes. Then commit to using that flexibility strategically, not as an excuse to procrastinate.

1pmgjyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmgjyl/your_first_accent_coaching_session_will_feel/,Your first accent coaching session will feel awkward. Here's exactly what happens (so you can prepare instead of panic),"I work with professionals booking their first accent coaching sessions, and I hear the same anxious questions every time: ""What exactly happens in that first hour? Will I be put on the spot? Will it be embarrassing?""

Here's the truth nobody tells you upfront.

**The problem with first sessions:**

You've paid for coaching, blocked time on your calendar, and now you're about to log into a video call with a stranger who's going to listen very carefully to how you talk—and then tell you everything you're doing wrong.

It's vulnerable. You're hyper-aware of every word coming out of your mouth. You'll probably stumble on sounds you normally get right just because you're nervous.

And the uncertainty makes it worse. You don't know what's coming, so you can't prepare, which makes you more nervous, which makes your accent thicker.

I see this constantly: smart, accomplished professionals psyching themselves out before their first session because they're imagining some kind of high-pressure pronunciation exam where they're graded and found wanting.

**Here's what actually happens (and why it's not scary):**

Your first session isn't about proving how good your English already is. It's about establishing a baseline, building rapport with your coach, and creating a roadmap.

Think of it like a doctor's initial consultation. Before they can treat you, they need to understand your symptoms, run some tests, and figure out what's actually going on. Your coach is doing the same thing with your accent.

**What your coach is listening for:**

* Which specific sounds consistently trip you up
* Whether you have rhythm and intonation patterns from your native language bleeding into English
* How you handle word stress in multi-syllable words
* Whether your speech rate is too fast, too slow, or inconsistent
* Where your pronunciation breaks down under pressure (spontaneous speech vs. reading)

**What you should be assessing:**

* Do I feel comfortable with this coach's teaching style?
* Can they explain phonetic concepts in ways I actually understand?
* Do they seem experienced with speakers from my language background?
* Is the platform easy to use, or will technical issues eat into every session?

Both of you are gathering data. That's normal. That's productive. And it means you shouldn't judge your entire coaching experience based on how you feel in minute fifteen when you're stumbling through a tongue twister.

**The typical first session flow (what happens minute by minute):**

Most first sessions are 45-60 minutes and follow a similar structure.

**Phase 1: Introduction and goal alignment (5-10 minutes)**

This isn't small talk—it's strategic information gathering.

Your coach will ask:

* What brought you to accent coaching?
* What specific situations cause communication challenges?
* What are your professional goals for the next 3-6 months?
* Have you done any pronunciation work before?

What you should volunteer:

* Your native language (helps them anticipate common challenges)
* Your industry and role (so they can tailor vocabulary and scenarios)
* Any high-stakes events coming up (presentations, interviews, conferences)
* Specific sounds or words you know you struggle with

This is also your chance to ask about their coaching approach, typical timeline for results, and how they structure sessions going forward.

**Phase 2: Diagnostic assessment (15-20 minutes)**

This is where your coach gathers data. It might feel like you're being tested—because you are. But it's not pass/fail; it's ""what needs work and what's already solid.""

Common assessment activities:

*Reading aloud:* You'll read a paragraph or passage. This shows how you handle pronunciation when you have time to think.

*Spontaneous speech:* You might describe your job, explain a recent project, or talk about your weekend. This reveals what happens when you're not carefully monitoring your speech.

*Targeted sound production:* The coach may ask you to repeat specific words or minimal pairs (""ship"" vs ""sheep,"" ""vest"" vs ""west"") to pinpoint exactly which sounds need work.

*Stress and rhythm exercises:* You might repeat sentences with different stress patterns to test your ability to emphasize the right words.

What this feels like: Honestly? A bit awkward. You're hyper-aware of every word. You might stumble on sounds you normally get right just because you're nervous.

What to remember: Your coach has heard hundreds of non-native speakers. They're not judging you—they're gathering diagnostic information. The more naturally you speak, the more accurate their assessment will be.

**Phase 3: Initial feedback and prioritization (10-15 minutes)**

This is the ""aha"" moment where your coach tells you what they're hearing and what you should focus on first.

Good feedback sounds like:

* ""Your vowel sounds are quite clear, but you're consistently substituting /v/ for /w/ in words like 'very' and 'work'""
* ""Your rhythm is choppy because you're stressing every word equally instead of emphasizing content words""
* ""You have excellent pronunciation in prepared speech, but your fluency drops significantly when you're thinking on your feet""

Vague, unhelpful feedback sounds like:

* ""You just need to practice more""
* ""Your accent is pretty strong""
* ""Try to sound more American""

Questions you should ask:

* ""Which one or two sounds should I prioritize first?""
* ""Is this challenge common for speakers with my language background?""
* ""How long does it typically take to correct this pattern?""
* ""Can you show me the tongue/mouth position for this sound?""

**Phase 4: Mini-lesson and practice (10-15 minutes)**

Most coaches don't just assess and send you on your way—they give you a taste of what actual coaching sessions will feel like by working on one specific challenge.

You might practice:

* Correct tongue placement for a problem sound
* Minimal pair drills to train your ear to hear differences
* Sentence stress patterns using phrases from your work
* A short exercise in connected speech (how native speakers link words together)

Why this matters: By the end of your first session, you should walk away with at least one concrete technique you can practice immediately. This builds momentum and confidence.

Active participation tips:

* Repeat sounds out loud, even if it feels silly—this isn't a passive experience
* Ask for clarification if you can't feel the difference the coach is describing
* Don't be afraid to say ""I'm not getting this—can you explain it differently?""

**Phase 5: Next steps and scheduling (5-10 minutes)**

The session winds down with logistics and planning.

You'll discuss:

* Homework assignments (usually 10-15 minutes of daily practice)
* Resources to use between sessions
* How often you should meet (weekly? biweekly?)
* When to schedule your next session

What to clarify before you log off:

* How will you receive session notes or recordings?
* What should you bring to the next session?
* How should you communicate between sessions?
* What's the cancellation policy if your schedule changes?

**How to prepare so you don't waste that first hour:**

Most people book a trial and show up cold. That's like test-driving a car without knowing what features you need.

**Before you book: Get crystal clear on your goals**

""I want to improve my accent"" is not a goal. It's a wish.

Instead, try:

* ""I need to stop being asked to repeat myself in client meetings""
* ""I want to nail the pronunciation of medical terminology so patients understand critical instructions the first time""
* ""I'm interviewing for a leadership role in three months and need to sound confident in presentations""
* ""I struggle with the American 'R' sound and it's affecting how people perceive my technical expertise""

Why specificity matters: Your coach can immediately tailor the session to your actual needs. If you're preparing for interviews, they'll focus on common interview questions and professional vocabulary. If patient communication is your challenge, they'll work on medical terms and clear, calm delivery.

**Before your session: Test your tech**

You're paying for 45-60 minutes of expert guidance. Don't waste the first 15 troubleshooting your microphone.

Non-negotiable tech checks:

* Audio quality – Can your coach hear subtle pronunciation differences?
* Video quality – Can your coach see your mouth clearly? (Lip and tongue position matter)
* Internet stability – Test your connection with a friend on the same platform
* Software familiarity – Know how to share screen, mute/unmute, and record

Pro tip: Do a 5-minute practice call with a friend the day before. Figure out the controls when the stakes are low.

**Before your session: Prepare your environment**

Your first session requires focus. Background noise, interruptions, and multitasking will sabotage your ability to hear subtle corrections.

Create a coaching-friendly space:

* Quiet location – Close the door, silence your phone
* Good lighting – Your coach needs to see your face clearly
* Comfortable setup – You'll be speaking for an hour
* Water nearby – Your mouth will get dry

What to have ready:

* Any materials your coach requested (presentation slides, challenging vocabulary list)
* Your calendar to schedule follow-up sessions
* Notebook for taking notes

**Bonus prep: Record a baseline sample**

Send a 2-3 minute recording before your first session to make that hour dramatically more productive.

What to record:

* 60 seconds reading a standard passage
* 60 seconds of spontaneous speech on a work-related topic
* 30 seconds listing challenging words from your industry

Why this helps: Your coach can review it before you meet, identify your top 3-5 challenges, and come prepared with targeted exercises instead of spending your paid time on basic diagnosis.

**After your first session: Making it stick**

Here's where most people drop the ball: they leave feeling motivated, then do nothing with that momentum for a week. That's like going to the gym once and expecting results.

**Review session materials immediately (within 24 hours):**

* Session notes or recording (if your coach provides them)
* The top 2-3 pronunciation patterns you're working on
* Homework assignments and practice recommendations

Why the 24-hour window matters: Wait a week and you'll have forgotten half of what your coach said.

**Start daily practice immediately:**

The single biggest factor in accent improvement isn't coaching frequency—it's daily practice between sessions. Even 10 minutes a day beats an hour once a week.

Minimum effective dose:

* 5 minutes of targeted sound drills (the specific sounds your coach identified)
* 5 minutes of reading aloud, recording yourself, and listening back
* Bonus: Shadow a podcast or video for 5-10 minutes to work on rhythm

How to build the habit:

* Tie practice to an existing routine (morning coffee, commute, lunch break)
* Set a phone reminder
* Track your streak (even a simple checkmark on a calendar works)

**Prepare questions for your next session:**

As you practice, you'll hit roadblocks. Write them down.

Good questions to track:

* ""I can make the /r/ sound in isolation, but it disappears in sentences—why?""
* ""How do I know which syllable to stress in words I've never heard before?""
* ""I recorded myself and still can't hear the difference between my /v/ and /w/—can we work on this?""

**Evaluating fit: Is this the right coach for you?**

Your first session isn't just about you being assessed—you're also assessing the coach.

**Green flags (signs of a great coach):**

* Clear, specific feedback – They tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
* Patient explanations – They don't get frustrated if you don't ""get it"" immediately
* Structured approach – You can see there's a plan, not just random drills
* Industry awareness – They understand your professional context and tailor examples accordingly
* Realistic timelines – They're honest about how long improvement takes

**Red flags (signs to keep looking):**

* Vague feedback – ""Just practice more"" or ""Try to sound more natural""
* No structured plan – The session feels improvised and unfocused
* Dismissive of your goals – They push their agenda instead of working with yours
* Overpromising results – ""You'll sound native in 6 weeks!""
* Poor communication – They don't respond to emails, provide unclear homework, or seem disorganized

What to do if it's not a fit: Be honest. If the coaching style doesn't work for you, it's better to find someone else than to waste time and money on a mismatch.

**The practical takeaway:**

Walk into your first coaching session with curiosity, not anxiety. You're not being graded. You're gathering information—about your pronunciation, about your coach, about whether this investment makes sense for you.

The best first sessions leave you with three things:

1. Clarity about what needs work
2. Confidence that it's fixable
3. A concrete plan for what to practice this week

If you get those three things, you've had a successful session—regardless of how ""good"" your accent sounded in the moment.

**What to ignore:**

The fear that your accent is ""worse than you think."" So what? Knowing the truth is better than guessing. If your pronunciation needs more work than you realized, at least now you have a plan to fix it.

Also ignore the idea that you should nail every exercise in session one. You won't get everything right immediately. That's why you're hiring a coach. Their job is to break down complex movements into steps you CAN do.

**Common anxieties that aren't worth the mental energy:**

""What if the coach thinks I'm hopeless?"" → Professional coaches have worked with people at every level. If they thought you were hopeless, they wouldn't take you as a client.

""What if I waste money on something that doesn't work?"" → That's why first sessions exist—to test fit before committing to a package.

""What if I can't do the exercises correctly?"" → You're not supposed to master them in one session. That's literally what the ongoing coaching is for.

Your first session is a beginning, not a test. Show up prepared, stay curious, and remember that every expert coach has heard hundreds of accents worse than yours—and helped those people improve.",1,1765725691.0,intonetic,0,1.0,False

That almost never worked for me. What finally did was  flipping the idea and attaching the habit to the END of something instead. 

Our brains seem to remember endings way better than beginnings. Finishing coffee, closing your laptop, turning off the shower, locking the door. Those moments already feel complete, like a natural full stop.  When I started saying “when this ends, I do X”, the habit stopped feeling optional. For example, when I finish brushing my teeth, I stretch for one minute. When I close my work laptop,  I quickly write down tomorrows first task. No motivation, no hype, just a handoff. 

The surprising part is  how sticky this gets over time. Endings are predictable and mentally clean, while starts are messy and easy to delay. Tying habits to endings turns them into automatic follow ups instead of decisions you can argue with.

My usecase is mostly city commute, gym, cafes, friends meetup, and occasional monthly highways rides. 
i had duke 250, duke 390, adventure 390x, speed 400, t4, guerrilla 450 as my options.

Bit on background:
i dont hv too much experience on riding bike, i own a scooter, but i have done touring on rental and friends bikes, and there were hiccups of course while riding. 

i did not like how duke felt ergonomics wise, but i guess i would gotten used to it. Duke 250 felt juiceless in lower revs, also its rear brakes sucked. i took its TD at 3 showrooms, all of them had bad rear brakes.
duke 390 scared me, yet i managed to TD it 4 times, cuz i really wanted this bike. I saw multiple reviews on how good this bike is, but i did not feel confident enough on this, you know it’s instinct that i might crash this. 
390 adventure x: seat height was on the taller side. i was able to manage. The engine heated a lot while i was taking a ride. In addition, 4.3 lac (on road in bangalore felt) a bit of overstretch for me, given that i won’t be offroading. Took 2 TD, engine would heat up quickly, but easier to ride than duke 390 for sure, not that aggressive. 

speed 400: felt instantly connected with the bike. i was able to handle it very well, it’s a torquy machine but not that intimidating. Engine was very smooth in lower and mid revs, definitely smoother than duke 390. Once i took back to back TD of 390 duke and speed 400, and i could feel the difference. One extra point to showroom folks at triumph, they were so cool, they let me ride it for over 30 minutes. They were genuinely interested in customers, nothing bad from ktm but triumph folks did a phenomenal job. They even offered me coffee, who does that. 

speed T4: little upright compared to speed. ergonomics wise A+, but i could feel it is less powerful as compared to speed 400. 

guerilla 450: didn’t take TD as RE folks weren’t interested in to let me have the ride, so gave up. It doesn’t come with traction control which i felt should have been there. 

what do you guys think? what things i should be mindful of while riding speed 400, also what accessories should i get on this bike?

1pmgf4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmgf4w/reality_check_free_trials_with_accent_coaches/,"Reality check: Free trials with accent coaches exist, but most people waste them","I work with non-native professionals who are shopping for accent coaching, and I see the same pattern constantly: they book free trials with 3-4 coaches, have nice conversations, and then... have no idea who to pick.

Here's the problem nobody talks about.

**The real issue with ""free trials"":**

Most people treat trials like casual coffee chats. They show up unprepared, ask generic questions like ""so what do you do?"", and leave with a vague sense of whether they ""liked"" the coach. Then they're stuck making a decision based on feelings instead of data.

This is backwards. You're about to invest hundreds (maybe thousands) of dollars and months of your time. The trial isn't just a ""let's see what happens"" conversation—it's your one chance to test-drive before committing real money.

Yet most professionals waste this opportunity because they don't know what to actually test.

**What ""free trial"" actually means in accent coaching:**

Not all trials are created equal. Here's what you'll actually encounter:

**The 15-30 minute consultation (most common):**

* Quick conversation about your background and goals
* Brief diagnostic (read a passage, answer some questions)
* Overview of their programs and pricing
* That's it

You get a taste of their personality, but not much actual coaching. Best for testing rapport and asking specific questions about their approach.

**The one-week platform access (less common):**

* Full access to self-paced materials and practice drills
* Progress tracking dashboards
* Sometimes one live group Q&A session
* But usually NO personalized one-on-one feedback

Good for testing whether you can actually learn from self-paced content or if you need live coaching. The platform might be slick, but if you won't use it, it's worthless.

**The full single session trial (rare, but gold standard):**

* Complete 45-60 minute coaching session
* Comprehensive pronunciation assessment
* Detailed feedback on your top challenges
* Targeted practice on specific sounds
* Homework assignment

This is the real deal. You get actual value even if you don't continue. Coaches offering this are either new and building clientele or extremely confident in their value. Either way, take advantage when you find it.

**How to find these trials without endless searching:**

**Strategy 1: Check coach websites directly** Look for ""free consultation"" or ""free assessment"" buttons on their homepage or pricing page. If you don't see it, just ask via their contact form: ""Do you offer a free trial or introductory session?""

Many coaches will offer one even if it's not advertised—they'd rather give you one free session than lose you to a competitor.

**Strategy 2: Use coaching platforms** Sites like Preply or Verbling often have ""first lesson discount"" policies. Sign up, filter for accent coaches (not general ESL tutors), and book trials with 2-3 different coaches to compare.

Warning: Platform coaches can be hit or miss. Check reviews carefully.

**Strategy 3: Ask in professional communities** LinkedIn groups for international professionals or Slack communities for non-native English speakers are goldmines. Ask: ""Has anyone worked with an accent coach who offers free trials? Looking for someone experienced with \[your native language\] speakers.""

You'll get referrals plus insider info on which trials are actually valuable vs. marketing gimmicks.

**What to actually test during your trial (this is the important part):**

Forget ""do I like this person?"" That's not enough. Your trial needs to answer specific questions about ROI.

**Test 1: Can they diagnose your challenges quickly?**

Within 10-15 minutes, can they identify your top 2-3 pronunciation patterns?

Good diagnosis sounds like: ""I'm hearing consistent /v/ to /w/ substitution, which is very common for native Mandarin speakers. You're also flattening your intonation in questions. Let's prioritize those two patterns.""

Vague diagnosis sounds like: ""Your accent is pretty strong. We'll work on making you sound more native.""

Quick, accurate diagnosis means they've seen hundreds of accents and know exactly what to work on. Vague feedback means they're winging it.

**Test 2: Can they explain phonetics without jargon?**

Ask them to explain how to make a sound you struggle with. Do they use technical terms you don't understand, or do they break it down clearly?

Good explanation: ""For the American /r/, pull the back of your tongue up toward the roof of your mouth without letting it touch. Your tongue tip should float in the middle. It'll feel weird, almost like you're getting ready to growl.""

Unclear explanation: ""You need to produce a retroflex approximant with the tongue in a bunched position.""

If you can't understand their explanations during the free trial, you'll struggle with homework during paid sessions.

**Test 3: Can they connect to your real-world scenarios?**

Share a specific professional situation where pronunciation matters—client presentations, team meetings, interviews. Do they immediately tailor examples to your context?

Good coaching: ""Since you're in sales, let's practice the /th/ sound using phrases like 'I think this solution' and 'Let me walk you through the numbers.' We'll work on those exact sentences so the pronunciation becomes automatic in your pitches.""

Generic coaching: ""Let's practice /th/ with this tongue twister: 'The thirty-three thieves…'""

Generic drills don't transfer to real-world use. Context-specific practice does.

**Test 4: Is the platform actually user-friendly?**

Test these during your trial:

* How easy is scheduling and rescheduling?
* Can you access session recordings easily?
* Are materials simple to find?
* Is the audio quality clear enough for pronunciation feedback?

Red flags: Complicated scheduling, laggy audio, no access to recordings. Technical friction wastes your time and money.

**Test 5: Do you feel comfortable making mistakes?**

When you mispronounce something, does the coach correct you supportively or judgmentally?

Supportive: ""Almost! You're getting the tongue position right, but your lips need to be more rounded. Try again—'work, work, work.' That's it!""

Discouraging: ""No, that's wrong. Listen again."" \[repeats without explanation\]

You're going to make thousands of mistakes during coaching. If you feel judged during the trial, you'll feel that way during paid sessions—and that kills progress.

**Test 6: Can they articulate a clear plan?**

Ask: ""Based on what you've heard today, how would you structure coaching for me? What's a realistic timeline?""

Good answer: ""I'd start with your top 3 problematic sounds—/r/, /v/, and vowel reduction. We'd spend weeks 1-4 building muscle memory in isolation, then weeks 5-8 integrating them into work scenarios. Most clients with your background see significant improvement in 8-12 weeks with weekly sessions and daily practice.""

Vague answer: ""We'll work on whatever you need. Everyone progresses at their own pace.""

A structured plan means they know what they're doing. Vague promises mean you're paying for improvisation.

**Questions that actually matter:**

Don't waste time on small talk. Ask these:

**About their expertise:**

* ""Have you worked with many \[your native language\] speakers? What patterns do you typically see?""
* ""What's your background in phonetics or accent coaching?""
* ""Do you specialize in any industries?""

**About their approach:**

* ""What does a typical session look like?""
* ""How much homework should I expect?""
* ""Do you provide session recordings or written notes?""

**About pricing and policies:**

* ""What are your package options?""
* ""Do sessions expire, or can I pause if needed?""
* ""What's your cancellation policy?""
* ""Any satisfaction guarantees?""

**About outcomes:**

* ""What's a realistic timeline for improvement?""
* ""How will we measure progress?""
* ""What happens if I'm not seeing results?""

Coaches who overpromise (""You'll sound native in 6 weeks!"") are red flags. Honest coaches give realistic timelines.

**How to prepare so you don't waste your trial:**

Most people book and show up cold. That's like test-driving a car without knowing what features you need.

**Before you book:** Write down:

* Your specific pronunciation challenges (be specific: ""I struggle with /th/ sounds"" not ""my accent is bad"")
* Professional situations requiring clear speech
* Your budget
* Ideal session frequency

**Before your session:** Record yourself for 2-3 minutes:

* 1 minute reading a passage
* 1 minute describing your job (spontaneous speech)
* 30 seconds listing words you struggle with

This gives the coach data to work with and shows you're serious.

**During your session:** Take notes on:

* Specific sounds they identify as challenges
* Teaching techniques they use
* Your gut reactions—supportive? overwhelming? condescating?

**After your session:** Create a simple scorecard rating each coach on:

* Diagnostic accuracy
* Teaching clarity
* Platform usability
* Pricing fit
* Gut comfort level

Emotion fades. Data doesn't. A scorecard lets you make a rational decision.

**Red flags to watch for:**

**High-pressure sales:**

* ""This discount is only available today""
* ""I only have 2 spots left this month""
* Spending more time upselling than coaching

**Overpromising:**

* ""You'll sound completely native in 8 weeks""
* ""My method works for everyone""
* ""You don't need to practice between sessions""

**No clear methodology:**

* Trial feels improvised
* Can't explain their teaching approach
* No mention of phonetics or systematic practice

**Dismissive of your goals:**

* ""That's not realistic""
* Ignoring your professional context for generic exercises

**The practical takeaway:**

Free trials aren't favors coaches are doing for you. They're mutual evaluations. You're assessing them just as much as they're assessing you.

Approach trials strategically:

* Prepare specific questions
* Test teaching abilities, not just personality
* Compare objectively using scorecards
* Don't settle for ""good enough""

**What to ignore:**

The idea that you should pick the first coach you ""click with."" Chemistry matters, but competence matters more. A coach you like who can't diagnose your issues will waste your money just as much as a skilled coach with a terrible platform.

Also ignore time pressure. Don't let ""limited spots"" rush you into a decision. Good coaches will still be there in a week.

**Reality check:**

Trial 2, 3, or even 4 coaches before committing. The investment is too significant to settle. One more trial might be the difference between marginal improvement and transformative results.",1,1765725343.0,intonetic,0,1.0,False

Fast forward – the app now has 43k+ downloads, 550+ ratings, averages ⭐️ 4.8 stars on the App Store. Not exactly viral, but still way beyond what I expected.

My friends didn't mean any harm back then; they just weren't the target audience. So I've learned to trust my gut and just build things I would genuinely love to use myself, hoping there are some other folks out there who feel the same.

To be honest, with my new app ***Prime Timer***, the skepticism was even louder:

# ""Who needs another timer?""

And fair enough — iOS already has one built into the Clock app. But it hasn’t really changed in years, and I’ve always missed a few simple things.

# ✨ Here’s what makes Prime Timer different:

1. Progress bar on the Lock Screen — see exactly how much time is left, at a glance.
2. Ultra-minimal interface — literally nothing on screen but the timer.
3. No leading zeroes — 7 seconds shows as “7”, not “00:07”.
4. QuickDial™️ — a fast new way to set a timer instantly.
5. Control Center integration — toggle or launch your timer directly (even from the Action Button 🔘).

It’s **free** (with no in-app purchases), handcrafted for **iPhone & iPad**, and deeply integrated into iOS.

It comes with:

* Widgets in multiple sizes
* Live Activities with progress bars
* System alarms that sound just like Apple’s
* Haptic & acoustic feedback
* Full dark mode support

Perfect for:

* Working out
* Focusing
* Workshops
* Cooking
* Making tea or coffee
* Meditation
* Speaking on stage

Befohand, sorry about the big post. I've started the adventure into special coffes at the start of 2025 and I understand that I have a good equipement for the time that I'm onto this hobby.

  
I have a 1Zpresso K-ultra and I mainly just use the pourover methods but I do have V60, Origami, Clever, Aeropress and French Press, but, it doesn't matter what I do, she always says that is ""too accidty"" or ""too bitter"" and throws a spoon of suggar.

  
Here in Brazil I only buy great coffes from their own roaster and with fresh roasting date (1-2 days, but only opens from day 4).

  
Sincerely I don't know what to do to satify her. I already changed my receipe, grind size, method... and the feedback is always the same. I even made coffee to other people and had no complaint, but who knows if it wasn't just people not trying to be mean haha.

  
Usually I use Kasuya method (1:15 - 1:16) with a grind size of K-Ultra 0.8.0 to 0.8.5 depending on the amount of beans that I use (20-25g).And yes, my grinder is calibrated to the real 0.



To me, my coffee is pretty good, some florish, some butterish, but, no matter what I do,  I can't satisfy her and it bothers me a lot. Is there any good soul to help me? Or should I just accept that ""She doesn't like coffee"" and this is how life goes?

1pmgasr,https://www.reddit.com/r/intonetic/comments/1pmgasr/the_one_thing_nobody_tells_you_about_improving/,The one thing nobody tells you about improving your English speaking (and it's stupidly simple),"I work with non-native professionals every day—software engineers, lawyers, finance people—and the question I get most is ""how do I actually get better at speaking English?""

Here's what surprises everyone: **you probably already know what your problems are, you just haven't confirmed them yet.**

**The problem most people face:**

They have this vague sense that they ""don't sound right"" or ""need to improve,"" but they can't pinpoint what's actually wrong. So they end up doing random practice that doesn't move the needle. It's like trying to fix a car without knowing which part is broken.

I see this constantly with my clients. They'll come to me saying ""I just need to work on my accent"" or ""I need to sound more professional."" But when I ask them what specifically is causing issues, they can't tell me. They just know something feels off.

**Here's what actually works:**

Record yourself. Seriously, that's it. Pull out your phone, open voice memos, and talk for 2-3 minutes about literally anything—what you did yesterday, your job, a short article you read, or answer a common interview question.

Then listen back. Not to cringe (though you will), but to actually *hear* the patterns:

* Do you say ""um"" or ""like"" constantly? Count them. Seriously, tally it up.
* Are there specific sounds you consistently mess up? (Most common: ""th,"" ""r,"" ""v"" vs ""w"")
* Is your pacing choppy or too fast? Or weirdly slow?
* Does your voice sound flat, like you're reading a grocery list?

One trick that's been eye-opening for my clients: run your recording through a speech-to-text tool. You'll instantly see which words you're mispronouncing because they'll show up as completely different words. Had a client who thought he was saying ""think"" but it kept transcribing as ""sink."" That's when the lightbulb went off.

**The stuff nobody talks about: sentence stress**

Here's something that blew my mind when I first learned it, and it's a game-changer for sounding natural.

In English, we don't stress every word equally. We emphasize certain words to change meaning. Take this sentence: ""I didn't say he stole the money.""

* Stress ""I"" → someone else said it
* Stress ""say"" → you implied it but didn't say it
* Stress ""he"" → someone else stole it
* Stress ""money"" → he stole something else

Same sentence. Completely different meanings. This is why you can have perfect grammar and vocabulary but still sound ""off"" to native speakers.

Try this: pick one sentence and record yourself saying it multiple times, stressing a different word each time. When you play it back, you'll hear how drastically the meaning shifts. This alone will make you sound more fluent than 90% of learners who only focus on vocabulary.

**Why this matters:**

Once you know your *specific* problems, you can set *specific* goals. Not ""speak better"" (useless), but ""reduce my 'um' count by 50% in two weeks"" or ""master the American 'r' sound in daily 10-minute drills.""

This is the difference between someone who practices English for years and barely improves versus someone who makes rapid progress in months. The second person knows exactly what to fix.

**Here's my actual practice framework:**

Forget the idea that you need 2-hour study sessions. That's a myth. What actually works is micro-habits—1-5 minute bursts throughout your day:

* **Narrate your commute:** Describe what you see out loud. ""That cyclist is weaving through traffic. The bus just pulled up. Someone's running for the train."" Feels weird at first, but it's incredible for building spontaneous speaking.
* **Summarize podcasts:** After a 5-minute segment, pause and summarize the key points out loud in under two minutes. Bonus: this also trains your listening comprehension.
* **Think out loud in English:** Making coffee? ""Okay, first I need to grind the beans. Now I'll heat the water. This is taking forever."" Simple stuff, but it gets your brain defaulting to English.

Then layer on structured weekly practice:

* Monday: Schedule a 30-minute language exchange call
* Wednesday: Record a 5-minute mock presentation on a work topic
* Friday: Listen to Wednesday's recording, identify one issue (pacing, filler words, whatever), then re-record focusing only on fixing that one thing

The daily habits build reflexes. The weekly structure builds skills. Together? Unstoppable.

**The practical takeaway:**

* Record yourself once this week (2-3 minutes, anything)
* Listen for patterns, not perfection
* Pick ONE thing to work on first
* Do micro-practice daily (even just 5 minutes)
* Re-record in two weeks to see progress

**What to ignore:**

Trying to sound ""perfect"" or exactly like a native speaker. That's not the goal. The goal is being clearly understood the first time you speak. Your accent is part of your identity—keep it. Just make sure it's not blocking your message.

Also ignore the idea that you need expensive software or courses to start. Your phone's voice recorder is literally all you need for the first month of serious improvement.

**The real breakthrough:**

The data backs this up too—Cambridge research shows hitting intermediate fluency takes 600-1000 hours of focused practice. Recording yourself makes sure every hour you invest is actually fixing your real issues, not imaginary ones.

I've seen people transform their speaking in 3-6 months with this approach. Not because they're talented, but because they're practicing the right things consistently instead of randomly.",1,1765725038.0,intonetic,0,1.0,False

My husband (48M) and I (47F) have a 6-year-old daughter. She was a surprise. We didn't think we could conceive naturally. I'll save that story. Anyway, he is permanently disabled. He developed a condition currently in diagnosis (a seizure disorder, triggered by overexertion, heat/humidity, but mostly, loud, high-pitched, sudden noises) in 2007, 2 years after we were married. In 2013, he was diagnosed with Afib and Leukemia, 2 years after he got his degree and started teaching. He went out on disability to start his chemo; I don't think he went back after that. He's now permanently disabled and on SSDI, but in order to get that, you have to STOP working. It takes 2-5 years. I couldn't pay our mortgage and all the bills AND our medical bills myself. We had to put our house on the market and do a short sale so we could move back home with his parents.

For years, even when he was going through his mystery illness, he begged to have a kid. I told him we had to wait. He had to finish school. He had to have a salary. (He was working as a sub at the time...usually full-time, but at the end of his program, he had to go day-to-day and was hardly making anything.) We had to move closer to home. I was terrified of having a child with no support! No help! Especially in his condition. And I was more flexible on this one, but I wanted his condition diagnosed. I wanted to know what we were dealing with. He was aggravated with me, and said I just didn't want to have a kid, that's why I was putting so many conditions on it. I was just being practical.

This is just my opinion: when my husband wants something, he tends to run headlong into it, damn the consequences. That's how we got stuck in our house. I eventually agreed to it, but I didn't want to get stuck in a mortgage, I wanted to go home! At the time, though, there weren't any other better options. Rents were sky-high, we had a dog, everyplace decent was going condo.  It was 2008.

We agreed to the terms, but he said if we got to a certain point, it would just be too late. He decided that was about age 36. I was 35.

We didn't make it back home till 2016. I was 38. I didn't care, I was ready to call the cryobank and have a baby, but he was done with the matter. 2 years difference, all of my conditions ""met"" - sort of - and I am desperate for a child. He won't even discuss it. I'm devastated.

2 years pass, we started looking for a house (no go) because his parents are as well. We get frisky, and surprise surprise: that swelling and nausea for the last 2 months is actually a lovely gift. 🎁🎉🧧🎐🧨

Now we are in our house that my mom had to buy for us; we pay her. The deal is supposed to be he is the homemaker and I support us. He is our daughter's primary caretaker. As a baby, he cared for her full-time, and now that she's in school, it's a bit different.

Reading that post, there was a lot that resonates: we all know about all the invisible labor that goes into homemaking, raising kids, taking care of finances...

He doesn't do ANY OF IT!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬💩☠️

He cooks and does the dishes.
I finally instituted 'meal nights' to end the constant ""what should we have for dinner?"" since he never actually planned meals.
That made it easier for me to try to get the groceries we need. Still, can't tell you how many times I've gotten ""we can't have X tonight because we're out of it."" Can you pick up some take out? (And I already have to do take out every time he goes down before or while making dinner...3x/week on average)
No meal planning. No grocery lists. No grocery shopping. We shop online!! And getting him to 'check the cart' to see if I missed anything is already a pain in the ass; for him to then throw in beer and two $10 bags of coffee is like adding insult to injury.

He ""gets"" the kid to the bus stop. (Read: he follows her there.) He also goes there to meet her. If her hair isn't brushed, he'll ""finger comb"" it - because he was in bed until it was time to go to the bus stop.

We live in a bachelor pad. I can't stand it, but I also feel like he's not the same as everyone else. He has limitations. 

And in spite of those limitations, I still feel like he's behaving like a man-child. He once managed his own classroom. He was made a long-term sub in classrooms where he had to teach subjects he didn't know. He had to teach them to himself. Art was one of them. Science and math were others. He was in charge of a Sophomore English SpEd classroom for a YEAR. Driver's Ed and health for another. He coached softball. These all require serious problem solving and critical thinking. That tells me that the weaponized incompetence is STRONG in this case.

I should also note that I'm disabled as well. I have several disabling pain conditions, including chronic migraine, occipital neuralgia, fibromyalgia, arthritis, lipo-lymphedema, myofascial pain syndrome, anemia...I could go on but I already sound like a hypochondriac. I took a year off when we first got home on disability insurance, found really good doctors and treatment, and got a decently-paying job with good insurance. I hate the people I work for, and am burned out beyond belief, so I'm miserable anyway.

We both medicate with MMJ. He has taken to spending most of his time in the garage. It's his ""quiet"" place. 

We have been in therapy for about a year and a half, but he usually takes over talking about day-to-day things rather than stuff that matters. I've even pointed this out. It's quite noticeable.

The post I referred to before talking about whose responsibility is whose and it was like...tried that. Was rejected. Tried to help. Was rejected or failed.

Let me break down his routine:

Gets up at 11:30AM. (Even weekdays. He goes back to bed after the bus stop if he doesn't have an appointment.)
Makes coffee.
Has his coffee in the garage - for a couple hours. Like, the whole pot.
Loads/Unloads dishwasher.
Plays computer games/watches TV until kid gets home at 4.
Kid goes to friends house OR friend comes over. Either way, he'll be in garage until I get home or it's time to cook dinner.

With school finishing and my son keeping us in the house most of the time, I figured now was a perfect time to start the hunts again. This pidove took an ungodly 13 phases. The shortest was 280 and the longest was 33,000. At phase 7 I switched from route 19 to Castelia city because I think it’s so unique that you can catch a pidove in b2w2 with a city as a caught location. It makes perfect sense as well. The second day I picked up the ds again, she decided to sparkle. I started using Lucky power 2 to decrease petilil and rattata spawns and increase eevee spawns instead. I figured if I was to phase again, better eevee than another rat or plant. I was speechless seeing her appear on the screen. I don’t even know what to do or say. I love these games, I love pidove, and I’m going to have such an experience finishing this dtq. Remember: you’re always one phase away from getting your target!

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

I’m stuck between two job offers and I’m trying to think about it in a rational way without over romanticizing either option

Offer A is fully remote and pays about €2200 per month net

Offer B is hybrid three days a week in the office and pays about €2900 per month net. Where I live 2900 is considered very good.

With the hybrid role I would spend around €40 per month on public transport and I’d lose roughly three hours on each office day once you include commuting and maybe more 40 minutes to get ready in the morning. There would also be small extra costs like grabbing lunch sometimes or coffees but I would try to bring food from home most days to keep it under control

Why I care

My main medium term goal is buying a house with my wife. We’re both 25. Higher stable income obviously helps with saving faster and it can make mortgage approval easier and less stressful. At the same time I care a lot about having time and energy outside of work because I’ve been trying to build personal projects

About personal projects

I’ve been working on side projects on and off and my goal is that they eventually turn into better career opportunities or even extra income. The honest version is that they have not produced much so far and it’s clearly risky to treat them as guaranteed future value. Still they matter to me and I know consistency is everything. I worry that hybrid plus commuting will make me come home tired and I’ll end up doing nothing productive in the evenings which would basically kill the one thing I’m trying to grow long term

What I’m weighing

With the hybrid offer I get more money now and potentially faster career growth if the role has better exposure and I can also build relationships in person. That extra €700 net per month is real and could move the house goal forward faster

With the remote offer I get less money but I keep a lot more time and mental bandwidth. I know I can keep a steady routine and stay consistent with learning and projects. I also suspect I’ll be happier day to day and more sustainable long term

My main fear with hybrid is taking it for the money and then burning out or hating the commute and wanting to quit early which would defeat the whole financial advantage. My fear with remote is staying too comfortable and leaving money on the table when I’m young and should maybe be optimizing income and career progression

If you were in my position how would you decide

How do you personally value time versus money in a situation like this

And for people who chose the higher paying hybrid option did you actually manage to keep side projects and growth going or did commuting kill it

Any advice or decision frameworks would be appreciated

UPDATE:

I used the real-cost-sim and I have for the remote role - 1451 kept over 146h worked. 9.94€ of disposable money for each hour and as for the hybrid 1842 and keep about 7.77€ of disposable money for each hour",1,1765724741.0,cscareerquestions,3,1.0,False

Spent 36 hours in Chicago for the first time on my two days off from work.

So I’ve been doing these “weekend warrior” trips since June ever since getting the travel bug. 

I’ve done NYC, Washington DC and now Chicago. 

I left Orlando on a Thursday at 8am and arrived at O’Hare at 11am. Hit the ground running and dropped off bags at the hotel (Loews Chicago) which was phenomenal. 

From there I walked towards Gino’s East (deep dish) and stopped at Stan’s Donuts for a sweet treat to get me going. Delicious!

Stopped at the Starbucks Reserve and that was the worst coffee in a beautiful building. Wasn’t hot, didn’t taste good and cost $11 for a grande latte. 

From there stopped at the Ralph Lauren store for a quick photo. 

Then on to Gino’s East for an incredible deep dish but filling. Almost killed my energy I was so full, lol. 

From there, went back to the hotel to freshen up. 

Took a Lyft over to Cindy’s Rooftop for a drink and walked down to the Christmas market. Was super packed so headed straight to Lincoln Park Zoo for an adults only light show event. Left there early since it was absolutely freezing and hit up a tiki bar speakeasy called Three Dots & a Dash that was located in an alleyway. Great drinks and excellent service. 

After that, crashed and was up early Friday morning. 

Walked towards “the bean” and hit up a diner for breakfast (Eggys).

Took some photos at the bean and enjoyed the view. Made the walk towards Sears Tower and went to the top. Incredible views and the Ledge had my palms so sweaty. 

From there I wanted Italian beef so we stopped at the one and only Mr Beef, featured in The Bear! Sooooo juicy. 

From there went and got on a boat for an architectural tour, which again, froze my ass off. Much colder than I anticipated. Well worth it though.

After that, hopped in a Lyft back to O’Hare and landed back in Orlando at 11pm. 

Did I want longer? Sure. Did I still enjoy the hell out of it? Absolutely.

1pmg2ik,https://i.redd.it/zjxa4rsbp67g1.jpeg,How to Make the Most of a Small Empty Lot for Rent,"Are you the recent discoverer of a small vacant plot for lease pondering how to optimize it? Whether you're a small enterprise proprietor, a community group in search of space for events, or an individual aiming to develop a small garden or outdoor living area, there are numerous possibilities for maximizing the potential of a small vacant plot for lease. In this piece, we will explore various concepts and approaches for fully utilizing a small vacant plot.\
Evaluating the Area and Purpose\
The first step in maximizing a small vacant plot for lease is to evaluate the area and establish its purpose. Consider the dimensions, form, and location of the plot, along with any imposed restrictions or limitations. If you're considering commencing a business, ponder over the kind of establishment you want to set up and how the plot can accommodate it. For an event space, contemplate the potential for seating, stage areas, and amenities. If your goal is to develop a garden or outdoor living area, ponder the soil quality, sunlight exposure, and potential for landscaping.\
Once you have a clear idea of the plot's purpose, you can commence brainstorming specific ideas and blueprints for how to make the most of it.\
Small Enterprise Opportunities\
For small business proprietors, a small vacant plot for lease can be an excellent prospect to launch a unique and inventive business. Here are a few ideas for businesses that can thrive in a small vacant plot:\
\
  Cramped Bistro or Alfresco Dining Space: If you have an interest in food and beverages, contemplate establishing a cramped bistro or alfresco dining space. With the proper design and arrangement, a small vacant plot can be transformed into a snug and appealing space for patrons to savor coffee, sandwiches, or other light refreshments.\
  Pop-up Store or Marketplace: For entrepreneurs with retail aspirations, a small vacant plot can be the perfect spot for a pop-up store or marketplace. Whether you're retailing handmade goods, vintage items, or fresh produce, a pop-up store can entice clientele seeking distinctive and local products.\
  Outdoor Fitness Center: Given the increasing demand for outdoor fitness alternatives, an empty plot can be revamped into an outdoor fitness center. Provide yoga sessions, boot camps, or other fitness activities in a unique and open-air setting.\
\
Community Event Space\
Small vacant plots can also function as cherished community event spaces, presenting a venue for assemblies, exhibitions, and other cultural activities. Below are a few proposals for converting a small vacant plot into a lively community event space:\
\
  Outdoor Movie Evenings: Construct a screen and seating in the plot for outdoor movie evenings. With the appropriate equipment and planning, you can create an enjoyable and unforgettable experience for movie enthusiasts in the community.\
  Performance Venue: Refashion the plot into a small stage area for live music, theater, or other performances. Ponder over setting up a basic platform, seating, and lighting for an intimate and hospitable performance space.\
  Community Garden: If there is enthusiasm for gardening and sustainability in the community, reflect on transforming the plot into a community garden. Provide plots for individuals or groups to cultivate their own produce and establish a beautiful verdant area in the heart of the community.\
\
Outdoor Living and Recreation\
For individuals or families aiming to make the most of a small vacant plot, establishing an outdoor living and recreation space can be a splendid way to optimize the space. Here are a few concepts for maximizing a small vacant plot for outdoor living:\
\
  Urban Garden: If you have a penchant for gardening, contemplate initiating a small urban garden in the vacant plot. Through raised beds and container gardening, you can cultivate a variety of vegetables, herbs, and flowers even in a confined space.\
  Pint-sized Playground or Play Area: For families with young children, a small vacant plot can be converted into a pint-sized playground or play area. Install a swing set, sandbox, and other play equipment to create a secure and entertaining space for youngsters to play outdoors.\
  Outdoor Seating and Dining Area: Establish a small patio, seating area, and outdoor kitchen to develop a cozy and hospitable outdoor living area. With the right design and furniture, you can fabricate a harmonious retreat for outdoor dining and relaxation.\
\
Design and Planning Considerations\
Irrespective of the specific purpose of the small vacant plot, there are essential design and planning considerations to bear in mind to utilize the space optimally:\
\
  Utilize Vertical Space: Given the restricted horizontal space, it's imperative to contemplate vertical usage. Consider utilizing wall-mounted planters, vertical gardens, and other vertical storage solutions to maximize space utilization.\
  Flexibility and Mobility: Owing to the impermanent nature of a small vacant plot for lease, it's vital to design and plan for flexibility and mobility. Employ portable or modular furniture, structures, and equipment that can be effortlessly shifted or reorganized as necessary.\
  Lighting and Ambiance: Take notice of lighting and ambiance to fashion a welcoming and attractive space. Employ string lights, lanterns, and other lighting alternatives to create a warm and inviting atmosphere for evening and nocturnal usage.\
  Accessibility and Safety: Ensure that the space is accessible and safe for all users. Contemplate adding ramps, handrails, and other accessibility features to accommodate individuals of all abilities.\
\
Permitting and Regulations\
Prior to executing any significant modifications or investments in a small vacant plot for lease, it's crucial to contemplate permitting and regulatory prerequisites. Depending on the location and planned application of the plot, there may be precise zoning, building code, and other regulatory considerations that necessitate attention.\
If you're concocting a business, event space, or other commercial usage, you may need to secure a business license, permits for alfresco seating, temporary structures, and other pertinent authorizations. Check with the local planning and permitting bureau to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations.\
For communal and recreational purposes, it's essential to take into account liability and insurance requirements. Based on the specific activities and applications of the plot, you may need to obtain liability insurance to safeguard yourself and others using the space.\
Engage the Community\
If you're contemplating the optimal use of a small vacant plot for lease for a communal or recreational intent, it's paramount to involve the community in the process. Seek input, feedback, and backing from local residents and community groups to ensure alignment of your designs with the community's needs and aspirations.\
Contemplate organizing community gatherings or workshops to compile ideas and input from local stakeholders. By involving the community in the planning and decision-making process, you can develop support and enthusiasm for your endeavor.\
Moreover, consider collaborating with local organizations, businesses, and leaders to harness resources, expertise, and support for your plans. Unions with local nonprofits, educational institutions, and community groups can amplify the influence and success of your endeavors.\
Creating a Vibrant and Sustainable Space\
In maximizing a small vacant plot for lease, it's pivotal to devise a vibrant and sustainable space that enriches the neighboring area and contributes positively to the community. Ponder over instituting sustainable and eco-friendly design and practices, such as employing recycled materials, fostering biodiversity, and minimizing waste and energy usage.\
If you're contemplating a garden or outdoor living space, contemplate integrating native plants, rainwater collection, and composting to establish a sustainable and ecologically conscious space. For businesses and events, think about eco-friendly actions like employing reusable cups and utensils, curbing single-use plastics, and minimizing waste.\
In addition to sustainability, contemplate establishing a welcoming and inclusive space that encourages a community and connection. Design the space to be inviting and accessible to individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities.\
Conclusion\
In conclusion, a small vacant plot for lease holds the capability to be a treasured and versatile space that can cater to an array of uses and activities. By assessing the area and purpose, contemplating design and planning considerations, and involving the community, you can make the most of a small vacant plot for lease and produce a valuable asset for your business, community, or personal usage.\
Whether you're a small business owner aiming to launch a distinctive business, a community group in need of event space, or an individual wishing to establish a garden or outdoor living space, the prospects for maximizing the potential of a small vacant plot for lease are boundless. With inventiveness, innovation, and cooperation, you can transform a small vacant plot into a lively and sustainable space that enriches the surrounding area and contributes positively to the community.\

Is there a way to print to a usb shared printer over Tailscale when I’m at a coffee shop with my travel computer? My assumption is that it if I have TS installed on the Mac at home, I should in theory be able to use the printer sharing option built into MacOS right? 

Correct me if I’m wrong. Or guide me in the direction of good printer server software if needed. Preferably free.

She has socialization problems, Daddy issues, relationship issues and just completely lost. It was weird because she started chatting with me, asking about relationships, asking for advise and poured her heart out with me asking. 

  
After finding out about all her perversions, social issues and anxiety I used it against her. We met up a few times a month to have coffee and talk and eventually she asked me if I could take care of her needs. I told her I could only if I'm the only one she sleeps with. 

  
So now she's my side chick with issues. She's happy to have someone who will listen to her, treat her like a human being and socialize normally with. In reality I check out every time I see her, her personality is crap and she's a very not likable person. But I just deal with it because I use her body like a doll and she loves it.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Edmonton Oilers vs. Montreal Canadiens: A Goalie’s Worst Nightmare or a Comeback for the Ages?**

The Oilers (-127) and Canadiens (+105) clash in a game that’s equal parts hockey spectacle and statistical paradox. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a blazer.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Oilers, led by Connor McDavid’s 18 goals and 33 assists, are slight favorites (55.9% implied probability). Yet their 54.5% win rate when favored at -127 suggests they’re just barely scraping by. The Canadiens, meanwhile, are underdogs (48.8% implied probability) but have a 53.8% win rate as +105 underdogs—a stat that screams “value bet” or “statistical fluke,” depending on your coffee intake.

The total is 6.5 goals, and both teams have combined for over that mark in 58% of their games this season. With the over priced at 1.95 (implied 51.3% probability), the line seems undervalued given their explosive history.

---

### Injuries: A Cast of Thousands (Minus the Stars)

The Oilers are missing Jack Roslovic, Kasperi Kapanen, and Jake Walman—defensive stalwarts who’ve been replaced by… well, let’s just say “depth players” and leave it at that. The Canadiens are even worse off, losing Patrik Laine and Alexander Newhook, two forwards who could’ve single-handedly powered a lesser team. Yet, here’s the kicker: *no injuries are listed for either team in the latest reports*. Either the NHL’s injury reporting is as reliable as a deflated puck, or both rosters are operating at full strength.

---

### News Digest: Jarry’s Circus Act and Canadiens’ Home-Court Advantage

The Oilers’ midseason acquisition of Tristan Jarry is a mixed bag. The former Penguin has a 2.66 GAA this season but a 3.12 GAA last year and a playoff résumé that reads like a cautionary tale. His

1pmfyl7,https://i.redd.it/s5ossbdpi67g1.jpeg,Review of Maison Alhambra Kismet for men : A sophisticated under rated fragrance,"Maison Alhambra's Kismet for Men was one of the most discussed fragrances among YouTube reviewers until 2023. At the moment, none of the reviewers talk about it. Either because there are lots of fragrances or they are not “incentivized” any more. It is inspired fragrance or clone of Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo and, Rochas Moustache EDP or By Kilian Straight to Heaven Extreme. There is a slightly more expensive clone as well, Afnan Turathi Brown.

**Classification**

Woody, Spicy, & Oriental. I find this DNA earthy.

**When I Bought It**

Possibly, 2022 or 2023, I don’t remember

**The Scent**

**Notes -what I can smell**

It is hard for me to pinpoint specific notes. Primarily, I can smell spicy notes and patchouli. It has woody and earthy feel. I cannot smell some of the notes distinctly like vanilla, cacao or coffee.

Is it for everyone?

In my opinion, this fragrance is not a mass pleasing DNA. It is a mature men’s fragrance and you need certain kind of persona to pull it off. A classy and sophisticated male who has finer taste in life.

**Performance, Longevity & Sillage**

Longevity: 4-7 hours depending on weather. In summers, it doesn’t last long. In winters it shines. On clothes, it lasts up to 24-30 hours. Overall, it is an average performer, in line with most designer fragrances.

Sillage & Projection: It is average. However, it shines in winters with above average projection especially in night. I have used this in Bangalore and Jaipur. In latter, during December nights, I love how it smells in the air.

**Wearability and Best Occasions:**

It is best suited for formal occasions in cold weather. Most suitable for winter day;  special occasions events like weddings etc.

It can also be used in office with max 1 or 2 sprays but I feel it is for someone who is a senior role person.

**Signature Scent Worthy?**

Yes. It's you won't find many wearing this DNA.

**Downside**

Personally, I don’t think this has any downside except for the cases where people prefer “beast” mode fragrance. The performance for Kismet for men is average.

**Final Thoughts & Alternatives**

It delivers a rich, complex, and classy scent profile with woody, spicy notes. It can be described as ""manly,"" ""unique,"" and ""sophistication in a bottle."" But I don’t think this is mass pleasing DNA and may not suit some personas. I have not tried Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo so I cannot compare it with the original inspiration. I have tried Rochas Moustache EDP and I have purchased this from the US and should be getting it soon for a better comparison. It smells very close to Moustache. I have tried Afnan Turathi Brown which is a denser clone. I find Kismet for me to be more airy and better suited for most occasions and it is cheaper. I feel there are very few occasions where one can use Afnan Turathi Brown.

**Overall, I feel Kismet for men to be a great value for money if you like Yves Saint Laurent's Tuxedo DNA.**",2,1765724169.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,1.0,False
1pmfy8q,https://i.redd.it/j83al1seo67g1.png,Victim of Red-1: Dreaming in Red,"

**Red**

There was only red, and an endless emptiness.

I drifted aimlessly amid a boundless expanse of red, like space smeared with blood, or a painting in which the artist wanted extreme detail on each and every brush, almost like a simulation of some abstract art that surround all around me, yet used nothing but red in varying shades, until it became an image that could be perceived as having meaning or form, while at the same time remaining impossible to understand or explain.

I could not see my hands, my legs, or my body, but I can see the shape of it, the shape of myself by the wave and ripple of those red things that I can't feel but can see it warping around me like thousands of thousands blood soaking snakes pass through me.
There was only the red void and confused thoughts swirling chaotically. I was like a thought drifting through this crimson chaos which surrounded me in all directions.

And within that red emptiness, I felt…

**Oppression.**

As if I were in the midst of a crowd pressing against one another, moving back and forth without regard for anyone else.

As if trapped in the congestion of a street with no exit, only countless vehicles piled atop one another, with no sky and no open space in sight.

I did not feel lonely, but rather as though I were being watched at all times by thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of eyes, staring as one, while I stood there as someone guilty of some grave crime.

Before I awoke from that dream, I saw something moving not far away, amid the red mist, amid a bottomless ocean of blood.

The oppression transformed into loneliness and aimlessness, as though I had been severed from a painful, brutal reality, isolated in something far beyond death itself.

Then I can see something, I can feel it.
Something long and massive, like the body of a giant serpent or the neck of a colossal dragon, swam through that red emptiness. It had no visible beginning or end, stretching onward to the very edge of the void and the silent, desolate solitude…

---

I was lying on a sofa.

My eyes were fixed on the white ceiling and a hanging lamp that cast a dim light.

Bam, my therapist, sat on a wooden chair, holding a notebook in which she occasionally wrote while I told my story.

She then began asking about myl life.

Had I ever been bullied?

No.

Do I have a bad relationship with my parents or family?

No.

She then shifted to asking about my working life, my eating habits, or stress.

No.

No.

No.

I answered only with the truth, and she found nothing abnormal, aside from this being just a strange dream.

But I knew well that she thought I was being uncooperative and lying throughout the questioning.

Was it merely a meaningless dream?

No.

It was not a meaningless dream.

No dream had ever haunted me like this.

No nightmare or horrifying image had ever embedded itself in my memory like this one.

Everywhere I turned to look,

In every corner of the darkness,

In every place the light reached,

I saw only red.

The color that chased me both asleep and awake, as though it had been permanently painted into my eyes.

I believed I was facing something beyond my own understanding, something greater than what I could see, perhaps some old forgotten thing, alien or extradimensional beings, maybe it was a test?

I don't know, but I was certain that I perceived only a small fragment of something far larger.

I dreamed the same dream again and again, until one day I came across a chat group.

In that group were people who had experienced different things, yet things that were connected.

Something that was merely a **color**, yet caused many to fear it or encounter it.

The group was called **Victim of Red**.

I read others’ experiences and shared my own dream there. Everyone expressed concern or offered advice. No one thought it was just a meaningless dream.

I spent several weeks immersed in that group, until I finally met someone who said she had experienced the same thing.

Her name was Jill. She said that the year before, she had dreamed the same dream as I had, the dream of that red emptiness.

I asked her how to stop dreaming about it. She answered simply: do not look at the color red. No matter what, do not look at or see it for 24 hours. And during that time, you must not sleep at all, or else you will fail.

And so I did exactly as she said.

I locked myself in my room, with food and water prepared for the entire day.

I made absolutely sure that there was nothing red in the room, nor anything that could produce the color red by any means whatsoever.

Then I waited, surrounded by thoughts of whether it would work or whether I would merely waste a day.

I decided not to look at social media, movies, or use any devices, fearing I might accidentally see red.

All I did was think, sit, lie down, wait, and think, my thoughts looping endlessly around whether it would succeed. But I did not sleep. I drank coffee constantly, knowing full well it was bad for my body, but I would never allow myself to sleep.

If I had to harm myself to stay awake, I would do it, even though there was a chance I might see my own red blood.

At first, I wanted to find a book to read, but I didn’t want to risk it, in case there was red, or even a tiny red dot, hidden inside.

I waited and waited…

Until finally the hands of the clock told me that I had been awake for 24 hours and had not seen any red at all.

I felt… happy and liberated, as though I had achieved the greatest desire of my life, as though I had accomplished something many others never could.

Then I lay down, this time not to pass time or to think, but to sleep and await waking up.

I closed my eyes and let myself drift into drowsiness and silence within a room devoid of red.

I fell asleep.

---

I became aware again, greeted by a familiar sight.

The color I had avoided all day revealed itself before me, around me.

A red emptiness, like mist in space, vast and endless, like a painting whose meaning was uncertain and undefined.

I screamed in defeat and despair, staring out into that red void.

I felt as though I were trapped in a nightmare with no end, and that I would never wake up.

But then I heard it.

A low sound, like the call of a whale.

It seemed not far away, and as though it were behind me.

I turned around.

Out of curiosity, only to end in terror.

That form—

It was there.

Behind me.

It had been there all along; I just hadn’t realized it.

A black form amid the red.

The upper half resembled a human, without arms, legs, face, or ears.

There was only the outline of a human shape.

Like someone who had been swallowed alive by a snake, appearing only as a protruding form from the serpent’s belly.

The lower half was made of dozens of gigantic octopus tentacles, stretching in every direction, vast as an entire mountain, extending endlessly.

And that sound—

The sound of loneliness.

It was like music of solitude.

A music without sound, and filled with sorrow.

---

I woke up.

Awoke from that endless dream.

I sat up and asked myself what could have caused me to encounter something like this.

Had I unknowingly done something, angered someone, or something?

I sat for hours, trying to think through many things: why, and what made Jill’s solution fail.

I was sure she hadn’t lied to or tricked me; she seemed to have truly experienced it herself.

I thought, grew stressed, and became sad. I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom.

I bent down to wash my face, then lifted my head to look in the mirror.

And then I saw it.

At that very moment, everything clicked into place with a sharp *click*, like a door bolt being unlocked.

Why hadn’t I realized it before?

When it must have been this way for quite some time already.

When surely others must have noticed and said something.

But why…

What I saw was my own face.

The face I was familiar with.

The face I had seen my entire life.

The facial structure that had not changed over the past twenty years.

But now, there was one difference.

The color of my eyes.

They were no longer black as before.

Instead, they had been replaced by a color I knew, and feared.

The color that had appeared in my dreams throughout this past month, the color that haunted so many people in the group chat.

What I saw in my eyes—

Was **red**.

She was kind of extremely rude but I kind of just put up with her, until she kept hanging up on me to get me to tell her something, and then we got into an argument, and I called her a couple bad names.

Then, that same day, I went out for a drive to get a coffee, and when I came back home, my family told me that while I was out, a black BMW pulled up in front of our house and two people tried to break down our door. And when they ran away back to the car, they held up a gang sign over their face.

I don’t understand that, and I don’t get how that could just be a coincidence. I still have the security footage, and their footprint is still on the door almost 12 months after, and nobody including me went to the police.

The girl I was talking to said her Dad was a massive drug dealer, and I learned today that there are certain operations in Canada, and I’m absolutely terrified to the bone that her Dad sent someone. And if that’s true, it means they’re big enough of an organization to operate nationwide. And I’m pretty concerned that I might get shot or something.

It’s been over 10 months since, but I have the security footage (front cameras of house). No license plate, and they were wearing masks and hoods.

When it happened I drove to my friends farm and stayed with him for like a month, before coming back home. And I kind of forgot about it after March, up until now.

I’m currently running a small browser-based game website called [quizpoker.app](https://quizpoker.app).  
Right now the site is available in German only; an English version is in progress.

I’ve tested Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee, but I’m not fully satisfied with either of them. What I’m missing in particular:

* A customizable progress bar I can embed on my website (e.g. *“10% of $240 goal reached”*)
* More control over the design of embedded iframes, widgets, and buttons so they better match my site’s UI
* No monthly subscription or base fee (transaction fees are fine)

The goal is simple: allow players to voluntarily support the project directly on the website in a transparent and visually appealing way.

Ideally I’m looking for:

* One-time donations (no forced subscriptions)
* Embeddable widgets or APIs
* Reasonable design flexibility (CSS, parameters, or self-hosted components)
* No monthly costs

If you’ve built something similar or know platforms that might fit (or even self-hosted / open-source solutions), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.

Thanks in advance!",1,1765723957.0,webdev,2,0.67,False

1pmft12,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1pmft12/i_left_america_and_it_stopped_my_no_buy/,I left America and it stopped my no buy,"Over the summer, I decided to leave the United States and live with my grandma for three months. I am fully remote with work, so I had the flexibility to do that. She lives in a developing Mediterranean country. Things like Amazon technically exist there, but it is not really a thing the way it is in the US. You cannot easily get everything; the shipping is slower, and a lot of the stuff we are used to buying just is not as accessible. That alone made a difference. Even when I wanted something, the inconvenience forced me to pause, and most of the time I realized I did not actually need it.

Physically removing myself from such a consumer-driven environment is what finally helped me with my shopping addiction. In the US, you do not realize how much you are being advertised to every single day. From the moment you wake up and scroll on Instagram or TikTok, to the moment you go to sleep, you are constantly being told you need something. The scary part is that these ads do not feel like ads anymore. They are disguised as routines, recommendations, and relatability. Your brain stops registering them as marketing and starts believing they are necessities.

Once I left the United States, that constant noise disappeared. My social media feeds were no longer targeted to Americans, so I stopped seeing product pushes and influencer content centered around buying things. It honestly felt like I was seeing what TikTok and Instagram used to be before influencing became everywhere. On top of that, I naturally used social media way less while I was away. I was actually living my life.

My grandma lives in a very old Mediterranean country with a strong sense of culture and community. Third spaces were everywhere, and they were either free or extremely cheap. I was outside all the time, enjoying things without needing to spend money. And even when I did spend money, it felt reasonable. A coffee was two dollars max, not eight or nine. That alone made me realize how much of the US lifestyle revolves around spending just to leave the house.

I think the combination of all of this is what finally pulled me out of the shopping addiction I had. For the first time, I was not constantly thinking about what I wanted to buy next or what was sitting in my wishlist. My mind felt quieter.

Another thing that helped more than I expected was that I arrived with two completely full suitcases and barely any extra space. So even if I saw something cute at a local market, I had to stop and ask myself if I even had room for it. Most of the time, the answer was no, and I would just continue on with my day and not think about it again.

I think 3 months was the perfect amount of time. It helped me build habits and routines that are not easily breakable. Now that I’m back in America, I’ve really stuck with that mindset I developed while I was away. It’s a lot harder, yes, still everything is being pushed on you through social media, no third spaces, etc., but I found how to handle that better whereas before I was weaker and gave in. Now it’s been 6 months, and I haven’t bought anything unnecessary. Just thought I’d share my experience of how I was able to achieve that.

Ps: I know getting up and leaving the country is a big luxury and not everyone can do it. I’m super grateful I have the ability and flexibility to do that with work. If you do as well, I highly suggest it, and if not, I encourage you to find ways that may mimic that, maybe trying out new hobbies, reducing social media time, or anything else you can find that distracts you from shopping.",38,1765723765.0,shoppingaddiction,6,0.94,False

Im just going to cut to the chase about all of this. My wife and I have been married a year. We were dating for three years before that.

My previous relationship was super toxic. Not just her, not just me, we were toxic for and to each other. I was doing a lot of heavy drinking at that time. When that relationship ended I vowed to work on my insecurities and jealousy and all around character flaws until i was ready to date again.

Along comes my new wife. When we first started dating she told me she posted nudes to the reddit communities. Since we really weren't anything serious, I told her I didnt see a problem with it, but im not sure its something I wanted out of a partner I would marry. I have no problem with people who want to do things like that. I don't kink shame, I don't judge people's sexual wants and orientation. I'm very ""you do you, and I'll do me, hopefully we can all be very happy.""

We get married just over a year ago. Me, her, three close friends, and a close friend to officiate. We both come from a broken home, so the big ceremony would come in a year (this last October) so we could get all the families together.

As our relationship got serious I told her I wasnt a huge fan of her posting her nudes all over the place, and if we were going to take this to the next level I wouldn't want her to keep it up. If she objected to it, to let me know we can talk about it. I didn't want to be toxic. I wanted to express how I felt and give her the opportunity to express how she felt. If she wanted to keep posting and me asking her to stop was a deal breaker, we could part ways amicably, no harm, no foul. She said she had already stopped posting. I had my suspicions, but in the interest of not being paranoid and respectful of her privacy, I trusted her.

A month after our second ceremony, I getnup to make coffee and breakfast before work. At the time she left a couple hours before I had to. Every once in a while my paranoia would cause me to search the web and see if she was still posting.

Well, she was. Here on reddit. Between the two accounts, 1400 posts. And that's not counting the posts of the same content to multiple platforms. And to make matters worse, she hooked up with three (that's what she tells me) different guys while we were planning our wedding. It happened pretty much all the way up to right before our wedding. She made content with them, though honestly it was only 5 seconds clips. She picked guys near by from reddit so it wouldn't be anyone I knew or would meet. One guy She hooked up with she kept in contact with for a while after hooking up with him, and met up with him again when she went to visit her family. He uses content of her to try and pick up more women on this site.

At the time I was working 50 hours a week saving up for a car, and split my time between our apartment and the farm my mom lives on because I'm partially her caretaker and I take care of the animals on top of working. Right before our wedding we both moved out to the farm. Early in our relationship I was a heavy drinker, but DUI number 2 was my bottom and I'm committed to my sobriety (16 months on the 18th).

I confronted her about all of this, and she said she had made a commitment to quit a month before I found the account because she started to feel like she was being loved by me again and her needs were getting met. I asked her why she didn't remove the account and she said she couldn't bear to look at it so she made no hurry since I didn't know about it. I believe she wanted to use it when it became convenient for her again.

She stuck by me through my drinking, which wasnt a great time for me, and she seems like she wants to change, and I love her, so I want to give her a chance. She gave me one, after all.

Should I give her a chance? We're keeping this a secret. Only my recovery counselor and her therapist know about what happened. I feel like since she told everyone about my drinking and the charges that went with it, we should tell at least someone what happened, why I dont want to go to see her family for the holidays because im still pretty heated about it.

What can I do about the guy posting content of her on reddit? I havent confronted him at her request because shes afraid he'll expose her. Would confronting him even accomplish anything? Would i be able to get him to stop using the videos? Should I just cut my losses, learn a lesson about red flags, and lawyer up? Im having a hard time not being suspicious of her actions these days. But when I try and catch her. She proves to me that shes not doing anything wrong, and Im just being paranoid. She says shes committed to this marriage and knows that she really hurt me and messed up. She wants forgiveness but understands I dont trust her. Am I foolish for thinking that we could make a solid run with our marriage, if my drinking and her infidelity both stay in the past?

This ended up being longer than I intended, my apologies. Any advice is appreciated. ",7,1765723589.0,survivinginfidelity,16,0.9,False

1pmfmrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poem/comments/1pmfmrd/dont_move/,Don’t Move,"You curled up beside me.

Coffee cups warming our hands            
as you chuckled at something I said.

You poured my cup.

Steam rising in slow spirals,                   
glowing where the sunlight cut                             
across the room.

You looked at me.

Your eyes soft and serious.

My chest tightened.

Then I remembered.

This couldn’t be.



You’d been gone for so long                   
and none of this was real.

I half-woke,                                                
just enough to know I was dreaming,     
yet still couldn’t find a single thing          
that felt out of place.

It was so nice to see you again.

I wanted to hold you tight,                       
to say                                                           
I love you                                                      
the way I never fully dared                       
while you were still here,                         
but I didn’t.

I feared the smallest motion                 
would scatter you                                     
and wake me too soon.

So I stayed quiet.

Watching you.

Drinking in the light on your face.

Trying to memorize the way it felt.

When I woke,                                             
your presence lingered                            
like the fading scent of coffee.

For a heartbeat                                          
I almost turned to ask you

1pmfm59,https://i.redd.it/t9ywmknrl67g1.jpeg,"In 2023, a murder and a kidnapping instigated an unprecedented wave of violence that rocked the United States","The following events occurred in the Fallen Kingdom Universe:

On April 13, 2023, Roman Orlov, a high-ranking operative of the international terrorist group known as “Perseus” was assassinated by a team of private military contractors from Shadow Company.

Shadow Company had been hired by a tech mogul named Jasper Rutledge to assassinate Orlov after evidence emerged that Orlov was involved in a series of corporate espionage cases against Jasper’s company.

One month later, Callie Rutledge, a young barista, a resident of Fall’s End, Montana, and Jasper’s daughter, was kidnapped after her shift at the Caribou Hill Coffee Shop ended. Her captor was Tolis Banoglou, a high-ranking operative of the Russia-based international terrorist and spy ring known as Perseus.

Unbeknownst to the kidnapper, his actions were witnessed by DedSec hacker Hannibal Rathbone, his friend Adam Rorke and Adam’s girlfriend Amber, both of whom were vacationing in Montana at the time, and a mysterious ex-US Army officer turned DedSec hacker going by the name “Bellerophon”.

Rathbone, Halford, Rorke and Bellerophon each pursued Tolis, with all four of them having recognized him; Bellerophon recognized Tolis from an earlier encounter with Perseus three years earlier while Rorke and company recognized Tolis as a dangerous criminal with a long criminal record.

Over the course of four weeks, Halford, Rorke and Bellerophon both launched their own investigations, intending to rescue Callie and uncover Perseus’ motives for kidnapping her.

Rathbone’s team was able to uncover evidence that Callie’s father Jasper was involved in a series of investigations into a terrorist organization named Perseus after the terrorist organization was discovered to be connected to a series of corporate espionage cases against Jasper’s company. Rorke theorized that Callie was targeted as revenge for Jasper’s investigation into Perseus, and that Tolis had been hired by Perseus to kidnap Callie.

Rathbone’s biggest breakthrough was after he interrogated a Perseus informant; the informant confirmed that Callie was targeted because of her father’s previous actions against Perseus, more specifically an assassination mission involving the PMC Shadow Company.

Bellerophon, meanwhile, embarked on a shocking campaign of violence against Perseus, launching a series of one-man raids against various Perseus outposts and safe houses in a bid to track down Tolis and take him down while also intending to rescue Callie.

Tolis, who apparently knew Bellerophon, attempted to murder Callie by burying her alive in a shallow grave before attempting to relocate.

Ultimately, Rathbone and company managed to reach Callie and rescue her after Rorke discovered said shallow grave completely by accident.

Within minutes of saving Callie, Rathbone and company witnessed Bellerophon storming Tolis’ safehouse, burning his place to the ground in the process.

Tolis attempted to kill Bellerophon, leading to a Mêlée à Trois involving Hannibal and his cohorts, Bellerophon, and Tolis and his minions.

During the fight, Bellerophon was able to grievously wound Tolis, who mistakenly believed Rorke and his cohorts were in league with Bellerophon. With his dying breath, Tolis swore that Perseus would seek revenge against both Bellerophon and Hannibal.

Callie was safely returned to her father. Out of gratitude, Jasper offered Hannibal a job at his company. He turned it down, citing “prior commitments.” Adam, however, accepted the job and became an intern.

We have consulted people we know and we have gotten some positive feedback and we would appreciate your honest inputs too. Please do give a read and let us know what you think! It is a long read but we believe it is worth a read!

***HYBRID***

In a Traffic control center in Berlin, Harsha (32), a pragmatic defense contractor and geopolitical architect, activates “Project: VEDHA”—a Quantum Decryption Engine capable of cracking any firewall on Earth in nanoseconds. To demonstrate its power to a shady board of investors, Harsha manufactures a silent yet calculated “accident.” He orchestrates a fatal crash for a local corrupt businessman by remotely overriding a self-driving car and manipulating traffic lights, arguing that “Chaos is the enemy; Control is the cure.” His rationale is pragmatic and cold: “Human Error” is the root of all war, and VEDHA will serve as a “Global Governor”—an impartial, emotionless machine that forces peace by controlling the levers of power. The system is capable of small scale operations such as the accident he just caused but it requires a biological “Dead Man’s Switch” to fully activate and perform larger scale operations such as controlling whole nations—a safety measure locked to the biometric neural patterns of its original architect, Indian RAW Agent Kabir (35).

Kabir is a suave, hyper-lethal operative for the Indian Intelligence Bureau’s “Shadow Wing.” In a sleek infiltration sequence in Lisbon, Kabir retrieves the biometric key (stored in a liquid-neural drive) from his laboratory but is spotted by Harsha’s mercenaries. After the ensuing chase, he is cornered in an unmanned area in the Port of Lisbon by Harsha’s “Erasure Squad.” Moments before being incinerated by a flamethrower (to prevent any DNA traces), he injects his consciousness and the encrypted key into a prototype bone-conduction drive and throws it onto a cargo container bound for India.

The scene then cuts sharply from the sterile cold of Europe to the sensory explosion of the Kasimedu Fishing Harbor at sunrise. The screen fills with the chaos of the morning auction—the deafening roar of diesel trawlers, the slap of wet fish on concrete, and the neon-orange tangle of nets. We meet Shiva (30), not on land, but mid-air, leaping between rocking boats in a high-octane foot chase. He is pursuing a rival gang member who stole the day’s catch from an elderly widow. Shiva moves with the reckless grace of a man born on the waves, using anchor chains as swing-lines and sliding under swinging crates of ice. He corners the thief on a slippery pier, subduing him not with a punch, but by expertly casting a heavy weighted net to entrap him, earning a roar of approval from the local fishermen.

The victory is short-lived. As Shiva hands the recovered money back to the widow, a sleek, black SUV cuts through the crowd, silencing the cheers. Enter Raja, the sector’s ruthless loan shark. The interaction reveals Shiva’s desperate reality: he isn’t a hero; he is a tenant in his own life. Shiva hands over his entire share of the morning’s earnings just to cover the interest on a massive loan taken by his late father. Raja sneers, pointing toward the shoreline where Shiva’s ancestral home stands—a crumbling but majestic Chettinad-style house that looks out of place amidst the tin sheds. “The soil is worth more than the bricks, Shiva,” Raja warns. “Miss next week’s payment, and I turn your grandfather’s legacy into a parking lot.”

Shiva walks home, the weight of the threat crushing his shoulders, but stops to wash his face and put on a smile before entering the courtyard. Here, the noise of the harbor fades. We see Seetha (23), his younger sister, painting the peeling walls of the house. She asks if he paid the “bad man.” Shiva lies with exaggerated confidence that the debt is almost cleared and that he’s saving for her art school fees. As he watches her innocently return to her painting, the camera lingers on Shiva’s eyes—the desperation is palpable. He isn’t fighting for a building; he is fighting for the only sanctuary his sister has left in a brutal world.

One day, Shiva discovers the device on the boat of one of his friends, who happens to be a pirate. When asked about the device, the pirate tells him that he looted it off a European Cargo Ship but has no idea what the device is. Shiva thinks it’s a high-end hearing aid or Bluetooth earpiece worth a lot of money. He takes it back home and puts it on. The device’s needles micro-inject into his skull.

The device is activated, initiating the “Neural Residency.” This isn’t just a voice in his head; it’s a “Tactical Overlay” hallucination where Kabir appears as a hologram. When Kabir’s tuxedo-clad avatar appears in Shiva’s vision, Shiva doesn’t think “Sci-Fi”; he thinks “Muni/Kanchana.” Convinced he is haunted by a “foreign ghost,” Shiva drags himself to a local, fraudulent exorcist. While the exorcist beats Shiva with neem branches to “drive out the spirit,” Kabir (visible only to Shiva) stands in the corner, calmly analyzing the exorcist’s fake props and diagnosing the man with a calcium deficiency based on his posture. The humor escalates as Kabir’s “Tactical Overlay” begins critiquing Shiva’s lifestyle. When Shiva goes to eat roadside pani puri, the HUD flashes massive red warnings: BIOHAZARD DETECTED: CHOLERA IMMINENT. Shiva ignores it, leading to a bickering match with “the air” in the middle of the street, making bystanders think he has lost his mind. The “Odd Couple” dynamic is cemented in the bathroom, where Shiva demands privacy, and Kabir, unable to “turn off” his visual feed, politely turns his virtual back but critiques the lack of hygiene in the restroom, driving Shiva to a breaking point of frustration.

Shiva tries to block out Kabir by talking loudly to himself and pacing relentlessly, refusing to focus on the hologram or the voice in his head. Kabir attempts to warn him of the gravity of the situation and the imminent danger, but his efforts are in vain. Desperate and frustrated, Shiva begins banging his head against the wall until he bleeds and collapses. Fearing further harm, Kabir reluctantly withdraws, ceasing his attempts to reach him.

In London, Harsha’s AI (VEDHA) detects the login attempt. It cannot pinpoint the exact street immediately because the signal is bouncing off Chennai’s chaotic, dense infrastructure. However, VEDHA triangulates the signal to North Chennai, Grid Sector 4 (The Harbor). Harsha immediately deploys The Silencer, a deadly mercenary clad as the Plague Doctor, who is already stationed in the region as a contingency.

The Silencer arrives in North Chennai with a Haptic Frequency Scanner (a handheld device looking like a tactical phone). The chip in Shiva’s head isn’t just transmitting GPS; it is syncing with his biology. The chip emits a digital pulse every time Shiva’s heart beats.

The Silencer moves through the streets with his henchmen. When he gets closer to Shiva, the scanner vibrates more intensely. He is literally tracking Shiva’s heartbeat amidst the electronic noise of the city.

Simultaneously, relieved that Kabir has finally vanished from his vision, Shiva heads to his local tea shop, smiling as he meets his friends and enjoys a warm cup of tea. Just then, The Silencer manages to track Shiva down to the tea shop and slashes him with a Katana but Shiva narrowly misses the hit. A confused and petrified Shiva tries to evade him and run, but Kabir realizes running is illogical. When Shiva’s heart rate hits 180 BPM (panic), the chip’s “Survival Protocol” engages. Kabir overrides Shiva’s motor cortex. The audience sees the HUD interface: ADRENALINE: 180 BPM > MOTOR CONTROL: KABIR.

The camera snaps into “First Person View” (HUD style). We see target markers on the enemies. Shiva’s body executes a sequence of lethal Krav Maga moves that Shiva doesn’t know. Shiva is screaming apologies to the goons—“Sorry, brother! I don’t know why I’m hitting you!”— while he snaps a neck, disarms a gunman, and shoots three people with terrifying accuracy. Realizing that Shiva is more dangerous than he appears, The Silencer silently retreats from the scene. After the fight, his adrenaline drops and Shiva regains control. He looks at his shaking hands, terrified. He doesn’t know how to shoot a gun, yet he just headshot three men. Kabir appears in a mirror reflection and says, “We need to talk.”

Shiva heads back home and as he rushes through the front door, his hand instinctively raises to touch the garlanded photo of his father, but his hand stops mid-air, hovers for a split second before he touches the picture and prays to his father.

Kabir lays out the full reality, revealing the details of his mission and why Harsha is after him. In the flashback, we learn that Harsha was once his assistant while working on the chip—a mild-mannered, principled man. But when a corrupt superior tried to sell the project to an enemy nation, Harsha acted to protect the country, safeguarding the project. In retaliation, the enemy nation’s mercenaries killed Harsha’s family.

The government couldn’t help him seek justice: the project was classified, and targeting the enemy would expose it. Meanwhile, the corrupt superior escaped unscathed, even framing Harsha and getting him removed from the project, fearing he might expose him. Harsha spent four months in jail before Kabir bailed him out.

It was then that Harsha went rogue. Disillusioned, he concluded that mankind could never truly deliver justice without succumbing to emotion and power. Losing all faith in the system, he resolved to take justice into his own hands—on his own terms.

He also warns Shiva that The Silencer will relentlessly hunt them until the chip is recovered. Shiva reluctantly comes to understand that the only way out of this situation is to help Kabir take down Harsha. Just then, Raja, the loan shark who lent Shiva the money, calls him with a chilling ultimatum: he has kidnapped Seetha, and if Shiva wants his sister alive, he must repay the full amount within two hours.

Shiva and Kabir begin plotting a rescue mission to save Seetha from Raja. The rescue mission highlights their friction: Kabir plans a stealth approach using thermal imaging, but overcome with rage and desperation to save Seetha, Shiva throws caution aside, crashes a lorry through the wall of Raja’s house, and unleashes a brutal assault on him and his goons, proving that sometimes “Madras Rage” beats “London Logic.”

After securing Seetha in a safe house, Shiva promises to return to her soon and that he has some urgent work to tend to. While sharing a brief quiet moment, Shiva hands Seetha a cup of coffee and says, ""Here, an extra spoon of sugar, just how you like it,"" causing Seetha to frown and reply, ""Anna, I’ve always only taken one spoon of sugar... I don't take extra sugar."" Shiva apologises for the mix-up and says that he messed it up in a haste. Kabir tells Shiva that they depart for London to meet with Agent Zoya immediately and thus Shiva leaves for London. The journey from Chennai to London takes place aboard a rusting cargo freighter, as flying commercial would be too risky.

INTERVAL

In London, the plot deepens with the introduction of Zoya (29), Kabir’s former lover and partner, who believes Kabir is a traitor. Although Kabir was the original architect of the system, Harsha has revoked all of Kabir’s digital credentials, as he is officially deceased. If Kabir tries to hack the Harsha network using his old codes, the system will instantly flag the login as a “Ghost Event” and trigger a lockdown. Therefore, Kabir turns to Zoya who possesses “Legacy Access” as she was his former partner. (Legacy Access refers to backdoor clearance codes that Harsha hasn’t found or deleted yet) They need her specific login credentials to even get near the firewall without setting off alarms.

The meeting takes place in a safe house—a derelict clocksmith’s workshop in East London, filled with ticking noise. Zoya, now a rogue agent living off the grid, has Shiva at gunpoint once he enters. To her, Shiva is an intruder or a mercenary sent by Harsha. Shiva tries to explain his situation in broken English and panic, waving his hands and shouting, “Chip! Head! Kabir!”, but he sounds insane. Zoya tightens her finger on the trigger, convinced this is a trap.

With seconds to spare, Kabir commands Shiva to surrender control. The transformation is terrifyingly physical: the frantic, hunch-shouldered desperation of the Chennai street-fighter evaporates, replaced instantly by a cold, weary stillness. Shiva’s head tilts with a microscopic familiarity that freezes Zoya in place. When he speaks, it isn’t Shiva’s panic, but Kabir’s soft, accented Russian: “You’re aiming three inches left, Zoe. You always pull left when you’re tired.” The critique hits her like a physical blow. He steps into the gun, recounting a private memory of rain in Paris, whispering, “I took the bullet so you wouldn’t have to.” Zoya, trembling, lowers the weapon and reaches out to touch the face of a stranger, momentarily reunited with the dead. But the intimacy is brutally severed; the “Overwrite” warning spikes, forcing a violent disconnect. Shiva gasps, slumping back into his confused, local persona, asking in Tamil, “Did she shoot?” Zoya recoils, left staring at a man who looks nothing like her lover, realizing with devastating clarity that Kabir is just a ghost in the machine.

Kabir then explains the situation to her and she agrees to help them. They begin the “Symbiosis Training” for Shiva. The sequence begins with physical comedy as Kabir attempts to overwrite Shiva’s “Madras muscle memory.” Shiva’s natural gait is a loose-limbed, shoulder-swinging swagger—a “mass walk” designed to intimidate locals. Kabir, projecting a digital “Green Line” via the Augmented Reality (AR) overlay, forces Shiva to walk a tightrope of sophistication. Every time Shiva’s shoulder dips or his stride widens into a strut, Kabir blasts a jarring “ERROR” buzzer in his ears. The friction peaks during the “Dining Drill”. Shiva, who believes food lacks “soul” unless eaten with his hands, is forced to navigate the geometry of a knife and fork. Kabir treats the cutlery like weapons, explaining the tactile precision required to cut a steak without making a sound against the plate. Shiva fails repeatedly, sending a potato flying across the room, leading to a heated argument where Shiva yells at the air, “If I can kill a man with a tea glass, why does it matter how I hold a spoon?”

The training shifts from physical to cerebral over the next few days. Kabir introduces the concept of ""Micro-Expression Suppression."" He explains that VEDHA (Silas’s AI) does not listen to words; it reads the involuntary twitch of the Levator muscle in the upper lip or the dilation of pupils—signals of fear or deceit that occur in 1/25th of a second. To counter this, Kabir initiates the ""Mirror Drill."" Shiva stands before a bathroom mirror while Kabir projects a ""Bio-metric Grid"" over Shiva’s reflection. The goal is to endure a psychological interrogation without triggering a red alert on the grid. Kabir (the voice) begins to ruthlessly provoke Shiva, insulting his intelligence, his poverty, and mocking his inability to protect his sister, Seetha.

Initially, Shiva fails miserably. Every time Kabir mentions Seetha, Shiva’s nostrils flare in anger, and the AR grid flashes ""DETECTED."" Kabir warns him, ""In the server room, that flare gets you executed."" To survive, Kabir teaches Shiva the ""Dissociation Technique""—the art of separating the face from the feeling. He instructs Shiva to focus on a mundane memory—the sound of the ceiling fan in his old house—while his mouth speaks lies. The sequence culminates in a tense moment where Shiva finally cracks the code. Kabir insults him viciously, but Shiva’s face remains a mask of polite, stony indifference. The AR grid stays green. Shiva has learned to lie not just with his words, but with his biology. He hasn't become a spy; he has become an actor, capable of burying his rage under a layer of ice, a skill that transforms him from a street brawler into a lethal infiltrator ready for London.

But upon passing the test, Shiva suddenly loses consciousness and blacks out. Zoya revives him and examines the key, only to make a grim discovery. The Quantum Key is expanding in Shiva’s brain. Every time Shiva sleeps or lets Kabir take control, the chip deletes ""non-essential data"" to create space; his memories are being deleted. Shiva understands, with growing dread, that forgetting how to touch his father’s photograph and how Seetha likes her coffee isn’t random—it’s his memories slowly slipping away. The next day, Shiva wakes up realizing he cannot remember the chorus of his favorite song, cementing the tragic cost of his heroism: he is fighting to save a world he is slowly forgetting. The trio realise that they have to act fast and that Kabir cannot take control of him too often as it poses a risk of losing Shiva entirely.

To destroy VEDHA, the trio must infiltrate ""The Blackbox,"" Harsha's subterranean server farm. This plays out as a dense, three-stage heist. First, Shiva needs to infiltrate a high-society auction using social engineering to steal a retina scan from Harsha's snobbish Art-Collector CFO, Scott. Kabir’s tactical plan involves a silent entry through the ventilation shafts to deploy a drone, but Shiva rejects it, arguing that ""in Chennai, if you want to steal, you walk in the front door like you own the place."" Clad in a tuxedo paired with jarringly bright aviators, Shiva crashes the gala posing as an eccentric crypto-billionaire from South India. While Kabir feeds Shiva technical data about the paintings to sound sophisticated, Shiva ignores him and instead uses ""Mass"" psychology: he loudly insults the CFO’s taste, calling the million-dollar centerpiece ""garbage."" The insult baits Scott’s ego perfectly. Shiva claims to possess a ""rare red diamond"" (actually a polished shard of a brake light he found in the alley) and challenges Scott to appraise it. He hands Scott a specialized jeweler's loupe—which Zoya has rigged with a high-speed retinal scanner. As the arrogant CFO leans in, squinting into the lens to mock the fake gem, the device silently maps his eye. Shiva retrieves the ""diamond,"" delivers a nonsensical but profound-sounding punchline in Tamil about ""true value,"" and vanishes into the crowd before Scott realizes he has been played, leaving Kabir stunned that pure confidence outmaneuvered a million dollars of security.

Next, the duo faces the ""Aero-Static Corridor,"" a security tunnel lined with thermal lasers and air-displacement sensors so sensitive that even the heave of a chest breathing can trigger the alarm. Kabir projects the ""Safe Path"" via the HUD—a complex, gymnastic route requiring flips and contortions that Shiva’s heavy, brawler physique physically cannot perform. However, Kabir calculates a problem: even if he pilots the body, Shiva’s panic-induced heart rate and rapid breathing will trip the air sensors. This is where Shiva takes charge. He closes his eyes, mentally transporting himself back to the deep, silent waters of the Bay of Bengal where he spent years free-diving to untangle fishing nets. He initiates a ""Breath-Hold"" technique (Apnea), forcing his heart rate to drop to a near-comatose rhythm. With Shiva’s lungs turned to stone and his mind in a meditative ""Zero-Oxygen"" state, Kabir takes control of the limbs. The sequence is a mesmerizing, silent ballet: Kabir executes impossible mid-air twists and spinal contortions to slip through the laser webs, while Shiva provides the superhuman endurance to hold the position without a single molecule of air escaping his lips. They glide through the death trap not as a spy or a thug, but as a single, breathless organism, clearing the grid seconds before Shiva finally gasps, collapsing on the other side.

The final obstacle is the ""Kinetic Hall,"" a fifty-foot corridor lined with floor-embedded pressure sensors and lateral cameras designed to identify personnel by the unique ""skeletal rhythm"" of their walk. Shiva’s natural, heavy-footed ""Madras slouch"" triggers an immediate lockdown warning. Kabir calculates the biometrics required to mimic the CFO’s stiff, aristocratic strut but delivers a devastating prognosis: the ""Simulation Drive"" requires massive RAM, and the only available space lies in Shiva’s core memory sector. Shiva, staring at the sealed blast door, whispers, ""Take it."" As Kabir seizes control, forcing Shiva’s hips and spine into an unnatural, precise cadence, the tragedy plays out in the HUD. Shiva fights to focus on his sister’s face, repeating her name—Seetha, Seetha, Seetha—like a mantra. But as the hallway lights turn green signaling ""ACCESS GRANTED,"" the neural overwrite completes. The syllables dissolve into static. Shiva steps through the door, physically triumphant but mentally hollowed, turning to Zoya with wide, panicked eyes to whisper, ""I know she is my sister... but I don't know what to call her."" Zoya tells him that his sister’s name is Seetha and calms him down.

They breach the Central Core, expecting banks of humming servers, but are met with a chilling, sterile silence. The room is empty save for a single monitor displaying a live feed of the Chennai tea shop where Shiva was first hunted. Harsha's voice booms over the intercom, revealing the heist was never a secret; he anticipated Zoya’s ""Legacy Access"" and used the security protocols as a funnel to deliver the Biometric Key directly to him. Before the realization can fully settle, the shadows in the rafters detach themselves. The Silencer drops behind Zoya with the silence of a spider. In one fluid, brutal motion, he shatters her kneecap with a telescopic baton, dropping the trained agent before she can even raise her weapon. Shiva, disoriented by the fresh memory purge and the sudden violence, tries to brawl, but The Silencer anticipates his lunges. He deploys a high-voltage neural net that locks Shiva’s muscles in agonizing paralysis, leaving the hero helpless on the floor, staring at his fallen ally as the extraction team moves in. 

Harsha reveals his masterstroke: VEDHA is already active as during the tea stall brawl, The Silencer managed to seize a small fragment of the device that had broken off and that Harsha had enough power to control Tamil Nadu’s power grid. He threatens to shut off hospital incubators all over Chennai unless Kabir unlocks the key. Harsha straps Shiva into a ""Neural Separator"" to forcefully extract the data and Kabir’s consciousness, a process that will leave Shiva lobotomized. The battle moves to a surreal ""Mind Palace""—a crumbling version of Chennai where Shiva fights shadow monsters while his memories dissolve into pixels. Kabir, witnessing Shiva’s struggle to hold onto the fading memory of his sister, realizes that ""Logic"" would surrender, but ""Love"" fights.

Kabir makes the ultimate sacrifice, overriding the extraction process to initiate a ""System Purge."" He tells Shiva, ""The world has enough spies; it needs a brother,"" and uploads a virus attached to his own consciousness, deleting himself to burn VEDHA from the inside. Shiva wakes up as the servers fry, but Harsha unleashes his final defense: ""Haptic-Sync Droids,"" biomechanical super-soldiers that predict martial arts moves. The droids initially dominate, countering Kabir’s textbook style. However, Shiva enters a ""Hybrid State."" He utilizes Kabir’s reflex speed but fights with his own chaotic, dirty street tactics—biting, using wires to strangle, and throwing debris. The droids’ HUDs flash ERROR: PATTERN UNKNOWN as they fail to compute his improvisation. 

The final boss fight sees Shiva brawling with The Silencer and Harsha in the collapsing server room. After a long and stylishly executed battle, he manages to overpower and knock them down. Shiva then smirks at them and says, “Even the perfect AI can’t match an imperfect human”, as he delivers the killing blow. Shiva rescues Zoya and escapes as the building falls. 

SCREEN FADES TO BLACK

SCREEN READS: FEW DAYS LATER

Shiva is back in Chennai and has paid off his debts and rebuilt his home using the money Zoya transferred him from Harsha’s account. He tears up when he hugs Seetha, realizing he remembers her and promises to never leave her side again. He then sheepishly checks a mirror, hoping to see his friend, but sees only his own reflection. This causes a great deal of disappointment to Shiva who realises that he misses his buddy. Dejected, he walks away when a cup falls from a table. Without looking, Shiva catches it with terrifying, robotic precision—a subtle confirmation that while the ghost is gone, the skills remain.

When I started talking to him, we were sharing some personal information here and there.

That really made me think about how much inequality there is in society.

It feels like it’s not economically possible for someone to stay poor and still survive.

I just bought a DeLonghi Magnifica Start ECAM22X.6Y - 22X.8Y and this is my first coffee machine ever, so I’m very new to all of this. I’ve followed the instructions and by mistake pressed a few wrong buttons along the way, but I think the machine is now set up and ready to go. 

What I’m struggling with now isn’t how to make coffee, but first understanding the real-life routine of using this machine day to day. I don’t mean the official guidelines, I mean how people actually use it if they make, say, 2–3 coffees per day.

For example:
	•	After you make coffee in the morning, do you clean anything right away? Or Do you just turn it off and let the automatic rinse do its thing?
	•	Is there anything you actually clean every day at the end of the day?
	•	What do you clean every few days or once a week, and do you remove and wash the brew unit often?
	•	What’s your “morning / evening” routine with it?

Basically, I’d love to hear from someone who uses it daily saying something like:

“I make coffee in the morning, then I do/clean X. At night I clean Y. Every couple of weeks I do Z.”

I’ve tried initiating plans, but my messages are left on read in the group with no follow-up. I’m hurt and unsure whether this is passive distancing or if I’m overthinking it.

Is this a sign to stop initiating?

Would you address this directly, or let it go?

I have a small group of close female friends (30s, single, working in the same academic field). I’ve known them for 5–6 years. We’ve always been the type of friends that casually suggests plans in the group chat and go on small trips, we’re quite open with eachother. 

Recently, I reached out again after a month of silence in our original groupchat to suggest meeting up… (We have a dinner scheduled in December in our larger group chat). Neither could, and I’ve been left on read since by all three. 

Thursday 1,5 week ago: 

Me: Would anyone like to hang out soon ♥️?”. 

Beth: I’m working overtime all weekend, but maybe I’ll need a break;)

Dana: I’m really busy, but perhaps a coffee on Sunday will work☕️

Claire: I can’t on Sunday unfortunately. Would be nice to do something next week. Perhaps a quiz night or something?☺️

Me (to Dana): Coffee on Sunday sounds really nice.

Me (to Beth): Let me know if you feel like having a break. 

Me to all: I’ve been in a bit of recovery mode last night, sorry for the delayed response. 

I agree let’s make a quiz happen, we’ve been talking about it for ages. I can check where it’s on. I might have plans Wednesday, but what about Tuesday or Thursday next week? There’s also the Christmas party on Friday (which we go to yearly), would anyone want to go together this year? 

After this, there were no replies.… we never had that coffee. 

I’m a bit sensitive bc of my break up and I feel a bit disappointed by these girls who I thought were close friends. I might also have misunderstood something or come across as too eager? Also I haven’t mentioned that I’m having a hard time. 

Being left on read is ruminating in my head on top of my other feelings.

Thanks a lot :)

Backstory this year: 

This spring, I entered a relationship, and after that I noticed the contact from them gradually decreased. I still tried to stay in touch by initiating plans, and keep the old dating topic flowing, but often received polite excuses. About 7 months later, I became single again,

Around that time, I also started focusing more intentionally on my own well-being — I began therapy, started practicing yoga, and spent time reflecting after the breakup. This helped me feel more grounded, but I’m wondering if this shift also changed the dynamic between us",1,1765722156.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I’m concerned that if I try the elimination diet, the pain will still be random and not actually correlate with foods that I eat often.

For lovers of the classic Gesha experience. Great roast but Idk if processing is worth the price even if it’s tasty. Very interesting how it brews though.

•	⁠

One of my Christmas gifts to myself this year was some Lost Origins beans. I definitely consider it an educational investments of a sorts since Gesha isn’t even my favorite bean.

I reached out prior and got some tips from SEY which centered around a low extraction yield brew.  They recommend V60. Wet WDT during bloom. 2 pulse pour and shoot for a total brew time of around 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

I started brewing it my normal way. 0.8.2 on the VS6. 1:18.5 ratio in an Origami S with Cafec abaca filters. Bloomed for 40s with about 3x weight in water. 2 pulses of the same amount then a 3rd tiny pulse. Drawdown was about 3:45.

This cup was probably the cleanest cup of coffee I’ve ever had. The flavors were clear and structured with a nice citrus and floral note that I love in Geshas. The cup was pretty sweet when compared to my normal cups. It seemed like the sweetness came effortlessly. This being a normal to high agitation recipe, there was body but it was still a tea-like experience just more like a mellow sheng puer than a white tea if you will.

My 2nd cup followed SEY’s recipe more closely. V60 w abaca filters. Same temp and grind. Bloomed the same but did only 2 pulses with a drip assist for low agitation. The drawdown time was actually around 2:30 as they said which I thought was crazy, since I never brew this fast.

Lots more clarity. Flavors toned down a bit compared to the Origami, but there was more acidity at the tip of the tongue. It was a delicate acidity and interestingly structured. Classic tea like body.

I did a final cup for this set grinded a little finer at 0.7.2 but the same V60 C.abaca set up. 1:18 ratio using 10g of beans.

30g 40s bloom. 1st pulse of 115g was with a drip assist. Last 40g of water were poured without a drip assist. Drawdown was almost identical to the previous one at around 2:30.

The last cup was a good middle ground. The acidity is the star of the show here creating a bright citrus and floral forward cup with a tea-like body. Slight sweetness.

The first cup was definitely my favorite. The sweetness and body isn’t what people look for in a Gesha, but it’s what I look for hahaha What stands out is how easy it was to get a tasty cup; the processing comes through here. I really don’t think I’ve had a cleaner cup with such effortless sweetness.

All in all, I don’t regret the purchase. The experience was interesting, and the beans gave me a nice feeling even, but I wouldn’t buy them again. A natural Gesha still sounds better to me albeit it’s tougher to get such a nice cup.

1pmf4sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sobermethod/comments/1pmf4sn/the_quiet_high_of_helping_others_anonymously/,The Quiet High of Helping Others Anonymously,"There’s a special kind of rush that nothing in my using days ever touched: doing something for another person in recovery when they don’t expect it at all.

* Slipping a $20 gas card into a jacket pocket
* DMing a guy at 2 a.m. who posted “I don’t think I can do this” with nothing more than “You already are. I’m up if you need me.”
* Dropping groceries on a single mom’s porch who’s white-knuckling her first week, no note, just gone before she opens the door.

No applause, no credit, no “look at Massimo the saint.” Just the act.

Every single time I do it, something inside me levels up. I don't have cravings any longer yet my problems shrink, and my sobriety feels even more bulletproof. It’s like topping off my own tank by giving someone else gas.

Science calls it “helper’s high.” I call it free, renewable rocket fuel for long-term recovery. The Stoics called it living according to Justice and human connection. Whatever the label, it works.

You don’t need money or grand gestures. A ride to someone without a car, a “you’ve got this” voice memo, paying for the coffee of the person behind you in line who looks like they’re on day three; tiny, anonymous, pure.

Try one this week. No announcement, no tag, no story. Just do it and feel what happens on the inside when nobody’s watching. Then come back and tell us (without naming names) how it felt. I guarantee your sobriety will feel a little taller.

I am interested in finding my soul mate who ever it could be. I live a quiet life at this moment in my little duplex all by my lonesome. Not much to do this time of year besides indulge in my sedentary hobbies like movie/tv show collecting, gaming, or reading. I do also have physical activities I do when I can like jogging or cycling. I need to get in better shape and have all ready adjusted my diet as of late hopefully I’ll be in shape in no time! 

My personality is someone of curiosity. I enjoy learning about anything and would love to learn about you too! I find being able to have someone who is curious like me naturally is nice. I am also a shy person to people I don’t see too often or to strangers but once you get to know I will talk about anything. I enjoy good deep conversations because it’s how I bond with people in general especially someone I have romantic interests in! I am also a very abled bodied independent person so I am not diagnosed with absolutely anything, have my own car, and disposable income. 

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects.

\\- fav color maroon

\\- am a movie guy with a home theater system (also love documentaries)

\\- my fav move is twister

\\- pepperoni is my fav topping on pizza

\\- coffee is the goat and so is unsweetened hot or ice tea sometimes with lemon

\\- I do like being outside when it’s warmer but not in July as much (too hot sometimes)

\\- Oreo ice cream/cookies and cream is the GOAT

I have been there for about 2 months and within this time have had some of the most wild experiences in my career. 

I have managed a variety of concepts over the last 15-20 years, from coffee shop/wine bar to fine dining Italian. Many of my previous experiences have been recognized by Forbes, Michelin, Banchet, etc. Through these experiences I have found anticipatory service, acknowledging flaws and correcting immediately lead to mitigation of 99% of problems.

Our restaurant has a beautiful design, gorgeous and massive chandelier in the middle of the bar with a wrap around stairwell. The ladies room has a powder room off to the side of the stalls that is straight up stunning. Which all looks and sounds great.

The issue is guest continuously disrupt service and disrespect staff. Come in order little to no food, take an 1-1.5 hours in the bathroom to take photos. Kill us with reviews and disrupt service when we try to set boundaries. 

I have tried to set up locations to compromise and provide guests with photo opportunities, explain with reason (restrooms are private spaces and to respect the privacy of other guests) and tried to come up with ways to prevent such chaos (one day literally 1/2 our guests were scattered throughout the space taking pictures, like 30-40 people shaking asses while their companions took them).

I am at a loss of how to change this. We get complaints from other guests that genuinely would like to enjoy a meal and use a restroom like normal.
