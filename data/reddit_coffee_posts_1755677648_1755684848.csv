Martin and John were there, but Ben was sick. I liked it! I appreciate that John, Martin, and Martin’s wife did their best having had to learn new parts that very day. The sketches were good to great. I especially loved the task rabbit/podcast one and the coffee shop sketch. Martin’s wife (Emily Wilson) was hilarious! The audience participants were a lot of fun too.

I was SUPER confused/annoyed that the bathrooms were straight up closed after the show. They had 2 staff members standing in front of the doors to the bathrooms. What the fuck?

They had black and light blue tshirts, black crew neck sweatshirts, and stickers for sale as merch. I got a light blue tshirt. It’s average quality but I had to get something to remember their early days!

The grab and go feature of the lounge is for me one of the best aspects and unfortunately the only aspect I was able to enjoy on this trip. With a 6:30 flight out of D gates your time is limited to take advantage of the lounge benefit but Capitol One had this in mind. I was able to promptly check in, move right to the coffee bar, get a cappuccino, with pastry, and retrieve a sandwich or two, as well as a drink, before leaving. I was then able to make it to my D gate in about 9 minutes via the people mover arriving before boarding.

Staff was friendly and engaging specifically asking where my flight was going and providing an estimated time it would take to get there from the lounge and, for me, recommending the people mover.

1mvamti,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvamti,Graph 46mm basket,"TL;DR
Graph: fuller body, rounded taste, bit gritty mouthfeel. 
IMS: Cleaner, little sharp edges in flavour, velvety smooth. 

Hi all!

A while ago I received my Kickstarter backed Graph 46mm filter basket. Here are some thoughts. 

Build quality - The basket is light but solid and it came with an excellent, heavy dosing ring. The tamper fits great and has a thick base plate. 

UX - The basket fits all my portafilter. The dosing ring however may by ever so slightly redesigned, because after dosing and WDT, there are some coffee grounds on the upper ring. After the shot there is a thick head of water on top of the puck, which is easily discarded into the drip trap before a not so clear removal of the puck. Left grounds however are quickly rinsed of when flushing/cleaning the group head. 

Taste - Now if the above wasn’t already subjective, this surely is. I compared the Graph to the (Baristapro) IMS 18gr basket. 
Coffee: Colombian castillo and caturra, natural process, roasted by Feierboun (Lux), medium roast. Grinder: Niche Zero. Recipe: 20 in, 35 out, 25 sec. 
The first difference comes when dialing in: the Graph needs grind size 26 in the NZ, the IMS grind size 18. 
Cup: the coffees are hardly distinguishable, by which I mean the following differences are rather subtle. The Graph shot had a fuller body, a rounded flavour and had a bit of grittiness. The IMS shot on the other hand was cleaner, had a bit sharper edges in the flavour but a velvety smooth mouthfeel. 

I’m curious to hear if others have done side-to-side with this basket!",1,1755684318.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Eating out can be a delightful experience, but it can also make healthy eating a challenge. With tempting menus and large portions, sticking to your health goals might seem daunting. Fortunately, there are effective strategies for making healthier choices when dining at restaurants. By being mindful of what you order and taking a few key steps, you can enjoy your meal without compromising your health.

First, do your homework. Many restaurants provide their menus online. Before you go out, take a look at the menu to plan your meal. This not only helps you avoid spontaneous, less healthy choices but also allows you to find the healthiest options ahead of time. Knowing your choices in advance can help you stay on track.

### Choose Wisely with Starters

Starters can be the beginning of a healthy meal or the start of a calorie overload. Here are some tips for selecting your starters:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- **Skip Fried Foods:** Opt for grilled, baked, or steamed items instead of fried appetizers. This small change can reduce calories significantly.
- **Go for Greens:** Salads can be a healthy starter, but be cautious with heavy dressings. Choose vinaigrettes or ask for dressings on the side.
- **Share Plates:** If you're dining with others, consider sharing a few starters. This way, you can enjoy a variety without overindulging.

### Mind Your Portions

Portion sizes at restaurants are often larger than what you would typically eat at home. Here are some ways to manage portion sizes effectively:

- **Order Smaller Portions:** If available, choose smaller or appetizer-sized portions. Many restaurants now offer smaller plates.
- **Box Half:** Immediately box up half of your meal when it arrives. This helps prevent overeating and allows you to enjoy leftovers later.
- **Use a Side Plate:** If you're feeling tempted, try transferring your food to a smaller plate. This can trick your brain into thinking you have more food.

### Smart Main Course Choices

Your main dish often contains the bulk of your meal’s calories. Make informed decisions with these strategies:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- **Choose Lean Proteins:** Opt for grilled chicken, fish, or plant-based proteins instead of heavily sauced or fried meats.
- **Prioritize Vegetables:** Look for dishes that highlight vegetables. Stir-fried, roasted, or steamed veggies are great sides.
- **Don’t Fear Substitutions:** Don’t hesitate to ask if you can substitute a side dish for something healthier, like a salad or steamed vegetables.

### Be Smart with Drinks

Beverages can add unneeded calories and sugars to your meal. When ordering drinks, consider the following:

- **Water First:** Start with water or a low-calorie beverage. This can quell your thirst and help you make better food choices.
- **Avoid Sugary Drinks:** Skip sodas and fancy cocktails. They often contain hidden sugars that can derail your health goals.
- **Wine Wisely:** If you choose to drink wine, stick to a small glass. Red wine can have health benefits in moderation.

### Make Dessert a Treat

If you have a sweet tooth, there’s no need to skip dessert altogether. Instead, consider these options:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- **Communal Desserts:** Share a dessert with your dining companions. This way, you can satisfy your cravings while indulging less.
- **Opt for Fruit:** Many restaurants offer fruit-based desserts. These can satisfy your sweet tooth while being more nutritious.
- **Skip Dessert Altogether:** If you enjoyed a large meal, it might be better to skip dessert or ask for something simple like coffee.

Eating healthy at restaurants is not only possible but can also be enjoyable. By taking the time to strategize your menu choices and being mindful of portions, you can relish the dining experience without sacrificing your health. With these tips in mind, you can confidently navigate any restaurant menu and savor your meal while sticking to your well-being goals.

Understanding Nutritional Information: Decoding Restaurant Menus for Healthy Eating
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When dining out, it’s crucial to understand what you're eating, especially if you want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Restaurant menus can be overwhelming with all the choices available, but by learning how to decode nutritional information, you can make smarter meals. Here are some tips to guide you through the process.

First, familiarize yourself with common nutritional terms. Knowing what words like “calories,” “fat,” “carbohydrates,” and “protein” mean can help you make better decisions. Here’s a quick rundown:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- **Calories:** Represents the amount of energy you get from a food item.
- **Fat:** Essential for energy; however, aim for healthier fats like those from nuts and avocados.
- **Carbohydrates:** They provide energy, but focus on complex carbs found in whole grains and vegetables.
- **Protein:** Important for muscle repair and growth; opt for lean sources like chicken, fish, or beans.

Next, scan the menu for healthier options. Many restaurants now highlight healthier dishes or have sections dedicated to lighter choices. Look for these keywords:

- **Baked:** Instead of fried, baked options are usually lower in fat.
- **Grilled:** Grilled foods are often healthier as they don’t require added oil or fat.
- **Steamed:** This cooking method preserves nutrients and reduces added fats.
- **Fresh:** Items that are labeled as ""fresh"" may not be processed or loaded with preservatives.

Understanding portion sizes is another key factor. Restaurant servings can be much larger than what you might expect. Here are some ways to manage portion sizes:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- Share a dish with a friend; it’s a great way to try multiple items without overindulging.
- Ask for a smaller portion or a half-portion if available.
- Take half of your meal home for later, which can help prevent overeating at the moment.

Always pay attention to the dressings, sauces, and sides that come with your meal. They can add a significant amount of calories and unhealthy ingredients. Here’s how you can navigate them:

- Request dressings or sauces on the side so you can control how much you use.
- Opt for mustard or vinegar-based dressings, which are often lower in calories than creamy options.
- Choose fresh vegetables as sides instead of fries or bread, which add empty calories.

If you’re uncertain about the nutritional content of a dish, don’t hesitate to ask the staff for details. Many restaurants are happy to provide nutritional information or answer questions about how the food is prepared. Being proactive can greatly aid your decision-making process.

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
Another tip is to look up the restaurant’s menu online before you go. This will give you a chance to plan your meal in advance, allowing you to make a mindful choice rather than a hasty one. Plus, you can check if the restaurant provides nutritional information on their website.

Pairing your meal wisely can also make a difference. Instead of sugary drinks or high-calorie cocktails, consider choosing water or unsweetened iced tea. This simple swap can significantly cut down calorie intake while keeping you hydrated. Enjoying your drink of choice without the added sugar can enhance your overall dining experience.

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
Remember that indulging occasionally is part of a balanced approach to healthy eating. Don't be overly restrictive. Choose to delight in that rich dessert or savory dish once in a while, but remain mindful of portion sizes and frequency. The key is moderation.

By understanding nutritional information and applying these strategies, you can effectively navigate restaurant menus. This knowledge empowers you to enjoy dining out while sticking to your healthy eating goals. Keep these tips in mind on your next restaurant outing, and relish both the experience and the nourishment it brings.

### Conclusion

Eating healthy at restaurants doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By utilizing some key strategies and understanding how to decode restaurant menus, you can make nutritious choices that align with your health goals. Start by looking for menu options that feature whole foods, like vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Before you order, consider asking the server about how dishes are prepared or if substitutions are possible. This can often lead to healthier versions of your favorite meals.

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
Understanding nutritional information is equally important. Many restaurants now provide calories and other nutritional details either on their menus or online. Familiarize yourself with these stats, focusing on portion sizes and hidden ingredients that may undermine your healthy choices. Remember that just because something is labeled as ""light"" or ""healthy"" doesn’t mean it is.

Keep a balanced approach by combining dishes thoughtfully. For example, consider ordering a salad as a starter and sharing a main dish to keep portion sizes in check. Stay mindful of dressings, sauces, and sides, as these can add unnecessary calories.

Ultimately, healthy dining out is about making informed choices. By combining smart menu selections with a clear understanding of nutritional information, you can enjoy eating out while maintaining a balanced diet. With these strategies in your toolkit, you can savor each meal without compromising your health goals.

1mvaes4,https://youtu.be/V34n99FGSZU,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Fire Lookout Horror Stories,"# ""The Visitor"":

I started my season at the Athabasca lookout tower like any other year. I'd been doing this job for over a decade, spotting smoke from wildfires in the vast Alberta wilderness. The tower sat on a rocky hill, miles from the nearest road, with nothing but endless trees stretching out below. My routine was simple: wake early, scan the horizon with binoculars, log any changes, and radio in reports. I had my dog, Buddy, for company, and a small cabin at the base where I cooked meals and read books to pass the time.

One morning in late August, I boiled water for coffee on the stove and stepped out to the porch with my glasses still on the table inside. Buddy barked at something in the distance, but I saw nothing unusual—just the usual rustle of leaves. I called him back and went inside to grab my book. That's when I heard footsteps crunching on the gravel path leading up to the cabin. Heavy steps, deliberate, like someone not trying to hide.

""Hello?"" I called out, peering through the window. A man emerged from the tree line, tall and broad, wearing a faded jacket and boots caked in mud. He looked like a hiker, but his eyes were sharp, fixed on me in a way that made my skin prickle.

""Ma'am,"" he said, stopping a few feet from the porch. ""I'm lost. Been wandering these woods for days. Can I use your radio?""

I hesitated. We got the occasional lost person up here, but protocol was clear: help if possible, but keep distance. ""Sure,"" I replied, keeping my voice steady. ""Wait there. I'll bring it out.""

He nodded, but his gaze lingered on the cabin door. I grabbed the handheld radio from the shelf and stepped back out, handing it to him from the top step. ""Base, this is Athabasca lookout,"" he spoke into it after I showed him how. But he didn't say he was lost. Instead, he muttered something about a fire signal, then handed it back with a thin smile. ""Thanks. I'll be on my way.""

He turned and walked back toward the trees, but slower than before, like he was memorizing the path. Buddy growled low in his throat, hackles up. I watched until he vanished, then radioed base myself. ""Had a visitor,"" I told the dispatcher, Karen. ""Tall guy, said he was lost, but acted odd. Keep an eye out.""

Karen's voice crackled back. ""Copy that, Steph. You're remote out there—lock up tight tonight. We've had reports of poachers in the area.""

Poachers. That explained the unease in my gut. I shook it off and climbed the tower stairs for my afternoon scan. From up high, the forest looked peaceful, but I couldn't stop glancing at the tree line where he'd disappeared.

That evening, as I cooked supper, Buddy started barking again, frantic this time. I looked out the window and saw a shadow move between the trees—too big for a deer, too upright for a bear. ""Quiet, boy,"" I whispered, grabbing my flashlight. I shone it out, but the beam caught only branches swaying. Maybe it was nothing. I bolted the door and ate quickly, my book open but unread.

Night fell hard in the wilderness. I lay in bed, listening to the wind, but then came a soft scrape outside, like boots on wood. Buddy whimpered and pressed against me. I sat up, heart racing, and grabbed the rifle I kept loaded by the bed. ""Who's there?"" I shouted.

No answer. I crept to the window, peering through the crack in the curtains. The porch was empty, but something glinted on the railing—a knife, stuck point-first into the wood. My breath caught. It hadn't been there earlier.

I radioed base again. ""Karen, it's Steph. Someone's out here. Left a knife on my porch.""

Her response came quick. ""Stay inside. We'll send a team at first light—too dark to travel now. You armed?""

""Yes,"" I said, gripping the rifle tighter. ""But hurry.""

The hours dragged. I sat in the chair, rifle across my lap, Buddy at my feet. Every creak of the cabin sounded like footsteps. Then, around midnight, the door handle jiggled. Slow at first, then harder, rattling the lock.

""Go away!"" I yelled, aiming at the door. Buddy barked wildly.

A voice came from outside, muffled but clear—the same man from earlier. ""Open up, ma'am. I need help again. Got hurt in the woods.""

I didn't move. ""Help's coming in the morning. Leave now.""

He laughed, low and rough. ""Morning's far off. You alone up here? No one around for miles.""

The handle stopped jiggling, but I heard him circle the cabin, boots scraping the walls. He tapped on the window glass. ""I see you in there. Reading your book? Nice dog you got.""

How did he know about the book? He must have looked in earlier. I backed away, finger on the trigger. ""I have a gun. I'll use it.""

Silence. Then a thud against the wall, like he leaned on it. ""Just wanted to talk. Been watching these towers for weeks. Yours is the nicest.""

Watching? My mind raced—poachers didn't watch; they took what they wanted quick. This felt personal, like he enjoyed the fear.

He kept talking, his voice circling. ""Heard stories about folks disappearing out here. One old lady last year, gone without a trace. You remind me of her.""

I clenched my jaw, not responding. Buddy growled, but I shushed him. Minutes passed, then hours. The tapping stopped, and I dared to hope he'd left.

At dawn, I radioed again. ""Karen, he's gone, I think. But send help fast.""

""Team's en route,"" she said. ""Hang in there.""

I waited, rifle ready. When the rangers arrived—two men in a truck—I stepped out, showing them the knife. ""He was here all night,"" I explained. ""Tall guy, same one from yesterday.""

They searched the area, finding footprints leading into the trees, and a small camp hidden nearby with food wrappers and a sleeping bag. ""Looks like he's been squatting,"" one ranger said, named Tom. ""We'll track him. You did right staying put.""

""But he knew things,"" I said. ""Like he spied on me.""

Tom nodded grimly. ""We've had transients before. Some get fixated. You're not the first lookout to deal with this.""

They stayed while I packed essentials, insisting I come down to town for a few days. As we drove away, I glanced back at the tower, standing lone against the trees. Buddy whined in the seat beside me.

In town, the police questioned me. ""Description matches a drifter we've seen reports on,"" the officer said. ""Harasses remote workers. Slippery, though—never caught.""

I stayed in a motel that night, but sleep didn't come easy. Every noise outside made me jump. The next day, Tom radioed with an update. ""Found his camp abandoned. Fresh tracks heading north. We'll keep looking.""

I returned to the tower a week later, but it felt different—tainted. I scanned the horizon more for people than smoke. One afternoon, while up top, I spotted movement below: a figure slipping between trees, too far to see clearly, but the build matched.

I radioed base immediately. ""He's back. Saw him near the path.""

""Evacuating you now,"" Karen replied. ""Chopper's coming.""

As I hurried down the stairs, gathering my things, Buddy barked at the door. I froze—the handle jiggled again, in broad daylight.

""Open up,"" the voice said. ""We got unfinished business.""

I aimed the rifle. ""Help's coming. Leave!""

He pounded the door once, hard. ""You think they can get here in time?""

The wood groaned under his weight. I backed to the window, heart thumping. Buddy snarled, ready to lunge.

Then, the distant whir of helicopter blades. The pounding stopped. Through the window, I saw him bolt for the trees, jacket flapping.

The chopper landed, and rangers swarmed out. They chased his trail but lost it in the dense underbrush. ""Close call,"" Tom said later. ""Guy's dangerous—signs he planned to break in.""

They found tools in his abandoned gear: rope, duct tape. Enough to make my blood run cold.

I quit after that season. The wilderness I loved turned into a place of shadows, where isolation invited the wrong kind. Now, in town, I still lock every door at night, wondering if he's out there, watching another tower, waiting for his chance.





# ""The Real Fire"":

I had dreamed of this job for years. Being a fire lookout in a remote tower, high up in the mountains, watching over the forest. It sounded peaceful, a way to escape the noise of city life. In 2018, I finally got my chance at Gold Mountain in Washington. The tower was tall, the tallest live-in one in the state, with a small cabin at the top. I packed my bags, said goodbye to friends, and drove out there in late June. The season would run until October.

The first few weeks were great. I learned the routines: scanning the horizon for smoke, logging weather data, radioing in reports. The tower had basics—a bed, a stove, a radio. No running water, so I hiked down to a creek nearby for washing. The forest stretched out forever, green and quiet. I saw deer sometimes, birds flying by. Hikers were rare; the trail up was tough, miles of steep switchbacks. Most days, it was just me.

About three weeks in, I headed to the creek one afternoon. I carried my soap and a towel, planning a quick rinse. As I approached, I heard footsteps on the dry leaves. A man stepped out from the trees. He looked in his thirties, with a backpack and hiking boots, messy hair under a hat. ""Hello there,"" he said, smiling too wide. ""Didn't expect to see anyone out here.""

I nodded, keeping distance. ""Hi. Just doing my wash."" I hoped he'd move on.

He didn't. ""You the lookout up there? Must be lonely. All alone in that tower."" He asked my name—let's say I told him Abby, though I hesitated. Then more questions: How long was I staying? Did I have a gun? Was I scared of animals? I answered short, said I was fine, but he kept talking. ""A woman like you, out here by herself. Not safe. Bears, cougars... people too."" His eyes lingered. I felt uneasy, like he was testing me.

""I manage,"" I said, stepping back. ""I should get to it."" He finally left, heading down the trail. I waited until his footsteps faded before I washed. Back at the tower, I radioed the base station, described him. They said hikers pass through sometimes, but to report if he came back.

A few days passed without issue. I scanned the skies, read books, cooked simple meals. Then, one evening, I went to the creek again. Same time, same routine. Halfway through rinsing my hair, I heard branches snap. There he was, standing at the edge, watching. ""Abby, right? Thought I'd check on you. Make sure you're okay.""

My skin crawled. ""I'm fine. Please leave."" I grabbed my towel, backed away.

He stepped closer. ""You don't need to be rude. I'm just being nice. A girl alone needs protection."" His voice turned sharp. ""You think you're tough up there? I could show you real danger.""

""Go now,"" I said, louder. ""Or I radio for help."" He laughed, but turned and walked off. I rushed back to the tower, locked the door, heart racing. That night, I barely slept, listening to every wind gust, every creak of the tower.

The next morning, I radioed again. Gave his description—tall, dark hair, green jacket. Base said they'd alert rangers, but the area was big, hard to patrol. ""Stay vigilant,"" they told me. ""Keep the door locked.""

Days blurred. I stuck to the tower more, avoided the creek unless necessary. I started carrying a small knife on my belt, along with bear spray. The views that once calmed me now felt exposing, like eyes could be anywhere in those trees.

A week later, it happened. Middle of the night, pitch dark outside. I woke to footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow, deliberate clangs echoing up. At first, I thought wind, but no—too rhythmic. Someone climbing. I grabbed the bear spray and taser from under my pillow, crouched by the door. The steps stopped at the landing. A knock, soft at first, then harder.

""Who's there?"" I called, voice steady as I could make.

""It's me, Trent."" His voice, muffled through the door. ""Open up, Abby. You're not safe out here.""

How did he know my tower at night? I flicked on the light, saw his shadow under the door crack. ""Leave now! I'm calling rangers.""

He laughed, low and mean. ""They won't get here in time. You need to learn. All alone, acting like you don't need help. I'll teach you."" The door rattled as he pushed. I held the knob, but he shoved harder. ""Let me in!""

I sprayed bear mace under the door crack. He coughed, yelled in pain. Then I heard him stumble back. I radioed base, whispering urgent: ""Intruder at the tower. Man from before. Trying to break in.""

""Copy that. Rangers en route. Stay inside.""

Outside, he cursed, banged the railing. ""You'll regret this!"" Footsteps down the stairs, fading into the forest. I sat against the door, taser ready, until dawn. Every shadow outside seemed to move.

Rangers arrived by morning. They searched the area, found footprints leading away, but no sign of him. They took my statement, said he'd be charged if caught—trespassing, attempted assault. But weeks passed, no arrest. Base offered to pull me early, but I stayed. Stubborn, maybe. Or scared to admit defeat.

The rest of the season dragged. I jumped at every noise—a branch snap, an owl call. I rigged a bell on the stairs for warning. Washed at odd times, scanned the trails constantly. Once, from the tower, I spotted a figure far off, watching through binoculars. Gone when I looked again.

By October, I packed up, hiked out. Rangers met me at the base, said Trent had been spotted in town, questioned but released—no proof of the night visit beyond my word. ""Be careful,"" they said. ""He might hold a grudge.""

I left Washington, took a desk job back home. But even now, in the city, I lock doors tight, avoid being alone outside at night. That tower taught me peace comes with a price. And sometimes, the real fire isn't in the trees—it's the people hiding among them.





# ""Dead Air"":

I started my shift that summer like any other, climbing the metal stairs to my tower in the Alberta backcountry. The job suited me—quiet, just me and the binoculars scanning for smoke plumes across the endless green hills. I'd been at it for eight seasons, and the isolation never bothered me much. I had my books, my radio, and regular check-ins with the other lookouts. Stephanie was one of them, stationed about fifteen miles west in her own tower. She was older, tough as nails, with a voice that crackled over the airwaves like dry leaves. We'd talk every morning and evening, sharing sightings or just passing the time.

""John, you spot that haze over the ridge today?"" she'd ask, her tone steady and practical.

""Yeah, looked like dust from a logging crew. Nothing burning,"" I'd reply.

We kept it simple, but those chats made the long days bearable. Stephanie had been doing this longer than me, thirteen years straight. She knew every trail and creek in her sector. Lived alone in her cabin at the base of the tower, with just a dog named Rusty for company. She loved that mutt—always mentioned how he'd bark at deer or squirrels.

One afternoon in late July, her voice came through different. A bit sharper.

""John, saw a hiker today. Odd spot for one, way off the main paths.""

""Hiker? What'd he look like?"" I asked, adjusting my radio knob.

""Tall guy, dark jacket, backpack. He stopped and stared up at my tower for a good minute before moving on. Didn't wave or nothing.""

I shrugged it off at first. People wandered into restricted areas sometimes—hunters, lost tourists. ""Probably just exploring. Keep an eye out.""

But the next day, she mentioned him again. ""That same fellow's back. Camped maybe a mile down the valley. Saw his tent through the scopes.""

""You sure it's the same one?""

""Positive. Same jacket. Rusty's been uneasy, whining at the door.""

I felt a twinge then, but pushed it down. The wilderness played tricks—animals, echoes. Still, I told her, ""Report it to base if he gets closer. No sense taking chances.""

That evening, as the light faded, we talked longer. She described her day: boiled coffee on the stove, read a bit of her mystery novel, watched eagles circle. But her words trailed off. ""John, you ever get that feeling someone's out there, just beyond sight?""

""Sometimes,"" I admitted. ""But it's usually nothing.""

""Not this time. Rusty growled low all afternoon.""

We signed off, but sleep didn't come easy in my bunk. The tower creaked with the wind, and I kept picturing her alone in that cabin.

The following morning, her call woke me early. ""He's closer now. Saw him through the trees, heading my way. Didn't look lost—moved deliberate.""

""Stephanie, call it in. Get the rangers up there.""

""Already did. They're short-staffed, said it'll be tomorrow before anyone checks.""

I gripped the radio. ""Lock your doors. Keep Rusty inside.""

She laughed, but it sounded forced. ""I've got my rifle. Been handling myself out here longer than you've been breathing, kid.""

We chatted about lighter things—her grandkids back in town, my plans for fall hunting. But underneath, tension built. That afternoon, no check-in. I called her frequency. Static. Tried again. Nothing.

By evening, worry gnawed at me. Base confirmed they'd tried too—no answer. ""Probably radio trouble,"" they said. ""We'll send someone at dawn.""

Dawn felt too far. My tower overlooked her sector; through binoculars, I scanned the hills. No smoke, no movement. But something pulled at me. I couldn't just sit. I grabbed my pack, rifle, water, and started the hike. Fifteen miles over rough terrain—streams to ford, steep climbs. I'd make it by night if I pushed.

The trail wound through thick pines, roots tripping me every step. Birds called overhead, but no other sounds. Hours in, sweat soaked my shirt. I stopped at a creek to fill my canteen, ears straining. A branch snapped nearby. Deer? I waited, rifle ready. Nothing showed. Kept moving.

As the sun dipped low, shadows stretched across the path. I crested a ridge and spotted her tower in the distance, a thin spire against the hills. No lights in the cabin below. My legs burned, but I hurried down the slope, calling her name as I approached. ""Stephanie! It's John!""

Silence. The cabin door stood ajar. Rusty wasn't barking. I pushed inside, flashlight beam cutting the dim room. Table set for one, coffee pot on the stove, still warm. Her book open on the chair. But no Stephanie.

Then, outside on the porch, I saw it—a dark smear across the wood planks. Blood. Fresh enough to shine wet in the light. My mouth went dry. Footprints led from the porch into the grass, scuffed and uneven, like a struggle. I followed them a few yards, heart pounding hard. They vanished into the underbrush.

""Stephanie!"" I yelled again, voice echoing back empty.

Back in the cabin, I grabbed her radio—dead battery? No, it powered on fine. Why hadn't she called? I radioed base, words tumbling out. ""Blood on the porch. She's gone. Send help now.""

""Copy that, John. Stay put. Team's en route—ETA three hours.""

Three hours? In the dark? I paced the room, rifle in hand. The cabin felt too small, walls closing in. Rusty—where was the dog? I searched outside, beam sweeping the yard. In the bushes, a shape. Rusty, lying still, neck twisted wrong. Dead. Someone had killed him quiet.

Panic rose. Whoever did this might still be close. I barred the door, sat by the window, watching the trees. Minutes dragged. A rustle outside—wind? No, footsteps, soft on dirt. I peered out. A shadow moved between trunks, tall, dark jacket. The hiker.

He stepped into view, face hidden in shadow, but I saw the glint of a knife in his hand. Blood on the blade? He stared at the cabin, head tilted, like listening.

I ducked low, breath shallow. The door rattled—testing the lock. I aimed the rifle, finger on trigger. ""Who's there? I got a gun!""

No answer. The rattling stopped. Footsteps circled the cabin, slow, deliberate. A window creaked—him trying to pry it. I fired a warning shot through the glass. Shatter and echo. The footsteps retreated, fading into the woods.

I waited, sweat cold on my skin. Hours? Felt endless. Every snap, every leaf stir made me jump. Was he gone? Or waiting?

Finally, lights bobbed up the trail—rangers. They burst in, questions flying. I told them everything: the radio talks, the hiker, the blood, the shadow. They searched the area, found tracks leading north, but lost them in the rocks. No sign of Stephanie. No body. Just gone.

Days later, investigators pieced bits: a drifter seen in town weeks before, matching the description. History of violence, assaults on lone campers. But he vanished too. Case went cold.

I quit the job after that. Couldn't climb another tower, couldn't face the empty airwaves. Stephanie's voice still echoes in my head, those last words about feeling watched. Out there in the wild, it's not the fires that scare me anymore. It's the people who slip through the cracks, hunting in the quiet.





# ""The Knock"":

I started my shift at the remote fire tower like any other morning. Coffee in hand, binoculars ready, scanning the endless trees for smoke. The job suited me—quiet, away from crowds. I'd been up here in the mountains for weeks, reporting fires and keeping watch. That day, though, something felt off from the start.

Around noon, I spotted movement far below through the scope. A figure, a man, weaving through the brush. He carried a backpack, moved quick, like he didn't want to be seen. I noted it in the log: ""Unidentified hiker, northwest quadrant, possible trespasser."" We had rules about reporting strangers in restricted zones. I radioed base.

""This is Tower Seven, over,"" I said into the handset.

""Go ahead, Tower Seven,"" came the response from my supervisor, Tom. His voice crackled clear.

""Got a visual on a lone male, about two miles out. He's off the trails, heading east. No gear for camping, just a pack. Should I keep eyes on him?""

Tom paused. ""Yeah, monitor. We've had reports of poachers in the area. If he gets closer, let me know. Stay safe up there.""

""Roger that."" I hung up the radio and adjusted the binoculars. The man stopped, looked up toward the tower. Did he see me? My pulse quickened a bit, but I shook it off. Probably just a lost hunter.

By afternoon, he vanished into the trees. I scanned again, nothing. Focused on the horizon instead, checking for haze. Hours passed slow. I made a sandwich, ate while reading an old paperback. The tower creaked in the wind, but that was normal.

As evening came, I did my routine checks. Radioed in the all-clear. Tom signed off for the night. ""Call if anything pops up. Night shift's on standby.""

""Will do. Good night."" I set the radio down and boiled water for tea on the small stove. The cabin was cozy—one room with a bed, table, and windows all around for views. I liked the solitude, but tonight it pressed in.

Then, a knock at the door. Sharp, three times. I froze, mug in hand. No one came up here without radioing first. The access road was gated, miles long. I peered out the window. Darkness swallowed the stairs leading up.

""Hello?"" I called, voice steady as I could make.

No answer. Knock again, louder. My mind raced—animal? No, too deliberate. I grabbed the flashlight, shone it down. Empty platform.

I bolted the door, heart racing now. ""Who's there?"" I shouted.

Silence. Then footsteps on the metal stairs, climbing slow. Clang, clang. I backed up, grabbed the radio. ""Base, this is Tower Seven, emergency. Someone's at the door, unannounced.""

Static. No response. The line was dead? I tried again. Nothing. Panic rose. The footsteps stopped at the door. Handle rattled.

""Open up,"" a man's voice said, low and rough. ""Need help.""

""Who are you?"" I demanded, pressing against the far wall.

""Got lost. Hurt my leg. Let me in.""

I shone the light through the small window. His face—dirty, bearded, eyes hard. The same man from earlier. No limp that I could see.

""Can't do that. Protocol. I'll call for help."" But the radio wouldn't work. Jammed? Cut wire?

He banged the door. ""Open it now. Cold out here.""

I searched for something—a fire axe in the corner. Grabbed it, held tight. ""Go away! Help's coming.""

He laughed, short and mean. ""No one's coming. Saw you watching me today. Alone up here, right?""

How did he know? I swallowed hard. ""What do you want?""

""Food. Water. A place to rest."" But his tone said more. I remembered stories from training—poachers, fugitives using the woods to hide. One guy last year stole supplies from a tower, roughed up the lookout.

""Leave, or I'll defend myself,"" I said, axe raised.

He went quiet. Then glass shattered—one of the side windows. His arm reached in, unlocking the latch. I swung the axe, hit the frame. He yanked back, cursed under breath.

""You'll regret that,"" he growled.

I ran to the radio again, fiddled with wires. Sparks—someone tampered with it outside? When?

He kicked the door. Wood splintered. I barricaded with the table, pushed hard. ""Stop! Please!""

Door burst open. He stood there, tall, backpack slung off. Knife in hand, glinting. ""Should've opened when I asked.""

I swung the axe wild. He dodged, grabbed my arm. We struggled. He twisted, I dropped it. Pinned me against the wall. ""Quiet now.""

""Why?"" I gasped, fighting.

""Saw your truck. Nice spot to hide. Cops after me—stole some stuff down valley."" His breath hot on my face.

I kneed him hard. He grunted, loosened grip. I scrambled for the axe. Got it, swung low, hit his leg. He yelled, fell back.

Ran past him, down the stairs. Dark woods below. He chased, limping now. ""Come back!""

I hit the ground, sprinted into trees. Branches whipped my face. Heard him behind, crashing. Hid behind a boulder, breath ragged. He passed, cursing.

Minutes dragged. No sound. Crept back toward the tower? No, too risky. Headed downhill, toward the road. Knew a ranger station miles away.

But he circled back. Flash of his light. ""I see you!""

Dove into brush. Heart hammered. He prowled close. ""Can't run forever.""

I held still, dirt in mouth. He stopped feet away, breathing heavy. Knife scraped bark.

Radio crackled—from his pocket? He stole mine? ""Tower Seven, report.""

He mimicked my voice, bad. ""All clear.""

Tom: ""You sound off. Everything good?""

""Yeah, tired.""

Suspicious pause. ""Sending a team up. Hold tight.""

He smashed the radio. ""Now you've done it.""

Sirens faint in distance? No, imagination. He moved on. I waited endless minutes, then ran again.

Reached the road at dawn, flagged a passing truck. Driver, old logger: ""What happened, miss?""

""Man attacked me. Call police.""

They caught him later that day, hiding near the tower. Name was Victor, wanted for robbery, assault. Had stalked the area for days, targeted lookouts for supplies.

I quit after that. The isolation? Not worth it. Still wake up hearing those knocks.",1,1755683526.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1mvaasq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mvaasq/explore_if_nfftyuut_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Explore if NFFTYUUT Cold Brew Coffee Maker Delivers Quality in This Detailed Review,"The NFFTYUUT 1 Cold Brew Coffee Maker is a product I recently got my hands on, and believe me, I've been putting it through its paces. As someone who's borderline obsessed with iced coffee, this mason jar-style coffee maker immediately caught my attention. It's marketed as a durable, 64-ounce cold brew setup featuring a glass body, a handle, and a stainless steel filter. Sounds promising, right? While it lives up to a lot of the hype, there are certainly a few points worth noting for anyone considering adding this to their kitchen arsenal.  

**Aesthetic and Build Quality**  
I'm a sucker for anything with a clean and practical design, and this cold brew coffee maker didn't disappoint in that regard. The durable glass construction feels solid, and the black accents on the handle and lid lend it a sleek, modern touch. It’s just the right size—compact enough to fit in my slightly overcrowded fridge, yet capable of brewing coffee for several days. The stainless steel filter is the real star here, with its fine mesh preventing coffee grounds from sneaking into the batch. The handle makes pouring smooth and spill-free, a small but appreciated detail when my mornings are still groggy. However, the glass body does require a careful hand, as it’s definitely not shatterproof.  

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker keeps things simple, which is a relief if you're like me and don't have the patience for complicated setups. The manual process involves adding coarse coffee grounds to the stainless steel filter, filling the jar with water, and letting the magic happen in the fridge for 12-24 hours. No power cords or buttons—just a straightforward steeping process that's hands-off after the initial prep. Cleaning it afterward was thankfully uncomplicated, as long as you rinse everything out right away. I did, however, find that the narrow neck of the mason jar required a bottle brush for a thorough clean, which could be inconvenient for those short on dishwashing tools.  

**Highlights**  
- Durable glass container perfect for cold brew, lemonade, iced tea, or infused water.  
- Stainless steel filter effectively keeps coffee grounds contained.  
- Manual process eliminates the need for electricity and makes it eco-friendly.  
- Large 64-ounce capacity suitable for family use or coffee lovers who brew in batches.  

**Bad Points**  
In spite of all its positives, I noticed a few things that would give potential buyers a pause:  
- The glass jar requires extra care against drops or rough handling.  
- Narrow neck design makes cleaning slightly tricky without the right tools.  
- Filter handle feels a bit flimsy and might not last as long as the rest of the setup.  

**Competing Products**  
It's hard to pick a cold brew coffee maker without comparing it against other popular brands. For instance, Takeya makes a comparable cold brew maker that's plastic rather than glass, significantly reducing the risk of breakage. On the other hand, the plastic construction lacks the aesthetic appeal of this mason jar design. Oxo also offers an option with a more ergonomic focus but its bulkier design takes up more fridge space. Where this product shines is the balance of simplicity and capacity—it hits a sweet spot for those who want something fuss-free without compromising on volume or coffee quality.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When balancing this product against its price point, it's evident that it's an excellent blend of durability and practicality. Its manual design ensures it's going to last, provided you're careful with that glass body. Glass coffee makers tend to look more premium than their plastic counterparts, and this one is no exception. If you divide the cost over the number of lattes or iced coffees you'll avoid buying at a café, it starts to seem like a steal. For me, It’s already shaved off the cost of several pricey cold brews from my favorite coffee shop.  

[Hunting for NFFTYUUT 1 deals? Check Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c2btnzz3/)  

**Strengths**  
- High-quality build without reliance on plastic.  
- Minimalist design with a 64-ounce capacity ready to cater to a coffee-loving household.  
- Stainless steel filter produces mess-free cold brew every time.  

**Flaws**  
- Glass build does make it less travel-friendly or durable for heavy usage.  
- Cleaning the entire jar post-use requires extra effort for thorough results.  

Those considering an upgrade or replacement for their current cold brew system will find this product compelling. Its pros outweigh its flaws, and it works exceptionally well for those who appreciate a hands-off brewing process with a gorgeous mason jar aesthetic. If you treat it with care, it will likely become your go-to for not only cold coffee but other beverages like iced tea or homemade lemonade.

1mva8ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1mva8ly/how_to_learn_a_language_by_yourself_without/,How to learn a language by yourself without spending much money.,"Hey everyone! Friends of mine asked for advice on learning a language, so I wrote this up for them. I see the same question here a lot, so I’m sharing it with you. I hope it gives you some ideas, and feel free to criticize or add whatever you like. By the way, I wrote it in my native language and translated it with ChatGPT, so please excuse the em dashes.

I often see people asking how to learn a language in the shortest possible time. Besides having taught Spanish as a foreign language for almost two decades, I’ve learned several languages: French, Italian, Romanian, English, and Turkish. On my language journey I had seven years of English classes in public school that didn’t even get me as far as asking the time. Then I studied French, Italian, and Romanian at university for five years, but I never reached a satisfactory level of fluency. It was only when I learned Turkish to a fairly high level—without ever setting foot in a language class or taking a private lesson—that I understood what I’d been doing wrong for the previous fifteen years. I’ve always been passionate about this topic, and I’m about to finish a PhD on second-language acquisition. I’d like to share my experience and knowledge about how to learn languages, to save you years of suffering and thousands of euros in your learning process. Of course, I know everyone is different, and some people genuinely enjoy going to language classes (especially mine), so this method doesn’t have to work for everyone.

What do you need to speak a language?  
Although there are many theories about this, we can sum it up in four elements, which I’ve very loosely adapted from Paul Nation’s book, The Four Strands of a Language Course:  
— A sufficient level of vocabulary (no need to explain this one)  
— A basic understanding of grammatical rules (this is usually overrated)  
— Productive fluency (how easily you can produce utterances by combining the grammar and vocabulary you already know)  
— Receptive fluency (how easily you can process and understand utterances given that you can decode their vocabulary and grammar).

It’s worth noting that the two fluencies (does this word exist in plural?) are different because you can’t produce utterances with vocabulary you don’t know, but you can understand them from context.

Unfortunately, most language courses—or at least the twenty years of courses in five languages that I’ve attended—focus on an initial acquisition of vocabulary and an explanation of grammar, while skipping over fluency training and realistic strategies for retaining the vocabulary learned.

If that’s so, why do people go to language classes?  
People go to language classes to offload responsibility for their own learning. This may be because they don’t have enough knowledge to take charge of the process—just like going to a restaurant to have a dish you don’t know how to cook. It may also be because, in our capitalist minds, paying a certain amount of money equals getting the expected results without having to put in much effort, like those who sign up for a gym in January and don’t set foot in it all year. Many people also enjoy learning languages in a social environment, which is completely respectable—and, for a very long time, paid my bills.

So, how can I learn a language without taking a course?  
Let’s suppose you know nothing of a language.  
The first step in learning a language has to be learning words. A researcher whose name I’ve forgotten said something like, you can speak in a language without knowing grammar, but you can’t say anything if you don’t know any words.  
Etch this into your head: you have absolutely no business being in a language class if you don’t know a minimum of words. In fact, the first thing a teacher will do is teach you some words—most likely those for personal introductions—so the class can even start. Those words are in the first unit of any coursebook and you don’t need anyone to teach them to you. Also, unless you’re learning an extremely minority language, you’ll be able to find YouTube videos that teach them to you.  
And here’s where things get a bit crazy, because unless you do something, you’re going to forget everything.  
Ninety percent of what’s learned in class is forgotten before the last student has walked out the door and the teacher has rushed off to make a coffee. Hundreds of studies say this (including mine), but it’s an uncomfortable reality teachers prefer to ignore so they don’t have to take responsibility for students’ long-term learning.  
Therefore, the only option is to repeat and practice the words you’ve learned. That’s Ignacio’s first law: what you don’t practice, you forget. Thank God (sorry—thank science!) there are lots of techniques, programs, and mobile apps that help with memorization. The best of all—the unicorn—is Anki, a flashcard app. If you’re lucky, someone will already have prepared a deck at your level; if not, you’ll have to write them yourself as you learn new vocabulary. Every time you learn a new word and the demon of pride whispers that you don’t need to put it in Anki, remember Ignacio’s first rule and add it. If the language you’re learning is Chinese, you can use the HSK levels to learn in stages. If you’re learning English, Paul Nation’s own lists are quite good, and there’s a dedicated book, the General Service List. Unfortunately, very few languages have coherent vocabulary lists. Other repetition strategies include vocabulary notebooks, the Leitner card system, and Quizlet.

How many words do you need to know?  
To speak a language fluently, according to Paul Nation, you need to know about 3,000 word families. Five thousand is enough to start reading YA novels, around 7,000 to watch television, and about 15,000 to understand educated speakers when they’re being pedantic.  
However, my answer is that to speak a language fluently you only need… about 10 words!  
This is Ignacio’s second law for language learning: no matter your level, you can always speak, even if only a little. And whatever you say, you can do it fluently. Which brings us to the next topic… what is fluency and where can I buy some?

Fluency and how to acquire it  
As I said earlier, productive fluency is the ability to produce utterances with ease, comfort, and speed, using the lexical and grammatical resources you’ve already learned. Receptive fluency is the same but for receiving messages, although you can potentially understand words you don’t know through context.  
Theoretically (and in practice too!) it’s possible to be fluent from day one. You just have to practice a lot what you learn. Practicing a lot has an extra advantage: vocabulary practice counts as the spaced repetitions that keep you from forgetting what you learn. So if you’re practicing a specific set of content, besides increasing your fluency, you’ll be fixing your vocabulary in long-term memory and preventing forgetting.

How to achieve receptive fluency?  
The key to receptive fluency is listening to or reading content that is comprehensible for your level. This means that although there are some words you don’t understand, you can grasp the general and literal meaning of the text; in other words, you can infer the unknown words from context. For graded readings this means that between 95% and 98% of the vocabulary must be known, and this probably applies to listening materials too. That is, you need to read and listen to easy content, without trying to learn new vocabulary. Fluency is a jealous lover: when you practice fluency, you have to practice it—forget about learning (almost any) vocabulary, even if you incidentally pick up the odd word, especially if you ask what it means during a conversation.  
Now, this is obviously easier at intermediate and advanced levels than at beginner levels. How can I practice fluency at the start? Luckily, in the 21st century we have the help of thousands of volunteers on YouTube and other platforms creating comprehensible-input content. Here’s an example of how I would do it (and have done it): find low-level comprehensible-input content and use it first to learn the vocabulary. Write down all (all) the words used in the video and memorize them with Anki. You can do this by copying them directly from the video transcript. You can use ChatGPT to make you a list with the translated equivalent of each word, or do it by hand with a dictionary. When you’re confident you’ve memorized all the words, go back to the video and try to understand everything it says. The first time you won’t understand anything. Try turning on subtitles and reducing the speed. Once you manage to understand it, turn off the subtitles and increase the speed, making it progressively harder. When you can understand it all, find another video and repeat.  
To practice receptive fluency in its reading variant, you can do the same with adapted texts—if they exist in the language you’re learning—trying to read faster each time. However, I find reading less important, since you normally have all the time you want to read, but not to listen to what people say to you in the street.

How to achieve productive fluency?  
The only way to improve productive fluency is to produce utterances. Who would’ve thought! Of all the ways I’ve tried, there are two you can do on your own. The first is the famous drills of the audiolingual method. If you’re not familiar with this Spartan method—developed to teach languages to U.S. soldiers after World War II—let me explain. Teachers using this method had large classes repeat sentences in which they only had to change one or two elements. The goal was to repeat the same sentence hundreds of times until it was seared into the brain. This method works very well when your students are soldiers who can be sent to the brig if they skip your lesson, but it’s unbearable for anyone paying for a language class after eight hours in an office; hence it’s not widely used in today’s commercial educational settings. However, it does work for building productive fluency.  
How do you do an audiolingual drill? Write a simple sentence, like “I want to go to the train station,” and next to it a list of words that can replace one part of it, such as “the university,” “the bus stop,” “home,” etc. Then repeat the sentence, substituting “to the train station” with each of the words you’ve written. This works best if you have a partner who asks you, “Where do you want to go?” This is just one example of the exercises you can do—if you’re interested, look online. The public FSI books have lots of drill examples, though they’re quite dated (but they’re free!). You can also ask ChatGPT to create drill exercises and cross your fingers that it produces something consistent.  
A more modern-style drill could be to try talking about what you did during the day: first give yourself 5 minutes to speak, then 2 minutes, then 1 minute, reducing the speaking time while repeating the same task. The spirit of the exercise is the same: use what you already know, but faster each time.  
Another exercise to improve fluency is (brace yourself) talking to people. If you live in a country where the language is spoken, simply study a topic you can talk about with natives. For example, if you’ve just arrived, try to learn food expressions like “What’s your favorite?”, along with food names, or street directions. It doesn’t matter if you lie through your teeth or ignore people’s recommendations—the important thing is that sentences come out of your mouth. But be prepared, because in uncontrolled environments people tend to ask their own questions like “Where are you from?” and “What are you doing here?” or even “You’re not a spy, are you?” If you’re a bit lucky, you’ll make friends as well as practice the language.  
If you don’t live in the country where the language is spoken, try to find native speakers in your city (immigrants and tourists), or online (HelloTalk).  
Technically, we’re talking about practicing in controlled environments (drills) and progressing to free environments (the street). Your goal should always be the free environment. With drills alone you’ll never achieve sufficient fluency.

Private lessons? Groups?  
In my humble opinion, groups are very ineffective in terms of time invested versus gain provided. I say this as a student but also as a teacher of such groups… That said, I think both private lessons and groups offer a very good opportunity to create communicative situations in which to practice fluency. I don’t think class time is useful for anything else, especially for learning vocabulary (though I myself end up teaching vocabulary now and then, pressured by the syllabus).  
Classes are good insofar as you can use that specific context (talking with other students, talking with a native) to your advantage—usually to gain productive fluency. That’s why it’s important that a group class follow a strictly communicative method and that your classmates be willing to speak in the target language. If it’s a one-to-one teacher, it’s easier: you just have to ask them not to try to “teach” you things while you’re together—just to talk about topics you more or less master and let you practice what you’ve learned on your own (technically this would be a semi-controlled environment, halfway between drills and talking to people on the street).  
Of course, this assumes your vocabulary is growing outside class.

What about grammar?  
I don’t think there’s a language with a more difficult grammar than Turkish; if there is, I don’t know it. I never set foot in a class to learn it. Fortunately, the world is full of grammar books, and coursebooks are packed with grammar explanations, since writing about grammar is every self-respecting teacher’s hobby. Once you grasp grammar theoretically, using it falls under fluency. If you learn a grammar structure but aren’t going to use it, it’s useless. Learn grammar in exactly the same way you learn vocabulary: in order to use it in fluency activities.  
If you don’t understand something, you can ask a teacher, or ask in a learners’ forum, or any native speaker on the street. Just say a sentence and ask if it’s correct. By the way, that’s Ignacio’s third law: any speaker is a potential teacher.  
Grammar is extremely overrated.

What about pronunciation?  
In languages with very difficult phonetic systems—such as Chinese, or English (if you’re reading this and you’re a native speaker of English, let me tell you that your language has a phonetic system forged by Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom)—you’ll need to put in some work on pronunciation. However, pronunciation isn’t especially different from fluency, in the sense that the hard part isn’t pronouncing well—it’s pronouncing well and fast, especially in a real communication context. Practice it within your drills, just like you practice everything else.  
Beyond that, on my language journey I’ve realized that pronunciation—even when it’s truly atrocious—usually isn’t too big an obstacle to comprehension. Try to pay attention to it, and if someone doesn’t understand you, try to pronounce more slowly or use other words, without getting nervous. Nerves and embarrassment are the enemies of language learning.

That’s all—good luck on your learning journey. Let me just sum up everything I think:

1 — You can speak without grammar, but never without vocabulary. Vocabulary comes first.  
2 — Anki is your best friend. Repeat and practice.  
3 — Comprehensible input to practice receptive fluency.  
4 — Drills and repetitions to practice productive fluency.  
4 — Talk to people on the street. That’s what you’re learning for.  
5 — If you have friends or a teacher, talk to them. Don’t give them the chance to explain grammar or vocabulary to you. Don’t waste time.  
6 — Use books to learn grammar, and if you don’t understand, ask. But don’t forget grammar is overrated.",5,1755682891.0,ChineseLanguage,1,1.0,False

My mum has been vegetarian pretty much all her life ""for the animals"", and I was vegetarian basically until I was 16 because of her. I reverted to meat for a while, and she was severely disappointed in me, which is understandable. Now at 21, I reverted to being vegetarian for a bit because the guilt was getting to me and the meat wasn't all that good anyway. However, I sort of realized it didn't feel like I was doing enough, and so I watched Dominion and did some misc research. After that, I pretty much concluded that the egg & dairy industry is just as bad -- if not worse -- than the meat industry, thus driving me to become fully vegan.

Anyway, that's just some context. I've been vegan for almost a week now, and I've adjusted very well! It's forced my lazy ass to actually cook shit and plan what I'll eat for the day, instead of buying takeout or packaged foods. I can't see myself reverting to my old diet. I thought my mom would be ecstatic that I was taking this step towards animal justice, given how much she identifies with it, but I got a really odd reaction instead. She's a very much a 'bury my head in the sand' kind of person when it comes to animal abuse, so it was difficult to explain to her why consuming dairy and eggs were just as bad as eating meat. Even so, she did acknowledge that, even if she wouldn't let me talk about it in full detail, there must be something 'in it' so to speak to have turned me vegan. She's declared she will go... ""semi-vegan"". She's basically swapping to dairy-free milk when she can, and brought these eggs from this local farm where the chickens have a tonne of run room and are well looked-after. This is fine with me, and although it's not vegan at all, I'll still support whatever steps she takes towards the correct place.

Despite all this, she's starting to act really odd towards me. What's rubbing me the wrong way is that she's just trying to stop me from going all out. She keeps saying that I should eat the eggs she bought, because they're from 'happy chickens' and so it's therefore ethical. I actually couldn't format a counter-argument against this, because yeah, they are very happy chickens, but I don't want to be a 'conditional vegan' or whatever, so I declined it. She then said I should eat ""vegan"" at home and eat vegetarian while I'm out and about, like she intends to do. That I shouldn't give up my favourite hot chocolate sachets just because they have powdered dairy milk in them. Every convo we've had this past week has been her justifying this stance to herself, saying stuff like, ""oh, you have to be careful, I've seen vegans come into the emergency department REALLY sick"" and ""I could never go full vegan because of XYZ."" Just genuinely odd behavior from someone I thought would support my decision 100%. I think what really did it for me, though, was when I sent a vegan meal I cooked (cooking is very new for me, so I kind of just wanted to share it) into our family GC, and a couple of texts later she said, ""Eh, I've been pretty vegan without being a zealot"". Ngl it rubbed me the wrong way a bit, because you're either vegan or you're not lmao, and I wouldn't call myself a 'zealot' because I don't want to contribute to animal abuse. The 'veganism' she's referring to is swapping out dairy milk in her coffee for soy milk, which yeah, good for her, but can she please not try to make \*me\* feel weird about my choices? By the way, I know this situation is a lot more ideal than if my mom were a carni and mocking my decision, but I just feel a bit confused and hurt because I really thought we were on the same page, and her words seem very catty almost.

Anyways, yeah. I told my bf about this, and he says he reckons that I'm acting as a source of her guilt now, since she's always prided herself on 'doing the most' for the animals and now I'm doing more than her despite having strayed away at one point. I know this nagging won't stop and sadly, my mum has never really respected the boundaries I set when it comes to ""nagging"". I also live with my parents and rely on them for financial support while I study, btw. So yeah, guess I just wanted to vent, hear any similar stories, and maybe get some advice too.

Van Gogh sold very few paintings in his lifetime, yet today his work is everywhere: coffee mugs, aprons, posters. Most people buying them don’t know his struggles or how little recognition he had. That isn’t conceptual understanding. It is market saturation.

The same can be seen with band t-shirts. Many people wear them without knowing the music. Culture often works like that. Things are accepted socially and incrementally, not because they are deeply understood.

This is why “immersive Van Gogh” shows feel unnecessary. His paintings already have motion. They don’t need animation or projection. He did the work himself. He gave us his vision directly. Supplementation flattens what is already alive.

And Van Gogh’s case is not unique. The pattern repeats through history. Innovators are ridiculed or ignored, only to be “accepted” later — not because the majority suddenly grasps the depth, but because society shifts socially. The minority who understood early still understand, while the majority eventually goes along because others are doing so.

Cognography makes this pattern visible. All that is needed is to map the cognition of the individual and the majority cognition of the society they lived in. For Van Gogh, the estimate is clear: he painted through a **Conceptual / Sentient / Unscripted (CSU)** lens — visionary, empathetic, improvisational. His society at the time, late 19th-century Netherlands and France, leaned more toward **Empirical / Analytical / Scripted (EAS)** or **Measured / Pragmatic / Scripted (MPS)** worldviews. These coordinates are estimates, but they fit with the dominance of structured, conventional, and representational thinking in that era.

This clash — CSU against EAS/MPS — explains why his vision was misunderstood. The society around him valued rules and order, while he expressed turbulence, feeling, and unseen truths.

This is what Cognography offers: a way to model and simulate these mismatches. It may not be perfect, but it provides a framework to explore why recognition often lags behind innovation — and to see cognition not as hidden data, but as something that can be mapped and understood.

After a lot of self reflection, and ongoing therapy, I’ve decided I’m far from done. My problem is, I live in a small area where there is nowhere to go to meet people, and I mean nowhere, no bars (not that I’m a bar kinda person anymore) no coffee shops other than Dunkin and a Starbucks and nobody really stays there longer than to grab their order and go. 

I’ve tried looking into singles nights, the closest place is over an hour away, no local groups like book clubs or anything to that effect. Can’t find adult classes (like cooking or art or anything), volunteer groups around here are either court ordered community service, or bored married people trying to get away from their family for a few hours. 

I Checked out some of the websites that I’ve seen suggested on this sub, but again the closest stuff they list is an hour or more away, very little actually listed, and nothing that actually seems like somewhere you’d go as a single looking to meet people. 

I broke down and got on some apps, but wow. The ones that have people worth meeting charge way too much just to be able to talk to someone, I’ve tried them free and the lack of matches makes those prices even worse, or the people I have the most in common with are, 100 miles or more away, and I’m not looking to pay that much money to get shot down because of distance. FB is free but I’ve found 2 people within 100 miles that I was interested in just chatting with to see how it went (no response even though we matched). 

My standards aren’t even that high. At my age, in the shape I’m in (I’m dieting and losing weight, but I’m on the bigger side) I know I can’t be too picky, but I can’t find anyone that even seems like someone I’d be interested in. I even broke down and downloaded Tinder, which I swore I’d never do, but at this point I’d just like some kind of human interaction, even if it means being used for a night of fun (absolutely not what I want though). I’ll likely delete it by the end of the day though, cause I’m not really sure I’m actually okay with just hooking up at this point in my life. 

I love kids, I’d love to have kids. I love animals, dogs more than cats, but I love all animals. I’ve been into music my whole life, I’m a movie nerd, I get into binge watching tv shows, reading, cooking, camping, fishing, I like to travel but haven’t done much of it, there honestly isn’t a whole lot I don’t like to do or wouldn’t be willing to at least try. I’m outgoing but the solitude of being single for so long has kinda made me an introvert so without someone to do these things with, I just don’t do anything. If I could find a place at least somewhat local where there’s a healthy singles scene, I’d be putting myself out there. 

I’m 43, and haven’t had any real luck with women my entire life. My last “girlfriend” was a bit too young for me and totally wrecked me emotionally, I’m finally in a place where I’m ready to try again, but it seems like the whole world has moved on. 

So how do those that live in small areas, with nowhere to go and nothing going on find people?  Hell at this point I’d be willing to relocate, I don’t have the best job, but it is a good job and it’s a livable wage and I can honestly go anywhere and have a job with what I do. I’m just not quite ready to relocate my entire life just for a chance at meeting someone. ",2,1755682299.0,datingoverforty,2,0.75,False

# Background

So I've taken the plunge and moved to Thailand! Living the dream in Chiang Mai, but now comes the reality check - I need to figure out this whole remote work thing properly. I've got solid business management experience, but I'm quite new to the remote job hunting scene.

Thought I'd share my background and see if anyone has suggestions on where I should be looking or what I might be missing!

# Key Achievements & Metrics

**Multi-Enterprise Management:**

* Managed **multiple enterprises** with a combined retail portfolio worth **£6M+ annual turnover**
* **25%+ growth** in sales and operational efficiency across multiple locations
* Grew individual stores from startup to **£1M+ annual revenue**
* Maintained the **highest operational standards** across all managed sites

**Business Development & Scaling:**

* Launched and scaled a **coffee franchise** to become the network's top performer
* Generated **£30K+ weekly revenue** (£1.5M first year)
* Successfully implemented **new POS systems** during the beta phase with **zero downtime**
* Provided development feedback that influenced the final product rollout company-wide (400+ stores)

**Team Leadership & Development:**

* Built and trained **award-winning teams** from entry-level to management positions
* **6+ years** of coaching staff and developing future leaders

* Lots of experience in building processes and systems that actually work
* Data analytics and reporting - love a good spreadsheet and KPI dashboard
* 6+ years of team development from SA's to Management

**Tech Stuff:**

* **Obsessed with Notion** \- probably have more databases than I need (Currently building and selling templates)

* **10+ years dabbling** in video editing and graphic design on and off
* Bit of an **AI nerd** \- love figuring out workflows and automation stuff
* Getting pretty good at navigating Thai bureaucracy (useful skill in itself!)

# The Real Question

So here's where I need the community's wisdom - **where should I actually be looking?**

I've been browsing the usual suspects (Indeed, LinkedIn, Fiverr, Upwork etc.) but I feel like I'm missing something. Are there specific platforms that are better for remote roles? Communities I should be joining?

Also, anyone got experience with the **timezone advantage thing**? Being 6 hours ahead of the UK seems like it could be useful for some companies, but I'm not sure how to position that properly.

And finally - **any red flags to avoid** when applying for remote positions? I'm learning there's definitely some dodgy stuff out there mixed in with the legitimate opportunities.

Would massively appreciate any advice, platform recommendations, or even just ""here's what worked for me"" stories.

Is it just me, or does it feel like we’re living in some kind of magical era right now?

No code automation. Let’s talk about it. It blows my mind that what once took *weeks* of arcane scripting and frustrated coffee runs can now often be replaced by a few well-placed clicks and drags. Sometimes I stare at these no code tools and wonder, “Am I even qualified to feel this powerful?” 😂

Here are a few reasons I can’t help but be hyped about this movement:

- **Empowerment at Scale**: Remember when process automation meant the IT department’s backlog doubled? Now, the finance team, HR—*everyone* can spin up their own automated workflows without bugging devs every five minutes.
- **Creativity Unleashed**: We can stop burning energy on mindless copying and pasting. Instead, creativity blooms! All that repetitive effort? Gone. Suddenly, you’ve got time to imagine what *else* you could automate, iterate, or invent.
- **Learning Curve = Fun Curve**: Ever spent hours troubleshooting Python for your automation script to sync with your spreadsheet? No code platforms let you skip straight to the “Look what I built!” moment, which is SO much more satisfying.

A year ago, I would’ve bet money that anything more nuanced than scheduling emails or compiling reports was going to require some serious dev firepower. But now? Here’s what I’m seeing:

- Auto-generating invoices
- Creating workflows for onboarding
- Even managing social posts and analytics—integrated, tweaked, and controlled by *me*, no dev degree needed!

Every day, a new block, connector, or API plug-in shows up and my toolkit gets more superpowers. It’s starting to feel like Iron Man building a new suit—click, drag, deploy! 🚀

But here’s what might excite me the most: no code is democratizing technology. That whole “You need to know how to code to build cool stuff” trap? It’s vanishing. These tools are lowering barriers, enabling people to leapfrog into efficiency and creativity. Tiny teams are doing huge things; solo entrepreneurs are rivaling enterprise workflows!

I’d love to hear your stories!

- What was the first thing you automated with a no code tool?
- How’s it changing how your team works?
- Where do you think these platforms will be in 5 years?

Let’s share some joy and swap ideas—can’t wait to hear your automation wins! 🔥",1,1755682148.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False
1mva15d,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustedhousesitters/comments/1mva15d/separation_anxiety_or_just_needy/,Separation anxiety or just needy?,"Just a heads up: this basically me ranting to get this off of my chest, but advice would definitely be welcome!!

I've been petsitting for three years now. I took a three month break March-May to spend time with family, and then picked it up again. Rather than renting or buying somewhere, this is how I live.
Every sit I've done since June has had something wrong with it, and I haven't slept properly for months. It's driving me insane.

I've found that HOs favourite phrase is ""they've never done that before!!""
Peeing nonstop in the house when the carpets are already covered in stains, howling throughout the night when I've been told to shut them in a room they are obviously not used to, and yowling & biting and having my face constantly scratched are just some of the fun things that have triggered that sentence.
And it's the same with this sit.

I'm currently on a three week sit with a 2 yo cocker spaniel and a 11 yo jack russell.
My rule since my first year of sitting is no spaniels and no dogs under 3 yo. But I really needed a place to stay at early notice, and the sit had many good reviews.
I looked after a spaniel in my first year and it was an untrained covid dog and it pulled non stop on the lead and it nearly broke my wrist.
I also don't do younger dogs because I've been in loads of situations where I've had to train those dogs and I'm not here for that.

I work from home. I've made it very clear that my main intentions when I pet sit are that I'm looking for somewhere to work and go for walks.

But this cocker spaniel is driving me crazy. He needs almost near constant attention, to the point where I am working on my laptop and he will jump on me, headbutt me, stick his eye right next to mine. He pins me down, freezes against my body like he expects me to do something other than hug him, and then he will suddenly springboard off my chest. He's cut my lip and almost broken my laptop once.

Apart from that, he will sit on the floor and stare at me almost constantly. If he does settle down, the second I cough/sigh/sneeze or if I even change positions on the sofa he will be up and staring at me. 
If I am sitting at the table to work or eat, he will circle and circle and circle for an hour or two and just won't settle. If he decides he wants something like his ball or a treat, he will do the same thing. And he is relentless.

If I try to walk anywhere in the house he will walk directly in front of me and control the speed I walk and I think he's trying to control where I walk as well. He deliberately gets under my feet and I've almost stood on him and tripped over him a few times.

He's very well trained off the lead and has fantastic recall, but pulls so hard on the lead that my shoulder is now constantly sore and strained.

I was also told when I arrived that he's been peeing in the house in the mornings. Which I wasnt informed of when I applied, and this where I got the first ""he's never done this before"". The jack russell also barks consistently in the mornings until I let them out of their crates anywhere between 6:30 and 7:30am. Which they've also apparently never done before. If I try to go back to bed, the pair stand on the stairs and whine and bark (and you can guess what the owner said).

At first I thought it was separation anxiety and that the cocker spaniel would calm down after a few days. I've been here for 9 days and there's been no change in his behaviour.
I think he's just generally needy. He lives with a family of two adults and two older teenage boys and I think he's used to getting a range of attention which I cannot provide as a single person.

Also, both the cocker spaniel and the jack russell are OBSESSED with licking their privates. It's just hours of slurping and I keep trying to get them to stop, but it's crazy. And then they will jump on me and lick me. They look at me like they are upset with me when I tell them to stop or push them away. I thought they might have dietry problems so I messaged the owner, but this was also a ""they've never done this before"".

I don't want to encourage any of this behaviour. I need to work and I can't do it when I feel like I'm literally being stalked. 

My bigger issue is that I don't feel like this behaviour is enough to warrant leaving. It's bearable to a degree, except that I've been angry for the past week because the cocker spaniel won't settle for more than 30 mins. I have to stay very still and quiet when he has settled in case I set him off again.
One of the few ways I've found to get him to calm down is to walk them for 2-3 hours a day and just wear him out. But he's a young dog full of energy, so he's even more energetic when he wakes up.

It's also a small village so there's no coffee shops or a library where I could go and work.
There's buses but I don't want to travel for an hour a day just to work when I deliberately came to a house with high speed Internet so I could work inside and then go for walks with the dogs.

I don't know the best way to go about being in this situation because I'm getting so stressed. I'm here for 12 more days, but I'm having to work longer hours and I'm actually staying up later at night just to get some personal time because I don't feel like I can relax.


TL;DR: the dog is so anxious that it feels like it's stalking me nonstop in the house and I'm really stressed. What would you do in this situation?",3,1755682122.0,trustedhousesitters,4,0.8,False

1mva0us,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mva0us/explore_the_samsung_hafqinexp_refrigerator_water/,Explore the Samsung HAF-QIN/EXP Refrigerator Water Filter Review for Cleaner Water!,"**My Experience with the SAMSUNG HAF-QIN/EXP Refrigerator Water Filter**  

Sipping clean water straight from the fridge feels more like a necessity than a luxury, and I can confidently say the SAMSUNG HAF-QIN/EXP makes it possible. After spending months testing this refrigerator water filter, my household has seen consistent reliability with every glass. Whether it’s the quality of the water itself, ease of installation, or the longevity of the filter, this product has earned its place in our kitchen. That said, there are a few factors worth considering to know if it suits your specific needs.  

**Design and Build Quality**  

The first impression of the filter design was promising. Cylindrical yet compact—its structure is a perfect fit for Samsung refrigerators that require a square filter. Installing it in my RF28R6241SR model took less than five minutes. The fact that it’s lightweight (weighing just 8.96 ounces) further simplifies the process. Moreover, the material isn’t just durable but also features carbon block filtration, which enhances water purity. There’s something quite reassuring about it snapping into place snuggly without feeling flimsy. However, if your refrigerator uses a round filter, this is not compatible, so double-check its fit with your model before purchasing.

**Performance and Filtration**  

When it comes to water filtration, I wasn’t disappointed. This product claims to reduce 99% of harmful contaminants, and judging by how crisp and refreshing the water tastes, it lives up to these claims. The carbon block technology certainly works its magic, significantly reducing chlorine, sediments, and metals. I noticed a huge difference—not just in drinking water but also when using water for coffee or cooking. Testing it with filtered ice cubes was another win; no off-putting residue or bitter taste. While achieving this level of filtration is impressive, I’d recommend changing the filter every six months to ensure continued efficiency, as recommended by the manufacturer.  

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Maintains fresh-tasting water consistently.  
- Easy to install, even for those who aren't exactly handy around the house.  
- Fits snugly in appropriate Samsung refrigerator models.  
- Carbon block technology significantly reduces harmful contaminants.  
- No risk of water leaks or fridge damage when installed correctly.  

[Check SAMSUNG HAF-QIN/EXP pricing on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b071nfvvng/)

**Ease of Use and Installation**  

One of the features I appreciated most is how foolproof installation is. All it needed was a quick twist to remove the old filter and pop this one in. Knowing that it comes with an authentication tag makes an even bigger difference. I simply followed the authentication steps using the magnet provided, and seeing those green stripes confirmed it was a genuine Samsung filter. This feels like an important touch for consumers who prioritize authenticity to avoid aftermarket filters that could damage their appliance.  

**Considerations Before Buying**  

While the filter performs exceptionally, there are a couple of things worth mentioning. First, its compatibility is limited to Samsung refrigerators that require square filters. I’ve seen some reviews where users mistakenly bought it for non-compatible models, only to end up frustrated. Second, the 6-month lifespan means keeping track of replacements becomes another task on the to-do list, albeit a necessary one for safety. Finally, I do wish it came in a box with additional filters for those who prefer a bundled purchase.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Compatibility limited to certain Samsung refrigerator models.  
- Requires semi-regular replacements, which can be inconvenient.  
- Buying single packs could feel less cost-efficient compared to bundles.  

**Alternative Offerings**  

While this Samsung filter leads the pack in compatibility and performance for Samsung refrigerators, it isn’t the sole player on the field. The GE RPWFE filter, for instance, offers similar filtration quality but comes at a slightly higher price point. However, I’ve found that Samsung's dedication to compatibility helps it stand out—its filters are guaranteed not to cause water damage or leaks. Another competitor is EveryDrop by Whirlpool. It boasts excellent versatility, being compatible with multiple brands but in my experience, the water quality felt slightly less crisp compared to Samsung’s refined filtration. For Samsung fridge owners, I’d argue sticking with their official filter is the safest choice.  

**Money's Worth**  

When evaluating price-to-performance, this filter holds its own. Although the most cost-conscious buyers may flinch at purchasing the official brand filter over cheaper knockoffs, the peace of mind it offers is substantial. Multiple filters on the market may claim to fit a Samsung refrigerator but could lead to malfunctions or leaks in the long run. Given how well the SAMSUNG HAF-QIN/EXP preserves both water quality and appliance safety, it feels like a wise investment. The value is not just tied to clean drinking water but also protecting your pricey refrigerator from unnecessary repairs.

1mva03v,https://www.reddit.com/r/hairdressingscissors/comments/1mva03v/so_about_those_new_scissor_prices_lets_talk/,So About Those New Scissor Prices... Let's Talk Tariffs,"Was shopping for new cutting and texturizing shears last week and nearly choked on my coffee. My go-to Juntetsu Sword 6.5"" that was on sale for $350 last year? Now $410. The Joewell texturizer I had bookmarked? Jump from $280 to $379. 

At first I thought it was just inflation or companies being greedy, but then I noticed EVERY brand had similar increases. Japanese, German, doesnt matter. So I did some digging and... yeah, it's the tariffs.

**What's Actually Happening:**

So apparently we've got these tariff rates now:
- Japanese scissors: around 15% tariff
- German/EU scissors: 15-20% tariff  
- Chinese scissors: 30% for now (but was way higher!)
- Everything else: 10% baseline

I read somewhere we're at the highest tariff rates since before WW1. No wonder our tools cost more.

**Real Examples I'm Seeing:**

My usual scissor spots are being pretty transparent about it. JP Scissors literally has a [tariff update page](https://www.jpscissors.com/pages/u-s-japan-tarrifs-update-august-2025) explaining they've been eating costs since COVID but can't absorb these new tariffs. 

Hair Talk (the extension company) is adding a 10% surcharge but eating the rest of the cost. Some companies like Dame are literally adding a ""$5 Trump Tariff Surcharge"" at checkout with a little hair icon lol. At least their being honest about it.

**Price Changes I've Noticed:**

Japanese shears (what most of us use):
- Entry level ($150-350): up about $25-60
- Professional ($500-1200): up $75-200ish
- Premium handcrafted: forget about it

German shears are getting hit too. Standard Jaguar models up $30-130, premium lines easily $60-250 more. Its crazy.

**The Sketchy Part Nobody's Talking About:**

Ok this blew my mind - [most ""Japanese"" scissors sold in the U.S. are actually made in China](https://nagamakishears.com/best-japanese-shear-brands/country-of-origin-/). Only a small percentage are genuinely from Japan. Bunch of brands use Japanese names and ""Japanese steel"" marketing but manufacture in China. 

Check for ""MADE IN JAPAN"" stamped on the actual blade, not just the packaging. [According to industry sources](https://nagamakishears.com/best-japanese-shear-brands/country-of-origin-/), around 90% of scissors don't even have country of origin marked on them. Shady af.

**What Other Stylists/Barbers Are Seeing:**

Talked to a salon owner friend who said her extension costs basically doubled this year. She had to raise service prices across the board. Another barber said his supplier started warning about increases back in spring.

One wig specialist started doing ""tariff sales"" trying to bulk up inventory before prices go even higher. Smart move honestly.

[AWARE Hair has a good breakdown](https://awarehair.com/blogs/news/2025-haircare-tariffs-salon-product-impact) of how this affects everything from scissors to salon furniture. Its not just our shears getting hit.

Everything's going up - clippers and trimmers 10-15% more, blow dryers and hot tools have noticeable jumps, color products from Europe are way more expensive, extensions from Asia have brutal increases. Even U.S.-made stuff costs more because of packaging components.

**What This Means For Us:**

Basically we need to:
1. Budget for everything costing 15-25% more
2. Verify country of origin before buying (SO many fakes)
3. Maybe stock up soon - heard China tariffs might go way up again later this year
4. Consider being honest with clients about why prices need adjusting

[The Hair Society has some good strategies](https://www.thehairsociety.org/navigating-the-storm-strategies-for-hair-salons-facing-elevated-tariffs-on-chinese-imports/) for dealing with these increases if you're a salon owner.

Some companies are being really transparent which is nice. JP Scissors is working with suppliers to minimize impact. A few brands are eating partial costs. At least we know WHY prices are up instead of just random increases.

**My Take:**

Look, I get the politics behind tariffs are complicated. But as someone who needs quality tools to make a living, these increases hurt. Especially for new stylists trying to build their kit. That $400 starter set is now pushing $500+.

Planning to bite the bullet and order my new shears this week before any more increases. Also eyeing some backup pairs since who knows whats coming.

**Why I Posted This:**

Its my day off and I just noticed these price jumps today when shopping. Couldn't find much info about how tariffs are affecting our specific tools, so figured I'd share what I found in case anyone else stumbles across this and wonders why their favorite scissors suddenly cost way more.

Quickly learned margins matter:

\-⁠  ⁠Cost for 2 cookies worked out to ₹18 (ingredients + electricity + packing)  
\- ⁠Sold at ₹30 initially, nobody cared  
\- ⁠Made it “6 for ₹85” and suddenly people found it to be fair since marketing them as organic

Paired it with coffee → actual bundle upsell

Ended up breaking even on day one, profit on day two.

But the real value wasn’t the money I made, it was learning:

\-  ⁠Unit economics matter more when you’re sweating in real life. Suddenly you get why founders obsess about scalability  
\- Confidence sells more than the actual product sometimes

Till then I am confused should I keep buying pre ground and experimenting with it or save up the money to fasten up my savings for grinder .( I am not buying agaro one as I don't want to waste money in something that will not last). 

In terms of equipment I am thinking of buying a kaldipress as it's an cheaper version of aeropress and I think it's best for any beginner 

Do tell me If any of my assumption are flawed

I usually drink coffe 2x a day but when I'm in a flare like right now I'll stop, mostly because it's just not worth drinking 1/4 of a coffe I have to prepare lol

I just read that coffee/caffein can stimulate gastric emptying (just a few minutes faster than without, but hey, it's something!), but it seems like it varies from person to person and also depends on what you eat with it - smaller meals seem to be beneficial, but it can slow down motility with larger foods.

it seems like people on here are very different with tolerating coffee. so I'm wondering if stopping coffee during a flare is actually a bad idea for me? on bad, but still not-flare days, coffee is often the thing I can rely on. at the same time, it's also a rather nutrient empty meal for me, as I usually just eat some cookies or something with the coffee and have yet to find a protein powder that doesn't taste horrible in my coffee lol

so I'm thinking about starting to drink coffee again to see if it actually helps me a bit, but I'm worried it might set me back again. is here anybody who feels like they are worse off without coffee than with? could it actually help gastric emptying in gastroparesis?",2,1755681648.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False
1mv9vtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraCreditClub/comments/1mv9vtk/editing_writing_service_review_my_handson_take_on/,Editing writing service review: My hands-on take on LeoEssays for polishing drafts,"I went looking for an editing writing service that could take a serviceable draft and make it classroom-ready without steamrolling my voice. After testing a few options, I spent two weeks running my essays through LeoEssays - not to “ghostwrite” anything, but to tighten arguments, catch sneaky logic gaps, and clean up style. Below is a student-friendly rundown of what stood out, what didn’t, and whether this could be the best editing writing service for your needs.

https://preview.redd.it/4mzyhtuh65kf1.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=718706e9d4b165da68f04953afeae42e91e884a8

You can explore the site here: [https://leoessays.com/](https://leoessays.com/?utm_source=R254&utm_medium=reddit). And because Reddit loves clarity: LeoEssays (leoessays.com).

# Why I tried an editing-first approach

If your draft already exists, you don’t necessarily need a full rewrite - what you need is a sharp second brain. An editing writing service promises exactly that: structure, clarity, and consistency, plus line-level polish. I tested LeoEssays on three pieces:

* A 1,200-word analysis (dense with sources)
* A reflective piece (tone-sensitive)
* A short literature review (needs clean structure)

The goal: improve flow, thesis focus, and style while keeping the “me” intact. No template vibes, no generic language mats glued to my paragraphs.

# Ordering, scope, and deliverables

* **Project brief:** I outlined my audience, tone (concise, not stiff), and what *not* to touch (quotes, data points).
* **File handling:** I uploaded Google Docs and requested tracked changes.
* **Notes back:** They left comment bubbles where logic drifted or examples were thin, and suggested stronger paragraph openers.
* **Turnaround:** Each draft returned within the agreed window. (Let’s say this plainly: plan ahead; editors are not time-travelers.)

What I liked most is the editorial *dialogue*. Edits were specific (“split this long sentence; foreground the claim”), not vague. When I pushed back - “I want this paragraph to sound more conversational” - the revision stayed within my guardrails, which is exactly what a good editing service should do.

# Results you can feel (and measure)

I grade edits on three things:

1. **Clarity per paragraph** \- can I summarize each paragraph in one clear sentence?
2. **Reader guidance** \- do transitions create a smooth path without repeating the thesis ten times?
3. **Voice integrity** \- does it still sound like me, just…tidier?

After edits, my intros had stronger hooks, topic sentences did real work, and the conclusions landed without grand, movie-trailer final lines. The effect: cleaner logic and less fatigue for the reader.

# Quick comparison (what you get vs. self-editing)

|Item|Self-edit at 2 a.m.|With LeoEssays|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Structural fixes|Easy to miss gaps|Calls out missing steps and weak links|
|Sentence flow|Risk of over-editing|Tightens without flattening tone|
|References|You might skip cleanup|Flags inconsistent styles and stray details|
|Feedback style|“Feels fine?”|Targeted comments with concrete next steps|

>

# Pricing & scope control

Without quoting numbers (they change), I’ll say this: the sweet spot is when you already have a full draft. If you’re starting from bullet points, expect to pay for deeper involvement. If your budget is tight, target one high-impact section (intro + first body section) and mirror the changes across the rest-free compounding effect.

# What could be better

* **Interface wish list:** I’d love a progress meter that shows “structural pass done → line edit in progress → final check.”
* **Examples gallery:** More before/after snapshots on the site would help newcomers understand scope immediately.

Neither is a deal-breaker, but both would lower the learning curve for first-time users of a writing service online.

# Is it the best editing writing service?

Bold claim, so let’s split hairs:

* If you want wholesale content creation, this isn’t the crown you’re chasing.
* If your draft is decent and you want it to read like your best day-focused, coherent, and smooth - LeoEssays competes strongly for the best editing writing service slot in that lane.

I’ll put it this way: after my trial, I didn’t feel like I’d lost my voice; I felt like my voice had finally had its coffee.

# Tips to get more from any editor (steal these)

* **Be explicit about tone.** Include two sample paragraphs that sound “right.”
* **Prioritize your goals.** Rank what matters: thesis strength, paragraph order, or style.
* **Tell them what’s off-limits.** Quotes, stats, delicate framing - label them clearly.
* **Ask for tracked changes and margin notes.** You learn faster that way.
* **Schedule a buffer day.** You’ll want one extra pass after you get the edit back.

# Who it’s good for

* Students who can draft but want sharper structure.
* Non-native English speakers who already have strong ideas and need style smoothing.
* Anyone preparing statements of purpose or cover letters where tone control is everything.

If you’re thinking, “I need a writing service for me that won’t turn my essay into someone else’s,” this lane will make sense.

If you’ve got a real draft and realistic expectations, try a single-document edit first. Start here: [https://leoessays.com/](https://leoessays.com/?utm_source=R254&utm_medium=reddit). Or just remember the name - LeoEssays (leoessays.com) - and decide whether an editing writing service matches your current project.

**Questions for you:**

1. When you use an editor, do you want ruthless cuts or gentle nudges?
2. What’s your biggest pain point - structure, transitions, or sentence-level polish?

**TL;DR:** [LeoEssays](https://leoessays.com/?utm_source=R254&utm_medium=reddit) is well-suited to polishing drafts while keeping authorship intact. It won’t write your entire paper from scratch, and that’s the point. If you’re chasing tidy logic, consistent tone, and cleaner paragraphs, it’s a solid candidate for your shortlist of the best editing writing service options.

1mv9qco,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mv9qco,Lofoten Long Crossing – most adventurous thru-hike of our life (Reviev and tips),"**Lofoten Long Crossing – most adventurous thru-hike of our life**

After the Corfu Trail and the GR221, it was about time to level up our long-distance hiking game.  
My wife and I both had company holidays during the first two weeks of August, which seemed to be the perfect period for the Lofoten Long Crossing. 11 Stages, 15-18km every day, 500-+1000m change in elevation per day, extreme landscape.  
To get there, a bit of planning needed to be done – we took the train to the next airport, flew to Oslo, caught another plane to Bodø, stayed there for one night, and took the first ferry to Moskenes on the Lofoten archipelago the next morning.  
At 11:00, the ferry docked and we were ready to hike from south to north.

Our first five days were self-supported, which added 3.5 kg of food to our backpacks. We tried to stay as light as possible and really only took what seemed necessary (I used every single item in my backpack except the gloves – detailed list will follow).  
Backpacks weighed around 13–15 kg at most, but got lighter day by day. Luckily, you don’t need to bring a lot of water since it’s available everywhere.

The first day already made pretty clear that we were not supposed to underestimate what was ahead of us. We hadn’t expected the terrain to be as steep as it was in some sections (even as Austrians, used to big mountains). The trails are not marked and not well maintained (or not maintained at all) – it’s the perfect adventure.

Nevertheless, we quickly adapted to the difficulties of the trail, developed our trail legs and found our pace. There are stunning views literally around every corner. At first you can’t even comprehend what’s going on… spiky steep peaks, crystal-clear lakes, hardly any vegetation or wildlife at all – just plain rock, grass, bushes and moss.

We were lucky with the weather for the first two days, but unfortunately a bad weather period with rain and strong winds was about to start. After the 4th day of hiking we were forced to take two days off and pitched our tent at a campsite (Ramberg) because the rain was crazy and winds reached up to 70 km/h, which made it unsafe to continue.

After the break, we skipped the sections we had lost, because one of them required a lot of road walking anyway, so it wasn’t too bad.  
Back on the trail it still rained for a couple of hours per day, but we got used to it and also had sunny periods. *Embrace the wet* became our mantra.  
The rain also turned the trail into a boggy mess. Sometimes we were ankle-deep in mud for kilometre after kilometre… but still, you get used to it because everything else is so stunning, and by this point we had developed a huge sense of adventure.

We hiked for another three days, camped at the most beautiful locations, but also had to seek shelter from a storm in a small forest – otherwise our tent would have been ripped apart.  
Day 9 on trail brought heavy rain and winds again. At some point the trail turned into a little creek. We looked at each other and we both knew it was over. We hiked 10 km out to the next road and cell phone reception, booked an apartment on the shore, and hitchhiked 25 km into the next town, where we stayed 3 nights until it was time to get home.

 

* Were we disappointed not to finish? – Yes.
* Did we discuss our decision several times? – Yes.
* Was it the most adventurous thing we’ve ever done together? – 100%
* Would I recommend doing it? To each and everyone!

 

There is one thing you can’t control – and that’s the weather. Weather is king!

We are not regretting a single minute on the trail and it did something to us, I can´t fully name yet but it´s good!

 

 

**Tips for the Long Crossing:**

* Due to rainy, boggy and wet conditions I would **NOT** recommend trail runners. Boots were the better choice.
* Bring a water filter – even tho the water is clear, there is sheep poo everywhere.
* Real Turmat freeze-dried meals are really good, we tried them all. Try Rendeer Stew
* Use a pack liner – rain covers will NOT keep the inside of your backpack dry after several hours or days of rain.
* Keep your camp clothes as dry as possible and bring warm enough layers. Putting on the puffy at the end of the day felt amazing every single time.
* Talk to other hikers about the trail – we got plenty of useful information.
* Eat stockfish.
* Bring all your tent stakes and pitch your tent well – high winds can occur anytime.
* Eat a lot and bring sweets for mental support.
* Your rain jacket will not stay dry – embrace it.
* Norwegian people are really, really friendly. Ask and they will help you (for example, we were allowed to dry our tent in the basement of a campsite).
* Most ferries are free if you’re a pedestrian… and I love boat rides.
* Besides the popular trails there are not many people. Solitude is beautiful.
* Hiking poles were essential for us, especially on boggy terrain and descents.
* Plan more days than there are stages… rest days or forced breaks need to be taken into account.
* Hitchhike roadsections – we hitchhiked 4 times and every single time someone picked us up in less than 5 minutes.
* Avoid walking on the E10 or on bridges – it’s busy and not pleasant without a pedestrian walk.
* Stop and turn around every once in a while – the views change so quickly.
* Don’t get intimidated by other hikers who may be faster or handle difficult terrain better. It’s your hike, it’s your pace.
* There is a ferry from Svolvær to Skutvik and a fast boat to Bodø if you need to return from the northern part to the airport in Bodo.
* Make sure to visit the little café in Vindstad run by volunteers… real trail angels.
* Be kind to each other / your hiking partner – we both had a bad days eventually! Support is everything!
* Wind is your friend when it comes to drying your shoes and tent
* Clif Bars are the best
* Be careful when cooking after a long demanding day on the trail. Your concentration is low, I spilled my boiling water and in a desperate attempt to catch it, I burned a hole in my puffy
* Bring patches to fix your cloths
* Don’t trust the internet, not even me because for you the hike could be different as well.
* No bugs – zero mosquitos. Even tho one hiker told us about one stage where it was terrible.
* Put all your camp cloths and sleeping stuff (earplugs etc.) in the foot box of your sleeping bag, so you don´t have to gather everything together
* Use drybags
* No need for a headlamp in summer. It will not get completely dark
* Bring rain pants not just a rain jacket
* Norway is expensive
* Eat cloudberries – never tested anything close to it and they all along the trail, as well as blueberries.
* Aeropress makes good coffee and is not too heavy for the trail
* Keep your eyes open for sea eagles, they are beautiful
* A straight section of 2km on the map with no change in altitude can take you 2.5h (Forsfjord – Vindstad)
* Merino does the trick
* The MT100 Puffy Jacket from Decathlon is the best bang for your buck
* Prepare your own breakfast to safe money, get enough calories and something tasty in the morning (oatmeal, milkpowder, dried fruit, nuts, chocolate…)
* Switch your phone to flightmode – safes you battery and does not distract you from the beauty and the people around you
* Resupply is easily possible in Ramberg, Leknes and Svolvaer
* Get the reis app for public transport
* Get multiple weather forecast apps just to realize none of the is correct
* Make a lighterpack list even if you are not ultralight in any way, it just helps to get an overview and will help you to sort out. Lighter packs make a safer hike.

* Get a cheap and light foam mat. They are great for breaks, to put under your inflatable mat to give it some protection from the ground or just to lay out stuff on it and have a dry place. There is one from Decathlon that is 5€ and 150g.
* Make friends
* Have fun

1mv9puh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1mv9puh/reveal_the_truth_about_horsepower_bull_shot/,Reveal the Truth About Horsepower Bull Shot Carpet Cleaner,"Testing the Bull Shot Carpet Spot & Stain Remover by Horsepower has been an eye-opener for me. As someone who battles daily with an active household that includes kids, pets, and endless coffee spills, finding a cleaning solution that delivers is like striking gold. When I first heard about this product, I was skeptical – after all, there are countless cleaning sprays claiming the same ""miracle"" results. But after consistent use, I must admit, it's been a reliable ally in my fight against stubborn stains and pesky odors.

**Effortless Design and Application**  
One of the standout features is how simple it is to use. The hands-free ""point-and-spray"" approach has been transformative for someone like me, juggling household chores. I just aim, spray and let the product work its magic. Whether it’s fresh spills like juice or older coffee stains that have been haunting my carpets for weeks, the application process doesn’t demand much effort. There’s zero scrubbing fatigue unless it’s an older, stubborn stain that might need some brushing. 

[See Bull Shot Carpet Spot Cleaner deals on Amazon now.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b0d3r7f36s/)

**Advanced Stain-Lifting Technology**  
Incorporating its stain-lifting foam is a feature where the product truly shines. The foam penetrates deeply into carpet fibers, breaking down the source of the stain rather than just masking its appearance. My youngest daughter spilled grape juice on our light beige living room carpet last month, and trust me, I thought all was lost. Surprisingly, the foam not only eliminated the stain but also removed the sticky residue. The formula works on a range of stains – from lipstick messes on upholstery to that coffee I’m forever spilling while half-asleep in the morning.

**Odor Elimination Capabilities**  
A bonus I appreciated was its dual function as an odor eliminator. Beyond removing visible stains, it neutralizes odors effectively. We have two dogs at home, and accidents inevitably happen on carpets and upholstery. I’ve tried other products in the past, but while they cleaned, some left behind a synthetic or overpowering scent. Bull Shot, however, eradicates not just the stain but the smell entirely, leaving my home fresher without heavy fragrances.

**Safety Features for Families and Pets**  
With safety being a top priority for me as a parent and pet owner, I was relieved by the brand's promise: this stain remover is safe to use around kids and animals. I never once worried about harmful chemical residue on the carpet when my toddler decided she wanted to roll around immediately after I cleaned up a snack stain.

**Versatility Across Many Uses**  
Bull Shot isn’t limited to just carpets. I tested it on our older, cloth-upholstered couch, and to much delight, it lifted oil stains (left weeks earlier by someone snacking aggressively on chips – not naming names) with no damage to the fabric. It’s also handled kitchen grease, spilled red wine, and marker doodles that my son thought were ""creative art"" on the carpet. Its multipurpose functionality makes it invaluable for varied household mishaps.

**Merits**  
- Hands-free spray application makes cleanup quick and easy.  
- Effective for new and old stains, working impressively well across diverse messes like grease, coffee spills, and pet stains.  
- Dual action as a stain remover and odor eliminator ensures a refreshing finish.  
- Totally safe for kids and pets, reducing parental anxiety regarding chemical exposure.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- For some older, deeper-set stains, a second application might be necessary to fully clean.  
- The foam, while effective, can sometimes leave a slight residue if not wiped properly after use.  
- The spray nozzle could use a bit of tweaking to ensure precision and avoid minor drips while aiming.  

**Rival Brands in Comparison**  
Comparing Bull Shot to other carpet cleaners like the Bissell Spot & Stain Remover or Resolve Carpet Cleaner, there are some notable distinctions that make this product stand out. Resolve, for instance, does a great job lifting everyday grime but often falls short on neutralizing odors. On the other hand, the Bissell cleaner leans toward being a tad more expensive, although it integrates deeper carpet vacuuming features, which Bull Shot doesn’t offer. What makes this cleaner pull ahead, for me, is its ease of use, pet-safe formula, and dual-action foam.

**Quality for Price**  
While you’re likely to have many options for carpet sprays that market themselves as all-in-one solutions, this product genuinely justifies its price point based on performance and safety. It’s budget-friendly for households like mine, where spills are a daily occurrence. Unlike pricier alternatives where you’re paying for more branding than effectiveness, Bull Shot performs where it counts—maintaining a cleaner, fresher space without breaking the bank.

Over the years, I noticed how **Korean food plays a beautiful role in many dramas -** whether it’s the emotional comfort of a home-cooked meal, the hustle of running a restaurant, or just that one character who *always* seems to be eating.

Food in K-Dramas isn’t just there to make you hungry (though it *absolutely* will). It often plays a bigger role - connecting families, healing heartbreaks, starting friendships, or even sparking romantic sparks over a shared meal.

So I decided to compile a list of **popular K-dramas where Korean food isn’t just present - it’s** ***part of the soul*** **of the story.** These shows don’t just use food as background; they celebrate it as culture, comfort, and connection.

**🌶️ Some fan-favorite titles you’ll find:**

1mv9p1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1mv9p1r/does_gain_liquid_detergent_really_deliver_on/,Does Gain Liquid Detergent Really Deliver on Long-Lasting Freshness? Detailed Review,"**Does it Really Smell That Good? Test Driving Gain + Aroma Boost, 30772115961** 

I’ve been on the hunt for a liquid laundry detergent that doesn’t just clean surfaces but really transforms them. Gain + Aroma Boost Laundry Detergent Liquid, 30772115961 had me intrigued with its promise of a fresh scent that lingers for weeks. With 107 loads packed into its 154 fl oz bottle, this is not just a detergent; it’s a lifestyle choice. As a person who spends too much time wondering why clean clothes don’t always smell that way, this product had to go through the wringer—literally.

---

**Packaging and Design Appeal**

The moment I hauled the bottle into my laundry room, its bright green and colorful label screamed freshness. It’s one of those products that seem to invite you to do laundry. The bottle is hefty but manageable (weighing 9.63 pounds, to be exact), and the measuring cap has clear markings for the recommended amount per load. Nothing fussy here; it’s straightforward, functional, and as user-friendly as possible. The childproof cap adds a layer of safety too, which is especially reassuring if you’ve got curious kids underfoot.

---

**The Stand-Out Features**

I had to test its “Aroma Boost” claim because, let’s face it, not all “fresh” laundry products deliver what they promise. After tackling a mix of workout gear (which, as you guessed, was less than pleasant-smelling), towels, and everyday wear, I could smell the original scent wafting through the air. It wasn’t obnoxious or overwhelming; it was just clean and crisp with a hint of that classic Gain perfume. What's impressive is the scent actually stuck around for days, even in drawers.  

Performance-wise, the cleaning ability is solid. If you’ve tackled coffee stains or crushed candy on kids' clothes like I have, you know not all detergents are equal. This one gave my clothes a quick refresh without needing multiple washes, even in cold water, which is a game-changer for saving energy. 

One of the product’s unexpected perks? It’s phosphate-free. Small details like that make a big difference when trying to be kinder to the environment.

---

**Strengths**

- Long-lasting original scent that keeps clothes fresh for weeks.  
- Effective in both regular and high-efficiency machines, and it performs impressively in cold water.  
- Generous amount; the 154 fl oz size is perfect for tackling large households or frequent laundry days.  
- Powerful formula with Oxi Boost and Febreze for stain removal and odor elimination.  

---

**Flaws**

That’s not to say everything’s perfect.  

- The size of the bottle, while economical, can feel bulky and unmanageable when pouring.
- Its gradual scent buildup might not appeal to those looking for a more subtle fragrance.  
- The detergent cap, while practical, needs thorough rinsing to avoid gunky residue buildup.

---

**Performance Compared to Peer Products**

In a direct face-off with other big names like Tide and Persil, Gain obviously sets itself apart with its legendary fragrance. However, Tide offers a slightly deeper clean on things like motor oil stains (don’t ask me how I know this), while Persil feels more fine-tuned for delicate fabrics. That said, for everyday laundry riddled with basic dirt and odors, Gain hits a sweet spot. Plus, its compatibility with all washer types, including HE units and cold water settings, gives it a leg-up in terms of efficiency.

---

**Bang for the Buck**  

Here’s where it shines most brightly. The sheer number of loads you can get from one bottle—107, to be exact—translates into serious savings over time. Comparable detergents in the same price bracket struggle to deliver this kind of longevity paired with performance. Add that to its fresh scent and reliable cleaning abilities, and it feels like you're getting more than your money’s worth.

Friday will be my (32F) last day at my current job, and I’m not sure what to bring to the office.Just a quick disclaimer: English is not my first language, so I ran this post through a spell checker.

I think it’s relevant to mention that I’m from Europe, and at least around here, we have this habit of treating people when something good happens. If it’s your birthday, you take people out to eat or invite them over for food and drinks. At work, you at least bring snacks or buy coffee for everyone. It goes further—if you buy something big like a car or an apartment, or get a promotion, you also bring something or invite people for drinks after work. It’s just a way of celebrating together.

For bigger milestones—like turning 40 or 50, retiring, switching jobs, getting a promotion, or having a baby—coworkers usually raise money to buy a gift or give you an envelope with cash.

So, like I said, I’m leaving on Friday for a new job. I’ve been here for the past two years. I work closely with about 12 people, but there are around 30 on our floor, and I see them daily. I have a good relationship with quite a few coworkers (though I wouldn’t call them friends), and I get along well with the rest. I’d like to leave a pleasant “aftertaste.”

Most people know I’ve quit, but because I’ve had quite a few days of annual leave to use up, they don’t really know when my actual last day is. 

I’m quite introverted and don’t enjoy being the center of attention. When coworkers have left in the past, they’ve called a meeting, ordered pizzas and sodas, or brought baked goods. Sometimes we went out for drinks after work, on their tab. I don’t want to do that. I usually skip the “pizza meetings.” I also don’t want to announce it publicly—I prefer speaking to small groups.

I was thinking of bringing homemade breakfast chia cups, juices and sodas, and some desserts (like panna cotta cups, brownies, banana bread…). Maybe I could set up a little “snack stack.” We don’t have a snack station or anything like that, so this could be something nice that lasts a couple of weeks for my colleagues.

For the few colleagues who don’t work in the same building but whom I’d still think I should say goodbye to, I’m planning to treat them to coffee in small groups at our office bar—probably two pairs of people.

My partner thinks I am complicating my life and it doesn't even matter because I am leaving.   
  
What do you think is best to bring? Is this ""snack stalk"" an OK idea or is it kind of stupid? Or should I just clench my teeth and go with the pizza thing? ",1,1755680695.0,office,0,1.0,False

Two friends launch a cozy café: warm lights, board games, live music offline vibes were 10/10. Online? Flat. Ads got clicks, but not enough conversions. Reviews existed, but they didn’t convey the experience.

**What was missing:**

* Story-rich reviews (most were “good coffee”, not “why it’s special”).
* Visual social proof (ambience, décor, live music, crowd mood).
* Centralized “proof hub” to point ads and bio links to.

**What changed (Feedspace-powered):**

* QR-on-tables + receipts Make leaving feedback effortless, right at peak emotion.
* Prompt design Asked for “vibe” videos: sweeping shots, music clips, aesthetic corners, plating, board games, lighting transitions.
* Mixed-format testimonials Short text for skim readers; 15-30s videos for feel; photo carousels for aesthetic.
* Wall of Love A single, shareable page aggregating top text+photo+video testimonials, continually refreshed.
* Staff scripting Servers asked one specific question: “What moment made tonight special?” to elicit story, not adjectives.

**Results within weeks:**

* New visitors arrived “pre-sold” they already knew the mood.
* Ads converted better (creative borrowed directly from customer clips).
* Negative signals (e.g., “wait time”) became ops inputs; the team adjusted live music timings and seating.

**Key takeaway:**

Don’t sell “coffee.” Sell the validated experience. Let customers show it for you with structure.

 I want a sofa desk that actually tucks under the couch and doesn’t wiggle every time I type or the cat hops up. I read a review of a rolling bedside/sofa table and realized the little details matter more than I thought: true height range (so it clears the armrest and my knees), locking casters so it doesn’t slowly drift, and a base that’s slim enough to slide under the couch (mine only has like 2–2.5"" of clearance). A slight tilt top sounded nice for wrists, but those raised edges can block the mouse, which is… not ideal.

My place has a plush rug, so wobble is my big fear. Does the heavier “overbed” style feel more stable than the skinny C-shapes on carpet?

 Budget maybe $120, but I’ll stretch if it saves my back, lol.

I grew up in a family of very superstitious aunties. At age 13 is when I was told these stories by multiple family members including my parents, however I can remember many of the stories as they spoke of this house my whole childhood and on and these are the stories I was told. When I was only about 10 months old my mother and father were looking for a larger home as they already had my older brother myself and my mother was also pregnant at the time with my second youngest brother. We lived in a small town where everyone knew everyone. So a friend of a friend told my parents of a place right by the lakefront and it was close to the hospital actually right across from the hospital my mother was to give birth to my baby brother, not to mention it was fully furnished because the man who owned it had it passed to him through his two aunts who passed from cancer. Apparently he wasn't close to them even describing them as mean and didn't feel comfortable living in the home and felt it needed a family to lighten it up and give it some happiness my mother later told me. Fast forward to a month later and we are living in this beautiful bungalow style home with big oak doors and shutters on the windows as well as a library with a nice old rocking chair my mother could read to us in. It started off with small things like when my grandma would bring her favorite little Yorkie over he would just stare and bark at the stairs over and over hair standing straight growling and all. My grandma stopped bringing him by because of this but no one thought this was strange. Just saying I would have, but anyways one day my mom was filling our kitty pool with a hose running from the basement window so the water wouldn't be to cold for us, but my brother kept pushing on it and my mother was afraid he would fall through it so she asked my gramps who was visiting if he could watch us while she went and locked it. At this time it was only my mom my gramps and me and my brother home. My mom grabbed the laundry basket off the dryer and went to lock the window but it was already locked she thought it to be strange but my gramps said it must have been our guardian angels keeping us safe. But my brother said no mom its the man in the big boots! This was the first time he mentioned the man in the big boots but it definitely wouldn't be the last. As the days went on things became increasingly active from big doors and windows blowing open multiple times every night to my parents waking up in the middle of the night to see my brother talking to the man in the big boots. One day my brother and I were playing on the kitchen floor while my mother was  making coffee when she passed over us with a pot of hot coffee as she did the carafe busted over us luckily my father rushed us into a cold bath and we didn't have any serious burns but when she looked at the bottom of the coffee pot there was a perfect circle Cutt from the bottom. At this point the whole family knew our house was haunted and many were even afraid to visit. But my parents were young and my father was the bread winner and they had a third child on the way with a big house with cheap rent they looked at it as taking the good with the bad I guess. Soon they found out from my big brother that the two old ladies didn't like us there but the man in the big boots who my brother described looking like an old fisherman wanted to protect us. So on my grandmothers 50th birthday they arranged to have a psychic to come to our home and finally find out what was in our house or who? All of my aunties and uncles showed up and believe me I have a lot as well as some good friends everyone wanted to know what was in our house. But when the psychic finally arrived she refused to pass through the mudd room she took one look and said this house is evil you must leave here now. Everyone laughed taking the lady as a joke. She left and they decided they were all going to go out for the night as my mother was finishing getting ready in the upstairs bathroom my aunts and uncles watched me crawling all around as I had just started, while talking about the crazy psychic. I began climbing the stairs while they watched over me. I was trying to reach my mother at the top of the stairs. As I got to the first landing I was lifted in to the air and thrown down to the front door and a loud voice yelled get out. That was the proof I guess they all needed because we were out by the end of the month. There were so many other things that happened that are beyond explanation and crazy but I would be writing a book at that point and well I'm sure you can tell I'm not one for punctuations. Since that day many more things have happened to me specifically and to some of my siblings however my stories get progressively more ominous and other worldly. Well I know some of you will not believe me but this is the life I live and I truly believe whatever was in that house has followed me to this day. I am God fearing because God has been the only thing that has ever helped me fight these beings I can see,hear and smell now. To be continued....",2,1755679990.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False

1mv95qo,https://i.redd.it/2n2ncqvhy4kf1.png,help with roommates badly behaved cat,"I’ve been living with my roommate for about three months. We know each other from school and are staying in the city over the summer for internships. We’re supposed to keep living together through the fall semester too. She’s nice and friendly, but I’m honestly getting exhausted by her and her cat. She found him on the street about a month before she moved in to the apartment, and about two weeks before move-in, she asked if she could bring her cat. I said no because I’m allergic. She told me he was hypoallergenic and “excited to meet me,” and I didn’t have the energy to argue. I really regret that now.

Since day one, the cat has been acting out. First night in the apartment, he peed everywhere and scratched the coffee table. She started keeping him in her bedroom at night, but now he howls nonstop. She literally never leaves the apartment and he still howls incessantly. During my Zoom meetings and calls, he’s in the background yowling. He also lunges, hisses, and scratches at me even though I literally ignore him and never approach him. He still is feral and my roomate doesn't really do anything about it.

He constantly goes to the door and windows crying to be outside and paces around like he’s restless. My roomate doesn't let him outside and it's clear he's miserable.

She sleeps in bed with it overnight and complains about all the scathes and ""love-bites"" he gives her. She puts tiny boots on him “so his paws stay protected,” and buys him new toys every constantly. She literally waves a stuffed fake bird in front of him saying “you don’t need the outside world, you have this.” Which fells crappy. I didn't know until this situation that it's not safe for cats to be free-roaming but I still feel like he needs to be outside at least for at least part of the day. I've offered to walk the cat but my roomate says he hates the leash so ig that wouldn't work either. He howls all day and the only thing that quiets him is when my roomate feeds him- she tells me to feed him whenever im annoyed by his yells but I don't because...

The cat is severely overweight from all of this. He struggles to jump on the couch. He trips over his own stomach, knocks things over, and pants after walking across the room. The vet already told her the peeing is behavioral and that he’s obese, and she still just says “he’s just healthy now”

The apartment smells like pee and litter 24/7 and she refuses to set any boundaries with the cat, so the howling, scratching, and destruction keeps getting worse. She thinks this is all normal and keeps telling me he “just needs more love.”

I feel like I’m going crazy and I still have to live here until December. I don’t blame the cat — he’s just acting like an animal — but I’m exhausted and starting to resent both of them.

She has 5 litterboxes for the cat in each room of the apartment (even in mine because he figured out how to open the door (clever guy) and likes to pee in my bed when im gone :) ) but doesn't use them- im guessing she probably never trained him so he poops and pees wherever he wants, he has a million cat trees all around the apartment, and she is constantly petting and playing with him so it's not that he's neglected and acting out.

Im kinda at a loss. I've only had dogs and rodents and am pretty cluelesss about cats. I do not know what to do to help this guy, im not big on cats but this dude has an awful quality of life, how do I help improve his behavior withtou crossing a line? My roomates very protective of the cat and hasn't reacted well in the past when I brought up training him?

He is snipped so that isn't the issue and unforch I can not move out without getting a fine from my university because technically my roomate hasn't broken our roomate agreement we signed (before I knew about the cat) so it would count as ending the lease on my terms, and she wouldn't have to pay.

So I've been on a low-key mission to find *delicious* Vietnamese coffee in Dubai, not the watered-down versions some cafes try to pass off, but the real deal: strong, slow-dripped Phin coffee with that sweet condensed milk magic.

After a few misses, I stumbled across this cosy little spot (not naming names unless anyone asks – not trying to promo or anything) that legit transported me back to Hanoi. They use the traditional Phin filter, and the flavour was *chef's kiss*, rich, chocolatey, and strong enough to wake the dead lol.

I've always loved the slow ritual of Vietnamese coffee. There's something super calming about watching it drip. If you're a fan of bold brews and haven't tried it yet, you're seriously missing out. And if you're in Dubai, there *are* a few hidden places that do it justice. You gotta dig a little.

Also, is anyone here brewing it at home with a Phin filter? I'm grabbing some authentic beans and giving it a go myself. Would love tips if you've got any.

When I’ve done my spell for myself or others it works, but never for this person. A good friend who is an incredible witch and has helped me get unstuck when things are a bit too much also tried to help him, and it doesn’t work for him

I don’t need a spell per se: I use red candles, bay leaves, coffee, a blessing oil and deity work. My question is: I’ve told this person that I’m going to do a spell for them and asked them for their permission, and I feel that when they are aware they sort of reject the energy. Would it be ethical to try to do a spell for him without letting him know I am doing it based on the fact that he has given me consent before? Part of me is “what he doesn’t know can’t hurt him” but other part of me strongly believes consent applies here too.

Any advice? Would be helpful to hear about similar stories and what people have done.

1mv92o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlgenius/comments/1mv92o9/gg_gurps_adventures/,GG Gurps Adventures,"I eagerly snatched up the Girl Genius GURPS supplement when it became available, and I've wondered if anyone else did so, and have run any games with it? I managed to play two little campaigns:

The first one was with only two players, who were a wild jaeger and a rat with a slinky spring middle, wandering the wasteland in search of adventure. They found a town that had captured an old fashioned clank (the townsfolk awaiting the sun to come out so they could melt it with a giant magnifying glass tower) just in time to figure out the clank's job was to warn people about a giant, moving city on wheels crushing everything in its path, which promptly appeared, stopping just outside the town. Running on clockwork as it was and needing a bit to wind itself, they had twelve hours to infiltrate the city before it started up again and smooshed the town. Turned out the coty (which was full of clockwork people on rails) was malfunctioning because it was infested with gremlins. They killed the gremlins, fixed the clockwork city, and it flew away into the sky! Huzzah!

The second game I ran was a nine player affair, and I asked everyone to pair up into masters and minions (which included such abominations as a gillman with a horseman butler, a spark that had transplanted their brain into a cat stuffy, a pop singer from the future, and a coffee-machine clank). All the sparks were students from England (the ""St. Thistledome Priory"", they decided) traveling to Beetleburg to participate in TSU's annual science fair competition. Unfortunately, on the eve of the competition, many of the experiments were sabotaged, and they had to find out by who!
After wandering around campus and accusing a lot of people, they realized the culprit was actually a phlebotinum-eating hamster, which turned into a GIANT phlebotinum-eating hamster, and began to stomp the school flat whilst sneezing out interdimensional horrors (like an alien in a flying teapot, a shoggoth, and a triangle that posed math problems under threat of academic probation and death). Eventually they decided that, since the phlebotinum was empowering the hamster, the best solution was to develop a giant cannon that would shoot laxative coffee, and force the hamster to - ah, ""purge"" itself, whereupon it shrank back down. With the crisis averted, the fair continued, and one of the players won with their ""memory foam mattress"" (which eats people's memories).

If anyone else has dabbled around with rpg'ing girl genius, I'd love to hear what scientific escapes you undertook!",4,1755678542.0,girlgenius,0,1.0,False

Ever since I started using an MMO mouse years and years ago, I have never been able to go back to a regular mouse. Only for when i play FPS. I used to have a Razer Naga then a Logitech G600 and now a Steelseries Aerox 9. 

My problem is that I spilled coffee on my first Aerox 9, and the scroll wheel stopped working, so I bought a used one from a friend who had barely used it. That was a few months ago and now it's not properly registering my 3 and 4 button + the scroll wheel sometimes goes up when im scrolling down. I really like the way the mouse feels, but I cba buying another one if it's just gonna stop working properly again (I read multiple threads on these problems, they seem very common).

So I'm wondering what your favourite MMO mouse is, preferably something not too expensive. 

My only requirements are that it has to have between 9-12 buttons on the side and it has to be durable. ",1,1755678373.0,MouseReview,5,0.67,False

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

1mv8y83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mv8y83,I created a List of TV Shows Related to Korean Food,"I'm a huge fan of both cinema/kdrama and Korean cuisine, and honestly, nothing makes me hungrier than seeing steaming hot tteokbokki or kimchi making or sizzling samgyeopsal on screen.

That’s why I went down a delicious rabbit hole recently, looking for movies / tv shows where **Korean food isn't just in the background, but plays a meaningful, flavorful role in the story.**

Over the years, there have been some beautiful films and dramas where food becomes more than just a prop or scene - it becomes a symbol of love, grief, nostalgia, or healing. From sizzling hot pots shared between family members, to kimchi-making scenes that hit harder than you'd expect, these moments stay with you long after the credits roll.

**So I decided to put all those titles together in one place.**

Whether you're looking for emotional family dramas, slice-of-life comfort stories, or films where food and memory are deeply intertwined - this list was made for you. While Korean dramas are well known for food-focused scenes, it turns out there are also **plenty of films** that beautifully showcase meals, cooking, family traditions, and culinary culture in their own way.

It has been a couple months since ive last talked about any concept art that ive been making and well- today is the day! Whilst I was busy playing games, relaxing, and drawing funny things. I was still getting Ideas for my From the Ashes Concept DLC!

Today will be me explaining a couple of things- and from the last spoiler I gave we will be discussing mostly about **Biomes!**



No world is perfect in Dont Starve without a ton of biomes to explore, find resources, and find creatures exclusive to these zones!

Given that most of the content here is probably already been seen before but, there are many things nobody has seen, was only in sketch form, or it just wasnt all pieced together. Until now!



Starting off we have the **Ashy Wastes**

  


https://preview.redd.it/3no9djqrv4kf1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=20f3357c6b8ab20cdaf70175ed9451452b4c1961

The Ashy Wastes is a biome similar to the volcano in shipwreck, using the same turf and even charcoal boulders. Within this we have new additions! Ashy plants everywhere that can be harvested, the Rok Pok Plant, and even a Gilded Charcoal Boulder!

Charcoal boulders will not just give Charcoal and Flint but will also give rocks as well- 

The Gilded Charcoal boulders replace those very rocks with gold instead.

This is where everyone will start at with the Florid Postern. It has no creatures as of yet that roam the area but that can change!





Next up! The **Volcanic Valley**

  


https://preview.redd.it/1m15y2csv4kf1.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffaea6acf00f993ca931c1c537aa7b633f65b9a

This Valley is well known for its flaming pillars of rock, magmatic dwellers that hang from said rocks, and even Lavae Dens to make sure this place is not safe for anyone!



Lava Ponds exist with new fish types that havent been fully explained yet-

Obsidian Spawns here but is more of something that you find but cant quite collect yet.

Magmactus is one of the two plants here that grows faster in hotter climates.

The Stonestool is the opposite- growing in colder climates.

The Lavae dens in the first 2 seasons will be collapsed and cant actually spawn Lavaes. However- from seasons 3-5 it will be burning bright with lavae madness!

Moltelopes are a creature that live in this hostile environment- being a neutral creature similar to volt goats. You can befriend them which may be useful for when you need to cook food- as their crystalized antlers emit a flaming aura that you can on with ease!

The Magmatic Dweller hangs from the pillars and swings down when it gets dark- These Spiders are really dangerous with a charged bite that can set you ablaze!

Magma Golems return within these ponds and are no longer friend but rather foe! Coming out of these ponds stationary to throw 2 fireballs at you, before retreating inside the lava pool to recharge.



Now onto what our teaser image was all about! The **Glass Desert**

  


https://preview.redd.it/999nxt4uv4kf1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=07d524a852e5161855edd3e9f1946145c2ee2c79

This place is jam packed full of shards of glass that have melted together and reformed into a mosaic art piece!  


Boulders will form with glass shards poking out- when mined they will give you just some extra bits of glass.

However- a creature you may encounter here is a bit more interesting- The Glass Bee comes out of these Glass Bee Hives in which they go around in search to pollenate- normally their is nothing to pollenate since well- its a desert of glass!

These creatures when attacked will break instantly, gaining the agro of other glass bees to charge at you and sting you!

Sadly- once stung the bee instantly shatters from its fragile body.

The glass they are made of is extremely useful for future content and is nothing compared to the glass you can simply mine.

The essence of life inside the glass is what makes it strong and valuable- but is impossible to gain on your own-

Now you may ask- why could aid in our ability to collect these bees? Well- in this world there is an ocean. Though this Ocean is slightly different in that is full of lava! 

Introducing The **Magma Waves**

  


https://preview.redd.it/lfapg3quv4kf1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff353cf6ba943717e217610ef2ab7744ab7d6d8

Near the shores of glass deserts there will be these plants known as Lavaworts.

These plants trick the bees into pollenating them, then once they are done, the Lavawort snags the bee and consumes it. Leaving a glass deposit of the living glass material that is easy to transport. All you need is to pick it from the plant!  




Now to get across the waves you must create some specific items which will chill the lava rapidly- creating a raft that you can move around on! Be sure to mine the magma stacks in the sea of lava!

Some spiders do in fact live in this abominable weather! In fact- 2 of them are labeled as fire born creatures! 

The Magmatic Hider and the Magmatic Spitter both are spiders imbued in the lava and take great satisfaction on the heat of the season cycles.

They dont need to stand on the rafts like some spiders and will prefer to walk through the lava on their feet.

The Magmatic Strider is a faster foe on lava in which was born to adapt to. It increases in speed on lava as it glides through- Being able to do a dash attack to enemies. Once on land its slower than normal spiders and attacks less rapid.

Level 2 and 3 Golems exist which are very deadly in the magma waves!

The level 2 is able to shoot 4 fireballs at you before needing to dive to recharge for a while

However- The Level 3 rises from the lava, and will start off by hitting you with 8 fireballs! Then once its complete, it wont dive down to recharge. Instead- the bottom part of the golem keeps giving energy to the top golem to be able to throw out a fireball every so often at the player once it reaches a minimum charge of 1 fireball. Once the player leaves it will sink back down into the lava, awaiting its next prey



Now onto the Next biome The **Singed Meadows**

  


https://preview.redd.it/bbesmmcvv4kf1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0af2d1a14b81c025beebbf7155a0e29038a9d98

This area is full of ashy grass, Cinderhorns, Turmeeple, and Lavasuckle.

The Lavasuckle is valuable in that it can be used to make special armor to prevent fire born damage but in return- converting it into heat.

The Cinderhorn is a beefalo-like creature that can be ridden and has a special horn. When it consistently attacks an enemy the horn grows brighter and brighter until it starts dealing more damage and including fire damage!

Turmeeple are creatures that defend a mandrake-like create the Turmeep. When sleeping you can steal its turmeeps, turning them into a special crock pot dish known as Turmeeple Syrup. These creatures are passive and will run really fast to get away from you, to then quickly burrow underground.



Next we have The **Red Forest**

  


https://preview.redd.it/j6r6wwsvv4kf1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee1cf7a10ad93358f5f77f4bfe137f2cc0f67d70

A biome where the Cultic Fisher birds live and where the coffee plants blossom!

Similar to pig king, They have their own forest with Red Trees, and settlements with stone structures that house these cultic creatures.

Occasionally you may find a dead Cultist- where it may guide you to fate or fortune.

Wendy players always gain Fortune in their attunement with the dead.



Next on the list we have the **Sulfur Silklands**

  


https://preview.redd.it/p32eu0awv4kf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d401efa431b3610c55102f502151b9da086a90

A biome that smells putrid with magmatic spider dens everywhere! Home to the Magmatic warrior spider, being able to lunge twice but then become dizzy afterwards.

Sulfur Deposits grow from openings in the ground which can be mined for Pure Sulfur.

This place during later seasons can become deadly- with large amounts of spiders and a poisonous haze that shrouds the area from the increased heat, be sure to bring some breathing equipment!



Lastly- we have the **Blood Bogs**

https://preview.redd.it/i0c3elnwv4kf1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca9d557fb0ad24bbbfb1fb4815252c1b323e77e

  


This area is known for its advanced creatures infused with a liquid that isnt quite blood but more so a powerful substance that comes off of Blood Lavaes.

Blood Lavaes pop out of these ponds to search for Crimson Wheat. Eventually over time the lavaes that eat enough will crystalize and start to incubate into Blood Broodlings- A dangerous creature that has channeled the power of the Lavae Biproduct into a hypnotic power that can lure players in for a deadly strike.

When a year passes in this world- the cold becomes slightly colder- allowing ponds to freeze up into a concentrated amount of blood crystals.

Speaking of blood crystals- formations that can be mined already exist! However- it gives you a less concentrated blood crystal which is still extremely useful.

Angerflish can be fished/mined out of these ponds where they reside. They are really good in making hearty dishes from their extensive consumption of the Lavae Deposits

Crimson Wheat is a Wheat plant found near blood ponds, which also absorbs the Lavae Deposits- creating powerful dishes that can improve health and strength of survivors.

Puncture Fruit creates a special fruit that it grasps tightly to protect its fruit from Blood Lavaes. The fruit is also quite beneficial in creating pastes that can be good first aid.



Now given- this is all the biomes I have made so far- Im already planning more with the Magma golems in maybe finding a thing they could be guarding in their own biome. However- I wont just leave you with these biomes- but rather- Im going to show you the 5 other bosses that could be in the DLC after beating the first 5 bosses.



Starting off we have **Infurnal Clops Unchained**  




https://preview.redd.it/z771ien1w4kf1.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=36c67fb1c30b8232f5a3e2786d61e6462675374e

This Monster of a creature is really powerful! being imbued with a spectral flame from the Altar once all 5 of the gems were socketed. These gems are obtained by defeating one of each of the bosses-

Including-  


Infurnal Clops  
King Krissure  
Lavae King  
Great Knobbly Treeguard  
and Magmatic Spiderqueen  


Once socketed- the gems power a forge like altar which unleashes the unbound power of monsters who use to roam the ashy lands-

The Infurnal Clops Unchained is stronger- faster- and has more HP than its previous life-



Next we all know- if there is a glass bee- there must be a **Glass Beequeen**

https://preview.redd.it/zw4afp12w4kf1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1eaacd2cc9eb64e314a63ec8f2f4f5c8426b7d6

  


This Mosaic Monarch has been gifted in many ways- but hindered in others-

For instance- She no longer has a stinger, or a hive to command her bees. Instead- she uses a devastating ground pound attack which creates shockwaves around her.

Instead of constantly dripping honey like her Constant Counterpart- She occasionally (10ish seconds) drops a glob of glass from her melting form.

This glass damages and slows the player so its best to stay away from them- However, Glass bees will start to emerge from this glass pile to aid their Monarch!



its getting heated with the new bosses- Including **Flameel**

https://preview.redd.it/iqz7q3j2w4kf1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7bdc1121eb25bbb70b6c798de279eb8936724e

  


Flameel is born from the lava and has a mask that controls the power of flaming weather- Being able to shroud itself in a flaming tornado where it damages and burns players. The best way is to try and chill the eel down so that it becomes stunned- falling to the ground and being vulnerable with no tornado to protect it for a moment. 



Whilst we did speak of a biome called the Blood Bogs- we do have another Queen of the Broodlings- **Blood Dragonfly**

  


https://preview.redd.it/l9272vt3w4kf1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=639c5a7b6644ae92f12b88db212c7a4e313cf32c

Honing in on its hypnotic abilities it is able to multitask by luring you in- whilst damaging you with its crystal claws.

This fuzzy beast cant enrage but does become more desperate in trying to kill you if it gets too low. Pounding the ground, Spewing flames, even summoning Blood Lavae to assist!



Finally we have our last boss- Which is similar to a famous trio of creatures known as shadow pieces- Introducing- **Jack-O-Cafs**

  


https://preview.redd.it/ekqe45l4w4kf1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=15eb7b5c117a70f5a807e1b048833f445735089b

The flame that imbued the coffee plant didnt take into consideration that the roots of the plant is interconnected with others-

Leaving one giant root of a beast to hold the flame withing- whilst having 2 other disciples to keep him safe.

Bigroot is the one in the middle- who holds the flame inside that keeps them alive- so why not just go after him first?

Well- his other familiars have channeled their strength together to make him immune to damage whilst either are alive.

Whilst Bigroot is alive- he will boost LootRoot (Left) and FlootRoot (Right)

LootRoot has the power of thievery- being able to swipe at you and knock off armor or weapons. It can also do a bite attack which doesnt do a lot of damage.



FlootRoot is more agile, being able to shoot a laser from its flaming eye with devastating damage. It can also swipe at the player- knocking them back.



BigRoot can spew flames, and can bite you. However- Bigroot cant move tradionally- BigRoot has to burrow into the ground and rise up to be able to move. Whilst BigRoot is alive, he sends off a special aura that boosts the other roots by a little bit. 

When you kill one of the roots, Bigroot will transfer all its available energy from boosting both roots into boosting a single root by a large amount.

Making Lootroot faster and being able to swipe armor and weapons at the same time, whilst having a more dangerous bite.

or FlootRoot who does a double laser attack and can do a triple swipe combo to knock you back.





That is all for this concept dump! I feel like I havent put a lot into this post but also part of me feels that building all of the fragments together is still nice progress to see- Anywho everyone, we will see when I make the next one and it will most likely be either about 2 topics-
