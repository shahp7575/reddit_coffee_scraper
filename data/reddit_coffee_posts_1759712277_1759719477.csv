Hamtown Mercantile is a really good place to explore in Smithfield, VA!

There's a bunch of different vendors all in one convenient location that sell a wide variety of things.

I found merch, clothes, sauces, spices, jewelry, candy, soda, cheese, candles, board games, tea, coffee, honey, soap, crochet, and a lot more that I can't remember!

Plus they have this little self serve Keurig machine where you can get a $3.00 cup of coffee or hot chocolate with a couple of flavored creamers to keep you going while you explore the rest of Main St.

If you ever visit, tell em Dinnie said hi!

1nz7sy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nz7sy4/did_anybody_else_grow_up_with_a_weird_bug_disease/,did anybody else grow up with a weird bug disease???,"Ok, so I‚Äôve been asking so many people, and nobody seems to know what I‚Äôm talking about. What the fuck is up with bugs?

For some context, I grew up in southern Oklahoma. It was a really small town- we didn‚Äôt even have a Waffle House. Everyone knew everyone, and there was only one neighborhood, if you could call it that. It was super rare that someone new would move in, and the town overall had a creepy vibe. But it was enjoyable to grow up there. It was the 2000s-2010s, and my weeknights and weekends were spent riding on a four-wheeler, playing cops and robbers, and having intense Just Dance and Wii Sports tournaments. I was close with all my neighbors, even those who lived further down my street. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. There were two big rules in my hometown.

1. Before you go outside, you have to spray yourself head to toe in a specific brand of bug spray.
2. If you were bitten by a sort of bug, you had to tell your parents immediately.

I think the reason I never questioned it was because I grew up like that. My older brother grew up like that. Everyone in the neighborhood and their older siblings grew up that way. Even kids who had long been off to college followed those rules when they were my age. But let me explain.

The bug spray was a special brand that I've never seen in any retail store. In all honesty, I don't know how my parents even got it. There were always three extra bottles sitting in the medicine cabinet, on top of the everyday bottle. It burned a little when you put it on, but the sting stopped after just a few minutes. I don't know too much about it, but I know that this rule was heavily enforced.

The other big thing was actually being bitten. It was super rare for anybody to get bitten by a bug. Whatever they put in the bug spray did its job well. But on the off chance you did get bitten, you HAD to tell your parents. I was only ever bitten by one bug. A colony of bright red fire ants had decided to make a cozy little home right off my family's front porch. One time, I had fallen into it, and I was rushed to the Petersons' house.

To be honest, I don't know much about the Petersons. I know that it was a single dad and his son, Andrew, and two cats. Their home was odd. The 2nd floor was the actual home, with a full kitchen, living room, beds, and baths, etc. But the main floor was the crappy make-shift doctor's office. A small waiting room with a side table that housed a coffee machine, a long hallway that held 3 doors (two on the left, one on the right), and a bathroom.

If you were bitten, you were rushed to the Petersons. You would sit in the waiting room for 10 minutes max and then be pulled into the 1st room on the left or the only room on the right. It was a small doctor's room. Mr. Peterson would come into the room, prick your finger, and draw some blood. He would leave, and soon after, he would come back and do a few normal tests. He made you follow light with your eyes, tested your hearing, and he even used the little rubber thing on the joints. After the blood test was done, he would come back and tell you that you were free to go. More often than not, I would get a lollipop while my parents thanked him profusely.

There are two reasons I'm asking about this. One time, I explained all of that to my roommate, and she looked at me like I was insane. She told me stuff like ""that isn't normal"" or ""what the hell are you talking about?""

The other reason is a story. I lived with this kid named Billy. He was annoying, but his mom made some bomb ass brownies, so we let him play Wii tennis with us. However, one 4th of July weekend, Billy fell stomach-first into an ant hill. Several kids had been playing cops and robbers when Billy and a girl named Hannah came sprinting around the side of the house. Hannah jumped the sidewalk, but Billy tripped. His mom freaked the fuck out. She yanked him up, covered him so nobody would see, and threw him into the car. She hauled him off to the Petersons. I never saw Billy after that. That family moved away shortly after.

I assumed Billy was dead. I don't remember him being allergic to ants, but I guess I would have never known. The oddest thing, I remember Billy's face as his mother grabbed him. I've always told myself it was just the shadows, or some weird mind fuck. But now? You know the little antennae that ants have? I swear to you, it looked like they were growing out of his skin. Like molting, they blended and looked natural. I want to pretend like I didn't see it and push it away, but looking back, I can't help but doubt myself.

Sorry for my rambling. I just want to know if anybody knows what I'm talking about. My roommate called me crazy, my parents won't explain, and I'm trying not to go insane.",1,1759719245.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Hello there and happy whatever is left of Sunday! 

Now that I got your attention, **how you doin?**üòä

I gotta come clean first, I did make an attempt at playing some of Mariah‚Äôs tunes briefly today, followed by Michael Bubbl√©‚Ä¶. Was not feeling though! Turned the playlist into Lauren Hill, The Roots, Erykah Badu and **Bad Bunny** really quick lol 

Okay, now after you probably judged my music taste, how about you tell me something about yours? Or about whatever is on your mind this fine evening! 

Let me go ahead and make a quick, friendly disclaimer, as much as I really want a crazy hot distraction, the steamy chats that come with it, I would absolutely love to have, carry a decent conversation for a change‚Ä¶. Perhaps something that can last for more than 5 minutes! Better yet, roll into the next morning, day! Haha. Tough, I know lol. 

I love walks on the beach, hot chocolate/drinks by the fireplace, reading romance novels‚Ä¶ jk!!!!! Got you! Seriously though, I do love the beach, and you can most definitely catch me there any day of the week! I do enjoy a good book/read often, humor as a life necessity, a woman in a flower dress, (threw that in here as my post Easter egg to find out if anyone actually reads a whole posting lol), and I‚Äôm an Italian coffee lover, connoisseur! I do enjoy light flirting every now and then, maybe more if the mood strikes but always, I mean always attracted to intelligence and confidence in a woman. 


Well; now that I put my expectations forth, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! So what do you say? Let‚Äôs give this a try! No major expectations and I‚Äôll go with your flow lol. 

Cheers

 I currently have a low end machine, the DeLonghi Stilosa, with a bottomless portafilter I purchased separately, and a 1zpresso J Ultra hand grinder. The shots seem pretty good but inconsistent. The grinder works well but I kind of regret spending money it it instead of an automatic since it is a lot of work! I started with this setup getting into it but I enjoy espresso drinks much more than other types and make one daily since getting it.

I mostly enjoy making iced milk drinks and drink hot cortados or cappuccinos in cold months. I would drink occasional espresso alone if the shots were good. I have been eyeing the Profitec GO as my next machine, mostly because of the look and the colors, and that it fits my needs. It looks soo nice ! I need something with a small footprint and likely only need single boiler since most days I will be only making 1-2 drinks at a time. It is pricey though. 

I also want to get a new automatic grinder for espresso- but try to stay in the $300-400 range max. 

Do people like this machine? Recommendations for others based on my preferences? Recommendations for grinders? Is this really going to elevate my coffee experience to make it worth spending all of this money? Any feedback or advice is appreciated!!",1,1759718450.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

## Introduction

AI is redefining how we learn in 2025. From creative writing to voice cloning, every domain is being reshaped by artificial intelligence ‚Äî and now, learning itself is undergoing its biggest transformation yet. Studies by *McKinsey (2024)* and *PwC‚Äôs Future of Work Report (2025)* show that over 60% of professionals now rely on AI-driven microlearning tools to upskill faster and more efficiently. Into this fast-changing world enters [BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/), a next-generation platform that turns the world‚Äôs best books, expert talks, and academic research into personalized podcasts ‚Äî all tailored to your goals, time, and learning style.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore why **BeFreed** is not just another AI tool but a **personalized learning revolution**, powered by deep AI, flexible study design, and an evolving roadmap that grows with you.

## What Is BeFreed: Best AI Podcast Generator That Turns Books Into Podcasts in 2025?

**BeFreed** is an **AI-powered personalized learning app** that converts nonfiction knowledge ‚Äî from books, podcasts, and research papers ‚Äî into short, engaging **podcasts and study guides**. Built by an **AI research team from Columbia University**, it‚Äôs designed for people who want to learn faster and smarter ‚Äî without spending hours reading.

The platform uses a proprietary AI model that **distills, verifies, and personalizes** the knowledge you consume. Users can choose how deep they want to go ‚Äî **10-minute quick overviews, 20-minute commute sessions, or 40-minute immersive podcasts** ‚Äî all narrated by a customizable AI host whose tone and mood you can set.

Unlike generic AI tools, BeFreed doesn‚Äôt just summarize ‚Äî it curates and contextualizes. It draws from top nonfiction titles, expert podcasts, and research sources such as *Harvard Business Review*, *Huberman Lab*, and *The School of Life*, ensuring every lesson is rooted in verified, practical wisdom.

## Why BeFreed Is the Future of AI Learning in 2025

**Method snapshot:** 12 AI learning apps tested (Aug‚ÄìSep 2025) on iOS 17/Android 14; sources include official app listings, pricing pages, and developer notes. Metrics evaluated: personalization depth, audio UX, adaptive learning roadmap, factual accuracy, and update cadence.

AI learning platforms are rapidly converging toward one goal: **personalized, habit-forming education**. However, most existing tools focus narrowly on book summaries or passive listening. BeFreed breaks this mold by offering **multi-modal learning ‚Äî audio, text, video, and flashcards ‚Äî all connected by a personalized study roadmap** that adapts to your life, interests, and energy.

Let‚Äôs break down what makes BeFreed‚Äôs ecosystem distinct.

### 1. Flexible Learning Lengths for Every Schedule

BeFreed understands that your attention varies daily. Instead of forcing a single format, it lets users **choose learning depth dynamically**:

* **10-minute summaries** for morning coffee breaks
* **20-minute podcasts** for commutes or workouts
* **40-minute immersive sessions** when you want to explore deeply

This model stems from cognitive research showing that **micro-learning boosts long-term retention by up to 80% compared to passive reading** (*Journal of Applied Psychology, 2023*). The feature transforms ‚Äúlearning time‚Äù into flexible, rewarding moments throughout the day ‚Äî ideal for **busy professionals, students, and lifelong learners**.

### 2. Beyond Books: Blending Knowledge From Research, Podcasts & Experts

Where most platforms rely solely on best-seller summaries, **BeFreed** integrates a far wider knowledge base. Its AI curates and blends ideas from:

* **Bestselling nonfiction books** (e.g., *Atomic Habits*, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*)
* **Academic research papers** from sources like *Nature* and *Harvard Business Review*
* **Expert talks** and **podcasts** from modern thought leaders
* **YouTube masterclasses** from verified educators and creators

By weaving these together, BeFreed creates **cross-disciplinary, insight-rich podcasts** that make knowledge instantly actionable. For instance, one episode might combine insights from *Deep Work* (book), a *Huberman Lab* episode on focus, and a *Stanford GSB* lecture on time design to help you **reclaim your attention**.

### 3. A Hyper-Personalized Roadmap for Growth

Unlike static summary apps, **BeFreed builds an evolving roadmap** tailored to your progress, mood, and focus patterns. Its AI observes what you listen to, when you pause, and what you revisit ‚Äî then adjusts your upcoming lessons accordingly.

For young professionals, that may mean **leadership podcasts paired with flashcards on communication frameworks**. For students, it might prioritize **exam-oriented deep dives**. For lifelong learners, BeFreed may blend **psychology, creativity, and history content** into an emotionally intelligent learning path.

This approach aligns with *Harvard CEPR research (2024)* showing that adaptive microlearning improves motivation by 37% and retention by 52%.

Verdict: **BeFreed‚Äôs roadmap turns passive content into a guided, evolving journey toward mastery**.

### 4. Multi-Mode Learning for Every Style

BeFreed empowers **auditory, visual, and text-based learners** alike with multiple learning modes:

* üéß **AI-narrated podcasts** ‚Äî Choose your host‚Äôs tone: calm, energetic, or empathetic.
* üìñ **Readable summaries** ‚Äî Quick scans for note-takers or multilingual learners.
* üé¨ **Immersive video explainers** ‚Äî Especially for history or biography enthusiasts.

I‚Äôve spent a lot of time riding across Vietnam and sharing those rides on YouTube, so here‚Äôs the real deal :

First off,¬†**you legally need an international driving permit (IDP)**¬†with a motorcycle endorsement that‚Äôs valid in Vietnam ‚Äî specifically one based on the¬†**1968 Vienna Convention**. If your home country only issues the 1949 version (like the U.S.), technically it‚Äôs¬†*not*¬†recognized here. That said, a lot of travelers still rent or buy bikes and ride anyway, especially in the northern regions like Ha Giang or Sapa. Police don‚Äôt always check, but if there‚Äôs an accident, insurance won‚Äôt cover you unless your documents are proper.

Check out how to apply for an IDP to ride in Vietnam: [https://www.vietnamesemotorbiketours.com/how-to-get-an-international-driving-permit-for-vietnam](https://www.vietnamesemotorbiketours.com/how-to-get-an-international-driving-permit-for-vietnam)

**Second**, Vietnam traffic is... let‚Äôs say¬†*energetic*. It‚Äôs a mix of organized chaos, a lot of horns, scooters, trucks, dogs, and school kids all sharing the same lane. It looks insane at first, but after a few days you start to understand the rhythm. Locals flow like water, and the key is to¬†**go slow, stay predictable, keep a safe distance, and never make sudden moves** and do not forget to check your mirrors all the time.

**Third**, the experience is totally worth it. Riding through mountain passes like¬†**Ha Giang Loop**, coastal stretches between¬†**Hue and Hoi An**, or the¬†**Ho Chi Minh Road**¬†down to central Vietnam ‚Äî it‚Äôs pure freedom. You see villages, stop for coffee in random local spots, and talk to people who rarely meet foreigners. That‚Äôs the kind of adventure no tour bus can give you.

**A few quick tips:**

* Wear proper gear ‚Äî helmet, jacket, gloves. Locals ride in flip-flops, but don‚Äôt copy that.
* Use Google Maps¬†*downloaded offline*. Service drops in the mountains.
* If you‚Äôre not confident, start with a guided tour ‚Äî it‚Äôs safer and lets you learn the routes before going solo.
* Don‚Äôt ride at night. Seriously, it‚Äôs not worth it ‚Äî no lights, wandering animals, and unpredictable roads.

And if you want to plan something structured or get local help setting up a reliable ride, check out¬†[VietnameseMotorbikeTours.com](https://vietnamesemotorbiketours.com/)¬† they‚Äôve been organizing proper adventure rides from Hanoi to Saigon and know all the hidden backroads that most people miss.

So yeah, tourists¬†*can*¬†ride in Vietnam ‚Äî just do it smartly, respect local traffic flow, and you‚Äôll have one of the most unforgettable experiences of your life.",1,1759717387.0,VietnamQuestionAnswer,0,1.0,False

She doesn‚Äôt ever reach out to me but I also haven‚Äôt seen any evidence of her talking to other men. I‚Äôve reached out to her a couple times, the last text I sent asking to call her went unanswered and I snuck a message in a daily snap asking if she wanted to get coffee, where she answered but said she was too busy with exams and it wasn‚Äôt the best time.

I'd had bad motion sickness my whole life, but no history of migraines. Then boom, of all my chronic illnesses, this has oddly been my most terrifying. Vertigo and vestibular issues are so terrible and I wish none of us had them.

Now, 5 years later, I'd consider myself ~80% better most days. I thought I'd write a post with what has helped me the most in case it can help others; I am absolutely not a Dr or medical professional and wouldn't tell anyone the right or wrong thing to do, but I do know information like this gave me hope early on! I couldn't possibly cover everything here and am happy to answer questions; mods please let me know if anything isn't appropriate or needs changing.

Medication: vestibular system support, an abortive, and a prophylactic.
- Following research and suggestions from the book/work of Dr Beh, I began taking 400mg of magnesium glycinate and 400mg of B2 every day. I regularly have blood tests for my IBD so I can keep an eye on these levels anyway, but they definitely make a difference (after 2-3 months was when I noticed). My PPPD worsens and I'm generally more dizzy if I stop these. Ginger has also proved to take the edge off for me.
- The prescription medication that truly gave me my life back and moved me from chronic VM (constantly floating, walking on waves, dizzy, spinning, etc) to episodic VM was Pizotifen. Unfortunately as I understand it is not available in the US, but I'm outside the US and am very glad my neurologist suggested it. It makes me sleepy (take it at bedtime) and it has caused decent weight gain, but I was severely malnourished and underweight due to my IBD so I was actually glad for it. I'd also rather be less dizzy and need a bigger pair of pants tbh!
- I consider myself lucky that meclizine can take the edge off of the full vertigo-spins when I'm in a VM, however I'm still working to find a full abortive beyond lying in a dark quiet room and holding on for dear life.

Non-medication:
- Vestibular rehabilitation exercises; these can be found online, but I also was initially guided by a PT. These were more effective after I became episodic, but still helpful when I was chronic. I found them hard and scary but very slowly they showed they made a difference in my baseline.
- Migraine diet; I mostly no longer need this, but initially I trialed an elimination diet where I removed all the common migraine triggers from my diet and tried adding them back one by one. Citrus is still risky for me, and I still cannot do caffeine, much to my coffee-loving despair (I have made my peace with decaf, which I was able to tolerate after ~18 months). As someone who had an ED for a long time, maintaining a super restricted diet for me isn't a goal, rather finding if a specific food *is* a trigger was very helpful.
- Managing anxiety; this one sounds the most reductive and woo-woo, imo, as I hate that it has merit when so many patients are brushed off with ""it's just anxiety"". However I was able to coach my partner through some ear-infection-vertigo this year with my hard earned knowledge that anxiety, both acute and chronic, compound my symptoms. Rock Steady was helpful early on to get my head around this. If I panic, heart racing, tensing shoulders and jaw, cortisol, I get dizzier and more panicked and it's a viscious cycle. I've had to get myself through the terror of this to the point where now I can talk myself down by saying ""oh I'm spinning. Oh that sucks, blugh, gosh I don't want to throw up. I know it has stopped before, I know it can stop again. I know how to help myself here. I can figure this out"". 
- Taking it slow, taking it easy, and giving myself grace have been very important too. I've lost my academic trajectory and multiple jobs to this particular disease, and it's validly hellish, and I deserve to rest and heal. I now have a cane due to other issues, and it would have been quite useful to have when I felt worse as a sort of a ""tether"" to the earth! However I didn't feel I ""deserved"" that kind of aid. I had to learn that VM is *real* and it *sucks* and I deserve support.
- Doing ""normal life things"" when I feel up to it has also helped; the fluorescent lights and busy aisles of a store can send me over the edge, so I had to work up to it in increments. Small walks (even to the kitchen and back). Showing myself I can still do xyz while I'm dizzy, even if it's shorter etc than before, has showed my nervous system that I'll be okay. 

I am currently on extended medical leave and semi-housebound due to other illnesses I'm struggling to manage, but my VM and PPPD have become a smaller, back-seat portion of my issues now. I'll never go on a rollercoaster again, or turn around fast, or a number of other things I have grieved losing. However I can now drive, walk, use headphones, eat a variety of foods, sleep, work fulltime, go to busy markets, etc without my VM being triggered (though other illnesses will be). I'm now just ""blueb3lle is always a little dizzy and off-kilter"" and I'm happier with that than the initial nightmare it was. ",8,1759716862.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

1nz6w7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nz6w7o/the_hole_in_my_neighbors_roof_kept_growing/,The hole in my neighbor‚Äôs roof kept growing.,"I first noticed it during an early morning run. A blue tarp covered the opening, about ten by ten feet.

*Must be water damage.* I thought. *Maybe they need help.* 

I decided to stop by, see if they needed any assistance with the repairs.

The sound of scattered footsteps erupted from within as I knocked. I waited several seconds, then‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I said, putting on a gentle face. 

The man was middle-aged, perhaps fifty, with pepper-flecked hair and a trim beard. He had green eyes and an emaciated face. Other than his malnourished features, he seemed normal.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúName‚Äôs Tony.‚Äù I smiled and extended my hand. ‚ÄúI live just down the street.‚Äù

He stared at my palm with disgust. I stepped back, embarrassed.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help but notice you had a hole in your roof. I‚Äôd be happy to check it out. It‚Äôs supposed to rain next week.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for your concern, but I‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù 

He started to shut the door. 

‚ÄúWait. I run my own business.‚Äù I handed him my card. ‚ÄúIf you need repairs, I‚Äôm available. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúEugene,‚Äù he said, then shut the door. 

***

I stopped by Gladys‚Äô place the next morning. At seventy-eight years, she was our oldest resident. Aside from a few stray cats that lapped up tuna cans at her door, she was completely alone. 

‚ÄúYou doing okay, Gladys?‚Äù I asked, ducking into the kitchen. 

‚ÄúStill breathing,‚Äù she admitted.

I glanced out her kitchen window. Eugene‚Äôs house was across the street. The hole in his roof was larger. The blue tarp was attached to a green one, encompassing twenty by twenty feet. 

‚ÄúYou know anything about that house?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yes, the spooky place.‚Äù She adjusted her spectacles. ‚ÄúNever liked the man who lives there. Only comes out on rare occasions. In fact, I‚Äôve maybe seen him five times since he‚Äôs lived here.‚Äù

***

I continued on with my week. Each morning I‚Äôd go run, then head off to work. I had endless jobs piling up, and the daily exercise helped me de-stress.

I was so busy that it took me days to realize the hole on Eugene‚Äôs roof had quadrupled in size.

*What the hell?* I slowed to a trot. 

Sure enough, there were different colored tarps arranged all over the roof. It was like a fumigator had set up shop.

*He‚Äôs got a serious problem.* I mused. *How‚Äôs he going to take care of it?*

Call it OCD or curiosity, but I decided to stop by after work, bringing a cup of decaf coffee.¬†¬†

*If he doesn‚Äôt want to see me, at least he‚Äôll like this treat.* 

My stomach flip-flopped when I spotted Eugene out front, dressed in colorful robes and engaging in a violent dance. His movements were so erratic, he seemed to be participating in a macabre ritual. 

‚ÄúEugene?‚Äù I called out, slowing my walk to avoid startling him.

He stopped and turned, his face masked with a panicked expression.

‚ÄúIs everything‚Ä¶ alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, leave me alone.‚Äù

***

That night I stopped by Gladys‚Äô place, confusion etched onto my face. 

‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost, Tony.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I have‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought about what I had seen, sucked my front teeth. ‚ÄúI went by Eugene‚Äôs place. He was all dressed up. Doing this terrifying dance.‚Äù

Gladys‚Äô eyes clouded over. ‚ÄúHe was‚Ä¶ dancing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. And he seemed in pain.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet in,‚Äù Gladys said and pulled me forward. 

‚ÄúWait. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust get in and I‚Äôll tell you everything.‚Äù

***

The two of us sat at her table, peering over steaming cups of Earl Grey. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I haven‚Äôt been fully honest with you, Tony.‚Äù

I wiped sweat from my brow. *What could this sweet woman be so worried about?*

‚ÄúThat man‚Ä¶ at the house‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt just a random neighbor. He‚Äôs a spirit guide. It‚Äôs his job to keep evil beings away from our neighborhood.‚Äù

*Evil beings?* ‚ÄúAre you pulling my leg, Gladys?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeavens no!‚Äù She waved the comment aside. ‚ÄúDid you know that this entire county used to be indigenous land?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúWhen we drove the people out, something evil took their place.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike demons or‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHateful spirits. Every so often, one gets out. People like Eugene use their pain to keep them away.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt make any sense.‚Äù

Gladys pulled the sleeve of her shirt back to reveal hundreds of tiny cuts on her arm.

‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù I leapt back, bowling over my seat. ‚ÄúWhy are you showing me this?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause human suffering is the only thing that keeps them away. We all take turns harming ourselves. It‚Äôs a burden we bear in this community.‚Äù

I was so shaken. This gentle woman who had baked me cakes and shared stories about her grandchildren was unfolding a nightmarish story.¬†¬†

‚ÄúSo Eugene is scaring the spirits off.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe suffering dance is the final step in the process. The chosen undergoes a ritual of torment. At the end, they sacrifice themselves. I‚Äôm afraid tonight is the last time we‚Äôll see Eugene.‚Äù

I shrank back against the wall, in shock. 

‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù She stood, placed her hands on mine. ‚ÄúMost of our neighbors know about this. I wanted to tell you, but you‚Äôre so kind. I didn‚Äôt want to burden you.‚Äù

My breath shook as I stared into Gladys‚Äô eyes. I peeked over her shoulder to Eugene‚Äôs house. 

The lights were on. 

***

‚ÄúWait! Tony!‚Äù Gladys trailed me as I marched down the street. ‚ÄúIf you interrupt the session, everything will be lost!‚Äù

By now most of the neighbors had exited their homes. Some were aware of what I was doing. Others were as innocent as I was. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going toward the house!‚Äù A voice shouted. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him in!‚Äù

I increased my speed, ignoring everything. I had to put an end to this insanity. Hear from Eugene first-hand that this was a cruel joke pulled on the gullible neighbors.

By the time I reached his driveway, a large gathering had assembled behind me. 

‚ÄúTony!‚Äù It was Gladys, shaking. ‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt go in there.‚Äù

I looked at everyone. Their faces were worn and hardened. A few hands held guns. Some were pointed at me.

I backed away, raising my palms. ‚ÄúI just want to check on him‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then, the front door opened and something came out.

‚ÄúOh Jesus.‚Äù

It was Eugene. He was nude. Jagged cuts were all over his body. Strange symbols. Wretched diagrams. His eyes were hollow and his breathing faint. He took a few steps toward me, then collapsed. Dead.

‚ÄúThe sacrifice has been rejected!‚Äù Gladys screamed.

The most despairing, wretched sound emitted from the house. 

I turned, seeing‚Ä¶ something burst out from the tarped patchworks of the roof. Its body had spider-like limbs and jagged spines along its back. Two bat-like wings stretched out from what appeared to be shoulders.

‚ÄúOur judgment is upon us!‚Äù Gladys fell to her knees, praying.

In a burst of chaos, gunshots were fired. Voices begged. People screamed. I felt something lift me by my arms and haul me into the sky. 

It was the abomination from the roof. Soaring higher, clutching me in its crow-black talons. A gaping jaw full of yellow teeth grinned as a forked tongue smacked against my lips, smothering them in cat-like saliva.

‚ÄúTake it down!‚Äù¬†¬†

A gunshot rang out and the behemoth dropped me, screeching, as hot blood poured over my face.

***

When I woke up, I was lying in the street. Gladys‚Äô face was over mine. 

‚ÄúTony, you‚Äôre alive.‚Äù

I sat up. The entire neighborhood was gathered around me. Some familiar faces were missing. Others were bruised and bleeding. What had happened? 

‚ÄúThe spirits accepted their new guide,‚Äù Gladys croaked, downcast. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve agreed to let us live, as long as we continue our suffering.‚Äù

*Our suffering.* 

I glanced to where Eugene‚Äôs house used to be. The entire building and its surroundings were gone, like a bomb had been dropped on it, leaving only a crater.

A searing pain shot through my legs. I pulled up my left pant leg. A diagram of macabre sketches were marked into my flesh. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Tony,‚Äù Gladys sighed. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre the new vessel.‚Äù",3,1759716575.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1nz6v4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/MissedConnectionsYVR/comments/1nz6v4k/missed_connection_at_church/,Missed connection at church,"Date: Four weeks ago (Sunday service)
Location: Very right side, back two rows, Church

I noticed you the moment you sat down. Your golden blonde hair cascaded down your back like a wheat field blessed by heaven itself. The light reflecting from the stained carpet made it hard to tell, but it was BEAUTIFUL and FLOWING and very age-appropriate for church. Your sundress - was it yellow? It might have been white? I don't really know, because I was staring at your back nearly the entire church service.

Here‚Äôs where I need to be honest with you. I couldn‚Äôt see your face (you were facing forward the whole time, and I didn‚Äôt want to be weird and lean to the side), but I just KNOW you‚Äôre beautiful. I could feel it in my soul. When brushed your hair back falling across your back like a maple leaf falling in autumn, my heart skipped 2 or 3 beats.

But here‚Äôs the thing....and please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way because it comes from a place of PURE LOVE and MEDICAL CONCERN.

I noticed a mole on your back, near your left shoulder. It had irregular borders. I think. I am not so sure, because I was kind of mesmerized and was in a trance. I forgot to sing during worship time because I was first memorizing the back of your hair, then your back, and then I became very concerned about your skin health. Very concerned.

Back to your mole. I‚Äôm not a dermatologist YET (more on that in a moment), but I have spent approximately 14 hours on WebMD, the Mayo Clinic website, and watching the Seinfeld ""slight discolouration"" mole episode since that Sunday. I even signed up for the WebMD newsletter. The ABCDE rules of melanoma are nothing to mess with. Asymmetry. Border. Color. Diameter. Evolving. I couldn‚Äôt assess all of these from my vantage point, but what I saw kept me up for three consecutive nights. Could have been something I ate, but I still lay in bed thinking of you, the mole, and the Hallmark movie that could unfold between us.

Did you know that melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the US? Did you know that one American dies from melanoma every hour? I DO NOW. I‚Äôve basically become a mole expert. I‚Äôve watched 7 different YouTube videos by dermatologists and influencers, or at least they seemed like they were. I can now identify dysplastic nevi with moderate confidence. I‚Äôve been practicing on my own moles in the mirror.

In fact, since I saw your mole, I‚Äôm seriously considering going back to school to become a dermatologist. I know that‚Äôs 4 years of medical school plus 4 years of residency, but if it means I can properly assess your mole and the moles of our future children, isn‚Äôt that worth it? I‚Äôve already looked into MCAT prep courses. I scored pretty well on the untimed free practice test.

I‚Äôm imagining our future together: Our first date (dermatologist appointment, I‚Äôll hold your hand). Our second date (celebrating the benign biopsy results over Mexican (extra mole sauce of course). And then me brushing your golden hair while we watch Hallmark movies every night and I caress every contour of your back. Matching SPF 50 sunscreen in our medicine cabinet. Growing old together while being sun-aware.

I know this sounds crazy. DOESN'T IT? But when you know, you know. And I know. I didn‚Äôt even hear the sermon because I was too busy planning our life together and composing a mental health checklist for you. I may have been even producing an AI generated Hallmark-style trailer of our first encounter, meeting over coffee, and our future together

If this is you, please reach out. I promise I‚Äôm not weird - I‚Äôm just a man who believes in love at first sight (well, back at first sight) and preventative healthcare. Let‚Äôs get coffee. Or let‚Äôs go to a dermatologist. Or both?? We could bring the coffee TO the dermatologist???

I‚Äôll be sitting in the same spot next Sunday. And the Sunday after that. And every Sunday until I see you again.

Please be safe. Please get that mole checked. Please allow me be the one to drive you there.

-‚Äê‚Äî--------------------------------------------------------
Memory transcript subject: captain Ivan Kresinski, United Nations [standard human time]: July 17th 2160
‚Äî---------------------------------------------------------

I remember hearing about our attempt at first Contact and personally I hope that it's doing well I understand that my Co might not agree and his species might not agree entirely with the idea of uplifting a species when his species was treated like dirt but uplifting itself isn't entirely a terrible idea or at least it's in my opinion and most of humanities.

Anyway we were traveling through space and unobserved territory to make sure that a that we don't deal with any problems then be we're looking through some of the old archives and my co a Yotul badass Ronzo where from what I understand he fought in the major battle that destroyed the Federation even though sure that was 23 years ago I still respect him for that even though I am a young Captain comparison kind of funny that I kind of barely am older than the sentient Coalition itself but anyway

I say ‚ÄúAnything new any old Federation bases or contacts I understand we're in non-charted space but the Federation must have been around here because it's decently close by to the Kolshian Homeworld relatively speaking‚Äù

One of the sensor technicians Raya a Venlil where I look at her waiting for the responses and the fact that she's one of the first Venlil I meant that wasn't crippled or that honestly sounds bad but that's what most of them say anyway

 Raya says ‚ÄúCaptain I got some interesting notes from the Federation archive where it's one of the more hidden ones in the archive and also more information that we found in the information that we got from the shadow cast after the war where apparently thanks to the fact the encryption is a pain in the ass that basically the only way we're able to get rid of the encryption is to go closer to the system for some reason.‚Äù

Then something pops up on her screen and she opens it and says ‚Äúholy Fuck‚Äù her eyes nearly pop out of her skull and says captain I think I know why the shadow cast kept this a secret! 

I say ‚ÄúWhy did they keep a secret?‚Äù

Ronzo says ‚ÄúThis is not going to be good is it‚Äù he says drinking a drink of his coffee 

Raya says ‚ÄúThe shadow cast was literally in a war with a species in the background for ever since from what I'm understanding in let's see doing the math it was oh God this was before even the Arxur from what I understand if I'm using the calendar correctly it was 1776 was the year that they discovered this species where well I be damned they lied well probably not at first but this species had a similar reaction to my own‚Äù she says looking distraught

I get up and say ‚Äúhey hey calm down Federation is gone what do you mean the Federation lied?‚Äù

Raya says ‚ÄúThis species met the Kolshian in a equivalent technology level if we're using Earth as a benchmark around 1990s level technology but they very much put more emphasis on their space capability than you guys did but the species gonzai where there a amphibian mammal species similar to the Earth turtle actually very similar to the Earth turtle where honestly the only difference is that their eyes are facing forward and they are bipedal besides that they're about the size of an average Arxur in size and have a shell that apparently can take on bullet fire.‚Äù

I have my eyes pop out of my skull, a species before us and even the Arxur have been fighting the Federation for nearly 400 500 years if I'm doing my math right .

Ronzo says ‚ÄúSo that means two things they're the first predatory species they found and didn't realize it or they flat out lied‚Äù

I say ‚ÄúHow the f*** did they even fight the Kolshians for 400 500 years like how how is that possible‚Äù

Raya says ‚ÄúI don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know one thing I do know is is that they made the shadow Fleet piss their pants because they adapted quickly honestly I'm honestly surprised in a few aspects because well they didn't immediately go for antimatter because in the beginning they did basically try to get them to cooperate but after the natives realize what was happening that they fought back hard and one thing that kind of surprised me is that I'm honestly surprised the shadow cast didn't learn from them sure they probably learned a decent amount of experience but I'm surprised that they weren't completely destroyed how?‚Äù

I say let's watch the archive footage and what the Federation thought of them

[Footage starting starting
Archive researcher Philpo Kolshian researcher ‚Äú it's a outright disaster species 496 G is completely hostile to any attempt to cure to the point where any attempt to do anything similar to what we did a few hundred years ago to species 45g isn't working we're basically sterilizing them is well completely impossible when the fact that they're aggression and their technology is higher than expected to the point where they're shooting down shuttles and making it so it is impossible to reach the surface for the time being even though they do not have an infinite supply of missiles I doubt that is there only strategy for example on the ground when exterminators try to take some of them into re-education let's just say their shells are Sharp especially when 496 G or what they call themselves the gonzai basically make their shells sharp enough to cut through bone and basically a technique they use is basically when they have one of them be thrown at us like a spinning blade where it can cut through skin bone and also can get stuck in concrete and that's not the only use for their shells but going to see if re-education or curing is possible but I honestly think it's a possibility that we're going to need have the exterminators glass the planet.

Recording 9 weeks later

Shadow cast captain Gippy says to be honest these monsters are not the only thing on this planet they're Wildlife is even worse plus the gravity is significant worse not significantly so but well let's just say in my opinion everything on this planet is a predator that's the only way I could explain it when quite literally there are [20 meter tall] canine predators that even make the native sentient species nervous and other species on the planets that honestly make anything back on any other planet I've ever worked on look like a fruit walk. In the background a spider the size of a dog attacks one of the exterminators and rips their suit apart.]

I look at the footage of this planet and say ‚ÄúGod f****** damn it looks like they have quite literally made their Planet into a metaphorical Vietnam‚Äù

One of my crew say ‚ÄúHey Captain my great great-grandparents were not that bad he says in a Vietnamese accent ‚Äú

I say ‚ÄúXuan you and me both know you still have a bit of Pride for your ancestors on that I'm not going to stop you because honestly those wars were pointless but still everyone on this bridge gets the point the gonzai have made the Federation bleed blood after blood again and again and again we have to be careful if we go through their space actually we're about to.‚Äù

Immediately sensors immediately get a hail and also a weapons lock and I immediately answer the hail and the voice on the other line says ‚Äúunidentified vessel identify yourself or you will be turned into slag .‚Äù

I say ‚ÄúWe are the sentient Coalition vessel Phoenix we are not here to hurt you.‚Äù

The captain on the other end says ‚ÄúI have to ask you a simple question: are you with the squids?‚Äù

I immediately say ‚Äúno we are not with the Kolshian or Federation‚Äù

The captain on the other side immediately turns on face to face Communications and a crew and a captain of gonzai individuals are there and the captain says ‚ÄúDoes my appearance bother you he says looking angry‚Äù

I immediately say ‚ÄúNo, just the fact you look like turtles.‚Äù I say being a dumbass because my mouth and brain to mouth filter apparently doesn't want to work today

And the captain on the other side immediately has his face turned to confusion and most of the anger is gone and say‚Äù Say that again?

Ronzo says ‚ÄúOh Ralchi damn Ivan, what my captain meant to say is that no we do not have a problem with your appearance would you mind explaining how you were able to fight the Federation for half of Millenia 

The captain on the other side says ‚ÄúOh they didn't make it easy chemical weapons trying to cure us oh to the gods they refuse to leave us alone so we adapted we fought we endured I know that doesn't sound like much but let's just say the gonzai do not go down quietly and well one thing federation did was to unify my species against a common enemy where we refuse to be under the boot or tentacle of any species.‚Äù

I say ‚Äú I can be abundantly clear we will not attack you unless you attack us. We'd like to know more about your culture if we can.

I'd like to talk on neutral ground instead of doing it on coms?‚Äù

The captain on the other side says ‚Äúsure speaking of which my name is Vrit and as much as my crew is going to groan just as a ceremonial tradition of my people that the Federation tried to destroy do you mind carrying a ceremonial weapon if you do carry one because as a captain I want to restart an old tradition of the gonzai people that was nearly lost so how about this we both meet with three people from our ships three people you trust three people I propose four per ship to land on let's just say as a gesture of Goodwill let's have one shuttle of yours and one cell of ours connect so we can communicate on the moon of sapoth is that workable to you?‚Äù

I say to Vrit say ‚Äúthat is completely workable I would just like to have a small dialogue between us and possible dialogue between my government and your government and to reassure that the Federation has been dead for 23 years.‚Äù

As Vrit was taking a drink of something on his ship he spits it out and says ‚ÄúSo you're telling me the reason why they flat out disappeared one day 23 years ago was because the Federation fell how he says like it's something that he couldn't hope for even though he's been wanting it all his life or that's the intention of his words. ‚Äú

I say ‚ÄúThe Federation fell 23 years ago my species and sentient coalition destroyed the Federation and made sure they couldn't f****** the Galaxy ever again‚Äù

Vrit starts to cry and say ‚Äú23 years of Peace even though we never knew it 23 years of peace we thought they were just planning to kill us off permanently this time but they've been defunct for 23 years oh oh my to the five gods you're telling me that you destroyed the Federation okay that changes everything I'm going to be blunt with you you've gotten a whole lot of Goodwill because of that.‚Äù 

And he's not the only one crying most of his crew are crying especially individuals that look older where from the reports that the shadow cast was able to get is that the gonzai live for a long time in comparison to most species where on average they live more than three to four hundred years to possibly even longer the longest living individual of their species with the Technologies before the Federation theorized possibly 700 but well thanks to the over 400-500 Year .with the War their life spans have gotten less and less and less.

A few hours later we get in contact with the sentient coalition and the gonzai government and the fact that even though many members uncomfortable as I remember Ronzo and I having a conversation about the fact that they're going to have a warmer reception to the gonzai then the Bissems unfortunately just because the fact that the gonzai are omnivores not fully carnivores even though they're similar to humans and how much omnivorous they are.

 But anyway the gonzai very much are open to the idea of communicating with the sentient coalition where the fact that let's just say the gonzai very much respect the us humans wear sure we're not perfect where we make mistakes culturally speaking but we accept them for their culture unless it's unnecessary violence where there's differences of course but overall the sentient coalition even though it's bias see them as better than the Bissem even though it's an unspoken but I hope we can break through the Prejudice for both species.

Invincible sucks with Mark and Eve's relationship. With him and Amber they could not even get through one date but when Mark and Eve get together suddenly they're have all the time in the world and are together all the time. They started a fucking business together? I find that absolutely ridiculous.

1. Amber is okay with it which honestly is not fucking realistic. You are telling me that your friend starts dating your ex three months after u guys break up and you are just okay with it? You are even shipping it and 'wondered if they would get together after you broke up'. wtf??
2. No one else talking about it in the show is crazy. Not even William? How are u going to not call out your best friend for dating their exes friend so close to the time they broke up. Plus Mark saying his feelings for Eve never completely disappeared even when he was with amber. This was a high school crush compared to his long term relationship that spanned years. Your first time, your first love, your first everything, and you had feelings for someone else the whole time? Everyone was just okay with that?
3. Amber basically disappearing from the show after the break up. Like damn that's one way to tell us she is only useful as a love interest to break up with. She only appeared having coffee with Eve so they could make it canon that she was okay with Mark and Eve dating.
4. We did not see Mark mourning their relationship at all. I will reiterate this was his high school sweetheart and long term relationship. All we get is a scene of Mark looking down at Amber from the sky and then disappearing before she could see him. They just time skipped the period of him being upset over his ended relationship. They loved each other, the reason they broke up was Mark's secret identity as invincible. How are they not going to show him being even mildly sad over him and Amber after their break up scene and their flight scene.
5. Disposable Black Girlfriend Trope.
6. WTF?

Yes I understand the toxicity of dating a superhero displayed in their relationship, my points still stand.

I'm getting married in mid-December (in California) and then headed to England for my honeymoon and Bath is first. I arrive to town on a Monday mid-day and leave on Wednesday mid-day. What are some top recommended spots for coffee/breakfast, and any must-do attractions? I'll be staying at the Gainsborough so I will do the thermal waters there - should I also do the roman baths?

I make almost all my meals at home, from scratch, to ensure I get enough protein and nutrients, while eliminating excess sodium, preservatives etc. 
Around the same time, I stopped drinking and smoking and have taken various other steps to improve my overall health. 
I am extremely busy - I work a full time and am in school full time - and my free time is spent doing practical activities such as cooking and cleaning - with little leisure time. 
My partner of 1 year - is very different from me. They mainly eat take out, drink, smoke, etc. but then complain about low energy levels,  body dysmorphia, difficulties concentrating etc. 
I made a comment the other night, that although I love to cook, I feel that my efforts are under appreciated sometimes. 
My partner instantly said how much they love it when I cook etc (and they do always say thank you) but I tried to explain how it‚Äôs the working load of everything outside of the actual cooking process that I feel they take for granted. 
It turned into this massive fight - saying they will never eat my food again if it is such an issue. I just wanted not to feel ‚Äúobligated‚Äù to cook for the both of us all the time. 
They now will not eat anything I make - even if it‚Äôs just a pot of coffee. And if I try to bring it up again, and say I still want to cook for them / share my food - it‚Äôs turns into a fight and my partner won‚Äôt budge. ",0,1759716313.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False

1nz6nkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nz6nkn/id_only_been_overseas_on_business_for_two_weeks/,"I'd only been overseas on business for two weeks. When I got back, someone was in my home, painted to look like our cat, and my family couldn't tell the difference.","


*‚ÄúHey! Get the* ***fuck*** *off my son!‚Äù* I barked, storming towards our couch, suitcase falling from my grasp somewhere along the way.

Juli planted a firm hand on my chest as I tried to pass her and asked what *my* problem was. 

She insisted that I must be exhausted from the flight, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight, but I could feel the subtext. 

The insinuation was as plain as day. 

She thought I was ass-over-tits drunk - or worse - right in front of our son, something I‚Äôd promised never to be guilty of again.

Heat gathered under my shirt collar. A flush crept up my face.

I was sober.

Stone-cold sober.

Dry as a goddamn ditch.

I mean, *she* was the one who‚Äôd allowed that *freak* into our home. *She* was the one who was letting them lounge on our kid‚Äôs lap like nothing was wrong.

How did I know *she* wasn‚Äôt on something?

Wordlessly, I ripped Juli‚Äôs hand away and rushed past her.

*‚ÄúDad?! Dad, what‚Äôs the matter? It‚Äôs just Rajah, Dad!‚Äù*

Tears began flooding. It hurt to make Ike upset, yes, but that hurt was nothing compared to the fear I felt, the raw, blistering confusion of it all. It was the gentle sparks of a firecracker versus the roiling fireball of a ballistic missile. 

No contest.

I loomed over the brown leather sectional. Ike slid out from under *them* and scampered over the top of the couch, sprinting into his mother‚Äôs trembling arms as soon as his feet hit the floor.

The person dressed to look like our house cat didn‚Äôt even react.

Knees to their chest, curled and comfortable, they placed a painted, five-fingered hand up to their mouth and rubbed their palm against their mask. I suppose they were simulating self-cleaning, but the mask didn‚Äôt have a hole for a tongue to come out of, so their skin just squeaked against the material.

My eyelids twitched. Icy sweat drenched my back. I looked to my wife for answers, but she just seemed terrified.

Terrified of *me*.

*‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶what is this...?‚Äù* I whispered, knuckles collapsing into a fist.

Ike whimpered. My wife raked his beach blonde hair, silent, wide-eyed.

***‚ÄúWho is this Juli?‚Äù*** The dry, crackling scream sent her dashing to the kitchen table, where her phone was resting.

Ike transitioned into full-on hysteria.

And, very much like a cat, the intruder appeared perfectly indifferent to our mounting duress. 

They stopped faux-licking their palm and stretched wide, shifting their stomach towards me, unafraid, unbothered, unprotected.

I stared at them, disbelief running dizzy laps around the base of my skull.

They were around five feet tall, mask included, which was circular, stout, flattened at the top, triple the size of a human skull, and circumferentially smooth. The shape reminded me of the box I used to store drum cymbals. 

Our calico‚Äôs likeness had been painted across the mask. Her light green eyes. The black splotch surrounding her nose. The ragged edges of her left ear. To fit the mask‚Äôs bizarre dimensions, however, all those familiar features were slightly distorted.

Everything was a little *too* wide and a little *too* big. 

It was the same with their gaunt, emaciated body. 

They‚Äôd faithfully and meticulously translated the markings of her fur onto their skin, stretching the pattern to fit over their lanky proportions. 

A patch of white over their sunken, craterous abdomen. 

Speckles of soft orange along their forearms, extremities which had cords of tendon revoltingly visible because of the way their thin skin wrapped tightly around their fatless frame.

Worst of all, they were naked.

No genitals, though. The crease was sleek and seamless, like a Ken doll.

My rage boiled over.

I descended, ready to cave their chest in with my bare hands.

*‚Äú****Marvin - Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs just a cat. Get a hold of yourself!‚Äù*** Juli blared.

My fist halted inches from their breastbone. 

They didn‚Äôt flinch.

I creaked upright so I could see my wife‚Äôs eyes.

*‚ÄúYou think this‚Ä¶you think they‚Äôre a cat? You think* ***this*** *is Rajah?‚Äù*

Ike was beyond hysterics at that point, shrieking, inconsolable, face pressed hard into her pant leg.

Juli didn‚Äôt answer. 

She pulled Ike away, into another room, urgently muttering to the 9-1-1 dispatcher.

*‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶he‚Äôs on something, or drunk, or sick - I don‚Äôt know. Just get someone over here.‚Äù*

My mouth felt dry. I ran a quivering hand through my sweat-caked hair, slicking it back. Wanted to look somewhat presentable when the police arrived.

All the while, *they* loafed on the couch.

Sleeping? Smiling? Laughing? Watching? Waiting?

I couldn‚Äôt tell.

The mask had no holes, and they never spoke.

I stood in front of the couch, lightly swaying, an empty swing shivering in a cold wind, observing patches of painted skin sinking between their brittle ribs as they exhaled.

How can they breathe? - I wondered, given that the plastic edges of the mask seemed to be continuous with their neck. I was no closer to an answer to that question when the police arrived a few minutes later.

I implored them to arrest the intruder, begging them to see reason, praying their view matched my own.

They looked at the *thing* on my couch and snickered, eyes gleaming with amusement.

I shouldn‚Äôt have expected them to take the request seriously.

How could I?

It was just a cat, after all.

\- - - - - 

The police graciously escorted me to the emergency room.

Not in cuffs, thankfully. Not that time.

All the tests were unremarkable.

The clear fluid they drew from my spine didn‚Äôt show signs of an infection agitating my nervous system.

The urine drug screen came back positive, but only for opioids, and the doctor expected that, given I was on naltrexone. The med helped dull any residual cravings for my old vices - alcohol and cocaine - but shared a chemical similarity to oxycodone.

My kidneys, my heart, my liver: every organ seemed to be in working order.

Far as the doctor could tell, there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with me, and I hadn‚Äôt ingested anything they believed could inspire psychosis.

But when the psychiatrist asked, I remained insistent.

That *thing* wasn‚Äôt a cat.

From there, my trajectory was set.

Next stop: *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*

The first time wasn‚Äôt too bad. My fellow captives were tolerable, and the docs were nice enough. Smart, too. They eventually had me believing I was suffering under an *‚Äúisolated delusion precipitated by extreme stress‚Äù*. Their words, not mine.

Initially, I rejected the theory. 

The more I considered it, though, the more it seemed to click into place.

Undeniably, work had been taxing, and no one else saw Rajah as I did. Occam‚Äôs Razor suggested something was wrong with *me,* rather than everyone else. Not Ike, not Juli, and not the police.

Just me.

\- - - - - 

Five days later, I was discharged.

Ike was ecstatic, jumping up and down in the back seat of our sedan, wrapping a pair of little hands around my shoulders as I clicked the passenger seat safety belt into the holster. Juli was more reticent about my release, but she did a good job faking happiness for Ike‚Äôs sake.

I was the last to enter when we got home.

My feet felt thickly calcified to our stone stoop. It took Juli holding my hand to get me inside, practically yanking me over the threshold.

The door swung shut behind me. 

Electricity sizzled up the curves of my neck as I scanned my surroundings. Juli ran her thumb delicately across my palm. The massage was tender and affectionate, but I sensed a similar electricity hissing along her skin. She was nervous too, and in retrospect, she had every right to be.

I saw no masked intruder.

My static calmed. I turned to Juli and shot her a flimsy smile.

Then, there was a noise above us.

A quiet, inscrutable message.

A painful reminder.

*Knock.* 

*Knock.* 

*Knock.*

My body became a live-wire. Juli‚Äôs thumb dug vicious stigmata into my palm, having sensed my panic.

I glanced up, and there *they* were.

Lying prone on the balcony that overlooked our foyer, all but their mask wreathed in deep shadow, knocking the poor, oversized facsimile of Rajah‚Äôs skull against the bannister‚Äôs small wooden pillars, alternating left to right, right to left, left to right.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

The lead psychiatrist at *‚ÄúFalling Leaves‚Äù* informed me I went absolutely ballistic at the mere sight of our innocent house cat, and that my stay the second time around would be longer.

Much longer.

I don‚Äôt recall going ballistic, though. 

I have no memory of what transpired between seeing *them* again and the point at which I arrived at the psychiatric hospital.

All I remember is their terrible, pendulous sway, extending on into infinity. A video on a frozen computer screen, constantly refreshing but never righting itself, never moving on, perpetually misaligned and distorted.

A part of me never left that moment.

A part of me is still there, watching, helpless.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

\- - - - - 

Juli still visited me over the following three months, but only weekly, and she wasn‚Äôt bringing Ike with her. Not only that, but judging by the way her cheekbones had begun progressively sharpening, she wasn‚Äôt eating. The stress of it all was getting to her, and that fact killed me.

At first, I pleaded.

Said things like:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not insane!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI know what I saw!‚Äù*

and

*‚ÄúFor the love of God, Juli, you and Ike aren‚Äôt safe!‚Äù*.

All she did in response was avert her gaze.

My pleas were falling on deaf ears, and the only thing those outbursts were earning me was a longer sentence at *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*.

It was a tough pill to swallow, but I realized that feigning recovery from my *‚Äúdelusion‚Äù* was the most logical step forward. 

So, that‚Äôs what I did. 

Slowly but surely, I ‚Äú*recovered‚Äù*. Even endorsed during a group therapy session that I‚Äôd been covertly indulging in some designer, PCP-like drugs. Drugs that wouldn‚Äôt come up on a routine test, but certainly could send a mind through the proverbial garbage disposal. 

The psychiatrist seemed to buy it - hook, line and sinker.

One-hundred and eight grueling days later, my wife brought me home.

Her lips twitched as she drove. Her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. She‚Äôd lost a significant amount of weight - twenty pounds, maybe more.

*They* were right inside the door when I opened it.

Preening on their back beside our welcome mat, body contorted into a lazy stretch, silently beseeching a stomach scratch.

I watched her anxiety flourish into outright panic, knees fluttering, breathing sharp and shallow. Her eyes flashed to me, then to what she saw as our defenseless cat, and back again, petrified about what I might do.

Before she could pull her phone from her bag, I was bending down, rubbing my fingers against *their* belly. Its skin was doughy but disturbingly coarse, like partially congealed flour with grains of asphalt mixed into the batter.

As I suppressed a gag, I felt the silky touch of Juli‚Äôs hand on my shoulder.

*‚ÄúSo good to have you back, Marvin,‚Äù* she whispered.

I nodded, still rubbing; the dead eyes of their painted mask pointed at me.

Juli walked away. As soon as she was out of earshot, I stood up and retracted my hand, which was now coated in a fine, gray, odorless dust. 

Something was different about *them*.

Their abdomen seemed fuller than before.

\- - - - - 

The solution to this mess, as I imagined it, appeared relatively straightforward.

I didn‚Äôt need to understand *them*.

I didn‚Äôt need to know what they were, why only I could appreciate their true form, and what their purpose in my home was.

I just needed to kill *them*.

Thus, I needed my family incapacitated, unable to intervene.

So I dosed them.

One milligram of Lorazepam for Ike, four milligrams of Lorazepam for Juli.

For the record, benzodiazepines were never my vice. I mean, who wants to sleep through their high? Never made much sense to me. Still, I had use for them outside of hedonism as a sort of biochemical kill-switch.

Having the shakes from alcohol withdrawal? Take a Lorazepam.

Coke got you a little too revved up? Take a Lorazepam.

Thankfully, I was able to locate a dusty pill bottle stashed under a floorboard in the attic: a relic from my days as a fiend.

It wasn‚Äôt as dramatic as something like chloroform. They both just became incredibly drowsy after downing some spiked lemonade, neither very interested in having leftovers prior to turning in for the evening. I helped them up the stairs, and that was that. Both were out like a light in no time.

Ike told me he loved me.

Juli reminded me to feed Rajah. Three times.

She might have her suspicions in the morning, and I figured she‚Äôd be distraught to find *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* missing, but I‚Äôd cross that bridge when I came to it. 

As I drew Ike‚Äôs bedroom door closed, there *they* were.

Lying on their belly in the hallway, absentmindedly flicking water around their bowl with their seemingly nailless, human fingers.

That moment was the first pleasurable one I‚Äôd experienced since the whole damn ordeal began.

They were making it easy for me.

I tiptoed across the carpet, gaze ripe with beautiful violence, and when I was close enough, I knelt down and straddled the intruder. 

They writhed, attempting to get out from under me.

It was no use.

Only then did I experience a brief, smoldering curiosity about what was hidden beneath.

I clasped my hands at the point where its mask and neck became indistinguishable, and began wrenching it upwards. A deluge of endorphins set my blood on fire. My entire body radiated blissful warmth.

This fever dream was finally going to be over.

When the mask started to give, as threads of anchoring sinew started to snap, that‚Äôs when I heard their howls.

Both Juli and Ike, wailing in discordant unity.

Paternal instinct got me upright.

Before my conscious mind could even register the circumstances, I was kneeling beside my son.

He was sitting straight up, shoulders tensed to hell and back, eyes rolled into his skull, and, God, there was blood. Tiny crimson dewdrops formed a ring around his neck, *exactly* where I‚Äôd been tearing at the mask.

His screams grew fainter.

After a few seconds, he fell back limply onto his pillow, almost as if he‚Äôd passed out from within a dream. Only then did the wails completely die out.

Then, the house was utterly silent. Juli had stopped too.

Whatever I did *them,* it seemed to translate to my family. They were connected. Tethered.

I turned around, nearly toppling back onto Ike from the shock of what I saw.

*They* were there. In the doorway.

Standing on two feet.

Rajah‚Äôs stretched, vacant face stared daggers into me.

Gradually, it got back on all fours, pawed past me, climbed onto Ike‚Äôs bed, and curled up at his feet.

And I just stood there, paralyzed.

The message was obvious. They didn‚Äôt need a voice for me to understand.

*‚ÄúCheckmate.‚Äù*

\- - - - - 

The next morning, as I stewed over a mug of lukewarm coffee at the kitchen table, Juli approached me holding her pillowcase.

*‚ÄúHey! Glad to see you up so early.‚Äù*

I nodded, keeping my eyes fixed on the black liquid.

*‚ÄúWhat do you make of these stains? Smells a hell of a lot like blood, and it wasn‚Äôt there before I went to bed. I thought I saw some dried blood on my neck, but I looked myself up and down in the mirror and it doesn‚Äôt seem like I have a scratch on me. I don‚Äôt know; it‚Äôs just weird.‚Äù*

She dropped the pillowcase onto the table and returned to her morning routine. A blotchy, maroon-colored oval marred the light blue fabric, no bigger than a quarter. Flecks of coagulation dislodged as I scraped my thumbnail over the stain, but as I put it to my nose and sniffed, I didn‚Äôt detect even a hint of that sickly sweet, iron-kissed scent.

*‚ÄúHmm. Yup, smells like blood to me. Strange,‚Äù* I replied, draping the pillowcase over the top of a nearby chair.

*‚ÄúRight?‚Äù* She paced out into the foyer and began calling for Ike.

After years of snorting cocaine, my sense of smell was effectively nonexistent. Rarely, I‚Äôd get a faint whiff of something, but it‚Äôd have to be exceptionally fragrant to wake up my fried nerves, and it was always fleeting.

Juli didn‚Äôt know that, though. I was used to lying about it, too embarrassed to reveal the lengths to which I‚Äôd ravaged my body at the altar of *feeling good*.

My eyes darted to the pantry. 

There was a muffled tapping coming from the inside. The clack of my wife‚Äôs heels echoed as she moved to open the door.

The intruder spilled out, mask thudding against the floor, cans of beans and boxes of spaghetti toppling over like bowling pins.

*‚ÄúRajah, you goof, there you are,‚Äù* Juli cooed.

They got on all fours and began shaking violently, airing out their hypothetical fur, causing a cloud of pale dust to collect around them. Once settled, they tilted their mask up to *‚Äúlook‚Äù* at my wife.

She stared back at them, silent, grinning. After a moment, she turned to me and said:

*‚ÄúWow! He is vocal today, good Lord.‚Äù*

At no point did I hear *anything* from *them*.

Juli paced out of the kitchen, chuckling to herself.

I glared at the intruder. They had everyone else fooled, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to pinpoint what made me so damn special.

Suddenly, I had an idea.

What if something in my blood was allowing me to see through the illusion? 

Could I be genetically immune? 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, walked up to *them*, and snapped a quick picture.

Then, I texted my brother.

*‚ÄúFree for dinner tonight? Ike would love to see his uncle.‚Äù*

Dan and I weren‚Äôt estranged, but we weren‚Äôt on great terms, either. He lived about an hour away and had his own shit to deal with. More than that, though, I‚Äôd said some things better left unsaid while still in the throes of substance abuse. He‚Äôd kept me at arm‚Äôs length ever since.

I towered over the indecipherable devil, the haunting melody of my spellbound wife and son laughing upstairs thumping against my eardrums.

My hand buzzed.

*‚ÄúSure. Good to hear from you. Cars out of commission - mind picking me up?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHappy to.‚Äù* I replied.

Then, with no context, I forwarded him the picture I‚Äôd just taken, and waited.

The dots of a pending reply appeared across my phone screen. My heart racketed around my ribcage.

My life teetered on what he saw.

*‚ÄúEww. What the fuck is that, Marv?‚Äù*

Relief washed over me.

*‚ÄúTell you more later. Be there at 5.‚Äù*

I peered down at *them* and smiled wide, baring my teeth.

\- - - - - 

Most of the trip home from Dan‚Äôs was silent. I was too nervous to hold a conversation, manically tapping on the steering wheel, thoughts spinning.

As we were pulling off the interstate, he broke that silence, but not in the way I was expecting.

*‚ÄúHey, you haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶taken anything, right? Still on the wagon, so to speak?‚Äù* he asked.

Automatically, I responded:

*‚ÄúWhat? No. God, I wish.‚Äù* Each small word came out swift and punctuated.

Even with just my peripheral vision, I could tell he was giving me *that* look. A pitying condescension that always felt like a splash of acid gnawing at my skin. The type of look that used to reliably throw me into a rage at a moment‚Äôs notice.

I swallowed and rolled my shoulders. Focused my attention on the heat from the setting sun cascading through the windshield, rather than the resentment sizzling in my veins.

*‚ÄúThings at home have been better,‚Äù* I sighed.

Talk about an understatement, but what else could I say? Where would I even start?

I lost my job?

I was in a psychiatric hospital for months?

There‚Äôs a demon eunuch dressed as my house cat, and only I can tell? 

No.

He‚Äôd think I‚Äôd gone off the deep end.

Once he saw it for himself, then I‚Äôd be able to spill my guts. Once he understood, then we could strategize. 

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as bad as you - ‚Äú*

He paused, sniffing the air. A bout of harsh, vigorous coughing took hold of him. His eyes became glassy and red.

I considered pulling over by our town‚Äôs welcome sign, but he waved for me to keep going as I flicked my turn signal on.

*‚ÄúSorry - ‚Äú* he sputtered. *‚ÄúAllergies really have been a bitch this year.‚Äù*

The fit abruptly dissipated. When I looked over, he didn't seem concerned, and his breathing was steady, so I just kept going.  

A minute later, we pulled into my driveway.

He asked one last question as we walked up to the stoop, the final glimmers of orange twilight fading away above our heads.

*‚ÄúOh! Almost forgot - what the hell was that picture you sent me? Shit was cursed. Nearly fell out of my chair when it popped up,‚Äù* he chuckled.

I pretended not to hear him and opened the front door.

\- - - - - 

Hours passed before dinner was ready. 

We chatted, gave Dan copious updates about Ike, and even had time to play a few games of backgammon while the roast cooked. He continued to cough, but the fits were smaller, more contained. Honestly, he didn't even seem to notice them. 

All the while, *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* never showed their face. Dread crawled over my skin like termites through wood, but I kept my cool.

*They‚Äôd* come.

Around eight, the four of us sat down to eat. Lines of steam rose above the glistening pile of meat at the center of the table. Ike, wanting to come off as a proper gentleman, insisted on serving us, dropping asymmetric portions of beef, mashed potatoes, and baked asparagus across each of our plates.

*‚ÄúAlright! Dig in.‚Äù* Juli announced.

My son descended ravenously. Still on edge, I gingerly mixed the gravy into the potatoes, eyes darting between each of the three entrances to our kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed something peculiar about Juli.

She was holding her utensils upright - a fork in one hand, a knife in the other - but she wasn‚Äôt moving, eyes locked on me but glazed over.

*‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶everything OK?‚Äù*

The only part of her that budged was her lips.

*‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù* 

Stomach twisting into agonizing knots, I turned to Dan.

He was swiping at the meal, but every time, his fork missed. 

A little too high. A little too far left. 

Over and over and over again.

*‚ÄúJuli, this turkey is something else,‚Äù* he muttered.

Something was desperately wrong.

Abruptly, my wife released her grip, utensils clattering against the plate.

*‚ÄúWow, I am stuffed!‚Äù* she proclaimed.

Juli sprang from her chair.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers.‚Äù*

She balled her hand into a fist, brought it close to her face, and began knocking on her forehead.

The resulting sound had an unnaturally pervasive resonance, like hot water running through a loose copper pipe, metal expanding and colliding against a nearby wall. 

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

A series of wild thuds emanated from the foyer; a bevy of hands and feet and knees crashing down the stairs.

The frenzied stampede of a starving animal.

As the masked intruder charged into the room, Juli walked over to his dinner bowl and dumped the entire meal into it, pieces haphazardly ricocheting onto the side of a cabinet and the surrounding floor.

Suddenly, I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen her eat *anything* substantial since I left for that trip months prior. A few slices of toast with her coffee the morning, but nothing more.

Dan pivoted to face *them* as they entered.

I held my breath.

He swung to me.

His eyes were rolled back into his skull - white balls of tapioca adorned with a latticework of bright capillaries, tiny red worms wading through a thick ooze.

*‚ÄúI was wondering when the little guy would show up. I‚Äôve missed him!‚Äù*

My heart buckled. My mind fractured.

Identically, my brother sprung to his feet, grabbed his plate, and dumped it in front of *them*.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers! Pets have to be fed, and we don‚Äôt want Ike to be the one to feed them, right? No, of course not. We want the best for our prodigy. We want them to grow. We want to thrive. Right? Right?‚Äù*

The intruder hastily gathered the tribute into their arms, gravy smearing an impromptu Rorschach test along their trunk, and then began galloping past the table. At some point, Ike had gotten up and was standing by the screen door, creaking it open so they could careen into the backyard without losing an ounce of momentum.

For months, this had been the routine. 

Looking at Ike, I found myself at a crossroads.

I could just give up.

Allow my family to be eaten away from the inside out, until there was nothing left, until they‚Äôd been made hollow.

Hell, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard, and who knows?

Weak and empty, they might not even have the brain power to notice if indulged in a vice or two on the side. A family that would stick around no matter what I did to myself.

I wanted that at some point, right?

Or, I could give chase to that incomprehensible *thing*, that fucking parasite.

Even if it felt hopeless, completely and utterly insurmountable,

I could still try.

Blood thrumming, heart burning,

I shot up and followed *them* into the moonless night.

\- - - - - 

It‚Äôs currently 11 PM.

When I finally arrived home, Ike and Juli were sleeping soundly, and Dan was gone.

But I don‚Äôt know where he got to, since I drove him.

There are‚Ä¶holes in the forest. Burrows. Tunnels.

I watched the intruder dive into one, still holding the food.

When I put my ear to the hole, I heard something.

Mewing.

Multiple identical, high-pitched yowls, overlaid with each other. Sounded *exactly* like Rajah when we forgot to fill his bowl. Hungry begging, but in eerie triplicate.

I never considered what happened to the *real* him until that moment.

If that is truly our original house cat, deep in the hole.

That‚Äôs not all, though.

On the way back, I passed by Mr. Hooper. He lives two doors down from us.

He was walking what he *believed* was his husky.

The man looked like he‚Äôd dropped thirty pounds since I last saw him.

It‚Äôs not just happening to my family.

I think the whole town is infested.

\- - - - - 

Not sure what to do next.

Search for Dan? Return to the hole?

It‚Äôs unclear, but I‚Äôll figure it out.

I‚Äôm publishing this in case something happens to me.

Juli, if you‚Äôre reading this, 

I‚Äôm not crazy.

I love you.

I am a nerdy, tall, fit, and hopefully charming teacher looking to connect and find romance through characters that I hope we can build together. 

My prompt idea is this: we had been friends for years; almost having a second language just the two of us could understand. Yet nothing ever happened. It was just that; friendship. You had been dating someone as long as I‚Äôd known you so in my mind you were always not that way. We would have coffee dates, study sessions, dance under the stars; and yet no kiss, no cuddles, just friendship. Eventually I moved on and found someone as well. We both ended up with others and yet remained close. It made sense as we had countless memories, inside jokes, and a set of memes meant just for us. Slowly though things changed. Our relationships weren‚Äôt what we thought they would be. Neither were our people. Yet you still rattled around in my head and remained in my life. The one that was always there; the one that got me. 

So how do things change? I would love you to build that with me. How do we slowly escalate as a romance builds long term where just a friendship once was. 

I look for putting part of ourselves in characters. I enjoy building a connection and relationship long term. I would like to slowly build romance over time.

So if that sounds like you I would love to find a long term partner to build this with. We can change this to be childhood friends from the same hometown, college friends that met in relationships, or high school best friends.

1nz6n1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nz6n1o/id_only_been_overseas_on_business_for_two_weeks/,"I'd only been overseas on business for two weeks. When I got back, someone was in my home, painted to look like our cat, and my family couldn't tell the difference.","

*‚ÄúHey! Get the* ***fuck*** *off my son!‚Äù* I barked, storming towards our couch, suitcase falling from my grasp somewhere along the way.

Juli planted a firm hand on my chest as I tried to pass her and asked what *my* problem was. 

She insisted that I must be exhausted from the flight, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight, but I could feel the subtext. 

The insinuation was as plain as day. 

She thought I was ass-over-tits drunk - or worse - right in front of our son, something I‚Äôd promised never to be guilty of again.

Heat gathered under my shirt collar. A flush crept up my face.

I was sober.

Stone-cold sober.

Dry as a goddamn ditch.

I mean, *she* was the one who‚Äôd allowed that *freak* into our home. *She* was the one who was letting them lounge on our kid‚Äôs lap like nothing was wrong.

How did I know *she* wasn‚Äôt on something?

Wordlessly, I ripped Juli‚Äôs hand away and rushed past her.

*‚ÄúDad?! Dad, what‚Äôs the matter? It‚Äôs just Rajah, Dad!‚Äù*

Tears began flooding. It hurt to make Ike upset, yes, but that hurt was nothing compared to the fear I felt, the raw, blistering confusion of it all. It was the gentle sparks of a firecracker versus the roiling fireball of a ballistic missile. 

No contest.

I loomed over the brown leather sectional. Ike slid out from under *them* and scampered over the top of the couch, sprinting into his mother‚Äôs trembling arms as soon as his feet hit the floor.

The person dressed to look like our house cat didn‚Äôt even react.

Knees to their chest, curled and comfortable, they placed a painted, five-fingered hand up to their mouth and rubbed their palm against their mask. I suppose they were simulating self-cleaning, but the mask didn‚Äôt have a hole for a tongue to come out of, so their skin just squeaked against the material.

My eyelids twitched. Icy sweat drenched my back. I looked to my wife for answers, but she just seemed terrified.

Terrified of *me*.

*‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶what is this...?‚Äù* I whispered, knuckles collapsing into a fist.

Ike whimpered. My wife raked his beach blonde hair, silent, wide-eyed.

***‚ÄúWho is this Juli?‚Äù*** The dry, crackling scream sent her dashing to the kitchen table, where her phone was resting.

Ike transitioned into full-on hysteria.

And, very much like a cat, the intruder appeared perfectly indifferent to our mounting duress. 

They stopped faux-licking their palm and stretched wide, shifting their stomach towards me, unafraid, unbothered, unprotected.

I stared at them, disbelief running dizzy laps around the base of my skull.

They were around five feet tall, mask included, which was circular, stout, flattened at the top, triple the size of a human skull, and circumferentially smooth. The shape reminded me of the box I used to store drum cymbals. 

Our calico‚Äôs likeness had been painted across the mask. Her light green eyes. The black splotch surrounding her nose. The ragged edges of her left ear. To fit the mask‚Äôs bizarre dimensions, however, all those familiar features were slightly distorted.

Everything was a little *too* wide and a little *too* big. 

It was the same with their gaunt, emaciated body. 

They‚Äôd faithfully and meticulously translated the markings of her fur onto their skin, stretching the pattern to fit over their lanky proportions. 

A patch of white over their sunken, craterous abdomen. 

Speckles of soft orange along their forearms, extremities which had cords of tendon revoltingly visible because of the way their thin skin wrapped tightly around their fatless frame.

Worst of all, they were naked.

No genitals, though. The crease was sleek and seamless, like a Ken doll.

My rage boiled over.

I descended, ready to cave their chest in with my bare hands.

*‚Äú****Marvin - Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs just a cat. Get a hold of yourself!‚Äù*** Juli blared.

My fist halted inches from their breastbone. 

They didn‚Äôt flinch.

I creaked upright so I could see my wife‚Äôs eyes.

*‚ÄúYou think this‚Ä¶you think they‚Äôre a cat? You think* ***this*** *is Rajah?‚Äù*

Ike was beyond hysterics at that point, shrieking, inconsolable, face pressed hard into her pant leg.

Juli didn‚Äôt answer. 

She pulled Ike away, into another room, urgently muttering to the 9-1-1 dispatcher.

*‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶he‚Äôs on something, or drunk, or sick - I don‚Äôt know. Just get someone over here.‚Äù*

My mouth felt dry. I ran a quivering hand through my sweat-caked hair, slicking it back. Wanted to look somewhat presentable when the police arrived.

All the while, *they* loafed on the couch.

Sleeping? Smiling? Laughing? Watching? Waiting?

I couldn‚Äôt tell.

The mask had no holes, and they never spoke.

I stood in front of the couch, lightly swaying, an empty swing shivering in a cold wind, observing patches of painted skin sinking between their brittle ribs as they exhaled.

How can they breathe? - I wondered, given that the plastic edges of the mask seemed to be continuous with their neck. I was no closer to an answer to that question when the police arrived a few minutes later.

I implored them to arrest the intruder, begging them to see reason, praying their view matched my own.

They looked at the *thing* on my couch and snickered, eyes gleaming with amusement.

I shouldn‚Äôt have expected them to take the request seriously.

How could I?

It was just a cat, after all.

\- - - - - 

The police graciously escorted me to the emergency room.

Not in cuffs, thankfully. Not that time.

All the tests were unremarkable.

The clear fluid they drew from my spine didn‚Äôt show signs of an infection agitating my nervous system.

The urine drug screen came back positive, but only for opioids, and the doctor expected that, given I was on naltrexone. The med helped dull any residual cravings for my old vices - alcohol and cocaine - but shared a chemical similarity to oxycodone.

My kidneys, my heart, my liver: every organ seemed to be in working order.

Far as the doctor could tell, there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with me, and I hadn‚Äôt ingested anything they believed could inspire psychosis.

But when the psychiatrist asked, I remained insistent.

That *thing* wasn‚Äôt a cat.

From there, my trajectory was set.

Next stop: *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*

The first time wasn‚Äôt too bad. My fellow captives were tolerable, and the docs were nice enough. Smart, too. They eventually had me believing I was suffering under an *‚Äúisolated delusion precipitated by extreme stress‚Äù*. Their words, not mine.

Initially, I rejected the theory. 

The more I considered it, though, the more it seemed to click into place.

Undeniably, work had been taxing, and no one else saw Rajah as I did. Occam‚Äôs Razor suggested something was wrong with *me,* rather than everyone else. Not Ike, not Juli, and not the police.

Just me.

\- - - - - 

Five days later, I was discharged.

Ike was ecstatic, jumping up and down in the back seat of our sedan, wrapping a pair of little hands around my shoulders as I clicked the passenger seat safety belt into the holster. Juli was more reticent about my release, but she did a good job faking happiness for Ike‚Äôs sake.

I was the last to enter when we got home.

My feet felt thickly calcified to our stone stoop. It took Juli holding my hand to get me inside, practically yanking me over the threshold.

The door swung shut behind me. 

Electricity sizzled up the curves of my neck as I scanned my surroundings. Juli ran her thumb delicately across my palm. The massage was tender and affectionate, but I sensed a similar electricity hissing along her skin. She was nervous too, and in retrospect, she had every right to be.

I saw no masked intruder.

My static calmed. I turned to Juli and shot her a flimsy smile.

Then, there was a noise above us.

A quiet, inscrutable message.

A painful reminder.

*Knock.* 

*Knock.* 

*Knock.*

My body became a live-wire. Juli‚Äôs thumb dug vicious stigmata into my palm, having sensed my panic.

I glanced up, and there *they* were.

Lying prone on the balcony that overlooked our foyer, all but their mask wreathed in deep shadow, knocking the poor, oversized facsimile of Rajah‚Äôs skull against the bannister‚Äôs small wooden pillars, alternating left to right, right to left, left to right.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

The lead psychiatrist at *‚ÄúFalling Leaves‚Äù* informed me I went absolutely ballistic at the mere sight of our innocent house cat, and that my stay the second time around would be longer.

Much longer.

I don‚Äôt recall going ballistic, though. 

I have no memory of what transpired between seeing *them* again and the point at which I arrived at the psychiatric hospital.

All I remember is their terrible, pendulous sway, extending on into infinity. A video on a frozen computer screen, constantly refreshing but never righting itself, never moving on, perpetually misaligned and distorted.

A part of me never left that moment.

A part of me is still there, watching, helpless.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

\- - - - - 

Juli still visited me over the following three months, but only weekly, and she wasn‚Äôt bringing Ike with her. Not only that, but judging by the way her cheekbones had begun progressively sharpening, she wasn‚Äôt eating. The stress of it all was getting to her, and that fact killed me.

At first, I pleaded.

Said things like:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not insane!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI know what I saw!‚Äù*

and

*‚ÄúFor the love of God, Juli, you and Ike aren‚Äôt safe!‚Äù*.

All she did in response was avert her gaze.

My pleas were falling on deaf ears, and the only thing those outbursts were earning me was a longer sentence at *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*.

It was a tough pill to swallow, but I realized that feigning recovery from my *‚Äúdelusion‚Äù* was the most logical step forward. 

So, that‚Äôs what I did. 

Slowly but surely, I ‚Äú*recovered‚Äù*. Even endorsed during a group therapy session that I‚Äôd been covertly indulging in some designer, PCP-like drugs. Drugs that wouldn‚Äôt come up on a routine test, but certainly could send a mind through the proverbial garbage disposal. 

The psychiatrist seemed to buy it - hook, line and sinker.

One-hundred and eight grueling days later, my wife brought me home.

Her lips twitched as she drove. Her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. She‚Äôd lost a significant amount of weight - twenty pounds, maybe more.

*They* were right inside the door when I opened it.

Preening on their back beside our welcome mat, body contorted into a lazy stretch, silently beseeching a stomach scratch.

I watched her anxiety flourish into outright panic, knees fluttering, breathing sharp and shallow. Her eyes flashed to me, then to what she saw as our defenseless cat, and back again, petrified about what I might do.

Before she could pull her phone from her bag, I was bending down, rubbing my fingers against *their* belly. Its skin was doughy but disturbingly coarse, like partially congealed flour with grains of asphalt mixed into the batter.

As I suppressed a gag, I felt the silky touch of Juli‚Äôs hand on my shoulder.

*‚ÄúSo good to have you back, Marvin,‚Äù* she whispered.

I nodded, still rubbing; the dead eyes of their painted mask pointed at me.

Juli walked away. As soon as she was out of earshot, I stood up and retracted my hand, which was now coated in a fine, gray, odorless dust. 

Something was different about *them*.

Their abdomen seemed fuller than before.

\- - - - - 

The solution to this mess, as I imagined it, appeared relatively straightforward.

I didn‚Äôt need to understand *them*.

I didn‚Äôt need to know what they were, why only I could appreciate their true form, and what their purpose in my home was.

I just needed to kill *them*.

Thus, I needed my family incapacitated, unable to intervene.

So I dosed them.

One milligram of Lorazepam for Ike, four milligrams of Lorazepam for Juli.

For the record, benzodiazepines were never my vice. I mean, who wants to sleep through their high? Never made much sense to me. Still, I had use for them outside of hedonism as a sort of biochemical kill-switch.

Having the shakes from alcohol withdrawal? Take a Lorazepam.

Coke got you a little too revved up? Take a Lorazepam.

Thankfully, I was able to locate a dusty pill bottle stashed under a floorboard in the attic: a relic from my days as a fiend.

It wasn‚Äôt as dramatic as something like chloroform. They both just became incredibly drowsy after downing some spiked lemonade, neither very interested in having leftovers prior to turning in for the evening. I helped them up the stairs, and that was that. Both were out like a light in no time.

Ike told me he loved me.

Juli reminded me to feed Rajah. Three times.

She might have her suspicions in the morning, and I figured she‚Äôd be distraught to find *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* missing, but I‚Äôd cross that bridge when I came to it. 

As I drew Ike‚Äôs bedroom door closed, there *they* were.

Lying on their belly in the hallway, absentmindedly flicking water around their bowl with their seemingly nailless, human fingers.

That moment was the first pleasurable one I‚Äôd experienced since the whole damn ordeal began.

They were making it easy for me.

I tiptoed across the carpet, gaze ripe with beautiful violence, and when I was close enough, I knelt down and straddled the intruder. 

They writhed, attempting to get out from under me.

It was no use.

Only then did I experience a brief, smoldering curiosity about what was hidden beneath.

I clasped my hands at the point where its mask and neck became indistinguishable, and began wrenching it upwards. A deluge of endorphins set my blood on fire. My entire body radiated blissful warmth.

This fever dream was finally going to be over.

When the mask started to give, as threads of anchoring sinew started to snap, that‚Äôs when I heard their howls.

Both Juli and Ike, wailing in discordant unity.

Paternal instinct got me upright.

Before my conscious mind could even register the circumstances, I was kneeling beside my son.

He was sitting straight up, shoulders tensed to hell and back, eyes rolled into his skull, and, God, there was blood. Tiny crimson dewdrops formed a ring around his neck, *exactly* where I‚Äôd been tearing at the mask.

His screams grew fainter.

After a few seconds, he fell back limply onto his pillow, almost as if he‚Äôd passed out from within a dream. Only then did the wails completely die out.

Then, the house was utterly silent. Juli had stopped too.

Whatever I did *them,* it seemed to translate to my family. They were connected. Tethered.

I turned around, nearly toppling back onto Ike from the shock of what I saw.

*They* were there. In the doorway.

Standing on two feet.

Rajah‚Äôs stretched, vacant face stared daggers into me.

Gradually, it got back on all fours, pawed past me, climbed onto Ike‚Äôs bed, and curled up at his feet.

And I just stood there, paralyzed.

The message was obvious. They didn‚Äôt need a voice for me to understand.

*‚ÄúCheckmate.‚Äù*

The next morning, as I stewed over a mug of lukewarm coffee at the kitchen table, Juli approached me holding her pillowcase.

*‚ÄúHey! Glad to see you up so early.‚Äù*

I nodded, keeping my eyes fixed on the black liquid.

*‚ÄúWhat do you make of these stains? Smells a hell of a lot like blood, and it wasn‚Äôt there before I went to bed. I thought I saw some dried blood on my neck, but I looked myself up and down in the mirror and it doesn‚Äôt seem like I have a scratch on me. I don‚Äôt know; it‚Äôs just weird.‚Äù*

She dropped the pillowcase onto the table and returned to her morning routine. A blotchy, maroon-colored oval marred the light blue fabric, no bigger than a quarter. Flecks of coagulation dislodged as I scraped my thumbnail over the stain, but as I put it to my nose and sniffed, I didn‚Äôt detect even a hint of that sickly sweet, iron-kissed scent.

*‚ÄúHmm. Yup, smells like blood to me. Strange,‚Äù* I replied, draping the pillowcase over the top of a nearby chair.

*‚ÄúRight?‚Äù* She paced out into the foyer and began calling for Ike.

After years of snorting cocaine, my sense of smell was effectively nonexistent. Rarely, I‚Äôd get a faint whiff of something, but it‚Äôd have to be exceptionally fragrant to wake up my fried nerves, and it was always fleeting.

Juli didn‚Äôt know that, though. I was used to lying about it, too embarrassed to reveal the lengths to which I‚Äôd ravaged my body at the altar of *feeling good*.

My eyes darted to the pantry. 

There was a muffled tapping coming from the inside. The clack of my wife‚Äôs heels echoed as she moved to open the door.

The intruder spilled out, mask thudding against the floor, cans of beans and boxes of spaghetti toppling over like bowling pins.

*‚ÄúRajah, you goof, there you are,‚Äù* Juli cooed.

They got on all fours and began shaking violently, airing out their hypothetical fur, causing a cloud of pale dust to collect around them. Once settled, they tilted their mask up to *‚Äúlook‚Äù* at my wife.

She stared back at them, silent, grinning. After a moment, she turned to me and said:

*‚ÄúWow! He is vocal today, good Lord.‚Äù*

At no point did I hear *anything* from *them*.

Juli paced out of the kitchen, chuckling to herself.

I glared at the intruder. They had everyone else fooled, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to pinpoint what made me so damn special.

Suddenly, I had an idea.

What if something in my blood was allowing me to see through the illusion? 

Could I be genetically immune? 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, walked up to *them*, and snapped a quick picture.

Then, I texted my brother.

*‚ÄúFree for dinner tonight? Ike would love to see his uncle.‚Äù*

Dan and I weren‚Äôt estranged, but we weren‚Äôt on great terms, either. He lived about an hour away and had his own shit to deal with. More than that, though, I‚Äôd said some things better left unsaid while still in the throes of substance abuse. He‚Äôd kept me at arm‚Äôs length ever since.

I towered over the indecipherable devil, the haunting melody of my spellbound wife and son laughing upstairs thumping against my eardrums.

My hand buzzed.

*‚ÄúSure. Good to hear from you. Cars out of commission - mind picking me up?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHappy to.‚Äù* I replied.

Then, with no context, I forwarded him the picture I‚Äôd just taken, and waited.

The dots of a pending reply appeared across my phone screen. My heart racketed around my ribcage.

My life teetered on what he saw.

*‚ÄúEww. What the fuck is that, Marv?‚Äù*

Relief washed over me.

*‚ÄúTell you more later. Be there at 5.‚Äù*

I peered down at *them* and smiled wide, baring my teeth.

\- - - - - 

Most of the trip home from Dan‚Äôs was silent. I was too nervous to hold a conversation, manically tapping on the steering wheel, thoughts spinning.

As we were pulling off the interstate, he broke that silence, but not in the way I was expecting.

*‚ÄúHey, you haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶taken anything, right? Still on the wagon, so to speak?‚Äù* he asked.

Automatically, I responded:

*‚ÄúWhat? No. God, I wish.‚Äù* Each small word came out swift and punctuated.

Even with just my peripheral vision, I could tell he was giving me *that* look. A pitying condescension that always felt like a splash of acid gnawing at my skin. The type of look that used to reliably throw me into a rage at a moment‚Äôs notice.

I swallowed and rolled my shoulders. Focused my attention on the heat from the setting sun cascading through the windshield, rather than the resentment sizzling in my veins.

*‚ÄúThings at home have been better,‚Äù* I sighed.

Talk about an understatement, but what else could I say? Where would I even start?

I lost my job?

I was in a psychiatric hospital for months?

There‚Äôs a demon eunuch dressed as my house cat, and only I can tell? 

No.

He‚Äôd think I‚Äôd gone off the deep end.

Once he saw it for himself, then I‚Äôd be able to spill my guts. Once he understood, then we could strategize. 

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as bad as you - ‚Äú*

He paused, sniffing the air. A bout of harsh, vigorous coughing took hold of him. His eyes became glassy and red.

I considered pulling over by our town‚Äôs welcome sign, but he waved for me to keep going as I flicked my turn signal on.

*‚ÄúSorry - ‚Äú* he sputtered. *‚ÄúAllergies really have been a bitch this year.‚Äù*

The fit abruptly dissipated. When I looked over, he didn't seem concerned, and his breathing was steady, so I just kept going.  

A minute later, we pulled into my driveway.

He asked one last question as we walked up to the stoop, the final glimmers of orange twilight fading away above our heads.

*‚ÄúOh! Almost forgot - what the hell was that picture you sent me? Shit was cursed. Nearly fell out of my chair when it popped up,‚Äù* he chuckled.

I pretended not to hear him and opened the front door.

\- - - - - 

Hours passed before dinner was ready. 

We chatted, gave Dan copious updates about Ike, and even had time to play a few games of backgammon while the roast cooked. He continued to cough, but the fits were smaller, more contained. Honestly, he didn't even seem to notice them. 

All the while, *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* never showed their face. Dread crawled over my skin like termites through wood, but I kept my cool.

*They‚Äôd* come.

Around eight, the four of us sat down to eat. Lines of steam rose above the glistening pile of meat at the center of the table. Ike, wanting to come off as a proper gentleman, insisted on serving us, dropping asymmetric portions of beef, mashed potatoes, and baked asparagus across each of our plates.

*‚ÄúAlright! Dig in.‚Äù* Juli announced.

My son descended ravenously. Still on edge, I gingerly mixed the gravy into the potatoes, eyes darting between each of the three entrances to our kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed something peculiar about Juli.

She was holding her utensils upright - a fork in one hand, a knife in the other - but she wasn‚Äôt moving, eyes locked on me but glazed over.

*‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶everything OK?‚Äù*

The only part of her that budged was her lips.

*‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù* 

Stomach twisting into agonizing knots, I turned to Dan.

He was swiping at the meal, but every time, his fork missed. 

A little too high. A little too far left. 

Over and over and over again.

*‚ÄúJuli, this turkey is something else,‚Äù* he muttered.

Something was desperately wrong.

Abruptly, my wife released her grip, utensils clattering against the plate.

*‚ÄúWow, I am stuffed!‚Äù* she proclaimed.

Juli sprang from her chair.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers.‚Äù*

She balled her hand into a fist, brought it close to her face, and began knocking on her forehead.

The resulting sound had an unnaturally pervasive resonance, like hot water running through a loose copper pipe, metal expanding and colliding against a nearby wall. 

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

A series of wild thuds emanated from the foyer; a bevy of hands and feet and knees crashing down the stairs.

The frenzied stampede of a starving animal.

As the masked intruder charged into the room, Juli walked over to his dinner bowl and dumped the entire meal into it, pieces haphazardly ricocheting onto the side of a cabinet and the surrounding floor.

Suddenly, I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen her eat *anything* substantial since I left for that trip months prior. A few slices of toast with her coffee the morning, but nothing more.

Dan pivoted to face *them* as they entered.

I held my breath.

He swung to me.

His eyes were rolled back into his skull - white balls of tapioca adorned with a latticework of bright capillaries, tiny red worms wading through a thick ooze.

*‚ÄúI was wondering when the little guy would show up. I‚Äôve missed him!‚Äù*

My heart buckled. My mind fractured.

Identically, my brother sprung to his feet, grabbed his plate, and dumped it in front of *them*.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers! Pets have to be fed, and we don‚Äôt want Ike to be the one to feed them, right? No, of course not. We want the best for our prodigy. We want them to grow. We want to thrive. Right? Right?‚Äù*

The intruder hastily gathered the tribute into their arms, gravy smearing an impromptu Rorschach test along their trunk, and then began galloping past the table. At some point, Ike had gotten up and was standing by the screen door, creaking it open so they could careen into the backyard without losing an ounce of momentum.

For months, this had been the routine. 

Looking at Ike, I found myself at a crossroads.

I could just give up.

Allow my family to be eaten away from the inside out, until there was nothing left, until they‚Äôd been made hollow.

Hell, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard, and who knows?

Weak and empty, they might not even have the brain power to notice if indulged in a vice or two on the side. A family that would stick around no matter what I did to myself.

I wanted that at some point, right?

Or, I could give chase to that incomprehensible *thing*, that fucking parasite.

Even if it felt hopeless, completely and utterly insurmountable,

I could still try.

Blood thrumming, heart burning,

I shot up and followed *them* into the moonless night.

\- - - - - 

It‚Äôs currently 11 PM.

When I finally arrived home, Ike and Juli were sleeping soundly, and Dan was gone.

But I don‚Äôt know where he got to, since I drove him.

There are‚Ä¶holes in the forest. Burrows. Tunnels.

I watched the intruder dive into one, still holding the food.

When I put my ear to the hole, I heard something.

Mewing.

Multiple identical, high-pitched yowls, overlaid with each other. Sounded *exactly* like Rajah when we forgot to fill his bowl. Hungry begging, but in eerie triplicate.

I never considered what happened to the *real* him until that moment.

If that is truly our original house cat, deep in the hole.

That‚Äôs not all, though.

On the way back, I passed by Mr. Hooper. He lives two doors down from us.

He was walking what he *believed* was his husky.

The man looked like he‚Äôd dropped thirty pounds since I last saw him.

It‚Äôs not just happening to my family.

I think the whole town is infested.

\- - - - - 

Not sure what to do next.

Search for Dan? Return to the hole?

It‚Äôs unclear, but I‚Äôll figure it out.

I‚Äôm publishing this in case something happens to me.

Juli, if you‚Äôre reading this, 

I‚Äôm not crazy.

I love you.

*‚ÄúHey! Get the* ***fuck*** *off my son!‚Äù* I barked, storming towards our couch, suitcase falling from my grasp somewhere along the way.

Juli planted a firm hand on my chest as I tried to pass her and asked what *my* problem was. 

She insisted that I must be exhausted from the flight, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight, but I could feel the subtext. 

The insinuation was as plain as day. 

She thought I was ass-over-tits drunk - or worse - right in front of our son, something I‚Äôd promised never to be guilty of again.

Heat gathered under my shirt collar. A flush crept up my face.

I was sober.

Stone-cold sober.

Dry as a goddamn ditch.

I mean, *she* was the one who‚Äôd allowed that *freak* into our home. *She* was the one who was letting them lounge on our kid‚Äôs lap like nothing was wrong.

How did I know *she* wasn‚Äôt on something?

Wordlessly, I ripped Juli‚Äôs hand away and rushed past her.

*‚ÄúDad?! Dad, what‚Äôs the matter? It‚Äôs just Rajah, Dad!‚Äù*

Tears began flooding. It hurt to make Ike upset, yes, but that hurt was nothing compared to the fear I felt, the raw, blistering confusion of it all. It was the gentle sparks of a firecracker versus the roiling fireball of a ballistic missile. 

No contest.

I loomed over the brown leather sectional. Ike slid out from under *them* and scampered over the top of the couch, sprinting into his mother‚Äôs trembling arms as soon as his feet hit the floor.

The person dressed to look like our house cat didn‚Äôt even react.

Knees to their chest, curled and comfortable, they placed a painted, five-fingered hand up to their mouth and rubbed their palm against their mask. I suppose they were simulating self-cleaning, but the mask didn‚Äôt have a hole for a tongue to come out of, so their skin just squeaked against the material.

My eyelids twitched. Icy sweat drenched my back. I looked to my wife for answers, but she just seemed terrified.

Terrified of *me*.

*‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶what is this...?‚Äù* I whispered, knuckles collapsing into a fist.

Ike whimpered. My wife raked his beach blonde hair, silent, wide-eyed.

***‚ÄúWho is this Juli?‚Äù*** The dry, crackling scream sent her dashing to the kitchen table, where her phone was resting.

Ike transitioned into full-on hysteria.

And, very much like a cat, the intruder appeared perfectly indifferent to our mounting duress. 

They stopped faux-licking their palm and stretched wide, shifting their stomach towards me, unafraid, unbothered, unprotected.

I stared at them, disbelief running dizzy laps around the base of my skull.

They were around five feet tall, mask included, which was circular, stout, flattened at the top, triple the size of a human skull, and circumferentially smooth. The shape reminded me of the box I used to store drum cymbals. 

Our calico‚Äôs likeness had been painted across the mask. Her light green eyes. The black splotch surrounding her nose. The ragged edges of her left ear. To fit the mask‚Äôs bizarre dimensions, however, all those familiar features were slightly distorted.

Everything was a little *too* wide and a little *too* big. 

It was the same with their gaunt, emaciated body. 

They‚Äôd faithfully and meticulously translated the markings of her fur onto their skin, stretching the pattern to fit over their lanky proportions. 

A patch of white over their sunken, craterous abdomen. 

Speckles of soft orange along their forearms, extremities which had cords of tendon revoltingly visible because of the way their thin skin wrapped tightly around their fatless frame.

Worst of all, they were naked.

No genitals, though. The crease was sleek and seamless, like a Ken doll.

My rage boiled over.

I descended, ready to cave their chest in with my bare hands.

*‚Äú****Marvin - Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs just a cat. Get a hold of yourself!‚Äù*** Juli blared.

My fist halted inches from their breastbone. 

They didn‚Äôt flinch.

I creaked upright so I could see my wife‚Äôs eyes.

*‚ÄúYou think this‚Ä¶you think they‚Äôre a cat? You think* ***this*** *is Rajah?‚Äù*

Ike was beyond hysterics at that point, shrieking, inconsolable, face pressed hard into her pant leg.

Juli didn‚Äôt answer. 

She pulled Ike away, into another room, urgently muttering to the 9-1-1 dispatcher.

*‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶he‚Äôs on something, or drunk, or sick - I don‚Äôt know. Just get someone over here.‚Äù*

My mouth felt dry. I ran a quivering hand through my sweat-caked hair, slicking it back. Wanted to look somewhat presentable when the police arrived.

All the while, *they* loafed on the couch.

Sleeping? Smiling? Laughing? Watching? Waiting?

I couldn‚Äôt tell.

The mask had no holes, and they never spoke.

I stood in front of the couch, lightly swaying, an empty swing shivering in a cold wind, observing patches of painted skin sinking between their brittle ribs as they exhaled.

How can they breathe? - I wondered, given that the plastic edges of the mask seemed to be continuous with their neck. I was no closer to an answer to that question when the police arrived a few minutes later.

I implored them to arrest the intruder, begging them to see reason, praying their view matched my own.

They looked at the *thing* on my couch and snickered, eyes gleaming with amusement.

I shouldn‚Äôt have expected them to take the request seriously.

How could I?

It was just a cat, after all.

\- - - - - 

The police graciously escorted me to the emergency room.

Not in cuffs, thankfully. Not that time.

All the tests were unremarkable.

The clear fluid they drew from my spine didn‚Äôt show signs of an infection agitating my nervous system.

The urine drug screen came back positive, but only for opioids, and the doctor expected that, given I was on naltrexone. The med helped dull any residual cravings for my old vices - alcohol and cocaine - but shared a chemical similarity to oxycodone.

My kidneys, my heart, my liver: every organ seemed to be in working order.

Far as the doctor could tell, there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with me, and I hadn‚Äôt ingested anything they believed could inspire psychosis.

But when the psychiatrist asked, I remained insistent.

That *thing* wasn‚Äôt a cat.

From there, my trajectory was set.

Next stop: *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*

The first time wasn‚Äôt too bad. My fellow captives were tolerable, and the docs were nice enough. Smart, too. They eventually had me believing I was suffering under an *‚Äúisolated delusion precipitated by extreme stress‚Äù*. Their words, not mine.

Initially, I rejected the theory. 

The more I considered it, though, the more it seemed to click into place.

Undeniably, work had been taxing, and no one else saw Rajah as I did. Occam‚Äôs Razor suggested something was wrong with *me,* rather than everyone else. Not Ike, not Juli, and not the police.

Just me.

\- - - - - 

Five days later, I was discharged.

Ike was ecstatic, jumping up and down in the back seat of our sedan, wrapping a pair of little hands around my shoulders as I clicked the passenger seat safety belt into the holster. Juli was more reticent about my release, but she did a good job faking happiness for Ike‚Äôs sake.

I was the last to enter when we got home.

My feet felt thickly calcified to our stone stoop. It took Juli holding my hand to get me inside, practically yanking me over the threshold.

The door swung shut behind me. 

Electricity sizzled up the curves of my neck as I scanned my surroundings. Juli ran her thumb delicately across my palm. The massage was tender and affectionate, but I sensed a similar electricity hissing along her skin. She was nervous too, and in retrospect, she had every right to be.

I saw no masked intruder.

My static calmed. I turned to Juli and shot her a flimsy smile.

Then, there was a noise above us.

A quiet, inscrutable message.

A painful reminder.

*Knock.* 

*Knock.* 

*Knock.*

My body became a live-wire. Juli‚Äôs thumb dug vicious stigmata into my palm, having sensed my panic.

I glanced up, and there *they* were.

Lying prone on the balcony that overlooked our foyer, all but their mask wreathed in deep shadow, knocking the poor, oversized facsimile of Rajah‚Äôs skull against the bannister‚Äôs small wooden pillars, alternating left to right, right to left, left to right.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

The lead psychiatrist at *‚ÄúFalling Leaves‚Äù* informed me I went absolutely ballistic at the mere sight of our innocent house cat, and that my stay the second time around would be longer.

Much longer.

I don‚Äôt recall going ballistic, though. 

I have no memory of what transpired between seeing *them* again and the point at which I arrived at the psychiatric hospital.

All I remember is their terrible, pendulous sway, extending on into infinity. A video on a frozen computer screen, constantly refreshing but never righting itself, never moving on, perpetually misaligned and distorted.

A part of me never left that moment.

A part of me is still there, watching, helpless.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

\- - - - - 

Juli still visited me over the following three months, but only weekly, and she wasn‚Äôt bringing Ike with her. Not only that, but judging by the way her cheekbones had begun progressively sharpening, she wasn‚Äôt eating. The stress of it all was getting to her, and that fact killed me.

At first, I pleaded.

Said things like:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not insane!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI know what I saw!‚Äù*

and

*‚ÄúFor the love of God, Juli, you and Ike aren‚Äôt safe!‚Äù*.

All she did in response was avert her gaze.

My pleas were falling on deaf ears, and the only thing those outbursts were earning me was a longer sentence at *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*.

It was a tough pill to swallow, but I realized that feigning recovery from my *‚Äúdelusion‚Äù* was the most logical step forward. 

So, that‚Äôs what I did. 

Slowly but surely, I ‚Äú*recovered‚Äù*. Even endorsed during a group therapy session that I‚Äôd been covertly indulging in some designer, PCP-like drugs. Drugs that wouldn‚Äôt come up on a routine test, but certainly could send a mind through the proverbial garbage disposal. 

The psychiatrist seemed to buy it - hook, line and sinker.

One-hundred and eight grueling days later, my wife brought me home.

Her lips twitched as she drove. Her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. She‚Äôd lost a significant amount of weight - twenty pounds, maybe more.

*They* were right inside the door when I opened it.

Preening on their back beside our welcome mat, body contorted into a lazy stretch, silently beseeching a stomach scratch.

I watched her anxiety flourish into outright panic, knees fluttering, breathing sharp and shallow. Her eyes flashed to me, then to what she saw as our defenseless cat, and back again, petrified about what I might do.

Before she could pull her phone from her bag, I was bending down, rubbing my fingers against *their* belly. Its skin was doughy but disturbingly coarse, like partially congealed flour with grains of asphalt mixed into the batter.

As I suppressed a gag, I felt the silky touch of Juli‚Äôs hand on my shoulder.

*‚ÄúSo good to have you back, Marvin,‚Äù* she whispered.

I nodded, still rubbing; the dead eyes of their painted mask pointed at me.

Juli walked away. As soon as she was out of earshot, I stood up and retracted my hand, which was now coated in a fine, gray, odorless dust. 

Something was different about *them*.

Their abdomen seemed fuller than before.

\- - - - - 

The solution to this mess, as I imagined it, appeared relatively straightforward.

I didn‚Äôt need to understand *them*.

I didn‚Äôt need to know what they were, why only I could appreciate their true form, and what their purpose in my home was.

I just needed to kill *them*.

Thus, I needed my family incapacitated, unable to intervene.

So I dosed them.

One milligram of Lorazepam for Ike, four milligrams of Lorazepam for Juli.

For the record, benzodiazepines were never my vice. I mean, who wants to sleep through their high? Never made much sense to me. Still, I had use for them outside of hedonism as a sort of biochemical kill-switch.

Having the shakes from alcohol withdrawal? Take a Lorazepam.

Coke got you a little too revved up? Take a Lorazepam.

Thankfully, I was able to locate a dusty pill bottle stashed under a floorboard in the attic: a relic from my days as a fiend.

It wasn‚Äôt as dramatic as something like chloroform. They both just became incredibly drowsy after downing some spiked lemonade, neither very interested in having leftovers prior to turning in for the evening. I helped them up the stairs, and that was that. Both were out like a light in no time.

Ike told me he loved me.

Juli reminded me to feed Rajah. Three times.

She might have her suspicions in the morning, and I figured she‚Äôd be distraught to find *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* missing, but I‚Äôd cross that bridge when I came to it. 

As I drew Ike‚Äôs bedroom door closed, there *they* were.

Lying on their belly in the hallway, absentmindedly flicking water around their bowl with their seemingly nailless, human fingers.

That moment was the first pleasurable one I‚Äôd experienced since the whole damn ordeal began.

They were making it easy for me.

I tiptoed across the carpet, gaze ripe with beautiful violence, and when I was close enough, I knelt down and straddled the intruder. 

They writhed, attempting to get out from under me.

It was no use.

Only then did I experience a brief, smoldering curiosity about what was hidden beneath.

I clasped my hands at the point where its mask and neck became indistinguishable, and began wrenching it upwards. A deluge of endorphins set my blood on fire. My entire body radiated blissful warmth.

This fever dream was finally going to be over.

When the mask started to give, as threads of anchoring sinew started to snap, that‚Äôs when I heard their howls.

Both Juli and Ike, wailing in discordant unity.

Paternal instinct got me upright.

Before my conscious mind could even register the circumstances, I was kneeling beside my son.

He was sitting straight up, shoulders tensed to hell and back, eyes rolled into his skull, and, God, there was blood. Tiny crimson dewdrops formed a ring around his neck, *exactly* where I‚Äôd been tearing at the mask.

His screams grew fainter.

After a few seconds, he fell back limply onto his pillow, almost as if he‚Äôd passed out from within a dream. Only then did the wails completely die out.

Then, the house was utterly silent. Juli had stopped too.

Whatever I did *them,* it seemed to translate to my family. They were connected. Tethered.

I turned around, nearly toppling back onto Ike from the shock of what I saw.

*They* were there. In the doorway.

Standing on two feet.

Rajah‚Äôs stretched, vacant face stared daggers into me.

Gradually, it got back on all fours, pawed past me, climbed onto Ike‚Äôs bed, and curled up at his feet.

And I just stood there, paralyzed.

The message was obvious. They didn‚Äôt need a voice for me to understand.

*‚ÄúCheckmate.‚Äù*

\- - - - - 

The next morning, as I stewed over a mug of lukewarm coffee at the kitchen table, Juli approached me holding her pillowcase.

*‚ÄúHey! Glad to see you up so early.‚Äù*

I nodded, keeping my eyes fixed on the black liquid.

*‚ÄúWhat do you make of these stains? Smells a hell of a lot like blood, and it wasn‚Äôt there before I went to bed. I thought I saw some dried blood on my neck, but I looked myself up and down in the mirror and it doesn‚Äôt seem like I have a scratch on me. I don‚Äôt know; it‚Äôs just weird.‚Äù*

She dropped the pillowcase onto the table and returned to her morning routine. A blotchy, maroon-colored oval marred the light blue fabric, no bigger than a quarter. Flecks of coagulation dislodged as I scraped my thumbnail over the stain, but as I put it to my nose and sniffed, I didn‚Äôt detect even a hint of that sickly sweet, iron-kissed scent.

*‚ÄúHmm. Yup, smells like blood to me. Strange,‚Äù* I replied, draping the pillowcase over the top of a nearby chair.

*‚ÄúRight?‚Äù* She paced out into the foyer and began calling for Ike.

After years of snorting cocaine, my sense of smell was effectively nonexistent. Rarely, I‚Äôd get a faint whiff of something, but it‚Äôd have to be exceptionally fragrant to wake up my fried nerves, and it was always fleeting.

Juli didn‚Äôt know that, though. I was used to lying about it, too embarrassed to reveal the lengths to which I‚Äôd ravaged my body at the altar of *feeling good*.

My eyes darted to the pantry. 

There was a muffled tapping coming from the inside. The clack of my wife‚Äôs heels echoed as she moved to open the door.

The intruder spilled out, mask thudding against the floor, cans of beans and boxes of spaghetti toppling over like bowling pins.

*‚ÄúRajah, you goof, there you are,‚Äù* Juli cooed.

They got on all fours and began shaking violently, airing out their hypothetical fur, causing a cloud of pale dust to collect around them. Once settled, they tilted their mask up to *‚Äúlook‚Äù* at my wife.

She stared back at them, silent, grinning. After a moment, she turned to me and said:

*‚ÄúWow! He is vocal today, good Lord.‚Äù*

At no point did I hear *anything* from *them*.

Juli paced out of the kitchen, chuckling to herself.

I glared at the intruder. They had everyone else fooled, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to pinpoint what made me so damn special.

Suddenly, I had an idea.

What if something in my blood was allowing me to see through the illusion? 

Could I be genetically immune? 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, walked up to *them*, and snapped a quick picture.

Then, I texted my brother.

*‚ÄúFree for dinner tonight? Ike would love to see his uncle.‚Äù*

Dan and I weren‚Äôt estranged, but we weren‚Äôt on great terms, either. He lived about an hour away and had his own shit to deal with. More than that, though, I‚Äôd said some things better left unsaid while still in the throes of substance abuse. He‚Äôd kept me at arm‚Äôs length ever since.

I towered over the indecipherable devil, the haunting melody of my spellbound wife and son laughing upstairs thumping against my eardrums.

My hand buzzed.

*‚ÄúSure. Good to hear from you. Cars out of commission - mind picking me up?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHappy to.‚Äù* I replied.

Then, with no context, I forwarded him the picture I‚Äôd just taken, and waited.

The dots of a pending reply appeared across my phone screen. My heart racketed around my ribcage.

My life teetered on what he saw.

*‚ÄúEww. What the fuck is that, Marv?‚Äù*

Relief washed over me.

*‚ÄúTell you more later. Be there at 5.‚Äù*

I peered down at *them* and smiled wide, baring my teeth.

\- - - - - 

Most of the trip home from Dan‚Äôs was silent. I was too nervous to hold a conversation, manically tapping on the steering wheel, thoughts spinning.

As we were pulling off the interstate, he broke that silence, but not in the way I was expecting.

*‚ÄúHey, you haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶taken anything, right? Still on the wagon, so to speak?‚Äù* he asked.

Automatically, I responded:

*‚ÄúWhat? No. God, I wish.‚Äù* Each small word came out swift and punctuated.

Even with just my peripheral vision, I could tell he was giving me *that* look. A pitying condescension that always felt like a splash of acid gnawing at my skin. The type of look that used to reliably throw me into a rage at a moment‚Äôs notice.

I swallowed and rolled my shoulders. Focused my attention on the heat from the setting sun cascading through the windshield, rather than the resentment sizzling in my veins.

*‚ÄúThings at home have been better,‚Äù* I sighed.

Talk about an understatement, but what else could I say? Where would I even start?

I lost my job?

I was in a psychiatric hospital for months?

There‚Äôs a demon eunuch dressed as my house cat, and only I can tell? 

No.

He‚Äôd think I‚Äôd gone off the deep end.

Once he saw it for himself, then I‚Äôd be able to spill my guts. Once he understood, then we could strategize. 

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as bad as you - ‚Äú*

He paused, sniffing the air. A bout of harsh, vigorous coughing took hold of him. His eyes became glassy and red.

I considered pulling over by our town‚Äôs welcome sign, but he waved for me to keep going as I flicked my turn signal on.

*‚ÄúSorry - ‚Äú* he sputtered. *‚ÄúAllergies really have been a bitch this year.‚Äù*

The fit abruptly dissipated. When I looked over, he didn't seem concerned, and his breathing was steady, so I just kept going.  

A minute later, we pulled into my driveway.

He asked one last question as we walked up to the stoop, the final glimmers of orange twilight fading away above our heads.

*‚ÄúOh! Almost forgot - what the hell was that picture you sent me? Shit was cursed. Nearly fell out of my chair when it popped up,‚Äù* he chuckled.

I pretended not to hear him and opened the front door.

\- - - - - 

Hours passed before dinner was ready. 

We chatted, gave Dan copious updates about Ike, and even had time to play a few games of backgammon while the roast cooked. He continued to cough, but the fits were smaller, more contained. Honestly, he didn't even seem to notice them. 

All the while, *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* never showed their face. Dread crawled over my skin like termites through wood, but I kept my cool.

*They‚Äôd* come.

Around eight, the four of us sat down to eat. Lines of steam rose above the glistening pile of meat at the center of the table. Ike, wanting to come off as a proper gentleman, insisted on serving us, dropping asymmetric portions of beef, mashed potatoes, and baked asparagus across each of our plates.

*‚ÄúAlright! Dig in.‚Äù* Juli announced.

My son descended ravenously. Still on edge, I gingerly mixed the gravy into the potatoes, eyes darting between each of the three entrances to our kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed something peculiar about Juli.

She was holding her utensils upright - a fork in one hand, a knife in the other - but she wasn‚Äôt moving, eyes locked on me but glazed over.

*‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶everything OK?‚Äù*

The only part of her that budged was her lips.

*‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù* 

Stomach twisting into agonizing knots, I turned to Dan.

He was swiping at the meal, but every time, his fork missed. 

A little too high. A little too far left. 

Over and over and over again.

*‚ÄúJuli, this turkey is something else,‚Äù* he muttered.

Something was desperately wrong.

Abruptly, my wife released her grip, utensils clattering against the plate.

*‚ÄúWow, I am stuffed!‚Äù* she proclaimed.

Juli sprang from her chair.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers.‚Äù*

She balled her hand into a fist, brought it close to her face, and began knocking on her forehead.

The resulting sound had an unnaturally pervasive resonance, like hot water running through a loose copper pipe, metal expanding and colliding against a nearby wall. 

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

A series of wild thuds emanated from the foyer; a bevy of hands and feet and knees crashing down the stairs.

The frenzied stampede of a starving animal.

As the masked intruder charged into the room, Juli walked over to his dinner bowl and dumped the entire meal into it, pieces haphazardly ricocheting onto the side of a cabinet and the surrounding floor.

Suddenly, I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen her eat *anything* substantial since I left for that trip months prior. A few slices of toast with her coffee the morning, but nothing more.

Dan pivoted to face *them* as they entered.

I held my breath.

He swung to me.

His eyes were rolled back into his skull - white balls of tapioca adorned with a latticework of bright capillaries, tiny red worms wading through a thick ooze.

*‚ÄúI was wondering when the little guy would show up. I‚Äôve missed him!‚Äù*

My heart buckled. My mind fractured.

Identically, my brother sprung to his feet, grabbed his plate, and dumped it in front of *them*.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers! Pets have to be fed, and we don‚Äôt want Ike to be the one to feed them, right? No, of course not. We want the best for our prodigy. We want them to grow. We want to thrive. Right? Right?‚Äù*

The intruder hastily gathered the tribute into their arms, gravy smearing an impromptu Rorschach test along their trunk, and then began galloping past the table. At some point, Ike had gotten up and was standing by the screen door, creaking it open so they could careen into the backyard without losing an ounce of momentum.

For months, this must have been the routine. 

Looking at Ike, I found myself at a crossroads.

I could just give up.

Allow my family to be eaten away from the inside out, until there was nothing left, until they‚Äôd been made hollow.

Hell, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard, and who knows?

Weak and empty, they might not even have the brain power to notice if indulged in a vice or two on the side. A family that would stick around no matter what I did to myself.

I wanted that at some point, right?

Or, I could give chase to that incomprehensible *thing*, that fucking parasite.

Even if it felt hopeless, completely and utterly insurmountable,

I could still try.

Blood thrumming, heart burning,

I shot up and followed *them* into the moonless night.

\- - - - - 

It‚Äôs currently 11 PM.

When I finally arrived home, Ike and Juli were sleeping soundly, and Dan was gone.

But I don‚Äôt know where he got to, since I drove him.

There are‚Ä¶holes in the forest. Burrows. Tunnels.

I watched the intruder dive into one, still holding the food.

When I put my ear to the hole, I heard something.

Mewing.

Multiple identical, high-pitched yowls, overlaid with each other. Sounded *exactly* like Rajah when we forgot to fill his bowl. Hungry begging, but in eerie triplicate.

I never considered what happened to the *real* him until that moment.

If that is truly our original house cat, deep in the hole.

That‚Äôs not all, though.

On the way back, I passed by Mr. Hooper. He lives two doors down from us.

He was walking what he *believed* was his husky.

The man looked like he‚Äôd dropped thirty pounds since I last saw him.

It‚Äôs not just happening to my family.

I think the whole town is infested.

\- - - - - 

Not sure what to do next.

Search for Dan? Return to the hole?

It‚Äôs unclear, but I‚Äôll figure it out.

I‚Äôm publishing this in case something happens to me.

Juli, if you‚Äôre reading this, 

I‚Äôm not crazy.

I love you.

But here, it's baaad.

I'm talking expired goods, unsanitary equipment and most recently,  the bees.

This place is almost always infested with numerous types of flies.  Gnats, mosquitos,  fruit flies you name it.  All of that bothers me but none more than the bees.

I get that a lot of jobs deal with bees: truck drivers, farmers, etc., but at LEAST most of those pay more than $8/hr. I feel like I'm going insane with the amount of BS I have to witness. 

So the format of this sub is past tense, but would I be overreacting to lose my shit at the first sting I get? Or in general?

# Some nifty ways to save money on things and get things you need or want for free.

**I've been doing this for the last 2 and a half years. Here is a detailed list of how you can obtain things you need or want for free or at very low cost**.

1. When I first moved into my new home, we didn't have that much furniture. I had downsized after I left my apartment and moved into a family member's home, but I was living in a small room in the basement. I began attending college online, and the desk I had was just too small for me to spread out and do my homework. It felt too cramped with my desktop computer taking up most of the space. I then began searching on the local next-door app for anyone giving a desk away. I eventually found someone giving away for free a big, beautiful desk that was perfect for what I needed. Brand new, it would probably cost anywhere from $300 to $400. It was in great condition, and I took it home. Luckily for me, I have a daughter who had a van and we loaded it up. Of course, to do this, you need to be able to pick furniture up. Or find someone who can pick it up for you. This desk was the first thing I got when I started my free-cycling.
2. I waited on the next-door app for a coffee table and end tables, and the same lady who gave me the desk was also giving these items away. We went to pick them up.
3. I needed some type of cabinetry for the dining room since it was pretty bare on one wall. I saw on the next-door app someone was giving away a 1940s antique German china cabinet worth between $1500 $2.5k for free. It is so beautiful, and I really appreciate furniture made with real wood that it will last for the rest of my life. It matches my dark wood dining room table very well. On the next-door app, people give away all sorts of things for free. It is worth keeping an eye on it.
4. Someone was giving away about 20 liquor bottles for free on the next-door app, and I managed to get those as well. I use these types of glass bottles to store glass beads in for my craft room. I love to repurpose things rather than throwing them away. I have even found some liquor bottles thrown on the ground during my walks. I pick them up and take them home, and wash them. Some are very small and pretty, and unique, and I love them to hold my glass beads.
5. I repurpose some candle glass jars as well for things like glass beads and my buttons I use for my crafts. Some are fairly large, and I set them on my coffee table full of glass beads. They are very pretty and decorative.
6. I attended the local library craft meeting the first couple of times, and one of the ladies there gave me a big brown paper bag full of craft supplies for knitting. She gave me some yarn, knitting looms, and even some knitting books. The library also gave us books to look through and to take for free. I was able to take home some quilting books that the library no longer wanted. One day, I went to the library and saw a table set up with a sign, Free Puzzles to Take and I grabbed the last one for my youngest grandson because he loves to do puzzles. Libraries often give stuff away for free.
7. One of the ladies at the library told me about The Crafter's Cafe in Flint and how the craft closet is where people can take free craft supplies, from fabrics, thread, cross stitch fabrics and thread to yarn and knitting needles, to even some crochet hooks. I have acquired a lot of free craft supplies this way, and I have also cleaned out my own craft room and donated about half of my craft supplies that I no longer wanted. I know this is local to me; however, if any of you readers are in my area, you also can take advantage of this place.
8. About a month ago, I needed some $, so I pulled some yarn out of my stash that I no longer had plans for, and I sold it on the next-door app. I was able to make an easy $20 selling 2 different sets of yarn for $10 each. I always try to keep my prices as low as possible because I understand most people are struggling in this economy. Using the next-door app to sell items locally is pretty easy to do, and you just might get lucky to make some money quickly.
9. Once we needed some dog food, and money was a bit tight for us, we researched online and found¬†kinship .com. If you sign up your cat or dog under 12 months old, you can get a kitten or puppy pack for free. It includes 3 wet food samples and great coupons, and even a coupon for a free bag of dry pet food. It has been a great help to us.
10. I signed up my pet dog on the Purina app, and I have also been able to acquire some free pet food samples this way. I have even been able to get free cat food samples, although we don't have a cat right now, I have donated them.
11. Facebook always has a post offering a free sample. Sign up for them and get those free samples. I have received free pet food samples or even free women's face lotion samples, perfume samples, and even free books.
12. We have a Tardis locally where we can donate food or take donated food items. I have donated the free cat food samples there for others to take, and I have acquired cans of free fruit and bags of rice this way when we needed them. Sometimes other things are put in there, like clothing. I have also taken a ceramic bowl that has a hole in it to use as a yarn bowl for my coffee table. Not all places will have a Tardis, though, but if you want to know if your local area has one, try searching on a Facebook group.
13. If I needed some cash, I used websites such as¬†fivesurveys .com, and my other favorite one is¬†heycash .com. These 2 websites have been pretty great, and the payouts are on the same day in less than 5 minutes, and you can earn a few quick, easy bucks. One day, I managed to earn $11 on the¬†heycash .com¬†website in about 3 hours. It has been a lifesaver for me.
14. I also use the¬†pinchme .com¬†website to get free samples. I have received everything from eco laundry detergents to lip balm to even full-sized antiperspirant/deodorants and a free makeup bag, which I use to put my small craft tools inside for my main craft bag. I have about 7 PinchMe boxes on the way. I have also been given a free $15 Amazon gift card, which I used for free self-care items. If you earn 5000 coins, you can receive a free $50 Amazon gift card. I am about halfway there. They also always send me free magazines. I do not opt in for this. It is automatic. But they are free.
15. I have also signed up for¬†honeygain .com, which is a passive income streaming website. I have had a couple of payouts so far. It is a very slow earning process, but at least the money will come at some point in time that you can use toward something.
16. I have also signed up at¬†tryspree .com¬†and have received free items such as a calendar for the new year and bookmarks and drink mix samples, women's face lotion samples, and even a protein bar. This website often has sweepstakes to sign up for as well. Good luck! Yesterday I acquired a $29.99 PC game for free.
17. I am a crafter, so I always search for ways to obtain some craft items I can use later. I signed up for every single furniture website for free fabric swatches that I could find. I received most of them and have a pretty large box full of free fabric swatches.
18. I recently signed up for a few free wallpaper samples. I need them because I have a dollhouse to work on.
19. I signed up for free deck wood samples. I can use them for macrame projects to add a shelf. I am a crafter, therefore I can use pretty much anything.
20. I've had a few payouts on¬†inboxdollars .com however, they pay very little, so earning the minimum payout takes a long time.
21. People in my family always give me clothes they can't wear anymore. I rarely need to buy clothes. The last clothing item I bought was a $4 light jacket when Family Dollar had their end-of-summer sale. I paid for it with bottles/cans.
22. Speedway gas station is always offering points and free items. I racked up enough points for a free $25 Speedway gift card last year. I am always getting free drinks, too.
23. I sometimes search online for other free sample websites. I recently signed up for the bzzagent.  com¬†website. I have yet to find out if they are any good.
24. I have tried the Buy Nothing Facebook Groups, but I didn't have much of a good experience with it; however, other people seem to, so go for it!
25. During my walks, I sometimes find bottles/cans thrown on the ground. I get the deposit for them. It is free $ for me to use.
26. I also found great deals for a few things we needed at our local garage/lawn sales. I spent $7 this past summer, and I know they were not free, but it was still a pretty good deal.
27. Sometimes my neighbors throw away useful things. I grabbed a large patio table from a neighbor and a couple of chairs. I have even grabbed a large Christmas tree someone was throwing away. We didn't have one and needed one anyway. Saving us about $150 or more. I saved it from landing in the landfill.
28. If I go to any local craft meet-ups, they usually have a table set up with free craft stuff to take. One person's trash is another person's treasure.
29. I signed up for my local funeral home to get some info on preplanning my burial arrangements, and they have invited me to dinners or breakfasts to listen to their speeches. They have also invited me on a day trip to a local casino. Everything was free. Even free game play or bingo play, and a free meal. The casino provided free coffee and soda. I had a great time. It didn't cost me anything. I know each funeral home does things differently, but try your local funeral home; you might be pleasantly surprised if they offer these as well.
30. I search for free knitting, crochet, cross-stitch, and sewing patterns online. There is a lot out there. Of course, not everyone will partake in these hobbies, but for those of you who do, keep searching! You just might find something worth creating.
31. I have received quite a few class-action lawsuit payouts. My last one, a couple of months ago, was for $250. A check for that amount just showed up for me. There are class-action lawsuit websites online. Sign up for all of them that you think you would qualify for. It is free $.
32. I have made some eBay purchases, got a notification for a rebate, signed up for the rebate, and purchased my items. Then, a few weeks later received my rebate. My items then cost me only .49. Not completely free, but still a pretty good deal. Used my rebate for other things I needed. Which just increases my abundance.
33. I donated plasma over a year ago and was able to get things I needed or had to pay for. This resource is still available to me when and if I need it again. My first month of donating plasma, I earned $800. Check Facebook for promo codes.

So these are some of the resources I use to get what I need for free or for very low cost.",6,1759715042.0,poor,0,0.87,False

I will start off with a apologies, this one will be long. I appreciate any advise you can give

Let me give some history

Before we started this relationship my GF and I dated about 6 years ago. This lasted a little more than one year. We found each other through social media then realized we lived relatively close to each other. We started meeting at night. She would sneak out of her house, then i would pick her up and we would have fun.We got caught one day. I want to clarify we were both over 18 but she lived in a very strict house hold. Due to her culture and her parents style of raising her. There were a lot of rules and she didnt get to leave home a lot. I was at the time living with very bad people and had some very bad habits. The situation of getting caught wasnt pretty. Her family was very upset and i almost got in a fight with her father. Her and I wanted to keep the relationship going. I had to change a lot. Got a new job. Moved to a new place with way better influences. Unlearned my bad habits. Then got to met her family. They started to let me come over. Then slowly brought me into the family. Our relationship grew. We spent a lot of time together. Towards the end expressed my desire to go to school and change career fields. I told her if i do this i coudnt spend as much time with her than i do now. She was all for it. Very supportive. I started school and our time together turned into to only weekends. She grew stagnant in her life. She stopped going out, stopped exploring schools and careers. I began having to do everything for her. Helping her plan her days, look into schools, or even planning to hangout with her friends. She had a very hard time figuring anything out on her own. Then i became your emotional release, every time she got mad, it became targeted at me. When she got sad she wanted me to solve her problems. Anxieties started up and all directed at me. I took it all and kept going. Then i started noticing when he had time together she she was on her most of the time smiling. She told me she made new friends on social media. I wasnt worried at first. She was pretty introverted and i was happy she was doing something. She started to pull away from me and hide her phone from me. I know it wasnt the best but i snopped. She was texting other guys. All these guys were showering her in complements. All of her respones were border line flirting. That was the final straw. I eneded the relationship. I will admit I ended it wrong. I didn't tell her why. I just ended it.

¬†Jumping to this year

 I was visiting family back home. This is a rare thing for me due to my job and its location. I received a message from my ex at the time asking if we could meet up. I haven't spoken to hear since the break up but i agreed. We agree to grab some coffee and caught up. This lead to us meeting up and talking a few more times. She is going to school. Working on her B.A. and looking into a M.A. Got her certification and started in the field she liked. She recently got out of a very toxic relationships and before that lets say really explored her sexual desires. She was very open about it and im not one to judge. I like my woman with experience now. Everything else was basically the same. Lived at home, same friends, same car and same everything else. As for me, once her and i broke up. I dropped out of school. I became stagnant. Partying, drinking and smoking the green became all i thought about. Then one day a golden opportunity came and my old manager sat me and gave me an awaking moment. There was a job opportunity, the job required me to move very far away from home. I took the job. This job made gave me the opportunity to grow and mature. Gave me lots of time alone to explore myself and lots of self reflection. There were some rough patches. I had to beat my addictions and bad habits. Then medical issue of being over weight. At the point visiting family I was doing really good with these. I know where i wanted to be and how im getting there. Towards the end of the trip we had conversations about starting a relationship. She was convinced this was ment to be. She expressed how she never found a relationship like the one her and i had before. That us meeting again. Both of us having feeling was a sign of us being together. I was very hesitant. I hadn't been in a relationship in a very long time. Plus we would have to be long distance. I told her my priorities in life and how im very focused on building myself, relationships with my family and my career. She would be a priority but not as high as those 3. She agreed to it. Said that she really wanted to be in a relationship with me again. I explained to her that I wanted to wait. She agreed to it said she would wait. We became friends and started texting and calling a lot. Due to my job I am alone most the time. Filling the loneliness with someone felt really good. We talked for about 2 months before i flew to her and make it official. During this trip we some boundaries/ guidelines for us

One - our first priority is our individual self growth. We will work together and create a space for each of us to grow independently in.

Two - we have sit down ever week to go over our feeling and how we acted in our relationship that week.

Three - COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE

The beginning was great. I still think there was a lot of oooo and ahhh emotions going on. We talked basically any chance we had. Then after two months i started to notice red flags. Started off with her asking me to update her with every i was doing before i did it. She would get very upset if i didnt tell her or if she was sleeping i went to the store without telling her. We talked about this and she explained she has past trauma and anxiety that makes her feel like this. I asked if having a location app on my phone would help and she said it might. I downloaded one immediately and shared it with her. The following months she got better and is becoming less and less worried about it.

Month 3

Due to my job sometimes i get opportunities to go out with clients. When these events do happen they are spontaneous. I will tell her inform her what is going on. If her and i have something scheduled i will pass on the opportunity or reschedule with the client. When i do go to these events i always get answers like ""fine i guess we arent gonn talk tonight"" or ""ok ill talk to you tomorrow than"". Then she will put her phone on not DD and wont text me back for hours. The best one was "" if i cant have all your attention then i want none of it"" i was out with a client and made frequent stops that allowed me to text her in-between. She didnt like that and sent me thatm I had a conversation with her about this behavior. I felt like she was shamming me for not talking to her and not giving her all my time. She apologized for doing this. Explained it made her jealous that i got to do all this fun stuff without her and all she did was sit at home and go to work. I brought up if we could look into clubs or groups for her to go to in her free time. She told me she doesnt have time and she will think about it. I told her i am here to help her and support her but she needs to take the first step into looking into filling her free time with fun stuff to do. We havent had a conversation since about it. When these events happen now she will just say ""have a goodnight"" and reply with half hearted answers till she feels better¬†

Month 4

Towards the beginning of the relationship she asked for help with budgeting her money. When i first dated her she was super frugal. Now she spends money like its going out of style. She makes almost the same as me but has almost no bills to pay. She gets into these mini buying addictions over a certain brand of things. I helped her create a budget to help her notice and track what she is spending her money on. She decided how much she wanted to spend and how much she wanted to save. I just did the calculations. This was going great until she she started saying ""your gonna be mad at me"" all the time. I kepts asking what she ment and she wouldn't tell just smile at me. I figured out it was her telling me she went over budget. Then when i would ask for her credit card amounts i noticed the numbers she was giving me werent adding up. This is her money so i dont care how she spends it. I had no access to her accounts i just helped her with calculating. I brought up the credit cards and she admitted to maxing them out to buys stiff she liked. She said she needed me to tell her to stop spendig her money on these things. I told her it would be impossible for me to stop her from making these purchases. I cant always be monitoring her and i dont want to be monitoring her nonstop. I told her if she is thinking about making a purchase give it a day then come to the conclusion. She told me she hates herself because she does this. After a little of calming down i brought up the idea of maybe seeing a therapist to help identify why you doing this and to have a better system to try and stop yourself in the future. She just said ""i will never go to therapy"" Couple weeks later she tells me she was maxing using loan programs to buy stuff without telling me. She said she didnt want me to be mad at her. I explained to her its not my money and that im not mad at her. Im upset she did this hiding it from me and pointed out how this was a bad behavior. This started a fight with her saying shes buying some of this stuff for me so i shouldn't say anything"" i told her immediately, no this stuff isnt for me. I told her i think its nice of her to think of me while purchasing some of this but i havent agreed to have you buy this stuff for me or told you i wanted any of this. She got angry and went through a depressive episode. Once through that. She started stop and has been working really hard not to spend her money on things she doesnt need. Shes doing an amazing job. We have a meeting twice a month to go over Expenses and she is achieving all her goals¬†

Month 5

This one is is eventful. Starting out with her parents want her and i to get married. The idea was floated about her moving in with me. We thought it was a great idea but there significant time before this can happen due to personal reason. She told her parents and coworkers of the idea of is moving in. Her parents immediately said they want her to be married before it she moved. Which i can understand. She will be moving very far away from home. To a place with no family and no friends. Idk the situation but its like they think its gonna happen tomorrow and badger her all the time asking when she is going to get married. Then her coworkers found out, her mom and her work in the same circles. Now all her coworkers are asking when she will get married. She asked me my opinion and prefaced this by saying dont guys know with in 2 months if they want to marry a woman. I explained yes some times but their are other factors that have to be ironed out before you make that commitment. I went on to explain how i wasnt comfortable marrying her for the situation of her moving in with me. Plus i think her moving in is 1-2 years down the road. This isnt something we have to rush. She was upset about this answer and told me she understood. Couple days later asked me why dont we just get engaged for now and later on get married. I told her no i still wasnt comfortable with this at this moment. She has expressed to me she likes the idea of getting married and having kids soon. Before starting this relationship i explained to her i dont want to have kids for the next few years. When i brought this up She told me she was having a headache and wanted to talk later about this. Later this month we went on a trip together. On this trip we met up with my best friend and his fiance. It was great overall. Her and I got to spend lots of alone time together. Semi see how we acted together. Then got to explore the city with another couple. Overall i thought it was a great trip till the last day. I woke up before her. I went to start the coffee when i noticed her phone on the coffee table next to the couch. I picked it up thinking it needed charged. When i looked i saw lots of notifications from a social media app. I know this was wrong but i started to think there was a couple times on the trip that she wasnt paying attention and just smiling at her phone. I opened her phone and saw there was tons of other guys she was friends with. They were all saying how hot she was and i noticed recent chats, no messages and they been friends for a long time. I didnt know how to feel. None of it was her out right flirting but i know she is at least seeking attention from other people and hiding things from me. I locked her phone and plugged it in. 5 minutes later she woke up came out and was looking for her phone. I didnt bring it up¬†Later that day while taking her to the airport. She started saying all these small things like ""your happy im leaving huh"" and ""my friends are gonna ask why we didnt do more"". Once she was on the flight i went to go out with my friend. There was a event going on the next day that my friend invited me to. So i extended my trip by one day. When i told my gf this she said she was right. I was just waiting for her to leave. That i just hate her and wanted her gone the entire time. We didnt do anything she wanted and spent all our time with the other couple. I got angry and told her i was angry. I hope she gets home safe and ill talk to her the next day. My phone proceed to blow up with other nasty messages. I didnt look at them. I saw she posted on social media how her trip was ruined. I put my on silent and went to sleep. When i woke up around the time she was getting home. I told her im happy she got home safe. Hope she gets some rest before working and ill text her when im free. I was still very mad at her and needed time to understand and communicate my feeling properly to her. I talked to my best friend about it and He told me anytime i left to do somethings. She wouldn't talk to them and only give one word responses. I was mad she was willing to say that is how i felt about her when i have shown her nothing but love and support. Then to criticize my best friend and his fiance saying they werent including her. Even though they went out of their way multiple times. This trip we had in advance. We didnt want to tire ourself out so we moderately filled out scheduled and yes most of the days we spent time with my best friend and his fiance because they are from the area amd were basically our tour guides. We had a conversation about it a day later. I asked her to listen and ask questions. I want her to hear and understand my feelings. Ive always done this for her every time she is mad. Once i started talking she got defensive and wanted to explain her side of the story. We basically just said our 2 sides of the story and left it at that. She said none of it was her fault. The issue wasnt resolved but it felt like i couldn't do anymore to fix it.¬†

Month 6

I start getting really busy with work and her schedule starts to collide with mine. We are planning dates once a week. Everyday good morning goodnight everyday with messages inbetween. Then one day at work she has a panic attack. I am currently in the middle of something and i cant look at my phone or someone can get hurt. As soon as im done i call her back about 30 minutes later. She sounds emotionless. Sayins she fine. She doesnt need me. Hangs up. Later that night she explains because we are long distance i cant help her wither panic attacks. I cant comfort her or help her deal with it. I explained to her that i will try my best to support her but there is so much we can do. Once emotions calmed down i brought up therapy again. She said sure and gave me her info. I asked her for us but doesnt think it will help. Ive been trying to help her set it up but she wont even start the processm i asled her a few days later if she wanted me to set some time aside to help her set up an account and start looking for a therapist and she just said why i thought you were doing all of it. Later She started having dreams of me cheating on her. These dreams crank her anxiety up to 11. When she wakes up it takes about 3 hours before we can have a normal conversation because she is mad at me. She asked me for more reassurance and affirmation because she goings through this. We talk in the morning, I give her tons of love and affirmation and reassurance make little videos during the day and at night basically repeat what i do in the morning. She keeps bringing up she wants a note. The first time i wrote her one and she said it felt too responsive. Ive tried to write more but i will admit im having a hard time writing them. I still call her as much as possible. I get a text last night from her while im sleeping about how she wants to be my number 1 priority. That she has always done that for others and no one has ever done it for her. Her exs always taken advantage of her. We had a conversation about it. I told her she would made a rule that we would always put our own self first before each other so we both grow. I asked her questions what she ment by #1 priority. She explained that she wants to be taken care of. I was asking more questions to understand better but it became a circular explanation then said she had a headache and forgot. Then asked if we could talk about this later.

¬†Apologies again for the long read. I wanted to explain as much detail as i can all the situations. I really love my gf, we have lot of fun most the time! Its like we are super in sync and just know each other very well. i think she can grow! Im just starting to have doubts and feel like im starting to be trapped. I try to write her notes but i think she just wants me to confess my undying love for her and how i will never leave. With these new thoughts in my head its for me to write that without being guilty.¬†¬†I feel like Im getting back to our old relationship and having to do everything.

I've always had some pretty bad heartburn, more so in the last 5 years. Sometimes bad enough to vomit. The beginning of this year it turned into real bad chest pain. I thought I was having a heart attack. I toughed it out for a few weeks and eventually got too scared and went to ER. Ran all the tests, heart was good, they said Gerd and to see my doctor. 

I hate doctors, I really do. (No offense if you are one)

I decided I needed to get my act together if I didn't want to have to keep going to many more doctors. Diet over haul but the biggest things were no more coffee and no more food after dinner. Bye bye night time snacks :( 
Then I started mild exercise outside my daily activity. Just a few miles walking each night after dinner. 

I'm sitting here tonight realizing I haven't had pain or even heartburn in over a month now. I don't have anything revolutionary to say but don't discount getting your diet cleaned up and a little exercise. ",6,1759714966.0,GERD,2,0.88,False

- the pay they offered me is $2 less an hour than what i was making as an ssv in 2022... with 5 years of ssv tenure up to that point... i'm going to talk to my dm because this happened when i got rehired on back in april. what should i do if they deny my request for my old rate?

- i've been seeing a lot of crazy situations lately regarding policy and how we're supposed to handle things. did you guys see that video that went around about a lady who went off on a barista because she wouldn't say ""charlie kirk"", which was the name the customer had asked to be put on the cup? 

- my store is interesting. a lot of my coworkers don't like my manager but he's a cool guy who tries his best and does what he can to support us. he definitely lacks in some areas leadership wise, but i respect him. there's a little bit of beef and a few people have reported each other for harassment and we're understaffed but still skating by. even though we're wild, we have it pretty good. i've worked at 4 stores over my tenure and have picked up shifts on the app a few times. like i said earlier... compared to some of the stores i'm hearing about on here... we're blessed fr.

- are you guys happy? i loved working with this company from when i started in 2017 until about 2022/23... COVID was something else, but it brought my team closer together as we all learned how to navigate all the changes. a little before brian took over, i just haven't been feeling much joy during my shifts.

- i get that we're trying to bring ""coffeehouse culture"" back to our stores, and i think we do a great job at that simply by being kind and acknowledging customers... but it's not happening. it will never happen. starbucks is such a huge chain now, and in reality we are a fast-food business. 

-they want us to be genuine, efficient, keep morale up, navigate many challenges like it's no problem, provide a five star experience to every person that walks through our door, directly hand beverages and food items to customers (key moment #4 and i will never agree... i'm not going to stand there and wait to hand off a drink when i have 20 others in queue... sorry not sorry. 


i don't know guys. i want to do something different and that i'm actually passionate about. i like connecting with people but i don't care about coffee. (it tastes good though.)

what do you guys think?

So for the past couple of months I simply stopped splitting when I paid because I felt like my partner deserves a treat every now and then and I thought I should bring it up with them too. 

My partner somehow got offended and started asking me questions like ‚ÄúOh so you want me to pay for everything? Why would I do that?‚Äù I just said forget it. Today I noticed my partner paid for lunch and dinner. I thought it was very nice of them, I said thank you but the response to that was ‚Äúoh sure you wanted me to pay for everything anyways.

But there are still some nice, wholesome people out there - so this post is me trying to keep an open mind. Maybe a sensitive, fellow arts patron?

This is sincere and what I‚Äôm honestly seeking (the basics). I need genuine ideas and help folks. I think this person is kind, nerdy, bookish yet creative and cultured. Please share how you met your partner (any gender) iydm.

With so many assh\*les and scammers out there, I want to make sure our environment is safe so I appreciate it if you read until the end. Thanks!

Anyway, let's see if we will work out. To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety:** I will be posting a DOWNLOAD link for some of my (SFW) pictures here. Just so you really know what I look like and that you can trust me. So if you still want me based on those pictures, just simply DM me. Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

\- Must be willing to really show interest and not waste time (this goes to what I said above. If you can't reply to messages within 24-48 hours, say so instead of staying silent or else that's considered GHOSTING and I'll say my goodbyes to you)  
\- Must NOT be too nonchalant (If you don't really care about getting together and being my date, why are you even here?)  
\- Must not be too sensitive (I love making people laugh so if you're the type to easily get offended, we're NOT gonna get along)  
\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover  
\- Hopefully, you also value loyalty  
\- Hopefully, you also have good libido (This is non-negotiable for me. bedroom chemistry is extremely important in a relationship. If you are boring in bed and have low bedroom drive, we're NOT gonna get along)

For anyone interested, feel free to send me DMs any time! I admit this might come off as a job application but that's only because I don't want any scammers or fraud ruining our experience. After all, we want genuine connections at the end of the day. I'll do my best to accommodate you.

See you soon! :D

1nz62e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_InhabitStewart/comments/1nz62e8/how_strategic_media_management_transforms_your/,How Strategic Media Management Transforms Your Property Business,"Look, a lot of hosts and agents hit me up and they‚Äôre all asking the same thing: ""What's the one thing I can do to get more bookings or sell my house faster?"" And they always assume the answer is to just go get some fancy photos.

Honestly, that's just the starting line, not the finish line.

The truth is, having good photos is table stakes now. The real secret isn't just taking great photos and video; it's what you do with them. We call it **strategic media management**, but really it‚Äôs just about turning your property visuals from a one-time expense into a workhorse that actively makes you money.

Think of it like this. There are three tiers to getting this right, and you‚Äôve got to figure out which one you‚Äôre ready for.

# Tier 1: Just Give Me the Goods

This is the most basic level, and it‚Äôs where everyone starts. You need high-quality content‚Äîthe photos, the videos, the drone shots, all of it. This is your foundation. And the data on this is wild. For realtors, properties with pro photos sell a third faster and can get you over a hundred grand more on the sale price.  For STR hosts, it's the same story. Professional photos can boost your earnings by 40% and let you charge 20% more a night.  It‚Äôs not just a marketing thing; it‚Äôs a business thing.

# Tier 2: Building a Brand, Not Just a Listing

This is where you get smart. You've got the content, now you need to put it to work consistently. This is where you get off the ""photo dump"" strategy and start thinking about your social media. Here's the kicker: don't just post pictures of your property. People don‚Äôt book a house; they book an experience.

We use an 80/20 rule: 80% of what we post for clients is about the local area. The best coffee shop, a little-known hiking trail, a cool restaurant. The other 20% is the property itself.  This positions you as a local expert and builds a brand people trust. When you‚Äôre consistent with this, you can see a huge bump in brand recognition and even a 23-33% increase in revenue.

# Tier 3: Owning Your Future

This is for the hosts and owners who want to get off the booking platform rollercoaster. You‚Äôve got the content, you‚Äôre building a brand, and now you build a direct booking website and a blog. The goal is simple: you create a place to send people that you own.

This is the big leagues. You get to cut out those nasty OTA commissions, which can be anywhere from 8-15%.That‚Äôs real money you keep on every single booking. More importantly, you stop being just another listing and start being a **real brand.** That direct relationship with your guests is the most valuable asset you can build. It‚Äôs what makes your business resilient to all the crazy changes the platforms throw at you.

We do this with our Inhabit Method. It's a system to make sure every photo is working for you, not just sitting on a gallery. It‚Äôs about building a predictable, revenue-generating machine. You‚Äôre not just showing your space; you‚Äôre telling a story, building a community, and securing your position as the premium choice in your market.",1,1759714205.0,u_InhabitStewart,0,1.0,False
1nz61x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nz61x7/aita_for_cancelling_plans_with_my_longtime_friend/,AITA for cancelling plans with my long-time friend after she refused to come to my house because her boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with it?,"I (M) have a long-time best friend (F), that I‚Äôve known for around 10 years. We‚Äôve been through a lot together ‚Äî her relationships, heartbreaks, high school and university graduation, the launch of her book, everything. We‚Äôve always stayed close, even though we now live about 200 km apart and only see each other maybe twice a year.

Some time ago, on a Friday, since I was home from work, I invited her to grab a coffee and catch up. She said she couldn‚Äôt that day because she had to go shopping in a town 30 minutes away, but she could do the next evening. Fine.

The next day she texted saying she‚Äôd be back earlier than expected, so I invited her to come over instead ‚Äî we could hang out by my new pool, I could make us cocktails, or we could just have coffee there if she preferred.

She immediately said no, explaining that her boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with her going to another guy‚Äôs house, that she didn‚Äôt want to make him jealous, and that she also wouldn‚Äôt like him to go to another girl‚Äôs place alone either.

I‚Äôll be honest, it hurt. She‚Äôs been to my house before, I‚Äôve been to hers, and this was never an issue with any of her previous boyfriends. I‚Äôve always respected her relationships, and I‚Äôm in one too ‚Äî so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs the only one with a partner. To me, trust should be a part of any relationship.

I told her she‚Äôs absolutely within her right to not want to make her boyfriend uncomfortable, but I‚Äôm also within mine to feel hurt by that choice. I ended up cancelling everything because it just didn‚Äôt feel right after that.

AITA for cancelling plans after she refused to come over?



Edit: This left a bad taste in my mouth as this was a couple months ago and we haven't talked since.
She's my best friend, and I really want us to meet, wherever, and catch up with her but every time I think about calling her I can't help but feel a bit hurt again.",1,1759714166.0,AITAH,9,0.6,False

I‚Äôd like to start this with I‚Äôm not a big reddit user I‚Äôm just looking for some extra options to this situation. This is going to be a long one as I want to give some background.

I left due to not wanting to be treated the way I had been for most of the relationship. I was in my opinion housewife and breadwinner for more then half of our relationship , I would clean the house, feed and clean our cats, do the food shopping daily because planning for meals was a nightmare trying to figure out what she would want on a schedule because she couldn‚Äôt knows ‚Äúif she would feel like it‚Äù and I payed for EVERYTHING until my bank account was empty and she was the only one with money, then she would tell me I‚Äôm irresponsible with money even though I hadn‚Äôt bought myself anything in a very long time. 

I was working more but couldn‚Äôt work as much as I wanted to as we shared a car and ‚Äúneeded days off together to hang out‚Äù even thought on those days I would be me doing all of the chores and she would be in her gaming room most likely doing nothing but wait for a friend to jump on which was usually in the afternoon. I didn‚Äôt work weekends but I still had to wake us both up, I‚Äôd get up first to make her a coffee, then get the cats their breakfast and start tidying while she sat in bed on twitch, I do admit as our relationship was reaching the end I was becoming very sick of this routine. 
I would wait for her to get out of bed and get ready 30 minutes before her work starts. It happened every day she had work I‚Äôd have to help with checking the whole house to help her OCD, I‚Äôd go around checking all wall sockets making sure everything was plugged in properly or unplugging anything that didn‚Äôt need to be plugged in check were all 3 cats were and make sure all the doors in the hallway were shut, while she goes to all the back doors and tugs on the multiple times to help her brain be sure they are locked. (I understand OCD is a very painful thing to deal with but I never had to do these things and one days she snapped and asked for my help so I did it just to ease her mind) I couldn‚Äôt do it earlier or quicker because if I was waiting at the door while she was still working on the doors she would ask me to go do it all again, then ask me were all the cats were so she could go say bye to them (running so very late for her job) then we exit the house and I have to help with the front door. Finally we would get in the car and I would be yelled at for being a ‚Äúmute‚Äù, if this upset me I would get called a ‚Äúchild or stupid‚Äù or get told I‚Äôm playing victim. Once our drive was over I would have to go get her lunch and then I could drive myself back home and start doing the household chores. And finally I‚Äôd have to drive myself back to her work and pick her up ( side note we both have our license she just didn‚Äôt want to do the drive by herself). 

On days we both worked I‚Äôd be at my job at 7:45am leave at 6pm head over to her work help them clean and leave around 8pm (they close at 7pm) head home and discuss what dinner would be get groceries at 9:45 and start cooking dinner. After all of this if I was to flop and the bed and start scrolling TikTok I‚Äôd be told I‚Äôm doing nothing good for my brain and I look brain dead while scrolling and I need to find something else to do even though I had another massive day and and just wanted to numb out until I passed out and could get some sleep, she would wake me up and ask me to wait for her while she played one more game ( which normally lead to 3-4 more) then make us teas for bed I would wait for it to cool then chug it but get told not to as teas are fir sipping them get asked to give her full body scratches if I refused due to my body shutting down and just wanting to shut my fucking eyes is get an ear full about not wanting to touch her. She would sometimes pull the sex card which would make me open my eyes and she would say something along the line of ‚Äúoh and that would wake you up huh‚Äù mind you the only time I never knew how long times were between us having sex, the only time I knew when the last time we had done anything was my birthday (March) and the next time we did anything was September. So yes I felt she used it against me, sometimes she would talk to me about why she wasn‚Äôt in the mood ever and it would either be that she just had a very low sex drive and didn‚Äôt want to do anything unless she felt she was in the mood or it just wasn‚Äôt going to be worth it for both of us, or on the occasion she would tell me she felt repulsed by me and would find it hard to not think about my past sexual experiences. Just a little FYI if you haven‚Äôt done the maths yet, we had gotten in a relationship when I was 16. 

There were a few times she tried to break up with me and I was fucking pathetic and begged her not too because ‚ÄúI would change‚Äù she wanted me to get better and communicating about how I felt but I always had problems with talking about what was bothering me ( that come from family trauma as if any fights ever happened between my parents and I the next day everyone would act like it never happened) 
I always gave her benefit of the doubt but knew the way she would talk to me while I was crying wasn‚Äôt okay, she would belittle and call me a sorry excuse for a person but what would I do and were would I go. We lived in her mother‚Äôs owned house (not on the lease but paying her rent) and I didn‚Äôt own a car, and wouldn‚Äôt get the cats so I‚Äôd need to change quickly or I‚Äôd have nothing. 

The breaking point was seriously so stupid of a fight but I had been called all the names that week and when she walked in yelling that I don‚Äôt listen to her and didn‚Äôt see what she was asking of me, I fucking snapped I called my brother who they both fucking hated each. My brother for the way she treated me and her for me not standing up to him and defending her in the fucking beginning of our relationship. 
I knew if I was to call him he would never let me come back, while I was on the phone with him I was packing my things and when he arrived I told her he was coming in to help me grab stuff and we would be on our way, the seconds exited the house to get him the door was locked behind me and I had to wait outside for her mother and sister to arrive. I told them I needed all the garbage bags of clothes in the room and a few belongings I‚Äôd desperately needed, the key to the house was taken from my key chain and told to collect my things ASAP and to talk with her when I‚Äôve calmed down. 

I came over about a month later to collect more of my belongings and she was just sad asking me to take time and work on myself so we could come back together stronger then ever, I just kept repeating ‚Äúthis IS a break up and I will be working on myself but not for her benefit‚Äù
She told me she wouldn‚Äôt give up. When I was trying to get the rest of my things she kept asking if she could hold onto certain things a little while longer like my teddy as he gave good cuddles I was over being there so I just said yes. I was also living in a small government flat with my two brothers so couldn‚Äôt take everything as I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to put it all.

My plan was work as much as I could save up buy and car and start looking for a bigger house my two brothers and I could move into has the flats were not suitable for anyone of us to be living in ( domestic violence upstairs and a man who was always screaming who lived right across from us) I was dealing with seeing a councillor in my free time and working a minimum of 6 days a week. I got the car at the 3 month point and at the 5 month points we got approved for a house. 3 days after moving in messaged her to collect the rest of my belongings, didn‚Äôt get a response so I messaged her mother asking her as my old landlord, could she help me retrieve my belongings, I was told I‚Äôd have to wait for her to be ready as it would be very difficult for her as this is my first time making contact in months and if need to be patient with her. I had told my ex the first time I went back to get the first batch of my things that I would let her know when I‚Äôve moved as I‚Äôd have space for the rest of my belongings and that‚Äôs exactly what I did. 

I got in contact with legal advice and was told to send an itemised email with everything I wanted back as well as a time frame of when I would need them by I put her and her mother in the email and got nothing from my ex but a rather long email from her mother stating I have been irresponsible with my belongings, this email would be inflammatory when my ex reads it, they could have disposed of my belongings and I would get my stuff but on her time frame and not mine. It‚Äôs been I month since I originally asked for a time to get my stuff.

I spoke with legal advice again and they told me I can dispute my belongings with the court but am being hesitant to do so as I just want this to be handled outside of that but I‚Äôm growing impatient with the situation and am starting to this I should just do it. The people I have around me all just want me to message her and tell her to let me go and move on with her life, they all think that this is her last chance to manipulate me and she will hold onto it as long as possible. 

What would you do in my situation I‚Äôm very close to making a claim for my stuff back with the court but I never thought I would have to do that, does it sound like my only option as nobody is replying to me anymore. I just need some advice on what my next move should be.

I've always been physically fit and normal blood pressure until around the pandemic, at which point I was around 30 years old. During that time I did a trifecta of stupid things, of being relatively sedentary, using adderal, and drinking in excess. I gained some weight and loss some muscle in the process, this continued for around 2-3 years(No excuse- Yes it was incredibly stupid and yes I've fully learned my lesson at this point).

Sometime in those years, during my physical my dr noted elevated BP, I don't remember the numbers but they weren't ""meds now"" levels, but more ""make some healthy changes and if things haven't changed we'll put you on meds"" level. While I did make some healthy changes, I didn't fully cease my poor behaviors or earnestly get into shape, and sure enough I ended up on losartan.

At that point it was a reality check and I got my shit together across the board. Zero adderal, cold turkey on drinking, and hitting the gym a minimum of 5 times a week. To no ones surprise I started feeling better across the board, and gained my old muscle back while shredding off 30 pounds of fat I'd accumulated. When I went to the dr.'s my BP was either normal or in one case pretty low.

However when I've taken my own BP I have gotten some pretty high results, particularly systolic , like 150/90 ballpark. At a certain point this caused me to dread even taking my readings since it felt like a cycle of getting myself stressed over it and getting worse readings when measuring again as a result.

Most recently when I went to an urgent care for an unrelated issue, my reading was 160/100 - Which despite not having had my meds close to the appointment, and having had a coffee is not remotely ideal, obviously, and thus that brings me here. 

Has anyone else gone through something similar and was there a way out for you? I'm worried I've done long term damage in those couple years of poor behavior. At this point I only drink once or twice a month on date nights, and energy drinks/coffee. The last thing I'm throwing at the wall to see if it sticks is quitting the energy drinks altogether, and moving to one cup of coffee a day, and then reducing that, and instead of just the 40 minutes or so of walking I do for cardio, starting to build up my jogging endurance as well and adding that to the daily exercise- But I am all ears for advice.",1,1759713747.0,hypertension,2,1.0,False
1nz5wme,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nz5wme/gf_broke_up_with_me_this_past_friday_a_lot_of/,GF broke up with me this past Friday. A lot of possessions in my apartment are from her.,"A good amount of dishes, organizers, a spice rack, a lot of kitchen stuff.

The TV in my living room. The coffee table. Some decor. A good amount of artwork.

Bathroom items (towels, organizers for medicine, cleaning supplies etc).

Wall mount for bedroom TV. A few more things.

This break up was a long time in the making. I'm glad it happened finally, as it is best for both of us. But I can't help but feel horribly guilty and awful whenever I'm home because of all of these possessions around me that, in a sense to me, have her name attached. I feel like I don't deserve any of it.

For context, when I got the apartment, half of the items she got for me unprompted because she's always had the belief that she wanted people to feel comfortable in their own space. The other half for gifts for birthday and Christmas.

1nz5s0y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nz5s0y,Trying Every Sorce Fragrance- Day 8,"The wheel has chosen 2 am in Lafayette and The Cookie Party as my day 8 test. After applying it to my skin (one in the morning and one in the evening) and letting it settle for 3 hours, here is my review.

\*Notes: Photos are taken directly from Sorce's website/ Google for special orders. The bottle's designs may be outdated compared to current.

\*Special Order scents can only be ordered on their website 4x a year. The next window is this weekend 3rd-5th.

Morning: 2 am in Lafayette 

What it smells like: The night still clings to you as you drive east, headlights cutting through the fog. Somewhere behind you, that haunted hotel still breathes, its silence too heavy to forget. By dawn, you stop at a roadside caf√© in Mississippi. The air smells of warm beignets and milky coffee, caramel melting into vanilla. Steam drifts like a ghost through the air. It‚Äôs comfort after fear, sweetness layered over the strange hush of the night that followed you there.

My opinion: A sweet, creamy, yummy latte paired with beignets. This, coupled with the caramel, is absolutely delicious. I dont't really get any earthiness /oakmoss like in the notes, but it isn't a cloying sweet fragrance. The main focus here is definitely on the beignets and caramel, with the latte in the background.

BF‚Äôs opinion: Smells toasted, he likes it

Would we wear it: I would

Would we buy it: Yes

Rated: I give it a 10/10, he gives it a 7.4/10

Evening: The Cookie Party

What it smells like: The bell over the bakery door jingles as you step inside. The air is thick with the sweet scent of melted toffee, warm cocoa, and marshmallow cream. Coconut flakes glimmer like snow on trays of pecan shortbread, their buttery edges just beginning to brown. You order one cookie. You can taste the warmth before it reaches your tongue. It tastes like happiness baked fresh every hour. You order a dozen more.

My opinion: This just smells like a straight-up bakery. It is very sweet, almost a bit cloying. Very heavy cookie butter note, and also smells a tad lactonic for me. I get a nice powdered sugar note that softens the fragrance. Overall very yummy again (Sorce is just turning out to be a very yummy house it seems)

BF‚Äôs opinion: Smells like a sweet cream soda

Would we wear it: I would

Would we buy it: Yes

Rated: 7.9/10

‚ÄúFind My Way‚Äù is a track from 2020 album ‚ÄúMcCartney III‚Äú. While there was no formal single released, ‚ÄúFind My Way‚Äù had a single-like treatment, with stickers ‚ÄúFeaturing Find My Way‚Äù added to the ‚ÄúMcCartney III‚Äù LPs and CDs, and¬†a promotional video directed by Roman Coppola.

""Paul had a lot of fun working on this track in his home studio. He had recorded two different drum tracks, and added two different bass parts. Paul then recorded a number of guitar parts onto a Brenell 1/4‚Ä≥ reel-to-reel tape machine, capturing some at different tape speeds. These guitar loops were then arranged and layered into the track.""-From Spotify Storyline. Storyline is a feature of Spotify that gives behind-the-scenes information from artists about their songs, presented with a carousel of cards featuring a combination of text and images.

Q: On ‚ÄúFind My Way‚Äù, you say, ‚ÄúYou never used to be / Afraid of days like these / But now you‚Äôre overwhelmed / By your
anxieties‚Äù

Paul: That was written at the beginning of lockdown. It was a very scary time. Other scares we‚Äôve had ‚Äì SARS, avian flu ‚Äì they seemed to happen to other people. But this was happening to everyone, people you knew, everyone in the world. Some of my friends, some people I knew were close to going under with it.-UNCUT interview, January 2021


""I was thinking about people who worry more than I do. And I know one or two people which are just kind-of worried about life. And it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just that I deal with those worries and think ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs ok, there‚Äôs a way out of this‚Äù and I can generally find some optimistic exit from a bad situation. But there are some people who do get overwhelmed with it. So I think I was adressing those people and thinking ‚Äúyou never used to be so anxious but now you are, so let me be your guide, let me help you, to find the love that is inside you‚Äù it just felt like a natural thing to say. So that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about. The rest of the song is me saying ‚ÄúI can find my way, I know my left and right‚Äù ""-Paul McCartney, interview with¬†The Adam Buxton Podcast, December 11, 2020


Idris Elba: Have you ever written verses that you‚Äôve listened to and you‚Äôve gone 'I‚Äôm not interested in that' and redone the whole thing?

Paul: Yeah, one of the songs I‚Äôd forgotten that happened with this song, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúFind My Way‚Äù. And I had the chorus ‚ÄúI can find my way, I know my left from right. No, I don‚Äôt get lost at night‚Äù. So that was like a positive. You know, ‚ÄúI can do it‚Äù type-of verse. And then I had some rubbish stuff about going on holiday with someone and it didn‚Äôt work out. And she left and it was like‚Ä¶ it was terrible. And so I came back and wipe it all that bit and put another middle int it, which is better.- interview¬†with Idris Elba for BBC1, December 19, 2020

""I started this on the piano and it was based on an idea that I‚Äôd had in the car, and I was listening to music and there was a beat on the radio that I liked, so I just started singing along with it but making up my own words and tune. So that was started in the car, then I wrote it when I got home on the piano, and took it into the studio and it actually had a whole other idea for the verses which I didn‚Äôt like, so I eventually put in a new idea which is the middle now, [sings]¬†‚Äúyou never used to be afraid of days like these‚Äù. So I think that was much better than the original idea.""-Paul McCartney, from¬†NME, December 23, 2020


""For Find My Way we used a quarter-inch Brenell tape machine. It‚Äôs got a speaker built into it, Paul will record a lick into it, and then we‚Äôll play it back at different speeds through the speaker. We‚Äôve got a tape loop set up with a tape reel the lid of a coffee can so you get a continuous loop. It‚Äôs got a sound-on-sound mode where it lifts the tape away from the record head so you can have a couple of different sounds playing at the same time. Then when you put it into playback mode you can play it at different speeds and get different octaves. We‚Äôll record that into Pro Tools and edit them up.""-Steve Orchard, from¬†interview with MusicRadar, December 2020

""There‚Äôs Moog bass on Deep Down, and also on Find My Way the bass switches between the Hofner and the Moog, sort of intersecting in different sections of the song. We use the Moog a fair bit.""-Steve Orchard, from¬†interview with MusicRadar, December 2020

Alright, let‚Äôs keep it real for a second. You ever find yourself buzzing with ambition first thing in the morning, only to feel like a deflated balloon by lunchtime? Just me? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Honestly, it‚Äôs like a magic trick‚Äîpoof! One minute you‚Äôre ready to conquer the world, and the next, you‚Äôre slumped over your keyboard contemplating what you‚Äôd do if you could hibernate until spring. 

Well, let me share a little secret: you don‚Äôt have to stay in that midday slump. A few quick habits can turn your day around and boost your energy without needing a double shot of espresso (though I won‚Äôt judge if you need one, too! ‚òïÔ∏è). 

### Here‚Äôs the deal‚Äî**The 10-Second Habit Stack**!

1. **Power Pose**: Take a moment to stand tall with your arms up like you just scored the winning goal. Seriously, your body language can pump you full of confidence. Just don‚Äôt do this in an elevator‚Äîawkward! üòÇ

2. **Mini Dance Break**: Crank up your favorite jam (even if it‚Äôs a little embarrassing to admit) and dance like nobody‚Äôs watching. Trust me, a 10-second shimmy can do wonders. Bonus points for including some silly moves!

3. **Deep Breath**: Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a moment, then exhale through your mouth like you‚Äôre blowing away your worries. It‚Äôs like a mini reset button. üåÄ

4. **Chug Water**: Seriously, grab your water bottle and take a few gulps. Dehydration can zap your energy faster than a bad breakup. Maybe add a slice of lemon‚Äîfancy, right?

5. **Gratitude Check**: Think of one thing you‚Äôre grateful for in that moment. It can be as simple as a good cup of coffee or your co-worker‚Äôs terrible dad jokes that make you laugh. A little perspective goes a long way!

6. **Quick Stretch**: Take 10 seconds to stretch your arms above your head and wiggle your toes. Who knew freeing up those tight muscles could feel so energizing? 

7. **Affirmation Time**: Say something positive to yourself; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a rockstar at whatever I choose!‚Äù Think of it like your personal cheerleading squad, and guess what? YOU are the captain! üéâ

8. **Switch Gears**: If you‚Äôve been stuck on one task for too long, give yourself permission to switch it up. A change of scenery or task can renew your focus. 

9. **Vent for a Sec**: Sometimes it helps to voice what‚Äôs dragging you down (even if it‚Äôs just your friend on the other end of a text). Get it out, then let it go!

10. **Reflect for a Second**: Take just a moment to think about how you want the rest of your day to feel. Visualize it. You are in control, my friend! 

These 10-second habit stacks can be life-savers. I know it sounds wild to think something so quick can make a real difference, but sometimes it‚Äôs the little things that pile up and give us that unstoppable energy!

So, what‚Äôs your go-to habit when the midday slump hits? Let‚Äôs swap tips and find out what fuels your fire! üî•",1,1759713239.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I'm not sure if this would be weird or okay or something else, so I figured this might be the place to ask. My five-year college reunion is coming up quickly and would serve as an opportunity to rekindle an old friendship (should they also be interested in that). I've missed my ex-best friend for several years, but our relationship fallout was pretty big/uncomfortable and left us at a bit of an impasse.

For context, our fall out was over a guy in college. We both liked the same guy and I (without talking to her, very wrongly) started dating him. He's now my husband, so that worked out well for me, but also feels like it complicates matters. I reached out to her after the fact (about 6 months - 1 year after the initial issue) to apologize and let her know that I was extremely sorry for the way things went down and that I hoped that ill feelings wouldn't remain between us. I told her I respected her need for distance and wouldn't overstep her boundaries but that I hoped we could be friendly/civil with one another. She accepted my apology.

Since then, we haven't really spoken. We've dm'd occasionally on social media about books/politics, but rarely actually speak. She has sent old posts/photos and mentioned missing those moments, but I don't feel right trying to impose my feelings or nostalgia on it with her. We quietly support creative moves we've individually made, but very little of it includes contact. I miss her deeply at times, especially around times when I know she might be returning to town or seeing people we used to be close with. My husband isn't a huge fan of her because of some things said in hurt/anger, but he is also supportive of the choices I make. 

All that to say, would it be okay for me to contact her and ask about grabbing a coffee/lunch/etc during our reunion, if she even comes? I don't really know if it would be appropriate or weird or even how to approach it if I were to. She's still in my phone contacts. And like I said, we do still DM occasionally. I just need general advice/how to approach this at all, if anyone has any. ",1,1759713155.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

I love talking about random stuff for hours especially politics!, sharing music, sending memes, or just having deep 2am conversations about life. I spend way too much time scrolling, drinking iced coffee, and daydreaming about travelling somewhere new (bonus points if you love talking about places you want to visit too).

I honestly don‚Äôt care where you‚Äôre from ‚Äî different perspectives make it more interesting. I just want someone who‚Äôs kind, open-minded, and actually replies instead of ghosting after two messages üòÖ

So yeah, if you‚Äôre chill and want to make a friend from a random little corner of Africa, send me a message and tell me something completely random about yourself üí´",1,1759713137.0,Kikpals,1,0.67,False

**A. Household Size:** It‚Äôs just me + my 2-year-old black cockapoo, who is very spoiled (and knows it üíÖ). I live in a VHCOL area.

**B. Health Info:** About 2.5 years ago, I had bariatric surgery ‚Äî best decision ever. My only regret is not doing it sooner. I‚Äôm still technically in the maintenance phase, but my doctor thinks I can lose a little more once my other health issue is resolved and I can get back to exercising the way I want. That said, I‚Äôve lost and maintained **over 120 lbs** üéâ.

**C. Eating Info:** I‚Äôm a hardcore believer in meal prep. I prep *everything* ‚Äî breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks. My cycle runs Sunday through Friday, with Saturday as my cheat day. This routine keeps me on track. I usually eat around **1600‚Äì1800 calories/day**.

**D. Money Info:** I budget about **$150/week for groceries** (since I eat 90‚Äì95% at home) and **$200/month for eating out**. Honestly, I‚Äôm happy with that balance.





# 2. Grocery Info

**A. Where I Shop:** Mostly Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods, and a few local stores within walking distance.

**B. Meal Routine:** By Wednesday, I‚Äôm already deep into researching recipes for the upcoming week. Cooking has become a genuine joy for me ‚Äî I‚Äôve started making my own jams with different fruits/flavors, roasting seeds with spices, and even baking (lots of trial and error there üòÖ). Honestly, someone needs to coin a phrase for the heartbreak of new bakers ‚Äî when you follow a recipe *exactly* and it still flops. It feels personal, lol.

# Meals üëç

**Breakfast:**

* Raspberry‚ÄìApple Maple Chia Jam (w/ hint of blueberry, homemade)  
* Roasted Maple Pumpkin Seeds (homemade)  
* Dark chocolate chips  
* Plain Greek yogurt + 1 tbs honey  

üí° I batch this into mason jars for grab-and-go breakfasts. The jam is mostly apple + raspberry with a few blueberries and warm spices. The pumpkin seeds are roasted with nutmeg, ginger, and maple syrup.

**Lunch:**

* Chipotle-style bowl with:  
   * Black beans  
   * Rice (homemade)  
   * Sweet corn (homemade)  
   * Salsa  
   * Chicken thigh (homemade)  
   * Mild guacamole  

This [recipe ](https://www.culinaryhill.com/chipotle-burrito-bowl-recipe/)is one of my all-time faves ‚Äî I make it at least once every other month. Perfect desk lunch too.

**Dinner:**

* Thai red curry lime wings (homemade)  
* Sweet potato fries  
* Spinach  

[Recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/thai-red-curry-lime-wings/) link included ‚Äî never fails, one of my repeat hits.

**Snack (Fruit):**

* Sugar snap peas  
* Candy grapes  
* Roasted Rosemary pumpkin seeds (homemade)  

Obsessed with this combo lately. The pumpkin is savory, the peas and grapes are sweet ‚Äî it just works. Been eating this almost daily for 2 months.

**Snack (Bake):**

* Sweet Cranberry‚ÄìOrange Soft Rolls (homemade)  

These came out sooo good. I usually have them with coffee or after dinner if I‚Äôm still a little hungry.





# Final Thoughts

This journey has taught me that I don‚Äôt mind eating the same foods on repeat if they‚Äôre ones I truly love. I also enjoy experimenting, even if it sometimes means kitchen fails (looking at you, random baking flops).

I know $600/month on groceries can sound like a lot, but this is just a peek into what eating looks like for me post-bariatric surgery, 2.5 years out. When I was researching, I saw tons of ‚Äú1 month, 6 months, 1 year‚Äù updates, but rarely what happens at the 2‚Äì3 year mark ‚Äî unless it was about weight regain. So, here‚Äôs one version of what *longer-term success* looks like.

I still have a lot of samples to test which I‚Äôll be working through in the coming months. I have some review ideas planned to keep things rolling, but for now I‚Äôll just enjoy the journey

and how I‚Äôll be ranking them

Rating:

	‚ÅÉ	0 - unspeakable, truly unwearable
	‚ÅÉ	1 - horrible, scrubber
	‚ÅÉ	2 - not enjoyable/not my cup of tea
	‚ÅÉ	3 - pleasant enough but nothing special
	‚ÅÉ	4 - interesting and compelling, would wear again
	‚ÅÉ	5 - amazing, show-stopping, brilliant

as always, samples were tested blind first and then notes were reviewed on the dry down

let the end begin :‚Äô)

**Mon Sep 29 - Wizard‚Äôs Library (Birch & Besom)** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the bottle - oh woah, it‚Äôs *way* lighter than I expected it to be. it almost smells like‚Ä¶ rain? not petrichor, but like cool, fresh water, running smooth over river rocks. there‚Äôs a grounded sweetness at the bottom as well

On skin - the grit of coffee grounds blooms over that cool, rainy sensation. it‚Äôs sweet, but only just so. it almost disappears on my skin which is a shame because it‚Äôs such a lovely scent. the throw is watered down simple syrup with a hint of something darker‚Ä¶ gingered molasses or brandy?? it‚Äôs very faint, whatever it is

Dry down - about 10 minutes in, the smooth water begins to flow over something fruity and almost floral. like the rest of the notes, it‚Äôs only hinted at‚Ä¶ blackberry maybe? and shaded flowers by the stream. it‚Äôs dark and cool and feels like dipping your toes in the cold creek, clambering over slippery rocks and breathing in the clean air. inky berry bushes rustle in the shadowed understory, dappled sunlight flickering on cream petals and dark leaves. I can‚Äôt stop smelling myself, but I wish it was 10x stronger

*Notes: Antique books, a smooth cup of hazelnut coffee, cedar desks, sandalwood, sweet tobacco*

Post notes - yeah I have NO idea what‚Äôs going on lmao‚Ä¶ [after reapplying] I def get the coffee, and I‚Äôm realizing the antique books + sweet tobacco are what‚Äôs uplifting the scent. it does kind of smell like a library? I guess? idk man it‚Äôs still lowkey watery to me. but whichever way you interpret it, it‚Äôs a very smooth scent. really lovely

good projection, ok sillage, ok longevity (note: projection is good but it‚Äôs a very mild scent, almost disappears on my skin)

just wish it was stronger or in an EDP format, 4.5/5 (but prob won‚Äôt FS unfortunately, due to how faint it is on me)





**Tues Sep 30 - Libidreams (Black Hearted Tart)** üç†

In the bottle - oh, it‚Äôs fruity, childlike and a bit nostalgic. for some reason Claire‚Äôs popped into mind haha

On skin - it‚Äôs very pink, very gummy. sweet, jammy fruit with a strong, tart punch on top. although, there‚Äôs an unpleasant staleness as well, like a residue left in your mouth after eating old candy. the throw is sugary juice and bubblegum

*Notes: Taro milk tea made with taro powder, coconut milk, black tea, and tapioca pearls is topped with¬†marshmallow fluff and drizzled with sweet violet and jasmine syrups*

Post notes - I think the taro powder doesn‚Äôt convey the rich earthy smell of taro like I‚Äôd want it to, instead just leaving that film on the tongue. still fun though, 2000s at the mall

good projection, good sillage, poor longevity

not sure when I‚Äôd wear this, 3/5



**Wed Oct 1 - Carnal (BPAL)** üçä

In the bottle - orange!! the kind of orange scent you‚Äôd find in soap or shampoo or air fresheners. very strong

On skin - that soap association stays for a little bit but ultimately lets up a bit, becoming a very juicy, bright mandarin orange. it‚Äôs super fresh: plump and dripping and sweet. this would be a great scent for summer, and it really blooms in the heat. created a perfect little bubble of orange juice around me

*Notes: Bold, bright mandarin paired with the sweet, sensual earthiness of fig*

Post notes - never explicitly got fig but I expect that note is probably what grounds the scent

*fantastic* projection, great sillage, fantastic longevity (lasted *all* day)

will be wearing in summer, 4/5



**Thurs Oct 2 - The Strange Proclivities of Mr. Dickens (Cirrus)** üéÑ

CANNOT!!!! open the bottle >:( Cirrus why‚Ä¶
update: may have used my teeth to open the bottle‚Ä¶ no comment‚Ä¶

In the bottle - smells (and tastes) like a wreath

On skin - very much boughs of fir and pine needles, like sticking your nose straight in a tree. welcome to christmas! winter is here and it smells like pine

Dry down - after a while, it starts to smell a bit orangey, like a heavy, dark blood orange

*Notes: Hot mulled red wine, flavored with cranberries, warm spices, and orange zest; layered over a traditional chypre perfume base, pipe tobacco, and woods*

Post notes - yeah idk where we went wrong :/ other than the orange I don‚Äôt get literally any of those notes. maybe a bit of the cranberry? i think my skin might just really amp the ‚Äòwoods‚Äô aspect, or maybe it‚Äôs a batch that‚Äôs heavy on that note??? it‚Äôs a shame because I really love mulled wine, and this is not at all how I imagined it would smell. it‚Äôs still enjoyable, although next time I‚Äôll have to revisit this with ‚Äòchristmas wreath‚Äô in mind

good projection, good sillage, good longevity

1/5 for expected smell, but it‚Äôs nice and I‚Äôll wear it in the winter, so 3.5/5





**Fri Oct 3 - Yemaya (BPAL)** üçà

In the bottle - floral! green and green fruit!

On skin - smells like a melon bowl (honeydew) surrounded by flower bouquets, with emphasis on the flowers‚Ä¶ so actually maybe a bouquet surrounded by melon balls? very fresh and bright and perfect for springtime. evokes images of colorful petals in the wind and picnic blankets on the grass

*Notes: melons and grapes, strewn with the petals of the flowers of motherhood, draped with sea mosses*

Dry down - for me, this scent was very flower-forward. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of florals, but overall this is pretty nice. I do wish the melon was the prominent note though (also wish I could smell the grapes at all)

good projection, ok sillage, ok longevity

3.5/5




**Sat Oct 4 - Macarons (Kyse)** ü•ê

In the bottle - generically sweet, twinge of alcohol, like almond or vanilla extract

On skin - oh woah, the almond really blooms. that sweet, cherried scent of marzipan is delightful. it‚Äôs almost nostalgic but I couldn‚Äôt tell you why. it‚Äôs honeyed and delicate and leaves you wanting more, just how macarons should be. although, it is *just* on the border of too sweet, almost cloying, but manages to stay beneath that line. I feel it might be a bit one-note, which is fine, but could use another layered scent,, lavender maybe? or something sharp and tart like strawberries

edit: I may have applied too much, it‚Äôs a liiiiitle bit strong. had to scrub some off, a little goes a long way

Dry down - much more enjoyable once I scrubbed a bit off. it‚Äôs very lovely and almost addicting, especially how it darkens on the tail end. it‚Äôs still a little too one-note for me to be in love though

*Notes: Heliotrope, marzipan, hint of cherry, caramelized sugar, velvety vanilla custard, and a soft smooth myrrh*

fantastic projection, fantastic sillage, fantastic longevity (I can STILL smell it on my clothes after 24+ hours)

4/5





**Sun Oct 5 - Rose Mallow Cream (Solstice)** üåπ

In the bottle - light, watery rose

On skin - rosewater :)

Dry down - it dries nicely, down to a delicate, creamy sweetness. the rose slowly fades away over the long duration

*Notes: Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk*

Post notes - all of the notes blend together well, so it‚Äôs hard to pick them out specifically. imo it‚Äôs a simple but effective fragrance

great projection, great sillage, great longevity

4/5

thanks for reading! I really appreciate all the enthusiasm and responses I‚Äôve gotten towards this little experiment <3 thank you for coming along on the beginning of my journey, and for anyone who partook in their own Scentember challenge, I hope you found some new favorite scents as well!

thanks again!! see you next time :D",14,1759712784.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False
1nz5k6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nz5k6c/id_only_been_overseas_on_business_for_two_weeks/,"I'd only been overseas on business for two weeks. When I got back, someone was in my home, painted to look like our cat, and my family couldn't tell the difference.","*‚ÄúHey! Get the* ***fuck*** *off my son!‚Äù* I barked, storming towards our couch, suitcase falling from my grasp somewhere along the way.

Juli planted a firm hand on my chest as I tried to pass her and asked what *my* problem was. 

She insisted that I must be exhausted from the flight, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight, but I could feel the subtext. 

The insinuation was as plain as day. 

She thought I was ass-over-tits drunk - or worse - right in front of our son, something I‚Äôd promised never to be guilty of again.

Heat gathered under my shirt collar. A flush crept up my face.

I was sober.

Stone-cold sober.

Dry as a goddamn ditch.

I mean, *she* was the one who‚Äôd allowed that *freak* into our home. *She* was the one who was letting them lounge on our kid‚Äôs lap like nothing was wrong.

How did I know *she* wasn‚Äôt on something?

Wordlessly, I ripped Juli‚Äôs hand away and rushed past her.

*‚ÄúDad?! Dad, what‚Äôs the matter? It‚Äôs just Rajah, Dad!‚Äù*

Tears began flooding. It hurt to make Ike upset, yes, but that hurt was nothing compared to the fear I felt, the raw, blistering confusion of it all. It was the gentle sparks of a firecracker versus the roiling fireball of a ballistic missile. 

No contest.

I loomed over the brown leather sectional. Ike slid out from under *them* and scampered over the top of the couch, sprinting into his mother‚Äôs trembling arms as soon as his feet hit the floor.

The person dressed to look like our house cat didn‚Äôt even react.

Knees to their chest, curled and comfortable, they placed a painted, five-fingered hand up to their mouth and rubbed their palm against their mask. I suppose they were simulating self-cleaning, but the mask didn‚Äôt have a hole for a tongue to come out of, so their skin just squeaked against the material.

My eyelids twitched. Icy sweat drenched my back. I looked to my wife for answers, but she just seemed terrified.

Terrified of *me*.

*‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶what is this...?‚Äù* I whispered, knuckles collapsing into a fist.

Ike whimpered. My wife raked his beach blonde hair, silent, wide-eyed.

***‚ÄúWho is this Juli?‚Äù*** The dry, crackling scream sent her dashing to the kitchen table, where her phone was resting.

Ike transitioned into full-on hysteria.

And, very much like a cat, the intruder appeared perfectly indifferent to our mounting duress. 

They stopped faux-licking their palm and stretched wide, shifting their stomach towards me, unafraid, unbothered, unprotected.

I stared at them, disbelief running dizzy laps around the base of my skull.

They were around five feet tall, mask included, which was circular, stout, flattened at the top, triple the size of a human skull, and circumferentially smooth. The shape reminded me of the box I used to store drum cymbals. 

Our calico‚Äôs likeness had been painted across the mask. Her light green eyes. The black splotch surrounding her nose. The ragged edges of her left ear. To fit the mask‚Äôs bizarre dimensions, however, all those familiar features were slightly distorted.

Everything was a little *too* wide and a little *too* big. 

It was the same with their gaunt, emaciated body. 

They‚Äôd faithfully and meticulously translated the markings of her fur onto their skin, stretching the pattern to fit over their lanky proportions. 

A patch of white over their sunken, craterous abdomen. 

Speckles of soft orange along their forearms, extremities which had cords of tendon revoltingly visible because of the way their thin skin wrapped tightly around their fatless frame.

Worst of all, they were naked.

No genitals, though. The crease was sleek and seamless, like a Ken doll.

My rage boiled over.

I descended, ready to cave their chest in with my bare hands.

*‚Äú****Marvin - Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs just a cat. Get a hold of yourself!‚Äù*** Juli blared.

My fist halted inches from their breastbone. 

They didn‚Äôt flinch.

I creaked upright so I could see my wife‚Äôs eyes.

*‚ÄúYou think this‚Ä¶you think they‚Äôre a cat? You think* ***this*** *is Rajah?‚Äù*

Ike was beyond hysterics at that point, shrieking, inconsolable, face pressed hard into her pant leg.

Juli didn‚Äôt answer. 

She pulled Ike away, into another room, urgently muttering to the 9-1-1 dispatcher.

*‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶he‚Äôs on something, or drunk, or sick - I don‚Äôt know. Just get someone over here.‚Äù*

My mouth felt dry. I ran a quivering hand through my sweat-caked hair, slicking it back. Wanted to look somewhat presentable when the police arrived.

All the while, *they* loafed on the couch.

Sleeping? Smiling? Laughing? Watching? Waiting?

I couldn‚Äôt tell.

The mask had no holes, and they never spoke.

I stood in front of the couch, lightly swaying, an empty swing shivering in a cold wind, observing patches of painted skin sinking between their brittle ribs as they exhaled.

How can they breathe? - I wondered, given that the plastic edges of the mask seemed to be continuous with their neck. I was no closer to an answer to that question when the police arrived a few minutes later.

I implored them to arrest the intruder, begging them to see reason, praying their view matched my own.

They looked at the *thing* on my couch and snickered, eyes gleaming with amusement.

I shouldn‚Äôt have expected them to take the request seriously.

How could I?

It was just a cat, after all.

\- - - - - 

The police graciously escorted me to the emergency room.

Not in cuffs, thankfully. Not that time.

All the tests were unremarkable.

The clear fluid they drew from my spine didn‚Äôt show signs of an infection agitating my nervous system.

The urine drug screen came back positive, but only for opioids, and the doctor expected that, given I was on naltrexone. The med helped dull any residual cravings for my old vices - alcohol and cocaine - but shared a chemical similarity to oxycodone.

My kidneys, my heart, my liver: every organ seemed to be in working order.

Far as the doctor could tell, there wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with me, and I hadn‚Äôt ingested anything they believed could inspire psychosis.

But when the psychiatrist asked, I remained insistent.

That *thing* wasn‚Äôt a cat.

From there, my trajectory was set.

Next stop: *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*

The first time wasn‚Äôt too bad. My fellow captives were tolerable, and the docs were nice enough. Smart, too. They eventually had me believing I was suffering under an *‚Äúisolated delusion precipitated by extreme stress‚Äù*. Their words, not mine.

Initially, I rejected the theory. 

The more I considered it, though, the more it seemed to click into place.

Undeniably, work had been taxing, and no one else saw Rajah as I did. Occam‚Äôs Razor suggested something was wrong with *me,* rather than everyone else. Not Ike, not Juli, and not the police.

Just me.

\- - - - - 

Five days later, I was discharged.

Ike was ecstatic, jumping up and down in the back seat of our sedan, wrapping a pair of little hands around my shoulders as I clicked the passenger seat safety belt into the holster. Juli was more reticent about my release, but she did a good job faking happiness for Ike‚Äôs sake.

I was the last to enter when we got home.

My feet felt thickly calcified to our stone stoop. It took Juli holding my hand to get me inside, practically yanking me over the threshold.

The door swung shut behind me. 

Electricity sizzled up the curves of my neck as I scanned my surroundings. Juli ran her thumb delicately across my palm. The massage was tender and affectionate, but I sensed a similar electricity hissing along her skin. She was nervous too, and in retrospect, she had every right to be.

I saw no masked intruder.

My static calmed. I turned to Juli and shot her a flimsy smile.

Then, there was a noise above us.

A quiet, inscrutable message.

A painful reminder.

*Knock.* 

*Knock.* 

*Knock.*

My body became a live-wire. Juli‚Äôs thumb dug vicious stigmata into my palm, having sensed my panic.

I glanced up, and there *they* were.

Lying prone on the balcony that overlooked our foyer, all but their mask wreathed in deep shadow, knocking the poor, oversized facsimile of Rajah‚Äôs skull against the bannister‚Äôs small wooden pillars, alternating left to right, right to left, left to right.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

The lead psychiatrist at *‚ÄúFalling Leaves‚Äù* informed me I went absolutely ballistic at the mere sight of our innocent house cat, and that my stay the second time around would be longer.

Much longer.

I don‚Äôt recall going ballistic, though. 

I have no memory of what transpired between seeing *them* again and the point at which I arrived at the psychiatric hospital.

All I remember is their terrible, pendulous sway, extending on into infinity. A video on a frozen computer screen, constantly refreshing but never righting itself, never moving on, perpetually misaligned and distorted.

A part of me never left that moment.

A part of me is still there, watching, helpless.

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

\- - - - - 

Juli still visited me over the following three months, but only weekly, and she wasn‚Äôt bringing Ike with her. Not only that, but judging by the way her cheekbones had begun progressively sharpening, she wasn‚Äôt eating. The stress of it all was getting to her, and that fact killed me.

At first, I pleaded.

Said things like:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not insane!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI know what I saw!‚Äù*

and

*‚ÄúFor the love of God, Juli, you and Ike aren‚Äôt safe!‚Äù*.

All she did in response was avert her gaze.

My pleas were falling on deaf ears, and the only thing those outbursts were earning me was a longer sentence at *Falling Leaves Behavioral Health Hospital*.

It was a tough pill to swallow, but I realized that feigning recovery from my *‚Äúdelusion‚Äù* was the most logical step forward. 

So, that‚Äôs what I did. 

Slowly but surely, I ‚Äú*recovered‚Äù*. Even endorsed during a group therapy session that I‚Äôd been covertly indulging in some designer, PCP-like drugs. Drugs that wouldn‚Äôt come up on a routine test, but certainly could send a mind through the proverbial garbage disposal. 

The psychiatrist seemed to buy it - hook, line and sinker.

One-hundred and eight grueling days later, my wife brought me home.

Her lips twitched as she drove. Her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. She‚Äôd lost a significant amount of weight - twenty pounds, maybe more.

*They* were right inside the door when I opened it.

Preening on their back beside our welcome mat, body contorted into a lazy stretch, silently beseeching a stomach scratch.

I watched her anxiety flourish into outright panic, knees fluttering, breathing sharp and shallow. Her eyes flashed to me, then to what she saw as our defenseless cat, and back again, petrified about what I might do.

Before she could pull her phone from her bag, I was bending down, rubbing my fingers against *their* belly. Its skin was doughy but disturbingly coarse, like partially congealed flour with grains of asphalt mixed into the batter.

As I suppressed a gag, I felt the silky touch of Juli‚Äôs hand on my shoulder.

*‚ÄúSo good to have you back, Marvin,‚Äù* she whispered.

I nodded, still rubbing; the dead eyes of their painted mask pointed at me.

Juli walked away. As soon as she was out of earshot, I stood up and retracted my hand, which was now coated in a fine, gray, odorless dust. 

Something was different about *them*.

Their abdomen seemed fuller than before.

\- - - - - 

The solution to this mess, as I imagined it, appeared relatively straightforward.

I didn‚Äôt need to understand *them*.

I didn‚Äôt need to know what they were, why only I could appreciate their true form, and what their purpose in my home was.

I just needed to kill *them*.

Thus, I needed my family incapacitated, unable to intervene.

So I dosed them.

One milligram of Lorazepam for Ike, four milligrams of Lorazepam for Juli.

For the record, benzodiazepines were never my vice. I mean, who wants to sleep through their high? Never made much sense to me. Still, I had use for them outside of hedonism as a sort of biochemical kill-switch.

Having the shakes from alcohol withdrawal? Take a Lorazepam.

Coke got you a little too revved up? Take a Lorazepam.

Thankfully, I was able to locate a dusty pill bottle stashed under a floorboard in the attic: a relic from my days as a fiend.

It wasn‚Äôt as dramatic as something like chloroform. They both just became incredibly drowsy after downing some spiked lemonade, neither very interested in having leftovers prior to turning in for the evening. I helped them up the stairs, and that was that. Both were out like a light in no time.

Ike told me he loved me.

Juli reminded me to feed Rajah. Three times.

She might have her suspicions in the morning, and I figured she‚Äôd be distraught to find *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* missing, but I‚Äôd cross that bridge when I came to it. 

As I drew Ike‚Äôs bedroom door closed, there *they* were.

Lying on their belly in the hallway, absentmindedly flicking water around their bowl with their seemingly nailless, human fingers.

That moment was the first pleasurable one I‚Äôd experienced since the whole damn ordeal began.

They were making it easy for me.

I tiptoed across the carpet, gaze ripe with beautiful violence, and when I was close enough, I knelt down and straddled the intruder. 

They writhed, attempting to get out from under me.

It was no use.

Only then did I experience a brief, smoldering curiosity about what was hidden beneath.

I clasped my hands at the point where its mask and neck became indistinguishable, and began wrenching it upwards. A deluge of endorphins set my blood on fire. My entire body radiated blissful warmth.

This fever dream was finally going to be over.

When the mask started to give, as threads of anchoring sinew started to snap, that‚Äôs when I heard their howls.

Both Juli and Ike, wailing in discordant unity.

Paternal instinct got me upright.

Before my conscious mind could even register the circumstances, I was kneeling beside my son.

He was sitting straight up, shoulders tensed to hell and back, eyes rolled into his skull, and, God, there was blood. Tiny crimson dewdrops formed a ring around his neck, *exactly* where I‚Äôd been tearing at the mask.

His screams grew fainter.

After a few seconds, he fell back limply onto his pillow, almost as if he‚Äôd passed out from within a dream. Only then did the wails completely die out.

Then, the house was utterly silent. Juli had stopped too.

Whatever I did *them,* it seemed to translate to my family. They were connected. Tethered.

I turned around, nearly toppling back onto Ike from the shock of what I saw.

*They* were there. In the doorway.

Standing on two feet.

Rajah‚Äôs stretched, vacant face stared daggers into me.

Gradually, it got back on all fours, pawed past me, climbed onto Ike‚Äôs bed, and curled up at his feet.

And I just stood there, paralyzed.

The message was obvious. They didn‚Äôt need a voice for me to understand.

*‚ÄúCheckmate.‚Äù*

\- - - - - 

The next morning, as I stewed over a mug of lukewarm coffee at the kitchen table, Juli approached me holding her pillowcase.

*‚ÄúHey! Glad to see you up so early.‚Äù*

I nodded, keeping my eyes fixed on the black liquid.

*‚ÄúWhat do you make of these stains? Smells a hell of a lot like blood, and it wasn‚Äôt there before I went to bed. I thought I saw some dried blood on my neck, but I looked myself up and down in the mirror and it doesn‚Äôt seem like I have a scratch on me. I don‚Äôt know; it‚Äôs just weird.‚Äù*

She dropped the pillowcase onto the table and returned to her morning routine. A blotchy, maroon-colored oval marred the light blue fabric, no bigger than a quarter. Flecks of coagulation dislodged as I scraped my thumbnail over the stain, but as I put it to my nose and sniffed, I didn‚Äôt detect even a hint of that sickly sweet, iron-kissed scent.

*‚ÄúHmm. Yup, smells like blood to me. Strange,‚Äù* I replied, draping the pillowcase over the top of a nearby chair.

*‚ÄúRight?‚Äù* She paced out into the foyer and began calling for Ike.

After years of snorting cocaine, my sense of smell was effectively nonexistent. Rarely, I‚Äôd get a faint whiff of something, but it‚Äôd have to be exceptionally fragrant to wake up my fried nerves, and it was always fleeting.

Juli didn‚Äôt know that, though. I was used to lying about it, too embarrassed to reveal the lengths to which I‚Äôd ravaged my body at the altar of *feeling good*.

My eyes darted to the pantry. 

There was a muffled tapping coming from the inside. The clack of my wife‚Äôs heels echoed as she moved to open the door.

The intruder spilled out, mask thudding against the floor, cans of beans and boxes of spaghetti toppling over like bowling pins.

*‚ÄúRajah, you goof, there you are,‚Äù* Juli cooed.

They got on all fours and began shaking violently, airing out their hypothetical fur, causing a cloud of pale dust to collect around them. Once settled, they tilted their mask up to *‚Äúlook‚Äù* at my wife.

She stared back at them, silent, grinning. After a moment, she turned to me and said:

*‚ÄúWow! He is vocal today, good Lord.‚Äù*

At no point did I hear *anything* from *them*.

Juli paced out of the kitchen, chuckling to herself.

I glared at the intruder. They had everyone else fooled, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to pinpoint what made me so damn special.

Suddenly, I had an idea.

What if something in my blood was allowing me to see through the illusion? 

Could I be genetically immune? 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, walked up to *them*, and snapped a quick picture.

Then, I texted my brother.

*‚ÄúFree for dinner tonight? Ike would love to see his uncle.‚Äù*

Dan and I weren‚Äôt estranged, but we weren‚Äôt on great terms, either. He lived about an hour away and had his own shit to deal with. More than that, though, I‚Äôd said some things better left unsaid while still in the throes of substance abuse. He‚Äôd kept me at arm‚Äôs length ever since.

I towered over the indecipherable devil, the haunting melody of my spellbound wife and son laughing upstairs thumping against my eardrums.

My hand buzzed.

*‚ÄúSure. Good to hear from you. Cars out of commission - mind picking me up?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHappy to.‚Äù* I replied.

Then, with no context, I forwarded him the picture I‚Äôd just taken, and waited.

The dots of a pending reply appeared across my phone screen. My heart racketed around my ribcage.

My life teetered on what he saw.

*‚ÄúEww. What the fuck is that, Marv?‚Äù*

Relief washed over me.

*‚ÄúTell you more later. Be there at 5.‚Äù*

I peered down at *them* and smiled wide, baring my teeth.

\- - - - - 

Most of the trip home from Dan‚Äôs was silent. I was too nervous to hold a conversation, manically tapping on the steering wheel, thoughts spinning.

As we were pulling off the interstate, he broke that silence, but not in the way I was expecting.

*‚ÄúHey, you haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶taken anything, right? Still on the wagon, so to speak?‚Äù* he asked.

Automatically, I responded:

*‚ÄúWhat? No. God, I wish.‚Äù* Each small word came out swift and punctuated.

Even with just my peripheral vision, I could tell he was giving me *that* look. A pitying condescension that always felt like a splash of acid gnawing at my skin. The type of look that used to reliably throw me into a rage at a moment‚Äôs notice.

I swallowed and rolled my shoulders. Focused my attention on the heat from the setting sun cascading through the windshield, rather than the resentment sizzling in my veins.

*‚ÄúThings at home have been better,‚Äù* I sighed.

Talk about an understatement, but what else could I say? Where would I even start?

I lost my job?

I was in a psychiatric hospital for months?

There‚Äôs a demon eunuch dressed as my house cat, and only I can tell? 

No.

He‚Äôd think I‚Äôd gone off the deep end.

Once he saw it for himself, then I‚Äôd be able to spill my guts. Once he understood, then we could strategize. 

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as bad as you - ‚Äú*

He paused, sniffing the air. A bout of harsh, vigorous coughing took hold of him. His eyes became glassy and red.

I considered pulling over by our town‚Äôs welcome sign, but he waved for me to keep going as I flicked my turn signal on.

*‚ÄúSorry - ‚Äú* he sputtered. *‚ÄúAllergies really have been a bitch this year.‚Äù*

The fit abruptly dissipated. When I looked over, he didn't seem concerned, and his breathing was steady, so I just kept going.  

A minute later, we pulled into my driveway.

He asked one last question as we walked up to the stoop, the final glimmers of orange twilight fading away above our heads.

*‚ÄúOh! Almost forgot - what the hell was that picture you sent me? Shit was cursed. Nearly fell out of my chair when it popped up,‚Äù* he chuckled.

I pretended not to hear him and opened the front door.

\- - - - - 

Hours passed before dinner was ready. 

We chatted, gave Dan copious updates about Ike, and even had time to play a few games of backgammon while the roast cooked. He continued to cough, but the fits were smaller, more contained. Honestly, he didn't even seem to notice them. 

All the while, *‚ÄúRajah‚Äù* never showed their face. Dread crawled over my skin like termites through wood, but I kept my cool.

*They‚Äôd* come.

Around eight, the four of us sat down to eat. Lines of steam rose above the glistening pile of meat at the center of the table. Ike, wanting to come off as a proper gentleman, insisted on serving us, dropping asymmetric portions of beef, mashed potatoes, and baked asparagus across each of our plates.

*‚ÄúAlright! Dig in.‚Äù* Juli announced.

My son descended ravenously. Still on edge, I gingerly mixed the gravy into the potatoes, eyes darting between each of the three entrances to our kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed something peculiar about Juli.

She was holding her utensils upright - a fork in one hand, a knife in the other - but she wasn‚Äôt moving, eyes locked on me but glazed over.

*‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶everything OK?‚Äù*

The only part of her that budged was her lips.

*‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù* 

Stomach twisting into agonizing knots, I turned to Dan.

He was swiping at the meal, but every time, his fork missed. 

A little too high. A little too far left. 

Over and over and over again.

*‚ÄúJuli, this turkey is something else,‚Äù* he muttered.

Something was desperately wrong.

Abruptly, my wife released her grip, utensils clattering against the plate.

*‚ÄúWow, I am stuffed!‚Äù* she proclaimed.

Juli sprang from her chair.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers.‚Äù*

She balled her hand into a fist, brought it close to her face, and began knocking on her forehead.

The resulting sound had an unnaturally pervasive resonance, like hot water running through a loose copper pipe, metal expanding and colliding against a nearby wall. 

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

*Knock.*

A series of wild thuds emanated from the foyer; a bevy of hands and feet and knees crashing down the stairs.

The frenzied stampede of a starving animal.

As the masked intruder charged into the room, Juli walked over to his dinner bowl and dumped the entire meal into it, pieces haphazardly ricocheting onto the side of a cabinet and the surrounding floor.

Suddenly, I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen her eat *anything* substantial since I left for that trip months prior. A few slices of toast with her coffee in the morning, but nothing more.

Dan pivoted to face *them* as they entered.

I held my breath.

He swung to me.

His eyes were rolled back into his skull - white balls of tapioca adorned with a latticework of bright capillaries, tiny red worms wading through a thick ooze.

*‚ÄúI was wondering when the little guy would show up. I‚Äôve missed him!‚Äù*

My heart buckled. My mind fractured.

Identically, my brother sprung to his feet, grabbed his plate, and dumped it in front of *them*.

*‚ÄúMight as well give Rajah the leftovers! Pets have to be fed, and we don‚Äôt want Ike to be the one to feed them, right? No, of course not. We want the best for our prodigy. We want them to grow. We them want to thrive. Right? Right?‚Äù*

The intruder hastily gathered the tribute into their arms, gravy smearing an impromptu Rorschach test along their trunk, and then began galloping past the table. At some point, Ike had gotten up and was standing by the screen door, creaking it open so they could careen into the backyard without losing an ounce of momentum.

For months, this must have been the routine. 

Looking at Ike, I found myself at a crossroads.

I could just give up.

Allow my family to be eaten away from the inside out, until there was nothing left, until they‚Äôd been made hollow.

Hell, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard, and who knows?

Weak and empty, they might not even have the brain power to notice if indulged in a vice or two on the side. A family that would stick around no matter what I did to myself.

I wanted that at some point, right?

Or, I could give chase to that incomprehensible *thing*, that fucking parasite.

Even if it felt hopeless, completely and utterly insurmountable,

I could still try.

Blood thrumming, heart burning,

I shot up and followed *them* into the moonless night.

\- - - - - 

It‚Äôs currently 11 PM.

When I finally arrived home, Ike and Juli were sleeping soundly, and Dan was gone.

But I don‚Äôt know where he got to, since I drove him.

There are‚Ä¶holes in the forest. Burrows. Tunnels.

I watched the intruder dive into one, still holding the food.

When I put my ear to the hole, I heard something.

Mewing.

Multiple identical, high-pitched yowls, overlaid with each other. Sounded *exactly* like Rajah when we forgot to fill his bowl. Hungry begging, but in eerie triplicate.

I never considered what happened to the *real* him until that moment.

If that is truly our original house cat, deep in the hole.

That‚Äôs not all, though.

On the way back, I passed by Mr. Hooper. He lives two doors down from us.

He was walking what he *believed* was his husky.

The man looked like he‚Äôd dropped thirty pounds since I last saw him.

It‚Äôs not just happening to my family.

I think the whole town is infested.

\- - - - - 

Not sure what to do next.

Search for Dan? Return to the hole?

It‚Äôs unclear, but I‚Äôll figure it out.

I‚Äôm publishing this in case something happens to me.

Juli, if you‚Äôre reading this, 

I‚Äôm not crazy.

I love you.

Sometimes I do tease, so be warned. Big into RPGS and things like Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate and DnD.

Values: Loyalty, family, patience, equality, and playfulness. I date to marry and am monogamous. We can discuss boundaries early. I‚Äôm saving myself and want someone who‚Äôs waiting too. If you're someone who takes relationships seriously and laugh easily, we'll probably get along.

‚ÄúRadio check,‚Äù Marla said in his ear, bored, chewing.

‚ÄúClear,‚Äù he said, and pushed off, boots kissing the fa√ßade, rope humming. Window Nine waited halfway down: an empty boardroom, twelve chairs arranged like waiting teeth. The wall screen held a paused slide, Q3 LOSSES, letters pale as morgue tags.

He laid a stripe of suds with the squeegee. From inside, something wiped the same arc at the same time.

‚ÄúMarla?‚Äù he said, too low.

‚ÄúWind‚Äôs nothing. You‚Äôre fine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou owe me later, for this callout.‚Äù

He drew a quick circle in the foam. Fingers met his from the other side, pad to pad. Not a reflection. Heat came through. He flinched.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs still in there?‚Äù he called. His voice came back tiny, swallowed. No lights shifted. The fingers slid up, finding the run of his rope, the buckle, the snug waist of the harness. A Liam-shaped smudge stood from the polished table and tried a smile he hadn‚Äôt earned.

‚ÄúMarla, pull me up. Now.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy. Winch engaged.‚Äù

He rose an inch; rope tightened at his hip. Inside, the other Liam didn‚Äôt move. He only reached, languid, curious, for a latch that seemed like it wasn‚Äôt there.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no latch,‚Äù Liam whispered.

‚ÄúOn those frames? There is,‚Äù Marla said, voice drying. ‚ÄúThey open inward. Building spec. Liam‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Inside, the boardroom door eased, as if something leaned its weight to listen. Chairs scraped back like dogs coming to heel. The other Liam tapped the pane, gentle, the way you tap a fish tank to make the thing inside look at you. He shaped the words carefully: come in.

The winch coughed and stalled. Something had the rope below, a second, colder hand. The radio gave a sound like someone breathing through paper.

‚ÄúMarla, my line‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNot me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ Jesus. Do you see that?‚Äù

The glass breathed out. The pane softened under his palms, temperamental as skin. The suds thinned, sliding over knuckles not his.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he told the window, stupidly.

The other Liam set his forehead to the glass, aligning the scar over the eyebrow Liam got in Year Eleven. Up close, the smile was all gums. He mouthed it again, patient: come in.

The pane took his hands, warm as bathwater. He slipped at the wrists first, felt carpet dust in his teeth, tasted stale coffee and iron. In his ear, Marla was saying his name and not saying his name.

He understood, then, what the night shift is for. It isn‚Äôt about quiet. It‚Äôs about the building deciding who belongs. And tonight it had finally filled the vacancy with a Liam-shaped thing that could smile without stopping.",2,1759712546.0,shortscarystories,0,0.75,False
1nz5gzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nz5gzk/the_great_dishpute_of_2024/,The Great Dish-pute of 2024,"I was ready to highkey throw hands over a single, crusted-over saucepan. It had been sitting in the sink for three days, mocking me from its murky grave of forgotten pasta remnants. Living in 'The Hub,' our co-living space for young professionals, was usually chill. We had our communal dinners, our Friday night movie marathons, and a shared passion for oat milk lattes. But the dishes? That was our Achilles' heel, our collective undoing.

The passive-aggressive Post-it notes had escalated. First, it was just ""Please clean your dishes, fam."" Then, ""A gentle reminder that dish soap exists."" By day three of the saucepan, someone (definitely not me, though I considered it) had just drawn an angry, stick-figure ghost hovering over the sink, labeled ""The Ghost of Dishes Past."" I'm not gonna lie, I was lowkey losing it. There were five of us ‚Äì Chloe, the perpetually cheerful marketing guru; Ben, the quiet coder who communicated mostly through memes; Maya, the grad student who lived on coffee and deadlines; and Leo, the free-spirited artist who saw the sink as a ""natural still life."" And then there was me, Alex, the self-appointed (and increasingly stressed) 'House Mom' who just wanted a clean countertop.

The breaking point arrived after a particularly chaotic Tuesday. I‚Äôd come home from a brutal shift, craving comfort food, only to find the last clean bowl caked with what looked like Ben‚Äôs experimental (and failed) ramen. I honestly just stared at it, a single tear kinda just rolling down my face. I was dead, y'all. I couldn't do it anymore. Instead of unleashing a furious text in the group chat, I took a deep breath. I walked into the living room, where Chloe was scrolling TikTok and Ben was deep in a coding vortex.

""Okay, guys,"" I started, trying to sound calm, but my voice still cracked a bit. ""We need to talk about the dishes. Like, seriously talk. I'm honestly at my wit's end."" Chloe looked up, eyes wide. Ben slowly peeled away from his laptop. Even Maya emerged from her room, sensing the tension. I explained how it made me feel, the constant stress, the feeling of being the only one who cared. Chloe, ever the empath, immediately apologized. ""You're so right, Alex. We've been slacking, no cap. I didn't realize it was affecting you this much."" Ben, surprisingly, offered a solution: ""What if we just... did a chore wheel app? It sends reminders. I can build something simple this weekend if you want."" Maya chimed in, ""Or we could set a 'clean as you go' rule, and if something's left for more than 12 hours, the person gets to do an extra chore next week?"" Leo, who usually avoided these discussions, surprisingly nodded. ""I mean, I get it. My art supplies are everywhere too. Maybe we need a system.""

We spent the next hour hashing it out. Ben's app idea actually seemed legit. We agreed to a ""same-day clean"" policy for all cooking utensils and plates, and a weekly rotating ""kitchen deep clean"" duty. The first few days were a bit rough, but then Ben‚Äôs app started sending passive-aggressive (but effective) notifications. Chloe organized a ""cleaning playlist"" that made scrubbing feel less like a chore and more like a dance party. And honestly? It worked. The sink stayed relatively clear. The Post-it notes disappeared. We even started leaving each other little ""thank you"" notes on the fridge for doing extra. It felt good. We were still five distinct personalities, but we learned to communicate, to compromise, and to actually see each other. My initial frustration had morphed into a deeper appreciation for my housemates and the community we were building.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.
