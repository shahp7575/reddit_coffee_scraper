I'm looking to make friends in the Ann Arbor area. I'm 44 years old, male, retired Air Force. 

Interests: video games, board games, hiking, running, sports, reading. 

I'm happy to meet up at a coffee shop and chat.

1lggjmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lggjmm/difference_between_cheap_vs_slightly_expensive/,Difference between cheap vs slightly expensive single boiler espresso machines?,"     I have been using the Agarro imperial espresso machine since over one year and thinking about upgrading now. I hardly ever need the steamer as I'm not really into cappuccino, so a single boiler espresso machine is best suited for me. I started off with four contenders: 

1. Gaggia evo pro
2. Rancilio Silvia v6
3. Lelit Anna PID
4. Hibrew H10 plus

      Lelit has a non-standard portafilter size, which would make it hard to find tools and accessories especially in India. I am not sure about the build quality or reliability of Hibrew. Rancilio is a solid machine but the advantage of a larger boiler doesn't really affect me as I just make one coffee a day. 

    After having it narrowed down to Gaggia evo pro (plus PID mod), I am wondering how much of a difference would it make upgrading from Agaro to Gaggia considering both of them are in the single boiler category and the latter costs over five times more? I understand that build quality definitely be a big difference, but I'm looking for differences that would directly affect how my espresso tastes. 

     BAdditionally, I'm open to suggestions for any other espresso machines you guys think would be better suited for me within similar price bracket. Thanks in advance! ",1,1750457369.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

My name is Van and I’m an introverted 33-year-old guy, just looking to make some friends with likeminded folk. I have no desire for intimate relationships at this time, and it is not something I am looking for anytime soon, I believe. My focus is to build up
 social bonds that transcend time and space since that seems more like me. I’m primarily interested in making companionship outside of the United States, but I’m not opposed to hearing from fellow citizens as well.  

I suppose I should share some information about me (which actually might be too much lol). 

Career: I never really knew what I wanted to do as a career while going through my adolescent years. I was more focused on friendships and extracurricular activities, so naturally my grades suffered. I was surprised that I even graduated, to be honest. Heh,
 four years of high school and I managed to skate with a 2.7 GPA. Interestingly enough college, university, and graduate school flipped a switch. I dedicated six years of my life to studying so I could be in the position I am today which would be a mental health
 therapist. I enjoy what I do as a career and don’t regret this choice. I know my mother wanted me to be something else, but that’s okay. The world of nursing and occupational therapy just doesn’t seem all that fascinating to me, but I appreciate those who
 work in such careers. What do you do for a career? Do you love it? Do you regret it?  

Health: Medical: 

I don’t have any severe debilitating conditions, but I have had a fair number of surgeries and health conditions. I would need two hands to count them at this point and there is potential for another surgical procedure this year. I will let you know now so
 there are no surprises. I am a two-time cancer survivor. One for skin cancer and one for liposarcoma. I’m currently in the post-treatment phase of sarcoma. Unfortunately, I’m currently struggling with lymphedema, which is a side effect of radiation or chemotherapy.
 I’m hoping that a vein bypass will cure that. Physical therapy can only do so much after all.  

In terms of exercise my main goal is to walk 5500+ steps a day, which is something I recently have gotten quite serious about. I used to be able to weightlift regularly, but that no longer seems to be the case since a portion of the bicep was removed from my
 right arm. So, I have become reliant on my left. If you have any strong recommendations to keep my right arm strong, I would love to read them or hear about them.  

Mental health:  

So, this part is always fun to talk about because of what I do for my career. I have willingly gone through having my own therapist due to symptoms of depression which have been successfully treated because I get the lows every so often, but I know how to better
 cope with those whether that’s with isolation or socialization. There is no history of self-harm, suicide attempts, etc. I think the most notable thing here is that people assume I’m autistic, so I’ll make it clear now I have gone through a psychiatric evaluation,
 and it was determined that I’m not autistic. Though I could see how some of my own quirks would suggest such. There is no reportable trauma history. 

Do you have any medical or mental health stuff you want to share? 

Food and Drink:  

I do enjoy food. I like to eat, order out, go out, cook, and bake etc. I tend to lean towards cuisines that involve a variety of meats and spices. So, think Middle Eastern, Spanish, and Thai. Comfort foods are burritos, chicken sandwiches, soups, and kebabs!
 To keep my body healthy, I don’t consume soda or alcohol. I’ve cut out caffeinated coffee and will consume decaf coffee every so often. To treat myself, I’ll every so often get a cherry milkshake.  

Baked Goods: Cinnamon Rolls, Danishes, and Brownies!  

Tell me about your food and drink loves!  

Activities:  

So, I enjoy spending my free time exercising, exploring new museums, going out to live performances, reading, cooking, baking, going to garden parks, taking pictures of flowers, and planning trips to other states and countries. Some of my more peculiar interests
 are perhaps poisonous plants, taxidermy, human anatomy, morbid curiosities like the death around the world and the funeral industry within the United States. I don’t play video games as much as I used to but every so often, I’ll pick up a new JRPG or something
 out there like The Coffin of Andy and Leyley. I do enjoy watching movies and television, which includes anime and cartoons. When it comes to genres I enjoy horror, sci-fi, philosophical, A24 movies, and strange comedy. 

Marriage and Children:  

I have no desire to have children. I don’t have a strong desire to get married. This isn’t because of a lack of commitment but more so having full trust in a significant other. The same goes for friendships. I’m quick to end a relationship when my expectations
 are not met or I’m hurt to an unnecessary degree. I don’t mind making friends with people who have children or are married. 

Personality and Strengths, etc:  

Personality: INTJ and Aries.  

Strengths: Boundary Setting. Assertiveness. Hardworking. Kindness. Brutal honesty. Emotionally supportive. 

Weakness: Lack of empathy. Brutal honesty. Logic oriented. 

Culture:  

I was the product of Russian and Middle Eastern parents.  

I don’t practice religion. 

Gender and sexuality:  

Male and Demisexual.  

Family:  

I have a mother, grandmother, ½ brother, and sister-in-law. 

I love them dearly and they are quite important to me.

Elaine’s boyfriend acts like a stereotypical dad – telling dad jokes, giving fatherly advice to other kids in his apartment building, etc. – but doesn’t have any kids of his own.

1lgga5q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgga5q,Upgraded Worm Factory 360,"Good afternoon vermicomposters,

  
I wanted to proudly share this set up I have been working on and receive your praise, thoughts, and advice. I bought a Worm Factory 360 & 1000 red wigglers about 3 months ago, and quickly realized that a single bin would not be able to take care of all my organic waste (I live by myself and cook every day). 



The other 3 bins were collecting dust so I decided to split the population and stack on the second bin. However, I was somewhat concerned about the airflow that the bottom bin would get (and the top one, through the bottom holes). I decided to screw these wooden pieces at the bottom to have each bin basically prop up at the edge of the bin below, and thus let air to both bottom and upper bins.

  
About 2 weeks ago I decided to modify (augment with wooden legs) the two remaining bins, purchased another 100 worms, and put them in action. I was using damp cardboard with holes to cover each bin to contain moisture and prevent flies but I found I was being too successful in the former, and failing at the latter. So I decided to try doing away with the covers to let moisture levels go down, and instead fence off the gaps with a mesh to prevent flies.

  
Its been about a week and so far I call this a total success. No flies, no bad odors whatsoever, and I am able to feed each bin once every 5 days (cut up vegetable scraps w. coffee grounds, frozen and thawed + shredded carboard). Worms seem to be thriving happy (none leaving the bins) and when I check on each bin roughly once a week they seem to be happily munching on the last feeding. 

  
Please, share your thoughts. Especially, if you are seasoned and have been humbled and wisened by the worms, I would appreciate any advice you might have or things to watch out for.",2,1750456685.0,Vermiculture,0,1.0,False

Any words of encouragment?,"I connected with a guy on an app. I'm in LA and he's in NY. He has been really warm and attentive towards me but his profile did say, ""here for friends"" - one of two settings you can choose. A lot of guys use this as passive dating since it's also a community app, but I took that at face value. I do know he's single.

Over the week and a lot of good chats where we learned we have incredible amounts of similar interests, I learned that he was pretty special and I should be more open to a real connection—friend or other. I knew I'd be in NY over the summer so eventually I arrive and let him know. He's super encouraging and excited. I realize of course we are far away so the most that can really happen is a quick fling sort of thing or really it will be just friends but a cool connection to have.

However, once the day comes, I'm suddenly SO SO nervous in a way I have never felt before. It's a daytime date getting coffee and those always make me anxious but I felt I need to grow and just do it. So I go and he's a bit naturally awkward \[a sensitive, artsy music guy in a famous supergroup (not saying to be annoying just to say, it added some anxiety for sure as I have been deep in the music scene since a teen)\].

I felt I could not say anything without overthinking or underthinking it. I was meandering and maybe far too chatty. Just not my normal cool, collective and witty self who can charm a tree. We chatted at the coffee shop for an hour and then he asked if I wanted to walk to the bookstore with him to get a book he ordered. Walking and talking was better and I was more relaxed but I still didn't ask him any normal questions or present the best version of me.

We lingered at the bookstore longer and talked about our favorite bands. He said he would send me a song. When it was time to part ways, I was the one to suggest it as it did feel like time, and then the goodbye which I thought would be a simple hug and nice to meet you got kinda awkward too. His body language was confusing and so broke the ice and said, ""I'm calling a car. It was nice to meet you and gave him a hug."" But it didn't feel very comfortable. I was surprised by that too.

I expected not to hear from him again and to just be online friends moving forward. He texted me near midnight and said, ""Nice to meet you! Here's the band. I love them."" sent me the link.

In the morning I wrote back that, ""Nice to meet you too! I read a review of them before but never listened. I listened to the album this morning and they're lovely. Also a cute group."" Even that was FAR wordier than normal me. He never responded which I guess is fine. But man I feel so WEIRD and bummed at the same time. I know for a fact normal chill me would have really impressed him.

Anyway, I have NEVER bombed a meeting before and I just feel so weird. Any words of encouragement?

This is my first time posting an update, and I thought it was a good time to share my progress, recent wins, and my current process for getting input.

[Monthly input and total \(current month estimate assuming 2 hours\/day for remaining\)](https://preview.redd.it/b39110g1k58f1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca9d66a2d05a377d37640608f8ed22bc4e03f26)

**History**

I started using Duolingo in the Fall of 2023, after we began planning a trip to Costa Rica for the Summer of 2024. I also experimented with Anki, LingQ, ConjuGato, and listened to most of Language Transfer.

In January 2024, I started to realize that I was never going to be able to speak fluently following this path, and I discovered Dreaming Spanish. In the beginning, I kept doing Duolingo, flashcards, etc but quickly decided to drop all of that and focus only on input.

I went to Costa Rica with \~100 hours. We had a great time, and although I didn't have a lot of opportunities to hear or even try speaking Spanish, I do think I had a better experience with the previous input. We were in very touristy resorts/tours where everyone spoke English. The most Spanish listening and speaking attempts we had were with bus drivers, because on average they spoke the least English, and we were with them for hours at a time.

To address the gap in Fall last year: I was still planning on continuing with learning Spanish, but I think I was burned out a bit from cramming before the trip and still ""only"" having 100 hours when the time came. Eventually I returned to my previous input level in November, mostly motivated from reading all of your stories/updates here.

**iOS Beta App**

By far the largest increase in my hours was when Pablo and the team released the iOS app beta in December. I had the web app installed to my home screen and it was *fine*, but I really had to keep an eye on it so make sure it would play the next video, change my screen settings to never turn off/go to sleep, etc. The native app enabled me to get 4+ hours a day over Winter break while doing some house projects, and it also works much better when I'm listening in the car. I cannot overstate how much friction this removed for me. I'm excited for Android users to get the same opportunity.

**Crosstalk**

I began booking time with teachers on italki in February, and have really enjoyed it. The amount of overall listening time is less, but you're required to pay attention in a conversation, especially when asked a question. Small changes in tense or conjugation can change the meaning and my answer. The biggest benefit for me is that it motivates me the rest of the day/week to build hours towards starting to speak, and I'm building relationships with teachers ahead of that. I'd recommend even just getting one 30-min crosstalk session a week for everyone if you can afford it.

I always message teachers before booking a trial class explaining that I don't want to speak yet, I would like to crosstalk, etc. Most have been okay with it, only a few have had other students doing the same, and I've gotten some flat-out rejections suggesting that it won't work and I should speak from the start.

I currently have 3 teachers in Mexico and 1 in Costa Rica, and some others that I'm not active with but would like to return to once I start speaking.

I tried using HelloTalk for a bit, but that was mostly a waste of time. I would spend hours to find someone to chat with for \~15 minutes, and received so many weird messages.

**Daily Routine**

I get most of my input from podcasts at the moment, some from DS, and a little from YouTube. The biggest hurdle for me was finding a way to easily count input outside of DS. It was too tedious to watch/listen to something 10-15min long and then remember to log it in DS.

For podcasts I am using Pocket Casts, and I only subscribe to Spanish podcasts there (I use Apple Podcasts for English). The important part is that It has a listening history screen, but it's really only useful if you finish an episode (otherwise it shows time left and I need to do more math).

I have a separate YouTube account that I use only watch videos in Spanish. In the YouTube app for iOS, it will show total watched minutes for today, for any platform (including web/TV), whether you finished the video or not. I believe it also counts Shorts. I would like to find a podcast app that has this same ability to just total all listening time.

My day typically looks like:

* Listen to at least 1 episode of each of these (starting from oldest), mostly while getting ready in the morning, chores, driving:
   * Andrea La Mexicana (currently finished all of these)
   * Advanced Spanish Podcast from WorldsAcross
   * No Hay Tos
   * Cheleando con Mextalki
   * Some other podcasts that I find interesting/or to try
* Most weekdays I have an italki class in the morning, and I record this in DS immediately after it finishes (per Pablo, I record the entire class time)
* Watch DS or YouTube if I have time throughout the day
   * If I want to learn something on YouTube (a piece of software, things related to coffee, etc), I've been able to find Spanish-language creators that are comprehensible for me, and enjoy combining my input time with whatever else I'm working on
* After dinner/chores/before bedtime, log daily time outside time in DS
   * Open Pocket Casts and add up all of the episode times from the history screen
   * Copy minutes from YouTube
* Listen only to DS after this point, as it automatically tracks my time without having to think about it

**Headphones**

I upgraded to AirPods 4 with ANC last Fall, and I love them so much. It's so easy to pop them in and resume podcasts or DS. The ""adaptive"" level of noise cancellation is perfect for most situations. There is a conversation detection mode which turns off noise cancellation and lowers your media volume, which is great in theory but I wish it paused content too, hopefully they add that option at some point so I can seamlessly go from talking to people and back to getting more input.

**Dubbed Movies**

I've started watching kids movies dubbed in Spanish. If we watch a movie as a family, I will put on noise-cancelling headphones and sync Disney+/etc on my phone to the TV. Although I'm targeting Mexican Spanish, the Spain Spanish has been more comprehensible for most of the movies we've watched, but I've forced myself to use the Mexican/Latin American track for the last few.

There's also an app called TheaterEars which works at most movie theaters and will sync your headphones to the movie, and yes I walk into the theater carrying over-the-ear headphones. This week we went to see How To Train Your Dragon.

I sometimes have difficulty comprehending the songs, and will record \~½ the time in DS if there are a lot of them in a musical. I will look at subtitles for songs if we're at home (it's surprisingly difficult getting the correct Spanish track and subtitles to match), and this is the only time I've use subtitles.

**Intermediate Plateau**

In the 300-500 hour range, I felt like my comprehension was not getting any better and it was a struggle to stay motivated, but reading other people's experience here, it seemed expected. I felt like I was so close to 600 hours and should be farther along, but then I realized there's still a long way to go. For example, 450 seems close to 600, but 150 hours is a lot more input!

All of a sudden around \~475-500 hours, a ton of content opened up on YouTube and podcasts. Native content from YouTubers or talkshows about soccer are now easily understandable. There is still a ton of content that I try once and decide is still too difficult, but it's really encouraging that it happened that way, and that all of my hours of input were building towards it.

I think I also had my first dream in Spanish? This week, I woke up and was thinking/saying >!tienes que ir!< to someone in my dream. I don't remember anything else about the dream, but that was pretty cool.

I've also been reflecting on how much I understand from DS/podcasts/YouTube, and that all of the grammar I've picked over the past few hundred hours has been solely from input. It's really difficult to see progress daily or even weekly, but compared to a few months/hundreds of input hours ago, there's obviously a huge amount of vocabulary that I've learned just from listening.

**Reading**

I don't read books in English that often, and when I do, it's mostly to learn a skill/non-fiction. The most recent book I read in English was [The Coach's Guide to Teaching](https://www.coachsguidetoteaching.com) and that was \~9mo ago. Before that, it was probably a book related to software engineering. I have not been able to find books like these in Spanish when I'm interested in a topic.

Most of my English reading day-to-day is my phone, email, and Reddit. I set my phone to Spanish once around 250 hours and changed it back after a few days. I set it again \~400 hours and have kept it since. Aside from having your interface/apps in Spanish, it's also been helpful when I Google things, the results are in Spanish or I end up on a Spanish Wikipedia page. I'm not able to count words this way, but overall I feel like not reading more is holding back my grammar the most, and am trying to do as much as possible. I've been adding some subreddits in Spanish, such as r/futbol in addition to r/soccer, and plan on looking for more this week.

I've also been trying to incorporate more news sources into my daily phone routine, such as El Pais or Marca, but I haven't been consistent with that yet.

**Speaking Plan**

Similar to above, for a while I felt like there was no way I would feel comfortable speaking at 600 hours, and that I would have to wait until 1000 at a minimum. But recently, I've started having longer phrases pop into my head, and I find myself ""thinking"" in Spanish occasionally.

I've also tried saying a few words here or there, usually in an italki class when I'm responding to something and think of a word and am excited to share. When it comes out of my mouth, it sounds nothing like what it does in my head, and that makes me think I'm capable of recognizing mistakes. It may be that I just need to practice with a teacher and build the muscle memory? I still have \~70 hours to go before 600, so I'm sure I'll be even more ready when the time comes.

My plan at the moment is to continue italki classes with all of my teachers (\~2-3h/week), and switch from crosstalk to speaking when I hit 600 hours. I'm going to record a speaking sample in English before I do that, and then record some of my first class speaking, and maybe every 5 or 10 hours after.

**Summary and Future**

Thanks if you've read this far. I think the biggest point I wanted to share was how important process and tools are to me, both the native app beta and figuring out a system for counting input outside of DS has allowed me to double/triple my daily minutes (along with having enough hours to listen to intermediate audio-only content). Process is also going to be important for me to achieve a routine for reading.

We recently went to Puerto Rico, and again I didn't have a ton of opportunities to listen to Spanish, but native speakers really do light up when they realize that you understand.

I'm planning to get to 1,000 hours by the end of the year, and 1,500 by next Summer. We haven't planned trips for next year yet, but will definitely be visiting 1-2 places in Latin America or Spain.

Thanks!

He is one of our fully remote workers being that he is higher up and from across the country. We work very closely as he is the owner of most of my accounts, and I always thought he was one of the more attractive men at the company but never thought much about it. he's also almost 25 years older than me. Well we met and idk if it's the fact that i'm ovulating or was basically with him at a conference then a company dinner but i feel like it was super obvious i was attracted to him. i have a partner but we are currently broken up but still living together trying to work things out and i was feeling extra wild that day. whenever my boss's boss spoke to me i could barley hold eye contact and also could barely remember to speak. but i am naturally very shy and always struggle to talk to attractive people. i have 0 desire to have a relationship with this man and even if i was single i would not hook up with him.

however we all are required to have our cell phone numbers and our signatures in case of emergencies, but even my own boss and my main coworker Has never texted me. After the conference, he started texting me and said it was nice to meet me, but he's been texting me ever since. Just random things about like events he's going to sports what he's getting for dinner tonight. it's kind of weird. I think he might just be lonely, but I also hope that I didn't give him the wrong impression. I feel super embarrassed now, but as I said, I've always been really really bad at hiding my attraction to people. He even said that we should meet up before the next conference and strategize more over coffee and I made sure the emphasize that I agree and think we should ALL meet up. 

I don't really wanna text him anymore, but him being my boss's boss and basically one of the partners at the company makes me hesitant to just ignore him",2,1750456619.0,work,1,0.75,False

I smelled it as soon as I entered the house, but for some reason, it didn’t register. I wish it had. As if it were a normal Friday afternoon, I headed to the kitchen, unloaded my groceries. Wine in the fridge, bagels in the breadbox, ice cream in the freezer. All the essentials.

From there, I carried my shoulder bag into the living room and dumped it and the mail on the couch without so much as pausing to see if it stayed put or fell on the floor. Walked on to my bedroom so I could change. My work wardrobe is as casual as can be, especially on Fridays, but still. Jeans are a prison. I shucked them off, exchanged them for sweat shorts. Threw my hair in a pony. The tee could stay.

Feeling lighter, I went back to the living room, flopped onto the couch. Tossed the mail over to the coffee table without looking at it, then opened my bookbag. Grabbed the first essay and stared at the sentence: ‘The green light is a metaphor for envy because Tom is jelly.’ I closed my eyes. Bane. Of. My. Existence. I sighed and put my feet up, grabbed a red pen. Last week, a kid told me red ink gave him nightmares. I gave him a purple sticker shaped like a ghost. He complained to mommy anyway.

I sniffed and glanced at the stack of mail, saw a corner of the official seal. With my toe I scooched the envelopes to the other end of the table. ‘Inocense’? Yikes. In this day and age, how were kids still misspelling things? Red mark. My butt had gone to sleep. I shifted on the couch, tried to wake it up. Didn’t work, so I got up and went to the kitchen, poured a glass of wine.

“Alexa, turn on living room.” The sun had gone down and I hadn’t even noticed, I’d been so engrossed in these, uh, eloquent essays. Green light. White dress. Green light. White dress. Yes, I got it. They paid attention in class. But couldn’t they, just once, dive a little deeper? Think for themselves? Find anything else in the text on their own? A yellow dress, maybe? The weather? Think outside the box, kiddos.

*Achoo!*

There it was again. I rubbed my nose. Soon I’d need a Benadryl. I tossed the papers to the side and grabbed the remote. Flipped around from one app to another before settling on something.

My head snapped up. Shit. I’d fallen asleep and missed half the episode. I snapped the television off and stretched. Time for bed. My stomach growled. A reminder I’d forgotten to eat. I’d do it tomorrow.

*Sssssssstttt*

Before I could stand, I heard a rustling sound. A hand appeared at the other end of the couch. Jagged, painted nails. I jumped up, tripped over the coffee table, stumbled but kept my feet. The other hand joined the first, holding a knife. A grunt and then the woman who belonged to those jagged nails stood.

“Miss me?”

Shit.

She danced around the couch, her arm slicing the air. Wild. *Whoosh.* Keeping an eye on her, I walked backwards as fast as possible, reaching for the kitchen counter where the knife block stood. Why hadn’t I grabbed one the moment I smelled her perfume? My nose had tried to tell me. Chocolate. Roses. Praline. Angel by Thierry Mugler. Once it had been my favorite, too. She’d ruined it for me.

And now she was about to kill me.

My fingers scrambled. Keys. A bottle of ibuprofen. *Thunk.* A water glass, now empty. Where was the--? There. I slid a knife out of the block, but clumsily. It snagged on the wood the whole way. All of this took place in seconds, but felt like minutes. Hours. She was almost on me by the time I freed the…? Crap. Steak knife? Were you kidding me?

She glanced at the weapon in my hand and giggled, sounding like a schoolgirl, which she decidedly was not. “Really?” Before I knew what happened, she’d shot forward and sliced my forearm, but only just, then jumped back again. Smarted, though. Blood started to trickle. Like a child, I jabbed at her with my steak knife. Yeah, I know. But I did. She stayed back, though. Probably not because of my knife. Probably just to prolong this bullshit.

“When did you get out?” And why hadn’t anyone--? Oh, the mail. The seal.

She read my face. “Still only checking your mail once a week?”

I half shrugged. What was the point? Junk mail, Safeway ads… Oh, and I guess notices from the prison alerting you to the fact your ex was out. I glanced at the kitchen island to my left and saw something that made me believe in something above (before this, I’d had my doubts. Agnostic? Atheist? Potato, patotoh.). The iron. I should preface this by saying I hate ironing. Hate it. Never do it. Like, never. To the point I’d literally forgotten I owned an iron. I don’t own an ironing board, so earlier in the week when I’d been reminded (hounded) by our principal that there was a parent-teacher night coming up, I freaked out and ransacked my closet looking for something, anything, appropriate to wear. My funny t-shirts were out, my slouchy tops, out…ah! I found a nice long sleeve button down shirt, but it was wrinkled as hell. I called my mother, she said to put it in the dryer with a wet washcloth. Tried. Epic fail. As I stood in the laundry room, I noticed…yep, you guessed it, an iron. Right there on the shelf, in my eyeline, I’d looked at it a million times but never noticed it, you know?

So grabbed the iron, cleaned off the kitchen island and ironed my shirt. And promptly left the iron there, didn’t put it away. Score! Now I reached over, grabbed it, and plonked Meg in the face with it. Just wish it had been on.

“Fuck you,” she hissed. I

I kept the island between us, but made sure to grab a real knife while she was otherwise occupied. Now I held my weapon at the ready. How did we get here? Our wedding flashed through my mind. Could still feel the warm sand between my toes, the sun on my face. So bohemian. The more worrying thought, though, was how did *she* get here? Hadn’t I changed the locks?

“Miss me?” She stepped to the right. I stepped to the left.

“No. And I smelled you a mile away.” I drew the knife up, narrowed my eyes. Looked for a target. Shifted my stance. “If you want to sneak up on someone, maybe skip the perfume.”

“Aw, Jo.” She leaned over the island. “You know you love it.”

I gagged. Her breath hit like garbage in the hot sun. No wonder she’d bathed in perfume. I backed away. She might have been out, but she hadn’t taken the time for any general hygiene. Her head juked forward, I flinched. She laughed. “Come on, we’re just having fun. Aren’t you happy to see me?”

“No chance we can settle this amicably?”

She let out a surprised laugh. At least I could still surprise my wife, ex-wife, after all these years. “No.”

We danced around the island some more. Call me a wuss, but when knives are involved, I prefer distance. Always a graceful partner, she danced along with me. Meg stepped around the end. I stepped around the other. She shook her head, disappointed. “Chicken.”

“Well, yeah.”

Then she did something I didn’t see coming. She sprawled across the island like a friggin’ spider monkey and jabbed the knife into side. “Fuck!” I fell against the frigde; the blood flowed.

Meg laughed. Laughed! “Learned that in my self-defense classes. Amazing what they teach you in there.”

I’m a lover, not a fighter, so I ran back to the living room to grab my cell phone. Why had I left it? She followed. I turned around and jammed the knife into her stomach. I mean, did she not notice I hadn’t dropped my weapon? It’s like I tell my students, I’ve provided you with the information, if you don’t pay attention, the result isn’t my problem.

Meg ‘oofed’ like I’d let her air out. She clutched her stomach and stumbled. Her tailbone cracked against the coffee table and she somersaulted backwards off of it, landing hard on the floor.

Her blood soaked my students’ essays. “Sorry kids,” I mumbled, thinking about the light at the end of Daisy’s dock as I watched the light go out of Meg’s eyes. Not quite the same symbolism, but I can tell you, the woman was out of my reach. Then I called 911. I had a lot of explaining to do, but so did the authorities. They’re supposed to call *and* send a letter. Who checks the mail these days?

1lgg7n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MigratorModel/comments/1lgg7n3/an_eti_redline_flashpoint_ai_weaponry_update_2025/,An ETI Redline Flashpoint - AI Weaponry ? (Update 2025 June 20),"What follows is speculation (upon speculation) - a brief exploration of what we might expect to see from an established older ETI civilisation not far away (in galactic terms). There's no doubt about it, we are a highly aggressive and arguably dysfunctional species prepared to countenance mutually assured destruction if a rival state is not playing ball. What would be the one technological development that might solicit a response from a far older species keeping an eye on us from afar? I asked this question of a stranger I met today and his answer was my own conclusion: ""AI into weaponry.""

Don't get me wrong before exploring this deeper. I have no illusions that we as a species will put aside our national divisions, stop warring and live in peace and harmony. We are a territorial species and that's not going to change - however the counter to that is there must be some middle ground where we reign in the tendency for war, and put (at least) as much of our AI technology into improving economic and infrastructural progress. If we are a lopsided species pouring all our AI into weaponry, for an established and stable civilisation we would be like a crazed drunken teenager with deadly weapons - for a neighbour!

Oumuamua's timing - as we make our first steps into space, but more importantly as our computer technology is accelerating apace. If I have decoded a signal, and decoded it aright - this ETI will be back in 2027, either with a similar vessel or (I suspect) something a lot larger. As noted, for this all to work, given the 1470 light years distance of Tabby's star - the signal was set up around 550 AD and to know we are metal workers our planet would have had to have been scanned around 950 BC. Pyramids up already over two millennia, more importantly bronze age transitioning into iron age. Nearly 1500 years later Tabby's star receives the signal and configures some of its asteroid processing platforms on our line of sight - we detect the anomalous dips today. A mother ship or two, stationed outside but near our Solar System, and knowing the timetable of dips (which probably repeat in cycles) launches Oumuamua to coincide (at perigee, perihelion) with the Angkor dip. This ETI could be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us, but we could still be a danger given at certain thresholds technological advancement probably peaks and slows (akin to data mining). Given our short lifespans, it's hard for us get our head around a signal requiring (ar least) 3000 years of strategic planning - but for a species that's been around millions upon millions of years - this could be a coffee break.

So they would be flagging seniority - 'listen up we're not playing around - how you behave in space determines whether we tolerate you as a neighbour; it is easy to deal with a problem while small.'",1,1750456488.0,MigratorModel,0,1.0,False

1lgg5su,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1lgg5su/frequent_urination_with_subclinical_hypothyroidism/,Frequent urination with subclinical hypothyroidism,"Hello!  
i have graves disease, i reached normal levels in april 22th i had tsh of 2.60 and t3 and t4 in normal, mid range.  
Two months later my (today) TSH has reached 8.4 while t4 at 1.16 and t3 is 3.70 that's considered subclinical hypo.

Lately i think i have been urinating more frequently, the temps in my country dropped a bit due weather, rains and such, hurricanes etc (Mexico) so i read that some people go to bathroom more frequently when gets colder.

Also i feel colder myself, i was used to be a living furnace with graves disease and hyperthyroidism, now with TSH at 8 and controlled T4 my body is not that hot anymore, my blood pressure is totally ok below 120/80 and resting heart rate in average 62-70.

I think i peed like 67oz in the past 18 hours, that's like 2 liters and lately i wake up at least twice to pee. Sometimes i need to pee at leas once every one hour and a half, i don't know if that's too much or normal. Finally i drink some coffee during the day and afternoon.

As usual if you google symptoms you get catastrophic results like ""that can be a sign of heart failure"" or ""kidney disease, kidney failure symptoms"" so you obviously start freaking out because google says: *""heart failure can also cause shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, fatigue, and weight gain.""*

I don't have swelling in the legs or ankles at all but i do have all the other symptoms like weight gain, fatigue, more urination and shortness of breath every now and then.

now remove heart failure and add subclininal hypothyroidism or just hypothyroidism +  *frequent urination, shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight gain.*

and you get this result: *Subclinical hypothyroidism can cause symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs and ankles, although these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions.*

Or *Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, can indeed cause frequent urination, shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight gain*.

I love how the body have some specific symptoms that can be caused by multiple conditions, that's why self diagnosing and using google is a terrible idea but i never learn and always google my symptoms.

Considering that i have graves disease and have been taking methimazole for 6 months already and my TSH has been at 7-8 probably for few weeks already, temps dropped and i feel colder etc i think i can discard my symptoms being heart related or kidney related, and also i take coffee and have vitamin d insufficiency.

yes i also i have Vitamin D Insufficiency, my levels are in the ""insufficiency"" range at 22 ng/ml (which can cause lightheaded feeling, fatigue, shortness of breath etc) and once again and if you google this you get the next result:  
*Vitamin D insufficiency can be associated with frequent urination, specifically overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. Studies have shown a link between low vitamin D levels and these conditions, with some evidence suggesting that supplementation may help alleviate symptoms.*

anyways thx for the replies just want some reassurance and understand whats going on.",1,1750456351.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

1lgg3ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattooadvice/comments/1lgg3ll/cover_tattoo_at_work_after_10_days/,Cover tattoo at work after 10 days?,"Hey everyone. I got some great advice last time I posted here and I have another question as someone new to tattoos. I got 2 tattoos 9 days ago and tomorrow I am going to be working at a farmer’s market as a barista. It gets super hot there for several hours but I am not in the sun. There are dirty things I work by such as powders, coffee grounds, espresso, milks, etc. that could get on me/my tattoo. So, I am wondering if I should cover my tattoo(s) with clothes for the shift to keep it clean, but then risk getting more sweaty/uncomfortable, or if you think it would be fine to wear a tank top, keep it moisturized, and wash it when I am done? My biggest concern is an infection but I don’t know if that’s risky at this stage. For reference, my arm(bicep) tattoo is still a bit shiny and has a few very small scabs, and is a bit flaky but seems to be healing really well. My ankle tattoo has much more significant flaking and I think some small scabs and I was planning on wearing loose pants. Thanks for the help!

An aircraft flies over a building, opening up above it as Widowmaker jumps out, putting her hand to an ear piece

Widowmaker: I've landed

Reaper: Ok, the target is Saxton Hale, he's giving a press conference about a new weapon his company Mann.co has produced, we want you to kill him and take the weapon

Widowmaker: I understand, any tricks I should be aware of?

Reaper: He has nine highly skilled body guards that he employs, they are dangerous but shouldn't be to much trouble for you, but refrain from engaging directly with Hale, he's far more dangerous then any of your previous targets

Widowmaker: Consider it done

Widowmaker starts running towards an event center in the city, on the ground of the event center Demoman and Scout sit out front looking at the street, inside Soldier and Spy walk alongside Saxton, on the left side of the building is Heavy who's looking around, trying to find any threats, Medic right behind him with his medigun on Heavy, on the other side Engineer is sitting in a lawn chair, Two sentry's on stand by next to him with a shotgun rested on his lap, on the backside of the building Pyro is sitting playing with some dolls, not really paying attention, finally on a water tower on top the building next to it sits Sniper, he's drinking some coffee,,four Jarate's placed behind him, he hears some static on an ear piece checking it

Spy: This is Spy, checking how things are outside

Soldier: Everything is fine where I am

Spy: I know you imbecile, I'm right beside you

Heavy: Everything is ok on east side of building

Medic: We have yet to see any threats but we'll keep you updated

Engineer: West sides looking mighty fine, I'm ready with my Widowmaker and Sentry's if anything happens

Scout: we're fine here,  no problems in sight

Demoman let's out a belch, putting his whiskey aside

Demoman: aye, no threats, not yet

Pyro let's out some mumbles, Spy sighing as he nods

Spy: I'll assume that means your fine Pyro, Sniper, how are things looking up top?

Sniper: Nothing yet Mate, I'll update you if I see anything though

Sniper finishes his coffee, pouring a new cup as he approaches the railing, looking around, meanwhile Widowmaker has reached the building across from the Center, looking down as she scopes in, looking at Scout and Demoman

Widowmaker: Hmmm, these must be the mercenaries, they don't seem the most focused, should be a piece of cake

Widowmaker jumps off the building, grappling on to the center and moving to the roof, Scout looks up having heard to cord, putting his hand to the ear piece

Scout: Hey Sniper, see anything up there? Thought I heard something

Sniper: I'll look around Mate, hang tight

Sniper grabs his Sniper, looking around the roof before seeing Widow approaching a glass panel on the roof, starting to open it

Sniper: Well now, a lass like you, I don't think you'll make it to far

Widow opens the panel, pulling Widows Kiss from her back as she scopes in but hears something, looking around before seeing Sniper, focusing in as they both look at each other

Widowmaker: Well now, I suppose you'll be first

Sniper: Let's make this quick

**Fight**

Sniper and widow fire, dodging each other's shots , Sniper reloads ducking behind the water towers side as Widow fires

Widow: You can't hide

Widow aims at a lower part of the tower, charging a shot, Sniper puts his hand to the ear piece

Sniper: Oi, wankers, we got bloody company on the roof

Spy: do you need back up?

Scout: I can get up there real fast Sniper

Sniper: I've got it, I'll let you know if I

Snipers cut off as Widow shoots a structural piece on the tower, breaking it and making the tower start collapsing, Sniper runs on the falling side, jumping and taking aim, firing but Widow jumps away, running as Sniper lands, rolling to break his fall, catching a bullet, loading it and firing, Widow ducking behind a stairwell landing, turning the corner and firing, Sniper ducking behind a vent duct as he reloads

Sniper: One shots all it'll take, one opening

He pulls a Jarate, throwing it into the air, Widow shooting it as Sniper takes aim, firing, Widow ducking but getting hit in the shoulder, Widow seems unfazed though running out as the Widow's Kiss turns to its AR mode, Sniper pulling his Smg and jumping over the vent shaft, the two firing as they approach, the bullets bouncing off each other as Widow tackles into Sniper making him take a few steps back jumping up and kicking him in the face, Sniper takes a step back before punching Widow in the face, grabbing her arm and throwing her over his shoulder, pulling his Machete and going for the neck, Widowmaker rolling over to dodge, spinning around and delivering a back kick, Sniper taking a step back, Widow pulling the Widow's Kiss and going to shot Sniper pushing the Widow's Kiss up to keep the shots from hitting him as he swings his Machete over head, going for Widowmakers neck but Widow side steps, kicking him in the side and aiming the Widow's Kiss

Widowmaker: Au revoir

Widow fires but Sniper manages to hit the gun knocking it off course before kicking the Widow's Kiss away, Widow dodges a swing of Snipers Machete, jumping back, grabbing the Widows Kiss and doing a back flip into the building

Sniper: Team, she escaped into the building

Spy: Everyone meet with me and soldier, Mr Hale asked us to keep him from needing to fight today, we should hold up that deal

Sniper: Can't do that mate

Sniper approaches the window, loading his Smg

Spy: Mundy, don't do anything stupid

Sniper: She can't be aloud to keep going while we wait, I'm going to catch her before she causes any harm, just keep an eye out while I hunt

He puts his Smg on his belt as he pulls the Huntsman off his back, jumping into the building, meanwhile Widow has ducked into a room, bandaging her wound as she hears a voice on the intercom

Reaper: Is the mission going as planned?

Widowmaker: Slight complications, I ran into one of the aforementioned mercenaries, a fellow Sniper

Reaper: Did you kill him yet?

Widowmaker: He's skilled, I need time to dispose of him if I'm to win this battle

Reaper: Kill all of them if you have to, but the boss will not tolerate it should you fail this mission

Widowmaker: I will complete it, just give me time

Sniper approaches the room, pulling the bow string back before kicking the door open, jumping inside and firing

She's a distance runner and previously went to a catholic elementary through middle school where her current club coach teaches at. They've known each other for quite sometime, since she was in 4th grade I believe (we just finished our junior year) and she currently runs for his non profit running club aimed towards encouraging kids of color to run, something which this coach seems passionate about. They've known each other through him teaching her and through running, so reasonably so they've grown quite comfortable and familiar with each other. 

I ran track last year but didn't this year, and last year the coach became an assistant coach for the high school track and XC team. I didn't think much of this or them, because I thought it was sweet how much he wanted to help her out and be there for her like a mentor. But recently, I've grown incredibly concerned after he recently started helping her with college research, and noticed a lot of concerning things I previously never dug deep into to consider. 

At the start of the year, he offered to help her out with college research, something which I felt was really nice from the coach to do. The first meeting was normal, at a coffee shop for a couple hours, just the two of them in a public space. (He has a male runner who ran on the club team and went to the same catholic school and is the same age as her who he hadn't reached out for offering help, which I thought was a bit odd). The first meeting was fine, then a couple weeks later, on a holiday, they had a meeting that struck out red flags for me in terms of location and time. It was freezing outside, and as it was a holiday, the rec centers were closed, and with them planning to do research, he picked her up at her house, drove to the catholic school which was empty because of holiday to use a treadmill in the gym since it was dangerously freezing outside to run. I didn't see much to it. Afterwards, he took her to eat at a diner for roughly an hour and a half, where I was under the impression they would do their research at since it's a public spot. But then, they mutually agreed to continue researching at the school that was empty except for a janitor that showed up while they were researching, for roughly 3-4 hours, around the same duration as their other meetings in public. The diner from what I was told was crowded and loud and not a good place to research, but I feel like an empty classroom in an empty school closed for a holiday was absolutely not appropriate, given its private and no where near public enough for a teenage girl and male adult. I talked to my dad about this who teaches high school and coaches high school girls, and he told me no male coach/teacher in their right mind would choose a setting as private as this for that many hours. I grew increasingly worried and asked her if she was confortable and if nothing bad happened while they were alone in the building, and she reassured me everything was fine and that she's known him for so long she didn't think the setting was as bad as it looked. (From my talks with her nothing really seems suspicious and it seems like nothing bad or inappropriate happened at the school,  but I don't like that he as a male adult put a female teenager in that position). She isn't the first person to have these meetings, as during covid he set virtual meetings with a bunch of former alumni from the middle school to help. I know safesport has guidelines about 1 on 1 meetings with athletes, but I don't know if the coach was fully aware about them. The circumstances mentioned were the reasons the meeting took place there, but I don't like that he took her back to the school knowing they'd practically be the only ones there. 

After this meeting, I grew worried, and reflected on details about his interactions towards her to see if there was something wrong. His move to be the assistant coach at my high school likely was driven because she ran there, and I remember last year (possibly not to overstep his role as an assistant coach) he'd take her and only her to the nearby recreational center by my school to work on weights and strength, something which he thankfully offers to all athletes now from what I hear. But I thought it was definitely odd. He had another 2 college research meetings with her after the meeting at the empty school, but would often take close to an hour at a fast food restaurant beforehand to chit chat before getting onto research, these meetings happening on the weekend after the teams preseason long runs. I grew worried that maybe he didn't seem too focused on researching and felt like he maybe saw it more as an opportunity to spend time and socialize with her. He would help her research schools and help her contact coaches, but would then start helping her with things he doesn't seem qualified to help her out with, especially for hours on end. 

He'd text her frequently, nothing flirtatious or seemingly inappropriate, but it'd be frequent, sometimes late at night when me and her are on late night dates. I grew concerned. Sometimes, if she hadn't replied within a couple hours, he'd find a reason to reach out again, maybe to get her talking to him again. I don't like this part one bit.

He'd give her and her sister (who also runs) treats and snacks after taking tests, which I'd find as nice and generous, but given everything else I feel like it could condition her to feel like she would be ungrateful to see him as overly personal. Sometimes these food gifts extend to the family, which has pretty big trust in the coach and they've grown close. 

Before prom, she ran earlier and missed practice to make a nail appointment, which her sister said made the coach panic and immediately start asking where she was, questioning where she was and trying to get it out of the sister when she said she didn't know. 

Some girls on the team had a problem with the way he'd text them and the frequency, which made them reach out to a counselor who is also the distance head coach. 

He had also told the group of girls and my gf before a meet good luck and that he loved them, maybe out of meaning it to be a kind non-romantic form of love but it was something that made them uncomfortable. He seems to be overly invested in her, and seems to give her a bit of favoratism, like when helping her and her friend (who lives in a different state through virtual meetings) with college research rather than the boy who ran for the club. But there's many things that it could be, such as a potential savior bias, likely having a good heart but not realizing how these actions look, being overly committed towards his former students and current athletes, etc. I brought these concerns to the school counselor/head coach, and they seemed to take them seriously, but as nothing really says the coach did something illegally inappropriate, the best situation seemed to have a firm conversation with him about boundaries, which I agreed with. 

For the past months this has drained and weighed heavily on me, because I know the coach is dedicated and driven on helping students and athletes and has built familiarity and trust with my girlfriend, who sees him as like a mentor figure. But something in my gut can't let go of the fear that with all the boundary crossing and norm and regulation crossings that maybe it's deeper than just a coach who has no idea of how his actions and behaviors are being perceived, and my worst fear is that maybe he has some sort of romantic attraction or emotional attachment to her that's behind wanting to be helpful. Her sister says despite thinking he's really personal she doesn't think he could be ""that"" kind of weird person at all given his kind and wanting to do right nature. He seems like a really nice guy, which is what makes me question how to feel and see his actions and behaviors. Could all this be justified by him knowing her for a while and being dedicated and driven to help kids with education and Athletics, especially those of color?",1,1750455717.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

She's been incredibly hard on me, gaslighting me, betraying me, punishing me for truly absolutely nothing, and denying my reality for as long as I can remember. Really, as far back as I have consciousness. 

3 years ago my dad had a stroke. He was in hospital then rehab for 9 weeks. I did what needed doing. My youngest sibling was helpful too. My middle sibling never came to see him and didn't visit him at home until 3 months after he'd been discharged. 

My dad and I had wonderful conversations.l during his rehabilitation. We made peace where we needed resolution. He forgave me. I forgave him. She was kinder to me and respectful to me in ways I had never experienced. 

I thought we'd somehow managed to turn a corner at this late stage. 

2 years ago, their financial advisor again notified them they were outspending their savings. They woke up as much as they were capable. Their big concession to helping themselves was to cancel daily +Sunday delivery of the Inquirer. 

They decided to sell their condo and rent. I offered everything: go with them to look at places, denied; put an ADU on my property leaving their only housing expenses the delta on utilities, absolutely not; help them budget, no thank you; help them pack, we're fine; send an electrician to their new place to install a personal hygiene appliance they have had for years and are accustomed to using to help with the transition, we have it covered; send over my interior designer & my organizer to help them get settled and sorted out in their new place, dead silence. 

My dad called me to tell me what time we'd be gathering for Thanksgiving at their place in a few weeks. It was a neutral & uneventful conversation. 

Three days later, I received the nastiest, most hateful email blaming me for their financial situation and describing my exceptional failure to be respectful of the situation in which they now found themselves. I am the eldest of 3. Neither of my brothers received similar communications from them. 

I was heartbroken and really fucking angry.

My biological mother didn't birth me to be anyone's emotional punching bag. It took me so very long to internalize this truth enough to actually step away and stay away. 

I'm so conflicted about my dad. I feel like he knows better than to stand idly by here. I also know he is loyal to her to his own detriment (and to mine and my brothers). I contacted him after 6 or 7 months and told him a wanted a relationship with him. His terms were for me to be respectful to my mother or nothing. My only response I was that if she apologized, I would be willing for her to join us for a coffee. Nope. 

I've not seen them since we were all at my Aunt and Uncle's last Thanksgiving which was the first time I'd seen them since 2023. 

It's incredibly painful every day even though it's the right decision for my self-esteem and my self-care. 

I really don't know how to quell this ache in my heart and lump in my throat. I'm often on the verge of tears. I can feel the anguish of the hurt and confused child in me all the time. 

This no/low contact is best for me. Of that I have no doubt.

Part 1:



The Private Investigator

  
  
  
  


“The Killer awoke before dawn,



He put his boots on,



He took a face from the Ancient Gallery and



He walked on down the hall.”



\-Jim Morrison

  
  
  
  


Quarter to three in the mornin’. Sal’s place. A run-down sewer in a bad part’a town. Two hours ago the place was infested with slimeballs and lowlifes. The kinda place the cops steered clear of. Even the rats complained to the sanitation department. They said at Sal’s, the only safe place to hide your dough was under a bar’a soap. If you could find one.



I had nine shots in me. The first came from Pfizer. Second one came from an old bullet wound from ‘Nam the doctor never managed to get out. The next seven came from my own despair in the form’a the whiskey I had just downed.



On a night like this, I was feelin’ all nine.



Somethin’ smelled. Not unusual for Sal’s place. But this smell was kinda nice. Maybe five six, five seven, dad was a retired stockbroker livin’ life in a sea-side penthouse in Miami kinda smell. There she was, enterin’ the place. Her stare reeled me in like a fish on a hook and in a minute I was buyin’ her a drink and she was buyin’ my soul.



The jukebox in the corner wailed the blues as the woman asked my name.



“You can call me Mr. Nobody,” I said, and she raised one corner of her lips in amusement, the other in disdain.



“And what are you doing in a place like this, *Mr. Nobody*?”



“I was just about to ask ya the same thing. Sal’s ain’t exactly a place for a lady like yourself.”



“And why is that?”



“Well, the only ladies that come here are ladies of the night.”



“And what makes you think I’m not?”



“Not what?”



“A lady of the night.”



“Look,” I said. “I don’t know who ya are but I know for certain who you’re not. The only reason someone like ya would come here would be to close a contract if ya catch my meanin’.”



“I have no idea what you mean,” she said, takin’ a sip from the glass I bought her. I sighed. She was an open book.



“The moment you came in here everyone turned to look at ya. Not cause you’re a magnet to the eyes, which ya might be, but cause they could smell the cash. Look around. This ain’t the kinda place for someone who’s just passin’ by, or someone stupid enough to pretend she’s somethin’ she’s not.”



She stared at me, her smile droppin’ in an instant. “You’ve got a sharp eye,” she said.



“It’s my job. Besides, you’ve got a bad disguise. If I had to guess, your friend arrived already. Just came outta the bathroom. He’s right there.” I pointed at the fat baldin’ man smokin’ a cigar in the corner. “From what I hear he leaves not a single trace. So beat it toots,” I said, hopin’ the dame wasn’t as naive as she seemed.



“Maybe not so sharp after all,” she said and her smile returned, takin’ another sip.



Sometimes I still live in the jungle. The air that makes ya feel like you’re in a pool’a sweat, the mosquitos suckin’ your blood, drainin’ the life outta ya faster than the Charlies, and the Charlies themselves that blended with the farmers like snakes in the tall grass. Sometimes the snakes blended so well we’d burn the entire field, but sometimes I’d see one slip, see one reach for his pocket when we whipped out our Zippos. The dame reminded me of a Charlie then, a snake, coiled up and ready to strike. And I knew I was in the jungle again.



“What exactly is your job?” she asked.



“If I told ya, I wouldn’t be doin’ my job well.”



“An undercover cop?”



“Sure,” I said, and I signaled Sal for another drink. He was a talkative sort, but that night he was silent as a corpse, sweatin’ buckets like he was back in the jungle with me even in this cold winter night. I swore he had just come back from outside too. “You alright there Sal?”



He nodded and poured me another shot. My eighth of the night. The blues music must’ve been really gettin’ to me.



“Well, your attempt to appear mysterious and enticing isn’t exactly doing you any favors,” the lady said.



“Listen sweetheart, I’m not tryin’ to appear any way. I’m just tryin’ to enjoy my drink in peace. If you have somethin’ to say to me, say it,” I said, and I really did want her to say somethin’, but she just stood there a long while, sayin’ nothin’. I played with my glass in the silence, in the blues, lookin’ at her.



“Sad music like this is a blessing for the sinner,” she said at last, starin’ off into the distance like Sal would every now and then, like people said I did. “It lets me know that even if I can’t cry anymore, someone else out there is crying for me, listening to this music.” She wiped at her tearless eyes.



At that moment she seemed to me a gal with nothin’ to lose. On her last leg, fightin’ against somethin’ I couldn’t see, somethin’ I couldn’t understand. Why the hell she chose to come to Sal’s that night I’ll never know, but throughout the years I’ve had my guesses.



Not a single trace, I told her.



“Say, have you ever killed someone before?” she asked.



“That’s not the kinda question you just go askin’ people, least of all here.”



“But I asked it anyway, didn’t I?”



I looked at her, and for the first time I noticed scars on her arms she wasn’t afraid to hide. Maybe she was right, my eyes weren’t the sharpest. I downed my glass. “Yeah. Three someones. That I know of. Self-defense.”



“Self-defense?”



“Yeah,” I said. “Do Lung bridge in ‘Nam. One frag, three bodies.” I lit a cigarette and she stared at me. “How ’bout yourself?”



“I tried once,”  she smiled. A far-away kinda smile that matched the look in her eyes. She rubbed her wrists. “Also self-defense.”



In the corner of my eye I caught Sal starin’ at me, wipin’ a glass, tappin’ his feet out of sync with the blues. Nervous tappin’.



“How do you think it felt like?” she asked.



“What?”



“Dying. How do you think dying felt like for the people you killed?”



I sighed. “Well, there was a lot of screamin’ so I bet it felt very painful.”



“That’s the thing, isn’t it? We’d all die if it weren’t for the pain,” she said, and I thought it the strangest thing I’d heard.



Part 2:



The Bartender

  
  
  
  


“There are few reasons for telling the truth, but for lying the number is infinite.”



\-Fermín Romero de Torres

  
  
  
  


You see a lot of things in this place. Lotta things most people haven’t seen. I remember in my father’s day I saw my first dead body here. Barely had teeth in my mouth I was so young. I remember the dead man didn’t have many teeth either. Pop was wiping the red floor with a mop right behind the bar, scrubbing it clean with all the cleaning products holed up in the closet, one of our most frequent customers standing behind him all the while, barking instructions. I remember he looked at me then, something wild in his eyes. Whether it was fear for me or himself I didn’t know, but I ran out of here as fast as I could before the old customer saw me too. I stood behind that same bar that night when Jack was talking to that strange woman, and the two mafiosos in the corner were arguing, and the cab driver in the other corner, silent as the corpse in the bathroom. And I could imagine for the first time what my father truly felt like all those years ago.



For the life of me I couldn’t remember who went into the bathroom with that man, skinny as a needle and pale as cocaine. They all did. None of them did. I don’t remember. Only the woman. Only the woman I am certain didn’t go. She came after I found the body.



There it was, face down in a pool of piss and blood. I didn’t even know the man. Never had seen him before, but his first day at Sal’s and he ends up dead. As if this place’s reputation wasn’t bad enough. I got the money I stashed in the bathroom and headed back to the bar to call the police. I picked up the phone and started dialing, but all I could think about was how no one had left the place since the newly deceased came in. 



Someone here was the murderer. Someone who would hear me make the call.



So I put on my coat and went to the payphone outside. I was already cold enough just from seeing that body and the walk outside didn’t help getting me any warmer. I came back indoors, hugging myself from the chill, hugging myself from the stress. The police would be here soon, I told myself. I just had one impossible task ahead of me: close off the bathroom and make sure no one leaves. I wouldn’t let that killer have a chance at escape. This place that was my father’s God rest his soul, this place that was mine, didn’t need another murderer roaming free. Pop let one get away, probably let more than one for all I know. But I was going to keep Sal’s as clean a place as possible. 



But it’s easier to shake off cancer than a dirty reputation.



Chris, barely older than my nephew, a head of hair on him like a lion’s mane, came up to me for a drink and I obliged him. For all I knew he was the murderer. He’d been getting in with bad folks on all sides of town. But I’d seen this kid grow up throughout the years. His toughness was a broken mask with so many cracks in it you wondered how he couldn’t tell it was dangling off of him. No way Chris was the killer. I’d be able to see his guilt.



His friend though, I wasn’t too sure about. Chris had brought him here a few times in the past. He seemed like more of a higher up he was sucking up to than a partner. But what would a high level gangster benefit from from killing someone in so public a place? You’d think he’d have the wisdom to just up and leave the bar if he did, but no; the corpse was in the stall and the gangster remained in the corner. Whoever the killer was, he wasn’t a good one.



The cab driver came to Sal’s every night before his shift and rarely talked sober. He had not a single qualification of being a good killer by my reckoning. He’d dodged the draft, so there was that. Broke his own knee on purpose and boasted about it on many a drunken tirade. I supposed he could’ve been the murderer. Yet still there was no purpose. But did killers need a purpose to kill? There was that Gacy fellow who’d just been caught. What was it, thirty murders? He didn’t need a reason to kill.



Then there was Jack. Cold blooded killer that one. I still remember the screams…the fire. But ‘Nam turned most doe-eyed young men into killers. Couldn’t blame Jack for being what I was. He told me he was falling for a client a few months back. Barely saw him afterwards and when I did it was just in passing. Thought he finally was going sober after all his talk. But he started frequenting again a week before the murder, drinking more than I thought a human liver could handle. Though I had no doubt he wasn’t the murderer, if he was, I wouldn’t speak against him. I’d trust him to have his reasons and I wouldn’t question him on it. After all, he’d kept his mouth shut after ‘Nam.

“What do you mean he’s dead?” I whispered. Calm, I told myself, though I could feel the panic rising in me with every breath. I couldn’t help playing with my watch, dulled gray from my touch over the years but still had that shine.



Christopher sighed. “He had blood comin’ outta him, he was colder than a bag of ice, whaddya want me to say?”



“Where’s the body?” I asked, my voice still steady, still smooth.



“On the floor like I said.”



“*Where* on the floor?”



“In the stall in the corner. It’s not like it’s easy to find. Not so hard either,” he said.



I leaned in close. “Then what are we still doin’ here?”



“Hell if I know. Orders came from Jackie. Whaddya want me to do eh?”



I sat there a good minute and collected my thoughts. Of all times for shit to hit the fan. I’d have to postpone my other appointment tonight. Somethin’ wasn’t right. “He took all of it huh? Could’ve been too much for him.”



“Nah Ton’ I told you. He had blood comin’ out of him.” Christopher shook his head, cigarette in hand.



“And you said he had flat pockets. Doesn’t make any sense. You see anyone come after him?”



“I don’t know Ton’. Don’t think so.”



“Well stayin’ here won’t do us any favors.” I stood, legs aching from hours of sitting. “Get up.”



“But Jackie said—”



“Fuck Jackie. We gotta leave before the cops get here. Next person to use that stall will be in for the surprise of a lifetime and I don’t wanna be here when that happens.”



“We don’t even have a car,” Christopher said.



“We’ll get a cab, come on,” I said, but he remained seated.



“Paulie was gonna pick us up at three anyways. Let’s just wait a couple minutes.”



I sighed and checked my watch. *Two-fifty-three. Seven minutes.* I sat back down and lit a cigar to ease the tension. “The hell he wants us to wait for anyway?”



“Reconnaissance or some shit. Wants to make sure everything went smoothly.”



I swear my heart stopped beating then. “What?”



“You know,” he shrugged. “He wants to hear first hand that it all went well.”



“He wants to hear that it went well?” Blood was flowing boiling hot to my head. I was afraid I would burst. With an old heart like mine…I was too old for this line of work. Clearly I wasn’t the only one who thought that.



“Yeah,” Chistopher said. He looked confused, like I was accusin’ him of somethin’ he didn’t do. He pulled out a cigarette and sat it on his lip.



“And you don’t see anything wrong with that?”



“Don’t beat around the bush Ton’.”



“Did you hit your head or somethin’?”



“I don’t know.” He patted his forehead.



I slapped his forehead.



He recoiled from the blow and flinched as I raised my hand again. “Paulie’s comin’ to see that everything went alright.” I slapped him. The cigarette fell from his mouth. “Is everything alright?” I cuffed him on the head. “Is everything alright?” I almost slapped him again.



“Easy Ton’!” he cried, his hand above his head ready for the next blow.



Calm, I told myself, and saw everyone in the room glaring at me. The cop that’d been trailing me the last few days, Sal, paler than I ever saw him before, the cab driver in the corner, Marie chatting with the cab driver. Everyone.



“Put your hands down,” I muttered through clenched teeth, puffing on the cigar.



“But, Ton’—”



“But nothin’!” I hissed, leaning in close enough for him to feel the heat off my breath. 



Christopher’s face turned red as he picked up his cigarette from the table and lit it shakily. “Alright, alright. I get it. Calm down, eh?”



“Don’t fuckin’ tell me to calm down,” I said, my voice low but sharp. “You think Jackie sent us here just for a goddamn welfare check? Huh? No, he sent us here to hang ourselves.”



Christopher frowned, exhaling a plume of smoke. “Jackie? Nah, come on, Ton’. He wouldn’t—”



I slammed my hand on the table, making the silverware jump. A few heads turned, and I gave them a quick, sharp glare. “You think this is a coincidence? The guy drops dead in a stall, blood everywhere, pockets empty. Then Paulie’s comin’ to check our homework? No, Christopher. Jackie’s settin’ us up to take the fall, and you’re sittin’ here like we’re playin’ checkers.”



“So…what do we do?”



“We don’t wait for Paulie, that’s for goddamn sure.” I stubbed out the cigar, grabbing my coat. “We’re gonna find our own ride outta here, lay low, and figure out how to fix this before it fixes us.”



As I stood, I noticed the undercover cop pretending to be real interested in his coffee. The bell above the door jingled. In walked Paulie, his leather jacket creaking as he scanned the room. His eyes landed on us immediately, and his face split into a grin that didn’t reach his eyes.



“Ah, there’s my boys,” Paulie said, striding over like he owned the joint. “Hope I didn’t keep ya waitin’.”



“Not at all, Paulie,” I said, forcing a smile. “We were just talkin’ about you.”



Paulie chuckled, but there was no humor in it. “Yeah? What kinda nice things you got to say about ol’ Paulie, huh? Tony can tell me on the ride back.” He motioned towards the door. Christopher stepped forward and looked at me, waitin’, but there was somethin’ off about him, like he was walkin’ a dog rather than walkin’ to our deaths. Standing there, he seemed like he was my escort into the gates of hell.

“We can’t always fight nature. We can’t fight change. We can’t fight gravity. We can’t fight nothin’. My whole life, all I ever did was fight. But I can’t give up neither. I can’t fight my own nature. That’s the paradox.”

It came on slow, like a knife dragged lightly over skin, not enough to draw blood but just enough to remind you it could. It was patient, knowing it had all the time in the world. No one would know. Just one time. Just to steady the hands, to calm the noise.



I curled my fingers against the edge of the bathroom sink. It was cold and cracked, years of grime built up like sediment around its base. I’d been here before, a hundred times, maybe more. Same room, different fixtures. The kind of place that forgot about itself long before anyone else did. The perfect kind of place. Yes, of course it would all end here.



My face stared back at me in the mirror. Was that really my face? Sunken cheeks, red-rimmed eyes that never quite closed all the way, a jaw that wouldn’t stop twitching.



I breathed deep. Three. Four. Five. The ache in my chest stretched outwards through me. I could still see her face, crumpled in the doorway of our old apartment. “Where are you going, Aaron?” I never told her. Never told her what I’d done to keep her safe, what I owed to keep the wolves off our doorstep. All she saw was me leaving, not knowing why. It was for the best. I knew that. Why did I have to keep reminding myself? “You think I don’t know? You think I’m stupid? You’re with someone else.”



I gritted my teeth, hands shaking on the porcelain, the fight pouring out of me like the faucet water. I was already at the edge, and the drop didn’t seem so far anymore. The plastic bag sat in my coat pocket, waiting for me to give in. I hated it for being there and hated myself more for knowing I would pull it out.



When I did, I didn’t even bother locking the door.



It took some time. Long enough for the regret to settle in like it always would. The room turned inside out. My body felt too big and too small all at once, my skin hot and itchy as if something crawled underneath it. I stumbled back and sat down hard on the toilet lid, the sound of the creaking seat echoing in my head like thunder. My vision cracked in two. The walls seemed to melt. Sliding, dripping like candle wax.



And then came the sounds.



Everything in the room breathed. I swear to God, I could hear it. The rustle of mold spreading under the paint, the *tisk-tisk-tisk* of the roaches crawling behind the walls. I squeezed my eyes shut, but it didn’t stop. The bar beyond the bathroom door howled, voices twisting into cries, laughs becoming screams, footsteps pounding like hammers into my skull. I slammed my hands against my ears, but my brain was inside out, and the noise wasn’t outside, it was in.



I gasped for air and the smell, God, the smell. Bleach mixed with piss and something rancid I couldn’t guess at. I gagged, but nothing came up. My lungs rattled.



The tiles beneath my feet cracked and swirled into spirals, black veins spreading like frostbite over the grout lines. I was sinking. Sinking into the center of something I couldn’t see.



I had to leave. I had to move.



I lurched toward the door, stumbling over my own feet, the ground shifting like water beneath me. I tried to grip the handle, but it slipped in my hand, slick with sweat that hadn’t been there before. My breath came faster now, like I couldn’t get enough of it. I turned to the mirror, and there I was, but not me.



The face looking back was twisted, staring with empty sockets where my eyes should’ve been. My mouth hung open, blood running down my chin and pooling at the hollow of my throat. It smiled, teeth rotting and crooked. I staggered back, falling back onto the toilet seat, shutting the stall door, blinking, blinking.



I tried to call out for help, but the words wouldn’t come.



They were coming. *They were coming.* They knew I was here. They knew what I’d done, what I was hiding from. My pulse slammed against my ears, and the stall door started rattling. I didn’t know if I was the one shaking it or if someone was trying to get in. The air grew heavy, thick enough to choke on. My chest felt tight, like someone had slipped a noose around it and was pulling it tighter with every second.



I thought of her again, her hands on her hips, her eyes pooled with rage. “I…I thought I loved you.”



“I’m sorry,” I whispered to no one, to her, to myself.



The rattling stopped. Silence poured in. I felt dizzy and cold, sweat drenching my shirt.



A sharp, sudden heat pulsed just below my ribs. I gasped, wheezing, gurgling. My hands pressed weakly against my stomach, and they came away warm, wet, slick.



I blinked at the floor, where the cracks in the tile looked like tiny rivers spreading out beneath me, carrying something of me away with them.



It didn’t hurt, not really. I thought it would. But everything just felt slow. My head tilted back against the side of the stall, and I stared up at the buzzing light as it flickered.



I rose, but my body didn’t. I saw it on the floor. A pale pile of bones was all it was. Through the walls I went and saw a man exiting the bathroom, the same man who’d been following me the last few days. Higher and higher I went until I saw the snow-coated city beneath me, speckled with lights, with life. The land of the living. A land to which I no longer belonged. Up, up, up I went until I couldn’t go up anymore.



Part 5:



The Seeker

  
  
  
  


“Most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they’re capable of *anything*.”



\-Noah Cross

  
  
  
  


The chill air wrapped me tighter than my coat. Gusts of wind carried flecks of snow that washed the streets of grime in a thin paint of white. The man I was looking for was nowhere to be found, but his friend stood at the edge of an alleyway, pacing about, waiting for something.



“What do you want?” the man asked, clearly bothered.



“I want you to make someone disappear,” I said.



He looked at me, cigarette in his mouth. “I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.”



“I can pay.” I took out an envelope of cash I had prepared.



“Look lady—”



“There are fifty thousand dollars in this envelope. I was supposed to meet someone else here. Your partner, I believe.”



He glared at me, cigarette in his mouth, contemplating. “Fifty grand eh?”



I nodded.



“Who do you want whacked?”



“I’ve disclosed all that information with your partner. Where is he?”



“Ahhh…he’s…preoccupied. You can hand me the cash and I can give it to him when he’s free.”



“He left with you and the other fellow at the bar just a few minutes ago,” I said, eyeing Travis exiting the bar. The owner was yelling at him, pleading with him to have another drink. Strange man, that one.



“Yeah, well, I can handle it for him,” the young man said.



“But you don’t even know what I want.”



“Sure I do. I’ve done this type of job dozens of times now. You want someone whacked.” He played with his silver watch and a wolfish smile spread his lips that completely went against my previous perception of his demeanor.



“I don’t want anyone to end up dead if that’s what you mean. I want someone to…have their past erased.”



“Ah now that is different,” he said, still smiling, staring at his watch like a lunatic. 



I thought about walking away. I could take the envelope, tuck it back in my coat, and leave this behind. The snow was falling heavier now, soft and quiet. It would cover my tracks if I just turned and walked. But I had come too far. You don’t spend weeks in the dark, chasing whispers and risking what’s left of yourself just to stop when you’re this close. There wasn’t anything to go back to, anyway. Not anymore. I would have to put my life in this man’s hands for now. Besides, Anthony did speak well of him in our brief talks; he thought of him like a son. Surely this young man wouldn’t want to wrong someone he looked up to.



“Well…” I said, and I looked at him, and for a moment, I didn’t see anything but the cold in his eyes and the edge in his grin. I glanced at Travis, lingering by the payphone, ready to dial the police if anything seemed wrong like I’d asked him too. I’d put too much trust into strangers that night, the kind of trust that was birthed from my apathy for life. 



The envelope felt heavy in my hand. Not from the money, but from what it meant. 



I had no choice, not really. 



Fifty grand was all it took. Fifty grand and years of torture.

I also don't know if it's a cluster headache, a migraine, a sinus headache. The amount of googling I've done and I don't know the cause, or what exactly this is. I'm going to try my best to describe it: it's sometimes on and off. I feel like I'm getting it mostly in the afternoon. I sleep fine and I wake up fine but hours into my day I get this sharp pain in the middle of my head. Sometimes it feels like hands are on either side of my head and squeezing it to make my head pop. When it's ""off"" I bend down and I feel heaviness in my head so there's never a moment when it's off that I think maybe it's gone cause I can still feel it

Some background, I'm a woman, mid 20s, I work a desk job, I have tinnitus. The pain in my head is sort of traveling to my ear. My ears feel like I'm on a plane.

What I've done so far: sprayed flonase up my nose, used ear drops (my ears were and still are really killing me through this. and it's not the ringing from my tinnitus it's just pain), used a warm cloth against my ears which has helped, taken hot showers, put on blue light glasses while I work, stopped drinking coffee, gone outside for walks more, drank a bunch of water, electrolytes, gone to bed at a reasonable time, ibuprofen, youtube facial exercises. Nothing but the warm cloth against my ear has helped with some relief

I ordered Magnesium Supplements that will arrive later today. It looks like I cannot ask for help to determine what it is I have exactly so any advice would be very helpful Thank you",2,1750455404.0,migraine,6,0.75,False

We’ve known each other for 4 years now. Me and my Bf got back together in April this year. He is kind of health-obsessed and because of that we both want to always have the best option in terms of food, in terms of discipline or sport or whatever it may be.. 
So anyways, we had a discussion two weeks ago about my lips because I got them done for the past five years with the same type of hyaluron. I experienced no problems. 
We discussed that he wants to have healthy kids and is concerned that if I get lip filler it will be bad for my health. I told him it's not going to do anything with my body or with my health, also because I'm healthy overall. 
He then asked „But can you withhold doing lip filler and we can do the lip filler at his sister's place?“ I haven't met his bigger sister yet because she lives a little bit far outside of the city. Meanwhile in the beauty clinic I go to it only costs 100 euros and she's doing a perfect job. Before I paid around 300 euros in another beauty clinic and they really did a dirty job.
My bf is argumenting that I'm giving my money for something cheap, but it's not cheap if she's doing a great job. Cheap doesn't directly equal a bad thing.

At the end of our discussion he also said he wants healthy kids and therefore I shouldnt want to do it. (I still have hyaluron in my lips with or without doing it again). I said „it's fine I can wait and do it your sister's place.“ 
Right now I kinda really want to do my lips. And I also don't want to be having to wait for someone else to be ready because, you know, it's my body and my decision. At the same time we are in a relationship and we talked about it together to make a decision, so I don't really know what to do. But also, I don't like a man telling me what I can or cannot do. He's argumenting that „he's a masculine man and it's just the way it is.“
He still wants me to pay for our food or sometimes I should invite him for dinner or coffee, it doesn‘t make sense to me. 

Is me wanting to do my lips a decision I can do for my own or do I listen to my bf? ",1,1750455394.0,whatdoIdo,15,0.6,False

And yes, that means I can cook. I’m short, 5’6. What I lack in height I make up for in sarcasm. I have brown eyes and brown hair and I tend to appear a bit like a 1940s hipster. I’ve frequently been labeled by others as old school, old fashioned, old world, old souled, and even neurodivergent. 

I enjoy witty banter and deep philosophical discussions. I’m passionate about things like art and history and music and literature. I actually work in the publishing and writing industry (and I DoorDash as a side gig). I love cats. I love all animals really, but it’s cats for me. I will pet your dog, but I don’t want it sleeping with me. I’m Deadhead and in my earlier, younger life, I flirted with outlaw tendencies. I’m not necessarily reformed, I’m just older and wiser now. 

I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I’ve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married lifestyle quite well. I love Harry Potter (Slytherin and proud) and I have a sticker of the deathly hallows on my car. A love for baseball runs deep in my DNA, as I am a fourth generation St. Louis Cardinals fan. My comfort shows are The Office, South Park, Family Guy, and House. 

I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word **homebody** in the dictionary, you’d see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s. 

I’ve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I’m being honest, but I’ve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it’s been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I’ve been everywhere and I’ve seen a lot. I’ve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I’ve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I’ve probably been there. 

This time around I’m looking for something different. I’m looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I’m here because I’m trying something on my own terms. I’m not here for games. I’m not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I’m doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I’m looking for. I’m not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they’ve been married for 70 years and they’ve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don’t meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness.

So here's the tea.

My best friend (21m) and I (21f) have been inseparable for the last 3 years. Like, ride-or-die, knows-my-coffee-order, calls-me-out-on-my-BS kinda close. Two years ago, I had a crush on him. Found out he’s basically trash as a love interest—but surprisingly, top-tier as a friend. So I moved on. Friendship stayed tight, no drama.

But lately? The vibes have been…off. Like tension you can cut with a knife kind of off. And not the romantic “maybe we’re falling in love” crap. No. This was straight-up “if we were alone in a room too long something NSFW would happen” tension. And guess what? It did.

We had a random convo about sex (like we always do, only this time it hit different), and one thing led to another and BOOM. We were sexting like our lives depended on it. Nudes? Almost sent. Thankfully we kept it text-only—barely.

Fast forward, he confessed that he’s had physical feelings for me for a while now. I told him same. But here’s the kicker—we pinky-promised not to let this ruin our friendship. LMAO.

But y’all. I’m in menace mode. We’re on vacation break right now, and once we meet again? It’s over for him. I’m going full Rizz God. Full tease.  I’m going to flirt with him so hard he’ll either combust or beg to be friends-with-benefits. 

Why? Because I can. Because it’s fun. Because he deserves it after that smirk he gave me when he said, “You know we’ve always had chemistry.” and also kept teasing me when with bullshit before he confessed and I just got flustered as I was panicking ahd shi thinking ts will ruin the friendship we had 

He has no idea what's coming.

Wish me luck. Or don’t. I thrive in chaos.

 I'm unemployed but I want to learn to save/budget money. I want to learn how to properly divide up my salary 🤞 and just be more responsible with my life.

Context: 
I'm an AB English fresh grad that has no luck with employment so far. I graduated last year pa. Due to personal reasons, I didn't actively start looking for a job and I started seriously looking around this year pa. After months of the constant rejection I decided to take a break and not pressure myself as much. Palagi nalang pressure dito, duon, at ngayon? Pressure cooker na ang Pinas. So I'm taking a little break. I've even considered starting a little business in hopes to at least start somewhere, y'know? 

The only savings I know is literally the old fashioned way. Yung piggy bank. Yes, it sounds silly, pero naka bili ako ng phone tsaka netbook nuon when I was a student. I still have a piggy bank now. But I also wanna go digital din. 

So far based on what I've learned and researched, eto yung na figure out ko so far:

I wanna somehow divide and utilize the bucket savings option to all of these apps. So far I have Gcash and GoTyme. Plan ko mag install sa Maya at Tonik din.

So my fixed expenses would be: Rent, Utilities (electricity, water), Internet + Mobile Plan, Insurance (Health, Life), and Subscriptions (Spotify). I wanna move out of the house in the future hence the rent option.

Variable Expenses: Groceries, Transportation, Dining out & Coffee, Shopping, Self Care.

Savings: Emergency Fund, Retirement Fund, Stocks & Mutual Fund

Sinking Funds: Travel Fund, Gift Fund, Gadget Fund

And then, if ever there's an excess... I'll just enjoy my excess.🤷 Life is too short anyways. I just wanna be more responsible with money somehow. These are just what I've gathered. I'm willing to learn. If you have any suggestions please also let me know. Please be kind as well, absolute beginner ako dito. Malay mo maka tulong din tong post sa ibang tao. Thanks.

Her small Cairo apartment, tucked above a noisy street, was her sanctuary. But three weeks ago, a hum began. It was faint at first, like a refrigerator’s drone, buried in the walls. She checked the outlets, the pipes, even the ancient air conditioner. Nothing explained it. By the fifth night, the hum sharpened into a hiss, a static that seemed to carry her name: *Amina*. It wasn’t a voice yet, just a suggestion, a rhythm in the noise. She laughed it off, blaming exhaustion, but the sound followed her. At the market, it pulsed beneath the vendors’ shouts. At work, it buzzed in the hum of her computer. She called an electrician, who found nothing. “Old buildings,” he said, shrugging.

The hum grew louder at night, no longer just a sound but a presence, heavy in the air. Amina stopped sleeping. Her dreams, when they came, were fragments of static, her name looping in a chorus of whispers. She tore her apartment apart, searching for the source. Under her bed, she found a notebook she didn’t recognize, its pages filled with her handwriting: “I hear it. I hear it. I hear it.” She hadn’t written it. She burned the notebook, but the ashes smelled wrong, like damp earth and something sour. The hum became words one night, clear and cold: “Amina, you called me.” She froze, heart pounding. The voice wasn’t outside - it was in her head, her chest, her bones.

She stopped going to work, stopped answering her phone. The hum was everywhere now, a tide drowning her thoughts. Her reflection in the bathroom mirror moved wrong, lips forming words before she spoke: “The first whisper was yours.” Amina screamed, smashing the mirror, but the shards reflected her face, still mouthing the phrase. She tried to leave Cairo, boarding a bus to Alexandria, but the hum rode with her, louder, chanting her name. She got off at a rest stop, wandered into the desert, and vanished. They found her apartment weeks later, the walls scratched with her nails, forming one sentence: “I heard it before I was born.” The hum still lingers in that apartment, tenants say, waiting for a new name to claim.

Amina’s disappearance became a local legend, whispered in coffee shops and alleyways. Her neighbors claimed they heard the hum too, but only at night, when the city quieted. It wasn’t just a sound - it carried weight, like a hand pressing on your chest. Amina’s sister, Noor, came to the apartment to collect her things. She found no trace of Amina, only a faint hum in the walls, like a heartbeat. Noor stayed one night, out of stubbornness, refusing to believe the rumors. By midnight, the hum was undeniable, curling around her like smoke. It whispered, “Noor,” though she hadn’t told anyone she was there. She fled, leaving Amina’s belongings behind.

The hum wasn’t just in the apartment now. Noor heard it in her own home, faint but growing. She tried to drown it out with music, with conversation, but it seeped through. Her dreams became Amina’s dreams - static, names, a voice that knew too much. Noor started writing, hoping to make sense of it, but her pen moved without her, scrawling, “You called me first.”

 She burned the pages, but the words reappeared on her walls, her skin. The hum was a voice now, relentless, telling her she’d always known it, always invited it. Noor stopped sleeping, stopped eating. Her reflection began to mimic Amina’s, mouthing, “The first whisper was yours.” She fought it, locking herself in silence, but the hum filled the gaps, rewriting her memories until she wasn’t sure who she was.

Noor vanished too, leaving only a note: “It’s not a sound. It’s me.” The apartment still stands, empty now. The hum waits, patient, for someone new to listen.",1,1750454919.0,ScaryStory,0,1.0,False

We have developed this pattern where I tell him when I’m calm I need help with the kids, need a break from the kids , or a date night and he pretty much says he’ll get onto it later. 

Then I get to a point where it’s actually starting to get to me and he says okay he’ll plan something or I’ll be fine wait till he’s done working (he sometimes helps during his lunch break). 

Then I get to a point where I can’t handle it, or I’m completely alone and I pretty much loose it and he’s like, geez why are you so upset?

He then takes the kids and I’m numb at that point, then we talk about it later and he pretty much agrees I did warn him. I’m always very direct about it. 

Right now I’m hurt because he’s been out 2 nights this week, which I’m fine with but they were more spontaneous and after taking the kids all day, it was a hey I’ll be home late. 

Then next day (today) my kids are in some mood and my toddler is just screaming all day. I think it’s a sleep regression. So after having them out all day because of holiday, he met up for a bit and then went out, I was set to solo bedtime during a sleep regression and then next day deal with an angry toddler which I can’t figure out what’s going on but that’s besides the point. I also have a 3-nager. My kids are not usually this wound up and angry and cranky will admit it has just been a shitty couple of days.

I also had to deal with my parents needing something and trying not to get an argument there because I’m a little sandwich right now.

Now, about the date nights we haven’t been on a proper date in a long time. He will agree to a babysitter so we can go see a marvel movie, which I like Marvel, but I don’t want to just have a babysitter to go to those movies. For our wedding anniversary in December he told me he was going to plan something because I said I was tired of always making the effort. He never got around to it apologized I said OK but I’m not going do our usual date night, where we just walk around somewhere and end up sitting in coffee shop or eating dinner. And he said OK just trust me come with me and then he drove me to an area. We walked around and got a coffee shop I was really upset and I told him if you weren’t going make the plans I would’ve done it. I didn’t do anything because you said you were going to handle it.

A couple months ago we were talking about how a family in town and we’re gonna go to a nice fancy restaurant date night since they would babysit for free, and we have not done that in years. He’s not mentioned at once even though he said he would make the plans and I didn’t even ask this time because I didn’t wanna get my hopes up. The family leaves Monday. 


Anyways, I’m just in a hiccup. I’m in the trenches with my kids. I have a good marriage and family but today I’m really miserable and I just need to. ",0,1750454835.0,Marriage,2,0.5,False

I should have asked more questions.,"It was awful being laid off so suddenly, but it didn’t take me too long to find a new administration job. The new job didn’t pay as well as my old job, but I hoped the salary was enough that I could keep my house. After racking up five thousand dollars in credit card debt over the next few months, though—even though it broke my heart—I decided I had to move. I called my realtor and told her that my daughter, Leela, and I needed to find someplace else to live.

I looked at houses all over Madison, but even the houses I didn’t like were more than I could afford. I’d nearly given up when my realtor showed me the house at 937 Maple Drive. Seeing it, I felt like my prayers had been answered. The house was in the same neighborhood as Leela’s and my old house. It was only a ten-minute walk to Leela’s school. It had two bedrooms, just like our old house, and a big basement for Leela to play in.

“It’s a bit of a fixer-upper,” my realtor said. “But it has a lot of potential. Is your husband good with his hands?”

“I’m single,” I said, a little offended he’d ask me that.  “Who used to live in the house?”

“A nice, older couple, Martha and Rupert. Martha was a teacher here in town. Her husband, Rupert, worked as an auto mechanic.”

“Why are they selling their house for so little money?”

“They’re not selling it, the bank is. Martha passed away and then Rupert—from what I heard, he just disappeared.”

“Disappeared?”

“The neighbors hadn’t seen him for a while. They worried something had happened to him, so they called the police. The police searched the house, but he wasn’t there. They think he moved in with some of his relatives in Nebraska and just didn’t tell anybody. He stopped making his mortgage payments and the bank repossessed the house and put it on the market.”

The story seemed strange, but I didn’t think too much of it. If I were older and struggling to pay my mortgage, I could picture myself running from my bills, too. Who cares about good credit when you only have a few years left to live? The house was just too good of a deal to pass up.

I’m not that handy, but the repairs didn’t look too hard. I’d repaint everything. Change the doors and windows. Sand and re-stain the hardwood. I’d never done any work like that before but, nowadays, you can learn how to do everything on YouTube. Whatever repairs I couldn’t do myself, as soon as I managed to save some money, I’d hire a contractor to do the work.

The first few weeks after Leela and I moved into the house were great. We unpacked our things and settled in. But then I started noticing even more little problems I hadn’t noticed before. Water leaked out from the dishwasher whenever I ran it. The pipes creaked all night long. The bathroom light flickered whenever I turned it on, no matter how many times I changed the bulb. None of these problems were too bad, but they were enough to keep me up at night, worrying I’d made a big mistake by buying the house and not just renting an apartment.

“At night, I keep hearing scratching noises in the basement,” Leela told me.

“It’s an old house, sweetheart,” I said. “Old houses make a lot of noises.”

My next-door neighbor, Janine, was an older woman about the same age as my mom. Not much longer after Leela and I moved in, she introduced herself and asked how Leela and I were doing.

“The house is a big project,” I told her. “I thought I’d be up for it, but now I’m not so sure. Fixing everything wrong with this house is going to take a lot more work than I thought it would. I hope I didn’t make a huge mistake.”

“Do you have anybody in your family who’s handy?”

“All my family lives in Chicago. I’m the only one out here in Wisconsin.”

“I’m sure you’ll get the house looking the way you want it to sooner than you think. It’s a great house. I knew the old owners pretty well. That house was everything to them. They bought it brand new and lived in it for close to sixty years. The husband, Rupert, always had some kind of renovation project he was working on.”

“I heard he left to live with some family in Nebraska.”

“That’s what they said. What I think, though—I think they just haven’t found his body yet.”

“What do you mean?”

“Rupert depended on Martha for everything. After she died, he wasn’t the same. He loved going for long walks on the trails in the State Forest. I think he went out for one of his long walks and just didn’t come back.”

I tried my best to ignore all the little problems in that house, but after another month of leaking water and flickering lights and creaking pipes, I couldn’t take it anymore. I watched a few YouTube videos and tried to start fixing things myself. I didn’t have much luck, though. No matter how easy the YouTube videos made it look, it was always harder when I did it.

Right as I was about to give up and beg the bank to take the house back, though, something strange happened. All the little problems in the house started fixing themselves.

I ran the dishwasher, and no water leaked out. I turned on the bathroom light and the light didn’t flicker anymore.

“It’s incredible,” I told Janine. “It’s like the house is fixing itself.”

Of course, I didn’t really believe that. I told myself the dishwasher had somehow managed to tighten its own pipes back together. The wires in the bathroom had miraculously uncrossed themselves. Looking back, I feel so dumb now.

Other strange things started happening around the house, too. I swore I’d closed my bedroom door before leaving for work (I hated Leela going into my room), but when I got home, the door would be open. I never misplaced my clothes but, every now and then, a shirt or a pair of my pants would go missing. Every time I went to the basement to do a load of laundry, I’d swear I turned the lights off, but then I’d look downstairs later that night and all the lights would be on.

Then, right as all the little problems to finally be gone, an even bigger problem appeared. After a big storm, I woke up Friday morning to find a big puddle of water on my kitchen floor. Rain had dripped through the roof and made its way right through the kitchen ceiling.

Seeing all the water damage made me feel sick. I imagined mold spreading through all the wood and drywall in the house, Leela breathing all the mold particles into her tiny lungs. I called every roofer in Madison until I finally got someone to come over right away and look at the damage.

“I can fix your roof,” the roofer said. “And your kitchen ceiling, too. But it’s going to cost a few thousand.”

I could have paid a few hundred, maybe, but not a few thousand. I told the roofer I’d think about it, but I couldn’t pay. I didn’t know what to do.

Friday night, I couldn’t sleep. I just lay in bed, imagining the mold spreading through the house, rotting the wood until the house finally collapsed in on itself.

Around two am, I was finally drifting off when I heard what sounded like someone banging a hammer on my roof.

I ran outside. The moon was shining. I could see the roof clearly. There was nobody up there. No people, no animals. Strange, I thought.

Even stranger, on Sunday it rained again, and nothing happened. I stood in the kitchen with a bucket, nervously waiting for the water to start dripping through the ceiling again, but it never did. I crawled up to the attic with a flashlight and shone the light over the underside of the roof. Somehow, the roof wasn’t leaking anymore. I noticed a step ladder right above the kitchen ceiling where the water had gotten through two days before. I swore the attic was empty when the house inspector went up there. But I told myself the step ladder must have always been there.

I got my laptop and looked through the report the inspector had sent me. I found the pictures of my attic, and I was right. The ladder wasn’t there. How did it get there?

I called the police.

“You’re saying that somebody is breaking into your house and fixing things?” the officer asked.  

“Well, I didn’t fix the leak myself,” I said.

“And you’re sure the roof was leaking?”

“Look at this big water stain.”

I pointed at the big brown stain on the ceiling. I explained that I didn’t know anybody—family or friend—who would have come by to fix the roof for me. But the officer didn’t believe me. He talked to some neighbors, and they hadn’t seen anybody coming in or out of my house either, and so he went on his way.

I bought a security camera and put it over my front door. For the next few weeks, I checked the camera footage every day after work, trying to figure out if anybody was stalking me. The people I saw in the footage were all neighbors, though. Nobody seemed out of place.

I started to relax again. I know it sounds dumb now, but I told myself that maybe the roof wasn’t leaking. It was just a really bad storm that somehow caused water to get under the shingles that one time. I was losing my mind from all the unfinished renovation stress and making little problems worse than they actually were.

As soon as I started to relax again, though, another problem appeared. The thermostat went crazy. The temperature in the house shot up to 104 degrees. No matter how many times I lowered it back to 72, the temperature climbed back up to 104.  

I called an electrician to look at the thermostat but, just like the roofer, he wanted more money to fix it than I could pay. So, I decided Leela and I would just have to live with the heat. We slept on top of our sheets, sweating through the night.

Then on our third night trying to sleep in that horrible heat, I woke up to Leela screaming. “There’s someone in the living room!”

I ran into the hallway. Leela stood next to the kitchen, looking toward the basement stairs. I grabbed her arm, carried her into the bathroom, locked the door and called the police. Two police officers arrived fifteen minutes later.

“Where did you see this man?” one of the officers asked.

Leela pointed at the thermostat. “He was right there. He wasn’t wearing any clothes.”

On the floor in front of the thermometer, I noticed a rusted screwdriver. The number on the thermometer was back at 72. The thermometer was working again.

The police officers searched all through the house, but they didn’t find anyone. The doors and windows were still locked. They checked my camera, but nobody had gone anywhere near the front door or my front lawn. There was just the thermostat, somehow fixed, and then that screwdriver.

“Maybe this house is haunted,” I told Janine, the next morning while we drank our coffee.

“At least you have helpful ghosts,” she said. “Ones that want to fix things. I wish I had ghosts like those.” She leaned closer to me. “You’re sure someone isn’t stalking you?”

“I’m a paranoid person. I’d notice if someone was following me around.”

“Someone from work maybe?”

“I see the same four people every day, and they all seem normal.”

“Just be careful.”

Leela and I were both pretty shaken by what had happened. As frightening as the whole experience was, though, it was great to have the house back to a normal temperature again. The next few nights, I slept in Leela’s bed with her, until she felt safe again. After she started normally again, I went back to my old bed, but unlike Leela, I couldn’t sleep. All night, I just lay awake, listening to the sounds in the house. The pipes contracting. The house’s walls, moaning. The overgrown tree branches rattling against the windows.

A few more months passed. October to November and into December. The temperature dropped to ten degrees Fahrenheit and then one of the worst things that could have happened in that house happened. In the dead of winter, January 10, the oil furnace went dead. The house couldn’t heat itself anymore.

I bought a few electric heaters from Walmart and put them in every room in the house but, still, I was worried Leela and I were going to freeze to death while we were sleeping.

I called about thirty furnace repair companies, but they all told me the same thing. It would cost at least twenty grand to fix it. I had no idea when I’d be able to get that much money saved. Ten years? Twenty years?

“Could I pay in installments?” I asked them.

But they all told me the same thing. Cash or cheque.

I called my parents in Chicago. I hate asking them for money, but I didn’t know what else to do.

“I’ll pay you back as soon as I can,” I promised them.

Mom and Dad said they’d see what they could do. I knew they’d probably be taking out a loan for it. I would have done that myself if my credit wasn’t wrecked. I felt horrible. Embarrassed and dumb.

The next night, I lay in bed, regretting every decision I’d made, feeling like my whole life was falling apart, when I heard a loud bang in the basement. It didn’t sound like pipes contracting. It sounded like someone banging metal against metal.  

I sat up, my heart racing.

Maybe it is just the pipes, I told myself. Maybe they’ve frozen so bad they’ve started to crack.  

Then I heard the sound again.

I got out of bed and put on my slippers. I picked up my phone, turned on the flashlight, and went into the hall. I checked on Leela first. She was sleeping in her bed.

The sound rang out again.

Clang! Clang!

It was coming from the basement—from the furnace room. I tiptoed downstairs. The furnace room lights were on. Leela and I were never down there. Why were those lights always on?

“I’ve called the police,” I shouted. “I have them on the phone with me. Whoever you are, you better leave now.”

I’d never thought I’d be so hopeful to see burst water pipes.

I poked my head into the furnace room, praying I’d see water everywhere. I didn’t see any water, though. The pipes were fine.

A decrepit-looking old man knelt next to the furnace, holding a rusted wrench. He wore nothing but filthy underwear. His skin was caked with dirt. The ends of his fingers were bloodied. He looked at me, smiling. His lips parted over his stained yellow teeth.

“Sorry if I woke you, Samantha” he said. “I’m just trying to get this furnace up and running again. It’s so cold outside. If I don’t get this fixed soon, all these pipes are going to freeze and burst.”

He knew my name. How the hell did he know my name?

I wanted to run, but I couldn’t. I was frozen. Too terrified to move.

He stood, his hammer in his hand, and walked toward me.

“Who are you?” I managed to ask him.

“My names’ Rupert. This is my house. It’s been so lonely here since Martha died. It’s so good having other people around the house again.”

Still smiling, he took another step forward.

“I thought I’d die here alone,” he said. “When you and your daughter moved in, though, I was so happy. I noticed you struggling, though. It must be hard on your own with no man in the house to take care of you. This is an old house. There’re so many problems. You really need a man around to help.”

He took another few steps forward. Now, he was close enough to me that he could hit me with his hammer now. That’s all I could picture. His hammer coming down on my head.  

“What do you want?” I stuttered.

“I want you and your daughter to enjoy this house as much as I have,” he said. “I want you to be happy here.”

I thought of Leela sleeping upstairs, and I finally snapped myself out of it. I screamed as loud as I could and then ran upstairs, woke up Leela, rushed her out of the house, and called the police.

The neighbors’ lights lit up, one after the other. Janine came outside to find out what was going on. Before I knew it, the whole street was filled with police cars.

It turned out that the old owner, Rupert, never left the house after his wife died.  When the bank started sending him letters about missed mortgage payments, he moved his mattress underneath the basement stairs. Made himself a little bedroom and closed it off with some drywall. He was able to sneak out of the room by squeezing behind the drywall, eventually coming out into the dry storage room. The cops searched his room and told me they’d found all my missing clothes, along with a few half-eaten mice carcasses and some bottles of piss.

I sold the house as soon as I could find a buyer. Then Leela and I moved in with my parents in Chicago.

If I learned anything from this experience, it’s that I’m never going to buy a fixer-up again. I don’t care how good of a deal the house is. No price is worth the headache.",7,1750454745.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It's been 43 days since I officially started my weight-loss journey, but I noticed I haven't seen any loss in weight on the scale, and not any loss in my body measurements. Am I just impatient or are there things I need to adjust?

Start: 150 lb | 5'2"" F29  
Current: Still 150 lb  
Goal: 115 lb

The only thing I know for certain after having worked out and eat healthy for 43 days is that:

1. I experience more mental clarity everyday.
2. I sleep better everyday.
3. My body feels stronger.
4. I'm getting more flexible, and moving around feels so much easier, the sluggish feeling is gone.
5. My back looks to be firming up just a bit, and so is my upper stomach with that hint of a small single ab line.

The only measurements that changed (everything else like thighs, calf, arms, neck, bust stayed the same):

Measurements at the start:  
Waist 80 cm  
Lower tummy 91 cm

Measurements now:  
Waist 78 cm  
Lower tummy 88 cm

Current lifestyle:

1. No alcohol consumption
2. Switched coffee to matcha (good for my mental health and clarity)
3. No social media consumption
4. workout 6x/wk. I prioritized building a workout schedule that optimized for fun and enjoyment.
   1. Sunday - Rest |  Monday - HIIT | Tuesday - Zumba | Wednesday - Yoga | Thursday - HIIT | Friday Hip Hop Dance | Saturday Lagree
5. Walk 7k daily -- this one I'm still working on experimenting how to make it into a daily habit. I reach it 50% of the time. Usually doing 4k to 7k steps a day.
6. Sleep by 1 AM, Wake at 9 AM. I heard sleep is very important for weight loss and hormonal regulation, among other things. This one I hit about 60% of the time so far.
7. Eat at home everyday unless out with friends once a week. -- this one I haven't been doing so hot. I think it's about 70% right.

For meals:

Homemade Brunch is always the same:  
\- unsweetened matcha latte - This week I recently switched from oat milk to almond milk to decrease sugars and calories.  
\- protein-heavy egg avocado toast - This week I switched from fried egg with olive oil to using boiled egg instead to decrease calories. I also add hemp seeds and use Dave's Killer 21 Grain bread that has 6g protein per slice.

Homemade recovery 12-16 oz smoothie is always the same:  
\- 1 banana

\- 7-9 strawberries

\- 1/3 cup of Mikuna Chocho Plant Protein Powder

\- Splash of almond milk

\- Ice

Where I notice my diet slips up more are the less repeatable meals at home, which my mom cooks. Sometimes the family eats at home -- in that case I think i can try to improve my portion sizing to be smaller. But other times our family gets take-out or eats at home 2-3 evenings a week and that is harder to measure.

I use the Ate App to track my food because I don't have the best mental detachment to be able to count macros or anything. So I focus on intuitive and mindful eating and just trying to adjust my lifestyle bit by bit so it can be as enjoyable and automatic as possible.

Should I just continue as is? Am I on the right track and maybe there will be a ""whoosh"" effect of weightloss at the end of Month 2 or Month 3? Am I being impatient?

Especially as a woman, I imagine our bodies are more complex so many the weight loss timeline looks a bit different and I just need to keep doing what I'm doing and weight longer?

I was hoping at this point to have at least 1-2 pounds down to give me some sign or motivation I'm losing weight. My clothes still don't fit.

Ugh. What is wrong with me. Why is it so hard to make kind, normal, (law abiding) friends 😭. 

Context: 

I 25F pop into a coffee shop in a town neighboring mine semi regularly. I’m a massive pot head. And there’s a legal dispensary on the same street. So I’m always in the area anyways and I love getting an iced latte before or after. This place has fast service and a lot of seating. 

Months ago, in April I met a woman who is about 44. She honestly looks like she’s in her early thirties tho. She’s an aesthetician and a former dancer. And we got to talking because i complimented her purse and she complimented me back. 

Now. The age gap gave me pause because i was raped by a 44 year old man in Massachusetts. And so age gaps can be a bit of a trigger even if it isn’t always a rationale one. HOWEVER she called herself “the straightest woman alive” so that sort of assuaged my fears.

We hung out a few times. She introduced me to her gym which I fell in love with tbh and might get a membership at. I really like chatting with her and getting tea. We are both interested in things like shopping and fashion and working out. BUT I started to notice a few troubling red flags. 

🚩 little white lies, like she claimed to have a “photogenic memory according to doctors” which she claimed meant everything she sees she remembers forever, but then she displayed forgetfulness so I was like lol 

🚩 she talks about taking Valium a lot. I literally don’t know anything about it or knew anyone takes it until I met her. But there’s been days where she messages me she was taking it multiple times a day multiple days in a row. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a therapist. But I do know it’s a strong medication and to see someone so flippant about something, even if it’s something they claim to be prescribed, it just gives me a really tight feeling in my chest. I’ve been taken advantage of by drug addicts in Massachusetts before and I really can’t afford for it to keep happening. Like emotionally I’m already diagnosed with ptsd I can’t man. I can’t. But I feel like a huge hypocrite because I take Zoloft, I take Intuive for ADHD, I do a lot of legally bought dispensary pot. I’m not anti pharmaceuticals or anti mental health I just find the way she does a “as needed” medicine so often and lets me know she does it at her older age. Off putting. It reminds me of someone else I was friends with who also left me traumatized lol. Which brings me to 

🚩 She disclosed a bipolar diagnosis to me and seems incredibly unstable but also isn’t doing an inpatient or even a partial therapy program right now. I myself don’t have bipolar disorder but my favorite uncle he had it. A ex friend of mine disclosed she had it too and she ended up traumatizing me heinously, lying to my face, spreading my nudes online, showing up to hangout blackout drunk, just scary stuff. And I’m scared this chick is going to do the same things. And I know it’s wrong of me to do. I know no two people with diagnosis are the same. We are all individuals. But she told me “at one point they thought I had borderline AND bipolar”. Is that how that works? I’ve never heard anyone say that before. But it’s scary to see a person wear so much instability on their sleeves and not be doing a damn thing about it besides “journaling” her words. 

🚩 She was considering going to a PHP or IOP group therapy day program but decided not to. If she had gone through and completed one like she originally planned I’d feel much safer. I myself completed a IOP one month ago, which she knows. So if I am tender in my own healing journey should I really be risking exposure to someone resisting therapy? Resisting healthy choices? I feel selfish but I can’t ignore what my head is telling me “you’ve been through too much already and we are not going to do it again, we can’t bare being taken advantage of by someone older who seems cool and might have more money or whatever but is setting off hella red flags AGAIN” and my head has a point.

🚩 She pretended to know of a doctor I met at a hospital that previously treated me and committed malpractice against me (as she knows) but she misgendered him. She called him a her.

Context, I DON’T like change. I still wear concert T’s I bought at shows in the 90s, I’ve been married almost 27 years and I’ve been at the same hospital for 25, ICU the past 12. 

I work 12s, days.l and my commute is 40 minutes. 

So every day, I make a cup of coffee at home and toast two S’more PopTarts which have on the drive. 

Then between 830-10 I try to get to the caf and I have either one cinnamon roll and two strips of bacon, or a muffin and bacon if they don’t have the rolls. I also have one more cup of coffee. 

Lunch hopefully is around 1330 but could be 1130-1500 if things are fkd. 
I head to the other building and they have a Subway. 
I get the same #10 with pepper jack, onions and green pepper, and mayo. 
I ALWAYS use a coupon code so that $13.49 sub is $6.99 and I have half of it at lunch; with water, and I save the other half for supper around 1700-1830, also with water. 

About every two years I all of a sudden get sick of the sub choice and pick another one from the menu that becomes my new usual. 

(For about ten years, before the PopTarts, I had microwave oatmeal daily; apple & cinnamon, until I got sick of it. 😆)

Oh, Subway isn’t open on weekends so when my every third rolls around I have to get something from elsewhere, somehow I manage. 😂

I saw Google suggested $1-$3 per square foot for beginners. I wouldn’t even know how to quantify the amount of material and time taken to paint since I haven’t had to buy new paints in a while and I don’t keep track of painting time. I think I would classify myself as a beginner since I’ve never taken any formal painting classes outside of my high school art class and I’m mostly self taught, plus I’ve never sold paintings before. I think I struggle because I’ll see a large painting being sold in a local coffee shop or something and the list price is like $2k, but then I have a slightly larger sized 2ftx4ft painting and google says it should be priced similarly because of the size, but it feels way overpriced to me and I personally wouldn’t spend $2k on either painting.

there's always one or two people that hang around afterwards for a tea and a chat. i do because it helps me feel clean. closer to god.

i made him a cappuccino. i don’t know why. he didn’t ask. but in the moment it felt like him staying back meant something. like maybe he was dealing with something and needed someone to notice.

it had foam on top. proper thick. i looked around. no one was in the room. not even footsteps outside.

i spat in it. one clean drop, pulling all the spit in my mouth forward. it disappeared straight through. left a hole in the froth. i added sugar and stirred it until it was gone.

i gave it to him by the noticeboard. he said thanks. drank it straight away. smiled. said it was hot. i watched his throat gulp when he swallowed. watched the foam on his lip. i got aroused almost instantly.

he didn’t say much after. just nodded and went back to the leaflets.

What is wrong with me. Why is it so hard to make kind, normal, (law abiding) friends 😭. 

Context: 

I 25F pop into a coffee shop in a town neighboring mine semi regularly. I’m a massive pot head. And there’s a legal dispensary on the same street. So I’m always in the area anyways and I love getting an iced latte before or after. This place has fast service and a lot of seating. 

Months ago, in April I met a woman who is about 44. She honestly looks like she’s in her early thirties tho. She’s an aesthetician and a former dancer. And we got to talking because i complimented her purse and she complimented me back. 

Now. The age gap gave me pause because i was raped by a 44 year old man in Massachusetts. And so age gaps can be a bit of a trigger even if it isn’t always a rationale one. HOWEVER she called herself “the straightest woman alive” so that sort of assuaged my fears.

We hung out a few times. She introduced me to her gym which I fell in love with tbh and might get a membership at. I really like chatting with her and getting tea. We are both interested in things like shopping and fashion and working out. BUT I started to notice a few troubling red flags. 

🚩 little white lies, like she claimed to have a “photogenic memory according to doctors” which she claimed meant everything she sees she remembers forever, but then she displayed forgetfulness so I was like lol 

🚩 she talks about taking Valium a lot. I literally don’t know anything about it or knew anyone takes it until I met her. But there’s been days where she messages me she was taking it multiple times a day multiple days in a row. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a therapist. But I do know it’s a strong medication and to see someone so flippant about something, even if it’s something they claim to be prescribed, it just gives me a really tight feeling in my chest. I’ve been taken advantage of by drug addicts in Massachusetts before and I really can’t afford for it to keep happening. Like emotionally I’m already diagnosed with ptsd I can’t man. I can’t. But I feel like a huge hypocrite because I take Zoloft, I take Intuive for ADHD, I do a lot of legally bought dispensary pot. I’m not anti pharmaceuticals or anti mental health I just find the way she does a “as needed” medicine so often and lets me know she does it at her older age. Off putting. It reminds me of someone else I was friends with who also left me traumatized lol. Which brings me to 

🚩 She disclosed a bipolar diagnosis to me and seems incredibly unstable but also isn’t doing an inpatient or even a partial therapy program right now. I myself don’t have bipolar disorder but my favorite uncle he had it. A ex friend of mine disclosed she had it too and she ended up traumatizing me heinously, lying to my face, spreading my nudes online, showing up to hangout blackout drunk, just scary stuff. And I’m scared this chick is going to do the same things. And I know it’s wrong of me to do. I know no two people with diagnosis are the same. We are all individuals. But she told me “at one point they thought I had borderline AND bipolar”. Is that how that works? I’ve never heard anyone say that before. But it’s scary to see a person wear so much instability on their sleeves and not be doing a damn thing about it besides “journaling” her words. 

🚩 She was considering going to a PHP or IOP group therapy day program but decided not to. If she had gone through and completed one like she originally planned I’d feel much safer. I myself completed a IOP one month ago, which she knows. So if I am tender in my own healing journey should I really be risking exposure to someone resisting therapy? Resisting healthy choices? I feel selfish but I can’t ignore what my head is telling me “you’ve been through too much already and we are not going to do it again, we can’t bare being taken advantage of by someone older who seems cool and might have more money or whatever but is setting off hella red flags AGAIN” and my head has a point.

🚩 She pretended to know of a doctor I met at a hospital that previously treated me and committed malpractice against me (as she knows) but she misgendered him. She called him a her. That tells me she is pretending to know who I’m talking about when she doesn’t. That’s CREEPY!!!!! Who even does that? Idc if you don’t know anyone or anything I’m talking about but I have ptsd diagnosed from multiple rapes so Im sensitive to lies and rightfully so.

How am I supposed to learn if I’m given barely any time???,"So I started two weeks ago and I have barely been given time to learn to make drinks. I only know how the espresso machine works, how the hot brewer works, but barely any time to practice making drinks, especially the ones with multiple ingredients. I have gotten used to making general hot coffee, summer berry refreshers, and lattes. 

My shift leader yesterday was all like, “make this” and it was a caramel crunch Frappuccino and I said, “I haven’t been taught how to make that, could someone teach me” and she said she’ll make it herself and told me to go make a latte for another customer. I get why she had me do the latte cause our store is always so freaking busy and by the time we finally have a lull, they have me go do dishes, which I don’t mind at all, but at what point of time will I be given time to practice???? I only get one ten minute break out of my entire work day and use that time to eat a snack and finally go to the bathroom. No time to practice at all. 

I’m the only green bean in this store. Everyone else has worked there for 2+ years. It just feels scary not knowing how to teach myself when it’s not like I have a bunch of syrups, sauces, and an espresso machine at home. I’m not into Frappuccinos and just prefer coffee, so I have no personal experience with the more complicated drinks (Frappuccinos mostly).

As of today, he is blocked and I have no intention of going back. He was arrested before for domestic violence simple assault but we had it dismissed and expunged. The relationship was verbally, emotionally, sexually, and finally financially abusive.

We went on a trip to the southwest last week and the last stop was Vegas. His friend paid for the last two hotel nights because he is rich and I paid for the first two nights (see other post if you’re interested in it) and I was telling him about how we should split everything 50/50 yada yada and he told me I need to send his friend money then to pay him back (for things that were gifts). It was around 3 am and I was exhausted laying in bed and I said I’ll do it tomorrow. He insisted I do it now. I tried but my bank account wasn’t working and it wasn’t open for me to call them so I said I will do it tomorrow morning and let’s just go to sleep since we have an early flight.

He then asked where my wallet is and I said to not touch it. Do not escalate it. Let’s just sleep. And either way I do not have as much cash on me as you’re saying I owe your friend. He then got up and found my wallet. I started recording and told him to put it down. He took the money out of my wallet and the money off the dresser I won when gambling (total a few hundred dollars) I told him to give it back and he said he will give it to his friend since he doesn’t think I will do it. So once I do it, I can have this back. (To clarify, I had no obligation to pay for half this hotel room, or half his friends coffee, or whatever else he claimed.) I told him this is theft and he has no right to do it. He proceeded to tell me his name is the one the hotel is booked under and I need to leave. He told me to go 3 times. As I was leaving I asked for my IDs back which were in my wallet. He acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. I told him to just look in his wallet and he refused to check. So I just leave and I walk around Vegas with all of my things until 5 in the morning.

I luckily was able to still get through TSA without my ID, and he saw me at the gate. He eventually gave my IDs back but refused about the cash. He said I was being childish. After the flight I venmoed his friend the money (assuming his friend would be a decent person and send it back which he did thank god) and he gave me the cash back.

He does shit like this when he is mad but usually regrets it after and feels bad. A few days later (yesterday) I mentioned it and he said that he thinks he did the right thing and he would do it again. We are broken up. Although I have my money back, I want to file a report since it is still theft. He has told me before “the only way to teach you is to traumatize you.” I think he was projecting since after he went to jail for DV he hasn’t touched me again. I genuinely think this is the only way he will understand this is wrong. I am 22 and he is 31 by the way.

I have this other thought in my head that he is not worth the trouble, do not give him any more energy, just count my blessings and leave, he will get his karma. But then I think, what if I AM his karma for everything that he did? I never stood up for myself and this is my chance to grow from it and seek some justice for me and his exes. I am sure one more legal issue will get him deported as well, but that is not my fault.

He said he won’t be with me because I’m the type of person to call the police if I have nothing to lose and they have everything to lose. I finalized the breakup by saying that you give someone the reason to call the police and you don’t get to avoid legal consequences to your horrific actions because your job requires you to be in good legal standing.

1lgf9b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PORTUGALCARALHO/comments/1lgf9b3/is_this_only_specific_to_the_north_of_portugal/,Is this only specific to the North of Portugal? (Good memories),"Being a second-generation Portuguese (both of my parents are from the Minho region), I was lucky enough to visit Portugal every two years throughout my childhood and early adulthood. Like most Portuguese immigrants, we usually spent the majority of our time in the North.

For the longest time, I never understood why people said we Portuguese are more introverted compared to the Spanish or French. Personally, I grew up surrounded by northern Portuguese energy, which felt anything but quiet:

1. Swearing in almost every sentence — **“fds”** is basically used like punctuation to emphasize opinions.
2. Women (including my mom) yelling your name at the top of their lungs to get your attention.
3. Hearing *“É pá!”* constantly — it’s basically background noise.
4. Women had zero patience — maybe it was more of a '90s or early 2000s thing, but seeing a mom smack her kid in the middle of MiniPreço was normal.
5. Everyone had some hilarious insult ready — even parents.
6. Parents would throw out some random threat like: *""Ó seu malandro do caraças, se não te calas já, levas com a chinela na tromba que até vais andar de lado, ouviste?""*
7. During festa season in your dad’s village, mornings started with rancho music blasting and women singing louder than any screamo band while wearing folk costumes.
8. The village drunk was borderline blackout, and yet somehow still held a conversation with your dad — mostly through grunts — and then insisted you’re all related.
9. You’re six, your uncles are playing sueca, and they send you and your 8-year-old cousin to the café vending machine to buy cigarettes for the whole table.
10. It’s Sunday morning. Grandma wakes you up to go to mass ""to be a good person"" — and then proceeds to gossip through the entire service.
11. It’s 11 p.m., and you’re still hanging out with cousins. Grandma comes to pick you up. Your aunt offers her coffee, but she insists it’s way past her bedtime… then stays until 3 a.m. gossiping.
12. You want to play the only sport we know and see kids with gelled hair, Nike jackets, and earrings on the field. You ask to play and they respond in French.
13. You see *avecs* pretending they don’t speak Portuguese to waiters — but speak perfect French when no one's looking.
14. You're on a family trip to Braga and your dad insists on taking the national road. It turns into a literal F1 race, with every German car passing on blind curves.
15. You're finally old enough to hit up the clubs. You approach a cute girl thinking it’ll be like in Canada. You get rejected so hard, it leaves you with PTSD.

It wasn’t until later in life that I started exploring more of Portugal. And no offense to the people from Lisbon or the South — but I was honestly thrown off by the mellow tone of the accent. No swearing. More calmness. Less chaos. I wasn’t sure if this was just a northern thing or if the culture in the south was truly that different.

Anyway, this is all based on my experience from the late '90s to now. I know times change, and maybe I sound like a stereotypical *tuga do monte*, but honestly, I saw most of this even in urban areas in the North.

So, I guess my question is:

A few months ago I decided to get on Hinge. I came across this guy (btw I’m 20F and he’s 39 yeah I know 😭). He was really attractive and looked pretty young for his age. He hearted me, I hearted him back, but I didn’t realize how old he was until after I liked him.

We had a few short conversations over the first couple of days and then he asked to move to iMessage. I gave him my number and we started texting basically every day, mostly at night because I had class and he had work. He always texted me first.

He asked to talk on the phone a few times, but I don’t like talking on the phone so I kept making excuses. He didn’t press the issue so I just let it be.

He was sweet at first but there were a few things that started to feel off. I didn’t catch them early because honestly, he was and I liked the way he talked to me. But now that I’ve blocked him and had some space to think, I know I wasn’t tripping.

For one, whenever he asked me to meet him, he always wanted to meet in a park. I go to school in Manhattan and he expected me to come all the way to Brooklyn. He never tried to meet me halfway or suggest a coffee shop or something normal. It was always, “Let’s go to the park and walk around.” That was already weird to me.

From the very beginning I asked him, “Do you usually talk to younger girls?” and he said no, that he wasn’t looking for someone younger and I was just “different.” But let’s be real, the only way I, a 20-year-old, would show up on his Hinge feed is if his settings included my age. Sooo yeah. That was a lie.

He asked what I was into sexually. I told him I was a virgin (I’m not, I just wanted to see what he’d say). He told me that was fine and that we could still do stuff and maybe he could even be my first. Like sir… no.

He would randomly ask me to send pictures. Not sexual ones, but he did say I could send those too if I was “comfortable.” I didn’t. I only sent regular pictures that were already on my Instagram. 

He’d ask me all about myself, but when I’d ask something back even something simple like “How was your day?” he’d ignore it. Every. Time. But then he’d text me random dramatic stuff like “I got hit by a car” or “Me and my dog got assaulted by a cop in the park.” Huh??? And when I asked if he was okay or if he was pressing charges, he just ignored that too. Like what am I supposed to do with that information?

I literally made up a fake boyfriend just to see if he’d back off. Instead, he said, “That’s okay, we can meet before he comes.” He actually embraced it.

Every time he asked me to meet, I said yes in the moment thinking I might actually do it. But every time the day came, I’d get this gut feeling telling me not to go. I even considered bringing a knife with me. And like… if I feel like I need to bring a weapon just to feel safe, why am I even considering going?

Was I being dramatic with the whole knife thing? and am I just delusional thinking this man wanted to kidnap me? Maybe I was … maybe he was a good guy and I was over thinking it. A few of my friends said I was overthinking it and a few said I did good. 

Part of me thinks he might’ve been married or living a double life. He gave “married man” vibes. He would text only late at night, only want to meet during the middle of the day, and disappear for days at a time. At first we texted every day, but once he realized I wasn’t actually going to meet up, he started backing off but never fully disappeared. It felt like he was just trying to keep me around in case I changed my mind.

one of my biggest concerns from the beginning was why would a 39 year old man be interested in a 20 year old girl. What do we have in common? What can we possibly be talking about? He’s literally older than my mom. part of it is also on me … I’m not only blaming him.

Carol I need a date +1 for my cousins wedding next month.  What am I going to do?

Carol: No one from upstate you could ask?

Lois: Not really. They’d get the wrong idea and no one is intending to be with.

Carol: Let’s see who in this company would be worth asking? Well no one in your department. Not ethical. Too young.
Sales department? Too married too divorced too sleepy.

Lois: Carol you do love to stereotype.

Carol: Yea makes it easier to eliminate the unworthy.
Ok Accounting?  Nah old men and young women.  
Executives?  Old but they do have money.

Lois: it’s just a date for a wedding. Must be someone my age and normal. (Sigh)

Carol:   There is one guy about your age, intelligent, decent appearance.  And you work well with him when you need to.

Lois:   Who?

Carol:   Nick from IT

Lois:   Really?  No.  Hmmm Let me think about it.

Carol:   But don’t over think it.
Back to work.

Next day Lois went into the break room first thing in the morning. Something she rarely does. But she had a need for caffeine.  Pouring a cup of coffee was Nick from IT.

Nick:  Good morning Lois.  Can I pour you a cup?

Lois nodded yes.
As Nick poured Lois said:  Nick can I ask you something?  She pointed the way to a far table.
Lois: I need to ask you something in private Nick.  But not here.  Can you meet me tomorrow after work?  But not at anyplace around here.

Nick:   Sure Lois. Text me later and we’ll figure a place to meet.  I have a meeting right now.

Lois:  that’ll work.
She let out a sigh of relief.

Nick was wondering what it was all about. But he had work to do.

Later that day Lois texted Nick:  Do you have any place we can chat away from work area?
Nick texted: You live in Hatboro and I live in Chalfont. How about Jim’s in Warminster?  Just up York rd from you.
Lois:  ok  I know where that is. 7 pm?
Nick: ok good.  I’ll meet you at the bench outside.

At 6:50 Nick sat down on the bench in front of Jim’s.  He figured it would be easier for Lois   If he was there first.
Two minutes later Lois was there.

Lois:   Nick thanks for coming.  You must be wondering what is so private not to talk at or near work.

Nick:   Lois I had several ideas what it could be.  Most were too incredible to make any sense.
But let’s get a seat and relax a second.

They were seated at a booth.  Lois ordered white wine, Nick a beer.

Nick:   Lois what would you like to eat?  They have excellent roast beef sandwiches.

Lois:   Oh nothing for me thanks.  I’m too nervous.

Nick:   Says the girl who probably only had coffee for breakfast. Eat half her sandwich for lunch. And now is drinking wine . 

Lois:   Nick have you been spying on me?  I had a bagel for breakfast and almost ate all my sandwich for lunch.  Ok? (Ok had a sarcastic tone)

Nick:  I’m going to order a few appetizers.  You can watch me eat or eat them too.
I think I’ll have loaded tater tots, stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.

Lois:   Did you say stuffed mushrooms?  Oh I love them.  Oh they have onion rings and chicken bites.  
Nick good idea! We can chat and eat comfort foods.

Nick:   I thought you may pass out on me if you didn’t eat.
So what did you want to ask me?

Lois took a sip of her wine.  Took a deep breath and said:  I have a wedding I’m invited to and I was wondering if you would be my date? 

Nick:   What happened to Jake your boyfriend?

Lois:  he hasn’t been around since before Christmas.

Nick:   Oh sorry 

Lois:   Time to move on.

Nick:   About time… to talk about the wedding.

Lois: The wedding is two weeks from Saturday.  It’s upstate and I have to be there for the rehearsal dinner on Friday.  It would be great if you could get Friday off and we can go together.  You can stay at my parents house with me and use my brothers old room.

Nick:   No problem. I have enough days owed me to get off.
But I do have a few questions.

Lois:   Ok  nothing that would make you back out?

Nick:   No just informational questions.
Are you in the wedding?

L(ois)   No she has 2 sisters and the groom has 2 sisters 

N(ick):  Father or mother side

L:    Father’s brother daughter?

N:  Another Mrs. Novak. Any other aunts uncles siblings?

L:  My father’s sister married. She’s the one who thinks she’s right all the time.
And my brother and his wife and 3 kids.

N:   Every family has one.  There is a right way a wrong way and their way. And their way is always right. You just have to work around them.

L:   Exactly 

N:  So what should I know about your dad?  What does he do? Hobbies? Sports teams? I don’t want to talk about the Phillies Eagles and he hates those teams.  

L:   He was a realtor . Retired  loves golf trains.  He likes those teams.

N:   Great plenty to talk about.  And your mom?

L:   She was a school teacher retired but still does substitute teaching.  Sewing and gardening are her hobbies.

L:   My uncle has his own business and likes golf.  My aunt is an office worker and she also sews.  3 daughters one wedding now.  

N:   Thanks Lois.   I’ll have conversation starters for your family. 

L:   Nick you were right.  Appetizers were the way to go.  I’m feeling better and relaxed.

N:   Wow we made short work of them!  Let’s get some more.  Mushrooms and crab dip?

L:   And loaded tater tots please.

N:   More wine?  I’m having another beer.  Saturday tomorrow.  You can sleep late.

L:   Sure.  Anymore questions?

N:   Just a few about you.  Anything special I should know about you? Something someone would bring up ?  Any ex boyfriend from high school days who could be jealous I’m your date? 

L:   No never dated in high school.  Doubt you have to worry about anyone. 

N:   Ok   Any questions for me?

L:   Promise me you won’t tell anyone about this.  I don’t want us to be the subject of gossip at work.  That means no posts on social media.  Ok?

N:   Yes Miss Lois I understand.  Can I tell anyone not connected with work?

L:   Like who?  Some of your golfing buddies?  I prefer you hold off until at least after the wedding please.

N:   Ok I can do that.  Even if I have to be cryptic. 

L:   Thanks Nick

N:   Thanks for asking me Lois.
So who are you going to tell?  You have to tell the bride that you’re coming with a date.  
Anyone else you want to tell?

L:   The bride and my sister in law.  We tell each other everything.  Oh if you agree Carol from work.  She and I have talked about this for a few weeks.  She suggested you but she doesn’t know yet I asked you.  

N:   Ok I know Carol can keep a secret. She’s keeping secrets for me. I trust her.

L:   You and Carol have secrets?  About?

N:   No comment 

L:   Now you are being cryptic. Any hint?  Anyone I know?  

N:   Ok I think we’re done with the appetizers and drinks. Time to go before I say something more.

L:   Are you blushing?  Oh sorry.  We better go.  
Thanks Nick for agreeing to be my date. And thanks for a great night and good food.

N:   I had a great time too!

Lois returned home feeling relieved and relaxed. She immediately texted Carol.
L:   Carol are you here?
C:   I’m here.  What’s up?
L:   Are you alone?
C:   Yes. Call me.
L:  (on the phone)  Saw Nick in the break room.  “Can I ask you something in private?  But not here.  Some place away from work tomorrow night after work.”  We met at Jim’s in Warminster. 
He insisted I have some food with my wine.  I must have looked anxious.
C:   Yes when you’re anxious overwhelmed and little food you almost look like you’re going to pass out.
L:   Does everyone know about this?
C:   Only the ones who care about you.
L:   He picked 4 good appetizers and I added 1.
I took a deep breath and a big sip of wine.  I told him I had a wedding to go to and would he be my date.  He smiled and then looked puzzled. What happened to Jake?  Told him. He said he’d be happy to be my date.  I gave him the details etc.   He had a ton of questions.  Said he wanted to know about my family so he could have conversations with them.  I never thought he wanted to be proactive.
C:   Nick really is a great guy.
L:   Then I told him he couldn’t tell anyone.  No one at work, none of his friends.  I even said not his parents until after the wedding .
I said I have to tell my family brides family and my brother and sister in law.  And if it’s okay with him I want to tell you Carol. It was ok with him because you kept some secrets for him.  Ok Carol what secrets?  
C:   I can’t tell you without Nick’s permission.
L:   Is it about me?
C:   No comment 
L:   Nick said that too.  
C:   So did it go well?  Will you be able to make it work?
L:   Better than I thought.  I think I’m going to have a good time.

Monday before the wedding Lois texts Nick
L:   Mr I’m in the mood for some stuffed mushrooms.  Are you interested?
N:   Absolutely! Jim’s about 6:30?
L:   Yes that works for me.
N:   I’ll meet you at the bench.
L:   Why not inside?
N:   Because a guy likes to walk into a place with a pretty girl by his side.
L:   So you think I’m pretty?
N:   Lois stop trying to make me blush and get back to work. I’ll see you at 6:30

At 6:30 Nick saw Lois sitting on the bench.
Lois stands up twirlers around and says teasingly 
L:   Hi Nick. Am I pretty enough for you today? 
N:   Every day Lois!
That surprised her. She thought he’d laugh it  off.

L:   I can’t stay long.  Want to get my work cleared up before I or we go to the wedding.
N:   Yes me too!
L:   Update on the wedding.  I told my cousin I was bringing a date. Not Jake the snake she said?  I told her I was bringing the guy I was dancing with at the Christmas party.
N:   You told her about that? I almost punched Jake that night.
Who else did you tell?
L:   Just Linda my sister in law. The three of us are pretty close.  I had to tell someone. Who did you tell?
N:   Carol and your boss calmed me down . Mr. Logan said I should have decked him but thanked me for being calm.
L:   Oh I need to know what you want to eat at the wedding.  Beef salmon pasta vegan.
N:   What are you having?
L:   Beef I don’t like salmon.
N:   Then I’ll have the salmon.  But we have to exchange bites.  Ok?
L:   Do I have to?
N:   Yes you do. lol 
What time do you want to leave Friday?
L:   7 ok ?  Mom will have a late breakfast for us and we have shopping to do. So you’re going to be alone with my dad.
N:   Now you know why I asked so many questions. We have a few things we can chat about.
L:   He’ll probably ask about you.
N:   I’ll assure your dad my intentions are purely honorable when it comes to Lois.
L:   That’s funny.  Luv to see that conversation.
N:   Here’s to a fun weekend.

At 7 am Nick knocks on Lois’s door 
L:   Come on in Nick
N:   Good morning Lois. You all set? Got everything?  Just two bags and garment bag?
L:    Let’s get going. I’m anxious to get there.
N:   Stop for coffee?
L:    You read my mind. Wawa coffee please.
N:    Good because I don’t do Starbucks. Too expensive.
 Loaded up with two 24oz coffees and a breakfast burrito each.
N:   Ok what town to I put in the GPS?
L:    Wyoming 
N:   The state?
L:   No it’s a town in Pa 
N:   Ok got it.  Radio? Music?
L:   Sure but just in the background.  
N:   Isn’t nice not to have to get dressed up first thing? You dress down nice.
L:   No one ever said I’m a good dress downer.
N:   Yes we always see each other in business attire. 
L:   But more formal attire tonight and tomorrow.  Can’t wait to see everyone.
N:   So tell me Miss Lois what secret thing does Lois do that would surprise people?
L:   Ok Mr Nick. But you have to go first.
N:   Oh you turned the tables on me.  Well I watch YouTube videos about the rich billionaire who bumps into a waitress or hires a new woman employee.  He falls in love with them because they don’t want anything from him. He stalks her until she agrees to go to a formal dinner with him. He buys her gown shoes etc.  come on we know he’s just trying to get into her pants.
L:   Nick is that what you’re trying to do to me? Get into my pants?
N:   What?!  Why are you always teasing me and making me blush?
L:   Because it’s so easy to tease you. Besides you blush a nice shade of red!
N:   Ugh you’re exasperating .
But these are YouTube videos so it’s strictly pg13.  Eventually he proposes with an a ring in a velvet box. Every story has the box. All the rings are elegant but simple. Yea right! Guy with billions goes for a cheap ring. Always no big weddings and most stories the guy quits his job to run a coffee shop. Nice to have a golden parachute to retire on.  Never has any kids.
Why can’t they be normal people trying to find real love get married have kids and try to live life as best they can? 
But I keep watching them hoping something will be different.
L:   Interesting.  Never know what you get on
YouTube.
My thing is I like to watch old black and white movies.  Love Fred Astir and Ginger Roger movies. Thin Man series is great. And a lot more. I usually watch them by myself.
N:   Interesting choice of movies.

Nap: A Temporal Rebuttal to Descartes","While I maintain a sincere appreciation for René Descartes’ seminal proclamation “Cogito, ergo sum” (I'm not putting it in parentheses, because we all know what it means, and the parentheses would take up too much space) 

I can’t help but find the assertion a touch superfluous, if not chronologically misaligned. After all, by 1637, rudimentary horological contraptions had already been devised. The notion that one must conjure metaphysical existence from introspective cognition merely to infer temporal presence seems, at best, a dramatic overcorrection.

Nonetheless, as an avowed diurnal enthusiast, and a morning person, I must confess that I resonate deeply with Descartes’ ontological optimism. In the AM hours, my cerebral faculties are positively effervescent; neurons fire with Cartesian clarity. I think, therefore I most assuredly it is the AM. By contrast, post-meridian, the decline is precipitous. Cognitive disintegration commences somewhere between lunch and despair. I cease to reason, I scroll aimlessly, and my ontological certainty fades like an overexposed daguerreotype.

I’m writing this at one of those strange, sleepless hours when the world is quiet, but your thoughts aren’t. Loneliness doesn’t keep office hours, and sometimes you just need to admit even to a stranger that you’re not okay.

Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit behind in life. Behind in studies, behind in milestones, but somehow always ahead in self-doubt. I thought I’d have things figured out by now… but I don’t. And maybe you don’t either. Maybe that’s okay.

I’m not here for perfectly filtered photos or quick-hit conversations. I’m hoping to find something slower. More honest. A connection built on late-night thoughts, small comforts, and the kind of conversation that doesn’t need to impress.

About me:

25M, based in Italy

Overthinker, coffee-dependent, accidentally funny when tired

Lover of deep talks, warm silences, and noticing the beauty in boring days

Currently wading through anxiety, deadlines, and existential dread but still holding on to hope and curiosity :*


About you:

You don’t have it all figured out (bonus points if you’re still working through the mess)

You miss those 2am chats that feel more like therapy than small talk

You care more about sincerity than aesthetics

You’d rather share comfort songs, half-finished thoughts, weird cravings, or unfiltered confessions than “wyd” texts


Maybe we’ll bond over burnt cookies or the absurdity of adulthood. Maybe we’ll make a space where it’s okay to just be, without pressure or pretense.

If you're tired of surface-level chatter and just want to connect 'human to human' I’m here.

And just to be clear, sincerity matters to me, but so do values. I stand with Palestine, and I’m only looking to connect with those who do too.

It all started one day when he walked right up to me and asked about an exercise I was doing and that he was looking for exercises to do. I thought the whole exchange was a bit surprising because this guy was pretty jacked so I didn’t know why he would need me for help.

A couple of days later he walked right up to me again and said he tried the exercise I was doing and it was really good, then he asked if I had any more tips. I gave him a couple of pointers and then he started asking me where I was from, how long I’ve been going to this gym, then he asked for my name and we shook hands and introduced ourselves. 

Around a week later he walked in a bit after me asked what I was hitting today, if I had plans for the night and asked me what I do for work or if I was in school. That same day I ended up giving a tip about an exercise. He seemed very appreciative, and asked more questions, like if I go to the gym on the weekends, what my split was etc.

After obsessing over him with my friends I had hope that he might be interested and I wanted to make a move. 

On Wednesday he and I were talking, and at the end of the conversation I very nervously asked ""I have a question... are you single?"" He looked a little shocked but he said yes and then asked if I was too. I said yes, then he said he would be out of town this weekend but that we should get a coffee sometime. He opened his contacts in his phone, added my name, and I put my number in….That was two days ago and he never ended up texting me :/ I also haven’t seen him at the gym since then even though we’re usually there at the same time everyday.

Did I royally fuck this up? Was he creeped out by some girl hitting on him and it made him switch gyms? 🥲 This guy seems very out of my league which is what’s making me doubt myself, but I also don’t think he would have suggested a date and asked for my number if he wasn’t interested?

(I’m Italian, and this is my first time ever posting, so apologies if I make any grammatical mistakes.)

In the summer of 2023, I met a girl during a group hangout with some friends — let’s call her Diana. At first, I thought she was annoying. But over the next few months, I saw her again a couple of times at parties. During those events, we talked, joked, and teased each other nonstop, and I started to notice a really strong chemistry between us. Still, at the time, I was hopelessly into someone else — the girl who would soon become my first girlfriend — so I completely ignored any of Diana’s approaches, often acting cold (I later found out she had a crush on me back then).

Fast forward to March 2024: the day after getting dumped by my girlfriend, Diana showed up at one of my volleyball matches (she was dragged there by some friends). That day I was emotionally wrecked and didn’t feel like talking to anyone, so I pretended not to notice her. Later that evening, she texted me first — and honestly, partly because I was amused by how persistent she was, I decided to go along with it. We ended up texting every day and night.

In May, she drove two hours just to come watch me play in a tournament. She cheered for me all day while wearing my hoodie (which she had “stolen” while I wasn’t paying attention). A few weeks later, we had our first one-on-one date: we went to the movies. It went really well — halfway through the movie, she lay down on me and rested her head on my chest. I put my arm around her, and we stayed like that until the end of the film.

When it was time to say goodbye, she hugged me and looked into my eyes for a moment, but I didn’t have the courage to kiss her. In the following weeks, we kept texting, but we couldn’t manage to meet up again — sometimes it was my fault, sometimes hers. Eventually, in July, we went our separate ways (I should mention that there was a chance I might be moving away for good that summer — which didn’t happen in the end).

In August, missing her, I tried to break the silence with a silly joke, but she responded coldly. I took that as a sign to step back and focus on myself. And it was working… until October, when she suddenly liked one of my Instagram stories. I ignored it, but she started creeping back into my mind. A few weeks later, out of nowhere, she messaged me and reopened the conversation. At first, I acted cold — I was scared of getting hurt again — but after a few days, I opened up a bit, and she quickly asked me to grab a coffee.

It went terribly: she arrived an hour late (though she stayed on the phone with me the whole time while coming), and I spilled our coffees, though she actually laughed it off. Still, I realized during that outing that even though our conversation still flowed, there was now a bit of a wall between us. Eventually, the texts faded again.

About a week later, we both had volleyball games in the same gym. We agreed that whoever finished first would go watch the other play. I finished first and went to watch her match. But when I approached her afterward, a male friend of hers came over, and she introduced us. I didn’t know at the time that they were just friends, so I convinced myself she had moved on and only saw me as a friend now. That night, we chatted a bit — it still felt easy and playful — but I didn’t pick the conversation back up afterward. And neither did she.

About a month later, we crossed paths at a professional match, but we just waved from a distance (we even pretended not to see each other at first).
At Christmas, I found the courage to wish her happy holidays, but she replied coldly again, so I decided to leave her alone for good.

Then in April 2025, we crossed paths again at another match. This time, I waved at her best friend, who was sitting next to her, and Diana turned her back and ignored me completely. I was hurt, so when I passed by her later, I ignored her too — and decided to move on for real.

But in mid-May, out of the blue, she liked a photo I posted with my mom (there’s a running inside joke about my mom between us — long story). A few days later, since it was her birthday, I decided to send her a message, but kept it short and cold. She replied with a thank-you… and a heart emoji (which she doesn’t usually do when she’s being cold).

Two weeks later, I got a follow request from her best friend on Instagram.

Now it’s June 20th. I’ve liked a couple of her “Close Friends” Instagram stories — nothing personal, just neutral content (she never removed me from Close Friends, by the way). But honestly, I don’t think I have the courage to message her.

Part of me wants to move on, but the awareness that nothing ever really happened between us — despite the amazing chemistry (which she also pointed out once) — keeps pulling my thoughts back to her, I think of her, I dream of her. And the fact that we both remained single all this time isn’t helping.

Any advice is welcome.

P.S.: I know I sound pathetic, but please don’t judge me — when it comes to relationships, I’m really clumsy and inexperienced.",0,1750453219.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

1lgexor,https://i.redd.it/umx6is8g958f1.jpeg,Final shoot is tomorrow (!!) and things are a little crazy—but I would appreciate quick advice on rings 💛,"Okayyyy so things are a bit of a whirlwind right now - final shoot is happening tomorrow, pieces are already stocked, I’m finalizing a ton of details, and basically running on a mix of excitement and fear (and way too much coffee) 😅

But in the middle of all the chaos, I really wanted to ask you all for one small bit of advice that would help a ton:

**1. What kind of ring styles do you actually wear and love?**

* Dainty and minimal?
* Chunky and bold?
* A mix of both?

The first rings are already at home and ready to go, but I’m working on ideas for upcoming drops and want them to reflect what people genuinely want to wear. Your feedback has shaped so much already, and honestly, I trust this community’s taste more than any influencer 😄

**2. Pre-ordering model (once initial stock is gone)**

This is also a big one! Since this is a fully self-funded solid gold brand (I’m literally starting from scratch), I’ll be working in smaller quantities to avoid overproduction and huge upfront costs.

I’m considering offering pre-orders for certain pieces so I can continue dropping new styles regularly (think weekly drops). Would love your thoughts on this:

Would you pre-order solid gold if it meant better pricing and more styles to choose from?

I’m starting to develop mental illness.","I (23F) work in an affluent part of London where there are many rich people, I’m currently enrolled on a degree apprenticeship on a wage that’s not even enough to rent a studio flat. The company is paying for my degree though so it’s worth not having student loans and when I graduate hopefully I’ll earn more. I still won’t be loaded like these people though. 

This may sound kinda creepy but there is a private girls high school nearby, and I see literal 16 year old girls wearing designer stuff and getting lunch with their friends after school in expensive cafes. Literally there were these girls in front of me at a posh cafe I go once a week as a treat for a coffee, they spend like £60 between the two of them. And then there’s me feeling stressed and guilty that I’m wasting money on iced coffee even though I get it once a week lol. I can’t help but envy them how carefree they are, they don’t have to worry about money and get everything they want, just from being born to rich parents. I keep wondering how cool it would have been to experience being a rich teenage girl and having rich parents. 

Then the women my own age or older, I see them going for massages/pedis every week, always having their hair and nails done and wearing luxury jewellery and clothes. Many of them are stahm or trophy wives, because they are out and about on a random Tuesday so I doubt they work. I literally fantasise about being like them, I delude myself into thinking I could marry rich or start some business and in the end I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and envy when I realise my life will never be like theirs. I feel inferior and non existent compared to them. 

The worst thing is I literally daydream in my head where I am living their lives and make fake scenarios that I wish was my life. I even dreamed up a rich husband I’m married to that doesn’t exist lmao. I believe it’s called maladaptive dreaming, I literally dissociate and do it at work and even at home and at night I can’t even sleep because of it. When I try to stop fantasising and come back to reality, I get really depressed and even burst out into tears once because of how pathetic and unhappy I am in my own life.

And I don’t know why, I don’t even want luxury items tbh I’m not a materialistic person. I just want to be able to afford to live on my own, not have to be stressed and feel guilty everytime I buy a small item, not have to put things back at the grocery store because it’s a waste of money, not have to work five days a week and still not have enough money for hobbies. I’d like to be able to travel a couple of times a year too. 

How nice would it be to go out on a random Tuesday and do yoga classes on Thursday instead of a Saturday when it’s packed. I wish I could just buy some overpriced handpicked cherries, instead of waiting until they are reduced and not as fresh so I don’t feel guilty that I’m spending unnecessarily.

**For the listener:**

 *It's the night of the Armistice Ball. The war is over. The trumpets of victory ring out clear as crystals, and the wine flows thick. As you walk up the shadowy steps to meet your Mistress, you go over what you are going to say to her. Tonight is the night everything changes.*

......

**SCRIPT:**

It all still feels unreal, at times. That you really are in my bed, looking so-

(Sighing) No, that’s terrible. What am I supposed to write? You’re looking so cute? Adorable? *Delicious*? And why is writing a letter so hard?

(Softly, to herself) It’s just a note, Stella. Something for your snowflake to read when he wakes up. This....this doesn’t have to be complicated.

(Sighing again) My dear snowflake, I....

I hope you slept well. It’s- well, it’s extremely out of character for me to write you this letter. But it’s your fault, as always. Had you woken up early for once, I wouldn’t have to do this. I hope you are happy, snoring away.

Fine. I guess you don’t snore. You just.....you make these cute little noises sometimes. You don’t know how difficult it is for me to resist the urge of cuddling you to death. It’s very difficult, forcing myself to get out of bed now.

And that’s also your fault.

It’s your fault that I seem to be smiling more frequently these days. Emmary thinks so, at least. She says a smile looks good on me. But....but I don’t know if I really deserve to smile.

(A long pause)

You know what, Snowflake? I’ll smile anyway. It’s not even under my control, honestly. I can’t control when I think of you, and thus, I cannot control when I smile. Also this line reads like it was written by an uninspired fifteen year old. But I am running out of time, and out of empty space on this little page, so I’ll get right to it-

Thank you, Snowflake. The war has almost come to an end, and I’ve won. The flags of Eluria fly proudly all over the northern continent. The skies are awash with the coloured smokes of victory- all orange and green and bright mauve. And it’d have taken me and my comrades-in-arms far, far longer without your service.

My darling. I know you resent yourself deep down, even if you hide it so well. It’s something I’m familiar with. I know you think all you’ve done is provide me the fuel to light the perfect fire, and all you can see is the black smoke rising from the charred remnants. But you’ve done more than that.

You’ve saved lives, too. You have helped to end this war early, and in the process, you’ve saved the lives of people who’d have become victims had the war run its course. You....you cannot see their faces or know their names- the strangers you’ve saved- and they do not know you, but I....I see what you’ve done, my clever little snowflake. My naive, sweet little pet. I know I said you’re not my pet, but I mean....come on (a little snicker).

It’s not like you mind. I know I quite certainly don’t.

I am grateful to you, really. I’m sorry I won’t be here when you wake up, but I must attend the celebrations. I will be missing you.

Come find me in the evening, since I know you won’t wake up anytime before noon (laughing softly).

You better not sit this one out, Snowflake. Or else I’ll be upset. There’s....there’s something I wish to give you.

Come find me at the Armistice Ball. The lights along the road will guide you. I hope to see you soon, my sweet.

Your Stella.

(A longer pause)

(Sighing softly) You really do look so sweet, my little angel. Tucked away under the blankets, so blissfully unaware.

*(SFX: Heels approaching)*

I’d get into bed with you, but I just finished dressing up. (Pouting) It’s such a shame.

(Kissing listener’s forehead)

(Softly) I....I appreciate you, Snowflake. I do so much more than that. But I just can’t seem to tell you while you’re awake. (Whispering) I just can’t.

I wish I had met you earlier. Under better circumstances. Teenage me- Stella- she’d have loved you. (Amused) Well, granted, I may have bullied you a bit if we were at the royal academy together, but I....I’d have loved you just the same.

(A longer pause)

(Barely audible) I love you, Snowflake.

I’m afraid if I speak any louder, the winds outside will hear me. My words will be frozen in the ice hanging over the window ledge. And I don’t want that. I’m....I’m afraid they will tell you, and then you will hate me. Because I have no right to say these words to you after everything I’ve done. But even so, even then, I-

I love you.

(Pecking his cheek)

Your face is twitching, my pet. What is it? Do you miss your Mistress already? Do you miss her touch, her scent, her hair tickling your cheek?

Poor thing. Fine, then. You can have my scarf. Here, I’ll wrap it around your neck.

(SFX: Very soft brushing of fabric)

I wore this yesterday evening when I went for a walk in the snow. It still smells of me. That faint, lingering blend of rose and sandalwood which you’ve grown to like. I think.

You can also wear my cap. I have no need for this tonight. The partners of a few of the young army officers will sometimes wear their military caps, for safe keeping. It’s both a symbol of belonging, and....and romance, oddly enough.

(Kissing his forehead once more)

There. Now this little kiss on your forehead will stay safe under my cap, and she’ll keep you company until you wake up. (Brief, girlish giggling)

I hope to see you soon, Snowflake.

*(SFX: Heels walking away, slowly fading out)*

......

*(SFX: Faint notes of music, of cellos and piano. Hushed conversations, clinking of wine glasses.)*

(Sipping her wine) Who’s that girl dancing with Easton over there?

Really? Damn. I had no idea he was such a player.

I’m sure you’d know, Emmary. You know all the gossip. But what about you? Don’t tell me you came alone to this party.

No! No, come on! It can’t be!

Alright, spill. I’m sure you’ve got your sweetheart tucked away somewhere waiting for you. Like in the cellar downstairs, perhaps.

(Scoffing) Oh, that is- that is *so* not fair! I have never once locked my snowflake down in a cellar or dungeon or any subterranean space. He would....he would get claustrophobic. Probably.

Oh, he is going to arrive a little later. I thought he might want some time to....process things, now that the war has all but reached its conclusion.

(Smiling ever so slowly) I like to think so, Em. I really do like to think I care for him.

That’s nice of you to say. Thank you. But really, I’m the lucky one.

Yeah. Being with my pet- I mean, with Snowflake- it just calms me, you know? I feel anchored to something I thought I had cast aside long ago. He reminds me of....of home.

His eyes still burn, but I can’t see anger or resentment behind them like I did months ago. Now, they just remind me of a campfire in the dead of winter.

It’s difficult to put into words, Em. I can’t remember ever feeling this way. It’s like....I used to live in a warm little log cabin a very long time ago. But I had to go outside in the snow one day, and then I lost my way. I’ve been walking inside a snowstorm ever since then. The storm doesn’t hurt me, but it seems to destroy everything around me that I touch. I’ve grown cold, and numb from the cold.

But now, the lights behind my old cabin window are visible again. My skin can feel the warmth of the hearth fire. My eyes can see the dancing flames. And my heart....I can feel it beating with hope for the first time in years. Fast, and loud, and almost painful, but I want to keep feeling whatever this is. This little flame of hope inside me- and all the pain that it brings- I don’t want it to go away. It reminds me I’m still alive. That I can still feel. (Fervent) I want to- Emmary, I don’t want my heart to freeze again.

(A longer pause)

I’m sorry. This is so shameful of me, but I- I appreciate you being here. Still, you should probably attend to your darling in the cellar now.

(Genuinely surprised) He can wait....? Hang on a minute, I was saying that in jest. You- you actually have someone down there?

I....um, no, I’ve not asked my snowflake yet.

Yes. I will. Tonight. I brought this with me, after all.

(Smiling faintly) I think it looks beautiful as well. It’ll look even more beautiful around my pet’s finger. These blue ice diamonds on a band of silver- they seem to be glowing with their own pale luminescence here in the shadow of the estate. Do you think he will like it?

Do you think he will wear it? Will he wear it for me?

(Smiling) I hope you’re right, Emmary. I really do.

But enough of this. (Sipping down the rest of her wine) I won’t keep you any longer from....whoever you’ve got down in the cellar. And no, I didn’t hear anything. Have fun, my friend.

*(SFX: Heels walking away. No dialogue. The music and conversations grow fainter and fainter, nearly disappearing.)*

*(Finally, she stops walking)*

You’re glowing ever so brightly, little diamonds. I wove my magic into you, but I didn’t think you’d respond to my emotions.

Yes. I miss him too. But he will be here. You’ll see.

(Sighing) Look at me. Talking in the dark to an engagement ring. But oh well, it’s like they say- diamonds are a girl’s best friend.

Don’t worry, little diamonds. You won’t melt even if you’re made from frost. On the contrary, you’ll seek warmth just like me. Because you’re a part of me.

You’ll seek warmth from my dear snowflake, just like I do. Did you know I made him sleep in my bed every night for months just because I felt cold?

Of course I couldn’t admit it to him! I’m the ice queen of Eluria. Me, feeling cold? He’d never let me hear the end of it!

Technically he’s still my prisoner, you know? He has no right to tease me. But I....I really do let him get away with a lot, you know?

(Pouting) Only because he’s cute.

(Eyes widening ever so slowly) Only because I love him.

Sometimes, I wonder which one of us is really the prisoner.

You’ll love being on my darling’s finger. You’ll love his warmth. And I know you’ll protect him when I’m not there. I....I know he will look at you when he’s alone, and smile in that soft, annoying way of his, and know he is loved. Because you’ll remind him of me. Our eyes share the same colour, after all. And both of us love Snowflake.

(A longer pause)

 Snowflake....?

(Happy, cheerful) You came! Oh, you sure took your time, didn’t you? Just like always.

What are you doing? Come here. Give me a hug!

(Content little noises) It’s good to see you. Did you have any trouble finding this place?

Well then, I guess your navigational skills have improved huh?

Oh, I’m totally taking credit. So, um....what would you like to drink? I know you’re not drinking alcohol, so I had them prepare some softer drinks. There’s fruit juice, and cold coffee, and hot chocolate and-

Oh? You’re not thirsty? Are you sure?

Oh. Okay. Maybe later then. You, uh- you’re looking really nice.

(Sultrier) Look at you, all dressed up like a doll. A very suave and dashing boy doll, before you say anything. Because I know you were itching to speak up in protest just now.

See? I know you so well!

(Kissing the listener, before he pulls away)

Snowflake?

(Taken aback) I’m sorry. Did I startle you? I wasn’t trying to- you know-

Okay. If you say so. I....can I kiss you again, then?

Pet....?

What is it? What’s wrong? You’re- you’re not in pain, are you? Was I holding you too tightly just now?

But you- you look a little unwell, sweetheart. Are you feeling sick? Should we go inside? I can have our best physicians take a look if-

Oh. Well, then....what is it, my darling?

Of course. (Brightening up) Oh yes, the war is over! And I’m so happy with all the work you’ve done. Your alchemy was instrumental in bringing this to a swift end. I cannot overstate your contributions enough.

Some heroes don’t fight on the frontlines, my dear. I will absolutely not tolerate you underplaying your achievements, do you hear me?

Good. Now, stand up straight please.

You heard me. It’s just us out here, but there are some traditions that must be upheld. Your shoulders are slumped like a pine tree under snow. (Sharp, assertive) Hey, pet, chin up. Now.

Good boy.

Well, I think you know what this is. I’m sorry for having to pull this from within the folds of my dress- this is usually *not* how these things are awarded in our military, I swear- but I wasn’t going to lug around a velvet box all evening, you know?

It’s a medallion, silly. Order of the Effulgent Cross. The second highest distinction awarded by the State to civilians. For acts of extraordinary resilience and heroism.

I wanted to award you the highest distinction, honestly- you deserve it- but some paper-pushers in parliament were less than thrilled. And only because you’re a foreigner in our nation. (Muttering) Good-for-nothing racists.

Hm? I’m sorry, I’m not sure I heard you correctly.

What do you mean you can’t accept it? I pinned it to your suit. The government recognises you as a hero. Would seeing the stamped papers convince you?

You deserve it. I know it’s just a medallion, but it carries weight. And it has meaning. It’s a symbol of all your contributions towards establishing peace, darling.

Excuse me?

(Taking a deep breath) No. That’s just- no. You’re wrong. You couldn’t be more wrong.

(Soft indignation) It’s not the weight of all the lives you’ve taken. It’s the weight of all the lives you’ve saved. You know what the death toll would’ve been if I couldn’t get high-grade Artemisium. You’ve not only prevented the deaths of innocents, but you’ve also saved so many of my soldiers from dying in battle. (Firm, emphatic) That....that is an act of true difference.

You’re a hero, Snowflake, even if it’s not in the way you might have imagined when you joined the rebels. (Softly) You’re my hero. You really are. And you’ve saved me too.

There’s....(a little too quickly) there’s something I really want to tell you.

Huh....? You- you too?

(Awkward but happy laughter) Of course, my dear. You first.

No, go ahead. I insist.

(A longer pause)

Oh? You have a request of me?

Oh, pet. Why do you hesitate? Ask me what you want, and it’s yours.

I’m pretty sure I can accommodate any request you make of me, dear. Don’t be shy. If it’s something....intimate, then I won’t judge you either. Not much, anyway (laughing).

Just ask, my pet.

(A longer pause)

(Smiling) You wish to go? Go where? Go dancing? I know it’s the Armistice Ball, but I *really* didn’t expect you’d want to dance with me. (Pretending to swoon) Oh, *Snowflake*!

Hey hey, I’m only teasing! Oh, always so *serious*. What’s with the sad look, dearest? I don’t care if we dance or not, as long as we’re together.

(Vaguely concerned) Hey. Are you alright?

Snowflake. Look at me.

(Still smiling) You were saying you wanted to go somewhere. Did you mean, like, a vacation?

You’re quiet. Are you shy about asking me to go on a holiday with you? Really? Even *now*?

That’s not it? Well then, where would you like to go? The hills, the sea? Just exploring the capital city? Oooh, or maybe you want to go vacationing on the pristine white beaches of Fjordshire! (Sighing wistfully) That sounds really nice, actually. And the island just got liberated too.

(Somewhat deflated) Oh. So that’s not what you had in mind. (Mildly frustrated) What is it then? Where do you want us to go?

You want to go....alone?

I don’t understand. Go where?

Go back? But....I don’t understand. Go back to....to what?

Snowflake?

I can’t understand what you’re saying. If there’s somewhere you want to go, I’m happy to let you. But if it’s dangerous, then I will go with you. That is not negotiable.

I’m sorry?

(Soft, quiet, still) You want to.....get away from me?

(A longer pause)

But my darling, why- why do you want to do that? Did I hurt you somehow?

Then did I say something I shouldn’t have? I’m sorry. You know how I get sometimes. But it’s only because I’ve never had to filter my words when talking with you.

No....? Then why would you say that?

Snowflake. Sweetheart. I’m really trying to understand here. If- if you need some space- some time to yourself- then I can do that. I can- I-

(Another long pause)

Leave?

You.....wish to leave?

(Faintly) Yes....the war has ended.

(Fainter) Yes....I said I’d let you go after the war was over.

You want to leave me?

(Echoing back) Oh. You just want to be free.

(Not really listening) Yeah. You’ve certainly earned that.

Yeah.

You....want to leave me.

If it’s not that, (lashing out) then what is it?! What do you want from me? Answer me!

(Shallow, ragged breaths)

(Very quietly) You think I don’t know?

You think I don’t know about you visiting the dungeons every night? To see Ameera, your old friend?

Don’t talk to me about breaking a promise, when you yourself can’t keep one.

I spared her life. On the condition that she would be out of yours. You were supposed to forget about her. You were supposed to.....(heartbroken, barely audible) to be mine.

You’re not leaving. I....I won’t let you leave.

Because I still want you. Not your alchemy, just....you. (Whispering) I want you to stay.

(Taking a deep breath) Please. Just stay. Just take my hand.

(Pleading) Snowflake. Don’t go. Please, just take my hand. Let me....let me make everything better, just like you did for me.

Snowflake.....

(Quietly) You won’t stay, will you?

(A long pause)

You don’t love me.

(Almost to herself) There’s still a fire in your eyes. But it doesn’t bring me comfort or solace. It’s not warm. It’s....burning.

You still hate me. You don’t care about me. You....you never did.

Nothing of what we did together ever meant anything to you, did it?

*(Slapping him. Hard.)*

(Unsteady breathing. The seconds trickle by.)

I won’t let you go. You are still a prisoner. You’re not free.

Trying so hard to pull free from my grasp. Like you’re suffocating. It’s not you that’s suffocating. It’s not you that’s in pain. It’s not you whose lungs are burning up. It’s not you.

You know, darling....I can see the anger in your eyes. But that’s not it. What really dominates your face right now.....(whispering) is fear.

Why’s that? You told Stella you weren’t afraid of me. Did you lie to Stella? Did you lie to me?

You shouldn’t have.

*(SFX: Blunt impact. Glass shattering to pieces.)*

I don’t blame you though. Not for fearing me. Because you see....(whispering) you *should* be afraid of me.

*(Striking him)* You- *(thud)* \- ungrateful- *(thud)*\- lying- *(slap)*\- piece of- *(slap)*\- *shit. (Throwing him against a metal grate. Hard.)*

(Rapid, shallow breathing, like she’s the one in agony)

Don’t ever forget your place. We are done when I say we are done. *Slave*.

*(Spitting on him)*

(Aloof, matter-of-fact) You look pathetic. But I suppose you always were. I just decided to ignore that about you.

Enjoy the rest of your night, Snowflake. Away from me. Guess you got your wish after all, huh?

*(SFX: Heels walking away. Stepping on him briefly.)*

*(SFX: Walking turns into running)*

(Thunderous echo of heels running. Troubled breathing, as if struggling not to cry.)

..

...

.....

*(Heels stop.)*

(Crying silently. Strained breathing. No words for several seconds.)

(Deep, calming breaths. Trying to return to normal- but never quite getting there)

(In a hoarse, cracked voice) Who’s there?

(A longer pause)

Emmary....? Is- is that you?

I’m fine. (Forcing a neutral tone- partially succeeding) I’m fine. Sorry to- uh, what are you doing here?

Oh.

Yes. I saw my- I saw Snowflake. Just a little while ago.

(Blank) Huh....? Excuse me?

The ring?

No, I....I did not give him the ring yet.

(Softly, almost to herself) Because I didn’t get the chance.

I’m alright. Really.

Em?

Why can’t I die?

Over a hundred battles. Years of warfare. Leading my soldiers into the fray. Fighting my enemies head on. Why haven’t I died yet? Why have I not suffered a single fatal wound yet?

Because I’m strong....?

(Whispering, lost) I’m not strong. I’m just cruel. A demon surrounded by a snowstorm. It’s the storm, Em. It’s the storm!

The storm is destroying everything I touch. Again. It’s a part of me. I can’t be free of the storm. I cannot.

I’m not alright, Em.

(A longer pause)

I hurt him. Because I can’t stand the thought of him not being with me. I just can’t. I don’t know why. But I....I need him. I *need* him.

I hurt him just to keep him with me. I’m so sorry, Snowflake. I’m so sorry, Stella. I’m sorry.

But it’s alright, you know? He- he won’t ever think of leaving again. Because he knows what I’ll do if he tries.

I love him. I love him enough, to hurt him. I love him so much, I’m okay with him being afraid of me. (To herself) Yes. That’s just fine. Fear is a great motivator to not do silly things. Like running. Like leaving. Yes.

This is just fine, Emmary. I don’t care if it’s fear that keeps him. Whether it keeps him as my husband or as my footstool. As long as he’s mine, I- I will be happy. I will love him with everything I have.

This....this is just fine....right?

1lgevfx,https://i.redd.it/q5nyhoejb58f1.png,"I decided to build yet another macro tracking app. Meet - Nunch, the simplest, most delightful way to track your calories and macros.","Hi everyone!

I know, I know, most of you are going to say - another macro tracker app?

I've been wanting an app like this for myself since I started tracking macros some 10 years ago. I've been going to the gym and doing weight building even longer. I like to eat and the only way to keep an eye on the weight is to keep track on my calories, as much as I can anyway. And trying to eat healthy. 

Tracking calories and logging food everyday is a bit tedious process and there's no way around that, unfortunately. And my app is probably not going to make that process any easier. However, I got tired of other apps with large polluted databases offering wide range of calories on identical foods and just generally being hard to navigate and cluttered with features I didn't need. Most of them lost me on their 56th onboarding page... And then asking for a login...

This is my first deep-dive into indie development and my first released app. I've designed and developed the app over the past year by myself and I even decided to create the app icon. I hope you give it a try and I'm always open for any feedback.

1lgetr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFinanceTrending/comments/1lgetr3/5_smarter_budgeting_alternatives_to_the_503020/,5 Smarter Budgeting Alternatives to the 50/30/20 Rule That Actually Work in 2025,"**The Budgeting Rule Everyone Knows… But No One Can Actually Afford Anymore**

There was a time when the 50/30/20 rule felt like the golden ratio of personal finance. Save 20%, spend 30% on wants, and keep 50% for needs? Done. Easy. Balanced. You’d see it on Pinterest infographics, financial TikToks, and even buried in your bank’s app settings.

But that was *then*.

Now, you’re paying $1,700 for a one-bedroom, grocery prices jumped 25% in two years, and your 'wants' category is being eaten alive by Uber rides and prescription copays. The math doesn’t math anymore. For Gen Z and Millennials, especially in big cities or with freelance income, the 50/30/20 rule is like trying to fit your 2025 life into a 2005 spreadsheet.

Let’s break down why this rule, once beloved, no longer fits real people’s real money-and what smarter alternatives actually work today.

# Why the 50/30/20 Rule No Longer Fits Most People’s Real Finances

**What is the 50/30/20 Rule and Why Was It Popular?**

Originally made famous by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her book *All Your Worth* (Chapter 3), the 50/30/20 rule was designed as a simple framework:

* 50% of your income goes to needs (rent, food, bills)
* 30% goes to wants (streaming, travel, nights out)
* 20% goes to savings or debt payoff

It felt intuitive, clean, and empowering-especially for people just starting out. It told you, 'Hey, you can enjoy your money and still be responsible.' And for a while, that balance actually worked.

But it’s built on one very fragile assumption: **that your needs won’t consume more than half your paycheck.**

Which brings us to the problem.

**Why It Fails in 2025: Inflation, Rent Spikes, and Income Instability**

Fast forward to today. The cost of living has sprinted ahead of wage growth, and side hustles aren’t always a solution-they’re often just survival mode with extra steps.

* **Average rent for a 1-bedroom in the U.S.: $1,768** (Zillow Rental Report, May 2025)
* **Inflation for groceries: up 24.3% since 2022** (Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 2025)
* **Electricity bills? Up 15.7% YoY.**
* **Median wage growth: 4.1% in the same period.**

So when half your income is supposed to cover 'needs,' but your *rent alone* eats 45%? Yeah. The 50/30/20 rule doesn’t hold up.

And if you have a variable income-gig work, creator economy, freelance, contract-you can’t cleanly slice your pay into fixed ratios every month. One viral TikTok doesn’t mean your next check comes on time.

**Who Still Benefits from 50/30/20-and Who Absolutely Doesn’t**

Let’s be real: not all budgets are broken. If you’re a dual-income household with relatively low fixed expenses, you might still hit those 50/30/20 marks.

This rule can work for:

* Couples with combined six-figure incomes
* People in low-cost-of-living areas
* Anyone without student loans, dependents, or erratic income

But it fails *hard* for:

* Renters in major metros (NYC, SF, LA)
* Single earners with dependents
* Creators or freelancers with up-and-down pay
* People who are rebuilding credit or digging out of debt

**Real Data: How Today’s Cost of Living Breaks Traditional Budgeting**

According to the latest **Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey (2025 Q1)**:

* The **average U.S. household now spends 56% of its income on 'needs'** (housing, transportation, food).
* That’s 6% *above* the max in the 50/30/20 rule-**before wants or savings are even included**.
* **Only 11% of Millennials and Gen Z report sticking to the 50/30/20 structure**, per a 2025 Pew Research poll.

These aren’t edge cases. These are the new majority. If you’ve been feeling like you’re 'failing' at budgeting-it’s not you. It’s the rule that’s outdated.

**Insight from the experts:** In *Die With Zero* by Bill Perkins (Chapter 2), the author argues that traditional budgeting fails to adapt to modern life’s financial rhythm-and instead of blindly following rules, we should design spending around our personal goals and *actual* lifestyle constraints.

# Budgeting Rule Alternatives That Outperform 50/30/20

**70/20/10 Rule – Ideal for Aggressive Debt Payoff and Low Earners**

This one flips the usual priorities:

* 70% for needs and wants
* 20% for savings or emergency fund
* 10% directly to debt (especially high-interest)

Why it works in 2025: When your income is limited-or your rent just swallows 40%+ of your paycheck-traditional savings goals can feel like a fantasy. This method keeps spending flexible but locks in a consistent chunk toward debt, which is **key if you’re juggling credit cards, BNPL, or student loans**.

Think of it as: survive first, stabilize next, and then kill the debt slowly and systematically.

**Real Reddit use case:** A thread on r/povertyfinance with over 3.2K upvotes shares how one user crushed $11,400 in debt in 14 months on a $38K salary using this exact split.

**Best for:**

* Anyone with sub-$50K income
* People prioritizing credit score repair
* Households in debt recovery mode

**60/20/20 Rule – Best for Single-Income Households with Rising Expenses**

This split-60% needs, 20% wants, 20% savings/debt-is trending for people who need more cushion for essentials but still want to build financial momentum.

Why it works: Most U.S. households are now single-income or depend on one unstable paycheck (thanks, contract gigs and layoffs). This rule accepts that *needs are growing*, not shrinking, and still helps you carve out space for both sanity and future you.

Personal moment: When I went full freelance in 2023, my health insurance premiums tripled and my rent jumped mid-lease. I had to ditch 50/30/20 fast. I used the 60/20/20 rule to build a 3-month emergency fund and still budget weekly coffee runs so I didn’t lose my mind.

**Best for:**

* Parents with one working partner
* Anyone dealing with medical costs
* Freelancers on ACA insurance plans

**Supporting stat:** According to Pew (March 2025), 42% of U.S. households are now single-income. Of those, **74% say they’ve changed their budgeting method in the last 12 months**.

**Zero-Based Budgeting – Track Every Dollar with Maximum Control**

This is the go-to method for budgeting maximalists. With zero-based budgeting (ZBB), you assign a job to every single dollar of your income until there’s zero left unaccounted for.

That doesn’t mean you spend every dollar-it means every dollar is *told where to go*, whether that’s rent, savings, groceries, or your 'impulse fund' for late-night Amazon therapy.

Why it works in 2025: Prices are unpredictable. Income is unpredictable. ZBB helps you stay calm because you’ve already given every dollar a plan-even if you’re living lean.

**Tool tip:** YNAB (You Need A Budget) is built around this principle and has over 7,400 upvotes in recent Reddit threads on r/PersonalFinance. It syncs with your bank and makes ZBB more automatic.

**Best for:**

* ADHD or neurodivergent budgeters who crave structure
* Gig workers with irregular paychecks
* Couples managing joint accounts

**The Anti-Budget – Perfect for People Who Hate Budgeting (Reddit Favorite)**

Here’s the rebellious cousin of budgeting. The anti-budget says:

* Set aside your savings first (10–30%)
* Spend the rest however you want

No tracking. No spreadsheets. No Sunday-night guilt.

Why it works: Not everyone thrives on financial micromanagement. If you’ve got a stable income and decent self-control, this minimalist approach frees you from budgeting burnout.

**Real-world example:** A viral post on r/simpleliving (2025, 8.2K upvotes) laid out how a user automates a 25% transfer to savings every payday and never thinks about budgeting again. 'I’ve never budgeted. I just don’t touch what I save.'

**Best for:**

* High earners with simple expenses
* Burned-out budgeters
* Anyone who wants 'vibes-based' spending with some safety built in

**The 80/20 Rule – Simplified Saving for High Earners with No Time**

Based on the Pareto Principle, this method is **hyper-simple**:

* 20% to savings/investing
* 80% for everything else

Why it works in 2025: High-income earners often *don’t have time* for line-by-line tracking-but they can afford to frontload savings and let the rest flow. This rule puts wealth-building on autopilot.

If you earn $8K/month and immediately save $1,600 (401(k), Roth, HSA, brokerage)-you’re winning. And you don’t need to justify your sushi runs or ski trip.

**Expert tip:** Use auto-transfers or tools like Monarch Money to route your 20% before you ever see it. 'Out of sight, out of spend.'

**Best for:**

* Tech professionals, consultants, healthcare workers
* Anyone whose time is more valuable than a detailed budget
* People trying to scale investments passively

**Insight from a book:** In *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel (Chapter 13), Housel emphasizes that simple, automated systems beat complicated plans you don’t stick to. The 80/20 rule thrives because it’s frictionless and scalable.

# How to Choose the Right Budgeting Method Based on Your Life Situation

**What’s the Best Budgeting Method If I Have Irregular Income?**

This is one of the most searched budgeting questions in 2025-and for good reason. Whether you're freelancing, creating content, driving for Uber, or juggling multiple side gigs, inconsistent paychecks break traditional rules fast.

Here’s the strategy that’s actually working: **Start with a base budget built on your 'worst-case' monthly income.** This is your lowest-earning month in the last 6–12 months.

Then, when you earn *more*, you don’t expand your spending-you feed your buffer fund, cover quarterly taxes, or hit savings goals.

Tools that help:

* **You Need A Budget (YNAB)** – its Rule One literally starts with: 'Give every dollar a job'
* **Copilot** – syncs with bank accounts and auto-categorizes by project or client

Reddit wisdom: A top comment on r/freelancefinance (4.9K upvotes) says: 'Budget your lifestyle based on your worst month. That way, every good month feels like a bonus-not a trap.'

**Best method match:**

* Zero-Based Budgeting or
* 60/20/20 with a monthly buffer built in

**Best Budgeting Rule for People Living Paycheck-to-Paycheck**

If you're counting the days to payday and watching your checking account sweat every Sunday night, the goal isn’t perfection-it’s control.

What works best:

* **70/20/10**: This rule prioritizes survival while still pushing debt payments
* **Zero-Based Budgeting**: Tracks every dollar, which helps plug spending leaks fast

Why this matters: According to Bankrate’s 2025 survey, **58% of Gen Z and 46% of Millennials say they live paycheck-to-paycheck**, even with full-time work. Budgeting isn't about saving 20% when you can barely cover rent-it's about regaining *any* sense of control.

Quick personal truth: After a contract fell through in 2024, I lived off two freelance invoices that paid 40 days late. Zero-based budgeting helped me avoid overdrafts-not because I had more money, but because I knew exactly *where* it was going.

**Tool tip:** Use apps like Monarch or Goodbudget to visually bucket your bills vs. flexible spend. Seeing it *on screen* is way less stressful than trying to remember what cleared.

**High-Income Earners: Why Traditional Rules May Leave You Under-Saving**

If you're making $100K+ and still feel broke, you're not alone. Lifestyle creep, high housing costs, and 'quiet luxury' pressure make saving tricky-even when you technically can.

What works:

* **The 80/20 Rule** – because automation beats willpower
* **The Anti-Budget** – if you prefer simplicity with savings baked in

Why you might still be stuck: Many high earners follow 50/30/20 and think they’re doing fine-**but 20% of post-tax income might not cut it for early retirement, down payments, or career breaks**.

Insight from Reddit: r/FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) is full of high-income threads like: 'Why I ditched 50/30/20 after hitting $200K/year.' They argue for saving *30–50%* during peak earning years to fast-track freedom.

**Best approach:** Reverse-engineer your savings goals, then automate that number up front. Use the 80/20 or anti-budget to keep the rest hands-off.

**What Budgeting Rules Are Redditors Actually Using in 2025?**

Let’s be real: if you want budgeting advice that’s been field-tested by thousands of real people-not just money gurus or finance bros-Reddit’s where you go.

Most common takeaways from top threads on r/PersonalFinance and r/Budget:

* **Zero-Based Budgeting gets the most love** (especially when paired with YNAB)
* **Anti-budget is rising fast**\-especially among neurodivergent users
* **Sub-savings accounts (nicknamed 'digital envelopes') are making a comeback**
* **Custom hybrids beat strict rules**\-many users mix 70/20/10 + envelope systems + automation

Example from Reddit (2025): A post titled 'How I built a recession-proof budget on $55K with ADHD' hit 6.2K upvotes. The user blended 60/20/20 with digital envelopes and called it 'low-brain budgeting.'

**Bottom line:** Your budget doesn’t need to follow a perfect rule-it just needs to *work for your brain and your life*. The only wrong budget is the one you abandon.

**Book insight:** In *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (Chapter 4), he writes: 'You don’t rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.' Budgeting isn’t about willpower-it’s about building a system you’ll actually use on a tired Tuesday night.

# Reddit-Proven Budgeting Hacks That Work in Real Life

**'Set It and Forget It' Automation Strategies That Scale**

If you don’t automate your finances in 2025, you’re working twice as hard for half the results.

Here’s what actually works:

* **Auto-transfer savings on payday**, not the end of the month (because let’s be honest, nothing’s left by then)
* **Auto-pay minimums on debt** to avoid fees, then do manual top-ups if cash allows
* **Automate investment contributions** (401(k), Roth IRA, or brokerage) right after your paycheck hits

Why it works: It removes the emotional friction of saving. You don’t have to *choose* to do the responsible thing every time-you do it once, then let the system run.

Reddit proof: A user on r/PersonalFinance posted 'Automated my paycheck to split into 4 buckets. Net worth up $36K in 18 months' and pulled 9.7K upvotes. Their split?

* 40% checking
* 20% Roth IRA
* 20% HYS account
* 20% bills sub-account

Best apps for this:

* **Monarch** (clean UI + goal-based automation)
* **Albert** (auto-saves based on spending patterns)
* **Fidelity** and **Vanguard** (auto-invest from your bank)

**Key insight:** You don’t need motivation-you need default settings that *do the right thing* when you’re tired, distracted, or overwhelmed.

**Envelope System for Cash Flow Control (2025 Digital-First Version)**

The old-school envelope system meant putting literal cash in envelopes marked 'Rent,' 'Groceries,' 'Fun,' etc. When the envelope was empty, you were done spending. It worked because it was visual, tactile, and immediate.

Now? We don’t use cash. But the principle still slaps.

How to do it in 2025:

* Use **digital envelopes** with sub-accounts in banks like Ally, Capital One, or SoFi
* Label your buckets: Rent, Food, Self-care, Travel, Unexpected
* Move money into each on payday, then track balances before spending

Why it works: You’re no longer guessing what’s 'safe' to spend in your checking account. You know your travel fund is $143.07-not 'probably enough.'

Reddit use case: On r/Budget, a user posted: 'Digital envelopes saved my marriage.' They split household income into six buckets and haven’t argued about money in over a year. Thread has 5.6K upvotes and dozens of copycats.

Best banks for this:

* **SoFi** (lets you name and automate multiple vaults)
* **Ally** (up to 30 savings buckets with goals)
* **Monzo/Chime** if you want mobile-first

**Sub-Savings Accounts: The Most Underrated Tactic on r/PersonalFinance**

Sub-savings accounts-or savings 'buckets'-are the quiet MVP of budget structure. They’re simple to set up, easy to manage, and make money feel real again.

Top buckets people use:

* 'Next Rent'
* 'Car Repair Emergency'
* 'BFF’s Wedding'
* 'Impulse Protection' (for guilt-free splurges)

Why it works: Psychologically, seeing a line that says 'Vacation Fund: $602' makes you way less likely to dip into it for random online shopping. It turns vague intentions into visible money.

Reddit-approved combo: Use a **60/20/20 budget** and split your 20% savings across 3–5 labeled sub-savings goals. A comment with 2.2K upvotes: 'Started sub-saving $20/month for Christmas in February. Didn’t stress once in December.'

Recommended tools:

* **Capital One 360** – lets you nickname and automate sub-savings
* **Qapital** – adds rules like 'round up purchases' to send spare change to goals
* **Monarch or YNAB** – great for goal tracking + budget integration

**Budgeting Apps Redditors Swear By (YNAB, Monarch, Copilot, etc.)**

# FAQ: Real Answers to Budgeting’s Most Annoying Questions

**'Can I even budget if I make under $2,000/month?'**

Short answer: Yes. But not with the rules most finance influencers post on Instagram.

Here’s the truth: budgeting on a low income isn’t about perfection. It’s about **choosing visibility over shame**. The goal isn’t to save 20%-it’s to know where your money is going *before* it disappears.

What works:

* **Zero-Based Budgeting** – because it forces intentionality, not idealism
* **70/20/10 Rule** – lower savings ask, but keeps debt in check
* **Envelope or sub-savings hacks** – even if it’s $10 at a time

Real example: On r/povertyfinance, one user shared their $1,700/month income breakdown-splitting rent, groceries, and meds with surgical precision. They used **Capital One’s sub-accounts** and literally named one 'Please No Overdraft.'

Reminder: **Budgeting isn't a reward for being rich.** It's how people survive being broke.

# 'How do I budget when I keep getting surprise expenses?'

Surprise expenses aren’t the exception-they *are* the rule.

The fix: build **an 'Oh Sh\*t Fund'** into your actual budget, not as a bonus savings goal. Think $50–$100/month minimum, even if that means cutting from wants.

Where to stash it:

* A high-yield savings account (HYSA) labeled 'Oops'
* A digital envelope named 'Life Happens'
* A prepaid debit card (like the old-school envelope feel)

Reddit tip: r/Budget has a pinned thread titled 'Your emergency fund should start at $500, not $5K,' with over 4.3K upvotes. The idea is: **small wins build momentum**, and you’ll never save five grand if you don’t first save $50.

Tool that helps: **Qapital** – it rounds up purchases to fund your 'surprise' envelope without effort.

# 'Is it bad that I don’t track every dollar?'

Nope. Not at all. Some brains hate spreadsheets, and that’s normal.

You don’t have to track *everything*\-but you do need a system that makes sure your **priorities get money before your temptations do**.

Try:

* The **Anti-Budget**: Save first, spend the rest
* **Monarch or Copilot**: Passive tracking that updates in the background
* A weekly 10-minute money check-in (not daily stress)

As Ramit Sethi says in *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* (Chapter 5): 'You don’t need to be a spreadsheet ninja to be rich-you just need to set up a system once and let it run.' You win with consistency, not obsession.

# 'What if I budget, but still feel broke all the time?'

This one hits deep. Because sometimes you *are* budgeting. You’re doing everything 'right.' And yet it feels like you’re just... treading water.

Here’s what that usually means:

* Your **income is too low to support your actual fixed costs**, not your lifestyle
* You’re using a budgeting method that assumes more flexibility than you have
* You’re not accounting for emotional spending triggers (loneliness, stress, ADHD burnout)

Budgeting can’t fix a wage that’s too low for your zip code. But it *can* help you name the problem, spot patterns, and make changes based on facts-not just vibes.

Real tactic: Build a 'non-negotiables' list-things you *refuse* to cut (therapy, pet food, gym)-and budget around those first. That brings sanity back into the process.

Then look at the numbers:

* Can you renegotiate bills?
* Can you get on a student loan IDR plan?
* Can you add $100/week with part-time or freelance work?

None of it is easy. But clarity is a form of power.

# 'Can I budget if I have ADHD?'

Yes. In fact, you *must* budget-just differently.

What works:

* **The Anti-Budget** – automate savings and ignore the rest
* **Digital envelopes** – clear categories, visual separation
* **YNAB** – if you love structure and dopamine check-ins
* **Monarch or Copilot** – low friction, mobile-first, passive tracking

Reddit love: r/ADHD has dozens of threads like 'Budgeting that doesn’t make me cry?' One user: 'I set my bills to autopay, savings to auto-transfer, and only check my account once a week. Life-changing.' (5.1K upvotes)

Small tweaks matter:

* Use reminders
* Celebrate tiny wins
* Avoid shame-based goals
* Budget for 'treats' so impulse spending doesn’t wreck you

Quote that sticks: From *Atomic Habits*, James Clear says: 'You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.' Your budget isn’t about control. It’s about support.

1lgelfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/capm/comments/1lgelfi/passed_study_techniques_and_testtaking_techniques/,Passed! Study techniques AND Test-taking techniques,"I passed the CAPM today! Here's another ""what I did"" post AND I'll include some test-taking strategies that were helpful.

**Study Techniques**

Took the class offered by PMI last summer: **PMI® Authorized On-Demand Certified Associate in Project Management  (CAPM)® Exam Prep Course**; finished in July of 2024. I wasn't super impressed by the delivery of this course (the EVA stuff was messed up and I was really confused - they had some of the wrong formulas on certain slides, and some of the slides were obviously out of order). I did take COPIOUS hand-written notes on all nine modules.

I went ahead and applied to take the exam, but didn't get to it prior to the start of the school year (I was a teacher). I used PocketPrep for review after finishing the class. Fast forward to beginning of June, 2025. I scheduled my exam for June 20 and bought the **PMI Study Hall for CAPM** on June 10. You get access for three months for $49. I entered my target test day and started working through the ""Learning Plan"". It tracks your progress overall (% complete) and tells you how many learning points you need each day to be ready by test day. You earn learning points by reviewing sections in the four domains. I worked through the practice questions for each domain, as well, and once I saw which domains I was weak in, I put more emphasis there.

A couple of days ago, I took the three mini-practice exams (10 questions each) and then yesterday I took the 150-question practice exam. One of the things I liked was that it showed me where my weaknesses were once I had answered enough questions in that domain. The photos below shows where I was in the Study Hall when I took the test this morning. I don't have the test results back yet to tell me if I was T (target) or AT (above target) in each domain, but I did get the ""Congratulations"" message at the end. It will be interesting to compare what is in the photo from Study Hall to my actual results on the test. (I'll update when I get the results!)

https://preview.redd.it/1gx9mi1f558f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e67273e30b329680b07f08982d5adba7b8a76b4

My average score on all practice questions was 75% and my average score on the practice exams was 81%.

Overall, I probably spent 10 hours reviewing in the last two weeks and then two hours taking the practice exam yesterday.

**Test-Taking Strategies**

I read each question carefully and highlighted any pertinent information in the question. If I knew the answer immediately, I selected it *AND THEN I HIGHLIGHTED THAT ANSWER*. This is helpful when you are reviewing your answer!

Then, I used the ~~strikethrough~~ tool to mark out any answers that were obviously wrong (you can usually pretty quickly eliminate two of them). If I could fairly confidently mark one of the two remaining choices, I would select it, then highlight it.

Notice I did not use the flag tool here.

If I was UNSURE about the answer, I would pick the one I thought was best, but I *wouldn't* highlight it.

I used the FLAG 🚩 tool only when I thought *maybe* there would be another question in the section that would help me with this particular question (""DSDM"" in particular). I only flagged questions that were related to other questions or that I *hoped* would be.

After I answered every question, I went back to the beginning to review. By highlighting the answers I was reasonable sure of, I was easily able to click ""next"" through those and get to the ones that I was unsure of. Flagging was great because it allowed me to find related questions fairly quickly. I only flagged about four questions in each half of the test.

I took about two hours on the entire exam. I do read quickly and I am pretty decisive. I don't like to change my answers after I have chosen one because I usually get them wrong when I change them. I took about a 7-minute break at the halfway point (my nerves and my coffee got the better of me!).

Hope this helps some of you out there! Best of luck!",5,1750452345.0,capm,0,0.86,False

1lgej91,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBudgetBrides/comments/1lgej91/40_guest_40k_wedding_in_worcester_ma/,"40 guest 40k wedding in Worcester, MA","Hi everyone, I don't fully identify as a ""big budget bride,"" but I appreciate the lack of judgment in this community, and I'm all for pricing transparency, especially in the wedding industry, so I want to share a budget breakdown of my recent wedding in hopes it can help others.

Total: \~40k for a 42 (including the couple) person wedding day in Worcester, MA

* 13k Catering: grazing boards, hors d'oeuvres, Salad course, choice of plated entree, mini desserts (we did not do cake) & coffee, Linens, plates, cutlery, glassware, etc, servers, upgraded chairs
* 8k Venue: Ceremony, Reception, Tables & Chairs, Art galleries open to guests, Sound system, Event Coordinator
* 6k Photography: Pre-wedding 1hr photoshoot, 7 hrs of wedding day coverage, digital gallery with high-res downloads
* 4.5k Bridal outfit: dress, alterations, accessories 
* 2k Live music: String quartet for ceremony and cocktail hour
* 2k Florals:  Ceremony decor, table centerpieces, floral card & bouquet, setup & cleanup, misc
* 2k Hair & Makeup package: Bridal hair & makeup + trial, 4 ""bridesmaid"" makeup, 6 ""bridesmaid"" hair
* 1k Alcohol: Hosted consumption bar (aka we paid for our guests per drink NOT per head), champagne pour during speeches
* $700 Hotel: 2 nights @ hotel
* $700 Partner's outfit: tux, shoes, shirt, bowtie
* $600 Stationery: save the dates, invitations, thank you cards, guest book, wedding day signage
* $300 misc ceremony items: Instax cameras & film, welcome table decor, binders, flameless candles, etc
* $200 Wedding bands
* $200 Gifts for our wedding party
* $0 We did NOT have: Wedding planner / day of coordinator, cake, content creator, videographer, DJ / Emcee

Things that were more expensive than planned:

* Catering: The venue has a restricted catering list, and our first choice caterer went out of business after we booked the venue, so we went with our second choice caterer, which was significantly more expensive, but thankfully ended up being well worth the money in terms of service & quality.
* Wedding dress alterations: I waited too long to schedule alterations and ended up paying more than planned for a seamstress in the Boston area (HCOL) to do rush alterations
* Stationery: We did all the stationery ourselves to save money, and every single print job added up. $50 Invitations here, $30 menus there, $100 welcome sign, etc. It wasn't a huge line item, but it cost more than expected and took time to design everything. Paying someone 1-1.5k for all the stationery would have been well worth it.

Things that were less expensive than planned:

* Alcohol: We had a hosted bar with low, mid, and high tier alcohol options for the entire event, and only paid 1k. Paying per drink really made a difference here since each guest averaged only 2 mid-tier drinks. This was much less than expected - most of our guests do drink socially, so we had estimated triple this number when budgeting. 
* Florals: the venue was so beautiful that we didn't feel like it needed much in terms of florals, but so many florists in our area have event minimums, especially on a Saturday in June. I did NOT want to do my own florals, so we were expecting to pay at least 6k to meet a vendor minimum. Thankfully, with some extra research & quite a few inquiries, I found a wonderful florist without an event minimum, willing to do our flowers for 2k. 
* Wedding bands: my partner and I both have beautiful engagement rings, but bought them without thinking about wedding bands. As such, neither ring stacks well. We were on the fence about getting wedding bands at all, but decided to get budget ones on Etsy and upgrade at a later point if we like wearing them. This saved us money in the short term, but was a huge mistake as we ended up doing a ring blessing ceremony, and now a ring that was recently blessed by all our family and friends has already lost a stone and needs to be fixed or upgraded immediately. 

Overall, we had budgeted \~40k and ended up paying \~40k (despite some line items going over and others under), and it was talking transparently to other engaged couples and newlyweds about costs that made realistic budgeting possible. I'm happy to share more details if people are interested, and I'll leave you with some images, so you know how this budget translated into an actual wedding!

1lgeiod,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sea_Bodybuilder_3277/comments/1lgeiod/saw_this_hand_blender_on_youtube_and/,Saw this hand blender on youtube and…,"Here’s the video that started it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEP0m6ll6rQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEP0m6ll6rQ) 



I was just trying to figure out if hand blenders are worth it for soups and got sucked in. The guy in the video showed this full set from MuellerLiving and I was like… wait why does this thing have seven attachments?? At first I thought it was too much- who needs a frother, whisk, dual beaters, dough hooks, potato masher and a chopper bowl with their stick blender? But the longer I looked into it, the more I started realizing: this might actually be a really practical alternative to buying 4-5 separate tools.



What I found digging into the MuellerLiving immersion blender set:

It’s got a 500W motor which is on the higher end for handhelds. Multiple sites mentioned that it doesn’t stall or overheat during normal use

8 speed settings + a turbo button- probably more control than I’d need but nice if you’re blending something delicate vs dense

The attachments are the wild part:

\> Stainless steel blending shaft (standard)

\> Whisk and milk frother (for eggs, whipped cream, frothy coffee etc)

\> Dual beaters and dough hooks (!!) kind of rare for hand blenders

\> A potato masher attachment- didn’t know this was a thing but people said it helps avoid gluey mashed potatoes

\> A 20oz chopper bowl for stuff like onions, garlic, nuts, etc.



I checked a few review sites just to make sure I wasn’t being swayed by clever marketing. A lot of sites reviewed the core model (same motor) and said it has “bombproof” construction and holds up better than most cheap ones. They liked the grip and found it didn’t overheat, even on longer runs.



Also read a bunch of Amazon reviews (some suspiciously glowing but a lot felt legit) and a few common things came up:

People liked that cleanup is fast.. most of the parts are dishwasher safe

Works great for soups, sauces, baby food, whipped cream and light chopping

Some said the whisk starts to wobble if you use it with heavy batters

Doesn’t crush frozen fruit super smoothly.. more of a “soft blend” tool than a full on blender replacement



Not saying everyone needs this but… If you live in a small apartment or dorm and don’t want a million appliances taking up space, something like this seems like a solid multitasker. Especially if you’re into one pot cooking or make a lot of blended things. I also kinda love that it’s one of those tools that looks gimmicky at first but turns out to be genuinely useful. Like yeah a potato masher attachment sounds dumb until you realize it saves your wrists and gives better texture than smashing with a spoon or fork. Would love to hear if anyone’s used this one long term. Or if there’s a better stick blender + attachment combo I should be looking at instead?

i got woken up at 3 AM (philippine time) on a rainy night to what i didn't even know were my husky's death howls. for a second, i thought this was just one of those episodes where my husky makes a racket.  

but nope. my sister came down to check on him, and i didn't even realize that those death howls resulted from intense shock, shaking, hallucinating and foaming at the mouth. at the time, i wasn't sure it was what it was (rabies), but until i came to hear my sister telling me that he was gone, and to the sound of her crying, i couldn't believe what i saw...  
  
a massive and fat toad (possibly a cane toad) and 2 smaller toads were standing still dead (the two smaller toads were dead with their entrails) in our gated subdivision porch.  
  
and so was my husky, lying flat, no longer breathing.  
  
i've got no idea how this came to be. whether he ate it or licked it or whatever, he was gone. the dog i've owned as a puppy since college and named after my caffeine addiction, gone just like that. in the middle of the night.  
  
to TOADS.  
FROGS.  
  
TOADS  
  
i'm still pissed crying a bit while typing this. what a cruel way for a dog to go, in the middle of the night, in the most unexpected way possible.  
  
how the hell did an obese toad break into a really REALLY narrow gate with a ceiling and basically no other way to get in unless it jumps over this 7-something foot gate? perhaps it crawled UNDER the gate just to KILL MY DOG. AND WHY.  
  
and to think he just recovered from biting at his tail and growing his fur back. i am at a loss for words. i'm mad that i haven't cried enough. maybe i'm just desensitized to death. but hearing my sister tell me that he's gone while crying at 3 AM is all i needed to hear.  
  
i still remember him chasing after me all the way to the entrance after coming home from work after my first week all those months ago, me and my sister giving him a lot of exercise as a result.  
  
if only i realized it sooner i would've treated him or scared the toads off before he could've done something. but nope. too late for that. it's over. he hadn't even gone past 10 years and frogs took him away just like that.

I'd agree with the consensus that it definitely isn't required. In my time though, it's certainly helped.

I started in audit at PwC. Quite quickly I was bored and didn't engage too much. I knew what I was doing but my papers were sloppy and filled with constant small issues. Sort of just below average for most of my time in audit.
My drinking though? A+

I would be first at the bar and last to leave. The whole time talking shit and having a laugh with people. When the senior came to planning work, he knew me as being at least switched on and a laugh. I got the more difficult sections of the audit, and the exposure that came with it.

When there was whispers of a new client, I was 10 drinks in with the manager. She let spill what was planned and I got in on it early. We had a good laugh together and she liked to have me about even if my work wasnt great. That client later became a job for me.

There was one partner who was notoriously difficult. I didn't work with him till my 3rd year. In my first month though, we were a mess dancing along to ABBA. Not for the last time either.
When he has things to criticise, my peer was chewed out in front of the whole room. He gave me a quiet heads up and advice on what to fix when we went to get coffee. 
The other guy was definitely better than me and i know my work was worse, but I got off lighter.
My reviews were consistently average+, despite slightly crappy work.

After audit I moved to FP&A in a supply chain outsourcing company. 
Most of the finance people are pretty quiet. When it comes to the pub, I'm the only one with one of the regional directors hanging off my neck saying he loves me. A few weeks later, when he has a proposal to the board and needs someone from finance to be involved, guess who he comes to.
I've been here just shy of 2 years and have recently been promoted. I think thr biggest factor in getting that was the exposure I got because of things like that.

There are probably some caveats to this. I am in the UK and my current company is very much blue collar in its core. Both of which probably lead to a stronger than average drinking culture.
I do think this isn't just networking though. I'm actually not great with that. Even if you're good, there's a certain level that you'll struggle to reach with some people anywhere prior to 5 beers.

While I think it's true that you can have a good career while being dry, I can't deny the importance  of being able to drink.  It's a very useful tool you miss out on. It's not particularly fair, but it's definitely real.

Was curious what it was so I had her show me the title and the synopsis, but of course I forget the title!

What I remember of the synopsis: ""A hitman is hired to kill a woman, but upon seeing her, he decides he'd rather have her love instead""

IIRC, it was a 80's or 90's movie. The genres I remember were Thriller/Romance. 

The scene I remember was, I think they're in a diner, and the man is ordering for the woman. He gets her a half of grapefruit, a slice of wheat toast, a glass of orange juice, and a cup of black tea with honey (the waitress didn't have what he initally wanted to get for her) 

He then orders himself a couple hamburger patties, medium rare, and a black coffee. 

And he begins like, directing her? I think? Telling her what she does and doesn't like, like he's priming her to pretend to be someone else? That's it. I know it's not a lot but it's driving me nuts not knowing what it's called

Hey RetirementReady fam! 🙌 Let’s talk about that golden period we all dream about—retirement. Picture this: You’re sipping coffee on a beach, not a care in the world. Sounds perfect, right? But how do we get from the saving grind to these sunset adventures?

Honestly, crafting the retirement of our dreams is all about working smarter, not harder. Let’s unpack some fun and effective tips to kickstart your journey! 🎉

### Start with a Budget: Your Roadmap Begins Here
- **Where’s your money going?** Tracking your spending can turn into a treasure hunt. You’ll be surprised at just how many lattes or subscriptions can quietly drain your funds.
- **Establish those goals.** Do you want to travel the world? Build a cozy cabin by the lake? Write that novel? Write it all down. Nothing's too big or too small!

### Connect Back to Your Values
- Think about what truly **fuels your fire**. Is it adventure? Family time? Learning new skills? Knowing what excites you can help you prioritize your savings!
- **Empowers people to choose how they live as they age.** Check out this great resource to help map out your financial future [here](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb) 🧭

### Build Your Dream Team
- **Get a solid financial advisor**—someone who speaks your language and gets your goals. Seriously, having a partner in planning makes a huge difference!
- **Find your accountability buddies!** Whether it’s friends or a retirement group, sharing fears and leaps forward keeps the momentum rolling.

### Invest in Experiences, Not Just Savings
- Treat yourself occasionally! If you're saving responsibly, an experience or a small treat can work wonders for your motivation.
- Ever thought about a travel fund? Start saving for that epic road trip or bucket-list vacation. Trust me, future-you will thank you!

### Reflect and Adapt
- Your roadmap isn’t set in stone. Life throws curveballs, and that’s okay!
- Regularly check in with your progress. Celebrate the little wins while adjusting your course when needed.

Finally, I’ll toss in a light-hearted reminder: retirement is like being in endless summer vacation, except with more naps and less homework. 🌞

The road to retirement isn't always smooth—there are patches of trepidation and excitement along the way. Just remember; it's an adventure in itself. So, what are your thoughts? Any tips or stories to share? Let’s keep this chat going! 🥳📖",1,1750451535.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Hey folks,

I totally get it—another tab manager. But hear me out: I built Snooz because I needed something dead-simple that did exactly one thing well—organize my tabs—without all the extra bells and whistles. I started using it in developer mode for myself, and after it solved my own tab chaos I decided to polish it up and publish it on Chrome store and share it here.

Here’s why you might give it a go:

* **Just the essentials.** No feature bloat—just folders and “save” buttons.
* **Friendly UI.** Snooze tabs, bookmark them, choose or create a folder and boom, your tabs are tucked away in seconds.
* **Totally free.** For now it’s 100% free, though donations are welcome to help cover hosting and future tweaks.
* **Key extras.** Dark mode, one-click save/close, and import/export for easy backups.

I made this for myself first, so it’s built around real-world needs: quick tab capture, minus complexity. If you try it, I’d love to hear what you think—what clicks, what could be smoother, or any small features you’d find handy

I’d love some outside perspective,"It’s been five months now since a new colleague joined my office. There are three men and one woman, including her. One of the men is 20 years older than she is, another is about 10 years younger, and I’m the same age as her.

I know she’s not like this at all with the others — not with the guys in our office, nor with anyone else. When we haven’t seen each other for a while, she’ll even tell me that she missed me, for example.

There’s something particular between us: we often exchange glances, while the others stay focused on their screens and don’t really interact with her visually. Since she arrived, I’ve noticed that she regularly throws me smiles or insistent looks. She only starts conversations when we’re alone; as soon as someone else walks in, she cuts the conversation or shifts it to strictly professional topics.

When I’m alone in the cafeteria, she often comes to grab a coffee and we start chatting about more personal topics. Sometimes, the conversations get a bit flirty, but always under control — like a game of cat and mouse. She sometimes walks me to the parking lot, or I walk her there, and during those moments we have open and interesting conversations. For example, she once asked me about the craziest adventures I’ve had when I was younger. Another time, we talked about “doing stupid things,” and she told me that for her, it depends on the person, what she stands to gain, and that her decisions depend on those factors.

There was also a conversation that started drifting toward the subject of how she likes it when men are upfront about what they want — whether it’s something serious or just for fun — and that people should just say things openly.

And I’m not even mentioning the way she sometimes walks ahead of me with a very confident stride, only to turn and flash a smile at the end of the hallway.

Once, during a conversation while I was walking her to her car, things got so heated that it caused a physical reaction in me… which I think was noticeable. She often asks me for help, and there are times when our hands touch, like when we’re both using the computer mouse, for example.

We also get a lot of chances to be alone together — like on remote sites related to our projects, where no one else is likely to show up unexpectedly.

So, I can’t help but wonder: is there a game going on between us? Or is she just very relaxed and open by nature?",0,1750451238.0,AskWomenOver30,10,0.33,False

But paradoxically, as desperate as I am for a nap during the day, most days I really struggle to fall asleep! It's as if the world of unconsciousness is barred by a gate and I'm pressed firmly up against that gate...but it won't allow me entry. I'll sometimes have a little REM creep in to that liminal state...as if it is reaching through the bars of the gate and grabbing me, but it never sticks...I'm still conscious. I can't actually shake the intense exhaustion either, so I'm stuck between worlds. With the pressure of exhaustion denying me entry into the world of the living...I feel like a cranky zombie. I bring ear plugs and an eye mask everywhere just in case I need to pull over and take a nap. Sometimes I can fall asleep, but other times it just feels like my HR is too high or something and I just can't cross that threshold into sleep.

Due to other health conditions, I cannot treat my narcolepsy with anything other than coffee, which is not super effective at helping me feel awake. It works for about 30 min and then I crash again. Definitely want to limit the amount of caffeine I consume in the afternoon so I will only do that a maximum of 3x/day. Then I'm just tired but wired. And maybe that's why I can't access nap world.

i thought working hard means working all the time. Like, literally. sleep? Maybe 4-5 hours if lucky. Food? Forget proper meals, just quick snacks or coffee. 

exxercise? hah no time for that nonsense. Friends? Family? Sorry, busy building. My mind was only on code, users, features, marketing... 24/7 hustle mode. Felt like a machine, super proud of how much I could push.

Then... my body say enough. It started small, you know? Always tired, even after little sleep. headaches become normal. Feeling stressed every minute, like heart beating too fast for no reason. but I ignored Just push little more I thought. Launch is close, then I rest.

Big mistake. One morning, I try to get up from bed... and everything spins. Like crazy spinning. Heart pounding like drum, hands shaking, couldnt breath properly. Felt like dying, seriously. Panic attack? Maybe. Or just total collapse. Had to call for help, it was so scary. Doctor later say my body is screaming from exhaustion stress bad food   no movement. Blood pressure high, vitamins low, whole system messed up....

That moment.. it hit me hard. I was not strong, I was stupid. Ignoring basic human needs is not dedication, it is self-destruction. My dream almost killed me because I forgot I am human first, founder second. Felt so ashamed, so angry at myself. How could I be so blind? My pride took a big hit. Thought I was tough, but real toughness is knowing when to stop.

So, I am forced to stop. Completely. Doctor orders. ClearMVP is on pause. It hurts, seeing my baby stalled. But what choice? I cannot work if I am broken.

What you should learn from my dumb mistakes (please):

  Your body talks, LISTEN! Tiredness, headaches, stress... these are warnings. Not badges of honor. Don't ignore like me until it screams.

Sleep is not lazy, it is fuel. Without good sleep, your brain is mush, decisions bad. 4 hours is not enough, trust me.

Eat proper food, not just fuel. Your body needs good things to run, not just coffee and chips. Cooking take time? Do it anyway.

Move your body. Even small walk. Sitting all day kills you slowly. I feel it now.

Solo doesnt mean superman. Working alone is hard, but you still need breaks, need to talk to people, need to switch off. Feeling lonely? Reach out. Don't isolate.

Hustle culture is poison. Working 18 hours a day is not success, it is path to crash. Sustainable work is real work.

Your worth is not your output. I tied everything to ClearMVP's success. If it failedd I failed. This is wrong thinking. You are more than your work.

Now recovery is slow. Very slow. Some days I feel useless, just resting. But I am learning. Learning to cook simple meals. Learning to walk outside without thinking about work. Learning to sleep 7-8 hours. It feels weird, like I am loosing time, but I know it is necessary.

Is ClearMVP dead? I don't know yet. Maybe. But I cannot be dead for it. My health is the real MVP now. Building it back slowly, painfully.

If you are reading this, working crazy hours, ignoring your body... please stop. Look at me. Don't wait for the crash. It's not worth it. Build your business, chase your dream, but BUILD YOURSELF too. You are the foundation. If foundation cracks, everything falls.

Take care of yourself. Seriously. Don't be like me. Learn from my pain.",3,1750450817.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

The goal being to give a traveler a useful full day itinerary in the area and highlight things to do, where to eat, drink and grab a good cup of coffee and be a useful travel companion overall. 

I've highlighted a few places like Connaught Patisserie, Mercato Mayfair and the Royal Academy of Arts. For coffee, my wife and I enjoyed HR Higgins so I included that as well.

I think the biggest challenge I am having is that obviously Mayfair is a bit more expensive than other areas and so the breadth of places you could go can vary (everything from a regular restaurant all the way to world famous ones). I mostly selected places we went to or were thinking of going ourselves.

1lgdxya,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1lgdxya/specialty_coffee_how_does_it_affect_your_gut/,Specialty Coffee: How does it affect your gut?,"A bit of background for my query: I got into specialty coffee in the midst of COVID. I found a local cafe after being a pretty dogmatically Starbucks Americano type of guy. The turn to coffee in general was in trying to establish healthier habits after years of trying to kick soda and energy drinks.

Not long after I started building my specialty habit (coffee, gear, etc) I developed health problems. Without going into details I’ll just say that they’re IBS adjacent. 

Today after years of preferring coffee, I went without and had tea instead. Yes, it’s a small sample size but unfortunately (because I’m passionate about coffee) I feel less symptomatic. So finally my question is do any of you find that lighter roasted, more acidic specialty coffees cause you to have gut/motility issues? If so, what ways do you mitigate symptoms? Less coffee, eat something beforehand, specific supplements, etc.

1lgdvtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lgdvtn/there_were_two_identical_flights_to_new_york_i/,There were two identical flights to New York. I don’t think the one I got on was real.,"Airports make my skin crawl.

Not anything about the building itself, but everything that comes with it. The constant squeaking of shoes against newly polished tile. The sound of crying babies, and the murmured apologies of their parents.

And the smell, too.

The airport, in general, was a mess of various scents. Some pleasant, like freshly baked pretzels, and some not so pleasant, like the stench of body odour. It was a sensory nightmare, and I avoided it whenever I could. I was content with living the rest of my life in my little town, in the same country. However, fate had other plans.

One of my friends, Julian, told my mom he was heading across the country for school. She saw it as the perfect opportunity to get me out of the house. I applied, thinking my grades were too low to matter.

But, since God hates me, I got in.

The plan was set. Julian would've already arrived at New York before I even left, meaning he would pick me up the moment my flight landed. Before I knew it, the day arrived and Mom was dropping me off at the airport.

“It’s time to grow up, Marin,” Mom said, placing a hand on my shoulder.

After one final hug and goodbye, she left, leaving me utterly alone, gazing up at the sterile edifice towering over me. Before I entered, the smell of sanitation spray and coffee wafted through the automatic doors. I checked my watch. 3:30 AM. With a sigh, I entered the airport, my suitcase rolling behind me.

I weaved through families, businessmen, and employees alike until I finally reached a respite; a large screen with some dated software, displaying flight times. Scanning the list, I found mine: Gate 5, 5:00 AM, New York. I was granted a short amount of relief that was instantly dashed when I saw the flight below mine. Everything matched—same gate, same flight, same time.

Except for one thing:

Nwe York.

I frowned, squinting in the dim light. That couldn't be right. I knew the airport was old, but surely they wouldn’t miss such an obvious mistake, right? It was something so trivial, but it bothered me to no end. I hobbled over to a worker and alerted her of the error. She just blinked twice before snorting.

""First time?"" She asked, and I nodded sheepishly. ""Yeah, I thought so. Don't worry, I'm sure it's just a glitch. Nothing for you to worry about."" Her tone was nonchalant, and I felt myself relax just a little bit.

She was right. What was I worrying for? The technology looked like it was made in the 90s, and the airport was built in the 50s, and I was worried about a simple misspell? It was just the nerves talking. And yet, despite repeating the mantra in my head countless times, I couldn't get rid of the feeling of dread looming over me.

I sat at the terminal for around twenty minutes, just watching the people around me and thinking about nothing. Eventually, the PA system came on and the automated voice announced my flight's boarding time.

""Now boarding Group A for Flight 5B to JFK International, departing from Gate 5."" I looked up and saw a large gathering of people at a gate nearby. The crowd moved as one, shuffling forward like a line of ants.

I grabbed my bag, took a deep breath, and walked into the mob.

There was a woman who was taking the tickets. She wore the traditional uniform for most workers at the airport and wore a stoic expression.

""Ticket?"" She said, holding out a hand. I handed her mine, and she checked it. Her eyebrows furrowed for a moment. My heart stopped. Were there problems with my ticket? Was she going to ask me to step aside? She checked the screen again, then at me, before nodding once and stamping my ticket. I breathed a sigh of relief. The line progressed slowly until finally, I was on the plane.

It was... not what I was expecting. I've heard many stories from my friends about airplanes being noisy, with people chatting away, or the sound of children playing with toys. It was dead silent. Not in a peaceful way, though. It was a foreboding silence, like the kind you'd expect from a funeral home. I was sat beside an older woman who, from what I could tell by my peripheral vision, was staring directly at the back of the seat in front of her.

I know this doesn't sound weird, but when I say staring ahead, I mean she didn't move at all, not even to blink. The entire time. And it wasn't just her, it was everyone on the plane, too. I couldn't see much, because the seats were in the way, but I could tell that they were all just sitting there, not moving a muscle. Out of fear of drawing attention, I sat just as stiffly, my shoulders hunched.

My other neighbour, a businessman, settled into his seat with a sigh. He took out his laptop and opened it, the screen lighting up the area around us in an unnatural glow. Now being able to compare what a normal person looked like on the plane to everyone else, the oddities of the others were even more apparent.

As I redirected my attention back to my surroundings, my heart stopped. The older woman was now glaring at the business man. Her gaze was intense, as if she were trying to burn holes in the side of his head. The passengers in front had also turned around and were watching him work. My breath quickened as I glanced around the cabin. Everyone was doing the same thing; watching this man type away on his laptop, who was completely oblivious to the attention he was getting. When he lifted his head to stretch and saw the dozens of eyes staring at him, his face paled.

He didn't say anything, but I could see the panic in his eyes. He shifted in his chair, head darting from one passenger to another, before finally settling on me. I could see the question in his gaze; the silent plea for help, but I had no answers. I didn't know the rules, but at that moment I knew he had broken one. I just shrank in my seat, clamping my eyes shut.

I didn't dare open them again, not even when the man's typing had stopped. All I could hear was the soft hum of the engine. Nothing that indicated there was anything living or breathing on this plane. When I did open my eyes, the seat to my left was empty. Not even an indent of where he sat.

Now, I wasn't really the superstitious type, nor was I the type to believe in the supernatural or paranormal. But I also couldn't deny what had just happened before my eyes. Whatever the explanation was, something was seriously wrong. My mind was racing with questions, but I couldn't focus on any of them. All I could do was try to keep calm and remain still, careful not to let my breath get too loud or uneven, as it seemed like the smallest disturbance could draw unwanted attention to myself.

Suddenly, the screens that were embedded into each seat turned on, and I just barely managed to fight off the urge to gasp. However, I did flinch, prompting my neighbour to turn her head ever so slightly towards me. I froze, stared straight forward, and waited until she had returned her gaze back to the screen. Once she had done so, I let out the breath I was holding in.

A safety video started playing, which was strange since we had already taken off, but this was far from the strangest thing about the plane, so I didn't question it. It was a rather standard video, the type that you would see on any other commercial airline, with grey animated characters showing how to fasten the seat belt. I followed along with the animation and strapped myself in.

Click.

All at once, however many people that were on this plane also strapped themselves in with a unified click. I was off by a few milliseconds, but either those... things didn't notice, or were too distracted by the few stragglers who were off by several seconds. Others like me and the businessman, I assumed. Once again, the attention of the old woman and, assumedly, all the other passengers was focused on the latecomers. I didn't need to see to know that they too disappeared without a trace, just like the man next to me.

The video continued, and text appeared on the screen. I couldn't even read it on account of how many letters were mixed up. It was like a keyboard mash, and I couldn't make out a single word. But, somehow, I still got the general message: follow the instructions or face the consequences. At that point, I was pretty sure the consequences were death. So, for the rest of the video, I followed along with whatever it instructed, making sure I did everything exactly right, down to the second.

But it just kept going. Odd request after odd request with no rhyme or reason; press the call button three times, hold your breath for 10 seconds, close your eyes for 5... the list just went on. One by one, the remaining humans on the plane were picked off. A man coughed during the 10-second holding session. He was gone. Another person forgot to put their phones on silent. They were gone. A baby started wailing in the back while the mother tried desperately to calm it. I shut my eyes and willed the tears forming in them to stay, the lump in my throat to go down, and my heart to stop its rapid thumping. No rhythm that might set me apart.

The crying ceased instantly. They were gone.

Soon, I was the only human left on the plane. I like to think that maybe someone else was as good as me at following the instructions, and maybe they made it through unscathed, but I had no way of knowing. After around an hour, the video finally ended, leaving me with nothing but the faint droning of the plane's engine. For hours. I was slick with sweat and my heart hammered at a pace a hair's breadth away from bursting. My lungs ached, desperate for a deep breath, and my muscles burned from tensing up, but I dared not move.

The plane was just supposed to travel across the country, maybe an hour or two, but the flight had long passed that. Fear subsided, replaced with a numbing, all-consuming sense of monotony. The boredom was unbearable, so I tried to distract myself by counting the number of breaths I took, or how many times the lights above my head flickered. It was the only way to keep me sane. That boredom gave way to exhaustion, gradually wearing down my body until I felt like I could barely keep myself upright. My eyelids became heavy, and it became harder to focus on anything around me. I couldn't even tell if I was still in the same plane or not. Everything was starting to blur together.

I concluded that, if I were to die, then having it happen in my sleep wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. So, with that thought in mind, I let my eyes close and cast myself into the void of unconsciousness.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we’d like to thank you for choosing-"" Static. ""-as your preferred airline. We hope that you choose to fly with us again. Local time is 9 PM and the temperature is a nice 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Please enjoy your visit to Nwe York.""

I was jolted awake by a voice crackling through the speakers, announcing our arrival to... New York. I had finally arrived. I forced the memories of the trip out of my hand, forced myself to ignore the empty seats around me, and the blank stares of the passengers, and walked out of the plane, rolling my luggage behind me. My heart nearly leaped out of my chest when I saw Julian's form standing in the lobby, holding a sign. I was nearly about to sprint towards him and give him the biggest hug of his life when I noticed something off about him. That big, dopey smile was gone. His face was a blank page, and his eyes didn’t spark with life, even as they met mine.

And the sign he was holding read, ""Wlecome to Nwe York, Mairn.""",29,1750450531.0,nosleep,2,0.95,False
