1g1wxq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g1wxq6/my_29f_boyfriend_25m_falsely_accused_me_always_of/,My (29F) boyfriend (25M) falsely accused me always of cheating or hiding things ,"We have 6 year relationship , and from the beginning things were worse with accusations . Things got better over time but I am angry when he is starting argument with different questions and don t trust me and is EXHAUSTING after this years he still not trusting me . I give up on having social media, posting pictures , having friends , going out . All this things to gain his trust . Because all of this triggered arguments and in the end I was the crazy because I get mad if he asks something and why I am mad if I don‚Äôt  hide something. I give some examples of things that happened and triggered him : Likes on photos from people I didn‚Äôt know( if I get likes it means I talk with this people) , if I was going out with my only friend like girls at coffee shop I needed to photo her and the seats next to us to see if not is someone else with us , if I going out even with my mom but now he understand this , if I woke up at 10 he acuse me I did something else maybe that s why I sleep too much so I have alarm at 8-9 to not sleep too much , if I go to store I get anxiety if o stay too much maybe he will think I am doing something else , if I don‚Äôt respond at phone means I did something , always when i go out even at the store I need to tell him where I go and what I am doing . I understand is normal to let partner know what are you doing but I feel controlled. One day I was at gynaecologist but the doctor cannot do all the appointments and canceled my appointment and moved it to the next day and when I told him he did get mad and give me the silent treatment but I did nothing . I was so afraid even if some unpredictable things happened that he will acuse me of doing things. I never cheated, never did what he is acusing me. I was a virgin when he met me , I always tried to be a good girlfriend. Never think of another guy I was afraid even to go out with my sister . Last night when I was sleeping I was getting messages ‚Äú please explain this‚Äù a picture with my steam second account playing Call of duty with someone . On that steam account my sister plays sometimes and he knows it . Then he saw it was my sister and said ‚Äú oh is your sister ‚Äú . But that triggered in me so much anger and hate because I am sick on this acusations . When I get angry he says ‚Äú I can t even ask a question? Is not an accusation is a question stop being so mad ‚Äú . And a looot of questions like this happened during or relationship and I am soo confused . Everyone in my family says is not normal , but I always think maybe they are wrong . I don‚Äôt have friends anymore to ask someone from outside . I am constantly living in fear if I make something that triggers him. I know is not normal to feel this way but when I talk about it is always my fault and I am overreact for some ‚Äúquestions ‚Äú


TL;DR : My boyfriend always acuse me for cheating or hiding things. When I get mad he always says it s not acusations and it s my fault getting mad and he is not doing anything wrong but I feel so confused and anxious . ",1,1728727671.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1g1wwmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g1wwmj/wibta_new_housemate_drank_our_liquor/,WIBTA: New housemate drank our liquor ,"TLDR: New housemate, finished special bottles, opened two more. My current plan is to politely tear him a new one.


My partner and I live together, needed another roomie to afford the mortgage. Long process, lots of interviewees, most had glaring character defects. This guy seemed normal and cool. Three weeks in, nothing glaring, some minor things but that‚Äôs life with a roomie.

My partner is out of town. New roomie got a cold, informed me to stay clear. Today he informed me he ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù some of my coffee and ‚Äúone shot of whiskey for a hot toddie‚Äù. He tried to pay me five bucks, I turned it down, not a big deal, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and I didn‚Äôt check anything.

Tonight I got home from Uber driving, went to pour myself a nightcap, and discovered that 2 very special partial bottles of very expensive bourbon that my partner and I had been saving are now empty, two more special bottles that we‚Äôve been saving have been opened and have significant volume missing.

We really need the rent. Otherwise this guy has been fine. But who the fuck finished fancy bottles of liquor that doesn‚Äôt belong to them?!?! And who the fuck cracks open fancy bottles of liquor that doesn‚Äôt belong to them?!?! Are we living with a psychopath? Or an alcoholic?
I plan to absolutely ream him out, no yelling, no name calling. But strongly point out the cost of the bottles, the sentimental value of the bottles, and how fucked up it is to just help yourself to other people‚Äôs stuff. I plan to not be condescending or treat him like a child, but I definitely want to get my point across in no uncertain terms that leaves him thinking and maybe feeling bad too.

So, will I be the asshole?

Yesterday, I finally got confirmation that I have PCOS after discussing my blood tests, swabs, and scans with my doctor. I had a feeling this might be the case, especially since I was hospitalized two years ago for an ovarian cyst. Since then, I‚Äôve noticed that my abnormal hair growth has gotten much worse, along with other symptoms like irregular and heavy periods.

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. I have some unhealthy habits that I know I need to work on, but it's going to be tough. I‚Äôm addicted to coffee, sweets, and carbs. On top of that, I smoke J's, vape, and I don't exercise as much as I should.

I was really anxious during my call with the doctor, so I didn‚Äôt ask the questions I needed to. I work from 8:30 AM to 5 PM, and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure how to begin making the lifestyle changes I know are necessary.

Any advice or support on how to get started would mean the world to me. Thanks in advance!

I 33,male haven‚Äôt spoken to my cousin or aunt for almost four years due to them disrespecting my wife, going through the personal boxes I had stored at my grandma's house, and for accusing me of trying to take everything in her house and selling it. My grandmother who raised me passed away about 4 years ago. I moved out of her house 1 year prior then covid happened. After she passed away my cousin 36, female moved into my grandma‚Äôs house. I tried to reach out to my cousin every couple of months to find time to get my stuff out of the house but no response. I heard from my dad that he was going to be selling the house soon and I needed to get my personal belongings and the rest of the stuff Grandma left me out of the house before the new owners came in a month. I was finally able to get ahold of my cousin after 4 years when I sent her a Facebook message since she wasn‚Äôt answering my personal texts or phone calls. I had to make a Facebook to do this. When I arrived at the home my dad reminded me that since my cousin was staying there if she asked me to leave I had to leave. I let him know I‚Äôd be calling the police to retrieve the rest of my belongings if that happened. I just want my stuff my grandma before she passed away boxed everything up for me that was mine during my childhood and the boxes I had from moving back to the state from out of state and put them out in the garage from my bedroom. The only other things inside the house were some photo albums, my dresser, a Christmas tree, and an entire bookcase of books from the office. I brought a 6x12 U-Haul due to the number of boxes I had in the garage and I was hoping the 6 x 12 would fit everything. To my dismay, I found that the boxes were cut open and gone through and I could see my books and childhood memories were spread around the house. These werent just trinkets or random things these were my memories of my childhood my personal items. My cousin and I got into a disagreement about my things and she was stating that everything in that house belonged to her. My aunt and uncle were there and my aunt and cousin started to yell and scream at my wife calling my wife trash, saying she‚Äôs the reason why we don‚Äôt speak anymore and she‚Äôs the reason why I threatened to call the police. This shocked me because these were my decisions and my wife has done nothing but help and be there for everyone especially during my grandmothers passing. She bought coffee, made food, and ordered take out. My wife thought she was in great terms with the entire family so this hurt her too. I made it very clear that no I made those decisions because I wanted my stuff back after not being able to get into contact with my cousin for all this time. My wife came with me to help me move everything into the U-Haul and I used her car because she has a trailer hitch on it. I asked for the Christmas tree and what happened to the boxes in my old bedroom. My cousin and aunt said all your stuff is in the garage. I pointed out my books, and coin collection that I did from the Boy Scouts were displayed and they were mine. I just told them I wanted my stuff. I wanted to get my things and just leave because I had a 2-hour drive back home. Suddenly my aunt said you‚Äôre just trying to get your hands on my mother's stuff to sell it for money. This is what 
caused me to be done with them for good. Not only did they go through my things, take whatever they wanted, and disrespected my wife but to also make a statement like that I lost all respect for them. My grandma wasn‚Äôt just a grandma to me she raised me. I lived with her growing up 95% of my childhood and she supported me through everything. She was always there I called her mom. I know it sounds weird but my heart broke when my aunt said that. I grabbed the 6 boxes that were there and we left. 

I cut off my dad due to his non stop threats of disowning me over this and him trying to force reconciliation with them and much more this he‚Äôs done to me. My grandpa disowned me now because I told him I don‚Äôt want to deal with this bullshit anymore I just want to be happy. 

I asked my dad and grandpa if i disrespected his wife my step mom or my step grandma like that they would be ok with it ? They both said no so im suppose to be ok with my aunt and cousin disrespecting my wife and me? 

The Therapist has said no, that cutting off toxic people is ok but am I the asshole for not wanting these people in my life and cutting them off? Or should I just get over it

We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîexploring new cities, searching for that perfect hidden gem of a coffee shop or a co-working spot, and then suddenly finding yourself in a sketchy area you weren‚Äôt prepared for. I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbo1AByH2Oc) crazy video where someone wandered into one of Colombia‚Äôs most dangerous neighborhoods, right into a crack den, and had a run-in with a sicario (hitman). It got me thinking‚Äîhow many of us digital nomads have stumbled into similar risky situations while traveling?

* **What city/country were you in when you realized you were in a rough neighborhood?**
* **Did you accidentally end up there while looking for a place to work or explore, or was it intentional?**
* **How did the locals react to you? Were you able to blend in, or did you feel like a total outsider?**
* **What was the moment you thought, ‚ÄúI need to get out of here‚Äù?**
* **How did you handle it, and what advice do you have for fellow nomads who might find themselves in similar situations?**

As nomads, we love the freedom to explore new places and cultures, but sometimes we can unknowingly walk straight into trouble, especially in countries where we‚Äôre unfamiliar with the dynamics of certain neighborhoods.

Kitchen Manager Jules Secommends Sheila Be Kitchen Slave For A Day. Sheila's Slave Sentence Gets Extended Three Days. Mary Picks Sheila As Her Bottom Slave, For Her Alpha Slave Test On QOM's Compound. ","Sheila's perspective 11:30 AM Staff Kitchen

Jules finally turns her salacious smirk off of me to examine the orders written in Sandy's notebook. She nods and says, ""That's doable."" She shouts for one of her minions, and a cute nineteen to twenty year old blondie girl shows up. The girl gives me one suprised wide eyed glance, but then turns her gaze on her boss as she relays the drink orders, nodding and jotting them down on her own pad. Before she goes to fill the order, she looks at me again briefly, and giggles. Then she disappears back into the kitchen.

I know I must have reddened with embarrassment under the latex hood. I thought I knew slavery and humiliation. But going from a lofty position to a bottom slave is even more degrading. I always felt sorry for Mary after her demotion, even though I wasn't as close with her as the other girls. but now I could really empathize with her. I tried not to encourage Nora's bullying of Sub Mary, but I did very little to discourage it. Having gotten a taste of it myself, twice, I wish I'd done more.

I mmmphed nervously and flinched  as I saw Jule's hands reaching toward my face. ""Shhh, sweetie, relax, your headress is a little crooked, I'm fixing it."" She said this almost kindly as she adjusted my frilly white maid's headpiece. I relaxed marginally.

She was within her rights, according to what Sandy told me during a slow stretch earlier this morning. The only man allowed to touch my uniform at all was Dave, and that was just to write in my infraction book. Women were forbidden to touch my private parts, except my dommes. But female employees could adjust my uniform and write in my infraction book.
They couldn't give me a demerit unless they were an actual domme. But they could write ""recommendations"" for me in the book. It could get pretty humiliating depending on how long this went on.

Speaking of which, the Duty Manager I pissed off pulled out my infraction book and started to flip through it idly with a neutral expression.  Then she looked up at me with an unpleasant grin. ""I know what I'll recommend, if this goes on long enough and they can squeeze it in, you'll make a great kitchen slave for me and my staff. Make you do our dirtiest and most menial tasks. 
Maybe then you'll see we work a little  harder than a McDonald's staff."" She pulled out a pen clipped to a pocket on her uniform and wrote out her recommendation in my book. I hoped fervently she didn't get her wish no matter how long this carried on. I knew it might be one of my few new slave experiences that really compared to my ""Ari days"".

She put away her pen, flipped my infraction book closed, and stuffed it meticulously back in it's spot. The young blond came out with the tray of orders and put them carefully on my tray.

""Brianna"" Jules stated with a casual air. ""What do you think about Boss Bitch Sheila Connor here volunteering to be our little kitchen slave for a day?"" The younger staff member was turning to go back into the kitchen, but the question made her turn and start appraising me, hands on hips. She made an effort to scowl, but I saw a small amused smile playing on her lips.

Finally, she huffed and said ""I guess she'd be barely acceptable Jules, we could make her clean out the grease traps, and scrub the oven gunk that builds up. And I guess I could use a helper when you put me in the Deep Sink, if I can punish her if she can't keep up or leaves spots on my dishes.""

Jules looked pleased as she plucked out my book. ""Bri dear, those are great ideas, I'm going to write them down for her dommes to consider."" The nasty grins they exchanged as Brianna turned to go back in the kitchen, and her boss retrieved my book and wrote down her recommendations made me really nervous.

I'd never had to pull kitchen slave duty at Ari's. I'd heard Ari, Emily, Cara and Alpha Slave Julie laughing about making Sandy do it, and how they encouraged the kitchen staff, slaves and free servants alike to persecute her unfairly while she tried to do her assigned duties. At the time I had a thrill of vindictive pleasure at that little brat suffering something I didn't.

I wanted to get away as quick as possible, so after Jules replaced my infraction book in it's pouch, I took the calculated risk of trying to walk off without a dismissal. Unfortunately, the manager I pissed off wasn't done with me.

""You're not dismissed yet, my future little kitchen slave. The drinks will keep well I tell you exactly what happened on that day you posited I do less work than a fast food cook.""  She grabbed my leash and started jerking it to make her points as she detailed every thing she had to deal with that day. All I could do was try to appear the attentive slave, keep the drinks from spilling when she pulled my leash, and hope her tirade ended soon.

Sandy's Perspective

Dave has several monitors discretely mounted at his desk, where he could monitor the closed circuit camera system. We were all gathered around, watching as the kitchen manager lectured my sister while jerking her leash, the little bondage slave trying to keep the drinks from spilling. Poor thing.

On the other hand, I knew the story behind this kitchen Manager's wrath, and with a nod from Dave explained it to Mistresses Dao and Stacy. They seemed delighted at this added layer of humiliation for Sheila, even though we assured her it was a coincidence, we never even thought of the roster for the kitchen when we made up the little slave's domme plan.

""You guys really should work in that kitchen slave plan for her, I bet it would be a hoot."" Stacy made this proposal while giggling at an extra hard jerk Jules gave Sheila's leash.

Dave's voice seemed to really bring Stacy's offhand comment into focus. ""Why would we do that, unless you anticipate her not apologizing at the end of today?"" Dao and Stacy exchanged a look that made it clear there were things they weren't telling us. 

With Dave and I pointedly staring at her instead of the monitor, Stacy realized she better spill it. ""Uh, Queen Of Mean wants the apology in person, and due to her busy schedule she won't be able to make it over here in the next three days."" Dave stared at her pointedly, drumming his fingers on the desk. I don't know if the rumors about them fucking are true, but the dusky domme should have known Dave well enough by now, the lame half truth she just spat out wasn't going to fly.

She sighed and her shoulders slumped. ""The Queen Of Mean really liked the vids we sent her this morning of Slave Sheila. I mean really liked them. She would like to respectfully request Sheila be kept as a slave for three more days.""

Dave kept drumming his fingers. ""I will not keep extending her sentence arbitrarily. I think it's fair she learn some humility and how to play nice with others. But I refuse to keep her in bondage indefinitely, especially while gaslighting her about it. I will tell Queen Of Mean this personally, today, when I call her.""

Now it was Stacey's turn to look somber. ""Dave, QOM knows you, and she knows you have a lot more respect for Sheila than for Mary. Heck, we all do. We've got it in writing that no further extension of her current slave sentence beyond three days will be even proposed.""

I'd already texted the group chat the Perseverance girls added me to about the news. I told them to hold on questions, Dave and I were still getting the details. I'd keep them posted, and we'd discuss it when we convened Sheila's disciplinary board this evening.

Top Domme Layla: Good decisive leadership Mistress Sandy. You could've kicked the buck over to me, but you made a command decision on the spot, which is your right since she's your personal slave. I'm writing a recommendation letter for your Apprenticeship, this will be included.

Mistress Sandy: Thank you, Mistress Layla, I really am at a loss for words at your praise. üòä 
 
Top Domme Layla: You're welcome, keep up the good work, kid. 

""Sandy, what say you, she's your sister as well as your slave. You think three more days of slavery for your sister is a fair penance for her sometimes grating lack of social grace?"" Dave and the Hawaiian girl were looking at me pointedly. The Thai Mistress was harassing poor Sheila over the mike, the kitchen manager had released her to trudge back to the office with our drinks. I looked to make sure she didn't have the clit zapper in her hand. She didn't, which was a relief. A little verbal hazing was fine, but causing Sheila even minor pain for something that wasn't her fault was way over the line.

Dave and Stacy were still regarding me patiently. I sighed. ""She's really been such a good sport, I don't see why we can't end this. We've all had a turn punking boss bitch, and it's been fun, no real harm done except to her pride, which we all agreed needed to be whittled back just a little.""
Then my eyes turned to the monitor.

Sheila had been intimidated by the Thai Mistress at first I could tell. But despite the threats the short, muscular Asian breathed at her over the comm, her eyes just looked angry and resentful now. I really didn't want to ever see fear or terror in her eyes again.

But Constance told me about how brutally Sheila punked her and Mary over a percieved lack of respect when they were both bottom slaves. How she told both her and Mary she was sorry for the position they were in; but while they were in it she'd enforce respect for their betters as brutally as she needed to.

Now, she was getting a taste of what they felt. But she'd been toughned by Ari's brutal slavery, one day of what we were doing was relatively light by comparison. We probably needed time to get creative, like making her work as the kitchen slave, to really wear her stubborn pride down. And since we weren't brutal sadists like Mistress Arianna, we had to have time to plan a punking that would teach her a lesson without hurting her.

""On the other hand, she's arrogant and developed a thick skin as Loser Girl. Three more days to wear down her pride...maybe that's what's in order. Three more days...you'll find we'll all be unanimous with Dave, whatever happens, that Sheila will be free again.""

Now Stacy had a twinkle in her eye. ""Oh, Mistress Sandy, don't act like it's such a chore. You're all enjoying having her submissive and at your beck and call. Three more days to come up with some creative if safe humiliations for her  won't be so hard on any of you.""

Now Dave and I exchanged a smile. Her sister and boss were having fun. I could tell her protege Nora and her submissive Desi lover enjoyed the power exchange. Constance really liked being a dominatrix again, even in a support position. Hell, Layla respected Sheila like she respected few others. And Stacy told me the former Marine still enjoyed putting Sheila in her place like a raw recruit.

""I guess it won't, at that."" I saw our little bondage Maid was almost to Miri's reception room door. ""Speaking of which, I have a malingering slave to calibrate."" Now Dave, Stacy and Dao all had bemused grins as I stomped into the waiting room and towards the reception room door. I put on my sternest domme scowl.

I put my hands on my hips and blocked the doorway when she was a few steps from entering it. I was gratified when she let out a cute little muffled squeal and looked startled.

""You little moonbat, you were daydreaming and dawdling again! How dare you keep four of your superiors waiting! You know what, I'm going to let Mistress Dao issue your demerits and punishment!""

Now her eyes went hard and she started glaring back at my tirade. I winked and mouthed ""lighten up, sweetie. It has to look good."" Then I turned and dismissively waved for her to follow me. I knew her pretty eyes were boring into my back despite my attempt at reassurance.

Sheila's Perspective QOM's class room on Perseverance Set 2:30pm

I'm tied to a chair in QOM's classroom, the same one I think Mary was tied to when she was Nora's subbie. I'm still in my ridiculous bondage Maid getup that covers nothing, including that silly white maid's headress on my head. The only difference is my arms are now bindered behind me. I'm strapped to the chair above and below my naked breasts. Each leg strapped individually to a leg of the chair.

I am glad they're using the strong but supple leather straps that don't chafe, unlike the ratcheting cargo straps we initially used to secure Mary to her chair in the Ready Room. Of course once I saw these, I got Stacy to loan us some, so we could restrain Mary, and later Constance more comfortably. 

Mistress Dao had tied me to the chair and then left me there with no explanation. Not that she owed one to my naked slave ass...but when I was free again, Muay Thai skills weren't going to keep her and I from having a little talk.

My mind wandered back. I'd followed Sandy's cute ass back into Dave's Office. Mistress Dao snatched my infraction book as the others grabbed their drinks. I Expected her to make a big production of it, but she scribbled furiously in my book, then grabbed her drink as she replaced it in my pouch under my bare tits. Then she impatiently gestured for me to stand to her left as she sat down.

And that was it, I stood quietly as Sandy asked questions of Stacy and Dao and they replied. Stacy, also asked her questions, deceptively casual, but obviously underhand interview questions. My little sister didn't fall for it, always weighing and careful with her answers to any of Stacy's questions. Despite the situation, I was proud of my sibling Mistress for how well she carried herself in Stacy's disguised interview. She had definitely grown a lot...when we were apart.

Afterwards, Dave and Sandy walked Stacy and Dao out into the reception area. Sandy told me to ""Stand your slave butt right there until I come to fetch you."" I obeyed her and I should have been annoyed, but truth be told, being controlled like this was making my nipples stiffen and my ""loser hole"" wet. I tried to decrease my arousal by reminding myself the incest angle was still gross, even with no actual sex. But the thought that my sexy baby sister had me under her complete control...again...made me even wetter. Arrgh....

I let out a muffled shout as a hand clapped on my shoulder. ""Oh, Sheila, sis, I didn't mean to scare you."" Her delicate looking but strong hand turned me to face her.  ""It's time to go to lunch. Do you need to see medical?"" I mmmphed a no. ""Bathroom break or water, or can you hold off until we get to your apartment?"" I mmmphed ""Wait for my place, Mistress."" 

She said ""OK. I won't drag you on a leash, follow me a pace behind to my left. I called  security, Flo and her guards will try to keep people moving along and minimize gawkers. They had their fun this morning.""
I mmphed ""Yes Mistress. Thank you, Mistress."" Sandy nodded and turned. Presuming I'd follow. I shuffled after my sister/Mistress  obediently, a pace behind to her left. I was actually filled with gratitude she was actively working to minimize my humiliation...this time.

We got to the door and Nora  opened it before my Domme could knock could knock. Sandy, Nora and Lara hustled me inside and started removing my bondage gear. Then they massaged my limbs as I lay on the couch naked. When I told them I was good, Lara came forward to help me into my Robin egg blue robe.

Nora laid out my favorite: Thai Red Curry takeout, still steaming hot. We dug in washing it down with Thai iced tea. Sandy got a text from Dave extending my lunchtime to 1:30pm. That was good news, but something else she saw on the text made her look grim. I asked her what it was and she shook her head and told me to enjoy my lunch without worrying about it. I thought about pressing her...but she was going to be my domme again in about an hour, better to keep it respectful during my free hours and show I trust her to look after me as a subbie.

We actually joked around about the scene in the episode where ""Commander Gail"" accidentally drinks the brew which lower female sexual inhibitions and judgement; where she grinds on Ji after he pulls her off a stage dancing nude for amateur night. 

We laughingly told Sandy about how we all teased him about the big obvious bulge in his pants when Nora was clinging to him nude, and how he actually dumped a scoopful of ice from the hydration station down his pants so we could finish the scene. We managed to get camera angles that hid the wet spot in his pants until we finished the scene. Sandy elbowed Nora and chided her about being a little dick teaser. Nora blushed, looking like that young shy girl I met a few years back, instead of my poised if overzealous domme now. She said she never intended to make him uncomfortable...Sandy said she was just kidding.

I took responsibility for writing the scenes, and any discomfort it caused my colleagues. Nora got a serious look, almost a stern domme face...and ground out ""Do you really wonder why we want to pay you back when you write us into such embarrassing, awkward scenes?"" 

My expression must have looked upset, because she reached across to give me a friendly shove on the left arm with her right. ""Come on, chill out, Sheila, it was a joke. I'm really sorry I get carried away domming you, but I have nothing personal against anything you've done, really. Though that hot tub blowjob scene got annoying.""

I could understand that. The scene where Dora Gail pops up out of the water in Commodore Barnes's hot tub was a pain to shoot. Mostly because Nora really can't hold her breath a long time, and has trouble understanding direction with her head under the water.

After I took another bite of curry, Nora gently reached over to squeeze my shoulder. ""Sheila, don't worry about it, I'm not holding a grudge about anything you did for the show. Your vision helped bring me further in life than I could imagine, brought out in me things I didn't know I had in me...beauty, confidence...thank you.""

I was touched, and we were all silent a moment. Then she dropped her hand and smirked. ""Still, Sandy and Lara worked out a plan to make you clean out your coffee pot tomorrow, and make your smoking hot half breed butt even more famous."" The three other girls shared semi-predatory smiles, that reminded me I was a sub having pleasant lunch with three of her dommes.

After lunch I worked on scripts and storyboards with Nora and Lara. Sandy hovered around, really interested in the process of making the program come to life and asking a lot of questions. It wasn't annoying for me, I was glad she was taking such an interest. I think the other two enjoyed answering her questions and helping her understand how her favorite show was made.

At 1:20 I asked to be dressed out as a slave again. Sandy looked at her phone, then at me ""Are you sure Sheila? You have ten more minutes."" I replied ""Might as well be ready when it comes up."" Sandy nodded and ordered me to take off my robe and dress out in my bondage uniform.

While I was putting on my black bondage microskirt, Sandy got a text. She said to Nora and Lara ""Don't worry about the tray or rubber sleeves, we're bindering her arms behind her back."" I looked at her quizically as I adjusted my no coverage skirt and carefully seated my infraction book as perfectly as I could to avoid demerits.

""You have Bottom Slave class in the classroom in QOM's spaces on our set. Mistress Stacey will be your instructor, with Dao observing. Nora and I are both supposed to be there to keep you focused and help you study."" My heart dropped. I knew QOM's classes for subbies had little educational value, they were just an excuse for dommes to humiliate and demean subs.

Nora saw my trepidation. ""I know what you're worried about Sheila. Sandy and I will take it seriously, you better have good posture and be paying attention. We may quiz you so stay focused. We'll discipline you if we feel we need to, we won't torment you unnecessaryily. Focus on the lesson and obey us. Once class starts one of us will be with you at all times, so you're not alone with Stacy and Dao. Does that seem fair?""

I replied ""Yes."" Impressed by her confidence in taking charge. Nora glared pointedly at me until I amended my answer. ""Yes, Mistress Nora, thank you, Mommy."" Nora nodded, satisfied with my show of respect.

Lara and Sandy were looking at her with new respect as well. She'd taken charge and calmed her bottoms apprehensions, while demanding proper respect, without being a bully. This was the style we'd been trying to bring out since she first started domming Sarah. As much as I hated being a slave again, I was gratified my young friend really seemed to be taking the lesson to heart while domming me.

Sandy added ""Take the lesson seriously, Sheila, we will give you a twenty question quiz at the end of class."" I looked at her, a little hurt. ""It won't be like yesterday. Just get a passing grade and there'll be no punishment for what you got wrong. If we have time, Nora and I will remediate you on what you missed, or have one of the other girls do it. Expect to be disciplined for not paying attention, but if you do, no unfair punishments during the session.""

I said ""OK. Thank you, Mistress Sandy."" Sandy nodded. ""Stand up."" she ordered me. I obeyed, standing in the foyer. I'll put on her hood, gag and maid cap. Nora, you binder her arms. Lara,  when we're done, inspect our work, then touch up any of her body writing that might have gotten smudged."" 

As impressed as I was with Nora's leadership style, Sandy was clearly the natural leader of this group, I heard Nora move up behind me to binder my arms, which I helpfully held back behind me to make it easier to slip the armbinder on.

As Nora bound my arms, Sandy gently pulled the hood over my head and adjusted it, asking me questions so she could make it as comfortable as possible for me. 
She tied on my frilly maid's white headdress. Then smiled and held up a wad of multicolored cloth. I realized they were 5 pairs of ladies panties!

I wouldn't say Mistress Sandy's smile was cruel as she saw the realization in my eyes, but it was mischievous. ""Your ladies wanted to give you a special present while you were a slave, they decided on contributing a pair of panties each to stuff gag you. Don't worry, they were laundered last night, so they're clean."" 

Her voice dropped confidentially. ""They did ask me to contribute a pair, and I thought about it. But I couldn't get past the kind of gross, incest vibe that gave me."" She looked carefully over my shoulder, apparently Nora and Lara were confering before my girl inspected my bondage and body writing. Her voice dropped to a whisper.

""But to be honest big sister, the gross, incest vibe I get from domming you, makes me kind of wet."" I suprised myself by whispering back. ""You domming me gets me wet, too, little sister, don't tell the others."" For a minute she gave me that lustful look she gave me when I was Ari's slave. This time I wasn't grossed out, but kind of...horny and excited.

Then she got that sweet, friendly smile that really lit up her eyes, and kissed my forehead quickly. ""It'll be our secret, big sis."" Then she proceeded to skillfully pack my mouth with my crew's panties. I kept my mouth obediently open and followed any order she gave to make my Sibling Mistress's task either. I was suprised at how fervently my wish was one of the pairs she was packing my mouth with was her own...they could even be dirty...that would be...so...incesty...and smoking hot.

Sandy got a decently tight pack that really shut me up to a few mmmphs, but wasn't too uncomfortable, considering....I was a fucking forcibly silenced helot. Again.

Sandy asked me a few questions about breathing, which I mmmphed once for yes to, twice for no to. ""I know that the panties will dry out your mouth fast, so on your first water break, we'll replace them with a nerf ball so you don't dehydrate. Lara, you can inspect her hood and gag now.""

My beautiful Desi princess had been inspecting my bonds, now she came around to assess my hood and gag while Sandy moved out of her way. She'd come along way in her BDSM skills. I could tell by the adjustments she made and the questions she asked me.

Then suddenly her eyes got hard and mean. ""You sure seemed to be getting cozy with Mistress Sandy, you nasty little minx. Something I should know about? She's your own sister, you sicko pervert!"" She whispered this harshly, glaring at me.

I just stared back at her wide eyed and afraid. The understated homoerotic tension with my little sister was discomfiting enough. If my Desi love could pick up on it, and was jealous...it could get...rough.

Then she broke into a loving smile and gently caressed my hooded left cheek with her right. ""Sweetie! Relax, I'm just jerking your chain! I'm not jealous, I actually think it's cute and sexy the way you two seem to be bonding...almost like you being a submissive to her again is helping you let down your defenses and actually heal."" I wasn't nervous or frightened anymore, just genuinely suprised that Lara and Sandy have similar insights about how me subbing voluntarily might be healing for me.

Now her right hand circled around my waist and squeezed my ass aggressively. Her smile turned into a lustful and predatory leer. ""Truth is, I kind of like you as the submissive one. Maybe I'll keep it that way, even once this is over. I might let you be in charge every now and then...if you ask Mistress Lara...really nicely for the privilige.""

I should have been angry at her presumptuous attitude...but I was just horny...Mistress Lara....you're making me so wet....please take your slave anyway you want her. I started breathing heavily through my nose, and getting embarrassingly musky, if I could smell it, so could my lover, sister, and protege. At the moment I didn't care. Lara squeezed my ass harder as she pulled me to her aggressively, our faces less then a centimeter apart. We'd have been kissing passionately if I wasn't gagged.

Then a voice broke the sexual tension. ""Oh, Fuck's sake, can't you save it for tonight girls?  Boss Bitch is always pinging on Sarah and I for getting too hot and heavy during working hours, and you make us watch you two nasty little lezzes play grab ass on the clock!"" Nora hollered at us.

I felt irritated at the little bitch, but Lara smiled and backed up. She put a hand on my chest above my breasts. ""Nora's right, no personal sexy on the clock. Tonight, little slave, you're submitting to me. End of discussion."" I was wetter than ever. I would have said ""Yes, Mistress Lara."" if I hadn't been so thoroughly gagged with panties.

Then a knock sounded on the door. Lara looked puzzled and asked ""Did anyone text?"" Sandy answered, just as confused. ""I didn't receive one, Nora?"" Nora sounded just as baffled when she replied ""nope.""

Lara moved to open the door. Standing in the door glaring at me in soul freezing anger over Lara's shoulder was Top Domme Mistress Layla Vasquez. My first inkling something was up besides her not giving my dommes a heads up was she was in full domme regalia, the outfit she used when she was fully exercising her authority over Constance.


She has a black peaked cap on her head, she's wearing a black silver studded crop top, and she's got a black knee length skirt on, with a suggestion of black fishnets underneath. And she has a nasty, braided red and black flogger in her right hand.  As Lara steps aside the Hispanic domme yells ""Eyes forward, Slave Loser Girl! You're at attention, thousand yard stare you pathetic little gimp! Do you ever learn?! My first day as top domme and my bottom slave gets two days of remedial training at the Queen Of Mean's compound! You better knock the rust off, fast, slave!""

She pauses to catch her breath and calm down. ""I've decided to personally escort you to your class, to try and keep you out of anymore trouble. Mistress Sandy and Mistress Nora will meet us there and make sure you learn everything Mistress Kealoha and Mistress Dao have to teach you. Don't worry girls, I'm not mad at you, just our little girl gimp here. Slave Loser Girl, get out here and face the wall under the camera so we can watch you, hurry up! I need to confer with Mistresses Sandy, Nora and Lara, then I'll take you to class!""

Lara has moved out of the way so Layla has no obstructions while ripping into me. Now Mistress Layla stands aside for me, I move as fast as I can to the wall, fearing a swat from her flogger. None is forthcoming.

As I hear the door slamming shut behind me as I center my nose on the wall, I wonder just what this two days of remediation will be....

Sandy's Perspective 

My first question as soon as the door slams closed on my sister's nude butt is ""Remediation?"" Layla takes a deep breath, relaxes her posture, and drops the Drill Sergeant act. ""Actually, it's a test for Mary's promotion to Alpha slave in Queen Of Mean's compound. She has to demonstrate she can ""lead, mold and train a bottom slave of her choice to Queen Of Mean's  standards."" That's a direct quote from their qualification standard for Alpha slaves.

Nora's asks ""Who decided it would be Sheila?"" Layla looked at her pointedly. ""Mary got to choose. You were her first choice, but she was told you're unavailable while domming. She was disappointed, Stacy told me, but cheered up when she was told Sheila was available, said that was even better, since Sheila let ""that little junkyard dog bitch"" slip her leash.""

Nora winced, visibly shaken. I knew how much her conscience had been bothering her for how excessive her cruelty was to Mary when she was a sub. It was a double blow because she knew Mary would probably take as much of her anger as she could on Sheila, for what Nora did.

Layla saw it and knew the source. ""Buck up kid, we all made mistakes we regret when Dave demoted Mary. Sheila should have stepped in, but so should I, when you started hanging out with Daci and bullying Mary excessively. I'm sure I would have been her third choice if I was available to sub.""

""We need to focus on the present. We know Queen Of Mean's standards for slaves are a lot tougher than ours. I heard from Sarah that Mary can be a vicious domme, especially when her emotions are involved. So we need to get Sheila used to stricter standards, while still having the backbone to let QOM's crew know we'll stand up for her if they go to far, even on their turf.""

Nora was silent, sadly looking at the camera  focused on Sheila with her hooded head patiently facing the wall, while her anxiety about her remediation had to be through the roof. I sat beside her, knowing in some ways Sheila was the only real big sister Nora ever had, her siblings belittled and abused her.

I put my arm around Nora. ""Come on blondie, I love her too, and I hate having to treat her like this."" A little fib, it was kinda hot, but Sheila has suffered so much, I hated making her endure more indignity. 
But we had to. How to pep talk Nora into it?

Then, inspiration struck. ""My last Master in Ari's service...Brian...bought me a box set of the first season of Perseverance, and let me watch it when I was done with my chores. I fell in love with the show, and all of you, I felt I knew you before I even met you."" I realized Lara and Layla were staring at me, held as rapt by my story as Nora obviously was.

""You know the one thing I hated at first about it? The interviews at the end where she sat between you and Sarah, wearing her dumb hat, her arms around the two of you. I was so jealous when she called you two ""her girls"" and talked about how proud she was of both of you. I felt like she abandoned me.""

""I realized the truth was, I abandoned her when I didn't tell my parents I thought Sheila was being held against her will, and all her snarky  replies on Social Media were Ari trying to isolate her from family and friends. I suspected something was wrong before Ari even showed her to me tied up. Instead I lied to my parents and joined in her torment, all over my petty jealousy that girly Sheila was always the favorite over tomboy Sandy.""

Nora looked at me quizically, wondering where I was going with this. ""I abandoned Sheila, but she didn't abandon me. I saw that humiliation video of the chariot race, and that cunt Emily using her as a weapons platform against you guys. She did that...for me. If I was her I wouldn't have done it for some traitor ass little sister. But that's the kind of person Sheila is. Rough around the edges, but good at heart.""

""Even after she literally fought to save me after Ari's double cross, the first thing I do is punch her because I was scared for Logan, the boy I escaped with who was injured. And what does she do?She gets me a nice room at her workplace, has her boss hire the best medical team to nurse me back to health. Gets me a job so I can start having my own money. Shares her wonderful friend group with me, makes me feel included.""

""Now she needs her little sister to step up, make some hard choices, to save her life's work, and the futures of this wonderful second family that adopted me. This time, I'm going to be there for her, even if it means being harsh on her in the short run. Connor sisters to the end this time. But we need the help of our other sisters, all of them."" I looked pointedly at Lara and Layla who nodded. Then I looked back at Nora, who looked really touched I saw her as family.

I held out my hand and said. ""For Sheila."" Lara and then Layla clasped hands over mine, saying. ""For Sheila."" Nora was the last, but her voice sounded steady when she said ""For Sheila."" Good.

After we dropped our hands, Layla said ""If that's settled, we need to go over her domme plan for the next three days before I escort her to class. Basically tomorrow and the day after she's Alpha Mary's bottom slave to train on QOM's compound. 
The last day, she'll be the Kitchen Slave under Kitchen Manager Jules. She'll be under the direct supervision of a ""Mistress Brianna"" the newest hire and youngest member of the kitchen staff.""

I raised a hand. ""Does this Mistress Brianna, and kitchen Manager Jules for that matter, have any prior domme experience?"" Layla looked at me grimly. ""No, Constance and Sara are giving them a crash course as we speak. I'm going to have Constance as their ""advisor"" while Sheila is their Kitchen Slave. She's the most experienced domme, and a good teacher, I think she's best qualified to make sure two rookie dommes don't hurt Sheila.""

I sat back with a sigh. Poor Sheila, we'd keep her safe, but her dignity was about to take some major hits. I'm glad I knew Dave wouldn't let this go past three days, he'd get it in writing. I looked at my practically naked sister, nose against the wall on the laptop screen. Sorry, Sheila. But if I have to punk you again, I'm gonna have a little fun...

1g1wcv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthysupplement_/comments/1g1wcv3/nagano_tonic_my_unexpected_weight_loss_journey/,Nagano Tonic: My Unexpected Weight Loss Journey!,"So, here I am, sharing something I never thought I‚Äôd be talking about‚Äîweight loss. Like most people, I‚Äôve had my fair share of challenges. I wasn‚Äôt always overweight, but as life caught up with me‚Äîcollege, job, stress, sitting all day‚Äîthose extra pounds began sneaking up on me.

A few months back, I decided it was time to get serious about my health. I tried everything: calorie counting, hitting the gym, cutting out carbs (goodbye, pasta‚ÄîI miss you), but nothing really stuck. Then, one day, I stumbled upon something pretty random that ended up making a huge difference. It‚Äôs called Nagano Tonic. Let me break down my journey with it.

**How I Discovered It**

It all started when my friend, Jessica, who I hadn‚Äôt seen in months, showed up to our weekend brunch looking absolutely amazing. I‚Äôm talking glowing skin, slimmer waistline‚Äîthe whole deal. When I asked her what she was doing differently, she told me about this herbal supplement she‚Äôd been using called Nagano Tonic I was skeptical at first‚Äîthere‚Äôs a ton of weight-loss stuff out there, and most of it doesn‚Äôt work or leaves you jittery. But Jess was adamant it was different.

[Nagano Tonic](https://preview.redd.it/kxn5lr3en9ud1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=907edf73ee7cd6b7539588102db6c33153a1a95f)

She shared how the tonic isn‚Äôt just about shedding pounds; it‚Äôs about balancing your metabolism, reducing cravings, and boosting energy. And trust me, I needed all the help I could get in those departments! After some research and seeing how happy Jess was, I decided to give it a go.

**The Taste That Surprised Me**

I‚Äôm not a fan of most health drinks, so I was bracing myself for something chalky or bitter. But when my first bottle of Nagano arrived, I was genuinely surprised by the taste. It‚Äôs this refreshing mix of herbs and natural spices that almost felt like I was treating myself instead of punishing myself with another weight loss supplement. It became part of my morning routine‚Äîlike an energy boost that didn‚Äôt require chugging down bitter green smoothies or endless cups of coffee.

**The Ingredients That Make a Difference**

What really sold me on Nagano Tonic was the ingredients. This isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill supplement filled with chemicals you can‚Äôt pronounce. It has green tea extract for metabolism, Garcinia Cambogia for reducing cravings (goodbye, late-night snack attacks), and other natural ingredients like Mangosteen and Camu Camu that help with digestion and energy.

Oh, and Ashwagandha‚Äîthis herb is a game changer. I‚Äôd heard about it before because it‚Äôs used in Ayurvedic medicine to manage stress, and let me tell you, it works. Not only did I feel more relaxed, but it also helped with those stress-induced cravings that hit when I‚Äôm overworked. I wasn't reaching for chips or cookies as often, which was huge for me.

**How It Helped Me**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîNagano isn‚Äôt some magic potion. It doesn‚Äôt melt fat overnight, and it doesn‚Äôt make you drop pounds just by sipping it while binging Netflix (trust me, I tried that part). But what it does do is make weight loss feel manageable and, dare I say, enjoyable.

In the first couple of weeks, I noticed a huge reduction in my cravings. Normally, I‚Äôd snack constantly‚Äîespecially in the afternoons. But with this tonic, I felt fuller for longer, and when I did eat, I felt satisfied more quickly. It gave me that little extra push I needed to stick to healthier meals without feeling deprived.

And energy? Let‚Äôs just say my workouts started to improve, too. Before using Nagano, I‚Äôd drag myself to the gym, but afterward, I had this natural boost that made my morning runs more enjoyable (or at least less of a chore).

**The Long-Term Benefits**

What sets Nagano Tonic apart from all the other things I‚Äôve tried is its focus on sustainability. It‚Äôs not about losing weight super fast and then gaining it all back. It‚Äôs about helping you build healthier habits. For me, it was a huge mindset shift‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt just thinking about the scale but how I felt overall.

Over time, I lost around 15 pounds, and I feel like a new person. But more than the number on the scale, what mattered was how this tonic helped me feel better. I had more energy to tackle my workday, my digestion improved, and I wasn‚Äôt constantly craving junk food.

**Is It Worth It?**

For me, the answer is 100% yes. It wasn‚Äôt just the weight loss‚Äîit was the fact that I started feeling more in control of my health. Plus, the fact that it‚Äôs all-natural (no weird chemicals) made me feel good about what I was putting into my body. And the best part? If you‚Äôre not happy after giving it a try, they offer a 180-day money-back guarantee. So, there‚Äôs basically no risk.

**If you‚Äôre like me and have tried everything to lose weight but haven‚Äôt found anything that works long-term, give Nagano Tonic a shot. I‚Äôm really glad I did‚Äîit turned out to be the missing piece of my health puzzle. üå±‚ú® CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE FROM THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE**¬†-¬†[https://naganotonic.com/](https://freezegluco.com/Naganoleanbodytonic.html)",1,1728724988.0,healthysupplement_,0,1.0,False

I guess I would have to go to the ER, further crowding it. I understand why Shopper's ended their 24 hours...theft was rampant, it was not a safe place for a pharmacist (or anyone) to be. I'm thinking though that a pharmacy that was JUST a pharmacy (like the Medicine Shoppe) that had a double door set up...customer opens the outer door, shows ID to a camera in order to be buzzed through the second door...or something like that...would do well here and be SO welcome. It would relieve some pressure at the ER. Thoughts? Any ER staff here who can comment on the number of people who show up at night just needing a medication refill?

‚ÄúRepresentative, can I get a word?‚Äù  
‚ÄúRep Mayers, how do you respond to the allegations made against you?‚Äù  
‚ÄúRepresentative, is there any truth to the statements floating around on the ‚Äònet?‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone, please.‚Äù Representative Mayers stood at the top of the stairs to the Chambers with a calm and collected look. ‚ÄúI was merely doing my duty. The Captain‚Äôs actions went beyond his authority, even the compromise by my colleagues admit that. My goal here was simply to ensure that in the future anyone who does make first contact and establishes communication with another race does so in the proper manner - by contacting their local government to proceed. Whether that is Sol or Proxima, the concern is entirely about leaving the delicate and sensitive task of establishing cordial relations to experts.‚Äù

‚ÄúRepresentative.‚Äù A young man raised his microphone - and his voice - above the rest of the crowd. ‚ÄúFeed polls during the Commons session showed an overwhelming majority of the public opposes your actions and the persecution of the Captain. Even within your own district the support for your actions is below thirty percent - how do you justify taking action that your constituents don‚Äôt support?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have already explained the rationale behind my actions. My goal is to ensure that first contact in the future is done properly, by a trained group of diplomats and not by impassioned amateurs. Next question.‚Äù Mayers seethed inwardly but long practice in his position helped him maintain a cool demeanor despite it.

A young woman pushed forward and glared up at the Representative. ‚ÄúDo you have any comments to the accusations that you‚Äôre pursuing a vendetta of some sort against Captain Sherman? Will you continue to persecute him?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not. I found the Captain‚Äôs actions reprehensible, but I have no ill will towards him outside of that. His decision to save lives both on the derelict ship and on the station later on were commendable.‚Äù Having to praise Sherman‚Äôs actions was distasteful, but necessary. ‚ÄúMy concerns were solely on his decision to act as a representative for humanity without prior approval and authorization. Mistakes made during the initial contact period could be catastrophic, and while the Captain was obviously lucky he did as well as he did, I cannot stress enough that no others should attempt to emulate him. The single most important thing to do in any situation like this is to defer to the government.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have my secretary issue a release to each of your sites.‚Äù Mayer waved away further questions and walked down the steps briskly - the ushers for the Chamber shoving the reporters aside as he reached the bottom where a courier car was waiting. He slipped into the car quickly and once the door was firmly shut, released a slow sigh of irritation.

‚ÄúThose goddamn stupid fuckers.‚Äù He complained. ‚ÄúThey have no fucking idea what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

A huge-eyed face stared at him from across the courier vehicle. The young man sitting there looked nervous to be in his presence, and Mayer gave him a sardonic smile. ‚ÄúAnd you must be the new aide that Bishop Heller sent over.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yes! Yes sir. I mean, yes Representative.‚Äù The young man stammered out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to, ah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. The Bishop has already filled me in quite thoroughly. All of this was timed quite poorly but that's not your fault.‚Äù Mayers bit back the urge to snap at the young man. The aide's appointment had been scheduled months ahead, before anyone had known this would happen. ‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs been a staunch ally for us for quite some time now, correct?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. In fact they just named the newest temple over in Nuevo Nevada after him.‚Äù The young man nodded vigorously.

‚ÄúWell don‚Äôt expect me to be giving you the easy jobs just because of him. You‚Äôre going to have to work hard under me. But I promise you that if you work well you‚Äôll rise far.‚Äù Mayers pulled out a small pocket-board and unfolded it into a larger quickboard. He handed it over to the young man. ‚ÄúTo begin with, I‚Äôm going to have you helping with the statement we‚Äôre going to be releasing about Sherman. I‚Äôm going to dictate into the board but I‚Äôd like you to review and give me a younger generation‚Äôs impression of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶ I mean, yes. I can definitely do that.‚Äù The young man looked as though he wanted to say more but was hesitating as he took the board.

‚ÄúWas there something you wanted to say?‚Äù Mayers eyes narrowed dangerously - surely if the child was referred by the Bishop then he shouldn‚Äôt have any dangerous leanings!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I know the scripture, I know the goal. I understand trying to protect people. What I don‚Äôt really understand is why we‚Äôre going after Captain Sherman right now. It seems like the damage is already done.‚Äù The young man answered quickly, and Mayers softened his gaze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right about that, but there‚Äôs still much we can do in terms of damage control. For one, we have to make an example out of him. It‚Äôs bad enough that he succeeded despite our efforts, to have him unpunished sets an awful precedent. We have to discourage others from trying to do the same thing.‚Äù Mayers responded.

‚ÄúHow were we trying to stop him?‚Äù The young man asked with interest. ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not like we had anyone on his ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat curiosity is going to get you in trouble.‚Äù Mayers smiled, then shook his head. ‚ÄúBut then I was that curious at your age too. We weren‚Äôt necessarily trying to stop him personally or directly. More trying to control any situation that arises. We can‚Äôt prevent contact - what happens, happens too far away from us to stop. So instead it's vital that we control what happens afterwards. Our associates have thoroughly filled out the USN diplomatic corps and exploration leagues. If Sherman had done the correct thing? If he‚Äôd contacted us and we could have sent out OUR people to establish relations? Then everything would have been fine. We could have sabotaged relations in a subtle and careful manner, and safeguarded humanity for generations.‚Äù

The young man nodded, then tilted his head. ‚ÄúBut Sherman isn‚Äôt even a Sol citizen. What about Proxima? How can we control things out there?‚Äù

‚ÄúProxima isn‚Äôt a superpower yet. Not like we are.‚Äù Mayers answered with a derisive sneer. ‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt dare antagonize us by making contact without us - the hawks in the Commons and the Rulers would immediately push for War. They‚Äôre already terrified of becoming obsolete by Proxima, if they felt that was happening any faster than it already is they‚Äôd push to act. No, Proxima isn‚Äôt a concern yet. And hopefully by the time they are we‚Äôll have more thoroughly infiltrated their side of things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù The young man had a thoughtful, pensive look and Mayers inwardly approved.

‚ÄúFor now, our goals are twofold. We couldn‚Äôt punish Sherman like we‚Äôd hoped - though at least the loss of billions of credits will be a strong enough blow to look as though we have. You and I are going to be insanely busy for a long while. I burned nearly all of my political capital trying to drum up support to go after Sherman, and that means we‚Äôre going to be selling favors. As many as we can as often as we can to try to regain all the support I‚Äôve lost. I can‚Äôt go after Sherman anymore, that‚Äôd be political suicide - so I have to rebuild my base.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the other goal?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go after Sherman.‚Äù Mayers said, and gave a cold smile. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not the only one in the Church who has power. I use my power and influence to affect the government and its direction - as much as any one single person can, that is. However, other faithful have their uses as well. It may be something as simple as listening in for any bits of valuable info that might be spoken aloud. Or it could be punishing Sherman and the freaks in a much more‚Ä¶ direct and permanent manner.‚Äù

The young man looked taken aback by that, and Mayers chuckled in response. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look like you approve?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ I understand the goal, but that just seems‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brutal and lacks our usual subtlety, I agree.‚Äù Mayers gestured out the window at the terrain as they went. ‚ÄúBut if subtle and coordinated efforts don‚Äôt bear fruit, then we WILL do what we must. In order to safeguard our people from their mistaken beliefs we can do no less, after all.‚Äù

The young man straightened up with a renewed look of determination on his face, and Mayers stifled a laugh. ‚ÄúStill, that duty is on others. You won‚Äôt be called to meet Him directly while you work for me, just to help me spread our influence. Speaking of which, it‚Äôs time to dictate that statement. I can‚Äôt just dismiss the issue entirely, that would be too out of character, but I can try to deflect a bit.‚Äù

Mayers thought for a minute while the young man shifted nervously in the seat, then began. ‚ÄúFrom the office of Representative Deacon Mayers. Today the Chamber of Commons has deemed that Captain Alexander Sherman is to be lightly punished for his actions undertaken in the Perseus arm whilst meeting with unknown intelligent species in our Galaxy. While I cannot condone his illegal and unethical actions of acting without the authorization of any governmental body, I consider the Chamber‚Äôs actions to be final. I would like to stress here and now that I do not find fault in any who engage in exploration of space - so long as discoveries of this nature are properly reported to relevant authorities FIRST so that they can act accordingly. In addition the Captain‚Äôs other actions - such as the humanitarian efforts he engaged in while rescuing stranded spacefarers and the evacuation of children from a space station - are evidence of the best qualities of Humanity. Empathy, compassion, and a willingness to step up and give aid despite the severity of the situation‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äî--

‚Äú... And so we look forward to a long and benevolent future together.‚Äù

Trix finished up her introductory speech. It was nearly but not exactly the same as the speech she gave in Proxima, and once she finished she stepped back and off to the side.

President Wells immediately stepped up to the podium to address the public. ‚ÄúOn the behalf of the United Solar Federation, I President Jeffrey Wells do henceforth declare that on this day, the 24th of September, to be a Federational holiday. On this day a new era has dawned for all of mankind, and today will forever be remembered and marked as the day when the first non-human intelligence greeted mankind on its birthplace with peace and friendship.‚Äù

He paused for several moments as he looked out upon the Chamber of the Commons. In reality he knew his face was being broadcast to the entirety of Sol and the local system, with over fifteen billion humans in residence throughout. He wondered briefly whether or not Trix knew how widespread her speech just now was. It‚Äôs easy to perform in front of a small crowd or in front of cameras - harder in front of a massive crowd or when you actually know how many faces are on the other side of those cameras.

‚ÄúThere will be a great many things to do in the coming days. Due to the time pressure present, our guests will be spending much of the next month experiencing the wonders of our homeworld before returning to their own. While they do so myself and the USF Government will be hard at work ensuring that when they return they will be accompanied by representatives of Sol, as we establish the first USF Embassy on a non-human planet. I cannot say with any certainty what the coming months and years will hold for our people - there will be surprises both good and bad. However we will face them united as we always have and in the end I am sure this will be a monumental achievement that will serve to better us now and forever more.‚Äù

The President raised a hand and stepped back, and the small group disappeared through the grand doors behind them leaving the speaker to step up and address the Chamber. Alex and Sophie had declined to go out alongside Trix (Alex due to trying to distance himself from his recent ‚Äòinfamy‚Äô and Sophie because Alex didn‚Äôt want to go out either), so instead they met her back in the prep area located just behind the Chamber‚Äôs main entrance.

‚ÄúWell that all seemed to go quite well.‚Äù Alex commented as Trix and the President joined them.

‚ÄúIt absolutely did. I think the speech was exactly what we needed right now.‚Äù President Wells beamed at the group. ‚ÄúPublic opinion is high. People aren‚Äôt set in their opinions yet so it‚Äôs easier to shift it. The biggest factor in our favor is that the species of Perseus don‚Äôt know where we are - fears of the Tanjeeri or other hostile actions are pretty easy to deflect with that. In all, we made an excellent impression I think.‚Äù

Alex bit his lip, as he fought to keep the snarky comment that came to mind. The President was helping them, and right now his obsession with public opinion was working in their favor. ‚ÄúEven if they did know, which they don't, their FTL tech is different than ours. Nobody from Perseus could reach us without using D-Space for years to come with their systems.‚Äù

The President nodded, then glanced at Sophie. ‚ÄúSo now that the trial‚Äôs over and the introduction has been done, it‚Äôs time to start talking about the future. Obviously we‚Äôll be sending a small group of ships with you to establish a local embassy on Kiveyt. What are your plans and what else will you need from us? Since we‚Äôre on a ticking clock now, I want to try to get any political maneuvering out of the way early on.‚Äù

Alex glanced between Trix and Sophie, and shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôd be willing to give up a few D-Space capable craft?‚Äù

That caught President Wells off guard. ‚ÄúI, uh. I can‚Äôt myself, but I can certainly begin the process to put it before the Chambers‚Ä¶‚Äù

Alex sighed, and waved a hand back and forth. ‚ÄúSorry, not fair to bring that up, but right now that‚Äôs the biggest sticking point. That damned agreement the Bunters made to steal away the in-system resources means that the Avekin need FTL to get access to any significant amount of resources of their own.‚Äù

The President sighed, and shook his head. ‚ÄúKeplite control is the single biggest political hot potato between us and Proxima. Granting access to a brand new species right out the gate is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs not IMPOSSIBLE but it‚Äôs the closest thing to impossible I can think of.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs more or less what Proxima said as well. Chartering a mining company is the next option. I‚Äôd normally just turn to Terrafault, but since it looks like the funds I‚Äôd use to pay for it just dried up I may have to beg for aid from our governments. Once we can get raw materials in the system we just need fabbers to process them. And lastly they'll need some in-system ships to defend the whole thing if the Tanjeeri decide to come investigating.‚Äù Alex hooked his thumbs into his pockets as he spoke.

‚ÄúThat much shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to try to pressure the council into. A goodwill gesture of some older fleet hulls with the Keplite cores stripped out will be an easy sell, since we always have more waiting to be recycled than the yards can keep up with. If they can‚Äôt be used against us and aren‚Äôt useful as an, errrr‚Ä¶‚Äù The president glanced at Alex with an odd, almost ashamed look on his face. ‚ÄúAs a counter balance to the Proximan fleets,‚Äù he finally settled on, ‚Äúthen there‚Äôs no real downside to using them as political capital.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we were leaving the Proxima Council kinda hinted towards that as well.‚Äù Alex nodded. ‚ÄúIn all my discussions with Kyshe - she‚Äôs one of their leaders - I tried not to promise any specifics of support, but we agreed that the best goal to shoot for was just simple self sufficiency. Right now huge amounts of equipment is imported from the Bunters. They can produce a fair amount locally but not in the numbers they‚Äôd need to break free from all Bunter trade.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we want to become a superpower.‚Äù Trix stepped into the conversation. It was still uncomfortable for her to speak up, but this was one of the topics that Amanda had helped coach her in and she WAS the Ambassador. ‚ÄúThe Bunters are trying to keep us reliant upon them. Simply being able to care for our people on our own without any other help is our primary goal.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reasonable one.‚Äù The President nodded. ‚ÄúIt sounds, though, like this could be a bit of an imbalanced situation though. I know that some of the factions of the Commons - the industrialists and commercialists - will be hesitant unless we can dangle some bait. I hate to use the phrase but I expect a hefty amount of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs in it for us‚Äô?‚Äù

Alex snorted, and smiled at that. ‚ÄúRight now, very little directly. However, my ship has a Terrafault corporate representative on it. And she was able to wrangle an agreement that‚Äôll be available to both Proxima and Sol - if we can provide the bartering materials to the Avekin, they can be used as an intermediary for Bunter goods.‚Äù

The President cocked his head at that. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting offer. What kind of goods exactly could we get our hands on?‚Äù

Trix cleared her throat - this was another topic that she‚Äôd been made to memorize. ‚ÄúWith what's currently on Kiveyt we can provide industrial mining equipment, computer and communications technology, agricultural equipment, and medical equipment. We also have a number of personal defense weapons and equipment that were imported. Those could all be reasonably replaced with Human goods and technology, allowing us to trade in those immediately. Beyond that, we would need to sit down and negotiate other options from the list of import materials that our planet can obtain.‚Äù Alex thought she sounded a bit mechanical reading off the list, but then he had been present much of the time she‚Äôd spent memorizing it. President Wells hadn‚Äôt, and lacked familiarity with Avekin phonics enough to recognize that she was ‚Äòreading a script‚Äô.

‚ÄúThat should be more than enough.‚Äù Wells assured him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have my staff start writing up some proposals to be put before the Chambers. Thirty days is moving quick but since it‚Äôs their time limit I can pressure them more because of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good news. In the mean time, since we‚Äôre on a ticking clock we‚Äôre going to be prioritizing experiencing Terra directly.‚Äù Alex interjected. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of planet out there and I‚Äôd like to be able to show these two as much of it as we can while we‚Äôre here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, of course.‚Äù Jeffrey Wells beamed at that, and gestured around him grandly. ‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre already here on the Island, why don‚Äôt spend the rest of the day exploring here and we‚Äôll put you up in local ambassadorial suites? At no charge, of course.‚Äù

Alex nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a bad plan. Tomorrow though we‚Äôre heading straight to Atlantis first thing in the morning. It‚Äôs one of the places that‚Äôs always been on my wishlist. However, if I could beg a favor...‚Äù

The president immediately chuckled and gave the Captain a sly smile. ‚ÄúIs that a subtle hint?‚Äù

‚ÄúSubtle as a brick.‚Äù Alex grinned back. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to offer us your aid, I‚Äôm going to take full advantage.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, care to fill us in on your little joke there?‚Äù Trix said, crossing her arms in front of her. ‚ÄúSome of us don‚Äôt have a clue what the hell ‚ÄòAtlantis‚Äô is.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sealed-off environment.‚Äù Alex explained. ‚ÄúA hugely popular tourist attraction, but due to its nature they can‚Äôt let everyone in all at once. There‚Äôs usually a waiting list to get inside. I‚Äôd originally planned to try to bribe my way up to the top of the list‚Ä¶‚Äù his eyes immediately darted to Sophie who looked distinctly unhappy at the word ‚Äòbribe‚Äô, but otherwise said nothing. This wasn‚Äôt Farscope and she wasn‚Äôt security anymore. ‚ÄúBut since my reward is gone, it seems more prudent to rely on our new friend here to get us in.‚Äù

‚ÄúNormally, it‚Äôd be next to impossible to get you in within a month. Money or no.‚Äù The President gestured around him. ‚ÄúEven the Representatives can‚Äôt get in on a day‚Äôs notice. But given the company you keep‚Ä¶‚Äù He nodded at Trix. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine ANY city on the planet will be refusing you entry. Just in case though, I‚Äôll have one of my staff contact the port.‚Äù

‚ÄúI appreciate it.‚Äù Alex said honestly. ‚ÄúNow if you‚Äôll excuse us, I‚Äôm getting a bit hungry. You girls interested in a meal?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù Sophie responded instantly. ‚ÄúThe only thing they offered me back here while I waited was ‚ÄòCoffee‚Äô which tastes like aquis, and ‚Äòbagel‚Äô which were flavorless. I need something that doesn‚Äôt taste like mud.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like a plan.‚Äù Alex turned and, in a sudden moment of awkwardness attempted a shallow bow to the President. ‚ÄúThanks for all your help, uh‚Ä¶ Mr President sir. I probably misjudged you before.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink nothing of it. And please, call me Jeffrey.‚Äù The President laughed at the awkward bow, and offered Alex a firm handshake. ‚ÄúNow go feed your friends while I do what I do best.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. Thanks again.‚Äù Alex gave him a brief wave, then turned to Sophie. ‚ÄúWhat are you two in the mood for?‚Äù

‚ÄúMeat, obviously. Something with a strong flavor. Those bagel were like chewing on rope.‚Äù Sophie responded.

Trix jumped up slightly and spread her wings. ‚ÄúI want some of that cold cream we had on Nexus. I liked the sweetness!‚Äù

‚ÄúIce cream‚Äôs a dessert, not a meal.‚Äù Alex shook his head no. ‚ÄúI got distracted by the trial, but while we were flying out here I remember looking up a sandwich place‚Ä¶ delicatessen something or other. Let‚Äôs try there.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, I‚Äôm the ambassador! I should get to pick!‚Äù Trix complained as they walked away. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never as nice to me as my aunt‚Ä¶‚Äù

The trio walked out of the prep area, out into the corridors leading outside the building. Not one of them paid much attention to the young man who‚Äôd been near them listening in on their conversation. Mayers‚Äô new aide watched them go while he pulled out his quickboard and prepared to send the Representative a message.

‚Äî--

‚ÄúJesus I thought you guys ordered that as a prank.‚Äù

The portly man stared in awe as Sophie took huge bites out of the sandwich. It was piled high with slices of meat, vegetables, drizzled with oil and vinaigrette and piled high with ultra-spicy sliced Yama peppers. The proprietor of the shop himself had made it when the order came through, and he didn‚Äôt actually see who had ordered until after he‚Äôd finished.

Now he watched impressed as Sophie and Trix hungrily devoured their massive sandwiches.

‚ÄúNot a prank, nope. They don‚Äôt get the burn but they get all the rest of the flavor.‚Äù Alex took a big bite of his own sandwich, a fresh-off-the-stove cheesesteak that prompted him to immediately take a swig of water. Their sandwiches were loaded with spicy heat - his was just plain hot. He set it down and watched it steam slightly in the air as he waited for it to cool a bit.

‚ÄúGuess you guys were hungry, eh?‚Äù Big Dan‚Äôs Deli Shop was a local favorite amongst the representatives and their staff, and he had a reputation for being able to provide big meals for reasonable prices. Dan stared at the trio as Sophie and Trix were wolfing down their subs. ‚ÄúThey, uh, really don‚Äôt feel it?‚Äù

Alex shook his head. ‚ÄúCapsaicin doesn‚Äôt register as pain to them like it would to us. Still a potent spice, and they love to eat it on everything. Also sugar and sweets. Not as good at tasting sour and savory flavors though.‚Äù

Sophie paused between huge bites of her sandwich. ‚ÄúHe does know he can just talk to us directly, right?‚Äù

""Not without a visor he can‚Äôt.‚Äù Alex retorted. ‚ÄúDo you have a visor, man? Cuz there‚Äôs no way they can use a breathmask to translate while we eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh? Oh. Oh yeah.‚Äù The big man reddened and dashed back behind the counter. He rummaged around in a drawer before pulling out a visor - an old, bulky model that used a plastic display instead of the holographic one that Alex and the Avekin were using. It took him a couple minutes to fiddle with it before it switched on and glowed slightly in front of his face. ‚ÄúOkay, uh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll take a minute. I haven‚Äôt used this in a couple years, so it‚Äôs got some updates‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dan walked out to the table and Alex had resumed his meal. He set it down and chewed thoughtfully before flashing the man a thumbs up. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ man, that‚Äôs excellent. I see why you‚Äôre popular with the guys up in the Chamber.‚Äù

Dan flushed with pleasure at the compliment and spread his hands wide. ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm glad to hear you like it. We get a lot of visitors from throughout the system but, uh, this is something new. I‚Äôm pretty excited to hear what aliens think of my meals.‚Äù

Trix set down the sandwich - what little remained of it, at least - and sat back in her chair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely delicious. And what‚Äôs this drink?‚Äù

Dan wasn‚Äôt used to using the visor in real-time and it took him a moment as he read the translation scanning through. ‚ÄúOh man, that‚Äôs a relief. The drink? It‚Äôs root beer. A lot of families come by, so one of the local breweries on the island makes their own local recipe.‚Äù

Alex took a sip of his own cup. ‚ÄúInteresting. It‚Äôs a bit creamier than the store brands we got back on Nexus Station.‚Äù

Sophie set down her sandwich and took a huge gulp of the soda, before her face lit up immediately. ‚ÄúThis is amazing!‚Äù She took another more sedate sip, before she started picking up some of the Yama peppers that had fallen from the sandwich onto the wrapper and popping them into her mouth.

‚ÄúBetween you and me,‚Äù Alex said conspiratorially to Dan, ‚Äúit‚Äôs mostly the sugar that appeals to them. But it‚Äôs still a good drink.‚Äù

Dan watched in amazement as Sophie casually chewed on the hottest peppers his shop had stocked. Despite Alex‚Äôs earlier statements it was hard to see someone just snacking on those peppers so casually when he himself had to be careful and wear gloves when using them. Yama peppers were artificially bred, a cultivar of multiple different pepper breeds to maximize their savory flavor - and their intense, intense heat. Dan had a single bottle of them and this order alone had used it up all at once.

‚ÄúI gotta get a photo of this. Big Dan‚Äôs Deli Shop, where even Aliens love to eat!‚Äù The big man reached up to the visor before his hand froze an inch away. ‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ I mean, if that‚Äôs okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúGirls? Do you mind if our host here takes a photo of you two so that he can brag about our visit to people who come here in the future?‚Äù At least the big guy had asked. That was more polite than the countless people who‚Äôd snapped images of them walking around Nexus. There were thousands of those floating around the Proximan 'net, though most people found them dull compared to the images he himself had released.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine with it.‚Äù Trix said nonchalantly, while she lifted up her sandwich and indulged in more of it. ‚ÄúAlex.‚Äù Sophie glanced down though, ignoring her meal for a minute.

‚ÄúGo ahead and take some snaps then.‚Äù Alex gestured vaguely, and reached down to pick up his own meal and dig in with another juicy bite. ‚ÄúAlex.‚Äù Sophie repeated.

‚ÄúMmmm?‚Äù Alex glanced over at noticed that Sophie was frozen in her seat, staring off to the side of the table. He stood up and glanced down - and saw a young girl, a toddler who had walked over to the table and was now standing there silently, gazing up at the alien with huge brown eyes.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù Sophie said uncertainly. The tiny child barely came up to the knee of the huge alien, but she seemed entirely unaware as she gazed up at the unfamiliar sight. ‚ÄúWhat does she want?‚Äù

Alex stared down briefly in surprise, then swallowed his bite of cheesesteak and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúHey there kiddo. Where‚Äôs your parents?‚Äù

The little girl‚Äôs eyes darted over to Alex for a moment, then back to stare up at Sophie. Her arms came up and extended towards the white-feathered alien and she made a soft ‚ÄòUh!‚Äô sound.

‚ÄúAlex, what does she want?‚Äù Sophie was uncertain as she regarded the tiny human. She‚Äôd seen plenty of human children from afar - in their little wheeled buggies, pushed around by parents or following along autonomously. Sitting in special chairs next to tables at restaurants. But this was the first time she‚Äôd been so close, and this child obviously had something in mind when approaching the Avekin.

‚ÄúUhm. If I had to guess I think she wants a hug? Or for you to pick her up?‚Äù Alex stared down at the kid - being so close to such an unfamiliar person seemed like it‚Äôd be scary but the little girl showed zero signs of trepidation or caution as she made another ‚ÄúUh!‚Äù noise and pushed her hands out further. ‚ÄúJust pick her up from under her arms.‚Äù He stood up and began scanning around the room for any parents that might be looking for a wandered-off child.

Sophie very slowly, very hesitantly, and very carefully reached down and placed her hands on the child‚Äôs sides. The little girl immediately put her arms down as she was lifted up into the air and brought in close to the Avekin. Sophie‚Äôs heart beat rapidly as she realized the tiny thing weighed almost nothing at all and she immediately began to worry if she was hurting the young girl until her arms raised up again and pushed out towards the alien.

As Sophie pulled her in closer, the little girl‚Äôs head immediately pushed down against Sophie‚Äôs chest. The sight was intensely surreal - the young child, unknown and unbidden warming up instantly to a stranger, an alien at that. Alex found himself gawping at the spectacle before his mouth curled up into a delighted smile.

‚ÄúOh dear lord that is adorable. That is so *goddamn* cute. You made a friend!‚Äù He gushed as Trix stared wide-eyed at her aunt, who was obviously immensely uncomfortable with the situation. This tiny creature had come up to her and was now pressed close for seemingly no reason at all.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what do I‚Ä¶‚Äù Sophie‚Äôs eyes darted around wildly as she found herself in the throes of a panic. She couldn‚Äôt just shove this creature away or drop it - it was so tiny, so fragile. But she had no idea what to do. She had even less interaction with younger children than other Avekin her age due to spending so many years off-planet and this strange, unexpected situation was sending alarm bells throughout her system.

‚ÄúMindy? Mindy! Mindy where did you go?‚Äù A panicked woman rushed out of a hallway nearby, her head whipping around wildly while her eyes darted around the room. Alex immediately raised a hand high in the air, then pointed down at the young toddler who had taken an instant liking to the alien visitors.

‚ÄúMindy! Why on earth did you walk away?‚Äù The woman rushed over to the table and froze as she saw her daughter snuggling up against the massive alien. The unfamiliar sight of huge white wings and the strange feathered face caught her entirely off guard, as she took in the surreal scene.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ oh my god, I am so sorry‚Ä¶ I only looked away for a moment and she immediately bolted out of the room.‚Äù The woman carefully stepped forward and reached out for her daughter. The little girl turned her face away from the woman and Alex started shaking as he kept his laughter inside. He fought hard not to make his amusement and delight at the situation obvious, and failed miserably.

‚ÄúStop that. Stop it! If you‚Äôre going to do something, help me out here!‚Äù Sophie protested to him with a pained, unpleasant look on her face.

‚ÄúAhahaha‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm ahaha sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù Alex couldn‚Äôt keep from giggling between breaths as he watched the woman trying to coax her daughter away from the big feathery friend she‚Äôd found, while Sophie clearly was uncomfortable and wanted nothing more than to hand her over. Unfortunately the young girl had gotten a grip on Sophie‚Äôs shirt and was holding on tightly, turning her head away from her mother constantly.

It was all too much, and Alex began to laugh loudly as he moved over to help. Between Sophie, Alex, and the girl‚Äôs mother it took a full five minutes before they were able to return the toddler to her parent, and even then she kept making an ‚ÄòAh! Ah!‚Äô noise and reaching out for Sophie.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so so so so sorry! Really! She‚Äôs normally so sweet and well behaved!‚Äù The lady was bright red with embarrassment as she apologized over and over to the trio. ‚ÄúShe has a plush owl doll so maybe she just really, really likes birds‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently she absolutely loves them.‚Äù Alex had gotten over the worst of his chuckles and amusement when Sophie had pinched his arm in exasperation. And not lightly either.

‚ÄúReally, it‚Äôs OK. It was very‚Ä¶ unexpected but I understand she‚Äôs just a child.‚Äù Sophie kept protesting to the woman, incomprehensibly. Alex had to translate to her all of the Avekin‚Äôs words, as she stood there trying to keep her wriggling offspring under control.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs fine ma‚Äôam. There was no harm done and she was just curious and interested.‚Äù Alex didn‚Äôt translate verbatim but did his best to impress upon her that the issue wasn‚Äôt a major one. ‚ÄúHonestly I thought it was cute as hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just feel so bad, we interrupted your meal. I, uh. Saw you on the TV of course. I‚Äôm sure she did too.‚Äù Alex pulled a chair over for her to sit next to Trix, while the woman deftly handled her offspring. It was obvious from the way she kept the child in place that the pair was used to this.

‚ÄúWell if you hadn‚Äôt I‚Äôd have been even more surprised.‚Äù Alex joked. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt exactly kept a low profile since arriving.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just so surprised to see you here. I thought you‚Äôd be wandering around with, well, a huge security detail and tons of guards.‚Äù She remarked. ‚ÄúInstead you‚Äôre just sitting here in the restaurant out in the open and eating. It‚Äôs, uh, kind of strange to imagine such big important people just wandering around like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHonestly we kind of ducked out of the Chamber pretty quickly after the big introductory address. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs some security people rushing around trying to make big arrangements, but food takes precedence.‚Äù Alex had snuck in a few more bites of his sandwich, though it‚Äôd cooled a bit more than he would have liked. Sophie was digging back in now that she was free of the toddler‚Äôs grasp, and Trix had already finished her meal and was watching the child. Alex continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure eventually we‚Äôre going to get saddled with a security team - we certainly had our armed and armored shadows all over the place on Nexus Station. So what do you do here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in between jobs while I look after her. My husband is a technician who works on the Thermohaline generators under us. Oh, god, I haven‚Äôt introduced myself at all, have I? My name‚Äôs Angela, and this is‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMindy, I heard.‚Äù Alex reached out a hand with a smile to the little girl. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Mindy.‚Äù

She ignored the hand and instead wriggled around to watch Trix. Trix shook her wings slightly as the two locked eyes, and the little girl burbled with delight as she did so.

‚ÄúThermohaline? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù Sophie was licking the vinaigrette off of one of her fingers as she watched the little girl‚Äôs delight. Trix slowly flexed her wings out a bit - there wasn‚Äôt room to really spread them full in the restaurant, but there was room to push them out a bit and the girl was absolutely fascinated as she did so.

‚ÄúDeep, deep oceanic generators that operate based on currents.‚Äù Alex explained. ‚ÄúD-Space generators can produce a lot of power but require frequent trips into d-space to refuel them. And opening up a gravitic gateway in atmosphere would be‚Ä¶ very, very bad. So the bulk of planetary power is usually done via local sources like wind, water, and solar.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Kiveyt uses primarily solar and geothermal power.‚Äù Sophie nodded as the concept clicked.

‚ÄúConsidering the firelands are bordered by three separate Teffs I‚Äôm not surprised. From an energy standpoint that place is an energy goldmine.‚Äù Alex agreed. The firelands were EXTREMELY active with volcanic calderas, springs, ash plumes and magma fields. This made them inhospitable for long-term settlements but attractive for their energetic properties. The fact that they were completely deserted also made them more convenient for noisier activities, which was one reason why the races (with their incredibly loud aircars and constant cannon blasts) were held there instead of populated areas.

‚ÄúUhm. Firelands?‚Äù Angela looked quizzically at the aliens and Alex.

‚ÄúJust a region of their home planet that‚Äôs full of lava and heat. Good sources of energy.‚Äù Alex clarified. ‚ÄúWhen you get home look up Trix‚Äôs race on Kiveyt. I‚Äôm sure we dumped it into the local net so it should be easy to find.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù Angela promised. ‚ÄúAre, uh‚Ä¶ are they going to be back a lot?‚Äù

‚ÄúThese two? Probably not. I‚Äôm due for exile from Sol in a month‚Äôs time, and I‚Äôm their ride. But I would not be surprised if the Avekin start visiting here in the future. Might be a few years between trips, their homeworld is six THOUSAND light years away.‚Äù

Angela‚Äôs jaw dropped. ‚ÄúI knew they were far, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She shook her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane. How many ah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAvekin. Their race has a wider range of vocal sounds,‚Äù Alex stated the obvious since the woman hadn‚Äôt been able to understand a single word of their native language, ‚Äúso that‚Äôs the English designation.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many Avekin are there?‚Äù Angela‚Äôs natural curiosity was bubbling up now that she‚Äôd gotten over her mortification of her daughter‚Äôs actions. ‚ÄúAre they descended from birds?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot sure on the latter, but for the former there's about a billion. Personally I hope that number goes up as we cooperate and coordinate. They haven‚Äôt been treated the absolute best by their galactic neighbors, so it‚Äôs my hope that we‚Äôll be able to be a bit better in that regard.‚Äù Alex studied the toddler. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm being honest, they‚Äôre a lot like us. So much moreso than the other species we met. If even your daughter is fascinated‚Ä¶ it makes me that much more certain we‚Äôre going to get along really well.‚Äù

I grabbed the familiar, deeply yellow stained mug greedily, slurping at its contents with an unquenchable thirst. One by one, the cobwebs in my mind began to fade away, the caffeine doing its job well. This was my favorite part of waking up, having survived another night of tossing and turning, dreading the night terrors that came to me when my eyes closed. Because of this, I had become hopelessly addicted to coffee.

I did not sleep very well, and when I did it was more upsetting than insomnia. My dreams always filled with worlds of unspeakable horror, demons and ghouls tormenting me until the sun rose. I shuddered, holding the steaming drink close to my chest as I browsed news articles. It was the weekend, meaning I would begrudgingly go to mass and the family lunch that followed, but I truly dreaded tomorrow, as that would mean more endless spreadsheets and changing deadlines.

I started when I heard a slight, squeaking sound from in front of me, and glanced up to see a hellish face staring through my kitchen window. It looked like a woman, her hair pale, her face gaunt and frozen in a silent scream. She was scratching her hideously curved, yellow finger nails on the glass. I took a few deep breaths, despite my utter shock and fear, I knew this was just a hallucination, the leftovers from a fading nightmare. I blinked, and the face was gone.

This calls for more coffee. 

I got up, and refilled my mug with even more of the delicious drink, when a sudden banging sound caused me to drop the mug. I felt the boiling hot liquid scald my legs, heard the tinkling of it shatter on the tile as I whipped to look out the window. There was nothing there, just a handprint on the glass on the fading condensation. I began to curse loudly, as I walked over to peer out into the still dark morning. Off in the distance, at the end of my cul-de-sac, I could see the figure of a woman, presumably the one from before. She was staring at me, her mouth still fixed in that scream. Then I heard it.

Low at first, then rising second by second, it was a song. A song so piercing and mournful it filled my heart with terror and despair. Then, without warning, the glass in front of me shattered, and I could see the figure approaching at a slow walk. I screamed, and turned to run back to the safety of my bedroom. That's when my bare feet slipped in the still warm coffee on the ground, and I had barely enough time to see the sharp, splintered handle of the mug as my falling weight rapidly drove it through my left eye.",2,1728724132.0,shortscarystories,0,0.75,False

# 

In the terrian of artificial intelligence, a new star has risen - Claude AI. This powerful language model, developed by Anthropic, is making waves in the AI community with its unique approach to safety, accuracy, and user experience. Let's dive deep into what makes Claude special and how it's changing the game for businesses and individuals alike.

# The Birth of Claude: A New Era in AI Assistants

Remember when AI assistants were just glorified search engines? Those days are long gone. Claude represents a quantum leap forward in what AI can do. Born from Anthropic's commitment to developing safe and ethical AI, Claude isn't just another chatbot - it's a sophisticated reasoning engine designed to tackle complex problems across various domains.

Anthropic, a relatively young player in the AI field, has quickly made a name for itself with its focus on developing AI systems that are not only powerful but also aligned with human values. This commitment to ethical AI is baked into Claude's DNA, setting it apart from many of its competitors.

The journey from Claude's initial conception to its current incarnation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, has been marked by continuous refinement and improvement. Each iteration has brought new capabilities, enhanced safety features, and improved user experience. It's like watching a child grow up, except this child can analyze market trends and write code.

# Claude 3.5 Sonnet: The Goldilocks of AI Models

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the latest and greatest version of Claude, striking a perfect balance between efficiency and power. Think of it as the middle child in the Claude family - not as lightweight as its sibling Haiku, but not as resource-intensive as the powerhouse Opus. It's just right for most users and use cases.

What sets Sonnet apart is its versatility. Whether you're using the free tier or splurging for the paid version, you're getting access to a tool that can handle everything from creative writing to complex data analysis.

# The Claude Difference: Features That Set It Apart

# Visual Reasoning: More Than Meets the Eye

One of Claude's standout features is its advanced visual reasoning capabilities. This isn't just about identifying objects in images - Claude can analyze charts, interpret graphs, and draw insights from complex diagrams. It's like having a data analyst and a design critic rolled into one.

Imagine you're preparing for a big presentation and you've got a bunch of charts and graphs that make your eyes glaze over. Claude can help you make sense of it all, pointing out trends and patterns you might have missed. It's like having a really smart friend who's always ready to help you prep for that big meeting.

# Safety First: The Ethical AI Assistant

In a world where AI ethics is increasingly under scrutiny, Claude stands out with its strong focus on safety and responsible use. It's designed to protect user privacy, encourage fact-checking, and maintain a balanced perspective on complex or controversial topics.

This commitment to ethics isn't just a marketing gimmick - it's fundamental to how Claude operates. It won't help you spread misinformation or engage in harmful activities. Instead, it gently nudges you towards more responsible and accurate use of information. It's like having a wise mentor who keeps you on the straight and narrow.

# Claude Artifacts: The Secret Sauce

Now, let's talk about one of Claude's most exciting features - artifacts. These aren't ancient relics or mystical objects. In the world of Claude, artifacts are self-contained pieces of content generated during your conversations with the AI.

Think of artifacts as the greatest hits of your Claude sessions. When you ask Claude to create something substantial - like a code snippet, a full document, or even visual content - it doesn't just spit it out in the chat. Instead, it creates a separate, reusable artifact that you can easily access, edit, or repurpose later.

This feature is a game-changer for productivity. No more scrolling through endless chat logs to find that brilliant piece of code Claude wrote for you last week. With artifacts, it's all neatly organized and ready for use.

But artifacts aren't just about personal productivity. They're designed with collaboration in mind. Anthropic envisions a future where teams can work together around a shared space of Claude-generated artifacts. It's like a shared brain trust, powered by AI.

# Artifacts in Action: A Real-World Example

Let's say you're working on a new brand identity for your startup. You ask Claude to design a logo based on your brand values and target audience. Not only does Claude generate a sleek SVG logo, but it also creates an artifact with the logo design and its associated code.

Now, you can easily share this artifact with your team, make tweaks to the design, or use the code to implement the logo across your digital platforms. And if you decide you want to refine the logo further? Just ask Claude, and it'll create a new artifact with the updated design.

This iterative process, facilitated by artifacts, makes Claude feel less like a one-off tool and more like a collaborative partner in your creative process.

# Claude in the Wild: Real-World Applications

# Financial Wizardry

In the high-stakes world of finance, Claude is proving to be a valuable ally. Financial analysts are using Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities to crunch numbers, analyze market trends, and generate insightful investment strategies.

Imagine you're trying to predict how a new government policy might affect the stock market. Claude can help you sift through mountains of economic data, historical trends, and expert opinions to generate a nuanced analysis. It's like having a team of expert analysts at your fingertips, ready to work 24/7.

# Retail Revolution

Retail businesses are leveraging Claude's visual analysis capabilities to optimize store layouts and improve customer experiences. By analyzing images of store layouts and customer behavior patterns, Claude can suggest tweaks that could boost sales and customer satisfaction.

It's like having a retail guru who can look at a snapshot of your store and immediately spot opportunities for improvement. ""Move that display to the right, and you'll see a 10% increase in sales,"" Claude might suggest. It's data-driven decision making at its finest.

# Code Creation Made Easy

For businesses looking to streamline their processes, Claude's code generation capabilities are a godsend. Need a dashboard to monitor your KPIs? Claude can whip up the React code for you in no time.

But it's not just about generating code. Claude can explain the code it writes, suggest improvements, and even help debug issues. It's like pair programming with an AI that never gets tired or needs coffee breaks.

# Breaking Language Barriers in E-Commerce

Global e-commerce companies are using Claude's multilingual processing capabilities to reach customers around the world. From translating product descriptions to localizing customer reviews, Claude helps businesses communicate effectively across language barriers.

It's not just about word-for-word translation. Claude understands context and nuance, ensuring that your brand's voice remains consistent no matter what language you're speaking.

# The Road Ahead: Claude's Potential and Limitations

As impressive as Claude is, it's important to remember that it's not a magic wand. Like any tool, it has its limitations. For example, while it can generate simple visual designs, it might struggle with more complex visual requests. Ask it to create a logo with a ""wooden texture,"" and you might be disappointed with the results.

But these limitations aren't setbacks - they're opportunities for growth. As Claude continues to evolve, we can expect to see improvements in areas like complex visual generation, real-time data processing, and even more advanced reasoning capabilities.

The key is to understand what Claude excels at and where more specialized tools might be needed. It's a powerful, versatile assistant, but it's not a replacement for human creativity and expertise. Instead, it's a tool that can amplify human capabilities, allowing us to work smarter and more efficiently.

# Why Claude Deserves Your Attention

In a world awash with AI tools, Claude stands out for its combination of power, versatility, and ethical design. Whether you're a business leader looking to optimize your operations, a creative professional seeking inspiration, or just someone curious about the frontiers of AI, Claude has something to offer.

Its unique features like artifacts and advanced visual reasoning, combined with its strong focus on safety and ethics, make it a tool that's not just powerful, but responsible. In an era where the impact of AI on society is under intense scrutiny, Claude represents a step towards AI that augments human capabilities while respecting human values.

So, whether you're looking to streamline your workflow, tackle complex analytical tasks, or just explore the possibilities of AI, give Claude a try. You might be surprised at what you can achieve with this AI assistant by your side.

1g1w38g,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1g1w38g/work_keeps_cutting_my_hours_what_is_the_best/,Work keeps cutting my hours what is the best course of action?,"Im 16 and first got the job as a waitress in late June this year. What I negotiated for was as many hours as possible in the summer then 6-12 hours over weekends once school resumes. In my round of new hires, I was the only one with past experience in ANY sort of work environment (as i have been working since i was 13), let alone in a restaurant setting. I was already familiar with all the ins and outs of how a restaurant runs, how to operate the bar and how to speak to customers. At training, my managers made it very clear that since I knew a lot already, that i could get straight into working my summer hours.
All I say now is that over the course of july and august i had only about 11 shifts (that were between 3-5 hours) that most times were cut to even fewer. 30 minutes before my shift i‚Äôd receive a message to start 2 hours later or just not come at all. This isn‚Äôt inherently bad but just a bit irritating considering i‚Äôm only being paid 6.40/hr so my pay works up to literally nothing. 
When september started i was consistently getting 6-8hour shifts every weekend and sometimes being asked to stay til close for more hours. I was no longer bothered about what happened in the summer as a lot of people had quit and there were more hours available on weekends. However recently an issue has arisen of my name being put down for multiple 6-8hr+ shifts in the weekend but they‚Äôre now being cancelled last minute or significantly cut down and i just get sent home on the next available bus. 
Most recently, I was put down for a 9-7. 9 is just before they open so i get all the tedious menial tasks shoved on me like wiping windows and sweeping leaves outside and re-sweeping the inside of the restaurant (something i KNOW is supposed to be the responsibility of closing staff and no one ever does it in the morning). A few minutes after im done with those my shift becomes a 9-5, then 45 minutes later it becomes a 9-whenever-its-not-busy. I wasnt too bothered because it was a sunny saturday afternoon and i was expecting lots of customers. I was midway through making 3 different orders of coffees when the manager on the clock tells me essentially ‚Äúthe next bus to where you live comes in 4 minutes. get your shit and leave‚Äù. My surprise to look at the clock in counter and ive only worked for 2 hours 30 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous.

Now the incident that triggered this post, I was scheduled for an 11-4 this morning and ive just received 2 messages from my manager saying
‚ÄúHey please can you start at 12 today‚Äù then
‚ÄúActually have today off please‚Äù 
My parents have told me multiple times to quit but i always disagreed because finding a job in my area right now is very difficult, but now its seriously something i‚Äôm considering and i dont know what to do moving forward.",1,1728723711.0,work,2,1.0,False

I recently became part of this friend group. There‚Äôs a guy I really like, he‚Äôs really cute. Given his history he clearly has a type that‚Äôs very much not me. I noticed that when we‚Äôre out he‚Äôs very friendly and chatty with everyone but I don‚Äôt get the same vibe. He always keeps a little distance between us physically, doesn‚Äôt take pictures with me. We do text but he‚Äôll take days to reply, and even then I‚Äôm the one that starts the conversation and asks questions. He is friendly when we talk but it feels like he‚Äôs just being polite, like you would a neighbour, not like a friend that wants to get to know you. The other girls in the group said that‚Äôs just his personality and that he‚Äôs just always really busy and that if he didn‚Äôt like me he wouldn‚Äôt even bother messaging me. But I‚Äôve picked up on things like little cute jokes he won‚Äôt make with me but will with others. Never likes any of my photos but likes everyone else‚Äôs. I have suggested in the past we grab a coffee or something just us two and he says he‚Äôs either really busy or that he‚Äôll look into some dates later on and get back to me.

I can‚Äôt even bring it up cause I don‚Äôt want to sound crazy but I‚Äôm definitely picking up vibes he‚Äôs not interested in me, much less wants to be friends with me. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some words of encouragement. I‚Äôm a nice girl and I get on with everyone else the group so well we all instantly clicked but with him it just feels forced.

During those weeks I have been so tired. Almost only sleeping or watching serie.. like i am exhausted. He have been taking care of kids and household, well kind of. But. He constantly beeing rude to kids. Slapping their bums, neglecting them and so on. So I feel I haven't been so relaxed. Just exhausted tryint to rest. Today, this morning, he slapped my 1,5 y on bum and I said right away what the fuck are you doing don't fucking touch him. He said ""i didn't touch him"". I said ""I SAW YOU!"". He got quiet the first seconds and this escalated into a fight. Let me add that this started cuz my son wanted to take a bite from my sandwich and i gave him the whole, because I had 2.
He then said when I said ""its against the fucking law to beat children so STOP doing it!"". And he said ""I only friendly tapped"". I said stop beeing so manioulating and changing and twisting reality all the fucking time because why is he crying then???? He then said ""no, you know what, better he shits on the carpet"". (He is referating to yesterday when he took his nappy off and pooped on the floor, but I mean, so what? I cleaned it and he just does what kids does cuz im trying to potty train him so, again, so what???) BUT this made me so fucking pissed off i threw my tea on him, threw the sandwiches away and said ""eat them fucking yourself now you fucking evil idiot"".

Now im sitting here wonder if i am the narcissist and why I can never be calm when he pisses me off like this. 

Even in front of the kids. 

My blood boils.

I wish I was stronger and a better mom, they don't deserve to see me ever like this but its something with him I just can't shut the fuck up when he starts with his lies. 

Like, why is he hitting his bum for fucking tasting my sandwich? Isn't up to me if I want to give? I mean I hardly believe my son will turn out to be 35 y old and stealing sandwiches from peoples hands in future. 

Why can't I just be calm??? 

BUT HE PISSES ME OFF. STOP FUCKING TOUCH MY KIDS AND STOP BEEING MEAN TO THEM, STOP TALKING NASTY TO THEM, SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT THE FUCKING UP.

I have to confess I even went to kitchen where he left to ignore me when I got pissed off and poured his fucking coffee out in the sink. He said ""why the fuck would you do that?"" I said ""why the fuck did you slap my son, shut the fuck up?!"".

Like he can't just keep the house calm. I WANT CALMNESS. And he is the one adding shit, stress and god knows what.

Fucking hell.

1g1vokb,https://i.redd.it/ucwn6nmcdaud1.jpeg,First Ride Thoughts 24 Defy ,"Greetings Riders,

I took my newly purchased Defy 1 advanced out this morning . For context I didn‚Äôt test ride it before purchase . The dealer (Korea) would not allow it. I had to go off of reviews. I did test the it‚Äôs competition (most of the options) non compelled me to buy. Though the Domane sl6 was close.

I did get a full fitting. The dealer raised the handbags 5mm and rotated them up a little, he push the seat a little closer to the bars (we are taking millimeters) these little changes and getting my seat post and clips and shoes all synced was key. I would say a good 30-45 min to this right. 

Anyways by the time I got home, it was dark so I watched some bike reviews on YouTube and crashed.

The alarm was set for 6am today.  I woke up , did my stretches, coffee, watched some more bike reviews , some
Mobility movements and I was out the house with a huge smile on my face at 7:45ish.

My initial was impressions first 5min were wow. Smooth, perfect fit, and more smooth. In terms of responsive and acceleration, I would say it didn‚Äôt feel much faster than the Domane. But once I was getting up to my normal cruising speed (right between zone 1 and 2 on my Garmin) I was at easy 18mph.  Previously on my 2018 rim brake Canondale synapse I would be around 16.5 MPH in the same effort range. That‚Äôs a great improvement. On the Domane I was also at 18MPH. However when I started pushing it, getting to zone 3 near zone 4, that‚Äôs where Defy shined, I clocked 26mph for a good few minutes. I tied the Domane at 25MPH. But at my upper limit, the Defy felt more planted and also more manageable and maneuverable.

I hit my midway point a good 5 ish min faster than my normal times.

After some more coffee , some water and  bike photos, I returned back, on the return, I did notice the seat was not as good the Doman, in fact it started to irritate me. I think I just need to break it in and adjust my body to it.

So first ride ‚Äî10 miles for coffee, 10miles back and I am very pleased. I‚Äôm not blown away, but I am pleased . 

I did end up raising the seat about 1 inch after the ride and that was the final touch to make the fit exactly what I wanted . 

Rider:

Size 54  ‚Äîperfect fit. 



Now do I wonder what the BMC Roadmachine and Lauf Uthald would be like . Yes I do. But you can‚Äôt have them all. 


Tomorrow‚Äôs ride will be some hills and beautiful switchbacks and the distance will be around 40miles. I‚Äôll report back. ",9,1728721764.0,Giantbikes,2,0.92,False

1g1vfv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1g1vfv9/he_lives_amongst_you/,He lives amongst you,"A shadow was cast over us. A silent shriek that haunted history since we first took breath. While our ancestors feared the predators luring in the dark, they missed the monster hiding amongst them. He has no origin. He has no soul to call his own. His only reason to persevere is to feast on our suffering. Or so I was told.

Throughout the recorded history only a few noticed his presence. I would have never learned of this foul beast if it hadn‚Äôt been for my father, who taught me once I was old enough. A family secret passed down the generations, bound to an oath to avenge the fallen. I wish my father would have taken the truth to the grave.

At first, I believed him to be mad; the beast was nothing but a ghost of his tormented mind. But the evidence he showed me convinced me of the opposite. In many human catastrophes, countless blood baths, or killings of innocence, he had his hands in. From the dawn of our species to now.

The writings my father revealed to me seemed a crude joke at first. But the more he amassed on me, the more my mind struggled to deny the truth. Once I saw the pictures, my skepticism died. A shade striving through human filth. Every step he took sent waves throughout the place he had infiltrated.

Sometimes he orchestrated entire uprisings that could only end in blood with only crows reigning supreme over the graveyard he had filled. Though more often than I would like to believe, all he needed to do was a minute action. Nothing but a little push to cause a ripple that would summon a tsunami.¬†

An unfortunate accident of someone important or the right words whispered into the ears of a future terrorist. Despite my extensive studies of the beast, I can‚Äôt tell how he knows who or what to influence to bring his wanted outcome. Perhaps he can see the future or all the different potential futures. Perhaps he is just guessing, and only his successful attempts have been documented. His failures would remain unknown to us. If there are any.

As to what I believe, I think the beast can glimpse into the human heart. It can decipher what we carry in our chest, hidden even from ourselves. With this information, the beast can play every human to a degree where it appears to be mind control. His capabilities are more akin to rewriting fate; as if he put us all on a determined path that would bring nothing but destruction.

This, at least, is what my father, my family, and every other doomed soul believed about him. To explain further, dear reader, you have to indulge me. Before unmasking the beast, I have to describe what brought me to the point of writing it all down so other people could learn of this thing. Then you will understand.

As I said, my father opened my eyes to the harsh truth when I was an adult. But even before that, I could tell something was wrong with my father. He always appeared to be preoccupied. As if something was haunting his mind. Father never cared for any of my interests or me in particular. Me and mother were nothing but noise irritating his important work. I asked Mother a few times why Father behaved in such a way. She knew about the beast, but I can‚Äôt tell when Father explained it to her.

‚ÄúYou will see, Jonathan,‚Äù she used to say. ‚ÄúSoon you will see.‚Äù

The only time Father invested his precious time into me was due to my education. Anything besides the best wasn‚Äôt good enough. Father never raised his voice against me or hit me, but he punished me with silence. His eyes were always cold, but when I couldn‚Äôt meet his high expectations, they gained a certain loathing for me. Before his disinterest would originate from a genuine lack of care, now it would arise from disdain. Only when I redeemed myself did he cease.

Praise was a rare occurrence but when it came, I held on to it like a thirsting man to water, using up every bit of it in my fruitless attempt to satiate myself. Mother was much the same. It might sound cruel, but I don‚Äôt think of her as a person. She served more as an extension to my father. She never spoke about the time before she met him. The way she acted you would think there was no such time. I don‚Äôt know what she saw in him to cast aside her identity and any hope for a loving husband in favor of my father who appeared to have lost all interest in her once I was born.

The only reason to be intimate with her was to create me. Nothing had any sentimental value in the eyes of my father. It was nothing but a means to an end. My mother to birth an heir, and me to carry on the family oath. An oath inherited from father to son for lord knows how long. My family history is not something I enjoyed to study. It is filled with tragedy and agony; much brought on by my ancestors themselves in their obsessed drive to hunt the beast.

I can only speculate how my grandfather treated my father, but by his hostile demeanor, it couldn‚Äôt have been better than my upbringing. Worse by the way he screamed in his sleep. Whatever it was, Father never dared to speak it out loud, but it influenced his every action and instilled him with the drive to end this generational-spanning pursuit. I shared this desire to end it all, as the thought of putting a child of mine through the same training I went through filled me with dread.

Every waking hour was focused on strengthening my body and honing my mind. I had to endure several harsh years of combat training and study concerning the beast. All for increasing my chance to not just survive an encounter with him but to also defeat him. Despite my father‚Äôs many shortcomings, he knew his craft and how to pass on his knowledge and skill to the next generation.

In these years I learned to hate my father in earnest. Before that, I was afraid of his judgment and yearned for his approval. But after receiving his complete attention, I came to understand that my father‚Äôs opinion shouldn‚Äôt be something to be taken into consideration. But I stayed. I stayed by my father‚Äôs side and did everything he told me to do.

After just a year, I had all the expertise to flee his grasp and survive on my own. Then why didn‚Äôt I? Easy, he had a point. The beast had to die. The fallen deserved to be avenged. And while my father was someone that I didn‚Äôt owe anything to, he was my best chance in eliminating the beast.

I think it was during the fourth year of my training that my father either thought I was prepared enough, or he couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. He was possessed by the wish to be the one who defeats the beast and puts an end to his secret reign. Gathering all the intel we had on the beasts, collected over countless decades by my family, we crafted our plan.

Based on all we had on the beast, we could narrow down his current location and identity. The beast wasn‚Äôt just a master manipulator but also a genius actor. How many different characters he made up over his long existence to blend into human society is impossible to tell. Tricking such a being should appear to be impossible, but my father and I noticed something.

Hidden underneath all the evidence of the beast‚Äôs existence and his deeds, there was a pattern. He was unstable. Despite all the knowledge and cunning he had, he often committed grievous mistakes, which seemed to pile up over the years. Did he lose his caution, as no one had been able to stop him yet? Or was something else occurring?

At this point in time, we couldn‚Äôt say, but we knew for certain that the beast wasn‚Äôt perfect. Take my family for example. As I have already mentioned, many of my ancestors didn‚Äôt enjoy a long life. Dedicating yourself to a war against the devil himself didn‚Äôt just promise a constant threat to your physical health but also to your psyche. While the beast laid waste to several members of my bloodline, many more couldn‚Äôt handle the truth and looming shadow of the adversary, taking solace in drugs or alcohol. Or mere severe measurements.

Why then didn‚Äôt the beast end my family? Why take the risk of anyone coming for you; no matter how slight the chances of one‚Äôs own loss? The answer is the beast tried. He had tried to kill every single one of my ancestors but failed to do so. Multiple times he came close, but always one member of my family escaped. Why not turn the tables and hunt the hunter? Because for some reason, the beast couldn‚Äôt.

Furthermore, the beast showed periods of inactivity. While measuring his actions proved near impossible, as often his influence was too faint to notice, we were able to map his deeds. Similar to his incompetence, his level of downtime was increasing. Did he need to rest more the further he aged? Questions over questions and there was only one way to answer them all.

My father and I took a great risk by going after the beast with such lacking intel, but both of us were keen to end the hunt. It appeared we didn‚Äôt just inherit the responsibility to stop the beast but also the tiredness of an entire bloodline, fighting for far too long. So, after months of observation and stalking, we were able to find him.

With the difficult part done, we went for the near-impossible one. Catching him. You see, Father didn‚Äôt just want to assassinate the beast, he wanted to capture him. The family records show that the beast isn‚Äôt someone to be trifled with, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to be unkillable. Ageless yes, but not immortal. This being said this doesn‚Äôt mean he would die as easily as a human being would.

One of my ancestors for example shot the beast six times in the chest. The bullets drove him to death‚Äôs door, but he succeeded in escaping justice despite his injuries. This showed us that we couldn‚Äôt believe normal measures to be sufficient to accomplish the deed. But perhaps it would have been. We were certain the beast was weakened, so maybe a well-timed bullet to the head would have been all it needed.

But no, father wasn‚Äôt willing to take any more risks. So, we decided to capture him and to take our time ending him. To accomplish this, we started to poison him. Small doses at first, nothing that should alarm him. We wanted to test out whether it would numb him enough to seize him.

One of the training fields which I had to master was deception and disguise but fooling the fools‚Äô lord was impossible. Once alarmed, the beast would vanish, and it would take decades to find him again. So, we couldn‚Äôt come into direct contact with him, but with the people around him.

The coffee shops the beast loved to visit, his workplace, and his favorite restaurant. The beast is a creature of habit, and we had his schedule mapped out. We knew when he wasn‚Äôt nearby, so we could infiltrate his surroundings to place our drugs and poisons. And within days, our plan proved itself successful.

The beast appeared sick, barely able to keep his eyes open. His workplace ordered him to stay put at home and only return once cured. Dear reader, you might question our strategy. How could a being such as the beast ever fall sick? Wouldn‚Äôt such a creature be immune against all mortal illnesses?

The short answer is no. The beast‚Äôs body had been ravaged by the plague three different times. This allowed some of my ancestors and other hunters to find and fight him. But no matter the infliction, he persevered, but he suffered, nonetheless. And, more importantly, he was afraid for his life.

The beast did as he was told and remained at his home. On the third day, he went out to do some shopping. He had no one in his life to do this for him, fitting for a being of his nature. This was when we ambushed him. My father lured him next to our van by asking for directions. I told you, dear reader, I fear that the beast can look into the human heart and read it like a book. He should have noticed our intentions immediately right away. At that point in time, I thought the sickness was hindering his observation skills. Furthermore, I thought the beast believed himself safe, having forgotten all his caution.

Father distracted him for a few moments, so I could sneak out of the van. It happened within moments. The beast described which direction my father should take to reach his destination as I flung my arm around his neck and injected him with a mixture of drugs strong enough to knock out a horse. He was struggling underneath my hold, and I noticed his inhuman strength. If he hadn‚Äôt been weakened before, he could free himself with ease. As the mixture began to spread, I dragged him into the van. Once I closed the door, he had lost consciousness.

We brought him to our home and locked him up in our basement. Our house was reinforced and prepared for a direct assault of the beast. But also, to keep it there if the opportunity should open itself up to us. We bound him to a chair with locks of steel inside a cage. There were no windows, and the only door could take a rocket blast. Just for good measure.

I don‚Äôt know how long we watched his unconscious body. The arch enemy of not just our family but our very species trapped in front of us. Quite the sight to behold. Or so it should have been. I knew the beast looked like a common man, but you expect to see something in him. Some minute detail he got wrong. Something that would mark him as the devil. But no, he looked like someone ordinary. A bit disappointing.

He stirred after a few hours. He took in his surroundings, and the realization of his situation dawned on him. The lord of fools could act like no one. He begged. He sobbed. Screams for help. The beast fought against his restraints, roaring to be freed. My chest tightened at his performance. If I had been a lesser man, I would have believed him.

Father wasn‚Äôt moved either. He took his seat in front of the beast and began his questioning. He wanted to learn more about him before killing him.

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, man?!‚Äù the beast cried. ‚ÄúI have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù

Every time the beast failed to answer, Father hit him. Strong from the beginning, but his punches lacked the ferocity I knew my father to be capable of. That changed within an hour. Blood littered the floor accompanied by several teeth. It was a difficult thing to watch. The never-ending cries and my father‚Äôs wrath.

‚ÄúShow yourself, devil!‚Äù my father screamed. He seized the beast by his hair, wet with sweat and blood. ‚ÄúYour lies won‚Äôt convince anyone!‚Äù

The beast‚Äôs face was swollen. His eyes were shut, and his nose was broken several times; any resemblance of a human appearance was beaten out of his features. My father collapsed in his chair, panting. He had kept himself in peak condition. He could run any marathon with ease and his punches could crack a human skull with just one hit. That the beast had survived his barrage for hours by this point proved beyond a doubt that this wasn‚Äôt a man in front of me.

‚ÄúJonathan, do it,‚Äù Father said, wiping away the blood from his hands.

I took out the bag of tools we had prepared for this moment. I do not intend to describe what I did to the beast. My father took joy in his torment. That‚Äôs why I think we kept him for as long as possible. Not to learn anything, but to make him suffer. To force the devil to endure his own domain for once, share the fate of any poor sinner, doomed for eternity.

I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Often, I had dreams of grandeur. Of me being the savior that would free humankind of their worst adversary. That I would make the beast experience true regret once I was finished with him. Reality was less spectacular. I tortured him. Every pain you could imagine, I drowned him in. Agony you couldn‚Äôt even begin to grasp. Even if you torment the devil himself, your hands will be soiled by sin that can‚Äôt be washed away. It shouldn‚Äôt. It should stick to you to remind yourself what you are capable of and willing to commit.

Three days. Three days the beast endured‚Ä¶ no, three days I endured.

Up until this point, I had successfully disassociated myself from the situation and me. But as I was taking a break, cleaning myself, I started shaking. I couldn‚Äôt stand any more second in this.

‚ÄúJust say it,‚Äù I said, turning towards the beast. ‚ÄúJust tell him what he wants to learn.‚Äù

The beast was covered in blood and wounds. I hadn‚Äôt left a single spot untouched. His flesh was burned, cut, crushed, and worse. How many bones I broke or limbs I destroyed, I don‚Äôt dare to ponder. His body was more composed of freshly made scars than anything else, burrowing deep, speaking of pain reaching down towards hell. Yet he hadn‚Äôt died.

The beast‚Äôs head hung low, twitching. He was muttering something to himself. I grabbed a knife for the chance he would try something and approached him. I had to step next to him to hear his weak whispers.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wake. Let me sleep. I can‚Äôt endure it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThen confess!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBe truthful towards my father, and I promise your suffering will cease!‚Äù

The beast shook his head, tears falling. ‚ÄúIt hurts‚Ä¶ it hurts so much‚Ä¶‚Äù

Somehow, I knew he wasn‚Äôt speaking about the torture I put him through. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What is hurting you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy head‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs full. Please, I don‚Äôt want to wake‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, devil? Answer me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt hurts?!‚Äù the beast screamed. He jerked his head up, staring at me. I was startled, moving away from him. While his eyes had been shut swollen two days ago, his body had an unnatural capability to heal itself. Due to that, the swelling had receded, and I could see them. His right eye still had the light blue tone as when we captured him but not his left one. The iris was drenched in a dark that would devour you if you wouldn‚Äôt be careful with a hot crimson star in its midst. It burned. An inferno trapped inside his head, so intense it blinded me.

‚ÄúIt hurts! It hurts! It hurts!‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt stop screaming the same phrase again. He wanted to trash around, the bindings cutting into his flesh as they held him. He threw his head back, his chest rising and falling in violent interludes. Blood poured out of his left eye, red tears descending like a comet toward the ground. The look he gave me. No malice, no promise of revenge or carnage. Inside this trapped star of his, I saw no devil but a broken being, driven mad.

His wild stare pierced into me with the weight of too many lives. ‚ÄúWhy did you wake me?! Why?!‚Äù

Like a savage monster, the beast rampaged against his chains. A rage born from something I couldn‚Äôt understand took hold of him. But neither my father nor me were the target of his ire. I think the world itself or perhaps something grander laid at the core of his wrath. Too big to seize or to rip apart. Without a direct perpetrator to take revenge against, the beast seemed to want to tear apart anything too close to it, blinded by his inner turmoil. Something needed to die to clench this lust of his.

Dear reader, I can‚Äôt begin to describe the dread filling my lungs with every breath I took, pushing out the air I would have needed. Standing in close approximation to the beast and his anger crippled my mind and body, forgetting how to perform the simplest of tasks. How do I move my legs? How do I blink? How do I breathe?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all your fault!‚Äù the beast spat at me. ‚ÄúAll of you should go to hell! You should burn! All of you! Burn, you should! Burn!‚Äù

As his left eye turned towards me, I became the only thing it seemed to perceive in the whole world. Its inferno leaked out of it, and I swear, dear reader, I could feel the heat of it. It bit into me, threatening to burn away my flesh and soul alike. This little taste of it, of the agony that would await me, was all it took to make me run up the stairs and flee.

The next hours are nothing but a blur. I can recall taking my parents' car and driving until it had no fuel anymore. I left it abandoned on the street and made my way through a forest, dodging tree branches and other obstacles in my mad sprint. When I came to stop or why I don‚Äôt know.

All I remember was cowering against a massive rock, pushing my back into the moss growing on its surface. Like waking from a nightmare, I blinked at my surroundings, having to remind myself that whatever I thought to have gone through was over. That I was back in reality. Night was already on the rise, and I feared to have been lost in the forest. Thankfully, I hadn‚Äôt made it far into its green embrace and found my way out of it easily enough.

I walked all night, haunted by my own cowardice. Father would be infuriated. I would never hear the end of it. But this was nothing more than a passing thought. This cursed eye followed me like a wraith, digging its claws into my skull, refusing to let go. To find any refuge from its haunting presence, I replayed the strange rumblings of the beast. What had he meant?

I didn‚Äôt find an answer on my walk. My mind was in shambles. As the sun rose again, I had arrived at home, or what was left of it. At first glance, it didn‚Äôt seem of the ordinary. But once I noticed the bloody handprint on the open door, I knew what had happened. I stood there for a couple of minutes, licking over my dry lips.

Did I want to see my dead parents? Did I need to see their shredded corpses, their guts littered over the floor? I don‚Äôt know whether I ever truly loved my parents. Thinking of them in this regard appears alien to me. Why treat them in a way they never treated me? But as I stepped towards my old house, I could sense a tear making its way down my cheek. I felt relieved at its presence, living proof that I was still somewhat human.

It was the only one I shed for them.¬†

I won‚Äôt describe them to you. They deserve this much at least. Just let it be known, that they tried to fight.

The beast had broken free of his shackles probably shortly after I fled, ripped skin and flesh still sticking to the shattered steel. In a daze, I sat down in the very spot the beast had been trapped in. I didn‚Äôt care for the blood soiling my clothing. I had bigger things on my mind.

Did I feel hate for the beast? I can‚Äôt say for sure. The glimpse I received of him had disturbed my outlook on him. But, after pondering the last conversation I had with him, I came to understand who he really was. His fate.

And here we are, dear reader. We‚Äôve reached the end of my story, but this little tale is not over yet. You might remember that I promised to unmask the beast. That is only partially true. You would be forgiven for calling me a liar. I didn‚Äôt do so with ill intent. Everything I ever committed, I ever partook in, was only for the betterment of humanity.

I believed killing the beast a great service to my species, one that would remain unknown to them all, who yet couldn‚Äôt live without my deeds. I wasn‚Äôt wrong, but my goals have somewhat shifted. And the reason for that is you, dear reader.

One of you is not who they believe they are. You are not a bad person. You didn‚Äôt choose to be born like that. I thought you were a devil. Perhaps you were once. I can‚Äôt say. But what I can say is that I think I understand your turmoil. No, his turmoil.

No mind was made to endure eternity. The weight of his memories is crushing him, aren‚Äôt they? When I had woken him, I had woken him to them. Had he really fed on our suffering, or had he lashed out against anything that had taken him out of his slumber?

Is that why he had manipulated? Why he had pushed for destruction, as it was the only act of revenge he‚Äôd had for this cruel world that had birthed him? I won‚Äôt forgive him. I don‚Äôt think anyone can. My speculations shouldn‚Äôt be misunderstood as me trying to absolve him of his sins. They are his crimes, but not yours. You are a victim, unknowingly at that. But he is the same. A victim, too, but also a perpetrator. A broken child and a savage beast. ¬†

Dear reader, I know you are not aware of the true nature of your being. You are nothing more than a pleasant dream. A dream of normality. An ordinary life, free of the curse of eternity. But every dream will come to an end. The beast will lash out again, and I can‚Äôt let this happen. Too many people have died. This needs to end.

You might wonder, how I found you? How do I know you will be amongst the few to read these very lines? The answer is simple. I finally understand you. The reason my family and the others all had failed is because none had attempted to comprehend what they were hunting. The beast was never alone. You were always by his side, shielding him from his suffering. The beast had appeared unknowable. Something beyond human that we can‚Äôt ever truly predict. That only after decades of close reading we might hope to find his scent again.

But not me. Not anymore. Every step you take, every thought rushing through your mind, every tear you shed. Like an open book, you are to me now. You won‚Äôt see me coming. You won‚Äôt feel a thing. When you read this, you will think me either mad or this being nothing but a crude joke. And if you believe a single word I wrote, you won‚Äôt think yourself the beast. You will believe someone else to house the monster.

This is good. You will die convinced being human. This grace I will grant you. Why am I writing these words then? Why am I announcing my coming? It is not for my desire to tell my story or to warn you but for the beast inside. Despite being asleep, I believe him to be watching. To hear what you hear through a veil, a faint echo he can perceive.

I want him to know his suffering will end. And to you, dear reader, I am sorry. Sorry that it had to be you. May we all meet under a brighter sun. Somewhere free of curses.

And now, dear reader, it is time to say goodbye. For now.
