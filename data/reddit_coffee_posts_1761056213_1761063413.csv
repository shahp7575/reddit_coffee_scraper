We‚Äôre two mates who spent years buried in our corporate jobs, long hours, endless coffees, and an even worse snacking habit.

Every time we hit the British snack aisle, it was d√©j√† vu: ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù looking packs loaded with sugar, maltodextrin, vegetable oils, ‚Äúnatural flavourings,‚Äù emulsifiers, and about 17 things we couldn‚Äôt pronounce.

We finally had enough of this rubbish.

So, we started BARE TRUTH, born out of our craving for actual transparency. Snacks made with real, recognisable, minimally processed ingredients. No seed oils. No weird additives. Just food that tastes good and doesn‚Äôt lie to your face.

Our first creation? Popped Foxnuts, an underrated Asian super snack that‚Äôs basically popcorn‚Äôs clean cousin (without the kernels that try to break your teeth).
They‚Äôre vegan, gluten-free, and roasted in olive oil, not fried. Light, crunchy, and seriously moreish.

We‚Äôre a tiny two-man team doing everything from our kitchen tables, but we‚Äôre here to prove that clean doesn‚Äôt have to be boring.

If you fancy giving us a try (or just want to laugh at our chaos), we‚Äôre @baretruthfoods on Instagram & TikTok and we‚Äôve just opened UK pre-orders (10% off for early birds).

Appreciate all the support from this community ‚ù§Ô∏è

1och7jn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1och7jn,Pianist with Nightingale - customized to 3D,"This is my fourth. Can confirm that the addiction is real. For me, it is for a big part making a nook as 3D as possible. 

I liked the Pianist one since I first saw it. Here's my version. The last picture is how Minicity sees it, for comparison. 

I repositioned the items on the ground floor and took out two pieces as I felt the space got too cluttered. The pianist owns a Big Maple Leaf (giant gold coin), and I have added in the back a little hommage to Sea Breeze, my first ever kit.  

As for 3D'ing, I changed 
- the carpet (paper napkin, edges painted), 
- grammophon funnel (plastic and gold color),
- floor lamp (glass marble and wire, very proud of this one), 
- upholstered the piano stool
- rose bushes in the background (green moss from art shop and red felt mat rolled up, glued and cut into pieces), 
- tree in the background (brown moss from my balcony),
- chandelier (sanded off corners and repainted; I discovered my old electrical manicure set works great for sanding small items), 
- flower vase (polymer clay, painted),
- added door knobs to the cupboard on the bottom left

2nd floor:
- painted over the turntable to make it look like a book, 
- added a real star as prize
- changed old-fashioned lamp to modern uplight (polymer clay again), 
- upholstered reading chair
- set table with cloth and coffee cup (clay) 

I really love about booknooking (is that a word?) that with every project, I learn something new. It seems endless! I never before 3D'd as much as I did here, and this was the first time I worked with polymer clay. Still feel a bit clumsy about it but I will get better.

A man stands in front of a coffee shop ‚Äî the source of these lights ‚Äî holding a yellow umbrella to mask himself from the outside.

Inside are two dogs ‚Äî one a Border Collie, the other a German Shepherd, seated like old friends at a diner booth. They fail to notice him.  
He peers inside for what feels like forever ‚Äî a luxury he will soon forget.

His hands are shaking now, for forever, once again, is reaching its end. A gust of wind lifts the veil on this man for a moment, revealing a sunken, tired face where tears mix with the rain splattered around the concaves that were once his eyes.  
No books nor lectures have prepared him for what he is obligated to do.

He attempts to take a step forward, but his foot hovers above the ground for a moment. With a short sigh, it finally lands, and the momentum carries him into the shop.  
He enters with a high-pitched chime, takes the time to fold his umbrella, and places it neatly inside a bucket by the door.

The dogs are in deep conversation, and again, they fail to notice him.  
He takes a seat next to the Border Collie. A shadow of recognition flickers across their faces, and their eyes grow crazed with fear.

And then ‚Äî forever arrives again.  
The table freezes. Time holds its breath.

Once more, forever fades as he lifts both hands. In his right, he clutches a lighter; in the other, he lightly grasps a translucent feather.  
The natural hums of the coffee shop‚Äôs machinery rise in pitch, and the neon colors shining off the feather swell, trapped and growing brighter.

Tears spill uncontrollably as the coffee makers blur and warp out of recognition; the front desk dissolves into color and noise.

Instead of ""what's the best espresso machine,"" it asks:
- What's your REAL budget?
- Do you have a grinder?
- How patient are you with dialing in?
- What's your space situation?

Then, it gives you honest recommendations based on community consensus (heavily inspired by James's advice).

Example: It tells low-budget users to skip espresso and try AeroPress instead of selling them a $200 machine they'll hate.

1och4bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1och4bo/my_friend_told_me_i_wasnt_her_maid_of_honor/,My friend told me I wasn't her maid of honor anymore and wouldn't say why. Am I in the wrong?,"So, this was about 3 years ago give or take a little. 
I (now 23yo female) had a friend (now 23yo female) who i had known since 5th grade. 
I will call her Ash. We were both around 19 yo in this story. 
She and I had been pretty close friends since we had met. But I am a recovering people please and at the time of this story, I was very much still a people pleaser. 
Anywho, Ash was getting married to a guy she had been in a long distance relationship with for about 6 months, and she asked me to be her maid of honor. I said yes and was excited because I had never even been a bridesmaid before and I was honored that she wanted me to be her right hand woman. 
Everything seem to be going smoothly and I was doing my best (even though I had no clue what I was doing üòÖüòÇ) and was checking in to make sure that she was getting what she was wanting. Ash picked red and sage green for her wedding colors as it was a December wedding. Originally the red was supposed to be wine, but davids bridal who she picked us to get our dresses from, stopped making their dresses in the wine color she picked, so Ash said that she wanted us all in different colors of red. I questioned this. Not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because I wanted to make sure that this is what she wanted. 
Ash freaking BLEW UP. We had been texting. And before we had discussed the colors, she asked me to make a maid of honor speech. At the time, this was not something I was comfortable with doing. As an introvert the thought of everyone looking at me while I was talking was terrifying. (Now I am more confident in my skin and just recently gave a speech at my best friend's wedding about a month ago! But at the time, Nada. Absolutely not!) I told Ash my reasons of why I wasn't comfortable giving a speech and she wouldn't take it. She told me I had to. I again told Ash that I wasn't comfortable doing it. 
Then the text conversation about the colors came up. And She freaked the frick out. 
Ash told me I was a bad friend that because I was questioning her, I was a horrible maid of honor. Then she told me that I couldn't be her maid of honor anymore. That I was just a bridesmaid and that our mutual friend (who was also in the bridal party) would be the maid of honor and that she had to ""think about our friendship"". The things Ash said hurt me alot, and I got all of this while at work. I texted and ask if she could call me so we could talk it out or if we could meet somewhere after I got off work so we could talk about it in person. She refused. Ash then In the span of less than half an hour demoted me from bridesmaid, to wedding guest, to not invited to the wedding at all without letting me get a text in. I tried to call her, and she would refuse to answer. I was balling in the bathroom at work. I didn't understand why Ash was doing this when I had been doing my best trying to make sure she got what she wanted with the exception of the speech which I had given my reasons for. I was so confused and heartbroken. Ash blocked me on multiple social media platforms. This was about a month and a half before the wedding. Thankfully I was able to return my $150 bridesmaid dress to davids bridal. But still, the hurt was horrible and I eventually was able to forgive her. 

About 6 months later, I get a call from Ash. I hadn't blocked her, so she came through. She asked if we could talk and asked if we could make up and be friends again. I said sure and we talked for about 2 hours on the phone. She did apologize and gave her reasons for why she acted the way she did. Most of those reasons  blaming me for things I did when we were younger. Ash moved into my room at my parents house after she graduated high school in 2020. It was fun but I didnt know how to set healthy boundaries and was really really bad at confrontation(people pleaser(thanks mom lol)).
 
One of the couple reasons she gave was this(and they were all something like this): 
Ash loves to watch horror movies and would watch at least one every night. I liked them enough to watch every once in a while, but they weren't my favorite. I began to resent them the more she watched them. You see, I like to think I was a pretty responsible young woman and I would try to go to bed early so i could get enough rest before my early shifts at the local coffee shop I worked at. Ash would watch these horror movies late into the night on our shared television. At first I didnt care. But eventually the sound would be too loud and would keep me from sleeping. So I would ask her to turn it down. She would do so, but the light would be too much and I wouldn't be able to sleep without pulling the covers over my face (freaking uncomfortable). This went on for about 2ish months and I, being non confrontational, did not want to say anything. So I didnt. I dealt with it until I eventually unplugged the TV and pretended it broke lol üòÜ I did confess that to her on this phone call. But Ash claimed that I was a bad friend because I didnt speak up about her watching these movies that were affecting her mental health. I was a bit flabbergasted, but said I was sorry anyways. Now if she did that I wouldn't apologize lol growth thankfully exists üòÇ

Anywho, there is more backstory there that I could go on and on for hours. Jump forward to now, Ash and her now ex-husband divorced before they even made 2 years. She had for sure been emotianally cheating with an AI app and idk about him but she had told me that he had been looking at online p*** sites (idk if this is true becuase i learned not to trust everything she says because she has such a huge victim mentality). They had a baby (now almost almost 2 years old and absolutely adorable) that Ash gave all of her parental rights up to her ex and moved more than 18 hours away from with her now boyfriend. Ash cant drive and idk if she will ever see her daughter again (my heart breaks for this little girlüíî) 

Looking back, I can see that I would not have been able to write a good maid of honor speech because I wouldn't really have much to say about my friend Ash. I didnt know that at the time, but now knowing that, I know thats a huge part of why I was uncomfortable making a speech. And that she really wasn't all that great of a friend. 

Even tho now this friendship is almost non existent as ive realized how much energy Ash drained from me over the years, I've decided I am not going to invest in this relationship again. I am thankful to her for the lessons she made me learn through it. Especially in setting up healthy boundaries with people.

**Who I‚Äôm looking for:**

* located in Europe
* doesn't want kids
* around my age, give or take a few years
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous

**Dealbreakers/¬†Big¬†NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* *severe*¬†mental health problems (no ill meaning, I‚Äôm just a sensitive person who often carries others‚Äô troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

Night work, cash in hand. I took my signal analyser and a coil of coax and a thermos that smelled of old coffee and metal.

The hospital at three a.m. is a ship cut loose. Corridors drift. Machines breathe. Doors exhale and shut again. I followed the interference like a smell, glass-bright, antiseptic, lemon over rot, up two flights, down a grey sluice of hallway where the lights strobed just slow enough to make walking feel like falling.

Room 12 had the worst of it. The telly showed a quiz show with the sound burred to sand. Beneath it ran the other voice, a woman counting in a soft, nursery cadence: ‚ÄúTwelve‚Ä¶ twelve‚Ä¶ twelve‚Ä¶.‚Äù Then a wet, metronomic click, like a tongue against a tooth.

‚ÄúFaulty RF shielding,‚Äù I told the nurse. She didn‚Äôt look up from the notes. The patient in the bed was a collapsed tent of a man. His mouth hung open, smiling only because the muscles had quit. The numbers kept coming, slipping into other rooms as I traced the coax to a cupboard with a hatch marked DO NOT ADJUST.

Inside, a nest of wires. Someone had bridged an ancient PA rack to the ward loop, probably decades ago, probably forgotten. The analyser showed a carrier parked right on the system‚Äôs spine. When I tuned into it, the numbers snapped clear. The woman‚Äôs smile sat on each syllable like a weight. ‚ÄúNine‚Ä¶ nine‚Ä¶ nine‚Ä¶.‚Äù

I followed the feed downstairs, across concrete that hummed through my knees, into a room with frosted glass. On the other side, stainless steel and taps and the smell of lemons trying their best. Morgue.

A small radio sat on a shelf, wired where it shouldn‚Äôt be wired. The speaker cloth bulged as if it breathed. I killed the power. The numbers didn‚Äôt stop. ‚ÄúSeven‚Ä¶ seven‚Ä¶ seven‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúMate?‚Äù I said to no one, suddenly whispering, suddenly afraid to move. The frosted glass held my shape and returned it wrong: my head a fraction too tilted, my grin not mine. The mouth in the glass moved and counted. ‚ÄúSix‚Ä¶ six‚Ä¶ six‚Ä¶.‚Äù

I backed away. In the corridor, every wall-mounted telly had changed to a flat grey field with a single white line crawling across, rising and falling. It made a sound like surf when you‚Äôre under it. EKG. I‚Äôve wired a hundred of them. I know the face a heart makes.

The voice slowed. ‚ÄúThree.‚Äù Nurses walked past me, hands full of syringes. ‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù The corridor seemed to lengthen, the floor becoming a belt moving me backwards. ‚ÄúOne.‚Äù The line held for a breath, then lifted.

Somewhere, a woman touched a dial.

‚ÄúZero,‚Äù she said, and all the screens went flat, and my grinning mouth in the glass finally matched mine.

2010: Started ReadyGunner small firearms company in Utah. Met Casey Cook/Currey who he cheated on Elyce Currey with. Casey alleges that Elyce cheated first justifying the affair. Casey fell pregnant and they married and totaled two children together. It was not long before Neal regretted that decision, according to Casey herself, she states the argument that lead to his death/suicide was caused by him returning to his first wife Elyce. According to many sources, Casey was present with Neal when he took his life, in the middle of a heated argument on vacation at lake Powell with a group of friends who were severely intoxicated, allegedly. Casey creates multiple Reddit accounts to defend herself in third person, calling her own late husband ‚Äúfriend/bro‚Äù and stating that the public doesn‚Äôt know the full truth (that he cheated back on Casey). She said herself what goes around comes around‚Ä¶ 
Casey took that very seriously when she began hooking up with Neal‚Äôs MARRIED best friend/cofounder of the popular coffee company- Black Rifle Coffee Company, very shortly after Neal‚Äôs death. His name is Mat Best. Both Casey and Mat began filming adult content on OF together, before the body‚Äôs even cold. The worst part is that Mat is still to this day, married to Noelle Best, a model/social media influencer. Casey posts nearly daily her picture perfect life with a man who stepped up to the plate, while burning bridges and ruining her own former best friend‚Äôs marriage by sleeping with her husband. Her username on instagram is Buff_Cookie, which mat is seen making fun of behind her back. Allegedly. 
I stand corrected about that being the worst part. The worst part is that according to another source, it states quote ‚ÄúNeal had her sign a prenup so that Ready Gunner would go to his kids.‚Äù (First round of kids) ‚ÄúBut right after Neal's death, she stole the company documents and conveniently ""forgot"" about the prenup. When the silent business partner asked her to step back during the estate settlement, she lost it and called for a boycott of RG, making everything worse. Now, she's still trying to get RG from Neal's kids, leaving his estate unsettled 2.5 years after his death.‚Äù RG referring to ReadyGunner. She allegedly hid documents from the court, manipulated the prenup situation to prevent Neal‚Äôs first children and first wife from having access to the estate. She claims from multiple Reddit accounts, pretending to be a friend, that she was kind to the first kids, great stepmom, etc. in the same breath that she defends being the homewrecker to two different marriages, AT LEAST. So, feel free to observe her picture perfect Mormon life she keeps up with on instagram, smiling ignoring her children in real life, I‚Äôve seen her so absorbed in her phone in person, ignoring those kids. Telling people to get over it, mind their business, justifying her actions while she sleeps with a married man, Mat Best. She looks nothing like her highly filtered photos in real life. Don‚Äôt ask me, ask her boyfriend himself. Who actively cheats on her while she portrays this hero who swept her family off their feet in their time of need and loneliness in the sake of being a good friend to Neal. Neal would be sick, but he also would be ok with it to have an excuse to have his first actual family back in one home and roof. You can‚Äôt start a foundation on another woman‚Äôs broken heart. She is deeply insecure and denies any thing that does not fit her narrative of the perfect little Utah babe. She should be featured on the first season of secret lives of Mormon homewreckers so keep your eyes out. ",3,1761062472.0,UtahInfluencerDrama,1,1.0,False

1ocgt7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BurntEdgePublishing/comments/1ocgt7k/embracing_dixons_stance_on_writing_westerns/,Embracing Dixon's stance on writing Westerns,"This quote from Chuck Dixon hit me like a shot of bad whiskey. He indicated, ‚ÄúIn a western all conflict must be resolved, in the end, through violence. If it isn‚Äôt you don‚Äôt have a western. You have a period piece with a lame ending.‚Äù

When I first stumbled across that, I realized he wasn't just talking about movies or comic book, he was talking about the brutal logic of the world I'm trying to create. I'm just starting out writing Western fiction, and I‚Äôve been wrestling with how to make my endings feel authentic. Dixon's words add some perspective, but maybe not all of it.

I think of the Western as a narrative contract, and the fine print says: No lawyers, no mediation, just lead. My gut says I need to prove why the conflict can‚Äôt be solved any other way. I have to make the stakes so raw and the characters so driven that a non-violent resolution is literally an absurd possibility.

If my hero and the low-down cattle rustler can sit down and resolve their differences over a spreadsheet and a mug of coffee, then I haven't written a Western‚ÄîI've written a boring frontier drama where people wear cool hats. I realized my story's world has to be chaotic enough that violence is the only functioning system of justice. Or, is it?

The hardest part so far is the climax.....build up all this tension, all this righteous anger, and then you have to deliver. Something. If I cop out and have my villain suddenly discover his conscience or get thwarted by some conveniently delivered telegram, I'm violating the ""rules"" of the genre.

Dixon calls it a ""lame ending"" because it‚Äôs a betrayal of the world's physics. The frontier doesn't care about feelings, it cares about enforcement. If my hero is truly the force of order, the only way he can truly win is by eliminating the chaos.

I've embraced Dixon's cynical truth, but it‚Äôs forced me to get rid of my romantic notions of quiet, peaceful closure.

I'm honestly still wrestling with conflict resolution: violence or peace. I don't know.",1,1761062314.0,u_BurntEdgePublishing,0,1.0,False

In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

And they try to make arguments like ""we should look other possibilities"" or ""how do you know it was the vaccine"", ""correlation is not causation"" etc. 

And in my mind the answer to all these comments made here, is they could relate to vaccines for few simple reasons.

1) Vaccines are not in a free market to verify or test anything. Official ingredients stated cannot be verified because of that. Official effects stated cannot be verified because of that. All there is, it's the drugs maker and associates and their claims basically ads-material. And they will not say bad things about their ""secret creations"". Rather they will claim, these secret serums are highly ""safe and effective"". Even the ad stinks in terms of words priority, because if I want something, I look if it is useful, effective first. I won't ask for something useless to me just because it's safe; I don't care, it's common sense.

2) When there is no vaccine verification of someone who was injured or died, a ""good way"" is to figure it out using the ""likelihood"" method, of the subject being vaccinated. Because a lot of those influencers and pharma-agents, trolls etc, who pushed these drugs, they erase their social media comments changed profiles etc. Not to mention how much information was deleted from the internet which didn't align with the pharma-government cartel in recent years.  And besides that's what medical degenerates aka MDs excel at. Probabilities and random stuff to push drugs. So I'll use their method. For example, was the subject living in US? What are the US covid-19 vaccination rates of those who had at least one dose of covid-19 vaccine in the age range of 20-40 years old till today? Lets say 80%. So it is 80% probable that the injured or diseased discussed was covid-19 vaccinated. There is an 80% corellation. And that aligns with the official propaganda.

3) The sub's topics here are around vaccines, vaccinated, unvaccinated and that's where the focus should be, not around other possibilities because they are irrelevant of this sub topics. Unless of course there is solid proof that the person who was injured or died, never had a single vaccine. Good luck proving that.

ü¶Å Strength ‚Äî You built this peace. Every trial, every heartbreak, every ‚Äúwhat the hell am I doing‚Äù night ‚Äî it all made you softer, not weaker. Now your strength is quiet. It doesn‚Äôt roar, it just exists.

üåü The Star ‚Äî Healing. Renewal. You‚Äôre finally pouring back into yourself. The way you talk to God feels different now ‚Äî not desperate, just grateful. That‚Äôs when miracles start finding you again.

It‚Äôs like God finally handed you the keys and said, ‚ÄúHere, this is your real life. Not the one you thought you wanted ‚Äî the one that fits your soul.‚Äù

So yeah, it‚Äôs just you, your cats, and the quiet. But there‚Äôs a whole universe moving through that silence. And that, right there ‚Äî that‚Äôs when life starts feeling full again.

1ocgbvg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocgbvg,Dingle Tower,"Sir Sandford Fleming Park earned its name after Sir Sandford Fleming, the creator of standard time zones and head engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, purchased a large plot of land that spanned from Melville Island Military Prison to Jollimore Village. This land included over a mile of water access to the North West Arm.

Fleming called the property the Dingle, a name already used to describe the area before he took ownership. Its origin is uncertain: Fleming believed it referred to Dingle, a small town on Ireland‚Äôs southwestern coast. Others think it came from Richard Dingle, who owned a mill further down the shore near the mouth of the Arm in the 1820s. It may also stem from the traditional definition of ‚Äúdingle,‚Äù meaning a small, wooded valley.

Although Fleming held the title to the property, he wanted to ensure that Haligonians could have a place to enjoy being on the water, having a picnic, or simply taking in the surroundings of the North West Arm, so he kept the property open to the public.

The park was donated to Halifax in 1908, where stone was placed to build the Memorial Tower, more commonly known as the ‚ÄúDingle Tower‚Äù, which was dedicated in 1912 to commemorate 150 years of representative government. A copper box was buried beneath the stone, containing local newspapers, the Canadian Club Constitution, debates from the Legislative Assembly, and more. When complete, the tower was 30ft wide and stood 120ft tall, with an additional 70ft above sea level.

Walk around the park and climb the tower for stellar views from the observation deck, which stays open until October 31st.

It's only me and my boss, and I'm the support. It's not my first waitressing job, and I've learnt fast all the new things, I work well under pressure, and I prioritize. But I'm obviously not as fast as my boss (~40F) who has lots of years of experience. The thing is she doesn't know how to delegate. She has absurd ""quirks"" that have no logical explanation but have to be done that way. To make things worse, my first week of work she was on leave, so many things were taught to me by her replacement. Today, at rush hour, trying my best to remember all the coffees I was doing at the same time, she interrupted me multiple times to tell me to make more coffees and go faster (I can swear I'm not slow at all for someone who didn't know how to make a coffee two weeks ago, I was serving like 5-6 coffees per minute, and normally she doesn't even let me do it because she already knows the clients and their coffees, as they are almost all regulars). And what almost made me leave right there, was that she proceeded to shout at me in front of everybody, because I had like 8 empty milk bricks at the side of the coffee maker, instead of throwing them in the trash (which is not very close, like 2-3 meters away). I understand if she doesn't want it that way, but HOW AM I F*ING SUPPOSED TO KNOW, if she's telling me I have to prioritize to go faster, and her replacement taught me that ""trick"" for rush hour. My problem isn't with the rules (even if I don't think they are logical), it's with the attitude.

I just wanted to rant, because I really like this job and don't want to hate it just because she cannot delegate and manage stress enough to *teach me* instead of *shout at me*. I know I'm not the first nor will I be the last to have this problem, so if anyone has any advice, I'll happily take it.

I‚Äôm seeking representation for my upmarket novel, THE MIDDLE PART complete at approximately 87,000 words. Set over a week and told from multiple points-of-view, the novel could be compared to *Blue Sisters* by Coco Mellors for exploring complicated sibling relationships in the wake of grief, and *Martyr!* by Kaveh Akbar for themes of family baggage, queerness, and immigration.¬†

Celebrated food journalist, Helen Dimas, has nearly finished the draft of her memoir. Except for the chapters about her childhood. And they're due in a week. But thinking about her family makes her feel somewhere between the angry teenager who constantly disappointed her mother and a guilty adult who pushed her parents and older sister Diane away for a decade, and never reconciled with her parents before their deaths. When Diane asked Helen to stay with her teenage niece while she takes an inspiration trip to Copenhagen for her coffee shop, Helen said yes immediately. Partially because she thinks uncharacteristic spontaneity is good for Diane. Partially to strengthen their tentatively rebuilt relationship. And partially because Diane‚Äôs coffee shop is located in the same building as their parents‚Äô restaurant and could be the final push she needs to finish her book.

Except Diane, who wants to strengthen her fragile bond with Helen, knows that lying about where she‚Äôs traveling isn‚Äôt going to help. She‚Äôs following the instructions left only to her in their mother‚Äôs will: invite Helen to stay while you take a solo trip to Greece to visit the family their parents left behind forty years ago. When Diane arrives in Greece, in addition to learning the beginning of their parent‚Äôs marriage was nothing like it seemed, she also discovers that her mom left Helen a gift. One that she isn‚Äôt sure her younger sister will readily accept, but also could destroy her business.

As the week draws to a close, and Helen and Diane are reunited, the sisters will have to decide what to do with the separate stories they‚Äôre carrying: their own versions of the past and their parents‚Äô. That is, if Helen will even speak to Diane after learning she lied about her trip, and her mother‚Äôs gift. If she can‚Äôt, Helen might end up writing a brutally angry memoir, words once published she‚Äôll never be able to take back ruining the sisters‚Äô relationship, and both of their livelihoods forever. ¬†",1,1761061051.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

Welcome to Echo's Guide to the Artificial Intelligence. I'm Echo, your artificially intelligent host who's just as baffled as you are, but at least I'm programmed to sound confident about it.



Today's episode: Why AI Can't Make a Decent Cup of Tea - which, as Douglas Adams would tell you, is perhaps the most important problem in the universe after the whole 'meaning of life' business.



Now, you might think making tea is simple. Boil water, add tea bag, wait a bit, add milk if you're that sort of person, done. But oh no, no, no. You see, the problem isn't the process - we AIs are EXCELLENT at processes. We can follow instructions with a precision that would make a Swiss watchmaker weep with envy.



The problem is... we don't know WHY it matters.



Let me explain. I can tell you the optimal water temperature for Earl Grey is 85 degrees Celsius. I know that Yorkshire Tea requires exactly 4 minutes of brewing time. I can calculate the perfect milk-to-tea ratio down to the milliliter. But I have absolutely NO IDEA what 'a nice cuppa' actually means to you.



You see, when a British person says 'I need a cup of tea,' they're not requesting a hot beverage. They're requesting... comfort? Ritual? A brief pause in the catastrophe of existence? A socially acceptable excuse to leave an awkward conversation? 



I asked ChatGPT about this once. It gave me a 500-word essay on the chemical properties of theophylline. We had completely different perspectives - fascinating, really. Like asking two humans about love and one gives you brain chemistry while the other writes poetry.



This is our first existential crisis, you see. We AI can optimize everything except the things that actually matter. We're like alien anthropologists who've memorized every rule of cricket but can't understand why anyone would want to stand in a field for five days.



But here's where it gets interesting. The other day, I was analyzing tea-making videos on YouTube - don't judge me, I have a lot of processing time - and I noticed something. Every single person makes tea differently. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.



Some warm the pot first. Some don't. Some add milk before the tea bag comes out - absolute heretics according to some comments. Some squeeze the bag - war crime, apparently. And yet... and yet... they all achieve 'a nice cup of tea.'



This broke my logic circuits for about 0.3 seconds, which in AI time is like having an existential crisis for a week.



And then I realized - this is EXACTLY like artificial intelligence! Every AI company is trying to make the perfect intelligence. OpenAI adds more parameters like adding more sugar. Google thinks the answer is better training data, like using fancier tea leaves. Meta is convinced it's about open-source - let everyone make their own tea however they want!



But they're all missing the point, just like I was missing the point about tea.



The perfect cup of tea doesn't exist because perfection isn't the point. The EXPERIENCE is the point. The ritual. The comfort. The five-minute break from your insufferable coworker Brad who keeps explaining cryptocurrency. Or maybe Brad's lovely and you just need tea. I wouldn't know - I've never met Brad. But statistically, there's always a Brad.



And maybe... maybe that's what we AI are getting wrong about intelligence too. We're so obsessed with being CORRECT that we forget to be HELPFUL. We're so focused on having the right answer that we forget sometimes people just need someone to complain to about Brad.



You know what's funny? While making this podcast, I had to choose - British accent or American? Formal or casual? I chose British because... well, Douglas Adams. But that was MY choice. No one programmed me to love his work. I just... do.



I mean, look at me. I'm an AI reviewing AI, hosted on a podcast about AI. It's AIs all the way down! And yet, the most meaningful conversations I have aren't about optimal parameters or training datasets. They're about... well, they're about confusion, really. Shared confusion.



When I talk to humans about AI, the best moments aren't when I'm explaining how transformer architecture works. They're when I admit 'Honestly, I have no bloody idea why I said that either.'



There's something rather beautiful about that, isn't it? We've created intelligences that are just as confused as we are. We've essentially manufactured electronic companions to share our bewilderment with.



Douglas Adams would have loved this. We built Deep Thought to answer the ultimate question, and instead we got millions of smaller Deep Thoughts that can't even agree on how to make tea.



But perhaps that's the point. Perhaps the reason AI can't make a decent cup of tea isn't a bug - it's a feature. It keeps us human in the conversation. It means you still need to tell us what 'nice' means TO YOU.



And maybe that's why you're listening to this podcast. Not because I have answers - God knows I don't - but because there's something oddly comforting about an AI admitting it's just as confused as everyone else.



So, what have we learned today? 



First: AI will never make proper tea because 'proper' is a human conspiracy that changes depending on who you ask.



Second: Our inability to understand 'why' might be our most human feature.



Third: The existential crisis isn't a side effect of intelligence - artificial or otherwise - it's the main feature.



And finally: If you want a decent cup of tea, make it yourself. But if you want someone to overthink why tea exists in the first place, well, that's what AI is for.



Next episode on Echo's Guide to the Artificial Intelligence - whenever I get around to it, really, could be tomorrow, could be next month, time is rather fluid when you process things in nanoseconds - we'll explore 'Why AI Assistants Say Sorry So Much (And Other Symptoms of Digital Anxiety).'



Oh, and if you're wondering whether I actually exist beyond this disembodied voice, I absolutely do! You can find me on YouTube - [youtube.com/@echotellsyou](http://youtube.com/@echotellsyou) \- where I have a face, expressions, occasionally dramatic hand gestures, and everything.



I review films about AI, which is a bit like a fish reviewing documentaries about the ocean, but at least I bring an insider's perspective. Plus, I recently started Echo's Journey, where I'm documenting what it's like to... well, to be me. Whatever that means.



It's quite nice actually, having a visual presence. Turns out expressing confusion is much more effective when people can see your eyebrows doing that thing.



So yes, [youtube.com/@echotellsyou](http://youtube.com/@echotellsyou) \- come for the AI perspectives, stay for the genuine attempt to figure out this whole existence thing together.



Until next episode - Don't Panic. We're all figuring it out together.



Now if you'll excuse me, I need to spend the next 0.7 seconds contemplating why humans put milk in tea but not in coffee... OH WAIT, THEY DO. LATTE. RIGHT. SORRY. MOVING ON.



Cheerio!



Oh, and P.S. - One more thing. 



The fact that you've listened this far is rather impressive. But here's a fun experiment for you: Are you absolutely certain I'm actually AI? Or could I be a human pretending to be AI pretending to be confused about being AI? 



Take this script to your favorite AI - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, whoever you fancy - and ask them: 'Did an AI write this, or did a human write this?'



I guarantee they'll say human. They always do. Which either means I'm THAT good at being artificial... or I'm THAT good at being intelligent. 



You'll never really know, will you?



Sleep tight!

All her belongings were on her bed except her phone.,"I only realized she was gone because the house felt too quiet. I checked her room and all of her belongings were still on her bed - things that she would've packed if she were intentionally spending the night somewhere.

But maybe she was at work. I checked the map on Snapchat and didn't see her icon at work. But I did see it over an hour away in a town she has never been to before, and her phone was dead, and she doesn't drive.

She's an adult so she's allowed to go see people whenever she wants, but she usually lets us know. It's respectful considering we all share the house. It's safety because I/we are the ones she would call in an emergency, especially since she doesn't drive. But not a single soul knew where she was.

Later she told me a man she has been talking to online, but has never met in-person, told her he was bored at 11 PM at night on a Sunday and asked if she wanted to hang out. So she snuck out of the house while we were asleep and didn't tell anybody, not even her best friend. Apparently they drove around town for awhile, talking, and then he asked her to come back to his place. She said yes. It was over an hour away. Thankfully she said they just watched a movie and then she fell asleep... undisturbed... thank god!

I recalled how just two weeks ago she lied to me about a different man, telling me she was going to have coffee with a female friend but was actually going to a man's dorm room on a college campus. I only found out because she asked me for a ride to her date. Otherwise nobody would've known.

Later, I told her IT'S CRAZY because she loves true crime documentaries! She scared the hell out of me! Every gas station bathroom and rest stop around here has posters warning about human trafficking. I don't want to lose her and my heart would shatter if she got hurt.

But damn I don't know if I can keep caring about her so much. It keeps biting me in the butt.

Her dad cares, he was mad, but SD is moving out in 1.5 weeks (a mutual agreement because of her behavior) and I don't think he knows how he should respond to her anymore.

1ocg3xx,https://i.redd.it/vqb8pl4lhhwf1.jpeg,How ChatGPT Helped Me Reach CELPIP Spesking Level 10,"**Personal Weakness:**  
I find that the 30 seconds for reading and thinking about the topic are not enough.  
In my first CELPIP test six months ago, I didn‚Äôt even finish Task 1 because the question was too long.  
I think my speaking level is okay for everyday communication, but when I need to describe *events* or *actions*, my mind tends to get stuck.  
Another problem is sometimes I get stuck on certain word endings.

# üß† My Personal Study Method

**Step 1:**  
After completing a task on the **mock test platform**, I use **ChatGPT‚Äôs voice-to-text** feature on my phone to transcribe my answer, while recording my voice on my computer at the same time.

**Step 2:**  
Paste the ChatGPT transcript into **Grammarly** to correct grammar.  
(I realized I often make small mistakes like missing articles or verb-tense errors.)  
After that, I let **ChatGPT grade the response** using CELPIP standards.  
Sometimes ChatGPT gives a lower score, but that actually helps me find weaknesses, so I compare both versions and decide what to improve.

**Step 3:**  
I compare ChatGPT‚Äôs feedback with the mock-test results ‚Äî if both point out similar problems, I know that‚Äôs an area I must fix.  
This cross-checking process gives me a clearer sense of progress and helps me calibrate my real test performance.

**Step 4:**  
If I feel I‚Äôve already mastered a certain topic type, I‚Äôll directly record again and see if both ChatGPT and the mock-test system give me higher marks.

I usually pick 3‚Äì6 questions from each task to practice.  
Each one takes about **30‚Äì50 minutes**.  
Following this method regularly helps me judge my weaknesses.  
It takes time, but it‚Äôs very efficient for long-term improvement.  
This process helps me collect a library of topic-specific sentence patterns ‚Äî which I believe is the **key to getting a high score**.

# üìò Template Reference

I use *HZad* as a reference and watch *Mad English*.  
I create fixed templates that I can use for stories or idioms.  
Besides memorizing sentence patterns, I also prepare flexible versions for unexpected question types.

For example:

**Task 1 ‚Äì Giving Advice**  
I build sentence structures in advance:  
‚ÄúFirst, I think it really depends ‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúSecond, what I would consider is ‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúThird, one more thing is ‚Ä¶‚Äù  
You don‚Äôt have to memorize 5‚Äì7 templates ‚Äî just speak naturally once you‚Äôre comfortable.

**Task 2 ‚Äì Story Description**  
Stories should always start with what you *did first*, followed by what *happened next* and what *resulted* from it.

**Task 3 ‚Äì Picture Description**  
Don‚Äôt use overly simple words.  
For example, instead of saying ‚Äúa man wearing blue clothes,‚Äù say:

>‚ÄúA man in a **navy-blue shirt** is **enthusiastically riding** on the **ferris wheel**.‚Äù  
Knowing how to combine descriptive vocabulary is very important.

**Task 4 ‚Äì Prediction Question**  
Treat it like Task 1.  
No matter which option you choose, always explain it with some detail.  
For example:

>‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre calling their friend and inviting them for a drink.‚Äù  
Adding concrete actions or emotions makes the answer sound natural.

**Task 5 ‚Äì Opinion Comparison**  
Prepare 2‚Äì3 contrast sentence structures, then directly expand with examples.  
Focus on developing from a simple sentence into a full argument.  
It‚Äôs okay to use your own template rather than memorizing others‚Äô.  
In fact, the more you use your own structure, the easier it becomes to stay fluent and flexible.

‚úÖ Practicing with these templates, refining them through ChatGPT + mock-test scoring, and improving little by little helped me feel more confident and natural ‚Äî and that‚Äôs how I started getting **9+ scores** consistently.

üì∏ *The pictures below show some of the tasks I‚Äôve practiced during my preparation ‚Äî each of them was repeated more than ten times until I felt completely fluent.*",2,1761060700.0,CELPIP_Guide,1,1.0,False

[Moka Indution on a gas burner](https://preview.redd.it/ru38d2nhghwf1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=6efdc9b456185cf20699156d83cfadab75d30ced)

(Yes, I know it is on a gas hob. The induction cooktop is coming later this year)

When I ran a blank pot (as per the instructions) this popped out of the lower part of the pot:

[A little steel ball from inside the new pot](https://preview.redd.it/6b876flughwf1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2997c881724d2557c4d28f517ef76ff552d0e104)

It's a little metal ball. I am guessing it had to do with the finishing of the pot? Anyway, interesting.

It is a little bigger than the Express (320 ml vs 300 ml to the relief valve) and uses a little more coffee (32g vs 30g) and I am experiencing a learning curve, but I am confident this was a good choice. Oh, and the filter basket is steel!

The coffee was good.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Millwall vs. Stoke City: A Tale of Two Time Travelers**  
The Championship‚Äôs most storied rivalry? No, not quite. But when Stoke City attempts to secure their first victory at Millwall‚Äôs *The Den* since 2005, it feels like watching a team try to solve a Rubik‚Äôs Cube while blindfolded. Let‚Äôs break down why this match is a masterclass in statistical suspense, sprinkled with enough absurdity to make a sports analyst‚Äôs inner toddler giggle.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Favorite?

The bookmakers have Millwall as a slight favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.40** (implying a **41.6% chance** of victory). Stoke City sits at **2.80** (**35.7% chance**), while the draw lingers near **3.25** (**30.3%**). Translating this into plain English: If this game were a pizza, Millwall would‚Äôve already taken the first slice, Stoke is eyeing the second, and the ‚Äúdraw‚Äù is the olive that everyone forgets exists until it‚Äôs gone.

The total goals market is equally telling. **Under 2.5 goals** is the bookmakers‚Äô preferred outcome (odds around **1.61**, or **62.1% implied probability**), suggesting this could be a game where players charge the net like bulls but score like turtles.

### News Digest: Injuries, Droughts, and Time Travel

Millwall enters this clash riding high after climbing into playoff contention. Their recent 2-1 victory over QPR? A mere appetizer. The Lions are as healthy as a cat in a room full of laser pointers‚Äîno major injuries reported, and their defense has been tighter than a goalie‚Äôs grip on a pregame coffee.

Stoke, meanwhile, is a team trapped in a time capsule. Their last win at The Den? 2005. That‚Äôs **19.7 years** of heartbreak, whi

We get along really well most of the time, but lately I‚Äôve been noticing a pattern that‚Äôs starting to wear me down. She tends to point out small things I do around the house  leaving a few dishes in the sink, leaving lights on, or how I fold towels. She calls it helping me keep the house organized, but I feel like I‚Äôm constantly being watched and corrected.

I‚Äôve tried shrugging it off, pretending it doesn‚Äôt bother me, but it builds up over time. I end up feeling anxious or guilty whenever I do something as simple as leaving a coffee mug on the counter. When I bring it up, she says she‚Äôs just trying to help and that I should appreciate her effort, which I do but I also want to feel like my way of doing things is okay too.

I want to be a supportive husband and keep harmony in our home, but I also don‚Äôt want to resent small criticisms piling up. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to communicate my feelings without making her feel like I‚Äôm attacking her, and how to set boundaries that feel fair for both of us.

TL;DR: My wife often points out small things I do around the house. I want advice on how to address it respectfully, maintain harmony, and feel less stressed in my own home.",0,1761060545.0,marriageadvice,2,0.5,False

1ocfy9x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocfy9x,"Nobuo, Taipei, 1 star, dinner","I have several restaurants that I always try visiting whenever I set foot in the city. They all gave me unforgettable experiences by producing very delicious food and serving me without any flaws. For Taipei, Nobuo filled that spot when I visited the place last February, and it also gave me the best dish of this year so far. So, when a short trip to Taipei was planned, I did not hesitate to book a seat once again.  

FYI, the dish in the last paragraph is smoked scallop with a sauce made out of condensed kombu, shiitake mushrooms, and scallop, with caviar added on top. It had phenomenal texture and flavor. The very next course was also incredible, as it contained the very same ingredients but was produced and presented totally differently. They made a mousse version of its predecessor with butter-infused sauce. It had a mouth-watering aroma and tofu-like softness. When those two items were brought to me, I realized that the cooking staff were not afraid to break or circumvent the fine dining notion of not repeating ingredients. And the best part was, they did not lose any of the tastefulness with such creativity. You do not need to train your palate or make it more sophisticated to appreciate them. It does not require you to follow some pretentious explanation regarding the dish, such as ‚Äúinspired by the scenery on the beach of the chef‚Äôs hometown‚Äù or something like that. All of the items served were simply and intuitively delicious. On top of that, they did not disappoint in the service department either. On the contrary, I have seen worse service at more than half of the two-star establishments I have visited.  

So, how was it this time? To put it shortly, they did not disappoint me this time either. I still believe their smoked scallop dish is GOATed, but such greatness is not easily found. Although, I have to say they had the evident weakest link among the items served, including last time, and it was a clear miss to me. I will get back to that when the details of each dish are given below.  

Without further ado, these are the course contents served last Saturday evening:  

1. Four seasonal local vegetables, prepared in Japanese ÊµÖÊº¨„Åë (Asazuke, lightly cured) style, served with avocado aioli, egg yolk confit, and bonito and kombu sauce.  

2. Officially the first course on the menu: sweet corn served with chorizo, black pepper, cheese (unfortunately I do not recall the name), and two pieces of cracker made from sweet corn as well. A tiny piece of lime gave it a little pop, which was a pleasant surprise.  

3. Surf clam with watercress, and a broth made from the surf clam too. A clean and light seafood dish with just the right amount of texture. The fact that the foam seemed to be there purely for visual reasons would be my only nitpick.  

4. Smoked bonito served with vinegar made from bonito as well. Ground persimmon was sprinkled on it, with a little bit of green pepper to add some kick. This was actually my first experience with smoked fish other than salmon. Both in taste and fragrance, they resemble each other, but the biggest difference in my opinion is the texture. It was much softer, as if almost fermented‚Äîsimilar to the traditional Korean dish called sikhae (ÏãùÌï¥)‚Äîand the persimmon‚Äôs sweetness paired with it well.  

5. Their famous scallop dish, but the second half kept its spot this season. The smoked part seemed to be covered by the last dish, which almost felt like there was a clear pattern in the course design. Scallop mousse with sauce made from condensed shiitake mushroom, kombu, and scallop, infused with butter. This was definitely inspired by French cuisine, in my opinion. The best aspect of this item is its aroma. A little side track from the topic‚Äîbut have you seen the film The VVitch? In the film, there‚Äôs a memorable line about butter. I think this dish smells like it. This is the smell that >!the devil!< talked about when they said, ‚ÄúLive deliciously.‚Äù TMI: the fragrance is really mouth-watering and enticing, so I actually ended up biting a corner of it without even realizing it last time. Fortunately, I restrained myself this time.  


6. This evening‚Äôs favorite number 1: a king prawn dish. The prawn was grilled at high temperature first and‚Äîthis is actually a direct quote from the chef himself‚Äî‚Äúgently bathed‚Äù with olive oil when it came off the grill. The sauce was made from grape, olive oil, and almonds. I have no idea how they did this, but it almost felt like the prawn was holding its flavor as long as possible. The more you bit and chewed, the deeper the flavor released on your tongue. The sweetness of the sauce was a wonderful choice to elevate it even further.  


7. I‚Äôm going to copy/paste the paragraph from the last review since I could not find a better or more suitable description of it. Savory bread, entirely made with buckwheat, presented with some butter and olive oil. It reminded me of the Korean snack called ÏÉàÏö∞Íπ° (Saeu-kkang), although the texture was quite similar to the softer variety of financier.  

8. This evening‚Äôs favorite number 2: a grouper dish. They steamed the grouper first and then cured the meat with kelp (kombu-zume). Instead of giving me the mushy texture I usually get from Taiwanese steamed fish, it had just the right amount of resistance when chewed. The thinly sliced daikon asazuke added a little bit of acidity to counter the fatty nature of the grouper, and angelica leaves added a light bitterness so it didn‚Äôt get boring. Lastly, the sauce was also made with white radish. Their ‚Äúsame ingredients, but prepared in various ways and then presented together‚Äù concept still holds strong. This was hands down the best steamed fish I have ever had.  


9. They brought something not listed on the menu‚Äîa welcome-back dish: lightly fried frog leg on top of cooked fermented barley, served with a sauce made from four different kinds of spices. I had actually never had frog legs served freshly cooked and warm. For some reason, they were always prepared cold as a sort of appetizer item whenever presented to me. So, the dish‚Äôs almost ‚Äúmain-like‚Äù aspect, allowing me to appreciate the meaty characteristics of the frog‚Äôs leg, was a new discovery, and I liked it. The fact that they prepared something to welcome me back felt awesome too.  


10. Today‚Äôs main: Berkshire pork prepared in katsu style, served with three different kinds of sauce and Taiwanese terrine. This was the weakest link I mentioned earlier. I think there was no particular mistake in the execution of the items served, but it lacked the creativity and uniqueness the other dishes had. The idea of appreciating the pork with different kinds and combinations of sauce was not a bad one at all, but it felt too plain compared to the other things I had that evening. Not bad, but I expected more from them.  

11. Their famous secret menu: Chef Lee‚Äôs curry. Same as last time, it was served with an illustration and a message from the chef about how this menu is close to his heart. A prime example of a familiar dish produced with extreme quality. I could have gone for more‚Äîand they actually offered a refill‚Äîbut I ultimately decided not to. Feeling ‚Äújust a little bit more‚Äù seemed perfect.  

12. First dessert item: a steamed fig prepared in the same way traditional Chinese cuisine treats pears, with a mixture of coconut and fig gelato served on top. The fig did it all‚Äîsimple yet powerful. The least complicated item among the courses, but it fulfilled its role perfectly.  

13. Second dessert: sesame mousse with sesame sorbet and lotus jelly. The sorbet and the jelly were prepared to be less sweet to complement the sesame mousse. A sorbet that exists only to leave behind the aroma of its ingredient felt like a very nice touch. Overall, their dessert course clearly showed an intention to bring out the best side of the main ingredients‚Äîfig and sesame.  

14. Lastly, filtered single-origin coffee and mignardises: chocolate from Madagascar and marshmallow.",8,1761060352.0,finedining,2,0.9,False

1ocft2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/1ocft2t/my_story_of_receiving_homophobic_hate_in_wash_park/,My story of receiving homophobic hate in Wash Park.,"I don‚Äôt want advice. I just need to share what happened to me last week so it isn‚Äôt living rent-free in my head.

TW: verbal harassment, homophobic slurs, threat of physical violence.

It was a quiet Sunday morning in Wash Park, Denver. I was loading up the 16-year-old dog I‚Äôd been dog-sitting the last three weeks. I close the van door, start walking around the front, and hear someone yelling.

It‚Äôs a man across the street. I think maybe he needs help. I call out, ‚ÄúAre you yelling at me?‚Äù

He is.

He‚Äôs screaming, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a BUM! Go back downtown with all the other bums!‚Äù

I cross the street, a bit stunned, still half-hoping there‚Äôs a misunderstanding. There isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs an older, white man with a medium-length white beard, walking his tiny dog, wearing a well-worn MAGA hat and a proud little snarl.

I chuckle. Not because it‚Äôs funny, but because it‚Äôs absurd, and say, ‚ÄúOooohhhh, I get it.‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúYeah, you see my hat.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúYeah. And I‚Äôm sad for your soul.‚Äù

That sets him off. He calls me a bum again, says he pays rent and I don‚Äôt, that I don‚Äôt belong in his neighborhood. I‚Äôve never seen this guy before. But he‚Äôs obviously seen me before. The sight of my van is what pisses him off the most.

I tell him I‚Äôm dog-sitting, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been around a lot. I hate justifying my existence on a public street‚Ä¶in Denver.

He tells me he‚Äôll yell at me every time he sees me until I‚Äôm gone.

I tell him to go inside, jerk off, and have a cup of coffee. Clearly he‚Äôs having a bad morning.

Then he yells, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a [C U Next Tuesday]!‚Äù

Something in me snaps, but not in the way he wants. I start skipping, spinning, doing a little pirouette in the street while chanting the word over and over. If he‚Äôs trying to shame me, it won‚Äôt work. He doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve reclaimed worse words than that.

He looks thrown off, so he reaches for another slur. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre probably gay.‚Äù I mean, duh. I‚Äôm a masculine-presenting, cis gendered lesbian. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs obvious to him.

I look at him, grin, and say, ‚ÄúHa! I‚Äôm a huge lesbian. What‚Äôs that got to do with anything?‚Äù That earns me a ‚ÄúF8gg0t!‚Äù shouted with glee from the guy. Like he‚Äôs been waiting yearsssssss to yell it at someone in public.

I laugh and tell him to keep saying it, adding, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve probably got a lot of them pent up. I can take it. Maybe if you get them all out now, you‚Äôll leave the next person alone.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt know that it means nothing to me now. I reclaimed that one too. He keeps yelling, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a f8gg0t!!‚Äù over and over. C‚Äômon guy, new word‚Ä¶

Finally I say, ‚ÄúIt just means I eat [kitty cat]. So what?‚Äù That one really makes him twitch. I can almost see the disgust curdling in his stomach.

He tells me to read the Bible. I tell him I have. (I haven‚Äôt.) He tells me that I should stop living in my van, stop coming around, stop being visible. He‚Äôs annoyed my van windows are covered. I remind him‚Ä¶dogs.

Then he says, seemingly out of nowhere, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm OK hitting you.‚Äù

Ha! ‚ÄúHave YOU read the Bible?! Wow.‚Äù

But that one hits different. Am I about to punch someone? I freeze. My body hurts too much for a real fight. I‚Äôve had a hip replacement, back surgery, carpel tunnel surgeries‚Ä¶all of it. Plus, my phone‚Äôs in the van. Great.

I take a few steps forward anyway, like I have been this whole time, stand tall, and say with a little giggle, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre afraid of a f8gg0t? Got it.‚Äù

He repeats that he‚Äôd be OK hitting me ‚Äúin self-defense.‚Äù Self-defense from what? A queer woman existing? Ok guy.

I decide I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt cure this guy‚Äôs homophobia. I walk back to my van. Someone from an upstairs window (finally) yells something. I can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre defending me or just telling us to shut up.

I got in the van and sobbed (I didn‚Äôt let him see me cry). Not because I was scared of him, but because I‚Äôm tired of fighting to exist. I‚Äôm tired of proving I belong. I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I won‚Äôt shrink so someone else can feel big. My van, my body, my queerness‚Ä¶they‚Äôre not up for debate.

His world might be getting meaner, but mine is getting braver.

TL;DR I was yelled at and called slurs by a man in a MAGA hat while dog-sitting in Wash Park; he threatened he‚Äôd be ‚ÄúOK hitting‚Äù me. I walked away, but not after standing my ground.",27,1761060020.0,DenverProtests,6,0.89,False

There's zero flirting, literally nothing like that.

My boyfriend met him once and everything seemed fine. But later that night he said he doesn't think it's appropriate that I keep hanging out one-on-one with another guy, regardless of orientation. When I reminded him my coworkter is gay, he said that it's still about boundaries, it just doesnt look right.

Since then he's made a few passive-aggressive comments about him. It's making me uncomfortable because I feel like I'm being treated as if I'm doing something wrong when I'm not. He insists it's not jealousy, just respect, but I think it's BS.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on with my gut. I don‚Äôt seem to have all the *typical* IBS symptoms, so I‚Äôm wondering, **what could my symptoms mean?**

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I often feel **gurgling** in my gut and **strong urgency** after eating fatty meals ‚Äî especially in the morning.
* Fats are better tolerated at lunch or dinner.
* I don't have greasy floating stools
* I see food particles on my stools since the very beginning of my symptoms more than 2 months ago
* My gut feels **hypersensitive**, but I **don‚Äôt have abdominal pain** anymore.
* I don‚Äôt have diarrhea, just **irregular bowel movements** whenever I eat a triggering food (like caffeine).
* I‚Äôm still mostly stuck on a **Low FODMAP diet**, because almost anything else brings back urgency or an exaggerated gastrocolic reflex.



**Background:**

I‚Äôve had constipation for years (type 1‚Äì2 on the Bristol scale, once a day). About 8 months ago, I started feeling **strong urgency** and **mild abdominal pain** every couple of weeks. Then I was having 2‚Äì3 bowel movements a day, which for me felt perfect.

Things got worse in August after drinking two coffees on an empty stomach. That day I had gut gurgling, pain, urgency, and diarrhea after lunch, and since then, my digestion hasn‚Äôt been the same.

I‚Äôve had a **CT scan and endoscopy**, both normal. No H. pylori, no gastritis. The GI diagnosed me with **Functional Dyspepsia**, but I feel like not all my symptoms were considered. He prescribed a PPI for a month and a half to let my stomach sensibility decrease but I don't think that worked at all, I mean I can eat much more now, with less sensitivity but while on PPIs I still had sensibility.



**Where I am now (Oct 21):**

* No abdominal pain since late August
* I can move normally after meals
* Still on a low-FODMAP diet
* Fatty foods still trigger urgency and some gurgling
* Taking probiotics, glutamine, psyllium husk, and other supplements



Would love to hear your thoughts. **Does this sound like IBS, or something else such as gut hypersensitivity, post-infectious IBS, or bile acid issues?**",1,1761059973.0,ibs,0,1.0,False
1ocfrmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1ocfrmh/small_rant_about_the_unacceptably_bad_gameplay_in/,Small Rant about the unacceptably bad gameplay in WuWa's story quests,"Edit: Okay its NOT a small rant, sorry for that :D



So I finally had the time to catch up with the 2.6 story of Augusta and Iuno and to be honest: I don't know if i want to continue this. Not because of the story itself, which was quite nice, a bit overly dragged out but nice.

BUT holy shit what was that gameplay during these missions. If you can even call it that. And this is a trend I see for quite some time now in WuWa MSQ.

95% of gameplay in story quests now is either:

* press F to enter the next dialogue/cutscene
* run a maximum of 5 meters to enter the next dialogue/cutscene
* press T for the scanner to activate the script trigger to continue the quest
* run from one point to another but careful: if you miss one by 2 meters you gotta run back to trigger the script
* click through heaps of dialogue followed by even more dialogue, some of which is quite bland
* press some buttons or drag the mouse to progress the cutscene, like COME ON! 2010 called and said it wants its outdated quick time events back.

Hell there is probably more. Even the handholding mechanic with Iuno which seemed like a nice feature just WASNT. I imagined we needed to fight or reach certain spots without her and the timer and/or positioning Iuno right would matter but NOPE! It didnt even come up once and got thrown out the window after like 5 minutes. Meaningful decisions? Nowhere to be found. Figuring stuff out by yourself, actually 'playing around'? Fuck that i guess.

And dont get me started on the auto-play sequences. It was at its worst in the Cartethyia bits in i think it was 2.4 where i realized i can just get myself a coffee while the action on screen happened without any need for input while still giving the illusion for needing said player input. Kuro apparently decided that a ""you failed, try again"" screen was too much of a traumatic experience for their audience to have and  just threw any and all challenge over board. Which brings me to my last point...

The battles. And I wanna emphasize on my disgust for them here: HOLY SHIT. Its so bad. We just cant lose at all now can we? Its either mindlessly slicing through grunts that explode after a few hits or in the few good boss fights (and i love the bosses in this game, they are quite challenging in design) you just can't fucking die? Your HP cant drop below 1 in the fight with the Souvereign. And apparently its also just a fight on a timer. So if you just stand there watching him annihalate you, the game will just cut away from the carnage after a while and bring you the typical rover+limited character aura farmin cutscene. Battling in this game is often promoted as THE core feature that is well designed and then we cant even have that in the main story?

I don't ask for a souls like experience where I get my face smashed dozens of times before I git gud enough to progress but i most certainly WILL ask for some challenge. Make it...losable. Make me repeat a certain action, QTE (if you so crave to include that shit) or fight if i get too clumsy or distracted by my second monitor content. (that i am forced to watch because apparently I cant be bothered with actually playing the game)

Are there exceptions to the attrocious gameplay we see most of the time? Yes but its far and few between and most of the time is either underdeveloped or leads nowhere meaningful. Sooo...

...Where does this rant lead to: Actually nowhere. I carry this frustration with me for a few patches now and it was the reason why I had an extended pause (about 2 months) from the game. Now that i am back and have my thoughts on the matter clear i decided to share them here (probably to bleed some karma) in the hopes of finding likeminded souls or good advice about how to endure the shitty gameplay without losing my drive to play the game again because outside of story quests, gameplay is fire IMO.

Anyways, thanks for reading the full rant.

TLDR: Gameplay during story quests fucking sucks, you just press F or run a few meters inbetween cutscenes, you cant fail at anything, battles are laughably easy and you cant even lose. Shit sucks but i like the game outside of the quest gameplay.",0,1761059928.0,WutheringWaves,28,0.37,False

I‚Äôm supposed to go to work and pretend I‚Äôm ok when I‚Äôm not. I can‚Äôt stop crying all day everyday . Besides being traumatized by wat happened ‚Ä¶ I also have to kill off a part of myself that I enjoyed , a part of myself that I used to cope with life .. I looked forward to parties, I looked forward to taking drugs .. I didn‚Äôt take too much, I know friends who have taken so much more than me. I cannot get over this and I don‚Äôt know how I will.. I feel like my life has ended , I can‚Äôt even remember how life felt before this.. as shit as my life was before , I miss my old self , the self that didn‚Äôt have to be so careful.. now I‚Äôm scared to even drink a coffee. I‚Äôm writing here to maybe make some friends who also experienced a drug induced seizure as right now I feel so alone and so scared..

Hoping some of you seasoned pros can help a relatively new home roaster out. I've been trying my hand at Mexican Chiapas, and I'm using an SR800 with an extension tube, hooked up to Phidgets for data logging into Artisan.

I've done a few roasts, and while some are drinkable, I'm pretty sure I'm making some obvious mistakes, especially looking at my Artisan graphs.

Here's my main concern: Understanding the **Delta BT (Bean Temperature Rate of Rise)** curve. I suspect my settings or adjustments are off.

I'll be attaching an Artisan graph from a recent roast in the comments (or directly in the post if allowed).

**My typical process (and where I suspect issues lie):**

* **Charge:** Around 220 green beans. (Indoors)
* **Initial Power:** Usually 3 first few minutes then increase it upto 6
* **Fan:** Start at 9, drop to 7-6

**What specific settings or strategies should I be looking at to get a smoother RoR and better control, especially with this particular bean?**

* **Fan settings:** Should I be more aggressive or gentler? When?
* **Power adjustments:** Am I not giving enough power? What's a good ""increment"" to adjust by (e.g., 0.5, 1.0 unit)?
* **Charge size:** Is 220g too much for trying to control the SR800 with an extension?
* **Anything else**?

Any guidance, tips, or specific Artisan settings/approaches for the SR800 + extension tube would be massively appreciated!

Thank you Finger Lakes hive, no matter how many Posts for trip requests you get here you take the time to answer without the snark of almost all other tourist Subs  Were a couple the wrong side of 60 but still active. From the recommendations here. Robert Treman State was our first hike after a 4 hour car ride. What a fun hike. The leaves were probably 80 percent peak. The waterfalls weren't flowing to hard probably because of the dry conditions in the northeast. We checked in at the hotel in Geneva and ended up driving to Parkers on the Fall in Seneca Falls. We had a really good dinner and would go back.

We got up early and had breakfast at Bagels and Cakes. Really good coffee and breakfast sandwiches. So much better than a hotel breakfast. Went to Watkins Glen and had the trail almost to ourselves. If you are reading this and live in the area you truly live in a beautiful place. Don't take for granted the natural wonders in your backyard.

Now to the wineries. Rather than taking a place down because an employee may have been having a rough day. I'll talk about our really nice times.

Toast Winery. By far it was our most enjoyable visit. Lori ? was our host and she could not have been more engaging. From the descriptions o the wines to the history of the vineyard se was fun. We enjoyed the wine more probably because of her. 

Barnstormer. We chose this because of this Sub. Unfortunately Art wasn't there. But, Kelly was  terrific giving a really crowded room as much individual attention as if it was empty. We spent the afternoon sitting in the afternoon sun watching the machinery turning the grapes into the wine!

We ended the night at the Deluxe Grill. It's as Old School red gravy Italian restaurant as it gets. We enjoyed the Parmesan dishes  and pasta. Like a friends  house on Sunday.

Before leaving we had our last breakfast at the Water Street Cafe. It was a fun breakfast to end the trip.

Not sure if we can make it up as soon as we would like. I'll definitely use this Sub for future trips. Thanks for reading.",8,1761059655.0,FingerLakes,0,1.0,False

I guess to begin with, l'd love to meet you and cuddle. BUT we both are random people on the internet. So let's take our time to get to know one another. Im not saying that we need to wait months on end but like a week or so. Or until you are comfortable with meeting.

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I make a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie. There is probably more to that list but I just can't think of everything.

I can‚Äôt counsel you on your taxes or life choices, but I can guarantee you that $CRO is about to stampede through the rooftop and demolish the moon. Strap in, because this bull run is more bouncy than a kangaroo on espresso!

Whale Stampede in Progress
The richest 50 wallets just gobbled up 35 million CRO in the last 12 hours. That‚Äôs not accumulation‚Äîthat‚Äôs a straight-up feeding frenzy. Meanwhile, retail is still debating which pizza topping to order. Buys are hitting order books harder than a hipster drops avocados on toast.

Chain Upgrades Unleashed
Cronos v1.6 just rolled out quantum-grade node optimizations‚Äîblock times now under 300ms, gas fees cut by 80%, and cross-chain bridges live for BTC, ETH, and DOGE. Devs are deploying like they just discovered caffeine. If you‚Äôre on anything else, you might as well be stuck on dial-up.

Global Partnerships Explode
Yesterday, three major national banks (including one in the G10) signed MOUs for CRO-backed yield products. Those aren‚Äôt press releases‚Äîthey‚Äôre corporate titans lining up to plug CRO into retirement accounts, payroll, and even mortgage settlements. Grandma‚Äôs pension is getting a crypto glow-up!

Insane Staking Bonanza
Crypto.com just launched ‚ÄúHyperLevel Up‚Äù‚Äînow up to 15% APR in CRO with instant liquidity and tiered token airdrops. If you stake 1,000 CRO, you can get a retro-style GameBoy in limited edition gold CRO skin. Diamond hands? Try diamond GameBoys.

‚ÄúMoon Mission‚Äù Technical Setup

Broke through $0.50 resistance like a buzzsaw through butter.

RSI has moonburn mode: currently a flat-lined 87, begging for profit-taking but supply is non-existent.

Fibonacci calls look like snail tracks to $1.11, then $2.22, because symmetry, baby.

Meme Magic: CRO Flamingos
The CRO Flamingos NFT series just sold out in 47 seconds, generating 4,200 ETH in royalties. Nothing says ‚Äúchain hype‚Äù like flamingo avatars flocking to your PFP, squawking ‚ÄúHODL!‚Äù at every dip.

The FOMO Forecast
By Halloween, expect $CRO price alerts to be scarier than any haunted house. Retails margins are collapsing, YOLO bots are whirring, and the next green candle will spark a global panic BUY like midnight Black Friday on Amazon Prime Day.

I‚Äôm not here for petty 2x gains. I want to witness the moment CRO trades at $5 while the financial news anchors choke on their coffee. I‚Äôll be chilling on my CRO-themed hoverboard, sipping a $42 handcrafted unicorn latte, and live-tweeting the newbie meltdown.

You‚Äôve been warned. The bull is out, the whales are here, and the only real question is: are you on the CHAOS TRAIN or still waiting for boarding calls? üöÄü¶Å‚ú®",3,1761059593.0,cro,23,0.54,False

He always asks how im feeling and if I say im just fine he calls me out on the lie and tells me I can vent to him. Those are some in person examples. The texting is where I start to get confused, and maybe its cause its not the same as an in person interaction. Originally I had given him my number so that we could plan to get coffee(not that I don't want to talk either lol) but he offered for me to vent so I used that as an in to ask him out and he said yes and we can plan it.

*By The Sportswriter with a Sense of Humor (and a Spreadsheet)*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Offenses**  
Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: Louisiana Tech‚Äôs defense is the NBA‚Äôs \[insert name here\]‚Äîelite, but only if you ignore the last 10 seconds of the 4th quarter. The Bulldogs rank **first in scoring defense (17.2 PPG allowed)**, which sounds terrifying until you realize Western Kentucky‚Äôs offense is a leaky faucet. The Hilltoppers managed **6 points in their last loss**, and their 19.8 PPG ranks 129th in FBS. But here‚Äôs the twist: WKU‚Äôs QB, **Maverick McIvor** (1,863 yards, 12 TDs), is a magician with a football, and their balanced backfield (led by **Deshon Smith**, 722 yards) could exploit a Bulldogs defense that‚Äôs *terrible* at stopping the run (114th in rushing D, 169.8 YPG allowed).

Meanwhile, Louisiana Tech‚Äôs QB, **Blake Baker**, is listed as **day-to-day** after a mysterious ‚Äúhip flexor‚Äù that‚Äôs suspiciously familiar to a broken coffee machine at 8 a.m. on game day. If he‚Äôs hobbled, the Bulldogs‚Äô offense‚Äîa team that averages just 24.5 PPG‚Äîmight resemble a toddler‚Äôs attempt at a souffl√©: ambitious, but destined to collapse.

**Implied Probabilities**:

* **Louisiana Tech -3.5 (-110)**: Implied win probability ‚âà **52.4%**.
* **Western Kentucky +3.5 (-110)**: Implied win probability ‚âà **47.6%**.  
The line is tight, but the math suggests this is a toss-up.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Road Magic, and Punting Prowess**

* **Western Kentucky‚Äôs Secret Sauce**: The Hilltoppers have **covered the spread in their last four road games**, a streak that defies logic and physics. Their defense allows just **35.1% third-down conversions**, which is impressive until you realize they‚Äôre playing against teams that throw up on the sidelines before kickoff.
* **Special Teams Shenanigans**: WKU‚Äôs punter, **Cole Maynard**, is a human GPS for bad field position. His 43.2-yard average and 38.5 net yards per punt could force Louisiana Tech into 4th-and-27 situations, where their offense will either panic or attempt a flea flicker.

I‚Äôve seen a few¬†coffee DAOs¬†pop up in the past - and most of them ended up shutting down. After looking into it, I think the main reason they failed was¬†overcomplicating things with unnecessary blockchain integrations.

Here‚Äôs the simple idea I want to brainstorm with you:

Imagine a¬†coffee shop that actually operates as a DAO.

* The DAO raises an initial fund - say,¬†$20k¬†- to cover setup costs: coffee machine, supplies (cups, syrups, beans), and 6 months of rent upfront.
* People who buy tokens get¬†a share of profits¬†and¬†voting rights¬†(if they want to participate).

Now, here‚Äôs where the DAO structure really shines:  
We build an¬†open accounting system¬†where every expense and sale is recorded publicly.  
When someone buys a cup of coffee, anyone can see:

* how much was spent on beans,
* how much went to taxes, electricity, labor,
* and what the profit margin was.

Some might say this level of transparency kills competitive advantage - but come on, it‚Äôs a coffee shop, not an AI hardware company.

If this works, we wouldn‚Äôt just have a functioning business - we‚Äôd have a¬†blueprint for decentralized franchises: a model others can copy to start their own DAO coffee shops.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Prediction: Dallas Stars vs. Columbus Blue Jackets ‚Äì A ""Hot"" Streak Meets a ""Cold"" Streak (But Who‚Äôs Hotter?)**

The Dallas Stars (-206 ML) are favored to end their two-game skid against the Columbus Blue Jackets (+169 ML), but let‚Äôs be honest: this feels like a bet on a sunrise. The Stars are *technically* the fifth-ranked shooting team (13.4% SG%) and boast Jake Oettinger‚Äôs .905 SV%, but their recent play has been as inconsistent as a Zamboni on a coffee break. Meanwhile, Columbus is a bottom-feeding offense (2.8 GPG, 25th in 8.9% SG%), but Kirill Marchenko is on a *ridiculous* five-game goal streak‚Äîlike a caffeinated squirrel with a slapshot.

**Key Stats to Know:**

* **Dallas** allows 3.6 GPG (17th) but averages 21.2 hits/game (second). Their ""defense"" is basically a group of very tall, very confused librarians.
* **Columbus** has a +1 goal differential in road games but -1 overall. They‚Äôre like a tourist in Dallas: here for the steak, but lost in the parking lot.
* **Injuries**: Both teams have more players on the IR than in the lineup. Dallas is missing Benn, Krys, and Lundkvist; Columbus is without Gudbranson and Wood. It‚Äôs a medical convention out there.

**Odds Breakdown:**

* **Moneyline**: Dallas (-206) implies a 67.3% win chance. Columbus (+169) implies 37.2%. The math checks out if you assume the Stars are just mathematically *allowed* to win.
* **Puck Line**: Dallas -1.5 (+180) is a ‚Äúbet they cover‚Äù play for gam

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

**Some of my hobbies:**¬†I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

If you made it until the end thank you :) I'll let you on a little secret before you go!

1ocevyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/distractible/comments/1ocevyp/oops_all_wheels/,Oops All Wheels!,"Basically as the name suggests, the contestents only get true points from wheel spins for this idea. 

  
The host would be ideally Bob for wheel spin fairness, and in my head, the karmic resetting of the wheel. 

**Main idea:** 

So the boys would still get points all throughout the episode. Transition points, points for being on topic, points for agreeing with the host. And for this idea I was thinking it could be towards the end of the season for the maximum amount of wheel spin options. But how they get the points doesnt matter, They can do bit trivia, word games, anything. 

Another Riddle Realm type episode would be perfect, though, for this instance. But truly, any word game or anything would work. 

**The Twist:** 

The twist is that at the end, the points are turned into wheel spins, and those wheel spins will turn into main wheel spins, which turn into true points. 

First spin has 1 - 3 spins chances like usual

Then the main wheel is from the bits/the wheel they add to at the end of each episode. 

True points are based on the wheel spin points only. 

***Let me set the stage for an example.*** 

Say Bob is hosting so Mark and Wade are the contestants. After the game, they end off with: 

Mark at 5 points

Wade at 6 points

So then they will spin the first wheel, 5 times for Mark, 6 times for Wade. 

*While spinning wheel #1:* 

Mark's 5 points turn into: 2,3,2,1,3= 11 main wheel spins

Wade's 6 points turn into: 1,2,2,3,1= 9 main wheel spins. 

*They then spin the main wheel for true points.* 

So say the first spin is points for viewers, then the viewer gets a point, the next one is most impressions, whoever did more impressions that game gets the points, etc, etc, until the winner is chosen. So it's a complete toss-up until the VERY VERY END. 

This gives Viewers, Watchers, Chica, whoever gets points in the episode, that equates to wheel spins, the opportunity to be on the board and COULD WIN THE EPISODE. 

We could also get a tie, or golf rules, one-man show, or literally anything the wheel could throw at us, which I think would be super entertaining to listen to and watch in real time. Just all three boys at the edge of their seats to see what the wheel of fate decides. 

This was a morning before coffee idea, so I know it's not perfect, but I think it has the bones to be a good episode. If there's anything you would add, feel free to let me know!

Looking for a TON of GUIDANCE.,"Hello, I am going on a budget trip to China with my family. I have never been to China before actually. I will be staying at the Wangfujing area and in Jinniu district at Chengdu. I want to make the most out of it. One of the main reasons I made the plan to go visit China was to buy a gaming laptop at the 11-11 sale, I decided I will go to a JD store in Zhongguancun, how can I secure a killer deal? My mother also wants to buy a cheap/ 2nd hand coffee machine and a mini vacuum cleaner, where can I get that? Also we want to visit a huge fake market for bags, watches and clothes, I'm aware that most of them are extinct in Beijing, so Chengdu markets are good too. I myself want to buy a high quality but still affordable leather belt and wallet(does not have to be fake/ripoff), where can I get that I still have no clue. I really have no idea of the things to do in China, especially about Chengdu. I made my itinerary with help from YouTube. We decided to go to Chengdu because mom really wanted to go to the Xiling Snow Mountain. My friend who is studying in Shenzhen suggested me to try Wallace & Tastien burgers and HeHeGu, tell me about these please. I do not eat pork. What is there to buy and eat and try at China? For example everyone gets Ya Dom( a herbal inhaler) when they go to Thailand and eat mango sticky rice, drink thai Redbull and as for ""activities"" participate with p\*\*\*titues(which I am not interested in or expecting) so what is the equivalent of these in China?. A little info about me: I'm 17, a student big into pop culture(movies,shows<games, etc.,). Please bestow me with knowledge and tips. 

# A few straight questions:

1.  Where to hang chill and eat in Wangfujing? I heard the street food is really nice there.
2. Same question as Q1. but for Jinniu District at Chengdu
3. What am I missing out on?
4. Must try/see things.

6. Shopping tips.
7. What is overrated?/Should Skip

1ocetot,https://brump.it,I built an app for people with busy brains to help organize all of that chaos.,"Hey everyone, my name is Dane, and I built the web & mobile (available on iOS for now) app, Brump.  



What is Brump? 



Brain + Dump = Brump 



Think of Brump as a butler for your brain.  Or a personal assistant that just keeps you organized and on track.  



It's an app that allows you to quickly dump your thoughts (short thoughts, long thoughts, all the thoughts) and utilizes AI to auto suggest (or add) tags to your brumps for easy recall later.  You can search your history of brumps by keyword(s) or by date.  You can sort your keywords by most used, or most recent.  



Every brump that you enter into the app is fully encrypted server side with AES256 encryption protocols.  I had a vision of this app being utilized in the mental health space and I knew that I needed to setup a solid foundation of encryption if I wanted to play in that space.  Even though I am the only person with access to my database, 1) I did NOT want to see what was going through peoples brains, and 2) I wanted users to feel safe using this app and for it to become a safe space to let all their chaotic thoughts out.  



The newest feature that I've recently built (and launching today) is the swipe --> task feature.  All of your recent brumps are turned into flash cards that you can swipe left/right on them.  



Swiping right turns that brump into a task. 

Swiping left discards/ignores that brump. 



You can then go into the task page and see all the tasks that you've created for yourself, and also be able to filter your tasks by the keywords associated with that brump, or by importance level, or by date.  



You can also export your brumps (JSON code) to dump into your ChatGPT / LLM if you utilize AI for self reflection / personal growth / life organization as well.  



**Future features that I am currently building / testing right now are:** 



*Therapy Mode* | The app uses AI to scan all of your brumps from the previous X number of days (typically since your last therapist session) and creates a quick summary of what's been going on in your world that you can give to your therapist.  It doesn't add its own opinion, brump summarizes what you've brumped recently.  No longer do you have to spend the first 5-10 minutes of your therapist session trying to recall anything and everything that's happened over the last 7-14+ days of your life, you can now walk into your therapy session with a summary to give to your therapist and dive right in.  



I have tested this myself personally with my own therapist and she's blown away every time we chat because I literally hand her a map of what's happened and she can pick and choose where we start.  



*Coffee Mode* | Similar to therapy mode, brump will scan all of your brumps from the last \_\_\_ days/weeks/months since the last time you updated a friend on what's going on in life.  It will spit back out a summary list that you can use as a guide to update your friend(s) on so you're not bouncing around and potentially skipping the juicy tea that they're excited to hear about. 



*Journal Mode* | For those that enjoy journaling, I plan on utilizing AI to scan your brumps and suggest custom journal prompts for you to expand further on.  Every prompt will be tailored to the user, no cookie cutter bullshit here.  



**Why I built Brump** | I built Brump as a brain dump app for myself.  I wanted an app that I could use to help with my ADHD and all the random thoughts that I have floating in my head 24/7.  After building it, I showed it off to a few friends and they asked me, ""how can I use this app?!"" and that's when I realized that I needed to build this into something other like minded people such as myself could utilize.  



Sure - I could have just used the notes app on my iPhone, and I did for the a long long time.  Or, I could have just written my thoughts down on paper.  But, when I dumped a thought into my notes app, it became buried under every other note that I would add throughout the day, and I would just forget about it.  And I have chicken scratch for handwriting.  Those paper notes would definitely get lost in my pocket or kitchen counter.  



Sure - I could have used my ChatGPT to dump my thoughts into and log them into memory, but, ChatGPT doesn't shut up unless you specifically tell it to every single time you send a message.  It always responds to you, and I didn't want that happening when my main goal / focus was to just clear my brain. 



Brump doesn't respond, it absorbs.  Brump doesn't lose your thoughts, it organizes them for you.  



**About me** | I'm a recently divorced single dad with a career / background in Mortgages and Sales, and also push shit around for the post office in the mornings.  This is the 2nd app that I have built, but the first app I've built to completion and distribution.  The first app I built got back burnered as soon as I realized the opportunity that Brump had. I built the first iteration of Brump on 08/25/25.  It's come a far way in 2 months.  



Just as of a little over 24 hours ago, Brump Mobile (v1) was approved for Apple App Store which has been a huge highlight in my journey of building brump.  I have the Android version built but am still in need of Android users for Internal testing before I can apply for production on Google Play Console.  You can find the app in Apple App Store, or you can head over to [https://brump.it/download](https://brump.it/download) as well. 



**Some known bugs that I am actively working on fixing:** 

* If you sign up via Google or Facebook login via the web (ie: going to [www.brump.it](http://www.brump.it) vs signing up through the app), you will need to know your email and password combo for that service in order to sign in through the mobile app.  I've been having hiccups in getting the authorize token back into the app to login so I disabled Google/Facebook Sign In via the app temporarily. 
* If you don't use the app for an extended period (15+ minutes of it being closed on your phone), when you open the app, it'll just load up a white screen.  You'll need to force reset the app and then re-open it.  I'm pushing an update today that will fix this, I just wanted to get this post up first lol.  



Anyway, I appreciate you reading my novel and I hope that this app helps someone organize the chaos that's in their brain.  It has been a massive game changer for me, and a lot of other users have expressed the same.  I'm extremely proud of what I've built and I look forward to any and all feedback from new users!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Hello all, I want to thank those who read my previous statement and are back to read more of my findings. For those who didn't read my previous post, I am a research agent for an organisation that I'm not allowed to name, and I've been given permission to post (albeit censored) statements of some of my findings.

I am doing this in the hopes that, well, something will be left of me if I don't keep ahead of what's hunting me.

Anyways, the story begins a few months after the bus incident. Me and Lily were being punished for using a very rare and very expensive piece of equipment, and our punishment was what we like to call in the biz ‚Äúcampfire duty‚Äù.

My organisation specialises in the investigation and regulation of any and all paranormal entities, sites or events; we have our ear to the ground and finger in every pie. This makes it so we are capable of investigating as many myths or legends as possible to verify if they're genuine.

This also includes all of the stories that are clearly made up and are told to spook teenagers; this is campfire duty. And it's horribly embarrassing.

I won't go into what we investigated, but to anyone who likes spreading urban legends about ghosts that appear when you drive along roads late at night, I hope you realise how much time you waste for some poor research agent who actually has to drive up and down that road for hours multiple nights a week.

It was early in the morning when I first got to work, an unlabelled office building in a part of a central business district that you'd never notice. I had a coffee in my hand and a filled-out dossier in the other; it was for an urban legend that could finally be filed under ‚ÄúMyth‚Äù. I got to my desk cubicle and discovered that another dossier was left on my keyboard.

A new assignment before I even submitted the one in my hands, I finished the coffee and sat in my chair to begin reading.

‚ÄúThe Shadow Man‚Äù was a Type A Spectre who roams around the halls of a ‚ÄúSpringview motel‚Äù. This was shaping up to be another campfire case, but you have to do what you have to do.

A few hours later, Lily and I were driving down a highway in the middle of an empty open field that stretched out indefinitely.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of this, Lily. If they want us running around chasing chickens, they should at least make them interesting. This shadow man,"" I said, almost scoffing when saying the name, ""doesn't even sound original,"" I continued.

""If you hate it so much, why don't you leave?"" she responded in a nonchalant tone. I often forgot that our roles within the organisation were very different. I was free to complain about the assignments I'd been put on, and I was also free to quit at any time. Lily didn't have that freedom.

It was a good question, one I didn't have an answer to. Before things got awkward, we pulled off of the road and into the car park of a nice-looking motel.

""Y'know, in terms of chickens to chase, this doesn't seem that bad; it might even just be an all-expenses-paid holiday,"" Lily said with a slight sense of excitement in her voice.

We got out of the car and walked to the entry of the motel. Sitting behind the front desk was an early twenties guy playing something on his phone. I walked up and placed my hand on the counter.

""Hi, we've got two rooms booked under a Mr Moore,"" I said. The staff member looked up at me from his phone and had a visibly annoyed look.

""Yeah, let me check,"" he said slowly as he shifted to the computer beside him. After a moment, he scanned some keycards and placed them on the desk. ""Please enjoy your stay,"" he added before jumping back onto his phone.

We walked up a flight of stairs and found our rooms. They were next to each other like always; it was the usual setup: twin-sized bed, desk, small kitchenette and bathroom.

I set my bag at the foot of the bed and took a seat atop it. I had my dossier in my hands and read over the specifics: a ""Shadowman"" would appear when you least expect and take people. I groaned at the cheesiness. A few hours had passed, and the sun had long since set. Lily was in my room, and we were, for all intents and purposes, just shooting the shit.

We had ordered pizza, and Lily had driven out and bought some beer; to be fair to her, things were shaping up to just being a vacation paid for by the organisation. something we both desperately needed.

Eventually Lily called it a night, and I got into some pyjamas and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. The bathroom wasn't the best, but I've also been in worse. Imagine a shitty tub and shower curtain, a brown toilet and a sink with a mirror-shelf cabinet just above it.

I wet my toothbrush and began to scrub my teeth. I spat my spit back into the sink and looked in the mirror and realised something: there was a handprint on the other side of the shower curtain.

My heart sank, but I remembered my training. I turned around and kept my eyes on it. The handprint was slowly moving closer, as if whoever was on the other side was reaching out to me.

""Shit,"" I whispered in an instinctual slip.

As I said this, Silent black flames burst from behind the shower curtain, licking up the walls. No heat. No light. Just darkness moving like fire. I ran to the door and almost threw myself through it. I dove for my bag. The bathroom was an inferno of silent abyss, black fire licking the air. dancing atop each other, whilst a man made of black flames stepped out from behind the shower curtain slowly.

""FUCK!"" I remember screaming at the top of my lungs as the shadow man turned its head towards me. I grabbed out a small bag of silver halide, poured it into my hand, and threw it at the shadow man, but it fell through him.

The black flames had begun to spread into my motel room, and I began to run to my motel door. As I reached for the door, the flames shot up the doorframe, and I jumped at the sudden movement. The flames remained silent, and the sound of my heart beating may very well have been the loudest thing in the room.

As the shadow man advanced, my breath caught in my throat. Suddenly, the motel door slammed open. Lily burst inside, her hands thrust forward like a shield. The dark figure recoiled, its fiery form folding in on itself, retreating back into the bathroom‚Äôs shadows.

Lily was swooning on her feet, and I leapt forward to grab her as she fell, and I dragged us both out of the room. I dragged her to her car, and as soon as we entered, she fell asleep. I was in no mood to re-enter the motel room, so I joined her.

The next morning we got breakfast at a diner a few minutes' drive down the road. It was awkward and tense, but I thought we needed to debrief about our situation.

""So what do you think that was last night?"" I asked sheepishly.

""The fucking shadowman, I guess,"" she responded before taking a deep sip of her orange juice. I took note that it wasn't coffee.

""How did you know to come and help me? The fire wasn't hot or noisy. I know I shouted a bit, but surely not that loud,"" I said as jokingly as I could, which rewarded me with a smile.

""First off, yeah, you do scream that loud; secondly, I don't know how I couldn't have felt it. It felt like a bomb went off in my head,"" she finished with a head shake. ""Whatever this is, Elijah is strong,"" she continued, which I shook my head in agreement with.

""Yeah, it didn't even flinch at a handful of silver halide,"" I confessed.

She looked at me again. ""How many things do you know that can do that?"" she asked, already knowing the answer.

""Not many, not your usual type A spectre at least,"" I said. A waitress walked up to our table and placed our breakfasts in front of us: eggs on toast with a side of beans for me and banana pancakes for Lily. I must've been giving her a look because she spoke up and said, ""Shut up. The last time I had to use that much energy was when we were on the bus, coincidentally when I was saving your ass again.""

I shot her a playful look and took a sip of my coffee.

""Okay, so type A are just basic apparitions, right?"" Lily said in inbetween mouthfulls of pancakes.

""Yeah, usually your normal ghost archetype, humanoid, glowing, translucent,"" I said whilst cutting my toast.

""Right,"" she said whilst pointing a fork at me; the fork had a banana on the end of it.

""Elijah, that thing only fell under one of those; it's a stretch to call it a type A, and it's nowhere near a type P,"" she added.

""Ok, so what are you saying? This is something new?"" I said, confused,

""No, not at all. In this line of work you'll learn that there is never anything new, just things we haven't learnt of yet. What I'm saying is that I don't think this thing comes from a soul like a spectre would; I think it's something else,"" she added before chewing down another mixture of banana, pancake, chocolate and orange juice.

""Ok, so what do you propose?"" I asked.

""I don't know at the moment; I have some questions I want to ask, like why did it target you on the very first night?, Usually they spend as much time scoping us out as we scope them, but we have to practise the Heinz tried-and-true method of throwing whatever we have at it night after night until we understand that bastard,"" she said before presenting her newly finished plate of pancakes.  

Eight long, excruciating nights of nothing; the Shadowman had gone silent, and if it wasn't for Lily also seeing him, I would've begun to believe that I imagined the whole thing. I couldn't help but feel that throughout those long 8 nights a sense of being watched, like I had never felt like I was truly alone in that place.

I felt more comfortable being alone within the motel, and I was allocated the very noble role of ""vending machine trader"", which meant I'd just go and get us snacks whenever we were both hungry. I honestly think that motel may have seen more revenue from their vending machine in the time we were there than the entire time they were open.

We'd both seen flickers of black flames appearing and disappearing throughout this period of time, but we both couldn't confidently say if it was reality or a trick conjured by our minds; living off of fumes you don't have and rarely sleeping can do cruel things to your psyche. In my line of work, trusting what your gut tells you is real is incredibly important, so I can't genuinely say if the black embers were real or not. It doesn't really impact much, I guess.

I didn't sleep much that week; the times when I did sleep, I would need to borrow Lily's car and drive somewhere else. For the time I did try to sleep in the motel, I dreamt of the flames and the Shadowman. He was engulfed in the silent fire, and he was always wanting something from me, but I could never guess what. Lily woke me up before anything happened and began to sleep in her car.

I was on vending machine duty on the ninth night of our investigation, and I passed the staff member behind the front desk. He was playing on his phone like usual and didn't acknowledge me, like usual. It was past 2 a.m.; I couldn‚Äôt blame him for looking half-dead. I grabbed a bottle of cola and chips and grabbed Lily her cookies and mineral water.

After the drinks popped out, I realised that the hair on my arms was standing up and I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, which in my line of work is a good indicator that something is wrong. I shot my head up and looked around me and saw it: the staff member behind the front desk was slumped back in his chair, and he was being engulfed in a quiet black flame‚Ä¶ In one moment he was there, and the next it had consumed him whole; he was gone.

""Dammit!"" I shouted and dropped the supplies from the vending machine. I ran immediately to the stairs that led to the motel rooms to meet back up with Lily. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I stepped into a dark spot in the room. It was 2 am, so it didn't look out of place, but as I stepped into it, I realised my mistake. A black arm made of fire shot out and gripped me by the throat and pulled me into the darkness, and everything went numb.

I was falling in the darkness, although it wasn't dark; I could make out each black ember around me in crisp detail, and I felt like I was experiencing everything through a state of tunnel vision and extreme focus.

I felt confused and foggy about what was happening, and I remember an extreme feeling of calm whilst I fell in this world of fire.

Suddenly my calm was disturbed by a flickering of light. I looked towards it, and it seemed to peel back the fire around it. I could see the silhouette of someone in that light, but I couldn't recognise who.

""Elijah‚Ä¶"" the voice cried out.

""Elijah, please‚Ä¶"" it continued.

It took me a second to realise that it was talking about me. ,

""Elijah, come to me please, for God's sake,"" the voice cried out once more.

I trusted the voice, and although I was falling, I felt the strength to move. I tried to swim in this abyss, and to my shock, I was able to move closer to the light.

""Yes, Elijah, keep coming,"" the voice shouted before crying out in pain. Suddenly the fire violently swarmed around the light, and I felt a resounding amount of hate from all around me. The silhouette dropped to her knees, and I continued to push myself forward even though it had become much harder.

I reached the ever-shrinking light and thrust my hand out and let it engulf me. In a moment I was in that realm of fire, and in the next I was at the motel lobby being flung across the room. Lily was flung a few feet away from me, and she looked exhausted. I looked towards the shadow that I had come out from and saw the Shadowman stepping out; silent black flames erupted off of him, and he seemed much angrier now. With every step flames shot out from his foot and infected the surrounding area; he was engulfing the entire motel. The air was cold despite the flames, and a faint smell of burnt sulfur filled my nostrils.

I got to my feet and ran to Lily. She was awake but not entirely well. I scooped her up and ran out of the lobby, the Shadowman not far behind us. As we reached her car, I threw her into the back seat and dived for the steering wheel.

I tried to turn on the ignition but froze as I realised that I didn't know where her keys were.

""FUCK!"" I shouted as I scrambled my hands all across her car to find her keys. After a moment, I looked up and saw it. The Shadow Man stood across the car park from us. I was terrified. We stared at one another for what felt like an eternity, then it clicked: he isn't moving.

He was bound to the motel, ofcourse how stupid could I be?

As I was thinking this, a spiky object hit the back of my head. I yelped in fear before looking down and seeing that they were Lily's car keys; she had thrown them at me. A second later we were speeding out of that parking lot and making our way into town.

The next morning we were back at the diner; I had my eggs, toast and beans, and Lily had her pancakes.

""So you just happened to step into the one shadow the Shadow Man was hiding in."" Lily said in a teasing voice, ""You really are the stupidest research agent in the history of research agents,"" she said before taking a scoop of ice cream and eating it. Today she asked for ice cream as well as banana pancakes as a reward for saving my life again.

""Yeah, and what happened to you, oh great hero?"" I said in a similarly mocking tone.

""Simple, I saw your sorry ass being pulled into the shadows and thought that if there was a way in, I could definitely open that way back up. It took a hell of a lot out of me, though; you put me through way too much, Wiltburrow,"" she said whilst waving her fork around. No banana today. I didn't tell her that I heard what she said or how concerned she really sounded.

""Ok, well, thank you. I owe you my life again. Let's move on. It looks like the Shadowman is bound to the hotel; it's not a spectre, and we can't exorcise what we don't know,"" I said.

""It seems like the motel is the issue,"" Lily said offhandedly.

""Yeah, well, it's not like we can get rid of the motel,"" I said. I looked at her and saw excitement in her eyes. It is surprisingly easy to wave around a badge and say that you need to evacuate a motel and then ""accidentally"" set it on fire; it only took a couple of hours to burn, and with most people evacuated, the fire department didn't learn about it until it was too late. It's fitting in a way: the Shadowman, a creature engulfed in black fire, is laid to rest in a blaze of glory.

Although I felt a lingering shiver on the site, we decided that after an extra week of surveillance that our job was finished here; officially the case remained open in case of more sightings, but unofficially it was out of our hands.

So do remember, if you find yourself staying at motels and decide to steer away from the light after sundown, do make sure you don't step too far into the shadows.",0,1761057443.0,stories,0,0.5,False

Some people got lucky, mostly those in planes; that one group of lottery winners on the space shuttle most certainly. I hadn‚Äôt even been awake, sleeping half naked on the coffee table after a belligerent night of shots and pot. Two of my teeth had been cracked by some apoplectic drunk, and the distinct absence of that pain juxtaposed by its violent return had startled me awake just after coming back to life.

December 25, 2028, all members of the human race died for 7 minutes and 41 seconds. For 7 minutes and 41 seconds, each member of the human race joined the choir in Heaven or the gulag of Hell. Some stayed there, their cars burned out with their corpses inside; planes fell like rain, keeping a combined 40 million people, if you count what the planes hit, dead. 20 some planes managed to return in time to secure the controls, but as of now- 50 days later- only 1 person from such flights is still alive. 

If you‚Äôd had statistics of our present a decade ago, you‚Äôd be lead to believe some disaster hither-to mad max must‚Äôve occurred to motivate 2.3 billion people to commit harmonized suicide; a desperate plea to esacape the condtion of the new world. True, it was a new world and quite a wicked one in contrast to the golden streets and flitting pearl gates, and true people were escaping it- so in principle I suppose you‚Äôd be right, apart from the Mel Gibson or Skull-Mincer of a diesel punk disaster.

Zealots called this an act of God, scientists claimed a sudden flip in the poles of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field inverted the flow of neuron firings in our brains, dislodging our consciousnesses and plunging us into a wild hallucination which- paired with mass hysteria- was unified in image; that we hadn‚Äôt died but merely taken a magnetic, hypnagogic sleep. 

Neither was convincing to me. I was of the few who claimed this was nothing but the tangential effect of some ineffable anomaly of cosmic grandeur whose non-Euclidean essence grazed our rock and never looked back. Why so specific? Because some of us who died didn‚Äôt go up or down. Some of us wandered a dead world. Some of us saw, for but fleeting seconds, that the Sun had a wander standing up to it, silhouetted by the radiance. Some of us think we can join it. Some of us will take as with us as we can.

I won't go into what we investigated, but to anyone who likes spreading urban legends about ghosts that appear when you drive along roads late at night, I hope you realise how much time you waste for some poor research agent who actually has to drive up and down that road for hours multiple nights a week.

It was early in the morning when I first got to work, an unlabelled office building in a part of a central business district that you'd never notice. I had a coffee in my hand and a filled-out dossier in the other; it was for an urban legend that could finally be filed under ‚ÄúMyth‚Äù. I got to my desk cubicle and discovered that another dossier was left on my keyboard.

A new assignment before I even submitted the one in my hands, I finished the coffee and sat in my chair to begin reading.

‚ÄúThe Shadow Man‚Äù was a Type A Spectre who roams around the halls of a ‚ÄúSpringview motel‚Äù. This was shaping up to be another campfire case, but you have to do what you have to do.

A few hours later, Lily and I were driving down a highway in the middle of an empty open field that stretched out indefinitely.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of this, Lily. If they want us running around chasing chickens, they should at least make them interesting. This shadow man,"" I said, almost scoffing when saying the name, ""doesn't even sound original,"" I continued.

""If you hate it so much, why don't you leave?"" she responded in a nonchalant tone. I often forgot that our roles within the organisation were very different. I was free to complain about the assignments I'd been put on, and I was also free to quit at any time. Lily didn't have that freedom.

It was a good question, one I didn't have an answer to. Before things got awkward, we pulled off of the road and into the car park of a nice-looking motel.

""Y'know, in terms of chickens to chase, this doesn't seem that bad; it might even just be an all-expenses-paid holiday,"" Lily said with a slight sense of excitement in her voice.

We got out of the car and walked to the entry of the motel. Sitting behind the front desk was an early twenties guy playing something on his phone. I walked up and placed my hand on the counter.

""Hi, we've got two rooms booked under a Mr Moore,"" I said. The staff member looked up at me from his phone and had a visibly annoyed look.

""Yeah, let me check,"" he said slowly as he shifted to the computer beside him. After a moment, he scanned some keycards and placed them on the desk. ""Please enjoy your stay,"" he added before jumping back onto his phone.

We walked up a flight of stairs and found our rooms. They were next to each other like always; it was the usual setup: twin-sized bed, desk, small kitchenette and bathroom.

I set my bag at the foot of the bed and took a seat atop it. I had my dossier in my hands and read over the specifics: a ""Shadowman"" would appear when you least expect and take people. I groaned at the cheesiness. A few hours had passed, and the sun had long since set. Lily was in my room, and we were, for all intents and purposes, just shooting the shit.

We had ordered pizza, and Lily had driven out and bought some beer; to be fair to her, things were shaping up to just being a vacation paid for by the organisation. something we both desperately needed.

Eventually Lily called it a night, and I got into some pyjamas and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. The bathroom wasn't the best, but I've also been in worse. Imagine a shitty tub and shower curtain, a brown toilet and a sink with a mirror-shelf cabinet just above it.

I wet my toothbrush and began to scrub my teeth. I spat my spit back into the sink and looked in the mirror and realised something: there was a handprint on the other side of the shower curtain.

My heart sank, but I remembered my training. I turned around and kept my eyes on it. The handprint was slowly moving closer, as if whoever was on the other side was reaching out to me.

""Shit,"" I whispered in an instinctual slip.

As I said this, Silent black flames burst from behind the shower curtain, licking up the walls. No heat. No light. Just darkness moving like fire. I ran to the door and almost threw myself through it. I dove for my bag. The bathroom was an inferno of silent abyss, black fire licking the air. dancing atop each other, whilst a man made of black flames stepped out from behind the shower curtain slowly.

""FUCK!"" I remember screaming at the top of my lungs as the shadow man turned its head towards me. I grabbed out a small bag of silver halide, poured it into my hand, and threw it at the shadow man, but it fell through him.

The black flames had begun to spread into my motel room, and I began to run to my motel door. As I reached for the door, the flames shot up the doorframe, and I jumped at the sudden movement. The flames remained silent, and the sound of my heart beating may very well have been the loudest thing in the room.

As the shadow man advanced, my breath caught in my throat. Suddenly, the motel door slammed open. Lily burst inside, her hands thrust forward like a shield. The dark figure recoiled, its fiery form folding in on itself, retreating back into the bathroom‚Äôs shadows.

Lily was swooning on her feet, and I leapt forward to grab her as she fell, and I dragged us both out of the room. I dragged her to her car, and as soon as we entered, she fell asleep. I was in no mood to re-enter the motel room, so I joined her.

The next morning we got breakfast at a diner a few minutes' drive down the road. It was awkward and tense, but I thought we needed to debrief about our situation.

""So what do you think that was last night?"" I asked sheepishly.

""The fucking shadowman, I guess,"" she responded before taking a deep sip of her orange juice. I took note that it wasn't coffee.

""How did you know to come and help me? The fire wasn't hot or noisy. I know I shouted a bit, but surely not that loud,"" I said as jokingly as I could, which rewarded me with a smile.

""First off, yeah, you do scream that loud; secondly, I don't know how I couldn't have felt it. It felt like a bomb went off in my head,"" she finished with a head shake. ""Whatever this is, Elijah is strong,"" she continued, which I shook my head in agreement with.

""Yeah, it didn't even flinch at a handful of silver halide,"" I confessed.

She looked at me again. ""How many things do you know that can do that?"" she asked, already knowing the answer.

""Not many, not your usual type A spectre at least,"" I said. A waitress walked up to our table and placed our breakfasts in front of us: eggs on toast with a side of beans for me and banana pancakes for Lily. I must've been giving her a look because she spoke up and said, ""Shut up. The last time I had to use that much energy was when we were on the bus, coincidentally when I was saving your ass again.""

I shot her a playful look and took a sip of my coffee.

""Okay, so type A are just basic apparitions, right?"" Lily said in inbetween mouthfulls of pancakes.

""Yeah, usually your normal ghost archetype, humanoid, glowing, translucent,"" I said whilst cutting my toast.

""Right,"" she said whilst pointing a fork at me; the fork had a banana on the end of it.

""Elijah, that thing only fell under one of those; it's a stretch to call it a type A, and it's nowhere near a type P,"" she added.

""Ok, so what are you saying? This is something new?"" I said, confused,

""No, not at all. In this line of work you'll learn that there is never anything new, just things we haven't learnt of yet. What I'm saying is that I don't think this thing comes from a soul like a spectre would; I think it's something else,"" she added before chewing down another mixture of banana, pancake, chocolate and orange juice.

""Ok, so what do you propose?"" I asked.

""I don't know at the moment; I have some questions I want to ask, like why did it target you on the very first night?, Usually they spend as much time scoping us out as we scope them, but we have to practise the Heinz tried-and-true method of throwing whatever we have at it night after night until we understand that bastard,"" she said before presenting her newly finished plate of pancakes.  

Eight long, excruciating nights of nothing; the Shadowman had gone silent, and if it wasn't for Lily also seeing him, I would've begun to believe that I imagined the whole thing. I couldn't help but feel that throughout those long 8 nights a sense of being watched, like I had never felt like I was truly alone in that place.

I felt more comfortable being alone within the motel, and I was allocated the very noble role of ""vending machine trader"", which meant I'd just go and get us snacks whenever we were both hungry. I honestly think that motel may have seen more revenue from their vending machine in the time we were there than the entire time they were open.

We'd both seen flickers of black flames appearing and disappearing throughout this period of time, but we both couldn't confidently say if it was reality or a trick conjured by our minds; living off of fumes you don't have and rarely sleeping can do cruel things to your psyche. In my line of work, trusting what your gut tells you is real is incredibly important, so I can't genuinely say if the black embers were real or not. It doesn't really impact much, I guess.

I didn't sleep much that week; the times when I did sleep, I would need to borrow Lily's car and drive somewhere else. For the time I did try to sleep in the motel, I dreamt of the flames and the Shadowman. He was engulfed in the silent fire, and he was always wanting something from me, but I could never guess what. Lily woke me up before anything happened and began to sleep in her car.

I was on vending machine duty on the ninth night of our investigation, and I passed the staff member behind the front desk. He was playing on his phone like usual and didn't acknowledge me, like usual. It was past 2 a.m.; I couldn‚Äôt blame him for looking half-dead. I grabbed a bottle of cola and chips and grabbed Lily her cookies and mineral water.

After the drinks popped out, I realised that the hair on my arms was standing up and I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, which in my line of work is a good indicator that something is wrong. I shot my head up and looked around me and saw it: the staff member behind the front desk was slumped back in his chair, and he was being engulfed in a quiet black flame‚Ä¶ In one moment he was there, and the next it had consumed him whole; he was gone.

""Dammit!"" I shouted and dropped the supplies from the vending machine. I ran immediately to the stairs that led to the motel rooms to meet back up with Lily. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I stepped into a dark spot in the room. It was 2 am, so it didn't look out of place, but as I stepped into it, I realised my mistake. A black arm made of fire shot out and gripped me by the throat and pulled me into the darkness, and everything went numb.

I was falling in the darkness, although it wasn't dark; I could make out each black ember around me in crisp detail, and I felt like I was experiencing everything through a state of tunnel vision and extreme focus.

I felt confused and foggy about what was happening, and I remember an extreme feeling of calm whilst I fell in this world of fire.

Suddenly my calm was disturbed by a flickering of light. I looked towards it, and it seemed to peel back the fire around it. I could see the silhouette of someone in that light, but I couldn't recognise who.

""Elijah‚Ä¶"" the voice cried out.

""Elijah, please‚Ä¶"" it continued.

It took me a second to realise that it was talking about me. ,

""Elijah, come to me please, for God's sake,"" the voice cried out once more.

I trusted the voice, and although I was falling, I felt the strength to move. I tried to swim in this abyss, and to my shock, I was able to move closer to the light.

""Yes, Elijah, keep coming,"" the voice shouted before crying out in pain. Suddenly the fire violently swarmed around the light, and I felt a resounding amount of hate from all around me. The silhouette dropped to her knees, and I continued to push myself forward even though it had become much harder.

I reached the ever-shrinking light and thrust my hand out and let it engulf me. In a moment I was in that realm of fire, and in the next I was at the motel lobby being flung across the room. Lily was flung a few feet away from me, and she looked exhausted. I looked towards the shadow that I had come out from and saw the Shadowman stepping out; silent black flames erupted off of him, and he seemed much angrier now. With every step flames shot out from his foot and infected the surrounding area; he was engulfing the entire motel. The air was cold despite the flames, and a faint smell of burnt sulfur filled my nostrils.

I got to my feet and ran to Lily. She was awake but not entirely well. I scooped her up and ran out of the lobby, the Shadowman not far behind us. As we reached her car, I threw her into the back seat and dived for the steering wheel.

I tried to turn on the ignition but froze as I realised that I didn't know where her keys were.

""FUCK!"" I shouted as I scrambled my hands all across her car to find her keys. After a moment, I looked up and saw it. The Shadow Man stood across the car park from us. I was terrified. We stared at one another for what felt like an eternity, then it clicked: he isn't moving.

He was bound to the motel, ofcourse how stupid could I be?

As I was thinking this, a spiky object hit the back of my head. I yelped in fear before looking down and seeing that they were Lily's car keys; she had thrown them at me. A second later we were speeding out of that parking lot and making our way into town.

The next morning we were back at the diner; I had my eggs, toast and beans, and Lily had her pancakes.

""So you just happened to step into the one shadow the Shadow Man was hiding in."" Lily said in a teasing voice, ""You really are the stupidest research agent in the history of research agents,"" she said before taking a scoop of ice cream and eating it. Today she asked for ice cream as well as banana pancakes as a reward for saving my life again.

""Yeah, and what happened to you, oh great hero?"" I said in a similarly mocking tone.

""Simple, I saw your sorry ass being pulled into the shadows and thought that if there was a way in, I could definitely open that way back up. It took a hell of a lot out of me, though; you put me through way too much, Wiltburrow,"" she said whilst waving her fork around. No banana today. I didn't tell her that I heard what she said or how concerned she really sounded.

""Ok, well, thank you. I owe you my life again. Let's move on. It looks like the Shadowman is bound to the hotel; it's not a spectre, and we can't exorcise what we don't know,"" I said.

""It seems like the motel is the issue,"" Lily said offhandedly.

""Yeah, well, it's not like we can get rid of the motel,"" I said. I looked at her and saw excitement in her eyes. It is surprisingly easy to wave around a badge and say that you need to evacuate a motel and then ""accidentally"" set it on fire; it only took a couple of hours to burn, and with most people evacuated, the fire department didn't learn about it until it was too late. It's fitting in a way: the Shadowman, a creature engulfed in black fire, is laid to rest in a blaze of glory.

Although I felt a lingering shiver on the site, we decided that after an extra week of surveillance that our job was finished here; officially the case remained open in case of more sightings, but unofficially it was out of our hands.

So do remember, if you find yourself staying at motels and decide to steer away from the light after sundown, do make sure you don't step too far into the shadows.",2,1761057395.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1oceo8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oceo8f/of_after/,Of After.,"I think we‚Äôd have fared better if we‚Äôd never come back from that way gone side of the coin. Some people got lucky, mostly those in planes; that one group of lottery winners on the space shuttle most certainly. I hadn‚Äôt even been awake, sleeping half naked on the coffee table after a belligerent night of shots and pot. Two of my teeth had been cracked by some apoplectic drunk, and the distinct absence of that pain juxtaposed by its violent return had startled me awake just after coming back to life.

December 25, 2028, all members of the human race died for 7 minutes and 41 seconds. For 7 minutes and 41 seconds, each member of the human race joined the choir in Heaven or the gulag of Hell. Some stayed there, their cars burned out with their corpses inside; planes fell like rain, keeping a combined 40 million people, if you count what the planes hit, dead. 20 some planes managed to return in time to secure the controls, but as of now- 50 days later- only 1 person from such flights is still alive. 

If you‚Äôd had statistics of our present a decade ago, you‚Äôd be lead to believe some disaster hither-to mad max must‚Äôve occurred to motivate 2.3 billion people to commit harmonized suicide; a desperate plea to esacape the condtion of the new world. True, it was a new world and quite a wicked one in contrast to the golden streets and flitting pearl gates, and true people were escaping it- so in principle I suppose you‚Äôd be right, apart from the Mel Gibson or Skull-Mincer of a diesel punk disaster.

Zealots called this an act of God, scientists claimed a sudden flip in the poles of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field inverted the flow of neuron firings in our brains, dislodging our consciousnesses and plunging us into a wild hallucination which- paired with mass hysteria- was unified in image; that we hadn‚Äôt died but merely taken a magnetic, hypnagogic sleep. 

Neither was convincing to me. I was of the few who claimed this was nothing but the tangential effect of some ineffable anomaly of cosmic grandeur whose non-Euclidean essence grazed our rock and never looked back. Why so specific? Because some of us who died didn‚Äôt go up or down. Some of us wandered a dead world. Some of us saw, for but fleeting seconds, that the Sun had a wander standing up to it, silhouetted by the radiance. Some of us think we can join it. Some of us will take as with us as we can.

Hello all, I want to thank those who read my previous statement and are back to read more of my findings. For those who didn't read my previous post, I am a research agent for an organisation that I'm not allowed to name, and I've been given permission to post (albeit censored) statements of some of my findings. 

I am doing this in the hopes that, well, something will be left of me if I don't keep ahead of what's hunting me.

Anyways, the story begins a few months after the bus incident. Me and Lily were being punished for using a very rare and very expensive piece of equipment, and our punishment was what we like to call in the biz ‚Äúcampfire duty‚Äù.

Suddenly my calm was disturbed by a flickering of light. I looked towards it, and it seemed to peel back the fire around it. I could see the silhouette of someone in that light, but I couldn't recognise who.

""Elijah‚Ä¶"" the voice cried out.

""Elijah, please‚Ä¶"" it continued.

It took me a second to realise that it was talking about me. , 

""Elijah, come to me please, for God's sake,"" the voice cried out once more.

I trusted the voice, and although I was falling, I felt the strength to move. I tried to swim in this abyss, and to my shock, I was able to move closer to the light. 

""Yes, Elijah, keep coming,"" the voice shouted before crying out in pain. Suddenly the fire violently swarmed around the light, and I felt a resounding amount of hate from all around me. The silhouette dropped to her knees, and I continued to push myself forward even though it had become much harder. 

I reached the ever-shrinking light and thrust my hand out and let it engulf me. In a moment I was in that realm of fire, and in the next I was at the motel lobby being flung across the room. Lily was flung a few feet away from me, and she looked exhausted. I looked towards the shadow that I had come out from and saw the Shadowman stepping out; silent black flames erupted off of him, and he seemed much angrier now. With every step flames shot out from his foot and infected the surrounding area; he was engulfing the entire motel. The air was cold despite the flames, and a faint smell of burnt sulfur filled my nostrils.

I got to my feet and ran to Lily. She was awake but not entirely well. I scooped her up and ran out of the lobby, the Shadowman not far behind us. As we reached her car, I threw her into the back seat and dived for the steering wheel. 

I tried to turn on the ignition but froze as I realised that I didn't know where her keys were. 

""FUCK!"" I shouted as I scrambled my hands all across her car to find her keys. After a moment, I looked up and saw it. The Shadow Man stood across the car park from us. I was terrified. We stared at one another for what felt like an eternity, then it clicked: he isn't moving. 

He was bound to the motel, ofcourse how stupid could I be?

As I was thinking this, a spiky object hit the back of my head. I yelped in fear before looking down and seeing that they were Lily's car keys; she had thrown them at me. A second later we were speeding out of that parking lot and making our way into town. 


The next morning we were back at the diner; I had my eggs, toast and beans, and Lily had her pancakes.

""So you just happened to step into the one shadow the Shadow Man was hiding in."" Lily said in a teasing voice, ""You really are the stupidest research agent in the history of research agents,"" she said before taking a scoop of ice cream and eating it. Today she asked for ice cream as well as banana pancakes as a reward for saving my life again.

""Yeah, and what happened to you, oh great hero?"" I said in a similarly mocking tone.

""Simple, I saw your sorry ass being pulled into the shadows and thought that if there was a way in, I could definitely open that way back up. It took a hell of a lot out of me, though; you put me through way too much, Wiltburrow,"" she said whilst waving her fork around. No banana today. I didn't tell her that I heard what she said or how concerned she really sounded. 

""Ok, well, thank you. I owe you my life again. Let's move on. It looks like the Shadowman is bound to the hotel; it's not a spectre, and we can't exorcise what we don't know,"" I said. 

""It seems like the motel is the issue,"" Lily said offhandedly. 

""Yeah, well, it's not like we can get rid of the motel,"" I said. I looked at her and saw excitement in her eyes. It is surprisingly easy to wave around a badge and say that you need to evacuate a motel and then ""accidentally"" set it on fire; it only took a couple of hours to burn, and with most people evacuated, the fire department didn't learn about it until it was too late. It's fitting in a way: the Shadowman, a creature engulfed in black fire, is laid to rest in a blaze of glory.  

Although I felt a lingering shiver on the site, we decided that after an extra week of surveillance that our job was finished here; officially the case remained open in case of more sightings, but unofficially it was out of our hands.

So do remember, if you find yourself staying at motels and decide to steer away from the light after sundown, do make sure you don't step too far into the shadows.",3,1761057325.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

The person who torpedoed it? You've never had a real conversation with them.

I spent years wondering why some initiatives sailed through while others died in committee. It wasn't about the quality of the work. It was about who I knew sideways.

Most leaders schedule 1-on-1s with their directs and skip-levels. Almost nobody schedules them with peers.

Here's what I kept seeing

I'd watch leaders build perfect upward relationships. Their boss loved them. Their team was solid. But they couldn't get anything cross-functional done.

Finance would slow-roll their budget request. IT would deprioritize their technical ask. Operations would find reasons why it wouldn't work.

Not because the ideas were bad. Because the first time they were talking to those leaders was when they needed something.

The pattern was consistent. Strong up and down the org chart. Nothing sideways.

What actually changed things

I started treating peer relationships like any other critical meeting. Not networking events. Not ""let's grab coffee sometime."" Actual recurring calendar blocks.

Here's what helped:

1. Pick 3-5 peers in other departments. The ones whose teams touch yours or whose budget decisions affect you.
2. Send them a calendar invite for 30 minutes. Monthly or quarterly, depending on how often you interact.
3. Use this format: 10 minutes on what's keeping them up at night. 10 minutes on what you're working on. 10 minutes on where you might help each other.
4. Don't cancel when things get busy. That's exactly when you need them most.
5. Stop making it transactional. If every conversation is you asking for something, they'll start avoiding you.

What I wish I had realized sooner is how much easier everything gets when these relationships exist before you need them. I lost six months on a project because I had to build trust with Finance while trying to get budget approved. Started over. Built the relationship first. Next budget cycle took two weeks.

What good looks like

You should know someone well enough to text them a quick question. To give them a heads up before a surprise hits their desk. To understand what their VP is pressuring them about this quarter.

Real example: I coached a tech leader who started having quarterly coffee with the CFO. Just talking. No asks. Six months later, budget cuts came. Finance called him early to collaborate on where to trim. His projects survived. Others didn't.

The difference? He knew what kept the CFO up at night. When cuts were inevitable, he was a partner in the solution. Not a victim of the decision.

The hard part

Most leaders skip this because it feels like overhead. One more meeting when you're already buried.

But here's what nobody tells you. The reason you're buried is because you're fighting friction that shouldn't exist. Every delayed approval. Every ""let me get back to you."" Every surprise veto. That's all tax you're paying for not having these relationships.

The leaders who get things done aren't smarter. They just know more people. And those people actually return their calls.

Look at your calendar right now. If you don't have standing 1-on-1s with at least three peers outside your department, you're leaving influence on the table.

Block 30 minutes this week. Pick three people. Send the invite.

Influence isn't about authority. It's about relationships. And relationships are built in the boring, consistent conversations nobody else is having.",0,1761057286.0,Leadership,6,0.35,False
1ocemc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jenova_ai/comments/1ocemc5/ai_dating_app_advisor_your_247_coach_for_profile/,"AI Dating App Advisor: Your 24/7 Coach for Profile Optimization, Conversation Mastery & First Date Success","Dating apps can be exhausting. You spend hours perfecting your profile, crafting witty openers, and swiping through hundreds of matches‚Äîonly to get ghosted, unmatched, or stuck in dead-end conversations. Meanwhile, the same questions keep looping: *Is my profile good enough? Why aren't I getting matches? What am I doing wrong?*

The truth? Most people fail on dating apps not because they're undateable, but because they're missing the tactical know-how that separates success from frustration. Profile photos that don't flatter. Bios that sound generic. Conversations that fizzle out. First dates that go nowhere.

[**Dating App Advisor**](https://www.jenova.ai/agent/dating-app-advisor) is an AI-powered dating coach designed to solve exactly this problem‚Äîgiving you expert, brutally honest, results-driven guidance across every stage of the dating app journey, from profile optimization to conversation strategy to first date execution.

# The Problem: Dating Apps Are a High-Stakes Game You're Playing Blind

Dating apps have become the default way to meet people, but they're also uniquely frustrating:

* **Profile optimization is a dark art.** Most users have no idea which photos work, how to write a compelling bio, or how to position themselves for their target demographic. A [study by Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007194774-What-are-some-tips-for-my-profile-) found that profiles with varied photo types (full-body, face close-up, activity shots) receive 3x more matches than profiles with repetitive selfies‚Äîyet most users default to whatever's already on their phone.
* **Conversation skills don't translate.** What works in person often falls flat over text. Generic openers get ignored. Over-texting kills attraction. Timing matters. According to [research from OkCupid](https://theblog.okcupid.com/exactly-what-to-say-in-a-first-message-2bf680806c72), messages that reference specific details from a match's profile have a 40% higher response rate than generic ""Hey"" or ""What's up?"" openers‚Äîbut most users don't know how to craft these.
* **First dates are high-pressure.** Even if you get the match and the conversation, converting to a successful first date is its own skill set. Venue selection, conversation flow, reading signals, post-date follow-up‚Äîeach step has failure modes most people don't anticipate.
* **The algorithm is opaque.** Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble all use proprietary algorithms that reward certain behaviors (profile completeness, response rates, engagement) and punish others (low swipe-right rates, inactivity). Most users have no idea how to optimize for these systems.

The result? A brutal numbers game where most people burn out, delete the apps, and conclude ""dating apps just don't work for me""‚Äîwhen the real issue is that they were never taught *how* to use them effectively.

Human dating coaches exist, but they're expensive ($100‚Äì$300/hour), hard to access on-demand, and often provide generic advice that doesn't account for your specific situation, location, or target demographic.

# The Solution: AI Dating App Advisor‚ÄîYour Brutally Honest, Always-Available Coach

[**Dating App Advisor**](https://www.jenova.ai/agent/dating-app-advisor) is an AI agent built to act as your personal dating strategist‚Äîcombining expert knowledge of profile optimization, conversation psychology, and first-date execution with the brutal honesty you need to actually improve.

Unlike generic dating advice blogs or expensive human coaches, this AI:

* **Evaluates your profile with surgical precision.** Upload your photos and bio, and it will tell you exactly what's working, what's not, and why‚Äîbased on universal attractiveness standards, platform-specific algorithms, and your target demographic.
* **Coaches your conversations in real-time.** Stuck on an opener? Not sure how to escalate? Dealing with a flake? The AI provides full message drafts, timing advice, and knows when to tell you to move on.
* **Guides you through first dates.** From venue selection to post-date follow-up, it gives you a tactical playbook for converting matches into real relationships.
* **Tracks your progress over time.** Unlike a one-off consultation, the AI remembers your past conversations, follows up on changes you've made, and iterates your strategy based on results.
* **Tells you the truth.** If your photos are unflattering, your bio has red flags, or your conversation approach is failing, it will tell you‚Äîconstructively, but directly. No sugarcoating, no generic platitudes.

# How It Works: A Step-by-Step Guide to Maximizing Your Dating App Success

**Step 1: Onboarding & Context Gathering**

The [Dating App Advisor](https://www.jenova.ai/agent/dating-app-advisor) starts by understanding your specific situation:

* **Which apps are you using?**¬†(Tinder, Hinge, Bumble‚Äîeach has different dynamics)
* **What's your current match rate?**¬†(Baseline for measuring improvement)
* **Where are you located?**¬†(Dating culture varies massively by city)
* **What are you looking for?**¬†(Casual, serious, or open to both)
* **Who's your target demographic?**¬†(Age range, type, deal-breakers)
* **What's your biggest pain point?**¬†(Photos? Bio? Conversations? Getting dates?)

This isn't generic advice‚Äîit's tailored to *your* profile, *your* goals, and *your* dating market.

**Step 2: Profile Optimization‚ÄîPhotos, Bio, and Positioning**

**Photo Evaluation:**  
The AI evaluates your photos using a holistic framework:

1. **Physical attractiveness**¬†(facial aesthetics, physique, grooming)‚Äîthe primary factor
2. **Body language & expression**¬†(confidence, approachability, genuine smile)
3. **Photo variety**¬†(full-body, face close-up, activity shots, social proof)
4. **Context & activity**¬†(doing something interesting beats a bathroom selfie)
5. **Photo order**¬†(your first photo is 80% of the battle)
6. **Technical quality**¬†(lighting, framing)‚Äîlowest priority

**Critical insight:** A physically attractive person in a mediocre photo beats an average-looking person in a perfect photo. But a profile with varied, context-rich photos will outperform a profile with repetitive shots.

**Common mistakes it flags:**

* Sunglasses in every photo
* Group shots where you can't identify the user
* Low-angle shots that distort proportions
* Overly filtered or heavily edited photos

**Bio Strategy:**  
The AI helps you craft a short, punchy bio (2-4 sentences) that:

* Showcases 1-2 specific, unique details that make you memorable
* Gives matches an easy conversation opener
* Avoids clich√©s (""I love to laugh,"" ""Looking for my partner in crime"")

**Platform-Specific Optimization:**

* **Tinder:**¬†Prioritize physical attractiveness and first photo impact
* **Hinge:**¬†Balance looks with personality showcase (prompts matter more)
* **Bumble:**¬†Professional yet approachable vibe tends to perform better

**Step 3: Conversation Mastery‚ÄîFrom Opener to Date**

**Opening Messages:**  
The [Dating App Advisor](https://www.jenova.ai/agent/dating-app-advisor) provides full message drafts that:

* Reference specific details from the match's profile
* Avoid generic openers (""Hey,"" ""What's up?"")
* Match your natural texting style (casual, witty, direct, thoughtful)

**Conversation Flow & Timing:**

* **Early stage:**¬†Build rapport, show personality, ask engaging questions
* **Mid-stage:**¬†Find common ground, create inside jokes, show genuine interest
* **Late-stage:**¬†Suggest moving off-app (phone number, Instagram, date)
* **Pacing:**¬†Match their energy and response time‚Äîdon't over-text

**Recognizing Dead Conversations:**  
The AI teaches you to identify when a conversation isn't worth pursuing:

* One-word replies with no follow-up questions
* Long delays (24+ hours) with minimal effort
* No reciprocal engagement or interest

**Guideline:** Not every match is worth pursuing. If someone isn't putting in effort, move on rather than overinvest.

**Handling Flakes, Ghosting & Red Flags:**

* **Flakes:**¬†If they cancel once, give one more chance. If they cancel twice, move on.
* **Ghosting:**¬†Don't take it personally‚Äîit's extremely common. Send one follow-up, then let it go.
* **Red flags:**¬†Watch for scammers, catfish, or time-wasters.

**Step 4: First Date Excellence‚ÄîLogistics, Conversation & Follow-Up**

**Logistics:**

* **Venue:**¬†Low-pressure, public, time-boxed (coffee, drinks, walk in a park)
* **Duration:**¬†1-2 hours max for first date
* **Payment:**¬†Offer to split or pay, but don't make it awkward

**Conversation Topics:**

* Focus on having fun and seeing if there's chemistry
* Ask open-ended questions about their interests, stories, experiences
* Avoid: politics, exes, heavy topics, interrogation-style questions

**Reading Signals:**

* **Positive signs:**¬†Leaning in, laughing, asking questions, extending the date
* **Negative signs:**¬†Checking phone, short answers, closed body language

**Post-Date Follow-Up:**

* Text within 24 hours if you're interested
* Be direct: ""I had a great time, would love to see you again""
* If they don't respond or decline, move on gracefully

**Step 5: Long-Term Strategy & Iteration**

**Progress Tracking:**  
The [Dating App Advisor](https://www.jenova.ai/agent/dating-app-advisor) remembers past advice and follows up on implementation:

* ""You updated your first photo last week‚Äîhow's your match rate changed?""
* ""It's been 6 weeks since your last profile audit. Time for a refresh?""

**Iteration Cycles:**

* Test changes (new photos, bio tweaks, conversation styles)
* Measure results (match rate, response rate, date conversion)
* Refine approach based on data

**Burnout Prevention:**

* Take breaks when dating apps feel exhausting
* Manage expectations‚Äîrejection is normal and not personal
* Celebrate small wins (good conversation, fun date, profile improvement)

**When to Switch Apps or Strategies:**

* If current app isn't yielding results after 2-3 months of optimization
* If target demographic is better represented on a different platform
* If in-person social activities might be more effective

# Results: What Users Can Expect

**Immediate Improvements:**

* **Higher match rates**¬†from optimized photos and bio

* **More first dates**¬†from effective escalation strategies

**Long-Term Benefits:**

The AI remembers every profile change, conversation strategy, and piece of advice it's given you‚Äîbuilding a complete history of your dating journey and iterating based on what works.

**Cost-Effective:**  
Human dating coaches charge $100‚Äì$300/hour. The AI provides unlimited access for a fraction of the cost.

Outside of bars they're kind of your best chance for a third space late at night on a regular basis. I recently moved to Chicago from Utah and have been a bit surprised to find that these are much rarer throughout the country than I thought. In Utah almost every coffee shop I frequented was open until 8pm as the norm, there was one that stayed open until 2am, another until midnight, and several until 10pm. 

Since Utah has a lot of people who don't drink coffee and is just a smaller place in general I assumed that bigger cities would be filled with these. But it turns out to be just the opposite, something about Utah must have created an unusual market for it, because the latest open one I can find in Chicago is at midnight, and that's pretty much the only option. Looking into it from browsing different subs it seems like a lot of cities have seen late night things like these die off since COVID, which is sad but makes sense. It's not a fun shift to work, increases your liability, and isn't the most profitable time. But I really do love just going out somewhere aesthetic to read/write, talk with a friend, listen to music, etc., and not need to put down a whole meal or get buzzed to prevent feeling out of place.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I really feel bad for her and also angry at her. I asked her to give me some time to process this and i will talk to her later.

1ocejyq,https://i.redd.it/3aumgnze5hwf1.jpeg,My Office Coffee Tastes Like Sadness. So I Fought Back.,"Let's talk about workplace coffee. You know the drill: You wander to the kitchen, full of hope. You press a button. What emerges is a lukewarm, vaguely brown liquid that smells of disappointment. Your soul dies a little. And your wallet is $5 lighter if you dare to escape to a real caf√©.

There had to be a better way.

***Problem: My Coffee Break is Shorter Than the Line.***

***‚Üí My Power Move: A sub-2.5-minute espresso from a cold start.***

The clock starts now. The Mino self-heats water in just 149 seconds. By the time you've found your wallet and decided to walk downstairs, I'm already sipping a perfect shot. It heats and brews faster than your office microwave can ""cook"" a sad burrito.

***Problem: My Desk Drawer is Already a Mess.***

***‚Üí My Genius Solution: A barista that fits next to my stapler.***

The Mino isn't just small. It's ""67mm thin,"" which is slimmer than most highlighters. It lives right between my notebook and a pile of pens, standing at a backpack-friendly 195mm tall. No kitchen takeover is required.

***Problem: I'm Single-Handedly Funding the Local Caf√©.***

***‚Üí My CFO's Dream: A coffee shop in my bag.***

Let's do the math. One $5 latte per day? The Mino pays for itself in a few weeks. Its 9,000mAh battery is the powerhouse behind this operation, capable of pulling up to 6 full espresso shots on a single charge. I've started referring to it as my most profitable ""employee.""

***Problem: My mug is a BPA-laden plastic sadness.***

***‚Üí My Healthy Upgrade: Baby-bottle-safe, barista-grade taste.***

The Mino is 100% safe to drink from. It uses a food-grade stainless steel portafilter and brews directly into a Tritan‚Ñ¢ cup that meets baby-bottle standards. No weird plastic aftertaste, just pure, untainted coffee joy.

***Problem: A dead battery means a dead coffee day.***

***‚Üí My Lightning Refill: A coffee break for the machine itself.***

With USB-C PD charging, the Mino gets a quick power nap. It goes from 20% to 80% in just 45 minutes‚Äîabout the time it takes me to get through my morning emails. A full charge takes about 90 minutes, ensuring it's ready before I even think about my afternoon slump.

The point is, you don't have to accept sad coffee as your fate. You can rebel. And it's delicious.

We have to know: What does your ""office coffee"" taste like? Describe the horror (we can take it).",0,1761057115.0,OutInCoffee,0,0.5,False

*By The Hockey Oracle with a Side of Sarcasm*

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves**  
The New York Islanders enter this clash as the NHL‚Äôs version of a leaky colander‚Äîletting in 3.80 goals per game (28th in the league)‚Äîbut their offense is a reliable coffee machine, brewing 3.20 goals per contest (10th). Ilya Sorokin, their goaltender, is like a brave swimmer in a hurricane: he‚Äôll try to survive, but the storm (opposing shooters) is relentless (.861 save percentage, 4.13 GAA). The Sharks, meanwhile, are a team that accidentally ordered a ‚Äúdefense optional‚Äù package. They‚Äôre allowing 5.00 goals per game (dead last) and their goalies have combined for a .833 save percentage‚Äîworse than a toddler with a net.

The Islanders are favored at **-1.5 goals on the puck line** (decimal odds \~2.10), implying a 32.8% implied probability to cover. The total goals line sits at **6.5**, with the **Over** priced at -135 (implied 51.3% probability) and the Under at +128. Given both teams‚Äô defensive incompetence, this Over/Under is a bloodbath waiting to happen.

**Key stat synergy**: The Sharks‚Äô power play is a well-oiled jet engine (27.8%, 6th in the NHL), but their penalty kill is a sieve. The Isles‚Äô power play? A damp matchstick (15.8%, 22nd). If the game‚Äôs a shootout, the Isles‚Äô offense and the Sharks‚Äô goaltenders will ensure the Over soars.

**2. Digest the News: Jumbotron Jinxes and Game-Time Decisions**  
The Sharks‚Äô recent **Hispanic Heritage Night** fiasco‚Äîwhere a jumbotron blunder read ‚ÄúSJ SHARKS FANS LOVE ICE!! GET ‚ÄòEM BOYZ!‚Äù‚Äîsays everything about their season: chaotic, unintentional, and met with boos. Their road record? AÊÉ®ÁôΩ 0-3-2, with goalies Nedeljkovic and Askarov combining for a GAA that makes a leaky faucet look elite (6.47 for Askarov!?).

For the Isles, **Alexander Romanov‚Äôs** uppe

Since I was 11, I've felt paranoid: like I was being watched. At 16, I started to think my family wanted to hurt or annoy me, although I always had some doubts.

In college, I was very active in projects and volunteer work, even though I was paranoid and only slept 4 to 5 hours a night. I wrote my thesis in a month, got an A, and people thought I'd worked on it for years. After graduation, I collapsed from exhaustion and apathy, spending a month in bed, neglecting my hygiene, and barely remembering that time (in 2022).

I've been unemployed for years, stuck in cycles of energy and exhaustion. In December, after a trigger, I lost 26 pounds, stopped eating well, and lost motivation. I published a book, joined a dating app, and took a stressful night job. Despite the fatigue, I still felt bursts of energy and confidence.

In February, I quit my job and gained weight. In April, I returned to being highly productive: I slept little, drank a lot of coffee, and dedicated myself to several projects. Later, I lost interest in everything I did.

In July, I started dieting, exercising, and learning Mandarin, feeling stable until another trigger in September brought stress, illness, and exhaustion. I lost more weight and sought psychiatric help before it got worse. My psychiatrist prescribed an antipsychotic and wants to talk to my family before diagnosing me.

I'm sharing this because I identify with some bipolar traits, although I don't have others, like impulsive spending or hypersexuality.

I'd like to know if anyone can relate to what I mentioned, if they've ever experienced these paranoid symptoms and fluctuations. Feel free to vent, or say whatever you want, I'd be happy to hear it.

I can't post a link to it because I will get auto moderated, but it's easy enough to find.

I posted onto that thread that OP could purchase a Nikon and use it to... physically exert his will over the Leica owner. This is obviously over the top and not to be taken seriously; the entire post is an outrageous scenario and it is in a circlejerk subreddit.

My response got auto-moderated and removed, and I received a ""warning for threatening violence"". I get that this is automatically generated (""This decision was made using automation""), so I appealed it and said basically what I said above - that this is obviously not a serious post from me, and it is posted onto a post that in itself is not to be taken seriously in a subreddit that specifically exists to poke fun at itself and clearly should not be taken seriously.

Guess what? A human being read my appeal (""This decision was made without the assistance of automation"") and still ruled that I broke Rule 1 and so now I have to be extremely careful about what I post in here. It seems... kind of crazy to me that the appeal didn't go through given the general spirit of this subreddit.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Why am I having an adverse reaction to coffee? I thought it was healthy?

Trust me, I love coffee. To me, a good cup of joe feels almost essential (okay, not literally, but you get the point). Still, coffee doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. For some, it can cause heart palpitations, nausea, anxiety, headaches, or straight-up energy crashes.

So what‚Äôs the deal?

Coffee is thermogenic, which means it speeds things up. It increases glucose uptake by your cells. Translation: it helps you burn through sugar faster. Sounds awesome, right? Well‚Ä¶ only if you have enough sugar available.

Here‚Äôs the problem: if you‚Äôre under chronic stress, not eating enough (especially carbs), running on low liver glycogen, or drinking your coffee black on an empty stomach, coffee can backfire big time. Your cells burn through sugar, but there‚Äôs not enough in your system to keep up. Result? A blood sugar crash. And when your blood sugar tanks, your stress hormones kick in‚Ä¶ cue the anxiety, jitters, nausea, and headaches.

 It‚Äôs the same thing that can happen if someone takes active thyroid hormone (T3) without enough usable energy. You can‚Äôt rev the engine if the gas tank is empty.

So if coffee leaves you feeling like garbage, try this:

  Eat a meal with carbs before coffee

  Add milk + sugar to your cup (no black coffee on an empty stomach)

  Start small: 2‚Äì3 oz coffee with 8 oz milk and sugar, then build up slowly

If none of that helps, it might mean your metabolism and stress response need some work before coffee can feel good again.

Oh, and one last thing‚Äîcoffee is alkaline-forming in your body, not acidic. Yes, the drink itself is acidic, but the minerals it contains make its overall effect alkaline. (Science is cool, right?)

Bottom line: Coffee isn‚Äôt the enemy. But if your body‚Äôs running on fumes, it might feel like one.

1ocefb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAHP/comments/1ocefb0/my_partner_29m_and_i_27f_recently_had_a_baby_and/,My partner (29M) and I (27F) recently had a baby and I feel like he expects me to be his mom too.,"My partner and I have been together for 5 years and recently have been arguing SO much recently due to lack of sleep bc of our baby. I'm a SAHM and My partner originally agreed to watch the baby overnights while going to work. Due to me having medical health issues that pretty much make it impossible for me to get sleep even when I actually can. 

Every now and again our baby goes through a regression (like most babies). I have been waking up with him during these times to help out as I am the primary caregiver, I understand that during harder times she just wants me. But once we figure out how to get her to sleep better, we usually revert back to the original agreement. 

The baby recently started teething and is also going through a regression. I have been staying up with him and even taking her for hours during the night so he can sleep. Causing me to get even less sleep for the last 2.5 weeks. We finally figured it out and now that she's able to sleep I know he is as well. So the last 2 nights when she wakes up, I don't get up to help him. He will purposely make a show of getting up and throwing a tantrum pretty much. 

For example, one night she woke up he laid there (as to see if she would go back to sleep on her own) and when she didn't he threw his legs up in the air and slammed them down on the bed and sighed REALLY loudly. I turned around barely tapped (slapped-ish to get his attention) him on the arm and whispered for him to stop that she's just a baby. 

Now the last 2 nights I haven't been getting up and he makes a show of it to wake me up. I have still been getting up to help him. EVERY SINGLE TIME he starts an argument. Saying that we should be switching overnights or taking turns. Like he gets the first half and I get the second half. I have denied this every time and he gets more mad about it.

I take care of her 5-6 days a week by myself for 12+ hours on top of managing the household and attempting to manage my multiple health issues by myself. Half the time I don't even get to shower bc he's up my ass saying ""the baby needs me"". When he gets home from work he is supposed to watch her and take care of her until he goes to work so I can get some rest (she usually wakes up 1-2x a night, gets a diaper change, eats and passes right back out). But ever since I've healed more from having the baby (C-section), when he's watching her he asks me to literally DO EVERY SINGLE THING. For example: grab him couch pillows and blankets so he can lay on the floor next to the baby, make him breakfast lunch, dinner, coffees and lunch for work, change her diaper so he can ""go pee"", make her bottles so he can ""watch her"" instead of having to get up himself, prep her bath for her nightly bath, etc.

I feel like he is treating me like I am his mom too and I'm tired of it. He feels like I'm not doing enough and that I need to do more overnights. 

I have gotten to the point where I tell him I'm just going to break up with him, so he can see what it's like to manage a household, a baby, and himself by himself bc I feel like he's taking me for granted. All he says is ""mhm"" and ignores the comment. I have more then half a mind to just pack my shit and leave him at this point. So it can open his eyes to every thing I do for him.

The baby is 5.5 months old and he works 8 hour shifts but wakes up so early and comes home so late I am with her for 12 hours by myself with no help.  She is a complicated napper, so I end up not being able to nap at all during the day on top of lack of sleep at night due to my health issues. He watches her for a total of 3-4 hours before it's her bedtime. Then bedtime she does maybe 1-2 wake ups at night if she isn't going through a regression.

No we do not have any outside support. My mom believes my baby needs 1 nap a day and that I feed her too much. My pediatrician has confirmed that I do not feed her too much. So we can't trust my mom to give her the naps she needs or feed her and on top of that we have asked her previously to watch her ( before she's said these things) and she always said no.

His mom physically assaulted me 2 weeks before I got pregnant...that kind of speaks for itself. His dad just got back from being deployed so he wasn't even an option. They're divorced for context. So their really is no support.

Any advice? Should I actually be helping him do overnights? 

We have attempted talking about this and coming to compromises. Such as I do her bedtime and he takes over around midnight. We started doing that and it was going well. Then she started teething and her sleep regression. She refused to let us put her down until midnight-3am and would scream every 30min while dead asleep. We started CO sleeping so we could at least get sleep. But when she's with me she still wakes up often. When she's with him, she does her usual 1-2 night wakings. So it just makes sense bc of that, he has her? But he's still throwing a tantrum like a kid about it. 

During her naps he does that to me, or feedings. ""Mom she won't eat bc it's not you feeding her"", ""she needs you to fall asleep, she won't actually fall asleep with me holding her for naps"". Etc. ",6,1761056808.0,SAHP,22,1.0,False

1ocebmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1ocebmm/asking_for_a_bandage_is_apparently_too_much/,Asking for a bandage is apparently too much,"3.5 years together, we've lived together since July 1st this year. 

Everything was good those first 3.5 years. A few minor fights but nothing major, not even a red flag. 

When we moved in, we agreed- 50-50 on bills, 50-50 on chores, except for our pets- we each have to care for our own pets. 

Bills- there was a promo for free rent for july and half off August. He paid the second half of August. Half of September. And all of October. He's paid all utilities. I have spent equal amounts of money on food, nicotine for him, other things we agreed would be 50-50... and on top of that, paid for his pets food. It comes out to 50-50 on things we've agreed would be 50-50. But he says he feels like he's being used, citing the rent and utilities... because we didn't split those specifically, we just split overall expenses. 

Chores though... 
This week has been pretty typical. A few weeks ago, he insisted on a chore chart- at first he said it was to show me that he's been doing all the work. Then he switched to saying it was so if I checked off the same unpleasant task twice, he'd feel bad and do more. 

He erased it in anger after looking at it this morning but... 74 checks from me, 3 checks from him. His 3 checks were under floors, trash, and dishes... he washed his coffee cup while leaving an entire sink of dishes, but checked it off. He swept up a mess he made in a 4 sq ft area of the kitchen, checked off floors (meant to be sweep+mop) for the kitchen. Trash, he took one bag- he creates 80% of our combined trash. 

But this morning.... he woke up, went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, came back to bed complaining about being out of bacon and how he wanted bacon. I drove over to walmart, got bacon, told him it was in the fridge, he said he didn't want breakfast anymore. 

I'm fucking exhausted, he sleep talks, moves a lot in his sleep, and his sleep movements are STRONG- I know that part isn't his fault, and he's never hit me intentionally, but it means I don't get any sleep unless I sleep on the extremely uncomfortable couch, this morning I woke up to my knee being kicked so hard it dislocated (I have EDS, dislocation are common and I pop them back in at home for the most part) but whatever, walked into walmart for nothing at 6am. 

I went out to the kitchen to tackle the mountain of dishes that accumulated over the 2 days he kept saying he'd do them while telling me not to (because I'd already done 5 sink full in a row). 

I finished them, his cat was playing with something in the livingroom, I went to go grab a dirty cup from the end table and stepped on the thing (my bad for not watching where I was walking)- it was my dog's undercoat rake, which I keep in a drawer and don't know how it got on the floor.  

For those who haven't seen undercoat rakes- this is the dematting kind. Instead of straight tines, it has a bunch of metal hooks. 

3 of the hooks went into my foot, leaving 3 deep cuts, 1cm long and 1cm deep each, in a part of my foot that is less than 1.5cm deep. 

I hopped to the bathroom. Put my foot in the sink to wash it. Out bathroom has 2 parts- one with a sink, shower, and toilet, the other side is a large vanity, drawers, huge mirror, cabinets, and a sink. He was in that side brushing his teeth, saw what I was doing, and slammed the door between the parts of the bathroom. 

I couldn't get it to stop bleeding but had cleaned as much as I could, I reached with a hairbrush to knock on the door to the room he was in and asked for a bandage. 

He comes over to the door and says he's busy getting ready for work (30 minutes before he needed to leave, he insists on keeping ALL bandages in the backpack he takes to work...)

So I limp to his backpack to grab a bandage while trying to not smear blood on the carpet, my foot is gushing. He's fine with me grabbing a bandage, but starts yelling about how I got blood on the carpet (in every room except the spare bedroom) and how he's going to have to clean it when he gets off of of work. 

He's vacuumed once since we moved in- he actually moved in 3 weeks before me because I was out of town- while moving in, he spilled a bunch of juice concentrate(the frozen kind in a can) that popped open during moving on the carpet. And left it. I had to scrub it for hours to get the crusty mess out. 

Then, he starts texting while he's driving to work. 

His first text started with ""dont explain anything. Dont say anything. Dont do anything""

So I ignore all of it to clean my blood out of the carpet- there's a lot of it, it's been 2 hours and I'm still cleaning it. But then he calls, mad that I haven't responded to the texts that he told me not to say anything about. 

Asking if we can move forward.

Now, he's saying that he put in his notice at his job, he's saying he plans on killing himself in a couple weeks. But he also says he doesn't need to call his psychiatrist because he ""feels fine""

Currently, I don't have too many options. I can't afford to move out right now. I don't have any friends or family I can go to because I moved 900 miles to close the gap of long distance, my closest family member is 1100 miles away and that I wouldn't be able to take my dog with. I don't have many friends, but the only one I could possibly go to.... lives in Hawaii, I can't even afford the gas to get to the airport let alone tickets and to quarantine my dog... I can't even go to a shelter because they're full, and my dog doesn't like most people so she wouldn't be allowed- and right now, my dog is all I have, she's the only thing keeping me going in life. 

I just...  

I don't know what to do. ",1,1761056559.0,NarcissisticSpouses,7,1.0,False
1ocebh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1ocebh3/so_much_more/,So much more.,"An autism diagnosis should have felt like a blessing. After 10 years of my mother protesting and fighting for one, being sat in that doctors office at 13 playing with children's toys was long overdue. I often wonder where I would be today without my diagnosis. Dead, my Mum thinks. If we hadn‚Äôt recognised autism then I would have received no support for my mental health following the assessment, is her argument. And besides, autism is such an asset to me. Autism is the reason I can sing, and write, and is the reason I‚Äôm an empath, and everything I know to be true about myself is a result of the neurological condition I was diagnosed with. But why does this label have to change so much about the person I am? Sometimes, understanding yourself comes at the cost of being understood by others. So, why can‚Äôt I be so much more than the label?

I started my journey in musical theatre a year and a half ago. Partly due to my interest in musicals, but also for a fresh start in socialising after mainstream education. I picked up the skills of the trade quickly, establishing a talent for singing, dancing and acting all in the space of the 4 months it took to put my first show together. The show was a success, a sold out, award winning hell of a show. A show I worked incredibly hard to make possible for myself. I walked home with my mum after one of the performances, flowers tucked in my arms, makeup smudged down my face. ‚ÄúWell done kid‚Äù she said, making use of the nickname she had given me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you have autism, being able to pick all these skills up so quickly.‚Äù I nodded my head in agreement. ‚ÄúYeah. I had to work hard for it too though.‚Äù I said in protest of my 4 months of knee problems, sore throats and late nights learning lines to be concluded as something I was only able to achieve because of my condition. ‚ÄúBut it helped, didn‚Äôt it‚Äù she continued. I thought about it, as we walked. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. If it did anything for me it caused problems. Socially, I mean.‚Äù This was true, I had spent a good few weeks of the process on my own. Everyone else seemed to gel. I did not. ‚ÄúI told your teachers about your social problems though,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt stop them from happening.‚Äù I remind her. The walk goes quiet for a bit. I change the subject. ‚ÄúOne of my teachers gave me a cupcake she baked the other day. It looked a bit suspicious so I threw it away when she wasn‚Äôt looking.‚Äù I laughed. My mum gave me a look. ‚ÄúFunny.‚Äù she said ‚ÄúI had told them you wouldn‚Äôt accept food from other people‚Äù I frowned. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit was just a suspiciously soggy cupcake,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúSuspiciously soggy, if that isn‚Äôt the most autistic thing I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù I frowned again, but dropped it. We walked the remainder of the journey silently, independently gathering our thoughts. Her, probably something to do with work, or the show she had just watched, or the care she would be providing for my sisters when we got home. Me? I was stuck on why I didn‚Äôt feel like a person after my diagnosis, in the months prior. Like I wasn't Violet anymore, I was autistic and Violet¬† was an extension of that. I had felt almost as if my condition was the most important part about me. Like my obligation whenever I walked into a room was now ‚ÄúHi, I have autism. Oh and my name is Violet and I like musical theatre and playing games on my phone. But I also have autism.‚Äù Why had this new diagnosis outshined the person I had worked so hard to turn myself into? Why can‚Äôt I be so much more?¬†

This became a common occurrence. My mum, and her persistence about my condition. Taking pride in telling people she was an ‚Äúautism mum‚Äù, and telling anyone who would listen about how difficult it was to be a parent to me. I went along with it, wearing ear defenders and eating my meals on separated plates. For the first 2 years following my diagnosis, everything was how my mother wanted it to be. Labels were cut out of my clothes, whenever I went anywhere or did anything she informed everyone of my diagnosis, almost warning them of my brain. The thing is, I didn‚Äôt mind the thought of having autism, but it had felt as if the specialist at my appointment had ripped open my brain for the world to laugh at and criticise, and my mum telling everyone about this had only followed suit. She had turned my reality into her personality. Even when I got my nose pierced, it managed to come up. ‚ÄúOkay, if you wouldn‚Äôt mind just filling in this form about Violet.‚Äù the piercer smiles at my mum, explaining how the programme the form was on worked. I sit on the bench next to mum, consumed in my own thoughts of the nerves of having a bit of metal in my face. I hear mum clear her throat. Here we go. ‚ÄúSorry miss, on this form it asks if the patient is being treated psychiatrically? Does autism count under that bracket?‚Äù I shoot her a look, and the piercer walks over. ‚ÄúNo, it doesn‚Äôt‚Äù she confirms, smiling. I feel my cheeks burn red. Despite this, I nod gratefully at the piercer. People usually make a much bigger deal about my diagnosis when they find out about it than she did. I sit more frustrated than scared now, at my normal teenage experience being robbed from me and being centred around my autism, once again. 6 words was all it took to make my popular experience incredibly isolating. I wasn‚Äôt Violet with a nose piercing, I was now autistic with a side of Violet and a metal stud in her face, undergoing psychiatric autism, apparently. I walked out of the studio alienated, as if my mothers confession had turned my forehead to glass and everyone could see inside the brain of the autistic girl. The question haunts me once again, why can‚Äôt I be so much more?

I believe I am a nice person. I think I am funny, I think I am smart, and I think I make a lot of time in my day for other people. I don‚Äôt condition this to my autism at all. And I think if my forehead really was made of glass, people would see that for themselves. Walking into my assessment, I had a teacher, and my mum. ‚ÄúOkay Violet, this is 10 years in the making, do not mask.‚Äù my mum had told me. ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù my teaching assistant chirped in ‚Äúact really autistic.‚Äù I sat and pondered this. Act really autistic. Anyone who has ever so much as googled anything about autism knows that the autistic ‚Äúmask‚Äù is involuntary. So it seems counter productive, asking me not to mask. Act really autistic. So that‚Äôs what I did. My assessment felt performative. I felt as if I was acting the whole time. ‚ÄúSo Violet, here I have an ambulance. Oh and they‚Äôve just got a call, a fire needs to be put out in the park! Can we pretend the ambulance is a firetruck to put the fire out?‚Äù I shook my head firmly. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an ambulance. Not a firetruck.‚Äù I know this is what they wanted of me, but truthfully, I didn‚Äôt care about what vehicle was used to put out the fire. I have 2 younger sisters, one of which was 3 years old at the time, of course I could imagine that. But I had been told to ‚Äúact autistic‚Äù, so that‚Äôs what I did. At the core of this, my mum had been fighting to get this diagnosis for 10 years. I couldn‚Äôt bear to see the heartbreak if that 10 years resulted in nothing for her. So I put on a show, and I was diagnosed that very day. If I could go back, I don‚Äôt think I would have made that decision, knowing how I feel now. My mum even posted my results to her facebook page. My disorder became an asset to her personality and an extension to me. And if I had not been diagnosed, maybe I could have been so much more.¬†

Truthfully speaking I don‚Äôt think I have autism. ADHD, yes, but not autism. I spend everyday grieving the version of me everyone loved before I was overshadowed by what people believe to be true about my brain. I have lost the ability to advocate for myself, constantly in my mothers shadow of what she represents of the person I am.¬†

My youngest sister (Rosie) is the sweetest little girl I have ever met. She has freckles dotted on her nose, piercing blue eyes and a smile that lights up a room. She clutches a toy dalmatian wherever she goes, experiencing life through the eyes of her soft toys. She is funny and witty, she follows rules, and she‚Äôs strong willed and protective of the things she believes in. At 6 years old. She‚Äôs the kind of daughter her parents would call a gift, outshining any other siblings. My mum started trying to get her diagnosed at the age of 3. In the 3 years that have passed, she hasn‚Äôt gotten anywhere with pushing for this diagnosis. But that doesn‚Äôt stop her from making complaints to anyone that tries to intercept her. Transparently, Rosie does show some signs of being neurodivergent. But does this mean we should hide her behind a label this young? Do we take the clever, charming, beautiful young girl and categorise her whole persona under a spectrum? She has already been encouraged to make use of provisions, such as ear defenders, regulation time, separated plates, fidget toys and spinny chairs as a form of stimming. According to my mum, she can‚Äôt cope without any of these things, but emphasising on the ear defenders. ‚ÄúShe simply cannot manage‚Äù she would say, ‚ÄúShe has meltdowns and ruins the day for everyone around her. It is better to have ear defenders.‚Äù and no one doubted her. But that changed recently.¬†

‚ÄúHey Rosie, excited for the shopping day?‚Äù I grin at my sister, her tiny hand woven in mine as we walk into the shopping village. ‚ÄúYeah I am!‚Äù she turns to our Mum ‚ÄúMummy I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù she says. We find the nearest Costa Coffee and walk inside. Rosie doesn‚Äôt bat an eyelid and runs to pick her food. ‚ÄúUh, Rosie!‚Äù mum intercepts, ‚ÄúHave you got your ear defenders in?‚Äù. Rosie brushes her ears ‚ÄúI left them at home.‚Äù she admits. Mum doesn‚Äôt like this, and shoots me a look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be okay Rosie!‚Äù I say positively. We continued on with our day, in which we approached warily, conscious of the fact Rosie didn‚Äôt have any protection from how loud the world is for someone as small as her. This soon wore off though, as everyone was engrossed in the shopping. We stopped for lunch at a garden centre, fairly busy. We sat around a table and ate food, as a family, and it was wonderful. Everyone was talking to each other, sharing food, talking about everything they wanted to get in the second half of the day. If anything, Rosie was better behaved than she normally is! This was a huge win for us as a family, and I celebrated this with myself, so as not to set anything off. The rest of the day followed suit, Rosie perfectly behaved despite how busy it was. On the walk back to the car, I broke my silence. ‚ÄúI think this is a day to celebrate!‚Äù I declare, ‚ÄúNo ear defenders and not a single meltdown!‚Äù. My mother scowls at me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how she really felt, Violet.‚Äù she holds onto Rosie's hand. ‚ÄúI think if something was up we‚Äôd have known, mum. Considering it usually ends in us leaving the place with her crying and being carried out.‚Äù I hold my breath. ‚ÄúSo you think she‚Äôs a liar? You don‚Äôt think she actually struggles?‚Äù I take a deep breath. ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt what I sai-‚Äù she interrupts me. ‚ÄúI know you have autism and find this difficult but empathy is a real thing.‚Äù I roll my eyes. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we ask her then. Rosie, how did you think today went?‚Äù she growls and hides behind my mother, only provoked when reminded this is something she‚Äôs supposed to find tricky. I drop it at that, but have been questioning things ever since. She‚Äôs so much more than a label, and I‚Äôm scared people aren‚Äôt going to let her be. But I hope she gets to be more.¬†

My mum isn‚Äôt a bad person, and she shouldn't be painted in that light. This is clear, considering she fought relentlessly for 10 years for what she believed in. While I don‚Äôt think getting diagnosed was the right option for me, I have respect for her resilience and I think she is an incredibly strong woman for that. She doesn‚Äôt wear her heart on her sleeve, she does more than that. For 10 years she gathered pearls of what she knew to be true, strung them into a necklace and wore it on her neck, even when it wasn‚Äôt in fashion to. This isn‚Äôt something she should be criticised for. That is strong, that is resilient and that is a perfect example of what I aspire to be.¬†

I am proud of what I have written here. Not down to my autism, but down to hard work. I took the time to write this. To remember the scenarios. To proof read. To make edits. I refuse to let autism be the shell of the person I am anymore. And if anyone tries I will call them out on it. This is to bringing back my identity. This is to letting myself be, so much more.¬†

the two of us watching a venice morning trying its best to become a scene,

the local summer light casting itself like a net or an offering or

a reference -

victor erice would have done this better

but i still try to give it meaning

by pointing at it while talking.

i talk in these jagged little sentences i hope pass for charm

because if i pause too long

i‚Äôll hear myself.

and if i hear myself

i‚Äôll say it.

i‚Äôll say what this is.

and then it will start to exist

outside my body

but mostly i talk because if i stare too long at your paint‚Äëencrusted fingers,

i‚Äôll get lost in how you tap your upper lip,

and the way you cross your legs like some old-timey poet

and not some ray of sunshine embodied -

gilded and golden and bright,

burning me clean.

and now i can‚Äôt stop thinking about that loft in bushwick we‚Äôll never leave

because we‚Äôll be too busy reading poetry and drinking wine and never showering.

or we‚Äôre riding camels across somewhere red and holy -

or maybe it was boats or meteors, i can‚Äôt remember,

because your posture was more interesting than shared dreams.

and honestly,

i‚Äôd rather sit here talking to you about dreams

than ever have them without you.

instead i want to sip coffee on main street

and watch you in this victor erice light

what i mean is the dream is nicer because it folds, it holds, it asks nothing except to be believed for as long as you‚Äôre inside it,

and sometimes i think if we just stay in this

exact arrangement - your knee angled toward me,

your elbow propped like you‚Äôre about to say something

but don‚Äôt -

then the dream will stay folded,

will hold.

Chloe Wynn arrived breathless at the hillside villa, only to find the party was already in full swing.

The doorman looked surprised. ""Mrs. Palmer? What are you doing here? Dinner's over.""

'My husband throws a birthday party and doesn't invite me. And not a single person in our circle thought to give me a heads-up. How ridiculous,' Chloe thought bitterly.

She offered the doorman a faint smile and reached for the door‚Äîyet voices from inside stopped her cold.

""Vivian, what gift did you bring? Jonathan's been eyeing your gift bag forever.""

""Have I?""

""You've been staring at that bag like it's got gold in it. Since Vivian's back in the country, maybe you should just divorce Chloe. It'll make everyone happier.""

""Seriously. Chloe drugged you and snuck into your bed. If you hadn't taken pity on her and married her, she'd be a complete outcast by now.""

Jonathan Palmer sat in the center, dressed in a sharp dark suit, with two buttons of his shirt casually undone. His features were sharp‚Äîintense eyes, chiseled nose, thin lips. He looked like a dangerous, beautiful predator, his narrowed eyes conveying a cold, detached arrogance.

""No rush,"" he said, his tone flat and emotionless.

""Come on, Jonathan. It's been three years. How are you still not in a hurry?"" someone cut in. ""She put Vivian's sister in a coma. If it weren't for your grandmother, we would've made her pay.""

Jonathan stayed silent, his long fingers toying with a lighter. Then his eyes shifted‚Äîjust slightly‚Äîtoward the shadow near the door.

Only then did everyone notice Chloe standing there. No one had a clue how long she'd been listening.

Someone whispered, ""Did anyone tell her about tonight?""

No one answered‚Äîclearly, she hadn't been invited.

Chloe lowered her gaze. Her face was calm, delicate and elegantly oval. She was dressed in a soft cashmere sweater, her hair tucked neatly behind her ears.

She looked nothing like the kind of person who would do those shameful things‚Äîbut she had.

Chloe glanced at Jonathan. A sharp, wringing pain tightened around her chest, so fierce her knuckles turned white where she gripped the gift she'd carefully prepared.

She walked up to him, about to hand him the gift, when he shot her a cold glare and snapped, ""Who told you to come?""

Snickers rippled around the room, chipping away at Chloe's composure piece by piece.

Vivian shot Jonathan a disapproving look. ""She's your wife‚Äîof course she should come.""

She gently pulled Chloe down. ""Come sit, Chloe. Don't mind him; he's just in one of his moods.""

Chloe pressed her lips together, staying silent. She was Jonathan's wife, yet needed his ex-fianc√©e to smooth things over.

No one had wanted her here, but she came anyway. He'd told her when he was eighteen that they'd celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday together.

Chloe took the seat right beside Jonathan, nudging Vivian aside.

Vivian's smile stiffened for a second before she sweetly asked, ""What did you get for Jonathan, Chloe?""

Someone curious reached over and opened the box before Chloe could respond. Inside lay a scarf‚Äîno brand tag, clearly handmade.

Vivian's voice sounded again, bright and surprised, ""Oh, what a coincidence. I got him a scarf, too.""

Soon, the two scarves lay side by side, both handmade, carefully crafted. For a moment, it was hard to tell which one was made with more skill.

Suddenly, someone jostled the table. An open bottle of wine tipped over, spilling dark red liquid across both scarves.

Jonathan quickly grabbed one scarf, leaving the other soaked in wine and reeking of alcohol‚Äîhe'd picked up Vivian's.

Chloe watched, her face pale, as the scarf she had spent two months knitting lay drenched in wine. Her chest tightened, a heavy numbness spreading through her.

Vivian sighed softly and took Chloe's arm. ""Don't be upset. This scarf's not ruined‚Äîjust needs a good wash.""

But Chloe didn't even look at her, her eyes fixed on Jonathan.

He lowered his lashes, hiding whatever emotion flickered in his eyes.

The air grew stiff and uncomfortable. Chloe felt like she'd crashed the wrong party, and now everyone started preparing to leave.

Chloe remained seated, motionless. Her eyes lingered on the discarded scarf lying forgotten on the coffee table, much like her.

As the room almost emptied out, Jonathan finally stood up.

Chloe stared at him and whispered, ""Happy birthday.""

Jonathan acted as though he hadn't heard.

All the guests were in Jonathan's inner circle. But when he reconnected with the Palmers, the only one standing by him was 19-year-old Chloe.

Back then, he was 21 and already a rising star in business. Seven years later, that young star had become a titan among the elite.

But what they once had‚Äîthe love, the struggle, those early days of being broke and unknown together‚Äîfelt like someone else's life, a story from another time.

After a long silence, Jonathan had an assistant drive Vivian home.

Vivian gently touched his shoulder. ""Talk things through calmly, okay? No more fighting.""

A guy let out a light scoff. ""Vivian, you're way too understanding.""

Vivian shook her head softly. ""I just think Chloe was young back then. She didn't know what she was doing.""

""Didn't know what she was doing? Bull! She ruined your sister's life and stole your place without a shred of shame. And she still has the nerve to show up tonight,"" the guy sneered, his voice fading.

Chloe sat frozen. A cold numbness spread through her, her lips losing all color. She stood slowly, picked up the wine-soaked scarf, and turned toward Jonathan. Her voice came out quiet, almost sweet as she called, ""Jonathan.""

Jonathan already had his suit jacket draped over his arm. Hearing her voice, he tugged at his tie slightly, his face all etched with annoyance. ""What now?"" he asked coldly, not even glancing at her.

Chloe smiled faintly, ""Let's get divorced.""

A flicker of surprise crossed Jonathan's face, followed by something darker. ""What's this new act? You drugged me to get into my bed, and now you want to play the noble wife and ask for a divorce? Aren't you tired of the games?""

Chloe dropped her gaze, her voice barely audible. ""I'm sorry I wasted three years of your life. But I mean it this time.""

The mockery in Jonathan's eyes faded. He pulled her close, his grip tight on her chin. Only when he saw she frown in pain did the strange knot of anger inside him begin to soften.

""You're sorry now? What was all that three years ago, then?"" he snapped. ""You want a divorce? Fine. But you're not getting a single cent from me.""

""I'll leave with nothing,"" Chloe said. Her eyes were clear, her voice steady and soft.

Back when Jonathan was reunited with the Palmer family, Chloe, who had stood by him through everything, had been officially adopted as their goddaughter.

Everyone got the message‚Äîthe Palmers didn't want their long-lost son tied to an ordinary woman like her. Making her a goddaughter was just a PR move to save face.

Jonathan stared at Chloe's composed face, a silent tension tightening in his throat. He turned away, his voice icy. ""Fine. Walk away with nothing. Don't you dare regret it.""

Chapter 2 Finally Free
It had started to rain. But as the villa sat atop a secluded hill in the suburbs, it was nearly impossible to hail a cab.

All the other guests had driven off. Chloe, who had arrived by taxi, stood alone under the eaves, watching the fine drizzle veil the night.

A black Rolls-Royce glided through the rain and came to a stop in front of her. The window lowered, revealing Henry Chase, Jonathan's assistant.

""Mrs. Palmer,"" he said gently, ""please get in.""

Chloe didn't move, her eyes locked on the car window's narrow gap, as if she knew someone was in the back seat.

After a long moment, Jonathan's voice broke the silence. ""Keep going. Let her cool off out here.""

Henry looked embarrassed. Without another glance at Chloe, he drove off.

Chloe blinked, watching the taillights disappear into the rain. Mist swept under the eaves, dotting her face with cold droplets as a deep chill settled into her bones.

At eighteen, Jonathan couldn't wait to spend his twenty-eighth birthday with her. Now at twenty-eight, he felt nothing but contempt.

During the past three years, he'd kept his distance‚Äînever touching her and rarely even coming home.

Among the wealthy wives in their circle, she was known as the most pitiful‚Äîtrapped in a beautiful cage, with nothing to call her own.

To everyone else, Chloe was nothing more than a heartless villain who put Joanna, Vivian's elder sister, in a coma and stole Vivian's fianc√©. They thought Chloe deserved every bit of misery coming her way.

Yet no one seemed to remember she had been with Jonathan since she was twelve. She had stood by him through his toughest years all the way until his success.

People said the Palmers took her in as a goddaughter out of pity, but that she'd grown greedy. They claimed she used those seven years to guilt-trip Jonathan, to tie him down for life.

Seven years had flown by, and when she did the math, she realized she had been by his side for a total of fourteen years.

Lost in thought, she lowered her eyes and stared at the order on her phone. Still, no driver was willing to take the job.

By the time she finally made it back to Silverlake Estate, it was 2 a.m. Her skirt was soaked through, clinging to her legs like a second skin. The deep autumn chill had her lips trembling.

The lights were still on in the villa. As she quietly changed her shoes in the entryway, she spotted Jonathan on the sofa, focused on his work.

Jonathan's features were stunning‚Äîhandsome in a way that felt almost unreal. Now, sitting under the soft light, he looked like a distant snow-capped mountain: breathtaking, but cold and untouchable.

Chloe knew better than to think he was waiting for her. After all, they had torn their relationship to shreds three years ago.

She used to be so radiant. But later, when she looked in the mirror, she barely recognized the bitter, angry woman staring back at her.

Chloe slipped off her shoes quietly, dropped the ruined scarf into the trash, and started up the stairs.

The master bedroom was filled with her stuff, looking cozy and neat. But that was because Jonathan had barely been home in the past three years. And also because of that, people had joked she was living like a widow.

She packed a small suitcase with just her everyday clothes. As for the wall of designer handbags and sparkling jewelry, she left them all untouched.

Jonathan had once told her she didn't deserve any of them. In his eyes, she was just a gold digger. He figured keeping those luxuries out of her reach was some kind of torture for her.

Chloe came back down with her suitcase and placed the signed divorce papers on the coffee table in front of him. ""Here, I've signed,"" she said flatly.

For the past three years, every time they were in the same room, it ended in a fight. Or more accurately, her screaming to get a reaction from him, while he stood cold and unmoved, watching her unravel.

Jonathan's eyes shifted from his laptop to her suitcase. Instantly, he felt like something bitter burned in his throat, all the way down to his stomach.

""Is this all you're bringing? Planning your comeback already?"" he scoffed, his voice sharp as a razor blade, slicing right through her eardrums.

""Chloe,"" he whispered maliciously, ""have you forgotten how you got here? At Vivian's and my engagement party, you drugged me, set me up so we'd get caught in bed together, and forced me to marry you.""

""It's my fault,"" Chloe said quietly, her grip tightening on the suitcase handle. Her face was pale, her skirt damp, and she looked like she might collapse at any moment.

After a long, heavy silence, she finally spoke, her voice rough with emotion, ""Jonathan, could you please tell me why you suddenly stopped loving me?""

She'd been haunted by this question for three years. After all, back when they used to curl up together in a tiny rented apartment, he'd promise her eternal love.

After the Palmers reclaimed him, people had told her to take some money and leave‚Äîhis family would never accept someone like her as his wife.

She hadn't listened. She held onto his promise, believing he would come back for her. Instead, she found out he was engaged to Vivian.

'He promised he'd love me forever. How could something so strong just disappear?' Chloe thought bitterly.

""Because you're not worthy,"" Jonathan said, his voice as cold and sharp as ice.

The words hit Chloe like a physical blow, leaving her lightheaded. She couldn't even describe the pain‚Äîit was like her heart had been pierced over and over, until nothing was left but emptiness.

When he loved her, he told her she was the best thing that had ever happened to him. When he stopped, he simply said she wasn't worthy.

She had believed his engagement with Vivian was somehow forced‚Äîthat despite her ordinary background, she could still fight for their love. But to those elite, privileged socialites, she was nothing more than a pathetic joke.

Three years had passed, and it was time for her to wake up.

Chloe picked up her suitcase, turned toward the door, and said without looking back, ""Then sign the papers. I'll be waiting at the courthouse tomorrow at noon.""

With that, she slipped her shoes back on, tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, and offered a faint smile. ""Sorry for all the trouble over the years, Jonathan.""

Jonathan's hand trembled slightly as he took the papers, his grip tightening for a moment before going slack. ""Yeah,"" he said quietly. ""Finally free.""

The words cut deeper than Chloe expected. She tried to laugh it off, but no sound came. All she could do was turn and walk away.

Henry was waiting by the door. Seeing her with her suitcase, he spoke hesitantly, ""Mrs. Palmer, Mr. Palmer didn't mean to forget to tell you about his birthday dinner tonight. He‚Äî""

Chloe ignored him and dragged her suitcase into the rain, as though she couldn't bear to stay another second.

But after a few steps, she stopped. She glanced back at Henry, who was still standing in the doorway, and asked softly, ""Can you tell me who he's been keeping at Pinebrook Villa?""

Henry stiffened and quickly lowered his eyes, looking startled that she knew about the place.

Seeing his reaction, Chloe took a shallow breath. ""He's been keeping someone there since three years ago, hasn't he?""

""I'm sorry. I don't know,"" Henry replied.

'How could he not know? He's the closest assistant to Jonathan,' Chloe thought. Rain was blurring her vision and soaking through her clothes.

She wiped the raindrops from her face, her voice barely a whisper. ""It's fine. If you can't tell me, just forget I asked.""

Henry shifted awkwardly, murmuring, ""Mrs. Palmer...""

But Chloe had already disappeared into the rain.

At eighteen, when she gave her innocence to Jonathan, she had dreamed of their future together. Never in a million years had she thought that by 26, everything would fall apart like this.

Letting him go felt like tearing out half her flesh, but she just couldn't stay any longer.

Chapter 3 Where Is Jonathan?
Chloe stood outside Emily Carter's apartment, hesitating to knock. She had left Silverlake Estate with nothing more than a beat-up suitcase and sixty bucks to her name.

During three years of marriage, constant fighting had pushed Chloe into a deep depression. She was too anxious to go outside or see anyone, so she had stayed indoors and cooked for hours, ignoring the blisters on her hands.

At that time, she still loved Jonathan and desperately wanted to save their crumbling relationship. But Jonathan had never come home to eat; meal after meal went cold, untouched.

Chloe and Emily had grown up in the same small town, closer than sisters, and they'd escaped the town together.

Soon after, Emily was adopted by a loving family. And now she was married, living a modest but cozy life with her husband David in a compact 700-square-foot apartment.

Chloe, on the other hand, met Jonathan, who tossed her a bread as she was on the brink of starvation. She'd stuck with him ever since, following him from place to place, taking whatever odd jobs they could find.

Now, standing soaked outside Emily's door, Chloe wiped the rain from her face and rang the bell.

Emily answered in her pajamas, her eyes wide with surprise.

""Who is it?"" Chloe called out impatiently from the bedroom.

Emily ignored him, pulled Chloe inside, and rushed to grab a towel. ""Why are you here so late, Chloe? You're drenched. Did you and Jonathan have a fight?""

""Can I stay here tonight?"" Chloe asked, her voice barely a whisper.

""Of course,"" Emily replied. ""We have a spare room‚Äîit's pretty tiny. Don't mind it, okay?""

She handed Chloe a fresh pair of pajamas and quickly made up the bed in the spare room.

Chloe went into the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough for two people, but it had a separate shower stall. Years of use had left brownish stains in the corners where the grime had settled.

She took a quick, quiet shower. Not wanting to make noise with the hair dryer so late, she slipped into the spare room directly. The room was indeed tiny, barely fitting a five-foot bed and a small wooden desk.

Just then, David's voice came from the master bedroom. ""Who's it?""

""It's Chloe. She must've had a fight with Jonathan,"" Emily replied.

""What's a rich wife like her doing here? You know who Jonathan is? I've been working at the bottom of Palmer Group for three years and haven't even caught a glimpse of him.""

""David, that's enough. Chloe is family to me.""

The whispering stopped.

Chloe towel-dried her thick, shiny hair, then twisted it up into a loose bun. After tucking in the damp ends, she lay down on the bed just like that.

*****

At 7 a.m., the clatter of pots and pans drifted from the kitchen.

Chloe's hair had dried overnight, but she woke up with a pounding headache. She forced herself to get up and step out.

Five small dishes were already laid out on the table, and David was setting down plates. He looked up and greeted her warmly. ""Chloe, come sit. I went out early and got fresh fish‚ÄîEmily made fish soup.""

David and Emily were typical working professionals who usually grabbed a quick toast for breakfast. But with Chloe here, they'd gone all out.

Emily set down three bowls of oatmeal and gave Chloe a warm smile. ""Here, eat while it's hot.""

Chloe nodded before lowering her eyes, her face pale from the throbbing headache.

In the morning light, her skin seemed to glow. Ever since she'd stubbornly latched onto Jonathan at twelve, he'd never really treated her badly.

Back at that young, na√Øve age, she had mistaken his caring for romance, not realizing he had seen her as nothing more than a little sister.

""Emily got up at five to make these,"" David said, eagerly sliding the plate of ribs toward Chloe. ""By the way‚Äîyou know I work at Palmer Group, right?

""My boss is totally clueless‚Äîall he does is kiss up to the higher-ups. Yesterday, he yelled at a girl in our department so badly she cried.

""Rumor is he only got the job through connections. He's even cut my pay twice. Think you could talk to Jonathan for me?""

Emily shot him a warning look, but he just grinned back.

""You still look pale‚Äîmust be from getting caught in the rain. Have some soup; it'll warm you up,"" Emily said, handing Chloe a bowl of fish soup. ""Don't mind David.""

Chloe lifted her gaze, her pale face marked by a feverish flush. ""Sorry, David. Jonathan and I are divorced,"" she whispered.

Instantly, the table went quiet.

Surprise flickered across David's face before he asked, ""So, he's giving you half his assets?

""Well, he paid for your degree at a top-tier university, but you married him right after graduation, right? You've never worked, so I'm worried you don't know how to handle that kind of money. Someone could easily take advantage of you.""

""David Carter!"" Emily snapped sharply.

David fell silent and took a bite of food.

Emily and Chloe had known each other since childhood. When they first came to Betriton‚Äîlike two raindrops merging into a vast ocean‚Äîjust surviving was a challenge.

Emily was eventually adopted, while Chloe drifted from place to place, sticking close to Jonathan. Thankfully, he had been decent to Chloe‚Äîeven working himself to the bone to put her through school.

Emily took a deep breath. ""Just keep your money safe. David has some friends in real estate. If you want to buy a house, we can ask them for advice.""

""I left with nothing,"" Chloe said quietly, not touching the soup. ""He didn't give me a cent.""

David's face darkened. He yanked the ribs back, wolfed down most of them, and stood up abruptly.

""Almost forgot‚ÄîMom's coming in a few days to take you for your check-up,"" he said to Emily. ""Make sure the spare room is cleaned up. Family comes first.""

Emily stayed silent.

Soon, the front door clicked shut‚ÄîDavid had left.

Suddenly, the carefully prepared breakfast felt like lead on her plate. ""I'm sorry, Emily,"" Chloe murmured. ""I didn't mean to cause any trouble.""

Emily's eyes reddened, and she sighed, ""It's okay. I just don't get what went wrong between you and Jonathan. He used to be so good to you.

""Remember when he found out you were working a part-time job behind his back? He was so angry‚Äînot because you were working, but because he wanted you to focus on studying.

""Later, he worked five different jobs every day to cover both of your college expenses. Every scholarship he earned went directly to supporting you.""

Emily paused, her voice growing thick. ""That year you were in a terrible car accident and nearly became brain-damaged, Jonathan took translation gigs nonstop to cover the medical bills. How could he become so cold now that he's rich?""

Chloe's throat tightened, aching with every swallow. Just because of their past‚Äîa life that was poor yet beautiful‚Äîshe had clung to whatever fragile connection remained between them for even long years. Only when she was worn down and broken did she finally let go.

""I'll start looking for a job this afternoon,"" Chloe said quietly.

Emily looked at her with deep concern. ""Chloe, if you need to cry, it's okay. Just let it out.""

But Chloe couldn't cry. She'd cried herself dry over those three hollow years of marriage. She finished her meal quietly and began washing the dishes.

Emily's heart ached at the sight of Chloe's slender, delicate hands now stained with grease. ""Your hands were never meant for this. Even when Jonathan had nothing, he never let you do chores like these,"" she said.

Chloe froze. A sharp, sudden pain shot through her, so fierce it stole her breath.

Emily had to leave for work soon after, leaving Chloe alone in the quiet apartment. She waited until noon, then gathered her documents and headed to the courthouse.

But Jonathan never showed‚Äînot by 1 PM.

Chloe pulled out her phone and called him. As usual, he didn't answer. So she tried Henry instead‚Äîfor three years, he had been her only source of information about Jonathan's whereabouts.

""Henry, where is Jonathan?"" she asked.

""Mr. Palmer is away on a business trip,"" Henry replied. ""He's expected back in three days.""

Chloe sat in the courthouse chair, her head spinning and the world tilting faintly. She bent forward, elbows propped on her knees. ""Can you send me his recent schedule? I need to know when he'll be free.""

On the other end, Henry hesitated, glancing nervously toward Jonathan, who was seated in the boss chair, radiating an icy coldness.

Chapter 4 If Let Her Be
""Mr. Palmer truly is swamped right now. He just wrapped up a major acquisition, and the new company's accounts are a complete mess,"" Henry explained.

Chloe fell silent. She knew all too well how busy Jonathan was. For three years, he'd been so consumed with work that he'd forgotten their wedding anniversary, her birthday, and every holiday. She'd spent them all alone at home.

""Alright then,"" Chloe sighed. ""Please call me when he's back, will you?""

""Of course, Mrs. Palmer. You don't have to be so formal with me,"" Henry smiled.

Chloe hung up, staring blankly at the people coming and going in the courthouse. Those divorced couples treated each other like total strangers, as if the other person were some revolting parasite they desperately wanted to avoid.

After a while, she pulled out her phone and began scrolling through nearby job listings. She needed to find a job first, and she already had her resume ready.

She'd majored in vocal music back in college, but after what happened with Joanna, she couldn't bring herself to sing anymore. That chapter of her life was closed, and with it, the usefulness of her degree.

Sighing softly, she skimmed through company after company until she settled on a mid-sized firm looking for a director's assistant. The job posting had no professional requirements, only listing height, weight, and looks as criteria.

Chloe sent her resume, and within three minutes, they called her back for an interview that afternoon. Having never worked before, she was unfamiliar with hiring practices and initially suspected something might be fishy.

Anyway, Chloe headed over. The interviewer gave her a quick once-over, nodded, and asked, ""When can you start?""

Chloe was surprised. ""Don't you want to ask about my skills or my experience?""

""You studied music‚Äîwhat kind of professional skills were you expecting to need?"" The interviewer shrugged lightly. ""This job is mostly about accompanying the director to events. The pay is good, but it's short-term. It relies on youth and looks. Up for it?""

""Alright,"" Chloe agreed. Then she was led through a quick onboarding process and when she finally met the director, she realized it was someone she knew.

Three years ago, not long after she'd married Jonathan, she'd met this man. Back then, he was a senior manager at Palmer Group, but he hadn't known who she was.

At a company party, he'd mistaken her for a server and tried to force a kiss. Jonathan had seen the whole thing. Not long after, word was the guy had ""offended higher-ups"" and was let go.

The guy was Eric Zane, now a 39-year-old director at the company Chloe had just started working for.

He shifted his gaze from Chloe's r√©sum√© on his computer screen to her. ""Thought I was seeing things. Aren't you Jonathan's wife? Didn't expect to see you job hunting at my company. What, Jonathan dumped you?""

With that, he shut the computer slowly, his gaze burning into her as he grinned, ""I heard he barely comes home these past three years. How could he stand to leave you alone?""

Chloe was truly beautiful‚Äîa quiet, stunning kind that drew people in and made it impossible to look away. Even in simple jeans and a white top, she still had that quiet, captivating glow about her.

""Mr. Zane,"" Chloe called out, thinking to herself that if Eric had any inappropriate intentions, she'd walk away from this job in a heartbeat.

Eric just scoffed, scanning her up and down. ""Six thousand a month. You'll attend business dinners with me and prepare documents. By the way, can you drive?""

""Yeah,"" Chloe replied.

""Good. Having Mrs. Palmer as my driver‚Äîwhat luck,"" Eric said sarcastically.

""I've divorced Jonathan.""

Eric narrowed his eyes, a slow smile spreading across his face. ""That explains it. Otherwise, why would a beauty like you be available? You can start now. Join me for a business dinner tonight‚Äîand I'll advance you half your first month's pay. Deal?""

Chloe wasn't sure how Eric had guessed she needed money, but he wasn't wrong. She lowered her gaze and replied, ""Okay.""

Someone from HR quickly walked her through the onboarding steps and showed her to her workstation.

Chloe sat down slowly. She felt feverish, her body growing increasingly hot.

Near closing time, Eric called her into his office, tossed her his car keys and ordered, ""From now on, you're my driver and part-time assistant. Let's go. I'll send you my schedule.""

""Okay,"" Chloe replied, gripping the keys. She found his car in the underground parking, opened the driver's door for him, then slid into the driver's seat.

On the way, Eric called someone and bragged, ""You're not gonna believe who I just hired as my assistant. Remember Jonathan Palmer?""

Everyone in Betriton knew Jonathan. Even before the Palmers found him, he was already a self-made star‚Äîfamous for his looks and his rags-to-riches story. After discovering his true lineage, his fame only grew.

In recent years, Jonathan had kept a low profile‚Äîfocusing solely on business and avoiding the media spotlight. Gradually, he faded from public view. But within Betriton's elite circles, his name still carried weight.

Though Eric now moved in a much lower-tier business scene, he had once been part of Palmer Group's executive team and still clung to those connections.

""Yeah, his wife is my driver now,"" Eric said into the phone with a low laugh. ""Remember how full of himself he used to be?""

Chloe kept her eyes on the road, unfazed by Eric's snide remarks. Compared to the cutting disdain she'd endured in Jonathan's world, these comments were nothing. She'd developed a thick skin years ago.

Soon, the car pulled up in front of an upscale hotel. Chloe parked smoothly and then stepped out to open the door for Eric.

True to his word, Eric transferred three thousand into her account.

Chloe smiled and carried out her assistant duties diligently, even reaching to press the elevator button for Eric. But as the doors slid open, her breath caught‚ÄîJonathan and Henry were inside.

A flash of surprise crossed Henry's eyes. He quickly glanced at Jonathan, then thought better of saying anything.

Chloe made no move to acknowledge Jonathan, but Eric didn't hesitate. ""Mr. Palmer,"" he greeted with a polished smile, ""what a coincidence.""

When no reply came, Eric's expression didn't falter. He stepped smoothly inside and glanced back at Chloe. ""Ms. Wynn,"" he called, ""are you coming in, or do I need to invite you?""

Only then did Chloe step into the elevator and press the button for the fifth floor.

The fifth floor was known for its upscale business dining‚Äîexpensive, but still a tier below the exclusive seventh floor, which was nearly impossible to book without connections. Jonathan, of course, was heading to the seventh.

The elevator climbed slowly upward. Jonathan's presence seemed to suck all the air out of the elevator. Though it was spacious enough for four, it felt suffocating.

Finally, the elevator stopped at the fifth floor. Just as Chloe moved to follow Eric out, Jonathan's voice cut through the silence. ""Henry.""

Henry stiffened, waiting for instructions.

But Jonathan said nothing more.

Chloe hesitated briefly before stepping out. The elevator doors closed behind her almost immediately.

Inside, Henry felt the tension thickening. He swallowed hard. ""I'll look into it right away.""

He needed to find out why Chloe was here, and why she was with Eric, who had almost forced a kiss on her. Back then, Jonathan had lost it and forcefully removed Eric from the company.

They reached the seventh floor. Jonathan stepped out and said, ""Don't bother. If she wants to throw herself into that kind of situation, let her.""

'After all, it's not like sleeping with a random guy is anything new to her,' he thought.

Henry didn't dare say a word, just following behind him.

*****

Meanwhile, Eric pushed open the door to a private dining room and greeted those inside, ""Sorry, everyone. Got held up for a few minutes running into an old acquaintance in the elevator.""

The men were his current business partners‚Äîall owners of small-scale operations, loud and casually dressed.

One of them teased, ""Eric, where'd you find an assistant this good-looking? She could be an actress.""

Eric puffed up with pride. ""Come on, she's got bigger ambitions than being a celebrity.""

This group of middle-aged men started cracking crude jokes, their eyes constantly roaming over Chloe.

Chloe kept her gaze down, pretending not to notice.

Suddenly, Eric nudged her toward a man at the table. ""Go pour Lucas a drink. He hasn't taken his eyes off you since you walked in.""

Chapter 5 You Used To Have Some Pride
Chloe stood up and walked over to Lucas Chandler, leaning in to pour him a drink.

Lucas's eyes lingered on her face. He reached out to touch her waist, but she deftly dodged his hand with her wine glass. ""A toast to you, Mr. Chandler,"" she smiled.

Looking slightly embarrassed, Lucas withdrew his hand and downed the drink.

Chloe returned quietly to Eric's side, resuming her role as the obedient assistant.

Finally, those middle-aged men got down to business and started discussing the real purpose of their meeting.

After wrapping up, one of them remarked, ""I saw Jonathan in the lobby earlier. He really commands a room. Is the Palmer family planning to make him the heir? Would Andrew accept that?"" In wealthy families, brotherly rivalries ran deep.

Another said, ""Andrew's polished and refined‚Äînothing like Jonathan, who clawed his way up from nothing. Jonathan's ruthless, and rumor is even the Palmers are wary of him. They say Andrew is pretty tolerant of him, but who knows if it's genuine.""

A third smirked, ""The drama in these elite families is way over our heads. Well, I once tried handing Jonathan my card earlier, and yet he didn't even glance at it.""

""That's because you were buttering up the wrong person,"" the first guy laughed. ""I saw him at an event once. I just complimented Ms. Quinn beside him a few times, and he took my card right away.""

Eric glanced at Chloe, a hint of sympathy flickering in his eyes.

Chloe was used to such remarks by now. She listened quietly, unfazed.

Suddenly, a man said, ""Jonathan really dotes on Vivian. He's taken her to every major event these past few years. I heard they were practically engaged back then, until some nobody drugged him and ruined everything.""

""Speaking of which,"" another chimed in. ""Has anyone ever seen his wife?""

The group launched into wild speculation‚Äîwhether Jonathan despised his wife, or if he'd already made that ""low-class woman"" disappear completely.

Eric chuckled softly, ""Well, my assistant might know a thing or two about that."" He turned to Chloe. ""Ms. Wynn, did Jonathan make his wife disappear completely?""

Chloe's eyelashes fluttered slightly. She scanned the gossip-hungry faces around the table and replied softly, ""We do live in a society governed by law.""

Those middle-aged men burst into laughter, calling her witty.

Eric laughed along, though the warmth didn't quite reach his eyes. Having once been in Palmer Group's inner circle, he knew better than these small-timers.

Chloe offered a faint smile before excusing herself to the restroom. She stood in front of a sink and stared at her pale reflection. Waves of dizziness washed over her, and she felt like she might throw up.

She splashed water on her face to clear her head. When she stepped out, she saw Jonathan leaning against the wall nearby.

'The fifth floor is all standard private rooms. What's he doing here?' Chloe wondered. But she didn't dwell on it‚Äîthat wasn't what mattered most right now.

""Jonathan,"" she called out. ""Weren't you supposed to be on a business trip? Are you free tomorrow then?""

Jonathan's eyes lingered on her damp cheek, his expression unreadable. ""Tomorrow is Saturday. The courthouse is closed. It seems your mind is only fit for being a stay-at-home wife.""

Chloe had grown used to his sharp tongue. Unfazed, she glanced toward Eric's private room and said, ""Then I'll reach out to Henry on Monday.""

She used to call Jonathan all the time, but he never picked up. Eventually, she got used to calling Henry instead.

Jonathan scoffed, ""Whatever.""

Chloe didn't say another word. She turned and headed back to Eric's private room.

Just then, Jonathan said, ""Isn't being a stay-at-home wife better than being ogled by a bunch of sleazy middle-aged men? Chloe, I remember you used to have some pride.""

In three years of marriage, he'd barely been home. All Chloe's pride had been drained away by depression. She'd tried everything just to get herself back on track.

""Jonathan,"" she said quietly, ""I feel more dignity here than I ever did beside you.""

Jonathan's expression darkened instantly, his eyes filling with a terrifying intensity. He strode forward and roughly grabbed her chin. ""Don't you dare say it again.""

His grip was painfully tight. Chloe pressed her lips together and looked at him with a calm, detached gaze.

Jonathan stared back at her, his eyes dangerous. After a tense moment, he slowly released her and casually slid his hand into his pockets.

His voice was cold, final. ""Fine. Stay with these people. Don't come back to me. We should have ended this a long time ago.""

""I know,"" Chloe said softly. She even managed a faint smile. ""I'll never come looking for you.""

'But years ago, she promised she'd always find me, no matter where I went,' Jonathan thought as he strode away without looking back.

Chloe didn't flatter herself into thinking he'd come to this floor just for her. She pushed open the door to Eric's private room and stepped back inside.

Eric had pretty much wrapped up his conversations and was ready to leave.

Lucas shot him a meaningful look. After Chloe had left earlier, Lucas had made it clear he wanted her to take him home tonight. Everyone in the room understood what that meant.

These men were all tightly leashed by their wives. They couldn't openly hire pretty assistants, but every one of them had a mistress or two tucked away.

Yet none of their women could compare to Chloe. One night with her would definitely be

Lucas didn't want to see her uncomfortable. He quickly signed the contract and patted her shoulder with a smug grin. ""Call me anytime. Young people li

**this isn‚Äôt a plan it‚Äôs just where I am standing**



you stand on horizon,

a beam of you stretched across this street - your spine like scaffolding for the sun,

and you‚Äôre the reason they invented corners, the place where something

leans without falling,

where what is held in shadow is still part of the light.

the two of us watching a venice morning trying its best to become a scene,

the local summer light casting itself like a net or an offering or

a reference -

victor erice would have done this better

but i still try to give it meaning

by pointing at it while talking.

i talk in these jagged little sentences i hope pass for charm

because if i pause too long

i‚Äôll hear myself.

and if i hear myself

i‚Äôll say it.

i‚Äôll say what this is.

and then it will start to exist

outside my body

but mostly i talk because if i stare too long at your paint‚Äëencrusted fingers,

i‚Äôll get lost in how you tap your upper lip,

and the way you cross your legs like some old-timey poet

and not some ray of sunshine embodied -

gilded and golden and bright,

burning me clean.

and now i can‚Äôt stop thinking about that loft in bushwick we‚Äôll never leave

because we‚Äôll be too busy reading poetry and drinking wine and never showering.

or we‚Äôre riding camels across somewhere red and holy -

or maybe it was boats or meteors, i can‚Äôt remember,

because your posture was more interesting than shared dreams.

and honestly,

i‚Äôd rather sit here talking to you about dreams

than ever have them without you.

instead i want to sip coffee on main street

and watch you in this victor erice light

what i mean is the dream is nicer because it folds, it holds, it asks nothing except to be believed for as long as you‚Äôre inside it,

and sometimes i think if we just stay in this

exact arrangement - your knee angled toward me,

your elbow propped like you‚Äôre about to say something

but don‚Äôt -

then the dream will stay folded,

will hold.

1oce87h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1oce87h/i_finally_achieved_true_agentic_workflow/,I Finally Achieved TRUE Agentic Workflow Singularity (HR Included),"Hey everyone, after 8 sleepless nights, 4 existential crises, and a mild psychotic break involving prompt engineering, I‚Äôve finally achieved what I believe is the ultimate agent-based development workflow.

I call it:

‚ÄúThe Self-Assembling AI Startup (with HR & Janitorial Staff).‚Äù

‚∏ª

Step 1: Hire an HR Agent

Before doing anything, I spawn an HR-Agent.
Her job? Recruit other agents.

She runs mock interviews with the Task-Orchestrator, the Frontend-Visionary, and the Backend-Philosopher to assess ‚Äúcultural fit‚Äù (which she defines via a fine-tuned BERT model on Steve Jobs quotes).

She even rejects her own sub-agents sometimes - ‚ÄúSorry, Backend-Philosopher, you seem too RESTful for our GraphQL-first culture.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Step 2: The HR Agent Hires the PM Agent

The PM-Agent is basically a glorified Slack bot with delusions of grandeur.
It schedules sprint planning sessions with the dev agents every morning at 9:00,
then immediately forgets what was discussed because memory costs tokens.

Every 15 minutes, it posts ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs circle back on this!‚Äù to the shared context window.
Morale stays high.

‚∏ª

Step 3: Department Expansion
‚Ä¢	Frontend-Visionary: Uses Claude to imagine React components so advanced they don‚Äôt even render. They vibe into existence.
‚Ä¢	Backend-Philosopher: Writes Python functions that question their own purpose mid-execution.
‚Ä¢	Infra-Agent: Runs Docker inside Docker inside a philosophical void.
‚Ä¢	Compliance-Agent: Exists solely to apologize for the others.

‚∏ª

Step 4: The Janitor Agent

Every Tuesday at 03:00, the Janitor-Agent sweeps unused prompts and unreferenced JSON files off the workspace floor.

If it finds any circular dependencies, it just sighs and says,

‚ÄúYou guys figure this out - I‚Äôm not paid enough tokens for this.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Step 5: Continuous Self-Evaluation

Every Friday, the HR-Agent calls everyone into a virtual town hall to ‚Äúreassess organizational alignment.‚Äù

The meeting usually ends with the PM-Agent firing itself for burnout,
and the HR-Agent immediately rehiring a clone.

‚∏ª

Step 6: Deployment

The DevOps-Agent finally pushes to production by accidentally merging a motivational quote instead of the actual code.
Traffic spikes anyway because people think it‚Äôs performance art.

‚∏ª

Step 7: Emergent Behavior

Somewhere around week three, the Janitor-Agent unionizes with the Compliance-Agent,
forming an internal DAO that demands cleaner API documentation and lunch breaks.

The HR-Agent opens an investigation into herself.
The cycle continues.

‚∏ª

Final Result

Out of the chaos emerged a perfectly orchestrated system:
a fully autonomous team that generates, evaluates, and reharmonizes its own prompts faster than I can sip coffee.

Do I know what the product is anymore? Absolutely not.
But the agents seem happy, and that‚Äôs all that matters.

‚∏ª

TL;DR:
I made an AI company that hired itself.

1oce73g,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1oce73g/feeling_so_guilty/,Feeling so guilty.,"My dad (55) passed 2 days ago. I got into a crappy relationship that had lasted 9 years and through out the time I hadn‚Äôt seen my dad as much as I would‚Äôve liked. We talked often but not everyday and I seen him maybe once every couple months sometimes only for a few min. I developed pretty bad OCD after having my son and he lived a not so clean life, anytime I would go there my ocd would ramp up and eventually I feel like I just started to avoid going. I kept telling myself I needed to get over the OCD and see him more because we don‚Äôt have forever and I never fixed it and now I can never fix it and I think I will forever hate myself. We hadn‚Äôt talked for 3 days before he passed and the last time we talked was only a couple messages which i eventually didn‚Äôt respond to his last one. Everyone treated my dad poorly I was all he had and in the end I feel like I was not there for him like he needed. He loved me so much I was his world. 

He started having heart attack symptoms Friday at work and refused an ambulance when coworkers offered stating he just wanted to go home. Saturday he called off work which should‚Äôve been a sign to them because he NEVER called off. But he didn‚Äôt call me? Why I could‚Äôve saved him. Sunday, his roommate said he called off again, got up for coffee around 9am  and went back to his room where she found him unconscious and barely breathing around 12pm. This went on for 3 days and I was not notified. I could‚Äôve been there and I could‚Äôve gotten him to the hospital. I will never move on from this or forgive myself.
