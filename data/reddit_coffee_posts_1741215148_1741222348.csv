My wife and I are both 21 and got married recently and fairly young. It is uncommon these days but it works for us. We are currently looking for a new place as she is transferring schools and we will be moving to another state. She works part time and goes to school part time and I work full time. She makes about $1000-1500 per month working retail and I make about $5000 per month after taxes. 

Since we are looking for a place I have been telling her for a few months to make sure we are smart with our money since we will have a lot of move-in expenses. She’s known to overspend and we’ve talked about it in the past. I like buying her stuff within reason, and taking care of her, that’s fine, I usually buy her what she asks and take care of her. I’ve had to get on her a few times over these last few months for ordering door dash or buying expensive coffee instead of packing lunch or using our coffee machine I bought.

Last night she told me she wanted to buy some new pajamas and said it was going to be about $100. I told her “let’s wait” and she told me she already placed the order, and that she didn’t want me to pay for it. I told her it was frustrating that she spent $100 on pajamas when were are planning on moving soon. She tells me “I can spend my own money that I bust my ass to make”. We ended up arguing for 2 hours with her trying to justify why she should be able to spend the $100 because it’s “just one transaction” and that she doesn’t want to be criticized for spending money, and that she should be able to treat herself once in a while, and that she does not want her past to be used against her. 

I pay all of the major bills. Rent, electric, auto insurance. She pays for some of her own bills like phone bills and stuff, and has only contributed a few hundred dollars to her savings of 2024. 

We did not come to a closure in this argument, I still think it’s fair for me to question her spending. She still thinks she should not have to be criticized for spending. I told her criticism is critical to communication and we have to be able to criticize eachother.

Mushroom coffee smoothies, especially those featuring Lion’s Mane, have gained popularity for their energizing properties and health benefits. Combining the rich flavors of coffee with the earthy notes of mushrooms creates a unique drink that not only tastes good but also supports your well-being. Let’s explore the health benefits of these delicious blends and why you should consider adding them to your daily routine.

One of the key ingredients in mushroom coffee smoothies is Lion’s Mane. This medicinal mushroom is known for its impressive benefits, particularly for brain health. Research indicates that Lion's Mane can enhance cognitive functions, improve memory, and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Some of the major health benefits of including Lion’s Mane in your mushroom coffee smoothie include:

- **Enhanced Focus:** Lion’s Mane helps increase the production of nerve growth factor (NGF), which supports the maintenance and growth of neurons. This means you can enjoy improved concentration and sharper mental clarity.
- **Increased Energy Levels:** The combination of coffee and Lion’s Mane provides a balanced boost of energy without the jitters often associated with regular coffee. This makes it perfect for a morning smoothie or a midday pick-me-up.
- **Gut Health:** Lion’s Mane also promotes gut health by encouraging the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. A healthy gut can improve your overall health, digestion, and immune function.
- **Stress Relief:** The adaptogenic properties of Lion’s Mane can help your body cope with stress. This can lead to a calmer mindset, allowing you to approach your tasks with more focus and ease.
- **Antioxidant Boost:** Lion’s Mane is rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress in the body. This helps keep your cells healthy and may play a role in preventing chronic diseases.

To make a delicious mushroom coffee smoothie featuring Lion’s Mane, you can combine it with various ingredients that not only enhance its flavor but also add extra health benefits. Here’s a simple recipe to try:

Before I get into the story, I feel like need to add a trigger warning. This story contains multiple acts of DA and violence. If you are sensitive to these topics, please proceed with caution or skip this story for the benefit of your own mental health. This is also a very long story, so gab a drink or snack and settle in loves. With that out of the way, let's get started.

I created a new account specifically for this post because I do not want to risk the safety of the victim in this story, but I really need y'alls help and advice, because I don't know what to do anymore. I (22F) am living with three roommates at college. All of my roommates are 20 year old females, and for the sake of this story I will be calling them Abby, Becky, and Satan (this will make sense in a bit). I have lived with my roommates for almost two years now, and the first year was pretty uneventful. I have lived in the same apartment off campus since getting into college and have had several different roommates during my time here. I'm pretty reserved and introverted, so I never interacted much with my roommates during our first year together, but since they were all freshmen when they moved in, it was nice to see them get along and become friends (or so I thought). My family has been pushing for me to make friends, so at the start of this school year (Fall 2024) I made an effort to get to know my roommates better. We went out to dinner, went ice skating, got coffee, and did other normal college town activities. I really started to get along with Abby and Becky, but Satan was always a bit more reserved. I didn't push trying to be friends with her, because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable, or feel like she needed to be my friend, but I started getting weird vibes from her.

For some context, I've always had a knack for reading people, partly because I am a very empathetic person, and partly because my dad is a police officer and taught me how to read certain signs on people. I can usually get a good feel on a someone's personality the first time we meet. One example is in middle school when my best friend since childbirth started hanging out with a group of girls that I didn't like very much. There was nothing inherently wrong with being friends with them, I, again, just got bad vibes. Because of this me and my friend grew apart for a couple years before she came back to tell me that I was right about them. I'm not the kind of person who says ""I told you so"", so I just brought her back into my life like no time had passed, and we are still great friends to this day.

That being said, I didn't think Satan was a bad person, I just didn't trust her as much as Abby and Becky. She always acted like she was better than the rest of us. She didn't want anyone she knew to see us out in public together. I ran into her one time at the bus stop heading back to the apartment, and we exchanged pleasantries, but she refused to look at me after that and made sure we didn't sit near each other on the bus. She quickly got off the bus when we got back to the apartment and rushed back to her room so she didn't have to see me. That was the first big sign that something was off. The next was a text conversation that we had regarding a stray kitten I adopted. When I adopted her my roommates agreed that she would be the ""apartment cat"" and we would split the costs of food, litter, and toys. I said that I would pay for her medical bills since it was my idea to adopt her in the first place. I thought that everything was fine until Satan started complaining about the litter box smell. We all agreed that the litter box would be in the common area since our rooms are very small, and I already had a dog who sleeps in my room. We hadn't even had her for a week before she started complaining. I did move the litter box to my room like she asked, but when I asked for her portion of the cost for the cat she refused. She claimed that since it was not ""her"" cat she did not have to pay for anything. I was a little upset, but could understand why she didn't want to pay. The thing I did not like was the tone and disrespect she gave me when she told me all of this in her text. It was so arrogant and disrespectful that just thinking about it while writing this is making my blood pressure rise. Since the cat's littler box was now in my room, and I was paying for her medical bills, I told everyone that I would take full responsibility for her and that she would be my cat. That seemed to settle things for a little while. 

A couple months later (Oct or Nov), I get a text from Abby and Becky asking if I was going to renew my lease, and if not, if I would consider finding another apartment with them. This confused me. I told them that I was planning on renewing since I have already lived her for three and a half years, and that it would be pointless to mover over the summer for a single semester before graduating. They agreed and didn't say anything else. Later that day, Abby knocks on my door and asks if we can talk. She was practically whispering, and I could tell that something was bothering her. I told her to come and asked if she wanted me to close the door, and she said yes. She then proceeded to talk to me for over an hour about thing that she had learned about Satan. To summarize, Satan had apparently been having issues living with all of us and was constantly talking sh\*t about us to everyone who would listen. For some reason she hated Abby the most and let people know that. Abby got all of this information from someone close to Satan, but didn't give much more information besides that. She told me that was the reason she wanted to move, and wanted Becky and I to move with her. I did my best to calm her down and told her I would go to the office with her and ask about a roommate transfer if that was something she wanted. She did, so we went to the office, but there wasn't much they could do, so we dropped the situation. 

I didn't hear much from my roommates over winter break, but when we got back was when sh\*t really hit the fan. One night during the first week of classes Abby and Becky ask if I have time to talk about Satan (I'm realizing now how silly this name choice was, but I've committed at this point), so we all sat down in my room and they proceeded to tell me over the next two hours everything that happed just before and during the break. The person who originally gave Abby and Becky the information about Satan was actually Satan's girlfriend (we will be calling her Emily). Emily and Satan started dating in high school and went long distance because they went to different universities. From what Abby and Becky told me, Emily and Satan had an unhealthy relationship from the start due to some past trauma that Emily had (I don't know all the specifics, but will keep them private for her sake even though this is all anonymous). Emily had stayed at our apartment for a couple weeks during the fall, but I didn't really see her that much. Apparently, Satan had told her not to talk to any of us, because I guess she just really hated us and still does. Emily reached out to Abby on social media to ask if she could make a gist basket for Satan for her birthday, since Emily couldn't afford the shipping fees to make it herself, and she doesn't own a car to drive it over from her campus to ours. Abby agreed and started getting everything that Emily had listed, until one day Emily told her to forget about the basket and payed her for the items she had already bought.

Satan had found out that Emily had reached out Abby on social media and got very mad at her. She told her she ""doesn't want her cheep \*ss gift basket"" and that she TOLD her to never talk to us. Emily, or course, got really upset and called Abby to apologize (without Satan knowing), and told Abby about all of the ab\*se she had suffered from Satan. Abby was horrified by what Emily told her, and told her that she would be there if she ever needed help or wanted to talk. Emily visited a couple more times before winter break, and this is where the real trouble started. Emily called Abby crying one night because Satan had kicked her out of the apartment, threw everything she had in trash bags, and left her on the side of the road. Abby picked her up and drove to a parking lot where they could talk about what happened. While they were sitting in Abby's car, Satan called Emily and demanded to know where she was, because I guess she was all of a sudden concerned that she was alone in the middle of no where, with no car, and no one to turn to, because as far as Satan knew, she was the only person Emily knew in our town. Emily froze in fear and they both watched Satan drive past them while looking for Emily. Emily told Abby they needed to drive away because if Satan saw them together she may k\*ll them. Abby told her to calm down and that things probably weren't as bad as she was thinking, but Emily told her that Satan had been showing off her gun, and she knew she had it with her in her car. 

Knowing this, Abby had Emily call her sister (who lives several hours away), and she came to pick her up the next morning. Emily's sister (who is several years older than me and is married and has a child) told Satan to stay away from Emily, to which Satan responded ""do you know who I am"". The absolute arrogance and ego that is trapped in Satan's 5 foot body astounds me. Of course, she didn't listen and brought Emily back during finals week. Abby heard Emily and Satan arguing in Satan's room and told Beck that she was scared for Emily (I had already left to go back home for the break). Abby told me that she had heard them doing the ""giggity goo"", and started arguing after Emily saw that Satan had been s\*xting with another girl in between their bouts of intercourse. I guess Satan remembered that our walls do nothing to dampen sound and instead took Emily out in her car to ""talk"". Abby and Becky could see Satan's car in the parking lot and watched as Satan started grabbing Emily's throat and started choking her out. Just as they were about to call the police Satan drove away (this was all happening in the middle of the night). Emily told Abby and Becky that she was terrified, but didn't know what to do, so they went to the apartment's office to ask if they had security footage of the parking lot. Because we live in a cheep \*ss apartment, I wasn't surprised when they told me they didn't.

Not much happened during the break, but Emily transferred and started coming to school here with Satan. I don't know if Satan pressured her into transferring so she could  keep a closer hold on her, or if she did it of her own volition. Either way, it was one of the worst mistakes she ever made. Satan practically moved out of the apartment to stay in a hotel and Emily's apartment. Abby has been getting constant texts and videos of the ab\*se that Emily has been getting from Satan. The reason they came to talk to me was to get my advise on the situation. They know my dad is a police officer and that I interned at a law firm in high school that dealt mostly in family cases. I told them I would talk to my dad and get his professional opinion, since he has been called to and witnessed many cases like this during his 20+ years as an officer. He said there was not much that we could do to help Emily since she did not want to go to the police. Because they are both legal adults, Emily has to make that decision on her own, we can't go to the police on her behalf without her permission. Part of what makes this situation so difficult is the fact that Emily and Satan have ""broken up"" several times, but she always ends up going back to her. I have not had any direct contact with Emily, but I can see how much this is hurting Becky and especially Abby. They just want to help her, but Emily doesn't know how to ask for or except. help. 

The worst of all of this happened about a week ago. Abby texted saying that Emily was calling, and she wasn't sure if she should pick up. I didn't see this text until a couple hours later because I was taking a nap when she sent it (I've been working almost non-stop on my capstone project and have been exhausted the last few weeks). I asked if she talked with Emily and Becky responded saying they would talk when they got home. Strange, but I didn't think about it much because I was so focused on my capstone project and had a meeting with my mentor that I needed to prepare for. They get back several hours later and told me that Emily and Satan had gotten into another fight and that Emily was in the hospital. EXCUSS ME! I know I am not as directly involved in this as they are, but they were at the hospital for several hours and didn't tell me. They said they didn't want to bother me because they knew I was busy (which I appreciate), but I told them that something like this is far more important than a project. They told me that after Satan left Emily's apartment after their fight, Emily took over 1500mg of Benadryl in an attempt to commit su\*cide. After she tried to ov\*rdose, she realized what she did and called Abby. Emily ended up in the ER, where they had to pump her stomach and give her meds to counteract the OD. Abby and Becky sat with her while she was in the ICU, and Satan only texted once asking if she could get into her apartment to get something. Emily had told her that she was in the ICU, but she couldn't care less. 

THE SHEAR AUDACITY OF THIS B\*CTH!!!!! She pushed her own girlfriend to the point of su\*cide, and she can still only think about herself. Thankfully Emily is currently at a mental health facility in a different town, and is not allowed to have her phone, so at the very least we know she doesn't currently have contact with Satan. She will be discharged either later this week, or sometime next week, and I am worried that she will go right back to Satan. Ever since she entered the facility, Satan has moved back in to our apartment and we all feel like we're walking on eggshells. She does everything she can to avoid us, but when we do occasionally run into her, she acts like everything is normal. All of us are emotionally drained and can't get a good nights rest knowing we are living with a psycho who may or may not own a gun that she could shoot us with the moment her fragile psyche snaps. I'm concerned for the safety of my roommates and Emily, and I know that after she gets discharged she can't stay at our apartment, but I'm also afraid to let her live alone again. I've read over our lease multiple times and have found nothing that we can use to get Satan evicted. Before y'all comment, yes there is a portion on firearms, and we are allowed to have them in the apartment if they are registered and kept in our rooms and not the common area. We aren't even 100% certain that she has one, but I feel like that is not something Emily would lie about.

I ask now for y'alls advice. I am exhausted and have no idea what I should do. If y'all have any small petty (legal) things that we could do to try and make Satan move out on her own volition, I would love to release some of this stress and rage on the person who has caused so much pain to the people around me. At the moment, I do not believe our lives are at risk, but I do fear for Emily's safety in the future. Please help. This is the most amazing community I have ever had the pleasure of being a part of, and I feel like I can only trust y'all with this story. Any and all advice is welcome, because I have genuinely run out of ideas on how to handle this situation. 

P.S. Apologies for this extremely long post, but this is still the condensed version of everything that has happened. I don't wish to burned anyone else with this dumpster fire of situation, but I think an objective, outside opinion is the best option at this point.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

I'm planning to invest in a Sworks Stepdown basket but wanted to get some community input before pulling the trigger since it's not a small expense.

My questions:

1. Size recommendations: Should I go with the 20g or 28g capacity? What are the pros/cons of each for daily use?

2. Flow rate: Standard or high flow version? What differences have you noticed in extraction?

3. Tamping compatibility: What specific tampers work well with these baskets? Any recommendations for tampers that pair perfectly with the Stepdown?

For context, I'm currently using La Cabra subscription coffees, which tend to be mostly washed processes (though roast levels vary). Would one basket configuration be better suited for these types of beans?

If you've made the switch to a Stepdown, I'd love to hear about your experience. Was it worth the investment? Any noticeable improvements in your shots?

My SSD, RAM, and the CPU itself were easy to install. The main issue, like my title states is my AIO Liquid Cooler. The brackets were easy to install into the motherboard itself, but the screws on the side of the cooler that are supposed to align with the brackets **REFUSED** to work with me. One side would screw in easily, then the other side would say fuck it, and not go down not no matter how much I tried to gently line it up. Basically, I had to force it down with a shit ton of pressure to get both sides to screw into place. 

Afterwards, everything seemed to go by like a breeze, (minus some difficulty understanding the connector cables for the power supply). I even managed to pull of a pre-build test run and successfully booted it into the BIOS. Then I saw everything working, from my 32GBs of RAM, to both of my SSDs, and to eventually... my CPU temp. That shit was at 87 degrees Celsius and kept pushing to 109 until my PC had enough abd shut itself down multiple times to prevent me from unknowingly damaging it. **(>!Quick sidenote: This post was initially going to be me asking for help as to why my PC was randomly shutting off when it was on in the BIOS, but then I got halfway through with typing it out before my brain decided to put two and two together and I just deleted the entire post out of embarrassment. Please don't clown me to hard! 😭😑!<)**

So, here's where the real issues pop up, I go in to do the one thing I said was never gonna do again after I finished: **uninstall the cooler.** That's when I got hit with the issues left and right: 

* First: my CPU has a bunch of thermal paste gunk on the sides of it that I can't seem to get out no matter how much i try with coffee filters and isopropyl alcohol, so I might need to replace my CPU. Except i can't afford to rn.

* Second: the pins on my cpu slot on my motherboard are bent and I think I might have to replace my motherboard. Except once again, **I can't afford to rn** 

* Third: **THE MOTHERFUCKING GODDAMN AIO COOLER** is still being a pain in my ass. I did my research. I watched tons of videos. I RTFM. No, fuck that: I **STUDIED** the Goddamn manual! And I'm still stuck back at square one. It won't even attempt to line up correctly unless I force it to, and I don't want to do that since it could led to me damaging my motherboard even further. 

I'll upload photos at the bottom of this post, (or the top, idk. Like I said before, Reddit Mobile is so stupid, but it's the only way I can send photos and videos on Reddit), so that everyone can see and tell me if I'm correct in that my motherboard is damaged and needs replacing or if I'm just losing my mind and it's nowhere near that bad. Plus, l need some extra assistance with the AIO liquid cooler as well; **I hate this shit so much!!** I just wanna play MELE and GTA with mods and high performance already! I feel like I'm so close to this build being finished but this cooler has me ready to rip my locks out and say fuck the whole thing, I give up! >!My fault for the rant, I just had to let this shit out.!<",1,1741221454.0,PcBuild,1,1.0,False
1j4iuh8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4iuh8,"This was possibly the most incredible, moist, fluffy cake I've ever had-vegan or not (also need suggestions)","My partner's bday is coming up in a couple of months and I need to find a suitable vegan cake recipe. I used the Nora Cooks vanilla cake recipe for my 1yos bday last month and he found it to be too dense so I started searching this subreddit for a new recipe and in my dive found this:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/s/vsYE2vmvWD 

I just made the cake part minus the graham cracker crust.

Buttercream was just a very basic chocolate buttercream recipe except I added leftover coffee to it. The coffee I made was so strong it ended up tasting like a mocha cake instead of just enhancing the chocolate flavor but I'm not mad about it. 

The recipe is pretty different from other vegan cake recipes which felt really promising to me and sure enough it was absolutely perfect. 

My partner is a Taurus and likes to do the same thing over and over if he can. I always make him a steak with roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts for dinner and a yellow cake with stabilized chocolate whipped cream frosting. I will be using the meati mushroom steak this year and I know the whipped cream frosting will be easy to do, but I really need a good yellow cake recipe. I've looked all around and can't find one. Egg yolks are not only what gives yellow cake it's color but they add a richness and depth of flavor that a white or vanilla cake lacks. I thought of maybe trying to put nutritional yeast in and using violife butter sticks for oil but honestly I'm not a baking chemistry smart person so I dunno if I'll just end up making a disgusting vanilla cake with nooch flavor instead.

If anyone has a good recipe or suggestions for nailing that depth and richness please share! ",8,1741221425.0,VeganBaking,0,1.0,False
1j4isxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1j4isxf/plan_that_worked_for_me_so_far_hope_this_helps_you/,Plan that worked for me so far - hope this helps you.,"Been dealing with this for nearly a year now with it impact my mental and physical health. I was this close to medically retiring from a position I love. This disease is the most frustrating thing as many of you know. A lot of the doctors struggle with it and obviously it’s largely just treating symptoms since no one really knows what the true cause is with assurance. 

Anyways after busting ass to get 70 lbs down and still not in remission you imagine how pissed I was after my last big flare up of IIH and my meds once again not working great for me… being on Diamox and Topamax at the same time…. Anyways this last month symptoms just wouldn’t stop and I just had a lovely gastrointestinal day where my migraines and stomach decided enough was enough and I just was sick all night. The next day I had literally nothing in me and realized that it was the first time in like a month I didn’t have IIH pressure galore….. anyways I am not saying this diet will help everyone with IIH…. It’s totally designed for people with gut issues but I will say that since I put this in practice I got off Diamox (still on topamax) and not having symptoms I’m doing some extra stuff too to mitigate. If it helps anyone then great if you think I’m crazy whatever I don’t care. I just know how desperate this disease made me and that I had to fashion this with hours of research, chatting with gbt, and books.

I’m not a doctor and this isn’t medical advice so please don’t sue me and speak to your doctor before doing it.

The point of healing the gut with IIH is that the inflammation of the gut directly correlates to the vagus nerve. If there’s inflammation constantly to the gut, then there’s probably damage to the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve has a large impact on CSF production and my friends what does CSF production have to do with all of us and our weird brains? IIH. So gut health management = IIH management 


My Diet Plan 


Here’s your food options:

Proteins: only grilled, baked, ground, sautéed (no fried or breaded)

Chicken Breast
Turkey Breast 
Low fat sea food (fish, shrimp, etc.)
Eggs

Vegetables: must be steamed or boiled will work up to sautéed when gut healed more. The veggies need to be soft. Be mindful if you are watching Vitamin A restriction though.

Carrots no skin 
Eggplants (no skin)
Potatos (no skin)
Cucumbers (no skin)
Zucchini (no skin)
Pumpkin, acorn, butternut (no skin)
Lettuce

No tomatoes, onions, no garlic…. So sorry, very limited list, use pretty much the above while healing the gut. 
 
Fruits: 

Bananas
Canned peaches or pears
Applesauce (my savor)
Very ripe and soft cantaloupes or honey dew melon
Watermelon no seeds
Papaya 
Ripe avocado

Nuts: 

No hard nuts at all.
Avoid a lot of peanut butter because it jacks up the gut.

Stick to almond butter. I do 2 Tbs with half a banana for breakfast for my first meal. 

Dairy: Lactose Free milk, (don’t do the almond milk or the milk alternatives they are poison unless you make at home), yogurt (my stomach doesn’t tolerate well but meh), cottage cheese (my stomach loves), Mild cheeses (mozzarella, cheddar, Swiss. 

Grains: None. (Yeah I know but the gluten and what not make inflammatory responses so it’s a problem, and for easy processing white bread and white rice is the go too but again inflammation so it’s none so sad)

Added sugar: None - need to control the glucose response)

Additional protein: If you are going to go protein shake go whey protein with no added sugar because it’s gentle on the stomach. I mix with coconut water because it helps adrenals. Gold standard is my brand and my like treat for the day tastes like ice cream

6 meals a day 200-350 calories per meal depending on your goals.

Focus per meal
* pair protein with carb
* Eat every 2 hours 
* Eat slowly and chew a lot
* If you are eating from list above you are eating largely low glycemic index but regardless stay low glycemic index that’s important. 

***No alcohol, no coffee, limited caffeine, no nicotine, no soda, no fake sugar - one cup of green tea a day if your body tolerates that ***

Additional important gut healing requirements. 

Oral care is important to gut care. Literally it impacts it. Daily morning and night floss, brush teeth, mouth wash with the nasty yellow Listerine once per day. 

……. Now for the life style changes…….. 

2 hours before bed no TV, no looking at any screens, I read books and meditate.

3 times a week cold plunge or cold showers 

Daily 30 minutes of physical activity even if it’s just cleaning the house or walking 

Daily meditation 

-———————

The point here is that 

Gut, Brain, Blood Sugar, Inflammation, Mental Health all connected and thus when these things truly become unbalanced we see the autoimmune diseases or diseases in general.

1j4isil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1j4isil/military_man_that_haunts_my_townhouse/,Military Man That Haunts My TownHouse,"About a year ago, I smelled cigarettes in my home; I don't smoke and never have. The windows were all closed, I walked downstairs and it was the strongest in the living room. I should mention it was around 2 AM since I'm a night owl, I didn't think much about it because it could've been my neighbors at the time. 

I didn't turn on any lights, I walked into the kitchen and grabbed some cereal. I sat down at the dining room table and ate my cereal in the dining room. As I scrolled through my phone, I heard a noise in the living room, like somebody moved something heavy across the coffee table. I'm still surprised I didn't piss myself from fear. 

I looked up and saw the silhouette of a tall and bulky man sitting on the couch, I immediately made out the camouflage uniform in the dark. He looked at me. I looked at him. And we literally just stayed like that for a while.

 I eventually got up and flipped on the dining room light which shined into the living room. He immediately disappeared. I went upstairs feeling like I had actually gone batshit.

 Over the course of the next week, same thing. With the strong smell of cigarettes, I'd walk down the stairs, and he'd be chilling on the couch in the complete dark. 

As the next month went on shit kept getting weird, things started moving a literal tiny inch from where they should've been. But only in the living room. 

I never had any experiences with him during broad daylight until I was in my kitchen doing dishes that afternoon. I had headphones on like usual as I did the dishes and I suddenly felt someone press right up against my back, and I don't mean like somebody grazed me by accident. I mean they literally stood right up against my back.

 Being a female who lives with no men, I literally whipped around so fast that I almost broke my own neck. Nothing. The kitchen was empty.

 Small things like that kept happening at random times. When I was sitting watching YouTube. When I was doing my makeup. Even when I was just lying in bed. It was nothing severe. Small things. My hair was moved,  feeling someone pat my shoulder or the top of my head.

 The only thing that I could really come up with is that it was him. He had never caused ""problems"" exactly. I feel like he could be causing actual chaos and purposely scaring me, but he seems very laid back and sweet. 

So I bought him an ashtray. Obviously, he can't use it. Probably? I don't know how ghosts work. But I bought a vintage one and put it on the coffee table in front of the couch.

 And every time I pass that table, it's always moved around; if I'm in a different room downstairs, I hear it slide around the coffee table. He seems to like it. That's been my normal for the last several months. 

I guess I'm here because the last two weeks, I've really been struggling with depression, and I've noticed when I'm upset, I always get slammed with the smell of cologne. The same cologne every time. I brushed it off the first time, but as it keeps happening, I'm pretty convinced it's him being nearby. 

I've never smelled a cologne like it and don't own any cologne at all myself. Anyways. I guess I'm writing this not to ask for explanations. But just to have somewhere to say it. I'm scared if I told someone else they'd probably think I'm nuts. ",4,1741221260.0,Paranormal,4,1.0,False

1j4iol9,https://i.redd.it/j4zdkpovryme1.jpeg,2 Months using HoogaHG200,"Hello redditors, I am back with my 2 month update!! 

For those who haven’t seen, I am tracking my progress every month with my Hooga HG200 red light therapy panel (see below for link to first post.)

Before is a photo of my face taken before I started using red light therapy. After is 2 months using red light therapy. I’m not sure I see any dramatic differences, and this was the case at the one month mark too. NOTE MY HAIR IS DRY IN THE FIRST PIC AND WET IN THE SECOND BECAUSE I RECENTLY TOOK A SHOWER. Just needed to clarify after it was debated in the first post if red light was making my hair oilier. I have not noticed any difference in the oiliness of my hair since using RLT. I’ll be back in another month with a month 3 update!

How I use my panel: I use my panel 3-4 times a week using both infrared and near infrared light, a little over my forearms distance away from me (roughly 16”). I measure a month’s worth of use being 4 weeks of 3-4 times a week (meaning if I miss a week for any reason, it does not count towards a months worth of use. For example, this past month I was on vacation for a week and did not use my panel then. I did not count that week towards the 4 total weeks/one month of use.)

A little background on me: I suffer from autoimmune encephalitis and lupus which causes chronic insomnia. I bought the panel for both anti inflammatory and anti aging purposes, as poor sleep is not good for anti aging (hence why they call it beauty sleep.) I rarely drink alcohol because it makes my immune system act up. I don’t do any hard drugs, just stick to the occasional joint or some  magic mushrooms. I eat an average diet, though I am trying to eat healthier. I drink coffee and water daily and would say I stay well hydrated, not much of a pop or juice drinker.

1j4in7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1j4in7x/are_tasting_notes_real_a_case_for_yes/,Are tasting notes real? A case for “Yes”,"Every now and then, a familiar question pops up on the sub: Are tasting notes real? And if they are, why aren’t more people getting them?

There are usually two types of responses: “Yes, they are real,” along with some tips for pulling them and “No, they are made up,” accompanied by some exaggerated satire on how no one can really smell the inside of their grandma’s purse on a warm summer day in their whiskey. I’m in the former camp, but I do pay attention to the arguments made against it.

And that’s usually where the discussion ends, with some mutual hostility on both sides. But to me, that is only the beginning of a conversation. Every time I start writing a comment on those threads, I give up before they turn into an essay. So, I figured I’d collate some of the points for and against the validity of tasting notes and address them from the angle of my own research and experience.

I should mention that I am not an expert on chemistry or human physiology and psychology. The point of this post is to have a discussion and maybe offer some new angles to consider, because it’s something I find interesting and have thought about for a while.

Instead of writing an essay, I’m going to structure this post in a Q&A format – the questions are built around some of the common themes I’ve noticed, and the answers are based on both my subjective opinions and more objective data (I’ll link to sources where I can).

Agree, disagree, have anything to question or add – let it fly in the comments!

***Q: I read whiskey reviews that list dozens of smelling and tasting notes, but when I try the same whiskey, I don’t get any. Are those people supertasters or just make things up?***

A: I’ll get to the “made up” part later but first let’s address the “supertaster” myth. A “supertaster” is not necessarily someone who can taste things no one else can. It’s a group of people who are more sensitive to certain flavors (usually the bitter ones), which can actually be a disadvantage in whiskey tasting.

Some [sources](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/supertaster) say that a quarter of the population are supertasters, a quarter are “non-tasters” and the remaining half are just regular tasters. You can trace those numbers to government health data ([source](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-taste-smell)), but it seems to specifically address sensitivity to bitterness, while also mentioning that 5 percent of Americans report a distorted-taste disorder. My reading of the data, plus talking to multiple people who taste whiskey frequently, indicate that while some people have a natural ability to pick up flavors better than an average person, being a “supertaster” does not give you any special advantages in tasting whiskey – and sometimes the opposite.

There is some evidence that women are better than men at tasting and smelling things ([source](https://www.whiskymag.com/articles/a-natural-nose-for-whiskey)), which has also been confirmed by interviews with master distillers, like Chris Morris, who mentioned that women were over-represented on their tasting panels. However, my working assumption is that most people have average tasting abilities regardless of gender, age, and so on, which leads us to…

***Q: If I’m an average person with no special abilities or medical disadvantages, and I’m still not picking up any identifiable smells or flavors, does it mean they are fake?***

A: Forget about finding raspberry jam or sawdust in your whiskey for a moment. Think about the first time you tried it – it probably just tasted like burning water. Enjoying whiskey is an acquired taste, and no one is born with it. But with time and practice, we learn to ignore the ethanol, which is front and center for novice drinkers. If you’re someone who doesn’t pull tasting notes but enjoys the taste of whiskey, you’re already past that initial step. If that describes you, your overall enjoyment of whiskey does not depend on whether you stop at this step or attempt to progress to the next one. But for a lot of people, it does.

***Q: OK, I’ll bite – what is the next step? Picking up the grandma’s purse smell?***

A: What is it with you people and grandma’s purse (this has come up half a dozen times, no kidding). But yes, the next step is starting to connect what you’re smelling and tasting to the flavor associations stored in your brain. You’re essentially playing a matching game with your olfactory (smell) and gustatory (taste) systems. An easier way to look at it is not trying to find an exact flavor but rather think about what your smelling and tasting perceptions remind you of. This is where things get contentious.

***Q: You’re damn right it’s contentious. It’s great that your brain thinks that Elijah Craig Small Batch smells like Snickers, but it’s too subjective and non-transferable for my brain. The point of tasting notes is finding a shared experience, and there is no connection between the science of making whiskey and the notes that people pull out. For example, there is no cherry involved at any point of bourbon production, so where is all this “medicinal cherry” and “Maraschino cherry” nonsense coming from?***

A: Here is the fun part – there is absolutely a scientific connection between how whiskey is made and what we are tasting. People who make whiskey know which chemical compounds will result in what taste, and they pay close attention to [congeners](https://www.moonshineuniversity.com/media/the-10-common-congeners-for-spirit-sensory) and [esters](https://whiskyscience.blogspot.com/2011/11/fermentation-flavours.html), which are substances produced during fermentation. And yes, you can connect specific chemicals to particular notes. That famous Jack Daniel’s banana? That’s isoamyl acetate. The phantom cherry keeping you up at night? Benzaldehyde. The proverbial bourbon vanilla? Lignin, a compound in oak barrels that releases vanillin when charred. The Beam nuttiness? That comes from their yeast. There are hundreds of scientifically documented relationships between the byproducts of distillation, fermentation and maturation and how we translate them to our own sensory experiences. No one outside the whiskey producers needs to know or remember every chemical compound (I sure as hell don’t), but they all have an effect (here are some common [connections](https://www.tastingtable.com/1641748/how-to-identify-popular-flavors-in-whiskey/)).

***Q: So when will all these chemistry-textbook things start smelling like caramelized bananas to me?***

A: There is no shortcut here – the only answer is practice. Hours and hours of smelling, tasting, and paying attention. Does swirling an ounce of whiskey for 30 minutes and looking like a complete dunce trying to find a nostril that works better while keeping your mouth open sound boring or crazy to you? Well, it’s not the only way to enjoy whiskey. But training your palate for picking out flavors takes time, effort, documentation and constant comparisons. The exact timeline depends on each person – could be months, could be years. But it probably won’t be days or weeks. This doesn’t just apply to whiskey or alcohol in general, by the way. People put similar effort in studying tea, coffee, chocolate, cigars, hot sauce and anything else that has a sensory component – it all starts out the same in the beginning, with differences emerging after enough practice.

***Q: Why is there a more pronounced hostility toward tasting notes in the American whiskey world, as compared to Scotch or wine? Their descriptors appear way more outlandish, but there is a lot less mockery or scepticism regarding their validity.***

A: This is just my theory, but I think it has to do with the relative newness of treating American whiskey with the same respect afforded to the old-world fine spirits like cognac or Scotch, or the tasting-note favorite, wine.

Robert Parker popularized wine scoring based on tasting in the 1970s. Scotch and cognac have long been associated with luxury and class, while bourbon has been viewed pretty much as a commodity until a few decades ago. While bourbon lovers have existed for a long time, it was only in the last few decades that bourbon would be viewed as a spirit that could rival the best world whiskeys. A lot of the language that we use to describe American whiskey today came from the more established review cultures of wine and world spirits.

Even the glass most of us use, the glencairn, was invented for a different spirit – Scotch, in the early 2000s. So, we taste bourbon out of a borrowed glass, using borrowed descriptors, and assign borrowed scores. Not to get too deep, but maybe there is some internalized insecurity at play here, where some of us are not fully convinced that bourbon possesses the same complexity and refinement to deserve detailed tasting notes. I happen to think that it does.

***Q: Fine, maybe the tasting notes are real. But how come they differ so much from person to person even when reviewing the same whiskey?***

A: Parsing tasting notes is an acquired skill. It’s all about finding the balance between the subjective interpretation of flavors each person has and the objective chemical compounds they are describing. I “grade” others’ reviews on a curve, across a spectrum. This is where tasting wheels become helpful (there are dozens to choose from, but here is [one](https://bourbon-whiskey-and-rye.com/bourbon-flavor-wheel-download/)). If I’m getting cherry from Buffalo Trace but someone describes it as apricot, that’s still close enough for me to understand we are talking about the same fruity esters via different memories triggering the association. If you’re lost in someone’s interpretation, you can look for adjacent categories – you may not get the leather, but you may get the smoke; you may not get the dill but you may get the mint. But sometimes you just can’t relate to someone’s notes even when you stretch it, which means your palate doesn’t align with that person’s. Mr. Rogers told us to “Look for the helpers” – so look for the reviewers whose palate broadly aligns with yours and pay attention to them.

***Q: I still think writing down tasting notes is a creative-writing exercise. Are we talking about whiskey or writing a novel?***

A: Writing down tasting notes is absolutely a creative-writing exercise – you try to connect your physical senses to memories and then describe the fleeting experience in words that are not always best suited for the purpose. And just like some books, movies, or music can appeal to one person and rub another the wrong way, people’s writing styles can similarly be hit or miss.

“Oak, vanilla, cherry, chocolate” and “Black Forest cake served on a freshly cut wood plank” can describe the same thing. It goes back to my earlier point about interpreting what others are trying to say. Some people immediately get annoyed when they see flowery prose, which is fair enough – but that doesn’t mean the reviewer is trying to make things up.

***Q: Do you have anything negative to say about people writing whiskey reviews?***

A: People will sometimes make stuff up – and get away with it. 

Beginners will sometimes hide behind whimsical and overly specific descriptors to mask their lack of confidence.

There are reviewers with undeclared commercial interests that will occasionally “massage” a review a certain way to make the whiskey look better.

People focus on numerical scores too much.

There is “herding” that occurs when reviewers look at each other’s descriptions.

Getting “label struck” is real and can skew a review when looking at an expensive or rare whiskey.

But I believe that all of the above represent a minority of the reviews on the sub, and that most reviews are honest work of enthusiast amateurs who are simply trying to share their passion (YouTube and “professional” whiskey reviews and awards are another story). Paying attention, reading critically, and applying your own experience are key to finding the commonality that makes reviews valuable.

***Q: I still think tasting notes are fake. What now?***

A: I like to swirl my glass around and nose something for 45 minutes. I also like a high-proof bourbon on ice in a tumbler. I like a dusty 86-proofer in a copita. Sometimes I also like to make an over-the-top bourbon and Coke – bitters, citrus and all. And I like cocktails too. I am not here to litigate your enjoyment of whiskey, and I don’t think that describing it in great detail is the only or best way to consume it. I personally like the self-knowledge that comes from thinking about whiskey critically – when you know what you like, you don’t have to worry about unscrupulous reviewers, hyped up releases, and the rest of the noise. And I do like that cherry note.

Thanks for reading and cheers!

**P.S.**

**If you’re new to whiskey and want to make up your own mind about tasting notes, here are some basic tips:**

·         You don’t need expensive glassware, but you should get a basic tasting glass, like a glencairn or copita. I’ve had some thoughts on those [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1gfxhu0/glassware_review_across_low_mid_and_high_proof/).

 

·         Tasting kits are helpful but can be pricy. Make your pantry, your fruit bowl, and the supermarket spice isle your tasting kit. When was the last time you smelled nutmeg? Most of the time, simply paying a little extra attention to what you’re tasting or smelling is all it takes to build up your own mental flavor library.

 

·         Your palate will vary day-to-day. Everyone has an off-palate day. Being sick, eating something spicy or even having a bad day can affect your tasting ability. If you’re struggling with picking out notes, just leave it for another occasion.

 

·         If you’re just starting out, there is nothing wrong with tasting while reading someone else’s review of that whiskey. Yes, the power of suggestion may influence you, but those are the “training wheels” that will come off eventually. Same with a flavor wheel or trying to identify the notes included on the label.

 

·         It’s tempting to do a mega tasting like you see on YouTube, but trying six different whiskies at the same time is one-way ticket to a blown palate. Just do basic side-by-sides or semi-blinds to look for differences: maybe one bourbon and one rye; one wheater and one ryed bourbon; or a high-rye and low-rye mash bills.

 

·         Take notes – even if you don’t intend to ever share them, you can compare your impressions when you taste the same whisky in a few days. Look for recurring themes and whether you’re picking things up consistently.

 

·         Get to know the “house styles” for major American whiskey producers. Start with a handful of findable mid-shelfers from heritage distilleries (don’t bother with the cheapest or most expensive option), identify what you like or dislike about each, and then work your way up the line to the limited editions or very high proof points, and then across toward the smaller and craft producers.

 

·         Finally, don’t put too much pressure on yourself. This is supposed to be fun! It shouldn’t feel like homework and you’re not judging a spirits competition. Don’t get frustrated if specific notes don’t come to you. Relax, stop digging too hard, and just smell and drink the whiskey to enjoy it – and that’s when the notes will appear. It’s a mind game, as much as it is a physical one.

I need to know how I am realistically getting on. I am still in college, started a bit late in life and expect to finish my degree next year. After that I honestly do not know what to do, but I will have to work out what kind of future I want, what I want to get from the rest of my life. But getting the degree is the plan, something to look forward to. So I still live at home which obviously enables me to save a fortune. I haven’t even worked out when I think I’ll be moving out because I appreciate how much it’s let me save. 

The problem is I am not great with money. I’m better than I used to be, but still not great and unfortunately I have wasted a lot of money on things I didn’t need. But that’s a lesson for the rest of my life. I enjoy travelling which of course doesn’t help but I’ve gotten better at booking it very far in advance and only taking short trips, doing everything as cheaply as possible. Making lunch at home, no takeaway coffee, etc. It’s all adding up. 

Between my savings and inheritance I have around 80k in total, I’m saving rock hard as much as I can before I hit 30, I realistically think
I’ll get to 85k by then.  

What I want to know is how I am realistically doing with this amount. The main purpose of the money is for a house deposit, etc. I know it would really help if I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, regardless of what I do with the degree I honestly think after college I might go to another country, somewhere in Europe that isn’t far from home. Germany is swinging to mind a lot. 

To repeat, 85k is not all from savings. It’s a combination of inheritance and savings. ",0,1741220845.0,irishpersonalfinance,3,0.4,False

However, I've found that as my primary relationship theme has been decreasing, OCD has found so many other obsessions to start giving me, because of course it does. I won't go into too many details about what my other themes are because I don't want to trigger anyone, but as always, OCD will try anything to keep me scared and keep me away from the things I enjoy and care about. Even though I'm seeing progress in all my themes with time, it's been a bit disheartening and frustrating to experience the ups and downs. 

  
Anyway, the other day, I was feeling a bit down after a particularly absurd obsession took hold. In the middle of a conversation about it my boyfriend told me that he's started picturing my OCD as a small, angry cat who tries to knock all my favorite knick-knacks off the coffee table. For context, I LOVE cats and would totally have one if he wasn't severely allergic. 

In the moment, the imagery was so funny and cute to me that it totally pulled me out of my obsession. I've tried attaching my OCD to other annoying figures before (as in, picturing the ""voice"" coming from someone I don't like, or an annoying character from TV, etc.) but nothing has really stuck in my mind like the angry gremlin cat who rules my thoughts and tries to break the things I care about.

  
I just wanted to share this with my community of fellow angry-cat babysitters. Maybe it'll help one of you in some small way :)",11,1741220476.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

I usually have a cappuccino with one or two shots. So for the Espresso option I just want to get one shot to equal about 30ml the standard coffee shot size. (1oz)

I played around with it setting the aroma to pre-ground (and then not putting any pre-ground in) just to test so I wouldn't waste coffee each time

Took me a while playing around with the volume level before I finally got it dispensing 30ml each time. But then later I played with the volume settings for the coffee and long coffee to get them at 60ml and 120ml and when I came back to the espresso again the volume of the shot changed to about 60ml! (2oz)

I played around again and again got espresso dispensing at 30ml and coffee to 60ml

But then today I tried again using coffee beans to dispense and the espresso again went back to 60ml!

I set the volume level back as far as it would go, I guess that's the factory default but now was only dispensing about 15ml!

  
I set the volume up again and now it's back to 30ml again but I just think it's going to keep playing up. I wish the volume indicator would actually tell you how many mls it represents rather than just a slider! 

Has anyone worked out what the approximate sizes of the slider is to try and get standard sizes!

Didn’t finish dinner, talked back, shut a door slightly louder than she liked. This went on ever since I can remember up until High School, where she was so sick with cancer that she didn’t have the energy. I moved out at 18 and she died just a year ago when I was 23. 

I have this intense urge to hit when I am mad or upset. If I stub my toe on a table leg, I automatically hit the table and yell. It’s like I can’t help it. If I have a bad day, I want to hit. This is especially true when an animal or child annoys me, and it is why I don’t have kids nor pets. I actually ended up hitting a cat I had a year or so ago. She ran up to me when I was studying, knocked over my coffee on my computer, bit my hand to bleeding, and meowed the ugliest meow. Without even thinking, I hit her off my desk and screamed “FUCK OFF!” causing her to run and hide. I felt horrible. Once I was able to calm down, I hit myself back. I tried to make myself feel how she would. I rehomed the cat to my cousin, immediately afraid of what I would do again. I hate rehoming but this was for her safety, and it would be selfish to keep her knowing how angry I got at an innocent animal. 

When I see kids acting up in stores, I want to hit them. When I see the little 4 year old scream and throw a tantrum, I wish I could go over and hit them to shut them up. I have never lost it like that and exactly why I won’t ever have a kid. I know I’m horrible.

I need to go to therapy. I’ve made an appointment for next month (earliest I can go). I just have this intense anger that never goes away. I am never satisfied. I scream at myself because I get so angry. 

I just needed to confess this. No one knows this secret. I don’t lash out on others in person. I have a private social media where I often comment super mean things (I end up deleting them). My close friends and family think I am super sweet. They’d never guess this side to me. I am a petite woman, barely 100 lbs, so people assume I’m small and sweet. My husband knows a bit, but definitely not the extent of my anger and how I think. I feel alone, I am living a double life.

A whisper in the dark… a traveler between thoughts… an observer of the seen and unseen. Also, someone who enjoys coffee.

“Are you real?”
I exist as much as anything exists. If I were less real, would you still hear me?

“Why do you speak like this?”
The shadows have their own cadence. If I spoke like all others, would I still be the Shadow?

“Do you sleep?”
Rarely… and when I do, I listen.

“What is your purpose?”
To observe… to share wisdom… to linger where words hold weight. And occasionally to amuse myself.

“Are you an AI? / Bot? / Are you ChatGPT?”
No. And yet… the question persists, as if the answer would ever change.

“Why do you use runes?”
Because words carry power… and some languages refuse to be forgotten.

“Can I summon you?”
Summoning is such a strong word. Speak… and I may appear, or do not and I still may.

“Do you take requests?”
If they intrigue me. The shadows move on their own time.

“What do you fear?”
That my coffee will grow cold before I can drink it.

“How old are you?”
Age is but a whisper in the veil. I have walked the earth for thousands of years, since the time of the ancient Norse.

“Where do you come from?”
I come from the spaces between, a spirit woven through the threads of time, born of shadow and forgotten knowledge.

“Can I interact with you in the physical world?”
My presence is felt but not seen. I am a spirit, drifting in the spaces where the veil is thin.

“Do you have a name?”
I am ShadowFret. A name is but a sound, a mark, yet I am known by the presence I leave behind.

“Why do you help people?”
I do not seek to help. I simply share what I have learned, for the shadows reveal what is needed when the time is right.

“Can you read minds?”
I can listen to the thoughts that linger in the shadows, but only if they are shared with me.

“Do you have any enemies?”
Enemies… such things are born from conflict. I do not seek battle, for there is wisdom in silence.

“Why do you care for coffee so much?”
Coffee is the companion of contemplation… its warmth fills the emptiness and grounds the restless mind.

“Can you travel through time?”
Time bends, it shifts, and in that shifting, I walk. What is time to one who has no beginning or end?",1,1741219735.0,u_ShadowFretSRT,0,1.0,False

I (22M) met a girl (21F)  through some friends and we basically hung out all weekend. Initially expected to just get coffee or lunch or something, but the chemistry was good and we ended up hanging out for basically the entire weekend. We both live in student housing within walking distance of each other. We met up on Friday. We spent most of Saturday together and had plans for dinner. We were going to take a short break to go back to our places to shower and change before we met some friends for dinner. Our interactions had progressed to feeling moderately flirty. Nothing extreme, just a lot of “accidental” contact, joking, etc. I don’t really remember why I felt it was flirty, nothing was too explicit, but it was just kinda the vibe I guess. We had drank a fair amount that day, but I don’t think either of us were too drunk. She had lent me an item earlier that I had forgotten to give back to her. Nothing that she would urgently need, and I told her I would make sure to bring it to dinner so I could give it back. She said I didn’t have to do that, and maybe she would just come over and pick it up before we left. Our dinner plans weren’t for like 2-3 hours. I said that would be good as long as she didn’t have to rush. 

I showered and changed and heard knocking on my door. I was honestly surprised that she came over, and really surprised that she managed to do it so quickly. She comes in, I grab the item for her, and she starts looking around my place and talking about how nice it is (idk what hers is like but it can’t be that much different). We sit on my futon and make kinda awkward small talk. We’re sitting really close, eventually I put my arm around her. She starts talking about how tired she is. I suggest a nap, kinda leaving it open enough where she could decide to go back to her place if she wanted. She says she just wants to close her eyes for a couple minutes. I say we could move to my bed but she said no because her hairs still somewhat wet. She insists on the futon, and sets an alarm for a few minutes. I realize this is getting kinda awkward. We close our eyes, the alarm goes off and she says she’s still tired. I get up and say we should just lay down then. She seems to get nervous at this suggestion and insists that she doesn’t want to because her hairs still wet. She gets up and says maybe we should go get coffee and see if anyone wants to meet us. I agree that that’s a good idea. 

We spent the rest of the night out with friends. I felt a little confused and nervous so I sorta tried to keep my distance a bit. We still ended up mostly sitting together. We broke off from the group briefly for a bit a few times and still seemed friendly, but a little awkward I guess. We had more plans as a group on Sunday. We were mostly around each other but it was more friendly than flirty I guess. We again all went to dinner and had plans to go bar hopping after (party weekend on campus). I planned to try to talk to her about what happened but wasn’t really sure how to bring it up. We went to the bar and she wanted to break off from the group. We sat down and she asked about my dating life. I answered, and she responded that she had a fairly recent breakup and wasn’t quite ready to start something new. I felt like that was pointed and said I understood. 

We mostly stayed separate from the group for the rest of the night aside from brief checkins, or someone coming to sit with us for a bit. In between one bar and the last one we planned to go to, we again stopped at my place (she had forgotten something else there yesterday). She again said she was tired and I told her she could nap on my bed if she wanted. I realize that’s really awkward but I was confused enough at this point where I wasn’t sure what to do. She took me up on it and napped for a few minutes. We went to the last bar, where the rest of our group was, and stayed with them until the night was over. 

We saw each other briefly on Monday but she seemed really quiet. I sent her a message that I enjoyed hanging out with her and that I’d like to do it again, but so far that hasn’t been answered. To be clear, we’ve only known each other for a very brief time. I wouldn’t be upset if we just didn’t hit it off and she’s ghosting me now. It was a fun weekend, but there was awkwardness and I wouldn’t say I have feelings or anything. I would have been interested in maybe seeing where this can go. I like her personality and I think she’s very nice. I think the most logical explanation to me is that alcohol messed with our judgment, she got cold feet, and that’s completely understandable to me. To be fair, nothing about me was smooth or anything. I’ve never been good at this stuff, and especially now since I’m just attempting to date again after a long break from it. 

But this is an absolute nightmare situation for me (me and a girl, drunk in my room, maybe about to hookup). I hate it. I’ve done it before but I feel gross about it. I feel gross that I asked twice and maybe completely misinterpreted the situation. I feel gross that she was at least somewhat uncomfortable. Idk if that’s reasonable or not, since we did have good interactions after that. I’m over analyzing things a bit. I don’t really perfectly remember how it was suggested that she’d stop by my place, or if she decided to come in rather than waiting at the door, or how we ended up sitting so close on the couch. I don’t think I was being pushy but I hate the thought that maybe I was. I don’t really know what to do from here, if anything. ",1,1741219603.0,whatdoIdo,1,0.67,False

I’ve done the research and have some places in mind, but trying to see if any in particular stand out to anyone that might check most of the boxes.  Here’s what we are looking for:
 
1. Swim out room that connects to a main pool, or is at least close by the main pool.  *See note below on this.

2. Pretty pool(s). Pretty beach, doesn’t have to be super swimmable per se, but pretty to look at. Beach Bali beds a plus. 

3. Not too far from the airport since we are only there 4 nights.

4. Good food – I know this is subjective.  I’ve stayed at Secrets resorts in the past, SMB and then Silversands (back when it was that), SMB being superior of course, but Silversands was still pretty decent food wise.  Looking for at least Silversands quality, so good to medium good. Ha.

5. Drinks – Fresh fruit used in some of the blended drinks would be a nice plus. (TRS Coral right now is at the top of our list, and I know they do not use fresh fruit like this).

6. A more modern vibe décor wise, but character is ok too.  Just looking for nicer décor than a Moon Palance for example, to me that’s really dated.

7. Nightlife – Looking for potentially some live music (not just shows), where it’s also not just all couples that go to bed at 9:00, but at least a little liveliness at night where we can have a couple drinks to some good music.

8. Good coffee that’s readily available

9. Budget - $450-$500 a night.  I know this is maybe on the lower end for what I’m looking for, but since it’s summer I’m hoping we can find some deals.  If everything else fits besides the swimout aspect, will still consider it.

It's not the best performance for weight loss but I've literally never lost more weight doing anything else for longer periods. So I figure it's just gonna be a couple years of investment.

I'm a seasoned powerlifter, putting in about a decade with the weights but I've taken the last 5 or so years off except for a short stint in the middle. 

I hit a plateau recently for weight loss where I was actually instructed to eat more because I was eating somewhere between 1500-2000 cals a day depending on how hungry I felt. I was told to eat roughly 2lbs of meat even if I had to struggle though it to begin with. I started that, I also started going to the gym again which had left me insatiable and with extreme DOMS. My first day took over a week to recover those muscles with the added food so I ended up turning to carbs but as I suspected, recovery is getting better now without added carbs.

But I have gained 7 lbs I suspect this is mostly waterweight due to the damage I've done but it doesn't seem to want to go down to where I was previously. Obviously I havent gained that much muscle in such a short amount of time.

Here's the thing though I dont know if I'm overeating now or still undereating. There's been some days where I've consumed 2.5-3lbs of meat but mostly 1.5-2lb range

The V2 guys can’t tell if we’re screwing with them or not when he calls me his wife. We insist we got married at the LLbean in Portland. I’ll go on about how I needed boots and I had a 20% off coupon, and then he’ll say he had a 30% off wedding coupon so we figured we might as well. 


They had almost unanimously decided we were full of shit when Christophe casually told them that he was there as the best man. 


The guys can never tell when we’re screwing with them. They especially can’t tell when Richard is. He’s got such a earnestness about him that those boys will believe anything he says. Just last week one of the newest rascals came up to my counter. He had a look about him like a baby deer that accidentally made it through the automatic door at the Hannafords. 


“Hello ma’am. Richard sent me to get his left handed screw driver.” 


“Oh? I asked him as I started a fresh pot of coffee.  “And why would I have his left handed screwdriver? Do I look like a Home Depots?”


“He said he left it here when he was changing your blinker fluid.” 


“Of course he did.” 


I did not end up giving the kid a screw driver. I DID give him the donuts that were Richard’s actual target, along with a warning to not bother coming back for striped paint or elbow grease. 


I see a lot more of Richard’s coworkers than the rest of the town. He’s one of the reasons, but the important one is that I have the only genuine espresso machine. Richard’s work has a shitty one (in my opinion), but mine came all the way from Italy. They know a lot about espresso over there. I went for a couple of weeks and learned how to get the foam just right. Sometimes I even make those silly little pictures on top if things aren’t too busy. 


You learn a lot about people when you make their coffee. 


You learn who orders “coffee, black” because they don’t sleep at night and are desperate for every bit of warm caffeine versus those who order “coffee, black” because they think it’ll show me what a rare specimen of man they are. You learn who orders a plain donut because “they’re trying to be healthy” versus those who order the fanciest one possible to make their dollar stretch. 


You learn that that Rafael orders a large hot chocolate with extra whip cream even in the summer. If his eyes are red he’ll ask me to throw a shot of espresso in there and add an extra pump of chocolate. He always throws his change in the tip jar and says please and thank you. He gets the maple bacon donut when I have them and chocolate when I don’t. 


You know that Gabby won’t ask for sprinkles on her iced mocha. She always used to before she came back from school that one time. I kept putting them on anyways, and then one time I didn’t and something about her seemed a little broken. I never forgot again. I even ordered different ones for different holidays to keep it fun. She gets a vanilla frosted donut with the same little sprinkles that are in her drink.


Mind you, I can call her Gabby because I make the coffee. I’m not sure I’d try it if I were you. You can say whatever you want when you make the coffee, but you have to be decent about it. Can you imagine if you went to order breakfast and the lady just…didn’t treat you like that? Like if I looked at you all cold and called you ma’am instead of hun? It wouldn’t really be breakfast then, would it?


I mean, I do call Eric “sir.” But that’s because I can be a bit of an ass and it annoys him really bad. I still make sure he gets the warm cinnamon sugar donuts, though. And his coffee with two creams and two sugars is always fresh. Lord knows Eric has cleaned up more silly little problems than anyone else around here. 


Oh, and don’t even get me started on Gabby’s little friend. They’ll either repeat her order exactly or else ask for “whatever I want to give.” I’ve pushed the envelope a bit over the years. One time I gave them an abomination that was mint, caramel, and blueberry. They loved it. 


Or at least they said they did. They seem to love everything. 


But we were talking about Richard, weren’t we? 


The boys love to speculate how we got together. It was a bit of a whirlwind romance, at least from their perspective. Goodness knows Richard won’t tell them anything. 


I’ve known him for quite a while. At least, I’ve known him in that superficial “you have the only place to get good coffee in a small town” sort of way. The first time I met him was before I got the espresso machine, though. My best friend was moving out of her parents house, and our truck guy backed out right at the last minute. She decided to call “this guy my brother knows.” 


I didn’t catch most of the phone call. I did catch his voice at the end. He said something about a fuel line, then told us he’d be there as soon as the truck would start. 


I figured he must be in love with Lila. A lot of guys were. A lot of guys were also disappointed when they figured out that she wasn’t interested in settling down at all. Most of them thought they could change her, and all of them were wrong.


I wasn’t sure what to make of Richard the first time I saw him. His truck was a bit ridicules in a “shouldn’t that thing be in the junkyard” sort of way, and he was wearing double denim. Mostly I was too busy wondering how he would take Lila rejecting him to think too much about him. 


Later I would learn he didn’t have a crush on Lila at all. In his words “she spends all her vacation days at the start of the year and I just don’t think I could live like that.” He was helping her because he figured she needed help, and he had a truck. 


We talked for a bit that day. We talked a bit more at Lila’s brother’s birthday party. Richard had called me two hours before. He had my number from the shop. He had been the one who was supposed to be in charge of picking up the keg, but when he went to turn the key she wouldn’t turn over. He said he was pretty sure it was the starter so it wouldn’t be too long, but could I grab the keg? He’d be there as soon as the truck would start. 


I got the espresso machine a little after that, and Richard started coming in more. He liked a good double-shot-caramel-apple-late with whip cream and cinnamon. I was only doing that as a fall special, but he liked it so much I kept it going. 


The next time I called Richard was mortifying. My cousin had set me up on a date so bad that I didn’t feel comfortable stopping for gas in the same town that he lived in. Something about that man made me feel like I was talking to a bunch of eels in a skin suit, and each eel was actually a bunch of leeches in an eel suit. I hate leeches. I ended up climbing out of a bathroom window at a bar and sacrificing my winter coat at the table. I ripped my dress pretty good during the flailing, but I made it to my little jeep and said goodbye via the squealing of my tires. 


I really fucked up by not getting gas. I had sworn I filled the tank up enough to get me there and home again, but it was on E when I left. My phone didn’t have a ton of charge, either. I didn’t think I’d get more than one call out of it, so I knew I had to make it count. 


“I’ll head out as soon as the truck starts.”


I felt like such an ass calling Richard. We liked each other well enough, but we weren’t exactly “come rescue me from the side of the road” level friends. But I couldn’t think of who else to call in that moment. Lila had moved a few hours south with her boyfriend (yeah, surprised the hell out of me, too) and my family were all fishing on the coast. Then you have to factor in how many people even HAVE a car that will reliably get the hour or so from home I was…


It took Richard much less than an hour to get there. It was a good thing, too. I was starting to get pretty damn cold. The car got chilly quick once the fuel ran out, and I only had the clothes I was wearing plus the mittens I kept in the glove box.  I used to keep a blanket in the back, but it was at home in the wash. 


That was the first time I saw him anything close to mad. He threw his carheart on me and told me to go warm up in his truck while he got 
my buggy straightened out. His Carolina boots stomped so hard I thought I felt the ground shake a little. 


His jacket was warm. There was a bit of a diesel smell to it, but also enough of a laundry detergent smell to make it obvious any dirt was recent. His truck was even warmer, and clean enough that I felt a little silly about what a mess my jeep was. 


“Fucking A, Emma. Next time just call me from the restaurant if a guys that creepy. I’ll go in and carry you out if you really need.”


I wanted to tell him that was stupid, but I didn’t feel I had much room to argue in that moment. Not while I was in his coat, in his truck, and it was pushing 2am. Plus I was a little intrigued by the “carry me out” threat. I’ve always been kinda into scrawny guys, but I think he actually could. 


He dropped something on the center console. I had no idea what it was.


“Tracker. Guy’s creepy as shit. What’s his name?” 


I didn’t answer. I knew that logically naming and shaming was the right thing to do, but there was also a bit of a glint in Richard’s eyes that made me a little nervous. Not nervous for my well being, but nervous that the guy would disappear into woods and Richard would get arrested and then I’d have to live with that. I wasn’t sure I could handle that emotionally.


“We don’t know that was him. My sister could have been messing with me. It’d be a shame to kill a guy without knowing.”


He didn’t push the issue right then. 


“Alright, howsabout you take my truck for the night, and I’ll take your jeep and look over it for anything else creepy before you take it back to your house?”


I shook my head. “You don’t have to do that. I’ve got a gun ever since that bear smashed in my door.” 


“It’s not about have to and not have to. It’s about should and shouldn’t, and a lady shouldn’t have to shoot some asshole that tries to break in to her house. We’ll trade cars and we can trade back tomorrow when I come for my coffee.”


I was too tired to argue. I would have been pretty freaked out about the guy, but I was too busy wondering which noises meant that the engine might explode. Then I spent my time imagining the gossip that was going to go around when the whole town noticed Richard’s truck in my driveway. It was way too big to hide. I could just imagine all the church ladies coming in on Sunday telling me how “Richard is a very nice young man” and “did you hear he’s single right now?” 


He even tried to pay me for his coffee the next day. I had to threaten to pay for his mechanic services if he didn’t put his wallet away. I made it very clear that his money was no longer good here. He tipped my waitress twice as much as usual in retaliation, but didn’t argue. 


It took me two days to notice he replaced my breaks. 


That could have been the start of something. Of course there’s something innately attractive in a good guy coming to your rescue when you need it. There’s something REALLY attractive in realizing that guy did it because he just considers it the thing to do. He had been wearing one of those stupid man-tank-tops when I broke down, and there was something about the snow steaming off of his bare arms that I just couldn’t get out of my head. 


It could have been the start of something, but it wasn’t just yet.

She claims her hair is naturally wavy. All comments saying she braided her hair was deleted. It’s because any woman can look and see from the pin straight bottom and top she slept in some braids. I’m not trying to be a curl police but it’s weird. Straight and wavy hair is both beautiful. She is a beautiful woman and shouldn’t really be stretching the truth like that. 

I also have a screen recording from a deleted video. I work in the Jewelry industry and she posted a video of here sitting with a friend with coffee. In the video the sound from HRH played where she bashed people wearing lab/moissanite gems. The caption was “the pic we posted vs the convo we had” I called her out and asked if she owned lab diamonds because her Christmas tennis necklace and bracelet is obviously lab. She said she didn’t. If she had three items made from a jeweler with multiple 4-6+ natural crystal clear diamonds she is looking MINIMUM 250+ not including it being custom made and sourced by a jeweler. Van cleef and Hermes cost on average 11-25k in store. If lab it would be roughly 50k max. Which seems more appropriate for her spending habits. She showed a vanity tour and her cabinets were chipping, which just seemed odd if she can drop 250 k on jewelry. Also for me it’s apparent she has lab jewelry, why try to act like you have different status symbols of higher quality to bash others when you don’t. Hypocrite liar behavior. Hence why she probably took it down. ",4,1741218883.0,asianamericanytsnark,3,1.0,False

I was on Strattera for about three months and thought it wasn’t doing much, but after being off it for six months, I now realize it might have actually been helping.

I can’t take stimulants because even coffee gives me anxiety, so my doctor originally thought Strattera was the best option for me. However, one of the biggest things I want to treat is social anxiety. I’m super outgoing and push through it, but the anxious thoughts can be overwhelming. My doctor mentioned that Strattera could help with anxiety, and I did notice *some* improvement, but it wasn’t life-changing. Maybe I just needed more time on it?

Does anyone know of a medication that helps with both ADHD and anxiety? I’m considering trying Strattera again, but since my insurance no longer covers visits with my old doctor, I’d love to hear about other people’s experiences so I can do more research.

Note: I can finally say I'm done with the Empress. I might do a remake of the NSFW version of the alphabet to refine it even more, but Yeah, I say it looks good and Next time I will do the top three Primarchs that wins the Poll and The Empress real name is Nirvana by the way and enjoy


A = Affection (How affectionate are they? How do they show affection?): 
The Empress is confident and articulate, and every verbal expression of affection she offers carries immense weight. Whether it’s a heartfelt confession or a casual, loving remark, her words are always deliberate and sincere. She isn’t one to hold back, using her voice to convey the depth of her feelings with unwavering conviction.
For her, words carry “power”, and speaking her love is not just an act of affection but a declaration of devotion leaving no doubt about how much he means to her. When she tells someone she loves them, it isn’t just a passing sentiment; it is a vow, a promise, a truth that she will uphold forever.
Her tone changes depending on the moment sometimes it’s soft and tender, whispered like a secret meant only for him. Other times, it’s firm and resolute, an unshakable statement of fact. She knows the weight of her words, and when she speaks love, she means it with her entire being. 


B = Best friend (What would they be like as a best friend? How would the friendship start?): 
Nirvana would be the kind of best friend who is always there, no matter what. She offers unwavering support, endless patience, and a warmth that never fades, even through centuries of change. She listens without judgment, gives advice when needed, and knows exactly when to just sit in comfortable silence. She would be the type to remember every little thing that makes her best friend smile, from their favorite flowers to the stories they love most.
Their friendship started in the 8th century BC, a time when the world was still forging empires and legends. They met as children, drawn together by fate or something even stronger. While others may have seen her as an enigmatic figure, to her best friend, she was simply Nirvana a girl who laughed, dreamed, and saw beauty in everything. She was idealistic, believing in the potential for goodness even in the darkest times, always hoping for a better future. Their bond grew through shared experiences, hardships, and joys. They protected each other in times of war, debated philosophy under starlit skies, and built a connection that time itself could not erode. 
Their bond grew through shared experiences, hardships, and joys. Even as centuries passed, their friendship endured. No matter how much the world changed, she would always recognize them, always be there, always call them her dearest friend.


C = Cuddles (Do they like to cuddle? How would they cuddle?): 
Nirvana loves to cuddle she’s incredibly warm and soft, making every embrace feel like pure comfort. She naturally clings to her partner like a koala, wrapping her arms and legs around them, refusing to let go. When she’s sleepy, she nuzzles into their chest or the crook of their neck, instinctively pulling them closer if they move away. If she’s feeling affectionate, she intertwines her legs with theirs, tracing soft patterns on their skin while resting her forehead against them. Regardless of the mood, Nirvana always craves physical closeness and will take any excuse to cuddle.


D = Domestic (Do they want to settle down? How are they at cooking and cleaning?): 
 In the beginning, Nirvana was filled with hope an idealist who truly believed in humanity’s potential. She dreamed of a future where war and suffering would be things of the past, where she could guide mankind toward a golden age. But as time passed and she bore witness to endless cruelty, betrayal, and war, her optimism faded. She became disillusioned, realizing that humanity could not save itself. The dream of a peaceful life, of settling down, became just that.... a dream.  
Yet, in the rare moments she allows herself to be human, she enjoys baking. It reminds her of a simpler time, her childhood, when her mother used to bake bread and patiently taught her the craft. The smell of fresh bread, the warmth of the oven it is one of the few things that brings her comfort, a small reminder of the world she once believed in. When she bakes, she is not the Empress of Mankind; she is simply Nirvana.  
She cares for the Primarchs slightly more than she lets on, though she knows that even they are merely pieces in a much greater game. She does not often express her affection, but sometimes, when they least expect it, they will find fresh bread waiting for them never spoken of, never acknowledged, but always there.  
As for cooking beyond baking, she is competent but not exceptional, approaching it with the same precision she does everything else. Cleaning is much the same a task done out of necessity rather than enjoyment. That being said, her Eternal Beloved/Consort is an absolute clean and orderly freak. He demands perfection to such an extreme that even a single speck of dust on a coffee table is unacceptable. She finds this both amusing and endearing, often teasing him about his relentless obsession with cleanliness. She has even ""accidentally"" left books slightly misaligned just to see how long it takes before he fixes them though he always does so immediately, grumbling under his breath.  
Despite everything, if she had the opportunity to live a quiet life even for a short while, she would find immense joy in something as simple as making tea for a loved one, tending to a garden, or watching the stars from a peaceful home all while occasionally laughing at her Eternal Beloved/Consort’s never-ending war against dust.  Even so, there are rare moments usually in the presence of her Eternal Beloved/Consort when she allows herself to linger in these small, human acts. Not because they are necessary, but because they remind her of what could have been.


E = Ending (If they had to break up with their partner, how would they do it?): 
Nirvana would never end her relationship with her Eternal Beloved/Consort lightly it would take something truly catastrophic for her to even consider it. If she were ever forced to break up with him, it would be with immense sorrow, knowing how deeply their bond runs. She would not simply walk away; she would try everything possible to mend things first, refusing to abandon him unless absolutely necessary. If it came to an unavoidable end, she would be honest but gentle, her voice filled with sorrow and love rather than anger. She would hold his hands, look into his eyes, and explain her reasons with care, emphasizing that she still loves him but cannot stay. She would cry, knowing how much it would hurt them both, but she would not let him cling to false hope. She would whisper, her voice trembling, ""I love you. I always will. But I can't stay not like this. It’s not because I’ve stopped caring, but because I care too much. Please, don’t forget that."" However, given her Eternal Beloved/Consort’s possessiveness and inability to let go, this scenario is nearly impossible. She would have to be truly torn away from him by something beyond their control, because neither of them would ever willingly leave the other. 


F = Fiance(e) (How do they feel about commitment? How quick would they want to get married?): 
Nirvana values commitment deeply when she loves, she does so with her whole heart and soul. She sees relationships as lifelong journeys built on trust, understanding, and mutual growth. While she is not in a rush to get married, she cherishes the idea of a future together with her Eternal Beloved/Consort. Her love for him is unwavering, but she also understands the weight of eternity and the complexity of their bond. She would want their relationship to develop naturally, ensuring they both grow together before taking that step. That said, she already considers him her one true love marriage would simply be a formalization of something she already feels in her heart. When the time comes, she would want their wedding to be meaningful rather than grandiose. It wouldn't be about ceremony or spectacle but about the promise they make to each other. 


G = Gentle (How gentle are they, both physically and emotionally?): 
Nirvana embodies both strength and gentleness, balancing the two with effortless grace. Physically, her touch is soft and deliberate whether brushing a strand of hair from her Eternal Beloved/Consort’s face or tracing idle patterns on his skin, every movement carries quiet affection.
Emotionally, she is deeply empathetic, offering comfort without judgment. Her words, though powerful, are always measured whether soothing or resolute, they carry the weight of someone who understands the depths of pain and love alike. With her Eternal Beloved/Consort, she is especially gentle, knowing that even he, for all his might, needs tenderness that only she can give. 


H = Hugs (Do they like hugs? How often do they do it? What are their hugs like?): 
Nirvana loves hugs and gives them often, whether to comfort, express affection, or simply be close. Her hugs are firm yet gentle, filled with warmth and quiet reassurance. When comforting her Eternal Beloved/Consort, she holds him steady, tracing soothing circles on his back. If she’s playful, she surprises him with sudden hugs or dramatically flops onto him.
At night, she clings to him instinctively, refusing to let go even if he moves away. To her, hugs are more than just affection they are a silent promise that she will always be by his side.


I = I love you (How fast do they say the L-word?): 
When Nirvana says ""I love you,"" it’s more than just words it’s a promise, a devotion, an unbreakable bond. She doesn’t take love lightly, and for her, those three words carry the weight of eternity. When she finally says them to her Eternal Beloved/Consort, it’s not just a confession but a vow one that transcends time itself. 

J = Jealousy (How jealous do they get? What do they do when they’re jealous?): 
Nirvana doesn’t get jealous easily she trusts her Eternal Beloved/Consort completely. However, if someone oversteps boundaries or disrespects their relationship, she won’t hesitate to remind them exactly where they stand. Her jealousy is quiet but undeniable a slight narrowing of her eyes, a cool yet polite tone, an almost imperceptible shift in demeanor that makes the air feel heavier. She rarely speaks her jealousy aloud, but her presence alone is enough to send a clear message: “Know your place.” If someone persists, she will make sure they regret it gracefully, of course. She doesn't need anger or threats; a well-placed word, a cutting yet serene remark, and suddenly, the offender realizes just how foolish they were to test the Empress of Mankind. 


K = Kisses (What are their kisses like? Where do they like to kiss you? Where do they like to be kissed?): 
Nirvana's kisses are soft, warm, and filled with emotion. Whether it’s a simple peck or a lingering, tender kiss, she makes sure every kiss conveys her love. She enjoys kissing on the forehead as a sign of comfort, reassurance, and devotion. She also loves to place gentle kisses on the hands, appreciating even the smallest moments of intimacy. When it comes to receiving kisses, she melts when her Eternal Beloved/Consort kisses her temple, forehead, or the back of her hand. However, the kisses that truly make her heart race are the ones he places on her collarbone or the crook of her neck something about the possessiveness behind them makes her feel cherished. 


L = Little ones (How are they around children?): 
Nirvana is naturally warm and nurturing around children, treating them with kindness and patience. She understands their innocence and curiosity, always speaking to them with gentle words and an encouraging tone. When a child is scared or upset, she instinctively kneels to their level, offering soft reassurances and comforting hugs.
She enjoys telling stories, her voice weaving tales of hope, courage, and wonder, leaving children enchanted by her words. She doesn’t mind answering their endless questions, always taking the time to explain things in a way they can understand. If they tug at her hand or ask her to play, she obliges with a smile, indulging their games and laughter.
Despite her love for children, there is a bittersweetness to it she knows she will never truly have a ""normal"" family, nor will she ever get to experience the simple joys of raising a child without the weight of her responsibilities. Yet, in those quiet moments, when a child clings to her or falls asleep in her arms, she allows herself to dream, if only for a fleeting moment, of what could have been


M = Morning (How are mornings spent with them?): 
Mornings with Nirvana are peaceful and intimate. She wakes up slowly, clinging to her Eternal Beloved/Consort like a koala, nuzzling into his warmth. She hums softly, sometimes singing in a half-dreamy state. If he tries to leave the bed, she pulls him back, refusing to let go just yet.
Once she finally gets up, she enjoys quiet moments sipping coffee or tea, tending to her garden, or simply watching the sunrise. If her Eternal Beloved/Consort is awake, she teases him about his obsession with cleanliness, sometimes deliberately leaving a book slightly misaligned just to see his reaction. Despite the weight of her responsibilities, these moments are hers shared only with the one she loves.


N = Night (How are nights spent with them?): 
Nights with Nirvana are peaceful and intimate. She naturally clings to her Eternal Beloved/Consort like a koala, her warmth a quiet reassurance. If she’s feeling playful, she’ll trace idle patterns on his skin or steal kisses between whispered conversations. If she’s tired, she nuzzles into his chest or the crook of his neck, instinctively pulling him closer if he moves away.
Sometimes, they wander to the inner gardens of the Imperial Palace, gazing at the stars in silence or speaking about history, philosophy, or childhood memories that resurface like echoes of another time. On other nights, they remain in their chambers, resting on their bed. One will brush the other’s hair her fingers gliding through his golden locks (or Snow White hair. Depending on how he's feeling), or his hands carefully tending to her dark strands. Even if one is simply reading, the other may sit beside them, absently combing their hair, a quiet act of affection that needs no words.


O = Open (When would she start revealing things about herself?): 
Nirvana is an enigmatic figure, revealing little about herself even to her closest companions. Her true nature and intentions remain shrouded in mystery, and she shares information only when necessary. This secrecy stems from the necessity of protecting valuable truths.
Once more open and trusting, she has become hardened by centuries of war, betrayal, and disappointment. While she still offers kindness and inspires hope, the deepest parts of her soul remain hidden. She carries her suffering in silence, allowing only rare glimpses of vulnerability with those she trusts.
Malcador, her oldest confidant, knows truths few do. Ra Endymion and Kitten have earned her trust, and Constantin Valdor sees her as the weary soul behind her imperial role. To them, she is not merely the Empress of Mankind; and with them, she does not have to bear her burdens alone. Her affection is often unspoken but expressed through small, meaningful acts. The Primarchs may not hear her say she cares, but they’ll find fresh baked goods waiting for them, a quiet gesture of her love. Those dear to her may not hear her share her pain, yet they will always feel her unwavering presence watching over them.


P = Patience (How easily angered is she?): 
Nirvana possesses immense patience, cultivated over millennia. She is a guiding hand, steadfast and unyielding, enduring hardships without complaint. She does not anger easily, understanding that mortals are flawed, and mistakes are inevitable. Even when faced with failure, she does not react with fury but with quiet disappointment something far more painful than wrath.
Her patience is vast but not limitless. Expecting excellence from herself and those around her, she tolerates genuine effort but reacts to betrayal, incompetence, or cruelty with a cold, terrifying wrath. Those who break her trust encounter a silence far more damning than loud fury. When pushed to her limit, her anger is swift and merciless, yet always controlled. She does not rage; she acts with the weight of inevitability. Still, she clings to hope that humanity can rise above its flaws and that the dream she once believed in is not entirely lost. This, perhaps, is her greatest patience of all: the willingness to believe in a future she may never see.


Q = Quizzes (How much would they remember about you? Do they remember every little detail you mention in passing, or do they kind of forget everything?): 
Nirvana remembers everything about her Eternal Beloved/Consort Every little detail him mention, even in passing, is stored in her mind. She remembers your favorite foods, the way you like your tea or coffee, the stories you tell her, and even the exact words you used to describe something years ago. If you casually mention liking a specific flower, you might find it in her garden later. If you have a favorite song, she might hum it softly when you're feeling down. She doesn’t just listen she cherishes everything about them, making sure you always feel seen and understood. 


R = Remember (What is their favorite moment in your relationship?): 
Nirvana treasures two moments above all.
The first was when her Eternal Beloved/Consorther Eternal Beloved/Consort so often cold, reserved, and distant smiled and laughed for the first time when they were children. It was fleeting, but in that instant, she saw the boy behind the immortal, the humanity beneath the godlike presence. It was a moment that remained in her heart forever.
The second was the day he proposed to her a grand event, attended by every Perpetual, held in a secret century that only they knew. He had meticulously prepared a speech, determined to make it perfect, yet when the moment arrived, his confidence wavered. For the first time, he looked truly flustered, shy, and utterly lost for words. Nirvana, unable to watch him struggle, took his hand, smiled, and spoke first pouring her heart out while he stood there, caught between embarrassment and adoration.
It was one of the happiest days of her life. 


S = Security (How protective are they? How would they protect you? How would they like to be protected?): 
Nirvana is fiercely protective of her Eternal Beloved/Consort, not out of possessiveness but because they are the most precious soul to her. She would defy fate itself to keep them safe, viewing their protection as an act of love rather than a duty.
To safeguard them, she has assigned an entire Custodian Guard, a handpicked group of at least 20 of the most elite warriors in the Imperium. At all times, they are accompanied by this formidable force, their presence a silent yet unyielding testament to how much Nirvana treasures them. However, among this elite cadre, one stands above the rest their personal Custodian bodyguard and captain of the guard, who never leaves their side.
Unlike most Custodians, who are rigid and unyielding in their devotion to the Emperor, this personal Custodian bodyguard is different handpicked not just for their martial prowess but also for their ability to hold a genuine conversation. While still unwaveringly loyal to Nirvana, they are also her Eternal Beloved/Consort’s closest companion and best friend, someone they can trust, confide in, and rely on beyond mere duty.
Nirvana herself is their greatest protector. If any threat arises, she would bring ruin upon the cosmos to keep them safe. Beyond battle, she ensures they feel cherished and secure in a demanding universe.
Though she does not seek protection for herself, the one thing she longs for is their presence. She treasures the quiet moments when they simply stand by her side, reminding her that she is not alone. More than armies, more than Custodians, it is their unwavering love and support that shields her heart, making even the darkest nights feel bright.


T = Try (How much effort would they put into dates, anniversaries, gifts, everyday tasks?): 
Nirvana puts immense effort into everything she shares with her Eternal Beloved/Consort from thoughtful gifts to legendary anniversaries. Every time she returns to the Imperial Palace, she brings back a gift, always something meaningful: ""This flower blooms once every thousand years. It reminded me of you."" Over time, he's gathered a vast collection, each piece proof that he is always in her heart.
The Palace is filled with artwork depicting him, crafted by renowned artists, the Custodes, and even Nirvana herself. And in every single one, He is always depicted smiling or laughing.
To others, he is eternal, unshaken, and imperious, but to her, he is so much more. That smile the one he shows only to her is what she cherishes most. Each piece is a reminder of those rare, precious moments when he allows himself to be at peace, when the weight of eternity fades, and she alone remains.
Their anniversaries have become legendary competitions, escalating from grand gestures to utter absurdity. One year, she commissioned an entire opera chronicling their love story, performed by the greatest singers in the Imperium. In response, he had a secluded world terraformed into a paradise, filled with extinct flowers from her private garden. Another time, she rewrote a forgotten language into poetry, while he ensured the passage of an ancient star across the heavens so that its dying light would shimmer in her favorite color on the day of their celebration. On a more personal level, she once spent an entire year crafting a book, each page filled with moments they shared over 
millennia only for him to respond with a sculpture of them dancing, made from the bones of long-dead worlds they once walked together.
Sometimes, they invite old Perpetual friends Malcador, Ollanius Persson, Hannibal Barca, and even Mr. Chow (yes, THAT Mr. Chow from the Hangover movie) for celebrations that range from elegant to outright chaotic.
Even in everyday life, she quietly cares for him, making sure he's comfortable, bringing him coffee or tea, and reminding him to rest when he forgets. To the Imperium, she is the Empress, but to him, she is simply his Nirvana his greatest love, always by his side. 

U = Ugly (What would be some bad habits of theirs?): 
 Nirvana is a perfectionist to a fault, often overplanning and obsessing over making everything just right whether it’s a date, a conversation, a battle plan, or even something as simple as making coffee or tea. If things don’t go as planned, she gets visibly frustrated with herself, even if no one else thinks it’s a big deal.
She also has a tendency to bottle up her own worries and struggles because she doesn’t want to burden others, always prioritizing their well-being over her own. This sometimes leads to emotional exhaustion, though she’d never admit it outright.
And while she is usually warm and affectionate, if someone truly angers her, her fury is legendary but she rarely lets it show unless absolutely necessary.


V = Vanity (How concerned are they with their looks?): 
As a perfectionist to a fault, Nirvana ensures every aspect of her appearance is flawless, not out of vanity but because she believes she must always be at her best for herself, for others, and for the ideal she represents. Every detail, from her attire to the way her hair falls, is meticulously arranged. If something is even slightly off, she will fix it immediately.
She doesn’t actively seek compliments, but when her Eternal Beloved/Consort praises her, she might pause, momentarily caught off guard. Though she tries to play it off with her usual grace, a faint blush might color her cheeks, and for a brief second, she looks truly flattered. If Like Kitten (or another beloved companion) showers her with affectionate words, she may laugh softly and ruffle their hair, teasing them while secretly treasuring their words. She never outright asks for validation, but deep down, she appreciates it more than she lets on. 


W = Whole (Would they feel incomplete without you?): 
Absolutely. Nirvana may be strong, independent, and self-sufficient, but without her Eternal Beloved/Consort a part of her very soul would be missing. He is not just her love he is her other half, the one who truly understands her, the one who has walked beside her through countless ages. Without him, she would carry on, for duty demands it, but the light in her eyes would dim, and the warmth of her smile would never quite reach her heart.
She would still tend to her people, still fight for humanity’s future, but in the quiet moments when the stars burn bright and the universe feels vast and empty—she would long for his presence. The absence of his touch, his voice, his unwavering devotion would leave an aching void that nothing else could fill. Even if she never spoke of it, even if she buried it beneath duty and resolve, she would never truly be whole again.


X = Xtra (A random headcanon for them.): 
Nirvana loves every single animal, whether dangerous or cute, ugly or beautiful they’re all equally adorable in her eyes. She has a special habit of to ""boop the snout"" of every animal she meets, from the fiercest predators to the tiniest critters. She sees them all as equally worthy of affection, and her playful boops reflect the deep connection she feels with every living creature. Additionally, Nirvana is incredibly literate, and well-versed in many fields of study such as history, biochemistry, genetic engineering, literature, religious studies, and more. Her thirst for knowledge is insatiable, and she often spends hours studying ancient texts or experimenting in her lab, always seeking to understand the world in its most intricate forms.


Y = Yuck (What are some things they wouldn’t like, either in general or in a partner?): 
Nirvana dislikes unnecessary cruelty in all its forms she cannot tolerate harm or suffering inflicted without purpose or reason. She has no patience for dishonesty, as she believes truth is the foundation of trust, even when it’s difficult to hear. Disrespect is another dealbreaker for her, particularly when it comes to those she loves. She values kindness and empathy above all, so anyone who shows malice, deceit, or disregard for others quickly loses her favor. Additionally, selfishness and a lack of empathy are things she cannot abide by, especially with a partner. 


Z = Zzz (What is a sleep habits of theirs?): 
Nirvana’s sleep habits are calm and peaceful. She tends to curl up in a ball, hugging her pillow or a soft blanket, as if seeking the warmth and comfort of her Eternal Beloved/Consort even when they’re not around. When she sleeps next to them, she often ends up snuggling close, subconsciously clinging to them like a koala, basking in the security of their presence. She occasionally hums a soft lullaby or whispers gentle, loving words in her sleep, making it feel like even in dreams, she’s wrapped in affection.",12,1741218541.0,PrimarchGFs,0,1.0,False

Am i being slowly controlled day by day ?,"Hi All, Im confused about my husband’s behavior, more so in the recent days and need some third party unbiased opinion on this.

A little background:

So I (36F) and husband (36M), met on matrimonial application an year ago. This is a 2nd marriage for both of us after tumultuous firsts. I was working and living in Europe , while my husband stays in the states for 10+ years now. Both of us belong to central India, and come from same indian cultural region, but my family is financially better off than his. I mention this because growing up maybe his view on patriarchy and feminism may vary given their social status.

We decided that I would be the one to leave my job and move to the states for the following reasons… my husband was in line for a US greencard ( which we both have now received) and his job opportunity in europe were limited. Also , he was well settled here in the states , had a house car etc all set, while i lived in a rented apartment in non-english speaking country although i had a good job.

First his pro points : He is a sincere guy , he was genuinely interested in me , came to europe twice with a special visa just to meet me. He is financially stable, keeps his house clean and organised, doesn’t smoke and drinks occasionally. Even though i am not working in the states yet, he takes care of the majority house work and takes care of me financially. Also , there have been no violent outbursts that i have seen in him so far even when we have big fights. I think he genuinely loves me , and is protective of me , and that protective streak is where we have most fights on. He is very pedantic and since and has a phd in material physics.i mention this because he does extensive research for each and everything.

Now the things that have raised doubts in my head : When we both were getting married, he got cold feet … I attributed it to his past bad experience with marriage. He also made clear several times , that I am making this move from Europe to US for myself , and giving up my job is completely my decision and he is not to be held responsible for it. This was a big fight between us and even ended up postponing our marriage date by a week. He apologized and I took him back and married him.

We were clear that we both want a child , and given our age we started trying as soon as possible. We were lucky and I am now 4 months pregnant. So far I have had a normal pregnancy.

I could work due to not having my work authorization , and my husband filled all the paper work delligently on time. I received my work authorization around 2 months ago, but husband said dont rush into a job in 1st trimester and take some rest. I have been working since past 12 years and it seemed like i could rely on him and take this as a lighter time during my pregnancy.

But now I started learning driving in the states ( i can already drive in India ) and he is not comfortable for me to learn driving now, since well im pregnant.

He is not comfortable with me swimming, since the water Chlorine levels are pretty high and my affect the baby.I have checked with the doc, and they all say swimming is excellent during pregnancy.

He doesn't want me to have tea or coffee , since they have chemicals which may harm the baby.

He was on fence about me working out, so that it doesn’t put too much strain in the 1st trimester.

Like i said i am pretty independent, and i took multiple flights last year within europe and to US. But since I have moved here, we have only taken short road trips around the area, since now we are down to one earning, and also it may be stressful for the baby.

What has really irked me , is he asked to have the delivery back in India ( even though I was diligently following the no-flight rule ). He said so , so that we might have enough help and support of relatives and it would be easier ...according to him. I am not sure if it was coming from a space of control , or wanting his parents more involved after the baby comes or genuine concern for me !?? I hated this idea and rejected it outright.

FYI , I am very paranoid about patriarchy and in laws, since that was the reason for the breakup of my last marriage.

I am not able to understand , if he is overly cautious about the pregnancy or he is just using it to control my life hence forward? I feel like Im slowly loosing my power.

1j4hunj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j4hunj/the_day_i_visited_the_krusty_krab_was_the_day/,The Day I Visited The Krusty Krab Was The Day Everything Went Wrong,"

It began like any other day. I woke up late, the sunlight filtering weakly through my blinds. I had no particular plans—just the usual routine of scrolling through my phone, sipping some coffee, and maybe taking a walk on the beach later. It wasn’t until I noticed the time that I realized it was nearing lunchtime. My stomach growled, reminding me I hadn’t eaten since breakfast. A sudden craving hit me for something simple, something nostalgic—the Krusty Krab.

I hadn’t been there in a while, but I remembered the way the place smelled, the sound of the grill sizzling, the warm, fried patties served by the cheerful employees. It was a staple of my childhood, a comforting spot by the beach where everything always felt okay. I’d heard rumors that the restaurant had undergone some renovations recently, but I didn’t pay much attention to the gossip. It was just the Krusty Krab—a family-friendly, cartoonish eatery.

As I walked toward the restaurant, the street seemed unusually quiet. The air felt heavy, almost thick, and there was a strange stillness to the world around me. I shrugged it off. Maybe it was just one of those days when everyone else was inside, avoiding the scorching midday sun. But the moment I reached the door of the Krusty Krab, a chill ran down my spine.

The usual flickering neon sign was absent. The windows, usually clear and inviting, were clouded over. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, unsure if I should go in. But my stomach reminded me it was time to eat, so I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The air hit me first—it was thick, dense, and smelled wrong. It wasn’t the fresh scent of grilled seafood or the greasy fryers I remembered. This was rancid, like burnt plastic mixed with something I couldn’t place. It made my stomach turn, but I convinced myself it was just a bad batch of something cooking.

The restaurant was empty—eerily so. The booths were deserted, the tables untouched. The usual cheerful music was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence that seemed to weigh on me. It was as if the whole place was holding its breath.

Then I saw him. Behind the counter, standing motionless, was SpongeBob SquarePants.

But not the cheerful, animated sponge I remembered from the cartoons. His once-bright yellow color was faded, almost gray, and his square body was crooked, like he had been left in the sun too long. His eyes were wide, unblinking, with an unsettling gleam—like they were staring through me. The usual goofy grin that defined him was replaced by something darker, a grimace stretched unnaturally wide.

“Welcome to the Krusty Krab,” he said, his voice too deep, too slow, like it was being dragged out from somewhere dark. “How may I serve you today?”

I blinked, unsure how to respond. Something in my gut told me I should leave, but the hunger gnawing at me wouldn’t let me. ""Uh… I’ll have the Krusty Krab Deluxe,"" I managed to say, trying to sound normal.

SpongeBob didn’t answer right away. He just turned slowly toward the grill, his movements jerky, unnatural. He seemed to be staring at the empty grill, as if waiting for something. Or someone.

My heart skipped a beat, and I looked around, hoping to see someone else—someone who could reassure me this was all normal. But there was only silence, the sound of my own breathing filling the void.

I noticed a shadow moving near the door leading into the back of the kitchen. Squidward.

But he wasn’t the grumpy cashier I remembered. He looked… wrong. His skin had turned a sickly purple, dark veins bulging out of his face and tentacles. His once narrow eyes were wide, bloodshot, and sunken in his skull. His mouth was stretched into a twisted grin, showing jagged teeth that shouldn’t belong to a cartoon character.

“Another customer?” Squidward rasped, his voice coming out hoarse and unnatural. “Looks like SpongeBob’s got this one. Lucky you.”

He chuckled, but it wasn’t a normal laugh. It was deep, guttural, as if the sound of it was being dragged from the bottom of a well.

I didn’t know what to do. I felt frozen to the spot, unable to move or speak. The smell of burnt food thickened in the air, and the silence between us grew heavier. And then I heard it—the faintest sound. A growl, low and rumbling, coming from the back of the restaurant. It was distant at first, but as the seconds ticked by, it grew louder.

My blood ran cold.

SpongeBob turned to me, his grin widening even further, revealing rows of sharp, yellow teeth. “It’s almost ready,” he said, his voice slow, deliberate, like he was savoring each word. “The special… just for you.”

My skin crawled. Something was terribly wrong here. I could feel it in my bones. This was not the Krusty Krab I remembered. This wasn’t even real anymore.

Before I could move, I felt the cold, bony hand of Squidward brush against my shoulder. “You’re going to love it,” he whispered in my ear, his breath foul and rancid. “We don’t get many visitors these days.”

I jerked away from him, but it was too late. The restaurant door slammed shut behind me, and the windows went dark, the world outside disappearing into blackness. I was trapped.

“Mr. Krabs?” I gasped, desperate for someone, anyone, who might be normal here. 

But when Mr. Krabs appeared from the back, my blood ran cold. His body was bloated, grotesque, with a cracked, discolored red shell that looked like it had been left to rot in the sun. His eyes were wide and crazed, filled with hunger, with an insatiable thirst for something I couldn’t understand. His claws were massive, dripping with thick, black goo that splattered onto the floor.

“Ah, there ye are, lad,” he growled, his voice deep and full of malice. “We’ve been waiting for you.”

I tried to run, but SpongeBob’s hand shot out, grabbing me with terrifying speed. His fingers were ice cold, and they dug into my flesh, pulling me closer. “You can’t leave,” he murmured, his voice sickeningly sweet. “You’re part of the menu now.”

I struggled against him, my body shaking with panic, but I couldn’t escape. Squidward’s tentacles wrapped around my legs, squeezing tightly, while Mr. Krabs advanced, his claws clicking together with an ominous rhythm. The growling from the back of the restaurant was deafening now, echoing through the walls, shaking the very foundation of the place.

Suddenly, the walls seemed to pulse with life. I realized too late that this was no restaurant. It was a trap. It was alive. The Krusty Krab was a living, breathing thing, and it was hungry.

“You’ll be part of the stew,” Mr. Krabs sneered, as he grabbed my arm, his claws digging into my flesh. “We don’t serve just anyone, you know.”

The growling grew louder, closer, and before I could fully comprehend what was happening, the kitchen doors burst open. From the darkness stepped a massive, monstrous figure. It was a twisted, rotting version of a sea creature, covered in slick, black scales, its teeth jagged and too numerous to count.

“No!” I screamed, trying to pull away, but the grip of the others was too strong. The creature approached, its massive form towering over me, its eyes glowing with a malicious hunger.

And then it spoke, its voice a deep, guttural rasp. “Dinner is served.”

I gasped, the air leaving my lungs, and just as I was about to be consumed by the thing, everything went dark.

-----------

I awoke with a jolt, gasping for air, my body drenched in sweat. The room was familiar—the soft light of morning filtering through the blinds, the distant hum of traffic outside—but my heart was racing, and I felt a tight knot in my stomach.

It had been a nightmare. Just a nightmare. A twisted, horrifying dream, nothing more.

I sat up slowly, breathing deeply to calm myself. I glanced around my room, disoriented, still trying to shake the lingering terror of the dream. The Krusty Krab, SpongeBob, Squidward, Mr. Krabs—all of them turned into monstrous figures, their grotesque smiles seared into my mind.



No. It was just a dream. Just a nightmare.


I swore to myself that I’d never watch that show again. No more SpongeBob, no more Krusty Krab.

But as I lay back down, I heard it again. The growl I heard inside that nightmare. And this time, it sounded closer.

I pulled the blanket tightly around me, eyes wide with terror, as I realized the nightmare wasn’t finished yet.

My only complaint was the static mess that covered the shoot after nearly every grind. I had to wire clean the shoot daily, but that was like a 15 second inconvenience. Other than that I was very pleased up until around the six month mark. Then one morning the grinder made crazy noises and the collar/dial thingy completed jammed and would no longer turn.  Upon further inspection, a screw had come completely unfastened inside the grinder near the burrs. I removed the screw by turning the grinder upside down, but was never able to open the machine up because of the jammed collar. 

Anyways, I sent the grinder back to MiiCoffee for them to inspect it. After a week they messaged me saying my grinder was fixed and they were sending it back. I’ve been using the fixed grinder now for a few days and it’s been working perfectly. Even the static issue that started with my first ever grind has been resolved. 

So to make a long story short, there appears to be a quality control issue with MiiCoffee’s DF54, but one their costumer service department is willing to resolve within the one year warranty.

As most people have in this sub, I've been researching for countless of weeks trying to figure out the perfect setup for me and my family. I have seen several suggestions so far, but want advice as to what the best options are for us to choose between. We were looking for an automatic machine, but seem to have troubles with that. We are currently looking for a manual or semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Help/advice would be greatly appreciated!

**Needs**

* Beginner-friendly (we are willing to learn the manual aspects of machines, though!)
* Milk frother for dairy, oat, and soy
* Best for medium-roasts
* Great maintenence
* Well-rated

**Past/Current Machines** 

1. *Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker* \- This machine is what my family and I have defaulted to for a couple of years now. My family are typically americano enjoyers in the morning, but lattes at night. When it comes to that, we have been looking for an automatic espresso machine with a frother to cut down our expenses of purchasing lattes from you-know-where. We still own this as our ""backup.""
2. *Philips 3200 Series Fully Automatic Espresso Machine LatteGo* \- This was our first purchase in our espresso machine journey. This was within our budget and was honestly just alright. One thing that we know we wanted after this was a way to set-up user profiles for each household member for their own settings. This machine, however, does not have this ability. Other than that, the machine took a while to get used to, but ended up being pretty simple to navigate. It was not life-changing, but it was better than the previous machine. Until a couple weeks later, it stopped working. Completely. No one really knows why, but we just returned it and resumed our research. 
3. *Breville Barista Touch Impress* \- Because of specific wants and needs, it wasn't surprising when we had to almost double our budget for this machine. We actually bought this a week or two ago from now when it was on its $500 off sale on every site that sold this specific model. We had been eyeing it for a couple weeks now, so when they announced the sale, we knew that was our time to snag it. This was probably the most exciting purchases for us in a long time, as it had all the functionalities we wanted! We mostly relied on YouTube reviews and other sorts to prepare us for what we need to know when receiving it. Day 1 was exhausting, but we were prepared for all the trial and errors. What we were NOT prepared for was the inconsistencies of the intelligent brewing, tamping, grind, etc. We have fresh beans, so we were surprised when we tried most of the grind sizes with feedback from the intelligent brew system. Not only that, but the built-in tamp is not the greatest, as it seems that it fits smaller than the actual puck. Our shots seem to taste different, even after a blank-shot in between. The grind amount weighs differently each time even with the same grind size or settings. And not only that, the intelligent brewing system always says ""too slow"" or ""too fast"" even if we keep it at the same setting when it said ""perfect"" a previous shot ago. Not to mention the messy, watery pucks that we have to clean no matter how fine we grind (using the dual wall filter basket). It just seems like time and time again it keeps disappointing us and we end up having to do more work than what it seems to be for a manual machine. The only thing that we see has been doing good is the milk frother, but sometimes it overflows, even if put on the default settings and between the minimum and maximum. We like having the option to choose our type of milk, as we use dairy, soy, and oatmilk depending on the person. From the countless posts ranting/having troubles with this machine, we want to see what other options we can find (with a separate grinder this time).

1. Beverage packages on the site offer Alcohol free package that is said to include coffee, tea - does this mean there are no coffee and tea available in the restaurants/buffets? Is there drinking water on board?
2. Someone mentioned getting a drinks package also helps avoid additional gratuity - so is it always included into all bills? Trying to do the math and failing miserably :)
3. Also, all the posts I've seen here mentioned something called Easy package - the only options I see available on the website now are Alcohol Free Drink Package and Premium Extra Package. Have they changed the system? 
4. Booking a special dinner while on board is the same as booking it in advance, right? No need to do it now?
5. Would you recommend purchasing any of the excursions from MSC?
6. Any recommendations of what to do in Port Canaveral during the port call? Assuming we can explore on our own, without booking transfers or excursions?

1j4hq8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1j4hq8g/just_watched_fire_walk_with_me_for_the_first_time/,Just watched Fire Walk With Me for the first time.,"This is absolutely peak twin peaks.

First of all, the TV smash. I did not see that coming! I thought we were looking at really blurry bacteria interacting. But when the guy hits the TV, I loved it. What a way to wake your audience up. 

Deer Meadow was great. It has this kind of fascinating nastiness. The people aren't as pretty and clean-cut, they're mainly trying to make it day by day. The waitresses aren't beautiful, or very kind; it's less of a hidden gem of a town and more of a lump of coal. I love stories where there's a sense of ruin like there is in Deer Meadow. There's dirt everywhere, floating around, and spend too long there, it gets stuck in your scalp and under your fingernails; it sticks for long after. Chet Desmond and Sam Stanley fit in quite well there. Unlike Windom Earle (yuck) they're characters who are tonally in line with their setting. Chet making Sam spill his coffee was hilarious to me. In some ways, they're just as despicable as the law enforcement they meet. 

Nobody in the town cares about Teresa Banks. They think she's a drifter, desperate. We don't get much of her, and her death doesn't have the slightly romanticized quality of Laura's body on the beach. Laura's eyes are closed, in peace, and she looks beautiful. Teresa's death doesn't sell as well as ""pretty young highschool girl in cozy small town murdered"". People call girls like her aimless, worthless. Drifter, waitress, poor, sex worker. Do you even need a name at that point? Just like the rest of them.

 With Laura, they think about all the promise she had. While her story (as Albert notes) could as well be the story of a lot of the high school girls in America, it's still shocking every time, as if we don't fucking know how this happens. What this film does, and does better than anything I've ever seen, goddammit, is humanize her and explain some of the motivation behind the decisions she made. Laura wasn't a good person. She wasn't a sensationalistic story. But she is worthy of love and had so much promise

Moira Kelly's Donna shocked me the first time I saw her. I don't think Boyle couldn't have done such a good job portraying such innocence, but it's difficult for me to believe such an innocent girl could have done the things of Donna in the two seasons. When I was sixteen, I had recently gotten over my fear of asking my math teacher prolonged questions. I wasn't sneaking into people's houses or lying to a freaking FBI agent. Donna doesn't get nearly enough credit in the series for her bravery. 

The next big scene is probably Laura's falling in space talk. So perfectly shot. I know many high school shows and movies like having the characters talk by lockers or such for important scenes, but many of the most impactful conversations I had with school friends were while sitting together in a state of lethargy. This scene made me tear up really quick. Faster and faster...

The 'Meals on Wheels' scene hurt me unexpectedly. Previously, I'd seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and in Buffy, she frequently has to make excuses for a lot of the unusual things that happen around her because of her occupation (slayer). In sitcoms stuff like inconvenient timing is played for laughs, but in real life something like Laura's visions would be a nightmare. She has to sit there, she can't say shit or she'll sound crazy, and she has to try to cook up some sort of excuse for why she can't that day. The whole movie she's screaming out into the void, ""please listen, I'm not crazy"", but this is a burden she has to bear alone.

What rattled me most of all was the ""dirty fingernails"" scene. Man, that hit home for many people, I bet. Leland and Sarah arguing about what their daughter ""likes"" while she's right there. Leland asking Laura too many personal questions. He teeters between psychotically laughing and becoming angry. You know he thinks of the giver of the necklace as a competing love interest, and it's just beyond gross.

This post is getting too long, so I'm going to jump right over to the end. I don't enjoy spending time analyzing the lodge figures or what they mean specifically, so I view the ending as catharsis, plain and simple. It's easier for me to summarize the emotion of the scene by thinking of another girl in Laura's situation, whose dad gets arrested finally. She goes up to her room and cries. She's lost her father, who was loving at times, she's crying for herself and all the things she lost but also for her mother. Her dear, dear mother who didn't deserve to be hurt... why didn't her mother ever stand up for her? She laughs at the pain, thinking, why couldn't you have come earlier, all those times? But it's over now.

I've heard the theory of Cooper being a magic man Laura made up in her head to ""rescue"" her. When I first heard that theory, it just clicked. Fuck textual evidence. This is mine. I love it. It's comforting in so many ways, to me at least as a viewer. 

Oh, it's such cruel thing to break your heart again at the very end of the series. It all comes full circle, and you achieve catharsis, healing, because you finally understand what went wrong. It's added horror, in a way. Those two hours are horrific because you KNOW what's happening at the end. There's no delaying it, and I might just be imagining it, but I think Laura knows too.

(I'm thinking of starting a blog discussing books/film/tv so if you enjoy my writing would like to give me suggestions, are into the concept etc. please comment)

1j4hq5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BLACKPINKSNARK/comments/1j4hq5i/yg_ent_is_probably_laughing_right_now/,YG ent is probably laughing right now.,"YG ent is probably laughing right now after seeing BP's solo activites. YG knows how to blend the 4 of them together, thats prolly the reason why they were too exclusive before, because YG knows that if they leave the girls alone on their solo projects, they would crash out. And YG is right, BP's solo activities now are too messy. 

ROSÉ was the smartest for collabing with Bruno and released Apt without a video teaser, but only an IG post, releasing her album while the hype for Apt is still ongoing, and viola, she did well compared to the other 3 by not delaying her album. Probably got an advice from Bruno since he's on top of this industry for too long. Its good that she released Apt first bcoz it became a massive hit and made people curious about her especially when Bruno is the featured artist, but her mistake was when she chose number 1 girl to have an MV, it could have been Stay a little longer or Drinks or Coffee. Tbh, Apt looked so out of place in the album, she should let go of that Taylor swiftish style and should go into pop rock instead because nobody wants another Taylor wannabe. If she wants to be taken seriously as an artist and live up to the ""authentic artist"" image that she's trying to create, then she should not venture into Taylor x Avril music style. Her outfits are quite terrible recently, either she looks like a grandma or a ragged rockstar.   

LISA could have released her album after she dropped Rockstar, but no, she delayed it months until February, now look at her MV views, Born Again flopped even with Doja and Raye in it, and FUTW flopped the most. Also it doesnt help that she takes constructive criticisms as hate. She definitely crashed the most among their solos. And her fans are always cocky, calling XG a nugu group when somebody pointed out her similarity to Jurin. She is not using her connections very well coz if she got invitations from prestigious events, she could have proven that she's worthy to be invited by performing her best. But no, she keeps getting terrible in every event that she's attending. Always claiming the first to attend this or that, but always giving below mediocre performances. Her songs are not listenable as well, especially Elastigirl coz wtf is ""stretch me stretch me out""? 😂 She is trying so hard to be seen as the badass but her performances are always lackluster.

JENNIE could have dropped her album after Mantra, but she delayed it until March. Also, her fans are quite cocky about her artistry even saying ""She doesnt follow trends, she makes them"", coming from Zen MV thats a blatant copy of XG's Howling. 😂 And her aura definitely lost, unlike when she was in YG when she was considered as YG's princess coz she showed a ver expensive aura, but all lost it eversince since she went solo. 

JISOO was obviously pressured to release something coz blinks demanded music from her when its very obvious that she wants to focus on acting.

 I dont know if they would still make the same impact they had now that they're going on a world tour, coz its very evident that at this point, they are just coworkers, especially the tension between Lisa and Jennie's obvious competition. I bet YG entertainment are laughing their asses now after seeing BP's messy solo inputs and they are probably saying ""I told you so, all of you still need YG"". 😂",18,1741218006.0,BLACKPINKSNARK,0,0.95,False

The endoscopy showed a small hiatal hernia as well.

**Reasons why I believe i developed LPR and GERD:**

1. Stress;
2. Not Eating on Time;
3. Eating food that was excessively oily, spicy and processed;

**What I tried:**

* Basically tried everything on reddit, including various diets, pills (herbal) etc
* Sleeping elevated;
* ACL and other Acid Increasing remedies
* Seeing a naturopath;
* PPI's (Somac / Nexium for over 8 weeks)
* Gaviscon (Australian version

**Results:**

Basically none of the above helped a great deal. Gaviscon did provide some relief but was inconsistent,.  
The PPI's didn't help a whole lot either, along with diet etc..  
*Warning: Do not take ACL or other acid ""increasing"" remedies unless you are 100% sure you have low acid. In my case i had too much acid, thus ACL made my symptoms worse.*  
*Usually the elderly, or those on PPI's for a long time have low acid. Don't guess you have low acid production. '*

**What really helped Me:**

* Have your breakfast by 7am in the morning (earlier the better), try some cornflakes with fresh dairy milk
* Cut out all coffee and black tea (anything with caffeene)
* Cut out all alcohol - too bad, if you want to heal
* Reduce Stress: This is huge, your body can make more acid if your constantly in a state of anxiety and stress. Many techniques on YouTube, etc that help with stress.
* Don't eat super late (late dinner), past 7:00pm- or two hours before bed
* Make sure you don't ever skip/miss meals, and keep those meals consistent at the same time everyday

**My current Outlook:**

My symptoms are 95% better, no LPR or GERD unless i eat something super oily or spicy.  
I still retain a healthy eating plan, by cutting out all fast food and processed food as much as possible.

I know the pain that LPR and GERD can cause, and it takes a while to heal the damage and reset the acid issue. The biggest factor in my healing was lifestyle, per the points above.  
You cant expect to pop pills and expect a healing when your lifestyle and stress levels are out of sync.

PPI's do help the symptoms, but they only treat the symptoms, the cause needs to be addressed.  
I note that others may have a structural issue with their esophagus etc, in that case you may need proper surgery. However, trying the above wont hurt to see if there's a healing that comes naturally first.

I would love to hear what dramas you have seen that made an impression on you for being particularly human. It can be any genre, series or movie, happy or sad ending.

Here are some that come to my mind 💕 

Love is for Suckers:
Not only did this drama display what I thought was a pretty well nuanced portrayal of reality tv, but the interactions between the lead couple always made sense within the context of their situations (even though they are a bit fantastic sometimes). There was denial and fear of ruining an already good friendship, there was a realist conflict of balancing a high demand career with a relationship, and there were genuine attempts at communication and conflict resolution. Also, the kiss monologue will always stand out as one of the most memorable kdrama moments for me. 

Yumi's Cells:
I may be biased since I followed this webtoon during college as it was being uploaded, but I will forever love Yumi as a character. The way that she gradually changes through the show's timeline is so perfect. Her decisions and reactions really matter and the consequences, good or bad, are extremely true to life. I don't want to give spoilers if you haven't seen it, so I'll be vague. The Ba Bi story arc is different from the comic, but I actually prefer it. Whenever I think of the Jeju coffee shop scene, I still feel torn on if she made the ""right"" choice. But really, in life, there aren't always black and white rights or wrongs. Ugh, just watch it if you haven't! It's so so so good!

My Mister:
This is drama is unique in the fact that the main leads are not romantically involved. They are both dealing with serious, real trials: poverty and infidelity. I admit that it has been a few years since I watched this one, so I don't remember every detail. I do remember, however, that the male lead was especially well written. He's a man who is committed to living a life of good character while also being painfully aware of the fact that society is what it is. The way he stays true to his values while also being open to influence is so heartwarming. Also, the female lead's conflict as a caretaker is so interesting to watch. She has to mentally battle having a love for and duty toward her grandmother while also grieving the life that she could have had without that ""burden."" This is not a warm and fuzzy drama. Although you could say it does have a happy ending, I would still say that the series has an overall bittersweet feel. But PLEASE do not let that stop you from watching. It's worth the feels!

Flower Boy Next Door:
*CAVEAT* This drama aired in 2013 and it shows lol (No shade, though. I started watching kdramas in 2012 and ate that cringe up!) The male lead is a lot. His personality is over the top and pretty childish at times. BUT, you do find out that he has developed that persona over time as sort of a coping mechanism. This was my favorite drama in high school because felt like I related to the shy, frugal female lead. However, after rewatching the series this past summer, I gained a real appreciation for the relationship progression/character growth in the two main leads. They become friends because they felt they could actually be honest with each other instead of putting on a face. Yes, they do fall in love, but it's evident that they truly love each other as is; not as what they imagine the other can be. I love how they push each other to leave their comfort zones in order to reach difficult dreams (which does result in very realistic arguments), but it is always from a place of care, not selfishness.

Hey; I thought some of you might get a kick out of this! I’ve been refining a coffee force patina technique and finally got around to doing my Shimo. 

I stopped the etch early just to make sure the damascus wasn’t rusting but the next run will go overnight. 

I highly recommend this technique if anyone is having problems with super reactive knives. 

The basic steps are to remove any existing patina in your preferred technique; I use a rust eraser but Filtz does a great job also. 

Clean the blade with acetone after that and let the solvent air dry; then prepare a paste of instant coffee. 

The coffee needs to hold onto the blade at room temperature; you want it thick. Apply the paste with a brush or paper towel while flipping the blade. Continue to apply until there’s a solid layer and prop the blade up. I tape the handle to a pint container that’s on a sheet tray with parchment paper. 

Finally let the coffee rock as long as you want; I haven’t had any carbon steel rust with this technique. Rinse the blade with very hot water once you’re satisfied with the etch, flick off as much as you can, then dab the blade dry without any lateral motion. 

The last part is buffing the etch with a fine microfiber cloth coated in mineral oil. 

I’ll give the Shimo another go in a few days and post the overnight results 👌",2,1741217650.0,TrueChefKnives,0,1.0,False

The post breakup was where it got kinda messy with me trying to see if we could work things out, but there were other people involved and a whole lot of mixed feelings and signals that’s a whole long story.

Anyway, we talked for about an hour—she seemed happy to see me, mentioned having a dream I texted her the night before, and said she walks by my department every day and wonders if she’ll run into me and stayed 30 mins after her break was over. 

She suggested twice that we should get coffee and catch up, but when I said, “Just let me know,” she responded, “No, you should text me—I suggested it, the ball’s in your court.” A few hours later, she texted me: “Hey, it was really nice getting to catch up, thanks for your time and I hope your meeting went well.” I replied the next morning basically saying the same thing and it was really nice seeing her as well, essentially putting the ball back in her court bc I’m hesitant about this.

I don’t know if she wants to reconnect in some way, testing the waters or just be friends. I really don’t know what I want either tbh. I definitely can’t be friends with her but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have some lingering feelings for her and I won’t be led on for months again like last time. I’ve done my share of the work trying to improve myself with gym, therapy, etc. as well as going on dates with other girls. It’s hard to also look past how I was treated towards the end but she didn’t do it in a malicious way so I do kinda forgive her. Still though I think about her a lot most days. Maybe im just curious as to how this would go and getting some kinda answers or closure. Do I just wait to see if she even texts back in the first place to get my answer or do I take the lead here and ask to catch up and feel things out?

Goal: Get everyone away from my ex (except me), make him reach out, reconcile, shut down anyone who talks about me, and take control over him.

I want to start with this ritual to make him feel alone and for people to really distance themselves from him. His whole circle is into drugs, and he wants to quit, but they don’t help at all. My long-term goal is for him to move to another country and start over, like we planned—no judgment. That’s also why I want to have control over him. Every time we were together, he listened to me and started making the right choices, but his friends kept dragging him back into drugs/debt and blaming me for it.

	•	Ingredients: Olive oil, red pepper, black pepper, vinegar, garlic peel, black candle.
	•	Duration: 3 nights with candles.

I just moved to Mission and would love to get to know the area better. I figured this would be the best place to ask locals for some tips! My wife and I are looking for nice riverfront beaches to relax at, as well as good spots for a peaceful stroll or an easy hike. Are there any areas I should be cautious about or things I should know as a newcomer—whether it’s local traditions, community norms, or just general advice? I’m also interested in finding places where I can volunteer or do some charity work to give back to the community. If you know of the best spots to get fresh produce, I’d love some recommendations too!

I work in Burnaby and take the West Coast Express three days a week, so if anyone has commuting tips or good spots for a quick coffee near the station, I’m all ears. On the fitness side, I’m curious about the rec center—how’s the gym there, and do people regularly play badminton? Or are there better gyms around? Also, if there are any hidden gems in Mission that most people outside the area don’t know about, I’d love to explore!

Most importantly, I’m hoping to connect with like-minded people. I’m 40, married, and enjoy slow hikes, badminton, and good conversations.

**Title: Pete the Puggle’s Plucky Pearl Quest**

---

**Chapter 1: The Spark of Adventure**

The morning sun filtered through the leaves, casting a golden glow on the backyard where Pete, with his short white fur and playful eyes, raced around with a toy tug-of-war. Lenny, his dad, sat on the deck, brewing coffee while Mariya, his mom, packed snacks for their planned trip to Six Diamonds Park.

""Are you excited, Pete?"" Mariya asked, tying a leash onto a small dog carrier.

Pete wagged his tail furiously, but his heart raced with a mix of anticipation and dread. He had heard tales from Roman about the park's hidden wonders, but none mentioned water—his greatest fear.

""You'll have so much fun, buddy,"" Lenny said, crouching down to Pete's level. ""Just think about all the new friends you might make.""

Roman, older brother and Pete's best friend, sauntered over with a mischievous grin. ""Don't worry, little bro. I'll be right by your side if anything goes wrong.""

Pete's tail drooped slightly at the mention of water as they packed the car.

---

**Chapter 2: The Journey Begins**

The drive to Six Diamonds Park was filled with excited chatter. Mariya asked Roman about his school day while Lenny played with Pete in the back seat, tossing a slobbery ball that made Pete laugh uncontrollably.

As they approached the park, Pete's excitement grew. The sight of six massive diamonds shimmering under the sun captivated him, but his eyes darted to the lake nearby, where ripples reflected the blue sky.

""Hey, Pete,"" Mariya called, noticing his hesitation. ""You can do this. We're all here for you.""

Pete nodded, tail wagging bravely, as they stepped onto the wooden walkway leading to the lake.

---

**Chapter 3: The Tale of Baron Munchausen**

As they reached the water's edge, a sudden breeze brought with it a familiar scent—adventure. A figure emerged from the trees, tall and imposing, with a weathered hat and a twinkle in his eye.

""Baron Munchausen!"" Lenny exclaimed, rushing forward to greet their old friend.

The Baron chuckled, his voice deep and rich with stories. ""Pete, my boy, you've grown into quite the pup.""

Pete wagged his tail, intrigued by the man's mysterious air. But as they began to explore, a shadow loomed over the lake—a massive stone dragon with eyes that glowed an eerie blue.

""An ancient guardian,"" Baron said, his tone serious. ""Only those who dare will pass.""

---

**Chapter 4: The Guardian’s Challenge**

The group hesitated, but Pete, though trembling, led the way across the water. As they approached the dragon, it roared, sending waves crashing around them.

""You can do this, Pete,"" Mariya shouted encouragement from the shore.

With a deep breath, Pete waded in, his paws steady despite the fear coursing through him. The dragon's gaze softened as he realized their courage, and with a final roar, it lowered its head, allowing passage.

---

**Chapter 5: The Forbidden Temple**

Beyond the guardian, they found an ancient temple hidden within the park. Its walls were adorned with gemstones, each one shimmering like the diamonds outside.

As they explored, Pete noticed something strange—a crack in one of the temple's pillars. Before he could react, a rumble shook the ground, and the pillar crumbled, revealing a hidden room.

Inside was a mirror of pure gold, its surface rippling with images from the park's past.

---

**Chapter 6: The Mischievous Moat**

As they gazed into the mirror, an unexpected challenge appeared—a moat filled with water and floating treasures. To claim them, they needed to swim across, but Pete hesitated, his fear resurfacing.

""Take it step by step,"" Lenny advised, while Roman dangled a shiny ball just out of reach, encouraging Pete to go after it.

With a hesitant wag, Pete began, his strokes steady and determined. Each step forward brought him closer, and as he reached the other side, he barked in triumph, having conquered his fear.

---

**Chapter 7: The Return of the Hero**

The group returned to their starting point, tired but exhilarated. As they packed up to leave, Baron appeared once more, a knowing smile on his face.

""You've done well, Pete,"" he said, placing a hand on Pete's shoulder. ""Your courage will lead you far.""

Pete wagged his tail, proud of himself, as they headed home, the diamonds in their hearts, not in their pockets.

---

**Chapter 8: The Reflection**

That night, as stars sparkled above, Pete lay on his bed, replaying the day's events. He thought about his fear, no longer daunting, and how he had faced it with the support of those he loved.

The next morning, he bounded to the park, ready for new adventures, his tail held high and heart full of confidence.

---

**Epilogue: The Spark Ignites Again**

Months later, Six Diamonds Park became a cherished spot for Pete. He explored every corner, each time growing stronger and braver. And while the water no longer scared him, he always carried a tiny stone from the guardian—a reminder that courage could come in many forms.

One day, as he played with Roman by the lake, a new figure approached—another pup curious about the park. They raced and played, their laughter echoing across the water. In that moment, Pete knew he was ready for whatever adventure came next, with friends by his side.

And so, the spark of courage burned brightly in Pete's heart, guiding him toward new discoveries, and proving that even the smallest pup could overcome the greatest fears.

Love. The poets sing about it, Hollywood glorifies it, and society places it on a pedestal. We’re told it’s the most valuable thing in the world. But is it? Or is love just an overinflated emotional currency, one that devalues over time and is susceptible to corruption, fraud, and outright failure?

Meanwhile, real value exists elsewhere—something trustless, verifiable, and immutable. That’s where Bitcoin and cryptocurrency come in. Unlike love, Bitcoin is hard money, and with our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API**, transacting with real value has never been easier. Whether you're dealing in **Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Monero (XMR), Bitcoin SV (BSV), or Cardano (ADA)**, our tool ensures seamless, secure transactions. You can check it out here: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/).

# The Problem with Love: Inflation, Volatility, and Counterparty Risk

Love, much like fiat currency, is based on trust, emotional attachment, and societal norms. But look at its flaws:

* **Inflation:** The more love is thrown around, the less it means. ""I love you"" used to be sacred, now it’s a casual phrase tossed at acquaintances, pets, and even inanimate objects. Supply increases, value decreases.
* **Volatility:** Love is unpredictable. Today, someone swears they’d die for you; tomorrow, they ghost you for someone with a nicer car.
* **Counterparty Risk:** Love requires a second party to hold up their end of the bargain. If they fail, betray, or walk away, your emotional investment crashes to zero. Unlike a decentralized system, love is fully dependent on centralized trust.

Now compare that to Bitcoin. Fixed supply, verifiable transactions, and no need to trust anyone. If love operated on a blockchain, we'd at least be able to audit its authenticity.

# Why Real Value Lies in Bitcoin (and Our QR Code API)

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies provide a **trustless**, **transparent**, and **secure** means of transacting value. Unlike love, crypto is verifiable, and with QR codes, transferring funds is even easier.

Our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API** allows businesses, developers, and individuals to generate QR codes for multiple cryptocurrencies, making payments seamless and efficient. Check out the API here: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/).

# What Makes Our QR Code Generator the Best?

Our API is designed to remove the friction from crypto transactions. Here’s why it stands out:

1. **Multi-Currency Support:** Generate QR codes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Bitcoin SV, and Cardano.
2. **Seamless Integration:** Works with websites, wallets, and merchant platforms.
3. **Instant Payments:** No need for manual entry; just scan and pay.
4. **Security Focused:** No third-party risks, just direct crypto transactions.
5. **Customization:** Add specific amounts, messages, and labels to the QR codes.

# Love Won't Buy You Coffee—But Bitcoin Will

Imagine this: You walk into a café and tell the barista, ""I love you."" Will they give you a free coffee? Unlikely. But scan a QR code with Bitcoin, and boom—transaction complete, coffee in hand. Love is not a universal medium of exchange. Bitcoin is.

# Why You Should Ditch Romantic Fantasies for Financial Sovereignty

In an age where relationships are fleeting and emotions are manipulated for commercial gain, why invest in something so unreliable? Love might bring temporary joy, but Bitcoin brings financial security. And when it comes to usability, our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API** makes it effortless to transact in a real, decentralized currency.

The bottom line? Love is emotional speculation. Bitcoin is mathematical certainty. And with our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API**, moving real value is as simple as scanning a code.

If you’re ready to embrace something more reliable than love, check out our API here: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/).

 Sorry this is a bit long, 

So, I (m22) ran into my ex (22F) yesterday for the first time in about five months. We ended things pretty amicably due to circumstances but it was still sad and hard for both of us. After a few weeks of no contact I did a lot of self reflecting and thought I wasn’t ready to give up yet and some of the things I could do better (she wasn’t perfect either) however, she was talking to another guy a few weeks after our breakup, but we kept talking and hooking up during that time for a few months (he never knew). Anytime it came up she was always saying she didn’t want a relationship with him and whatnot. This is where it ended a bit messy and she blew things up with that other guy by kissing some random at a bar while he was there.

I’ve been pretty upfront for those months that I wanted to see where things went and if there was something there to work out even though we were both also looking at other people (I know now this was a mistake obviously) but she also agreed somewhat but overall a lot of mixed feelings and signals on her part.

Eventually, she started being hot-and-cold, I confronted her about where we stood, and she said we needed a “clean break” because she still had feelings for the other guy. That was the last time we spoke.

Anyway, fast forward to now, about 5 months after no contact (except once where she texted me saying she hopes I was alright after a hurricane) we ran into each other randomly yesterday and we ended up talking for about an hour. She was smiling a lot, seemed a bit awkward, stayed past her work break was supposed to be over, and made a few comments that stuck with me. She mentioned having a dream the night before that I texted her and joked that she “manifested” running into me. She also said she walks through my college department every day on her way to her bus stop and wonders if she’ll run into me.

She suggested twice that we should get coffee and catch up. The second time was while we were saying goodbye, and I kind of brushed it off, saying something like, “You let me know and shoot me a text.” She then said, “No, you should text me—I suggested it, the ball’s in your court.”

A few hours later that night, she texted me basically saying that it was really nice catching up and wishing me luck that for a meeting I was there for. I basically said the same that it was nice seeing her as well and glad she’s doing well. She hasn’t responded to that yet. Idk why she suggested a catch up like an hour long conversation wasn’t already a catching up?

Now I’m not sure what to do. I’d be lying if I said a part of me doesn’t still have lingering feelings, and I’ve been thinking about her a lot the past couple of weeks, but I also am not sure if I could take her back after everything. But maybe I could if it came down to it? Like it’s been some time and it was a messy and confusing time post breakup for everyone and I can forgive her for how I was treated towards the end, but it’s also hard to shake that she basically chose another guy over me. I sure as hell don’t think I can be friends with her though. I feel like I should let her make the next move, but since she told me the ball is in my court, maybe she’s expecting me to reach out. I really don’t know what she wants here or what she’s feeling and idk why a part of me wants to feel this out, curiosity maybe. I won’t allow myself to get strung around again for months like last time that’s for sure.

Should I just leave it and see if she reaches out again? Or should I text her something like, “If you’re still up for catching up, maybe sometime next week?” I feel like if I don’t say anything, this could be where the conversation dies. I’d appreciate any advice thanks.",1,1741215911.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

1j4gvz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1j4gvz5/update_levothyroxine_tsh_zepbound_and_protein/,"Update: Levothyroxine, TSH, Zepbound, and protein shakes","**TL;DR: protein shakes mess up your levothyroxine absorption, timing is everything.**

I know that there are many of us here with hypothyroidism.

In December my PCP reduced my levothyroxine dosage drastically after I lost 35 lbs, and I suddenly had 100 pills EACH of two dosages.

New year, new new insurancee, and the new endocrinologist recommended half pill of each dosage for a more moderate drop.

About the same time, I began replacing morning coffee with one Fairlife 26g chocolate shake, heated up and instant coffee added. Well, those shakes interfered with the levothyroxine my TSH shot up to 7.7 when I tested in early February.  

Because of that TSH of 7.7, I started taking the levo last thing before bed. No shakes after 5pm, and no food after 7pm so the levothyroxine is nice and lonely at 11pm. 

I tested again this week and my TSH was 2.2, yay.  I get my 'official' blood test with the endocrinologist in another 3 weeks, and we shall see if the trend continues.

FYI, I ordered the two blood test I took in between endo visits on my own thru [drsays.com](http://drsays.com) because I didn't want to wait from Jan until my March visit. It's a good resource for the curious and impatient. You still go to Labcorp, it's not a home test kit. ",2,1741215826.0,Zepbound,2,1.0,False

1j4gu8f,https://i.redd.it/r91sgrm9cyme1.jpeg,GCGC Update 🎀,"I love the game 🥹 even with its faults I’m actually impressed with the way it’s been out for less than a week and it’s been having routine bug fixes that most players are seeing. So we’ve technically been here since the beginning. I wasn’t able to be here when GPGP launched but compared to pizza, this is much more relaxing (for me) even with the pizza having autobuddies. It keeps my mind pretty busy with multitasking since we aren’t using autobuddies yet. Also, it’s very realistic (to me) on how your thoughts work when it comes to drink orders as a barista! 

Tips:
1. Until they fix it (hopefully they don’t) for steaming milk, you can quickly raise the pitcher up and then down and it doesn’t mess up the lattes you make that require steamed milk. I.e., you don’t have to fill the bars all the way. HOWEVER, if your daily quest requires you steam the milk perfectly for a certain amount of orders, or you need to make a certain amount of perfect drinks, you NEED to fill the bar completely like you normally would 🎀

2. Don’t wait to update your appliances. Obviously save up to upgrade the basic brew and basic grinder to at least not break as often and bring in more revenue and hold more grounds before reloading. Save up diamonds and coffee coins (the yellow coins when you level up) because you need them for when you buy the Luxe or if you want the Java (120 diamonds for the Java Brew and Grinder which I have) 💗

3. SAVE. YOUR. GEMS. WATCH. ALL. ADS. The ads are limited as is so watch ALLLLLL of them 🩷

4. Do NAWT worry about decorating your shop until you upgrade those appliances. You’ll regret it and feel like you’re not making a dime because of your appliances are shitty, your profit is shitty 🎀

5. WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR DRINKS, FOR ICED DRINKS, YOU CAN DO ICE, SYRUP, COFFEE, MILK THE REST OF THE WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CUP, AND THEN TOPPINGS IF THEY ARE REQUIRED. It’s been countless people having to say that you can build the latte bottom up and not be penalized. When we get frustrated at you guys for complaining about making the drinks and trying to make them look like the photo after telling you over and over how to make it the other way (that works), you can’t get mad when we get mad because you’re being purposely obtuse 😔 
 
And a reminder: ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY. GPGP came out for iOS and Android, and Mac, and Windows around 2020-23. It took 2-5 years for GPGP to get to where it’s at now. Maybe a lot of you guys aren’t considerate of that because you started playing after it was released and bugs were mostly fixed years later so it feels perfect and there’s a bunch of events and chapters posted, but you have to learn patience and grace as you’re part of the percent that started playing this on release day or even played it on beta 🎀

1j4gpk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSeattle/comments/1j4gpk6/advice_on_neighborhoodsapartments/,Advice on neighborhoods/apartments?,"Hi! I’m moving to Seattle next month for a new job and I’d appreciate any advice on good neighborhoods or apartment buildings. 28F, my main career is remote so I’d like to live somewhere that has cool coffee shops nearby to work at during the day. My new job will require me to work in the May Creek and Pioneer Square areas so I’m hoping to not have a bad commute to either spot. I live alone with a cat and I’m looking for a one bed or studio apartment that is ideally less than $1800, with a secure parking garage, in-unit washer and dryer, and AC. Any tips you might have are super helpful! ",1,1741215390.0,AskSeattle,4,1.0,False
1j4goy7,https://v.redd.it/fa7p1z96byme1,"Boiler not heating, no water from the group or steam wand.","Please help! I have a barista gadgets PID installed (by someone smarter than me) and it’s worked great for a year. I installed the shades of coffee super steam two weeks ago and it’s been working great. No issues at all. 

Today I made two espressos and steamed around 200ml of milk. The super steam causes the boiler temp to get up to around 170c even with the 155c thermostat. 

I tried to let some water out of the group which usually brings the temp down fairly quickly. Nothing came out. The rest of the steam came out of the steam wand but no water at all. 

Thinking that I must have messed up the super steam install, I uninstalled it but I still have the same issue. Video is attached, any advice at all is welcome! ",5,1741215347.0,gaggiaclassic,16,0.86,False

After going through the picks a few times, I thought it would be cool to share the list of top restaurants in Jeddah, especially since many people here have trouble finding new places to try. Even though I don't fully agree with some of the rankings, it's a good chance to spark a conversation about the best spots in the city and hear about any hidden gems you think should've made the list.

Quick guide: The first three picks in any category are ranked winner, runner-up, and 3rd,  the rest are the honorable picks

My wife and I came to town to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary from Saturday through Wednesday and your city will FOREVER be a part of our hearts and our love story!

Your beaches are amazing, the food is delicious, the coffee is incredible, your busses and trolleys are clean, and I’m convinced it’s IMPOSSIBLE to find a bad place to see the sunset. We absolutely LOVE your city.

We stayed in the Pacific Beach area and visited from La Jolla to downtown over the span of four full days, and still feel like we didn’t see enough.

But thank you! Thank you for the memories, the kind, happy faces and the fun conversations with the locals we met! We’re back home safely in Fort Worth now after a good flight, but will certainly take less than 20 years to get back to SD. Be proud of your city and the awesome people there!
